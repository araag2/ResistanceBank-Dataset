A  cross-sectional  study  was  conducted  from  January  to  April  2014  on  249  apparently  healthy 
slaughtered goats at the municipal abattoir of Dire Dawa to estimate the prevalence Salmonella spp. and 
determine  the  antimicrobial  susceptibility  pattern  of  the  isolates.  A  total  of  249  goat  carcass  swab 
samples were collected using a systematic random sampling technique and examined for the presence 
of  Salmonella  spp.  Out  of  the  total  of  249  carcass  swab  samples,  44  (17.7%)  were  positive  for 
Salmonella. Of all the isolates, 41 (93.2%) were multiply antimicrobial resistant and the highest level of 
resistance  was  observed  for  tetracycline  (100%),  nitrofurans  (100%),  streptomycin  (81.8%)  and 
kanamycin  (79.5%).  However,  all  isolates  were  susceptible  to  ciprofloxacin.  The  present  study  shows 
high prevalence of Salmonella spp. contamination of goat meat and resistance of the pathogen to most 
antimicrobials  except  ciprofloxacin.  Authors  recommended  the  use  of  standardized  procedures  and 
applications  in  handling  of  goat  meat  in  the  abattoir  and  rational  use  of  antimicrobials  particularly 
ciprofloxacin.  Furthermore  studies  should  be  conducted  to 
identify  the  potential  source  of 
contamination and identification of genes responsible for antimicrobial resistance.  
 
Key words: Abattoir, antimicrobial sensitivity, goat meat, prevalence, Salmonella.

has  a  substantial  global  socioeconomic  impact  (Tassios 
et  al.,  1997;  Hansen-Wester  and  Hensel,  2001).  For 
instance,  annually  there  are  16  million  cases  of  typhoid 
fever,  1.3  billion  cases  of  gastroenteritis  and  3  million 
deaths worldwide due to Salmonella (Bhunia, 2008).  

Antimicrobial-resistant  Salmonella  are  increasing  due 
to  the  use  of  antimicrobial  agents  in  food  producing 
animals.  This  may  markedly  increase  the  human  health 
risks  associated  with  consumption  of  meat  products 
contaminated  with  antimicrobial-resistant  Salmonella. 
Animals  have  been  implicated  as  a  source  of  human 
infection  with  antimicrobial  resistant  Salmonella  (Zewdu 
and Cornelius, 2009; Zelalem et al., .2011).  

from  goats  meat  and  determine 

Several  studies  showed  the presence of  Salmonella  in 
humans,  animals,  animal  food  products  in many  parts  of 
the  world  (Nyeleti  et  al.,  2000;  Muleta  and  Ashenafi, 
2001;  Molla  et  al.,  2003;  Tibaijuka  et  al.,  2003; 
Woldemariam  et  al.,  2005,  Asrat,  2008).  There  is  little 
published  information  on  the  carriage  of  Salmonella  in 
goats,  although  goat  meat  has  been  implicated  as  a 
source  of  Salmonella  spp.  food  poisoning  (Nabbut  and 
Al-Nakhli, 1982; Chandra et al., 2007; Duffy et al., 2009).  
Few studies have been conducted in Ethiopia to isolate 
Salmonella 
the 
antimicrobial  susceptibility  of  the  isolates.  These  studies 
focused  only  in  the  central  part  of  the  country  and  on 
export  abattoirs  (Molla  et  al.,  1999,  2003,  2006; Wassie, 
2004;  Woldemariam  et  al.,  2005;  Akafete  and  Haileleul, 
2011).  However,  there  has  been  no  report  regarding  the 
status  of  antibiotic  susceptibility  of  Salmonella  spp.  from 
Dire Dawa municipal abattoir. The objectives of this study 
were  to  estimate  the  prevalence  of  Salmonella  spp.  and 
antimicrobial  susceptibility  of  Salmonella  isolates  from 
apparently  healthy  goats  slaughtered  at  Dire  Dawa 
municipal abattoir. 
 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Study site  
 
This  study  was conducted  between  January,  2014  and  April,  2014 
at  Dire  Dawa  Administration  (DDA)  situated  at  515  km  from  Addis 
Ababa,  in  the  eastern  part  of  Ethiopia.  It  lies  between  90°  27'  and 
90°  49'N  latitudes  and  between  41°  38'  and  42°  19'E  longitudes. 
The rainfall is bimodal and characterized by light rain from February 
to  May  and  heavy  rain  from  July  to  September.  The  mean  annual 
rainfall  in  the  study  area  varies  from  550  to  850  mm.  The  monthly 
mean temperature ranges from 14.5 to 34.6°C (DDAEPA, 2011).  
 
 
Study design and population  
 
A  cross-sectional  study  involving  microbiological  analysis  was 
employed 
isolate  Salmonella  spp.  The  study  population 
comprised  apparently  health  goats  slaughtered  at  the  Dire  Dawa 
municipal abattoir.  
 
 
Sample collection 
 
Two  hundred forty nine (249) swab  samples were selected using a 

to 

 
 
 
 
systematic  randomly  technique  from  apparently  healthy  goats 
during  slaughtering  operations  aseptically  according  to  ISO-17604 
(2003).  The  abdomen  (flank),  thorax  (lateral),  crutch,  breast 
(lateral),  were  the  sampling  sites.  Swab  samples  were  taken  from 
each  delineated  sampling  area  and  all  swab  samples  from  a  goat 
were  pooled  together  and  kept  in  a  bottle  containing  buffered 
peptone  water.  Samples  were  kept  in  boxes  containing  ice  packs 
and  transported 
to  the  College  of  Veterinary  Medicine  and 
Agriculture, Addis Ababa University for isolation of Salmonella spp. 
 
 
Salmonella isolation  
 
Salmonella was isolated  according to the technique recommended 
by  the  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO-6579, 
2002).  The  swab  samples  were  pre-enriched  in  buffered  peptone 
water  and  incubated  at  37°C  for  24  h.  About  0.1  ml  of  the  pre-
enriched  sample  was  transferred  into  a  tube  containing  10  ml  of 
Rappaport- Vassiliadis broth and incubated at 42°C for 24 h and 1 
ml of the pre-enriched broth was transferred into a tube containing 
10  ml  of  Müller  Kauffman  Tetrathionate  with  novobiocin  broth  and 
incubated  at  37°C  for  24  h.  A  loop  of  inoculums  from  each  broth 
culture was streaked onto Xylose lysine desoxycholate  and brilliant 
green agar  plates and  incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Five typical or 
suspected  colonies  of  Salmonella  were  selected  from  the  plates 
and  further  streaked  onto  the  surface  of  pre-dried  nutrient  agar 
plates  and  incubated  at  37°C  for  24  h.  Further  biochemical  tests 
using  triple  sugar  iron  agar,  L-lysine  decarboxylation  medium, 
urease and indole production tests were done to isolate Salmonella 
spp. 
 
 
Antimicrobial susceptibility tests 
 
The  antimicrobial  susceptibility 
isolates  was 
performed  by  using  the  disc-diffusion  method  according  to  the 
recommendations of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory 
Standards  (NCCLS,  2002).  Four  to  five  well-isolated  colonies  from 
nutrient  agar  plates  were  transferred  into  tubes  containing  5  ml  of 
tryptone  soya  broth  (Oxoid,  England).  The  broth  culture  was 
incubated  at  37°C  for  4  h  until  it  achieved  the  0.5  McFarland 
turbidity  standards.  A  sterile  cotton  swab  was  dipped  into  the 
suspension, rotated several times, pressed firmly on the inside wall 
of  the  tube  above  the  fluid  level  to  remove  excess  inoculum  and 
swabbed  uniformly  over  the  surface  of  Muller  Hinton  agar  plate 
(Oxoid, England). The plates were kept at room temperature for 30 
min  to  allow  drying.  Antibiotic  discs  were  placed  at  least  15  mm 
apart on the plates and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The diameter of 
the  zones  of  inhibitions  was  compared  with  recorded  diameters  of 
the  control  organism  E.  coli  ATCC  25922  and  classified  as 
resistant,  intermediate  or  susceptible  according  to  the  interpretive 
standards  of  the  Clinical  Laboratory  Standards  Institute  (CLSI, 
2012). 
 
 
Data management and analysis 
 
The data collected from laboratory investigations were entered into 
Microsoft  Excel  and  analyzed  using  SPSS  statistical  software 
version 20. Descriptive statistics such as frequency and percentage 
were  used  to  present  the  data.  P  <0.05  was  used  to  see  the 
significant  difference  among

(17.7%)  were  positive  for  Salmonella.  The  antimicrobial 
susceptibility  testing  of  the  isolates  indicated  the  highest 
level  of  resistance  for  tetracycline  (100%),  nitrofurantoin 
(100%),  streptomycin  (81.8%)  and  kanamycin  (79.5%). 
All isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin (Table 1). Of 
all  the  isolates,  41(93.2%)  were  multiple  antimicrobial 
resistant (Table 2).  

In the present study, out of the total 249 pooled carcass 
swab  samples,  44  (17.7%)  were  positive  for  Salmonella 
spp.  This  percentage  is  higher  in  comparison  with  the 
reports of Akafete and Haileleul (2011) and Woldemariam 
et  al.  (2005)  which  are  8.3  and  7.5%  from  export 
abattoirs, respectively. This difference might be attributed 
to  differences  in  the  hygienic  and  sanitary  practices 
practiced  in  the  respective  abattoirs.  The  current  study 
was  done  on  municipal  abattoir  that  may  have  poor 
sanitation and hygienic standards in comparison with the 
export  abattoirs.  Moreover, 
level  of 
contamination  with  Salmonella  spp.  could  be  associated 
with  high  excretion  of  Salmonella  spp.  with  faeces  as 
source of contamination due to exposure to predisposing 
factors  such  as  starvation,  overcrowding  in  the  market 
and transportation (Venter et al., 1994).  This overall high 
level of carcass contamination with  Salmonella spp. is of 
special  public  health  significance  for  a  country  like 
Ethiopia  where  consumption  of  raw  and  undercooked 
meat is common. 

the  high 

The current study showed that Salmonella spp. isolates 
were resistant to commonly used antimicrobials including 
tetracycline,  nitrofurans,  streptomycin,  kanamycin  and 
ampicillin with resistance rate of 100, 100, 81.8, 79.5 and 
54.5%,  respectively.  This  result  is  in  agreement  with  the 
reports  of  other  researchers 
from  a  different  area 
(Akinyemia  et  al.,  2005;  Suresh  et  al.,  2006;  Akoachere 
et  al.,  2009;  Zewdu  and  Cornelius,  2009;  Zelalem  et  al., 
2011).  

In 

the  present  study,  ciprofloxacin  showed  good 
antimicrobial  activity  against  Salmonella  spp.  isolates. 
We found that all 44 (100%) isolates were susceptible to 
ciprofloxacin.  This  result  was  comparable  to  previous 
reports  (Molla  et  al.,  2006;  Akinyemia  et  al.,  2005; 
Zelalem et al., 2011) on isolates of Salmonella spp. from 
different  animals  and  humans.  The  effectiveness  of 
ciprofloxacin might be attributable to infrequent use of the 
drug  for  the  treatment  of  animals  and  humans  in  the 
country  indicating  the  benefit  of  rational  use  of  the  drug 
(Zelalem et al., 2011). 

Resistance 

to  multiple  antimicrobials  which  was 
observed  in  the  current  study  (93.2%)  was  higher  than 
the  reports  of  other  studies  conducted  in  Ethiopia.  For 
instance, Alemayehu et al. (2002), Endrias (2004), Molla 
et al. (2004) and Zelalem et al. (2011) reported 52, 23.5, 
44.8  and  83.3%,  respectively.  In  addition,  the  finding  of 
the  present  study  was  higher  in  comparison  with  reports 
on  multidrug resistance  of  Salmonella  isolated from food 
of animal sources, animals and humans elsewhere in the 
world (Stevens et al., 2006; Khaitsa et al., 2007; Al-Bahry 
et  al.,  2007;  Elgroud  et  al.,  2009;  Fadlalla  et  al.,  2012). 
This  difference  could  be  due  to  the  use  of  antimicrobial 
agents  in  food  producing  animals  and  humans  at  sub-
therapeutic level or prophylactic doses and indiscriminate 
use  of  antimicrobials  (Molla  et  al.,  2003,  2006;  Zewdu 
and  Cornelius,  2009).  The  continuing  development  of 
antibiotic  resistance  may  lead  to  sufficient  pressure 
ultimately  to  restrict  the  antibiotics  available  to  the 
veterinary profession for animal treatment (Gracey et al., 
1999).  Moreover,  this  increase  antibiotic  resistance  may 
lead  to  public  health  problems  and  economic  loss  in  the 
countries  due  to  loss  of  exporting  meat  and  animal 
products and cost of drugs to treat human and animals. 

In conclusion, the present study shows high prevalence 
of  Salmonella  spp.  contaminating  goat  meat  and
