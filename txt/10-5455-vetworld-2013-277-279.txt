Abstract

Aim: Isolation, characterization, in-vitro pathogenicity and antibiogram study of E.coli from buffalo meat sold in Parbhani city.
Materials and Methods: Meat samples were collected from buffalo immediately after slaughter. Isolation, identification and 
enumeration of E. coli were done by following standard methods and protocols.  Hemolysin test and Congo red binding assay 
were  used  to  study  in-vitro  pathogenicity  of  E.  coli  isolates.  Disc  diffusion  method  was  used  to  study  antibiogram  of 
pathogenic E. coli isolates.
Results: A total of 250 buffalo meat samples were collected and processed.  A total of 22 (8.80 percent) E. coli isolates were 
isolated with average differential count of 1.231 ± 0.136 log  cfu/g on EMB agar. All the E. coli isolates were confirmed by 
Grams staining, biochemical reactions and sugar fermentation and motility tests. A total of 9 (3.6 percent) E. coli isolates were 
found to be pathogenic by in-vitro pathogenicity testing.  Antibiogram studies of pathogenic E. coli isolates showed that all 9 
isolates were sensitive to gentamycin (20 ± 1.49 mm) while 7 isolate showed resistance to enrofloxacin (18.22 ± 3.58 mm) and 
tetracycline (11.44 ± 2.04 mm). 
Conclusion: Buffalo meat sold in Parbhani city is an important source of E. coli   infection to human population. A total   of   9 
pathogenic E. coli were isolated from buffalo meat immediately after slaughter. All isolates were characterized and confirmed 
pathogenic by in-vitro pathogenicity tests. Antibiogram studies of all isolates revealed sensitivity to gentamicin and resistance 
to tetracycline and enrofloxacin.

India is a leading exporter of buffalo (Bubalus 
bubalis) meat earning foreign exchange. The production 
of buffalo meat (beef) is increasing by 4.5 percent per 
annum [1]. According to Animal Husbandary statistical 
database of Department of Animal Husbandary, Dairying 
and  Fisheries  (DADF),  there  are  a  total  of  5,520 
recognized and 4,707 unrecognized slaughter houses 
in the country. The buffalo carcass has less fat, less 
bone and higher proportion of muscle than cattle [2]. 
Sanitary indices refer to certain organisms or group of 
organisms  which  indicates  presence  of  potentially 
pathogenic  or  spoilage  organisms  in  food.  Coliform 
organisms in food indicate poor sanitary practices and 
presence  of  other  hazardous  organisms.  This  group 
includes E. coli and enumeration of E. coli counts is 
important to determine sanitary indices [2]. Presence of  Materials and Methods
E.  coli  in  food  is  an  indicator  of  poor  sanitary 
conditions during processing. Isolation of E. coli from 
meat and meat products is a common phenomenon [3, 
4]. Studies showed that normal intestinal microflora 
specially commmensal E .coli strains under specific 
condition, might serve as reservoir of resistance genes 
that could be acquired by pathogenic bacteria [5]. Since 
commensal bacterial strains are exposed to the same 
selective pressure as pathogenic strains, they might be 
used  as  an  indicator  of  trends  in  antimicrobial 
resistance [6]. Also E. coli being a member of Entero-
bacteriacae is being exposed to various antibiotics and 
www.veterinaryworld.org

antimicrobial  agents  in  maintenance  of  hygiene  in 
animal  husbandry  practices  as  well  as  during 
processing of meat. This results into development of 
drug resistant condition. Antibiotic resistance to beef 
borne E. coli is well documented [8,9]. 

The growing problem of antibiotic resistant has 
become a significant public health concern world wide. 
All  uses  of  antimicrobial  in  human  medicine  and 
animal husbandry create selective pressure that favors 
emergence of antimicrobial resistance among micro-
organism [7].

Keeping in view the public health importance and 
hazards caused by pathogenic E. coli, the present study 
was undertaken to isolate and identify these pathogenic 
and drug resistant organisms from buffalo meat sold in 
Parbhani city. 

Sample collection and processing: Buffalo beef samples 
were  collected  from  Parbhani  Municipal  Council 
Abattoir. A total of 250 meat samples approximately 
weighing  50  gm  were  collected  from  neck  site  of 
slaughtered  animal  in  sterile  polyethylene  schachets 
for  the  period  from  December  2011  to  May  2012. 
These  meat  samples  collected  were  brought  to  the 
laboratory  on  ice  within  one  hour  and  processed 
immediately.

positivity  of  hemolysin  test  and  Congo  red  binding 
assay observed was 3.60 percent. All 9 pathogenic E. 
coli isolates were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity test 
against gentamycin, tetracycline and enrofloxacin. The 
zones  of  inhibition  of  antibiotic  were  recorded. The 
average zone of inhibition seen were gentamicin (20.00 
±1.49mm), enrofloxacin (18.22±3.58mm) and tetracycline 
(11.44±2.04  mm).  All  9  isolates  were  sensitive  to 
gentamicin while 7 isolates showed resistance to enroflo-
xacin and Tetracycline. A complete sensitivity of all 9 
isolates (100 percent) was observed against gentamicin. 

In  present  study,  very  low  percentage(  08.80 
percent) of E. coli was isolated. The findings of present 
study  are  in  agreement  with  earlier  reports  [3,15].       
The E. coli counts are in the of range 6.85 to 7.40 log10 
cfu/g [16]. Scanning of available literature reveals that 
percentage of E. coli isolation and identification varies 
considerably [17,18]. The variation in percentage of E. 
coli  isolation  and  identification  may  be  due  to 
difference in hygienic conditions at different slaughter 
houses.

All the 22 E. coli isolates shown typical Grams 
staining reaction, biochemical reactions, motility and 
sugar  fermentation  reactions  described  earlier  [11]. 
Many workers successfully used staining characters, 
biochemical  reactions,  sugar  fermentation  reactions 
and  motility  patterns  for  confirmation  of  E.  coli 
isolated from meat [19].

described in BAM [10]. A quantity of 10gm of beef 
sample was minced with the help of sterile scissors and 
mixed in 90 ml normal saline solution (pH 7.2) in screw 
cap bottle. Ten fold serial dilutions were made up to 10
dilution in normal saline solution (pH 7.2). A quantity 
of 0.1 ml inoculam from 10 and 10 dilutions was used 
by spread plate technique on Eosin Metheline Blue agar 
(EMB) (Himedia Laboratories, Mumbai). Incubation was 
done at 37 C for 24 hrs and colony counts were taken. 
Typical characteristics colony of E. coli on EMB agar 
as greenish metallic sheen was enumerated and isolated. 
Identification of E. coli was done by biochemical test  Discussion
i.e IMViC, catalase, oxidase & nitrate reduction and 
sugar fermentation and motility tests. [11].   
In-vitro pathogenicity test of E. coli: In-vitro patho-
genicity test of confirmed E. coli isolates was done by 
heamolysis  and  Congo  red  binding  assay  [12,13]. 
Colonies  showing  hemolytic  zone  are  considered  as 
heamolytic positive. While isolates, producing intense 
orange or brick red colour on Congo red medium were 
considered  as  positive  and  those  producing  grayish 
white colonies recorded as negative.
Antibiogram  of  E.  coli:  Antibiotic  sensitivity  of  all 
pathogenic E. coli isolates was done by disc diffusion 
method [14] on Muller-Hinkton agar. Three antimicro-
bial discs were used with different concentrations viz, 
Gentamycin  (10  mcg),  Tetracycline  (30mcg)  and 
Enrofloxacin (10mcg). Zones of complete inhibition 
were measured in millimeter with rule. 
Results

Hemolysis of sheep RBC is an important criterion 
for identification of pathogenic strains of E. coli. In-
250  buffalo  meat  samples  were  screened  for 
vitro pathogenecity studies of hemolytic E. coli were 
isolation of E. coli on EMB agar. A total of 22 E. coli 
done by using 5 percent sheep blood agar [20]. Many 
isolates  were  obtained.  The  isolates  were  identified  workers successfully used Congo red binding assay in 
based upon colony characteristics comprising of bluish 
tryptose soya agar for identification of pathogenic E. 
green  metallic  sheen.  The  percentage  of  E.  coli 
coli [20-22]. The observations are in agreement with 
isolation observed was 8.80 percent. Having average 
earlier workers [20,21].
differential count of 22 isolates of E. coli on EMB agar 
Antimicrobial  sensitivity  testing  of  the  patho-
observed was 1.231 ± 0.136 log cfu/ gm. A total of 22 
genic E. coli isolated from beef samples confirms that 
all  9  pathogenic  isolates  were  highly  sensitive  to 
E. coli isolates were subjected to identification based 
upon  Grams  staining,  biochemical  characters,  sugar  Gentamycin.  Out  of  nine  isolates  7  isolates  shown 
fermentation and motility tests. All the 22 isolates were 
resistance  to  Enrofloxacin  and  Tetracycline.  Similar 
subjected  to  in-vitro  pathogenecity  test  that  is 
reports in previous studies showed resistance of meat 
hemolysin test and Congo red binding assay.  A total of 
borne E. coli to Gentamycin and Enrofloxacin [23], 
9 E. coli isolates were found positive for pathogenecity 
Tetracycline  and  Ciprofloxacin  [24,25].  In  present 
in both the in-vitro pathogenecity tests. The percent

in 2 isolates but at low level. 

The resistance of pathogenic E. coli to the antibiotics 
may  be  due  to  indiscriminate  use  of  antibiotics  in 
animal husbandry practices. Pathogenic E. coli of meat 
origin are always having grater potential to enter into 
food chain. Buffalo meat, beef and other types of meat 
are cheap source of human infection [4,26].
Conclusion

Buffalo meat sold in Parbhani city is an important 
source of E. coli infection to human population. All 
isolates were characterized and confirmed pathogenic 
by in-vitro pathogenicity tests. Antibiogram studies of 
all  isolates  revealed  sensitivity  to  gentamicin  and 
resistance to tetracycline and enrofloxacin.
