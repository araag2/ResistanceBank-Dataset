An investigation was undertaken to determine the occurrence, antibiotic resistance and bioﬁlm formation
of Salmonella spp. isolated from a chicken slaughter plant in Anhui, China. A total of 104 samples (52 from
chicken carcasses and 52 from processing contact-surfaces) were collected from three processing points in
a chicken slaughterhouse. The 23 isolates (22.1%, 23/104) were conﬁrmed for Salmonella and belonged to
six different serotypes, including S. Indiana (n ¼ 9), S. Infantis (n ¼ 4), S. Derby (n ¼ 3), S. Heidelberg (n ¼ 2),
S. Agona (n ¼ 2) and S. Typhimurium (n ¼ 1), whereas two isolates (n ¼ 2) were non-typable. Signiﬁcant
differences in occurrence were found between post-evisceration, post-chilling and post-grading
processing points. A total of 20 (87%, 20/23) isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic, of which 19
isolates (95%, 19/20) showed 13 multiple antibiotic resistance patterns against 11 different antibiotics.
Resistance to ampicillin (78.3%, 18/23) was the most common. The multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR)
index varied from 0.27 to 0.91. The Salmonella isolates from the chicken plant and from humans in the same
area who were suffering Salmonella infections showed similar antimicrobial resistance patterns, namely
resistance to ampicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, gentamicin, chloramphenicol and tretracycline,
and abbreviated as “ATsGCT”. Meanwhile, Salmonella isolates exhibited variation in bioﬁlm-forming
behavior with regards to the incubation media and serotypes, a relatively high bioﬁlm production was
observed for S. Agona incubated in MTLB (meat thawing-loss broth) at 72 h. There was no signiﬁcant
correlation between antimicrobial resistance and bioﬁlm formation of isolates. Our ﬁndings provide
baseline information on the distribution of Salmonella serovars in this plant, and provide support to the
need for improved farming practice and for more prudent use of antimicrobial agents.

1. Introduction

Salmonella spp. is a globally widespread food-borne pathogen,
and its outbreaks are commonly associated with the consumption of
contaminated food such as eggs, poultry meat and pork. In EU, Sal-
monella has become the major cause of food poisoning (EFSA-ECDC,
2012a), while in the USA, contaminated food with Salmonella has
resulted in numerous recalls and outbreaks during 2012 that have
been addressed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Center for
Disease Control and Prevention (www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls).

Recently, much research interest has been drawn to the high
occurrence, and antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella in livestock
for food products, which may have the potential to transmit to
humans through the food chain. Epidemiological studies have

implicated foods of animal origin as the major vehicles associated
with illnesses caused by Salmonella (Dallal et al., 2010). Despite the
occurrence of Salmonella in raw and retail cooked meats have
previously been reported (Cook, Odumeru, Lee, & Pollari, 2012;
Fearnley, Raupach Lagala, & Cameron, 2011), information on the
occurrence of Salmonella at slaughter facilities is limited, even
though it is considered as the main source of cross-contamination.
Investigation of occurrence of Salmonella in slaughter plants may
aid in optimizing HACCP strategy and ensure meat safety in China.
Furthermore, investigation of the occurrence and distribution of
Salmonella at different slaughter processing stations would be of
beneﬁt for the study of the quantitative exposure assessment of
Salmonella in chicken meat.

Emergence of multiple resistance of Salmonella isolates and
special antimicrobial resistance patterns have raised increasing
concern among governments all over the world (Chao, Zhou, Jiao,
Qian, & Xu, 2007; EFSA-ECDC, 2012b; Thong & Modarressi, 2011).
The link between antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella isolates and

H. Wang et al. / Food Control 33 (2013) 378e384

outbreaks of human poisoning has already been demonstrated
(Folster et al., 2012). In China, human foodborne illnesses have been
associated with the antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella isolates
(Ran et al., 2011; Yu, Chen, Yu, Li, et al., 2011; Yu, Chen, Yu, Pan, et al.,
2011), especially the antibiotic-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium
and Salmonella Enteritidis have caused human suffering from
serious diarrhoea,
the general resistance antibiotics included
chloramphenicol, ampicillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole, genta-
micin etc., and the common multiple resistance patterns were
ACTsT type (resistance to at least ampicillin, chloramphenicol,
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline). Therefore, moni-
toring of Salmonella occurrence and its antimicrobial resistance in
the meat-food supply, especially for raw meat in the slaughter
plant, is necessary because of the public health implications of a
potential spread of antimicrobial resistant Salmonella.

Salmonella can grow as surface-associated aggregates on food
contact-surfaces and equipment (Chia, Goulter, McMeekin, Dykes,
& Fegan, 2009), commonly referred to as bioﬁlms. The cells in
bioﬁlms are potential sources of contamination of food products.
Bioﬁlms may play a crucial role in the survival of Salmonella under
unfavorable environmental conditions, such as in animal slaugh-
terhouses and processing plants. To date, relatively little research
has examined the ability of bioﬁlm formation of Salmonella isolated
from slaughter plants under the conditions commonly encoun-
tered. Moreover, the relationship between antimicrobial resistance
and the ability of Salmonella isolates to form bioﬁlms is unknown.
The present study was therefore carried out to (i) determine the
occurrence and distribution of Salmonella at processing points at a
chicken slaughterhouse, (ii) identify the antimicrobial resistance
patterns and the ability of bioﬁlm formation of Salmonella isolates,
and (iii) evaluate the correlation between number of isolates
resistant to antibiotics and bioﬁlm formation of Salmonella isolates.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sample collection

A total of 104 samples, collected from chicken carcass surfaces
(n ¼ 52) and processing contact-surfaces (n ¼ 52), were obtained
from three processing points (post-evisceration point n ¼ 40, post-
chilling point n ¼ 32 and post-grading point n ¼ 32) at a chicken
slaughter plant in Anhui Province (China), during September 2011
(Fig. 1). The samples were collected on each Wednesday of three
consecutive weeks (35, 35 and 34 samples at each time, respec-
tively). At each collection point, the number of the samples from
carcass surfaces was the same as that of the samples from pro-
cessing surfaces. The sample collection were performed according
to the standard methods recommended by USDA-FSIS, which
involved rinsing the whole chicken carcass with 400 mL buffered
peptone water
(BPW) and swabbing the contacted-surfaces
(including evisceration equipment, transport belts and cutting

boards) with swabs moistened with 0.1% BPW (Adzitey, Rusul, &
Huda, 2012). BPW was used as the pre-enrichment broth.

2.2.

Identiﬁcation of isolates

Salmonella isolates were identiﬁed according to the China na-
tional food safety standard methods e Food microbiological ex-
amination: Salmonella (GB 4789.4-2010). Tetrathionate broth base
(TTB) and selenite cystine (SC) broth were used as the selective
enrichment broth, and xylose lysine desoxycholate agar (XLD) and
bismuth sulﬁte agar (BS) were used as the plating media. All culture
media were obtained from Luqiao (Luqiao Technology Co. Ltd.,
China). Isolates were further identiﬁed by colony morphology,
biochemical characterization and special virulence genes (invA and
hilA) ofSalmonella , the two virulence genes were detected by PCR
(primers of invA: F-tcg tcat tcc att acc tac c, R-aaa cgt tga aaa act gag
ga; primers of hilA: F-cgc cgg cga gat tgt gag ta, R-aga ctc tcg gat tga
acc tga) (Jacobsen & Holben, 2007; McCabe, Burgess, O’Regan, et al.,
2011). Isolates were then serotyped with speciﬁc O and H Salmo-
nella antisera, and classiﬁed according to the KauffmaneWhite
scheme.

2.3. Screening for antimicrobial resistance

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was determined by the disk
diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar, using 11 different anti-
biotics belonging to 7 different classes. The antibiotics used were as
follows, penicillins (ampicillin, 10 mg), cephalosporins (cefalothin,
30 mg; cefoxitin, 30 mg; ceftriaxone, 30 mg), aminoglycosides (ami-
kacin, 30 mg; gentamicin, 30 mg), tetracyclines (tetracycline, 30 mg),
quinolones (ciproﬂoxacin, 5 mg; enroﬂoxacin, 5 mg), amphenicols
(chloramphenicol, 5 mg), sulfonamides (compound sulfamethoxa-
zole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole), 1.25/23.75 mg). The results
were interpreted according to the standard of “Performance stan-
dards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing” recommended by
Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) of USA. The strain
Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was used as quality control strain. The
antimicrobial resistance of each isolate was performed with three
repetitions. The multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index was
calculated with previous method (Adzitey et al., 2012) and by
employing the following formula: MAR index ¼ (Number of resis-
tance antibiotics per isolate)/(total number of antibiotics tested).
Isolates classiﬁed as intermediate on the basis of the inhibition
zone were considered as sensitive for the MAR index (Singh, Yadav,
Singh, & Bharti, 2010).

2.4. Preparation of inocula

Isolates were individually cultured and sub-cultured (37 C,
24 h) in tryptic soytone broth (TSB). Cells were centrifuged, and cell
pellets were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline
(PBS, pH 7.2). Each pellet was resuspended in PBS and adjusted to a
ﬁnal concentration of 108 CFU/mL. In order to simulate contami-
nation of surfaces in meat processing plants, chicken meat
thawing-loss broth (MTLB) was used as a culture medium. It was
prepared as described previously (Midelet & Carpentier, 2002). The
protein content of MTLB was adjusted to a ﬁnal concentration of
5 mg/mL using the Biuret protein assay.

2.5. Bioﬁlm assay

An aliquot (20 mL, 107 CFU/mL) of each isolated culture was
transferred to 180 mL of fresh TSB or MTLB in a 96-well polystyrene
microplate. The microplates were then incubated at 18 C and the
bioﬁlm was assayed at 24 h and 72 h. The two broths, devoid of

380

bacterial inocula, served as negative controls. Following incubation,
wells were rinsed three times with sterile de-ionized water and the
plates were air-dried for 45 min, and then each well was stained
with 200 mL of 0.25% (wt/vol) crystal violet for 30 min (Kim & Wei,
2009). The staining solution was then removed, and the wells were
rinsed three times with sterile de-ionized water. The crystal violet
bound to the bioﬁlm was then solubilized with 200 mL of 95%
ethanol for 30 min. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm
(Silagyi, Kim, Lo, & Wei, 2009).

2.6. Statistical analysis

The chi-square test was performed to compare the occurrence of
Salmonella spp. between different processing points. Pearson’s and
Spearman’s correlations between number of isolates resistant to
antibiotics and amount of bioﬁlm formation was determined using
SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). In all cases, the level of sta-
tistical signiﬁcance was p < 0.05.

3. Results

3.1. The occurrence of Salmonella spp.

Fig. 2. Occurrence of contamination of Salmonella spp. Chi-square test (Fisher) was
performed on samples at each processing point, values with different lower-case
letters (a and b) at each processing point are signiﬁcant different (p < 0.05).

Of the samples tested, 22% (23/104) were positive for Salmonella.
In addition to identiﬁcation of the isolates by biochemical charac-
terization, we further identiﬁed them by detecting invA and hilA
genes, which are commonly used as the PCR diagnostic targets for
Salmonella in the food industry and research ﬁelds (Joshi et al.,
2009; McCabe, Burgess, Walsh, et al., 2011). The results (Table 1)
indicated that all the 23 isolates were positive for detection of invA
and hilA genes. These isolates were serotyped into 6 serovars
(Table 1), including S. Indiana (n ¼ 9), S. Derby (n ¼ 3), S. Heidelberg
(n ¼ 2), S. Agona (n ¼ 2), S. Infantis (n ¼ 4), S. Typhimurium (n ¼ 1).
However, two isolates (n ¼ 2) obtained from processing contacted-
surfaces which were conﬁrmed for Salmonella spp. by biochemical
characterization and detection of virulence genes were non-
typable. 19% (10/52) and 25% (13/52) of Salmonella were identi-
ﬁed from chicken carcasses and from contact-surfaces, respectively.
S. Heidelberg and S. Typhimurium were identiﬁed only in samples
from contact-surfaces (Table 1).

The presence of Salmonella in post-evisceration, post-chilling
and post-grading processing points are presented in Fig. 2. There
was signiﬁcant variation (p < 0.05) in the occurrence of Salmonella
at the different processing points, where incidence levels decreased
with progress through the plant. Compared to the occurrence at the

post-evisceration point (35%), the occurrence of Salmonella signif-
icantly (p < 0.05) decreased at post-chilling (19%) and post-grading
(9%) points. However, compared to the decrease of occurrence at
post-chilling point associating with the low occurrence of car-
casses, the decrease of occurrence at post-grading point mainly
resulted from the low occurrence of processing surfaces.

3.2. Antimicrobial resistance

Of 23 isolates, 78% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin
(Table 2). 13% were resistant
to cefoxitin and ciproﬂoxacin,
respectively. In addition, 74% of isolates was resistant to cefalothin,
61% to ceftriaxone, 74% to compound sulfamethoxazole, 39% to
amikacin, 48% to gentamicin, 61% to chloramphenicol, 39% to
enroﬂoxacin and 70% to tetracycline (Table 2). There were great
differences in antimicrobial resistance for each of the Salmonella
serovars (Table 2). It was found that S. Indiana, S. Typhimurium and
S. Heidelberg showed the highest percentage of resistance, fol-
lowed by S. Agona and S. Derby. Three S. Infantis isolates (C6, C8 and
C19) were susceptible to all tested antibiotics (Table 3).

Of 23 isolates, 20 showed resistance to antibiotics, 19 of
which showed multiple resistances. One isolate (C23, belonging to

S. Infantis) was only resistant to compound sulfamethoxazole, and
13 different patterns of resistance were observed (Table 3). It was
observed that isolates from processing surfaces showed resistance
to as many as 10 antibiotics, in comparison to isolates from carcass
surfaces, which were resistant to 1e5 antibiotics, except for C1
(belonging to S. Indiana) isolate which was resistant to 8 antibiotics.
The maximum and average multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR)
indices of isolates were 0.91 and 0.52, respectively, and the MAR
index of other isolates ranged from 0.27 to 0.82.

3.3. Bioﬁlm formation

The amounts of bioﬁlm formation of Salmonella isolates were
signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the types of growth media and incuba-
tion time (data not shown). Bioﬁlm formation of these isolates was
serotype dependent. Relatively high amounts of bioﬁlm were pro-
duced by S. Agona (C4), S. Infantis (C6 and C19), S. Indiana (C13 and
C16) isolates.

3.4. Correlation between number of isolates resistance to
antibiotics and the ability to produce bioﬁlm

A preliminary correlation analysis was carried out to determine
whether any relationship existed between the number of isolates
resistance to antibiotics and the ability of Salmonella isolates to
form bioﬁlm. The Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlation coefﬁcients
were shown in Table 4. The ﬁndings suggested that no signiﬁcant
correlation (p > 0.05) existed between bioﬁlm formation and the
number of antimicrobial resistant isolates.

4. Discussion

(www.cdc.gov/salmonella/outbreaks.html).

Poultry foods are generally considered to be at a higher risk
for Salmonella contamination than other foods. In 2012, several
outbreaks of Salmonella have been associated with poultry meat and
products
During
chicken slaughter, Salmonella from the gastro-intestinal tract of
chickens carrying pathogens can contaminate the carcasses and
the processing line (Rostagno, Wesley, Trampel, & Hurd, 2006).
Although efforts at controlling Salmonella have concentrated pri-
marily on controlling contamination within the slaughterhouse, a
high proportion of carcasses are still found to be contaminated with
Salmonella. In our survey, we identiﬁed six different serotypes of
Salmonella (23 isolates), S. Indiana was the common serotype, fol-
lowed by S. Infantis. As similar to our observation, a survey con-
ducted by Yang et al. (2010) in China also found that S. Indiana was
the common serotype, followed by S. Infantis. In our study, the
occurrence of Salmonella from processing surfaces (25%, 13/52) was
higher than from chicken carcasses (19%,10/52). A survey conducted
by Adzitey et al. (2012) showed a similar incidence of surface
contamination for Salmonella (23.5%) in a poultry processing envi-
ronment. However, a higher occurrence was observed in another
study (Antunes, Réu, Sousa, Peixe, & Pestana, 2003), where 60% of
poultry meat was contaminated with Salmonella. The high occur-
rence in poultry meat products indicates that the production sys-
tems and processing environments of poultry meat may facilitate
the presence of Salmonella in the ﬁnal products. In our ﬁndings
(Fig. 2), the occurrence signiﬁcantly decreased at the post-grading
point, however, there were still 3% Salmonella of the carcasses

positive in the ﬁnal products at the post-grading point (Fig. 2),
which was the last stage before packaging the product. This is not
acceptable according to the food safety standard of China (NY 5034-
2005), and the residual Salmonella may cause serious cross-
contamination during the subsequent retail process and cause
serious risk to public health. The presence of Salmonella on products
and contacted-surface indicated that appropriate hygienic mea-
sures should be applied to control Salmonella in this slaughter plant.
In our study, 87% (20/23) of the isolates were resistance to at
least one of the antibiotic tested, and 95% (19/20) of the isolates
showed multiple resistance (Table 3). The most common serotype
(S. Indiana) showed multi-drug resistant phenotypes, which also
appear to be widely available in China (Lu et al., 2011). Multidrug
resistant phenotypes also emerged in another four serotypes (S.
Derby, S. Heidelberg, S. Agona and S. Typhimurium). The presence of
multiple-resistant isolates in meat may cause serious human
poisoning, the isolates may be transferred from meat to humans, not
only through direct contact but also indirectly. This indirect transfer
involves mainly consumption of meat or other food contaminated
with Salmonella (Depoorter et al., 2012), because antibiotic resis-
tance genes frequently are located on mobile genetic elements.
Horizontal gene transfer between food bacteria and human intes-
tinal bacteria has been demonstrated, not only in vitro, but also
in vivo (Dahl et al., 2007; Smet et al., 2010). The hypothesis of
transfer of resistant Salmonella from livestock, via the consumption
of meat to humans, has been conﬁrmed, and the link between
antimicrobial resistant S. Typhimurium from pork and outbreaks of
human poisoning has already been demonstrated (Van Boxstael
et al., 2012). In our study, 14 isolates of multiple-resistant Salmo-
nella were resistant to 5e10 antibiotics, and showed 8 types of
resistance patterns, with the maximum MAR index of isolates being
0.91 (Table 3). Similar serotype and multidrug resistant patterns of
Salmonella isolate from human foodborne illness have been iden-
tiﬁed in surrounding areas of this slaughter plant (Ran et al., 2011;
Yu, Chen, Yu, Li, et al., 2011). Notably, the S. Typhimurium identiﬁed
in our study showed the multiple resistance patterns quietly similar
to the S. Typhimurium isolates found in human foodborne illness in
surrounding areas, especially the multiple resistance patterns of
ATsGCT type (resistance to at least ampicillin, trimethoprim/sulfa-
methoxazole, gentamicin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline),
which has been associated with serious diarrhoea (Yu, Chen, Yu,
Pan, et al., 2011). There may be some relationship between the
chicken meat contaminated by Salmonella in this plant and the
diarrhoea infection in surrounding areas, because the plant, which
was a large-scale chicken slaughtering and processing plant, sup-
plied the vast majority of chicken meat consumption to consumers
in surrounding areas. The contaminated chicken meat or other food
contact with the chicken meat may be the source of infection.

Ampicillin resistance has been observed amongst the Salmonella
isolates from poultry products (Adzitey et al., 2012; Antunes et al.,
2003). In our study, a total of 78% of the Salmonella isolates were

found to be resistant to ampicillin (Table 2), but this was much
lower than that reported in isolates from foods from Poland where
93% were ampicillin-resistant (Wasyl & Hoszowski, 2012). This high
antimicrobial resistance may result from extensive use or misuse of
penicillins, which has been used for therapeutics of infectious
diseases in animal feeds. Cephalosporins are usually grouped into
“generations” by their antimicrobial properties. In our study, we
found that 74%, 13% and 61% isolates were resistance to cefalothin
(ﬁrst generation), cefoxitin (second generation) and ceftriaxone
(third generation), respectively (Table 2). Compared to resistance to
ceftriaxone, we found a lower incidence of resistance to cefoxitin;
this may be caused by less use of this second generation cephalo-
sporin in therapeutics of infections, because the third generation
cephalosporin drugs were the common choice in treating life-
threatening systemic infection of animals in China (Lei et al., 2010).
Two antibiotics of the aminoglycoside class were assayed in the
present study. Unlike the high incidence of resistance to amikacin
(39%) and gentamicin (47%) in our study, a very low incidence
(<2.5%) of resistance was observed by Chao et al. (2007). High
resistance to tetracyclines (70%) was observed in our study. Tetra-
cyclines are not only used as treatments in veterinary medicine, but
also as a growth enhancer in poultry production. This practice has
greatly promoted the occurrence of antimicrobial-resistant isolates.
Compared to our study (70%), a higher incidence (100%) of resis-
tance to tetracyclines was reported by Glenn et al. (2011), however,
a lower incidence (13%) was observed by Mezali and Hamdi (2012)
in meat and meat products isolates.

In this study, the isolates showed resistance to two antibiotics
from the quinolones class, namely ciproﬂoxacin (13%) and enro-
ﬂoxacin (40%). The low incidence of resistance to ciproﬂoxacin has
also been observed in other studies. Only 3% of Salmonella isolated
from the retail meats was resistance to ciproﬂoxacin according to a
survey in Malaysia (Chia et al., 2009), and 100% of Salmonella iso-
lates isolated from meat were susceptible to ciproﬂoxacin (Singh,
Agarwal, Tiwari, & Singh, 2012). Although the resistance of quino-
lone in Salmonella remains low, outbreaks of quinolone-resistant
Salmonella infections have been reported in the United States
(CDC, 2010). In our study, we found high incidences of resistance
against chloramphenicol, a class of amphenicols (61%), and the
compound sulfamethoxazole, a class of sulfonamides (74%). The
two antibiotics are commonly used as veterinary medicines in
livestock production. Recently, an increasing occurrence of resis-
tance to the two antibiotics have already been demonstrated in
many countries (Glenn et al., 2011; Iossiﬁdou, Abrahim, Soultos,
Triantaﬁllou, & Koidis, 2012; Marrero-Ortiz et al., 2012; Van
Boxstael et al., 2012). The appearance of antimicrobial resistant
Salmonella isolates may result in serious human and livestock in-
fections, and effective strategies and new legislation must be
established to ensure a decrease in the appearance of antimicrobial
resistant isolates.

Recently, attachment and bioﬁlm formation of

food-borne
pathogens has become one of the central areas of food safety
research because of the likelihood of potential cross-contamination
and serious food safety problems. Previous studies have demon-
strated that there was a correlation between bioﬁlm formation
in vitro using polystyrene micro-wells and bioﬁlm formation on
several surfaces commonly encountered in food facilities (Patel &
Sharma, 2010; Vestby, Møretrø, Langsrud, Heir, & Nesse, 2009).
So, we evaluated the ability of bioﬁlm formation of Salmonella
isolates by polystyrene micro-wells methods, which allows large
numbers of isolates under different conditions to be studied at the
same time. In our study, a meat-based medium (MTLB) which is
equivalent to that likely to be found in meat processing facilities
and a laboratory medium (TSB, optimal for Salmonella growth)
were tested at 18 C for their inﬂuence on bioﬁlm formation of

H. Wang et al. / Food Control 33 (2013) 378e384

383

Salmonella isolates. The temperature of 18 C was selected as it is a
common temperature found in meat processing facilities in China.
Using meat-based medium as a substrate for assessing the Salmo-
nella attachment may be useful for obtaining more realistic results
than the use of a specialized laboratory medium when considering
the nutrient availability in foods and their interactions with the
surrounded environment. High inter-isolate variation in behavior
of the formation of Salmonella bioﬁlm was observed with regards to
the incubation media and incubation time, and this is consistent
with previous reports (Díez-García, Capita, & Alonso-Calleja, 2012;
Saa, Cabo, & Rodriguez, 2009). Compared to the incubation in TSB,
most of the isolates showed large differences in bioﬁlm formation
incubated in MTLB. Our results provided some information for
further supporting the contention that studying bioﬁlm formation
using a laboratory medium (TSB) has limited signiﬁcance to the
understanding of bioﬁlm formation under the processing and
handling conditions that are present in the meat industry. The
bioﬁlm formation in our study indicated that Salmonella isolates
had the potential for attachment on contact-surfaces in a meat
processing environment. The attachment Salmonella may result in
serious problems for the meat industry.

We found there was no correlation between them (Table 4).
Such a relationship has been described for other bacteria, although
the ﬁndings were sometimes inconsistent and the correlations
were species-dependent. Chen et al. (2010) showed that there was
no correlation between bioﬁlm-forming ability and drug resistance
patterns of E. coli. However, another study demonstrated that there
was a signiﬁcant positive correlation between antibiotics resistance
and bioﬁlm-forming ability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Fricks-
Lima et al., 2011).

In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the occurrence of
Salmonella in a chicken processing plant was relatively high, a total
of 23 isolates of Salmonella belonging to 6 serotypes were identi-
ﬁed, including S. Indiana, S. Derby, S. Heidelberg, S. Agona, S.
Infantis and S. Typhimurium. All
isolates showed 13 multiple
antibiotic resistance patterns against 11 different antibiotics. The
percentages of antibiotic resistance ranged from 13% to 78%, and
the MAR index varied from 0.09 to 0.91. Meanwhile, our results
showed that the amounts of bioﬁlm were generally related to the
speciﬁc isolates and incubation media. Although samples were
obtained from only one processing plant, the results provide useful
information regarding the extent of contamination by Salmonella
and serovars in raw chicken and their ability to persist in the pro-
cessing environment and resist antibiotics. This has signiﬁcant
implications for the food safety and public heath of consumers in
China or other countries which may import the product. Clearly,
further studies with additional
isolates originating from both
chicken meat products and infected humans need to be conducted
in order to reveal the epidemiological characteristics of Salmonella,
and the relationship between Salmonella isolates from chicken
meat and outbreaks of human salmonellosis.
