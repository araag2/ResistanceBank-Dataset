The aim of this study was to determine the genetic lineages, and the frequency of antibiotic resistance and virulence
determinants in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus
(MSSA) isolates recovered from milk of cows with clinical mastitis. Three hundred milk samples from bovine with
clinical mastitis were obtained from 30 dairy farms in different regions of Tunisia. Fifteen of the 300 tested samples
contained S. aureus (5%), in three cases were MRSA. Isolates (one/sample) were typed (S. aureus protein A [spa],
multilocus sequence typing and accessory gene regulator [agr]). The presence of resistance and virulence genes was
analyzed by PCR. The three MRSA isolates contained mecA and blaZ genes (one of them also the msr(A) gene), and
carried the enterotoxin gene sen; they were typed as t10381-ST4114 or t267-ST4120, and corresponded to agr type-
I. Twelve MSSA isolates were recovered and harbored the blaZ (7 strains) or erm(C) genes (1 strain). The MSSA
isolates presented seven different spa-types, associated to new sequence types (STs): t426-ST4118, t267-ST4120,
t1773-ST4115, t509-ST4119, t529-ST4117, t2844-ST4113, and t2802-ST4112; most isolates (8/12) were typed as
t267/ST4120. All S. aureus isolates were scn-negative, except one MSSA of lineage ST4119 that exhibited the
immune evasion cluster type D, and harbored the seg, sei, sem, seo, and seu enterotoxin genes. Four MSSA isolates
carried the toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 gene (tst). S. aureus (including MRSA) is an important cause of bovine
mastitis, showing isolates with high genetic diversity and high content in virulence genes.

Introduction

M ethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus

(MRSA) is one of main opportunistic pathogens at
the hospital level, and some speciﬁc lineages are emerging
in livestock animals and in related farmers. MRSA repre-
sent a signiﬁcant public health problem because it could
be transferred to humans through the food chain, and could
contaminate milk and dairy products causing foodborne ill-
ness.1 In addition, animals could carry S. aureus implicated in
zoonotic infections. Moreover, S. aureus is a well-known
etiological agent of bovine mastitis resulting in important
economic losses in dairy industry worldwide, due to reduced
milk production, milk discard, premature slaughter, and an-
tibiotic usage.2,3

The overuse of antimicrobial agents in human and vet-
erinary medicine could favor the emergence and dissemi-
nation of multidrug-resistant bacteria, including MRSA. S.
aureus and MRSA have been recovered from dairy cattle,
and also from bovine milk. Milk could be contaminated with
these microorganisms either by direct excretion from udders
with clinical staphylococcal mastitis, or by indirect con-
tamination from the environment. Indeed, these bacteria
could survive for several months during handling and con-
servation processing in bulk tank.4–6

Methicillin resistance in S. aureus is conferred by the ex-
pression of the mecA gene, which also causes resistance to
most b-lactams.7,8 b-Lactam resistance in S. aureus is an
important cause of treatment failure of human and animal
infections. The horizontal transfer of antimicrobial resistance

genes between livestock and human-associated isolates is an
increasing public health concern.9 MRSA strains were ﬁrst
reported in animals in 1972, causing bovine mammary in-
fections. Later, more MRSA strains were detected in farm
animals (such as cattle, pigs, or poultry) and the zoonotic risk
of transmission to humans was demonstrated.9 Due to this
zoonotic risk to humans from MRSA associated to food-
producing animals, it is important to assess the importance of
milk from bovine mastitis cases in the transmission of MRSA
in the animal–human interface.8 Moreover,
in
methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) has also increased
in recent years, as published reports have proven that MSSA
can also be implicated in important infections and may help
to explain the appearance and evolution of the different
MRSA lineages.3

interest

S. aureus isolates can contain a diversity of virulence
factors, being of special relevance the Panton-Valentine
leukocidin (PVL), the toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST)
and the staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE). These virulence
factors could have a role in skin and soft tissue infections in
humans or animals, and these could also be associated with
cases of severe pneumonia and food poisoning.10 The ex-
pression of virulence genes is under the control of a global
quorum-sensing regulator system, named agr (accessory
gene regulator).10 Bioﬁlm formation in S. aureus is due to
the expression of the intercellular adhesion gene A (icaA)
and it is considered as an important virulence factor in bo-
vine mastitis.11

To develop an effective control and treatment of bovine
mastitis, it is important to study the prevalence, genetic
diversity, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence of S. au-
reus that cause clinical mastitis. Currently, these types of
data are not available for bovine mastitis in Tunisia. Thus,
the goals of this study were to determine the genetic line-
ages, incidence of antibiotic resistance, and content in vir-
ulence determinants of S. aureus isolates from cows with
clinical mastitis in Tunisia.

Materials and Methods

Bovine milk sample collection

Three hundred milk samples were collected from cows
showing symptoms of clinical mastitis (one sample/cow).
Samples were obtained in 30 farms with intensive breeding
across different regions in North and South of Tunisia
during October 2013 to September 2014. The farms impli-
cated in the study were involved in the production of milk
for self-consumption, cheese production, and milk-bottling.
Each cow was clinically diagnosed for the appearance of
general clinical signs related to udder and teats and presence
of any gross abnormalities like ﬁbrosis,
inﬂammatory
swellings, pain, visible injury or lesion, atrophy of the tis-
sue, and teat blindness. The milk sample was observed for
changes regarding color, odor, and consistency. The pres-
ence of clots, ﬂakes, blood, and other consistent changes
were indicators of clinical mastitis along with udder and teat
morphological changes. A milk sample of one infected
quarter was obtained from the 300 tested mastitis cows by
veterinarians. Before taking the milk samples, teats were
washed thoroughly and dried. They were then sprayed with
70% ethanol, the ﬁrst few squirts of milk were discarded,
and 30 ml milk samples were collected in sterile tubes. The

milk samples were then transferred to the laboratory in
cooler and immediately processed. It is important to note
that the studied cows did not receive any antibiotic therapy.

Isolation and identiﬁcation of S. aureus isolates

An aliquot of 10 ml of each 30 ml milk sample was
streaked onto Oxacillin Resistance Screening Agar Base
medium (Oxoid) for MRSA recovery. In parallel, 1 ml of
milk sample was added in 9 ml to sterile saline solution for
serial dilutions, then they were seeded on Baird Parker
(Biolife) for S. aureus recovery. Plates were incubated at
37°C for 24–48 hours. Isolates with typical S. aureus mor-
phology were selected (one per sample) and identiﬁed by
classical biochemical methods [Gram staining, oxydase,
catalase, DNase, and ability to coagulate rabbit plasma (Bio-
Rad)].12 Molecular identiﬁcation was performed by species-
speciﬁc PCR ampliﬁcation of nuc gene.12 S. aureus ATCC
43300 was used as control strain.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Susceptibility to 15 antimicrobial agents was performed
using the disk-diffusion method in accordance with the Clin-
ical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommenda-
tions. Antimicrobial agents tested (charge in mg) were as
follows: penicillin (10), oxacillin (1), cefoxitin (30), kana-
mycin (30), gentamicin (10), tobramycin (10), tetracycline
(30), chloramphenicol (30),
trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazol
(1.25/23.75), erythromycin (15), clindamycin (2), cipro-
ﬂoxacin (5), vancomycin (30), and teicoplanin (30).13 Meth-
odology and guidelines for streptomycin (10 mg/disk) were as
recommended by the French Society for Microbiology (www
.sfm.asso.fr). Moreover, erythromycin-resistant strains were
tested for induction of clindamycin resistance, as described
previously.14

Detection of the mecA gene

The presence of the mecA gene was studied by PCR in all
oxacillin and/or cefoxitin-resistant isolates, as previously de-
scribed.12 S. aureus ATCC 43300 was used as control strain.

Molecular typing of S. aureus isolates

S. aureus protein A (spa)-Typing was performed in all
S. aureus isolates (n = 15). The polymorphic X region of spa
gene was ampliﬁed by PCR and sequences were analyzed
using Ridom Staph-Type software version 1.5.21 (Ridom
GmbH). It automatically detects spa repeats and assigns a
spa-type according to http://spaserver.ridom.de/. Identiﬁca-
tion of agr allele group (I–IV) was determined by PCR as
described earlier.15 Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST)
was performed for all S. aureus isolates, as described pre-
viously.16 The allelic proﬁle of each strain was obtained by
sequencing internal fragments of seven unlinked house-
keeping genes (carbamate kinase [arcC], shikimate dehy-
drogenase [aroE], glycerol kinase [glpF], guanylate kinase
[gmk], phosphate acetyl transferase [pta], triosephosphate
isomerase [tpi], and acetyl coenzyme A acetyltransferase
[yqiL]). Alleles of the seven genes deﬁned the allelic proﬁle,
which corresponded to a sequence type (ST), assigned by
the S. aureus MLST database (https://pubmlst.org/saureus).

Detection of antimicrobial

[blaZ,
erm(A), erm(B), erm(C), erm(T), msr(A), msr(B), mph(A),
mph(C), tet(K), tet(M), and tet(L)] was investigated in re-
sistant and intermediate isolates by speciﬁc PCRs.12 Positive
and negative controls from the collection of the University
of La Rioja were used in each PCR assay.

Detection of staphylococcal toxin genes
and bioﬁlm production

All isolates were tested by PCR for the presence of eight
genes coding for staphylococcal enterotoxins (sea, see, seg,
sei, sem, sen, seo, and seu), toxic shock syndrome toxin 1
(tst), leukocidin of Panton Valentine (PVL, lukF-lukS-PV),
and exfoliative ETA and ETB toxins (etA and etB).12 Fur-
thermore, the presence of genes coding for the formation of
bioﬁlm in human and bovine mammary gland S. aureus
infections contained in the ica operon (icaA, icaB) was
determined by PCR.11

Detection of the immune evasion gene cluster

All isolates were tested by PCR for the presence of ﬁve
genes (scn, chp, sak, sea, and sep) of the immune evasion
cluster (IEC) system. These genes are enclosed in the u3
bacteriophage and encode the IEC system, which helps
bacteria to survive in the human host by evading the innate
immune system. Detected alleles allowed the classiﬁcation
of seven IEC types (from A to G), as previously reported.17
The presence of all these genes were tested using primers
and conditions as previously described.17

Prevalence of S. aureus (MRSA and MSSA)

Isolates were collected from milk samples of cows with
symptoms of clinical mastitis across different regions in North
and South of Tunisia. Of the 300 samples tested, 83 milk
samples showed the growth of staphylococci and one isolate
per sample was further characterized. Fifteen of these 83
strains (18%) were identiﬁed as S. aureus since they presented
the ability to coagulate bovine plasma and were conﬁrmed by a
species-speciﬁc nuc PCR strategy. The S. aureus isolates were
recovered from 15 different cows of seven different farms.
Only three of these isolates were MRSA, recovered from cows
of two different farms (31 milk samples were tested in these
two MRSA-positive farms) (Table 1). MRSA isolates con-
tained the mecA gene, as evidenced by PCR.

Molecular typing of MRSA/MSSA isolates

The characteristics of S. aureus isolates in this study are

shown in Table 1.

Among MRSA, two different spa-types were detected: (1)
two strains were typed as t267 with a new ST4120; (2) one
strain showed a new spa-type and a new ST (t10381/
ST4114). All MRSA strains belonged to agr type-I.

The 12 MSSA isolates recovered in this study were typed
by MLST (one isolate of each spa-type), and seven different
spa-types were detected: t267/ST4120 (six isolates), and
t426/ST4118,
t529/ST4117,
t2844/ST4113, and t2802/ST4112 (one isolate, each one).
All STs detected revealed novel alleles or novel allele
combinations (Table 2).

Antimicrobial resistance of MRSA/MSSA isolates

Seven MSSA isolates showed penicillin resistance and
harbored the blaZ gene, one isolate was erythromycin-resistant
and harbored the erm(C) gene, and another isolate was
tetracycline-resistant but was negative for tet(M), tet(L), and
tet(K) genes. All three MRSA strains carried the mecA gene,
and the blaZ gene, and one of the isolates was erythromycin-
resistant and contained the msr(A) gene (Table 1). All MRSA
and MSSA isolates were susceptible to tobramycin, chloram-
phenicol, gentamicin, ciproﬂoxacin, clindamycin, kanamycin,
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin, and teicoplanin
(Table 1).

Virulence genes and IEC proﬁle MRSA/MSSA isolates

The presence of virulence genes in MRSA and MSSA
isolates is shown in Table 1. MRSA isolates were negative
for all tested toxin genes except for the enterotoxin sen gene,
which was detected in all of them. MRSA isolates were
negative for the genes of the IEC system. For MSSA isolates,
only one strain of lineage ST4119 was positive for scn, sak,
and sea genes and exhibited the human-associated IEC-type
D. Besides, this strain harbored a combination of ﬁve genes
encoding enterotoxins (seg, sei, sem, seo, and seu). Another
strain harbored the combination of four enterotoxins genes
(seg, sei, sem, and seu) was detected. The remaining 11
MSSA isolates were IEC-negative. Four MSSA isolates car-
ried the toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 gene (tst) (26.7%), and
none of them was lukF-lukS-PV, etA, or etB positive. MRSA
and MSSA isolates were negative for the intercellular adhe-
sion genes icaA and icaB.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, there are no published data
concerning MRSA from bovine mastitis in Tunisia, more-
over, this type of data are also scarce in other African
counties.18,19 S. aureus is an important etiological agent of
mastitis in cattle worldwide.4,8,20 Its presence in bovine
mastitis milk has been studied in Brazil, Poland, China, and
several other countries.1,21,22 In addition, the emergence and
spread of MRSA and MSSA is becoming a major animal
and public health problem.

In this study, a low percentage of milk samples from
clinical bovine mastitis carried S. aureus (5%). Other
staphylococcal strains, as coagulase-negative staphylococci,
were also detected in these samples (data not shown). The
mecA gene was found in three of these 15 S. aureus isolates

recovered (20%), representing 1% of total milk samples
tested. MRSA represents a public health threat since it can
be transmitted to farm workers and veterinarians after
contact with infected animals.23 It could be also accidentally
transmitted after consumption of contaminated milk.

MRSA was rarely detected as a causing agent of bovine
mastitis in several countries such as Finland (1.5%) and
Germany (4.4%)9,24 with similar prevalence to our study.
However, it was more frequently detected in Brazil (23%),
Turkey (17.5%), and China (47.6%)7,25,26; differences in
sample sizes, seasons, or geographical locations might ex-
plain these discrepancies. In Tunisia, few studies have
covered the prevalence of MRSA and MSSA in meat
products, healthy humans, or animals.12,27–29

b-Lactam antibiotics are widely used for the intramam-
mary treatment of bovine mastitis in Tunisia, which could
contribute to the dissemination of resistant strains for these
agents. In our study, 10 S. aureus isolates were penicillin-
resistant and harbored the blaZ gene. Furthermore, penicillin
resistance of S. aureus from bovine mastitis has been in-
creasingly reported throughout the world. The low frequency
of tetracycline (one strain) or erythromycin resistances [two
strains: one MSSA with erm(C), and one MRSA with
msr(A)] detected among our isolates, was in agreement with
previously published data from Poland.21 While, higher fre-
quency of resistance was reported in China and Iran with
erm(C) as predominant erythromycin resistance gene, and
tet(M) and tet(K) tetracycline-resistant genes.1,4 All MRSA
and MSSA isolates were fully susceptible to chlorampheni-
col, gentamicin, ciproﬂoxacin, clindamycin, tobramycin sul-
famethoxazole/trimethoprim, vancomycin, and teicoplanin.
Similar results were found in Poland,21 while other studies
reported a multi-resistance proﬁle for S. aureus isolated from
bovine mastitis milk.30 These low resistance rates of S. au-
reus in Tunisia compared to other countries could be ex-
plained by the low use of antibiotics. Similarly, in a recent
Tunisian study, the analysis of bovine milk of healthy animals
revealed low antimicrobial resistance among S. aureus iso-
lates, except for penicillin, and most isolates corresponded to
clonal complex 97 (CC97).31

The virulence gene tst, which encodes toxic shock syn-
drome toxin, was identiﬁed in four MSSA isolates (26.7%).
This super antigen has been suggested to enhance the persis-
tence of bovine intrammamary infection; however, their role
as virulence factor in bovine mastitis is still speculative.32,33
In this study genes encoding for enterotoxins, of rele-
vance in food safety, were identiﬁed. Indeed, six of our
strains (40%) harbored genes included into the egc operon

(seg-sei-sem,seu or seg-sei-sem-seo,seu or sen), but no strain
showed the complete operon (seg, sei, sem, sen, seu, and
seo). Similar data about the absence of one or more genes in
the egc cluster have been previously reported. Moreover,
other studies also reported that the distribution of the SE-
encoding genes might vary among S. aureus strains isolated
from bovine mastitis. Thus, the prevalence of SE encoding
genes may vary depending on the geographical location.34
The presence of isolates with genes encoding toxins in-
volved in human infections in the milk of cows with mastitis
might represent a potential risk for human health. In our
study, MSSA isolates harbored more virulence genes than
MRSA isolates. The lukF-lukS-PV, etA, and etB genes have
not been detected in S. aureus strains isolated from bovine
mastitis in previous studies.8

Interestingly, most of the MSSA isolates (11/12) and all
MRSA isolates of this study lacked the IEC system; only one
strain of lineage ST4119 carried the IEC gene cluster (type
D). The IEC system is a set of genes that allows evasion of
the human defenses that are associated with strains of human
origin. Its presence or absence in S. aureus strains isolated
from milk mastitis bovine is very important, since it gives us
information about the possible origin of the isolates (human
or animal origin).10 As expected, most of our MSSA/MRSA
isolates lacked the IEC human marker; we cannot exclude the
human origin of the MSSA strain IEC-positive.

In this study, molecular typing revealed a high diversity
of new genetic lineages among the S. aureus isolates in
MSSA and MRSA strains that cause bovine mastitis. Eight
new different STs were identiﬁed and they represented a
single and double locus variants of ST97, ST700, ST351,
ST124, or ST487 (Table 2). The spa-type t267 was the most
prevalent among our isolates, similar data were reported in a
previous report in India.35

Among MRSA, two strains were typed as t267 with a new
ST4120, and were isolated from two cows of the same farm;
the other MRSA strain, typed as t10381/ST4114, was ob-
tained from another farm. It is interesting to remark that six
MSSA isolates recovered from milk samples of mastitis
cows of four different farms, were also typed as t267-
ST4120; It appears that this speciﬁc clone, both as MRSA
and MSSA, is circulating in dairy farms causing bovine
mastitis in Northern Tunisia. CC ST4120 is a single locus
variant of ST124, included in CC5, being this CC frequently
detected in human infections.36 MSSA of lineages CC5-
ST5/-ST8/-ST15 and MRSA of lineages CC5-ST5/-ST8
appears to occur frequently in African hospital environ-
ments, with CC5 being the most prevalent CC for MSSA
and MRSA across Africa.36

In addition, three new STs detected in one MRSA (ST4114)
and two MSSA strains (ST4112/ST4113) represent single or
double locus variants of ST97 related to CC97. According to
a recent study, the lineage ST97 can evolve to various ST
through active locus mutation; in this sense, ST71 may have
originated from ST97, and both ST71 and ST97 belong to
CC97, which includes mainly strains of clinical and subclinical
bovine mastitis all over the world.37

In Tunisia, few reports have described the detection of S.
aureus in samples of non-human origins. For instance, in
healthy animals (such as sheep, donkey, pet) the CCs
identiﬁed from MRSA and MSSA isolates were CC1, CC6,
CC22, CC72, CC130, CC80, or CC522, among others.12,28

Moreover, MSSA isolates of CC97 have been previously
reported in healthy bovine milk in Tunisia.30

In relation with MRSA of human origin in Tunisia, the
lineage CC80 was mostly found among clinical isolates,
although other lineages have been also reported, as CC5,
CC8, or CC45, among others.38–41 Moreover, MRSA-ST80-
t203 has been detected in healthy humans.26

In this study, we found that similar to what was reported
previously, all our MRSA isolates belonged to agr-type
I.21,42 It has been previously found that S. aureus strains
belonging to agr group I have a greater ability of invading
epithelial cells and persistence in the mammary gland. This
suggests that agr-I containing strains might be more effec-
tive at causing clinical or subclinical mastitis than strains of
other groups.43

Conclusion

To conclude, we show that S. aureus, both MSSA and
MRSA, is a cause of bovine mastitis in Tunisian dairy
farms. These isolates were genetically diverse, with seven
new STs, and presented low resistance rates for most anti-
biotics, except b-lactams. Many MSSA isolates carried the
tst and/or enterotoxin genes that are responsible for toxic
shock syndrome and food poisoning. Our study gives im-
portant information to know the implication of S. aureus in
bovine mastitis at dairy farms in the analyzed region, which
is important for designing strategic plans for surveillance,
control, prevention, and treatment of staphylococcal masti-
tis. Our ﬁndings emphasize the risk of transmission of these
microorganisms to humans through direct contact with cows
or through the consumption of milk with mastitis and its
serious effects on food safety and public health.
