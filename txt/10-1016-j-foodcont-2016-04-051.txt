A total of 651 samples from broiler cecal samples, carcasses, carcass parts collected at the slaughterhouse
level in Sichuan Province of China were examined for the occurrence of Campylobacter jejuni and
Campylobacter coli. After conﬁrmed by species-speciﬁc multiplex PCR, the recovered isolates were
examined for resistance to antimicrobials using an agar dilution method and investigated for the mu-
tation of gyrA, tetO gene and V domain of 23S rRNA as well as the presence of class 1 integron and the
associated gene cassettes. In addition, the genotype relatedness of the isolates was determined by
pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) proﬁling. The prevalence of Campylobacter was 56.1% in cecal
samples, 31.0% in carcasses and 17.0% in carcass parts, respectively. Among them, C. jejuni accounted for
24.6% and C. coli occupied 20.0% of the samples. The strains of C. jejuni were most frequently resistant to
ciproﬂoxacin (88.1%), followed by resistance to tetracycline (79.4%) and levoﬂoxacin (78.1%). Most of the
C. coli isolates were resistant to ciproﬂoxacin (100%), tetracycline (98.5%), levoﬂoxacin (98.5%), clinda-
mycin (98.5%) and erythromycin (93.9%). Antimicrobial resistance proﬁling showed that 93.7% of cam-
pylobacters were multidrug resistant (MDR) strains. Moreover, class 1 integrons were detected in 98.6%
of MDR campylobacters, among which 98.7% were positive for C. jejuni and 98.5% for C. coli. Three kinds
of gene cassettes-associated amplicons were identiﬁed and the amplicons proﬁle of 1000e750e500
e250 bp was the predominant pattern linked to the aminoglycoside resistance gene of aadA2. The
presence of mutation in gyrA, tetO and 23S rRNA between C. jejuni and C. coli varied from 89.7% to 97.3%,
96.6% to 94.1%, and 95.0% to 96.7%, respectively. Finally, the results of PFGE indicated that, 33 PFGE
proﬁles were generated among 78 isolates of C. jejuni and the similarity level ranged from 42.1% to 99.1%.
By contrast, 15 PFGE patterns were produced among 68 C. coli isolates sharing a similarity level of 54.0%
e99.7%. Comparison of the PFGE and antimicrobial resistance proﬁles of the isolates reﬂected the high
genetic diversity of Campylobacter tested. A poor correlation among the antimicrobial resistance patterns,
resistance determinants and PFGE genotypes was observed in C. jejuni. Our study showed that there were
several points of cross-contamination during broiler slaughter, and a high diversity of PFGE types in the
Campylobacter isolates with high resistances to ciproﬂoxacin and tetracycline.

1. Introduction

Campylobacter species have been recognized as the most
frequently identiﬁed bacterial causes of human gastroenteritis in
many developed and developing countries (Iovine, 2013; Pepe
et al., 2009; Taboada, Clark, Sproston, & Carrillo, 2013). Although

X. Han et al. / Food Control 69 (2016) 160e170

mortality is low, morbidity imparted by post-infectious sequelae
such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, Reiter
syndrome/reactive
arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome is signiﬁcant (Humphrey,
O'Brien, & Madsen, 2007;
Iovine, 2013). The species most
commonly associated with human infection is Campylobacter jejuni
(80%e90%); followed by Campylobacter coli (5%e10%), but other
Campylobacter species can also cause human infection (Rowe &
Madden, 2014). Food animals, especially poultry, are the main
reservoirs of C. jejuni and C. coli (Rasschaert, Houf, Van Hende, & De
Zutter, 2006; Szczepanska et al., 2015).

Campylobacter cause little or no clinical diseases in poultry, but
poultry carcasses have been frequently contaminated in the
slaughterhouse due to the high prevalence of Campylobacter in the
intestinal tract of market-age poultry and can be transferred to
human via poultry carcasses (Ellerbroek, Lienau, & Klein, 2010; van
Gerwe, Bouma, Wagenaar, Jacobs-Reitsma, & Stegeman, 2010).
There are several identiﬁed sources of C. jejuni infection, such as
consumption of raw milk, untreated water, foods, direct contact
with pets and farm animals (Denis et al., 2009; Humphrey et al.,
2007). Different studies of risk factors, however, point to the
handling or consumption of chicken meat as the main source of
infection in humans (Humphrey et al., 2007; Sproston, Carrillo, &
Boulter-Bitzer, 2014). Widespread carcass contamination occurs
in the slaughterhouse by direct contact with intestinal content or
with dirty contact surfaces such as rubber ﬁngers, conveyor belts
and cutting tables (Melero, Juntunen, H€anninen, Jaime, & Rovira,
2012). Contaminated food and subsequent illness are a huge eco-
nomic burden, and processing control and prevention measures are
of great importance (PerezePerez & Kienesberger, 2013).

In recent years, there is an increasing trend of antimicrobial
resistance in Campylobacter isolates worldwide, especially multi-
drug resistant (MDR) strains within the food chain (Abdollahpour,
Zendehbad, Alipour, & Khayatzadeh, 2015; Ma, Wang, Shen,
Zhang, & Wu, 2014; Melero et al., 2012; Piccirillo, Dotto, Salata, &
Giacomelli, 2013; Wieczorek, Denis, Lynch, & Osek, 2013). Some
antimicrobials, such as quinolones and macrolides, have aroused
the highest concern because of their signiﬁcance in human medi-
cine. Most cases of campylobacteriosis are usually self-limiting and
do not require hospitalization. Antibiotic therapy is required,
however, when severe enteritis or complications are present, as
well as when very young or elderly patients and pregnant women
are infected (Ge, Wang, Sjolund-Karlsson, & McDermott, 2013). In
these cases, the macrolide erythromycin is usually the ﬁrst-choice
drug whereas ﬂuoroquinolones and, to a less extent, tetracycline
is alternative option (Allos, 2001). The indiscriminate use of anti-
biotics in animal husbandry and in the human population has
leaded to an increase in antibiotic-resistant infections, which rep-
resents a hazard to the effectiveness of antimicrobial treatment.
Thus, monitoring and obtaining information on Campylobacter
resistance is highly relevant to public health and the international
trade.

Among the resistance mechanisms of bacteria, integrons are
now considered as efﬁcient vehicles for the transfer of resistance
markers among unrelated bacterial populations, especially those
Gram-negative bacteria groups (van Essen-Zandbergen, Smith,
Veldman, & Mevius, 2007).
Integron structures are naturally
occurring gene expression systems that can capture and integrate
one or more gene cassettes and convert them into functionally
expressed genes. It is these gene cassettes that encode the resis-
tance determinants to several antimicrobial agents. To date, nine
classes of integrons have been described and class 1 integrons are
clinically signiﬁcant (O'Halloran, Lucey, Cryan, Buckley, & Fanning,
2004). Integron-like structures were reported in Campylobacter
isolates, suggesting that gene cassettes encoding antimicrobial
resistance may act as a possible vehicle for the dissemination of

resistance among Campylobacter spp (Ekkapobyotin, Padungtod, &
Chuanchuen, 2008; Lee et al., 2002; van Essen-Zandbergen et al.,
2007).

Horizontal transfer of gene cassettes together with any genetic
modiﬁcation of pre-existing genes through point mutation or some
other genetic event, are thought to be the main mechanisms
contributing to bacterial resistance (O'Halloran et al., 2004). For
Campylobacter spp., most variability of resistance is found among
ﬂuoroquinolone, macrolides and tetracycline resistance, and it is
important to examine the resistance determinants and their ge-
netic composition as well as the resistance to antimicrobials. This
might be very helpful to prevent the dissemination of resistance
and for understanding the relationships in antimicrobial resistance
between bacterial populations. In Campylobacter spp., the resis-
tance to tetracycline is primarily mediated by a ribosomal protec-
tion protein (tetO), which is transferred as plasmid-encoded gene
(Gibreel et al., 2004), or in the chromosome where it is not self-
mobile (Chopra & Roberts, 2001). For quinolones and macrolides,
resistance has mainly been associated with target modiﬁcation in
the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of the gyrA
gene (Bakeli et al., 2008; Zirnstein, YU, Swaminathan, & Angulo,
1999) or mutations at positions 2074 and 2075 (domain V) in the
rrn gene, which encodes for 23S rRNA (Alonso et al., 2005; Kurincic,
Botteldoorn, Herman, & Smole Mozina, 2007).

Tracing the sources and understanding the epidemiology of
Campylobacter infections is increasingly relying on molecular
typing (Taboada et al., 2013). Pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis
(PFGE) is a highly discriminatory technique which has been
extensively used for the molecular typing of Campylobacter spp.,
mainly for C. jejuni. However, compared with C. jejuni, far less
typing studies have been published on other Campylobacter spp.,
including C. coli. At the same time, important differences in expo-
sure were identiﬁed with human C. jejuni and C. coli infections
(Duarte et al., 2014; Ruiz-Castillo, Torres-Sanchez, & Aznar-Martín,
2014), suggesting that studies should be conducted at the species
level.

Some recent studies have reported Campylobacter contamina-
tion in chicken in European countries (Economou et al., 2015;
Guyard-Nicodeme et al., 2015; Torralbo et al., 2015). However,
from an extensive review of the international scientiﬁc literature,
few reports were found on the occurrence and antimicrobial
resistance of Campylobacter in chicken carcasses in China (Chen
et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2014). Moreover, it is still less-known for
the distribution of resistance determinants among Campylobacter
isolates in China. While there were several studies describing the
prevalence of C. jejuni and C. coli isolates from chickens, few have
investigated the genotypes of the isolates from slaughter (Ma et al.,
2014).

This study aims to determine the prevalence of Campylobacter
spp. in the processing of broiler slaughter, examine the resistance to
several antimicrobials and characterize the common mechanisms
of resistance to ﬂuoroquinolone, macrolide and tetracycline among
the isolates. In addition, PFGE was performed to explore the di-
versity and links of Campylobacter species within the slaughter
processing.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Collection of samples

The investigation was conducted at one slaughterhouse from
April 2012 to March 2013 in a vertically-integrated commercial
poultry production continuum in Sichuan Province, China, in which
more than 30 million broiler chickens were reared, slaughtered and
sold per year. A total of 451 broiler cecal samples (one from each

162

X. Han et al. / Food Control 69 (2016) 160e170

broiler), representing samples of broiler at the farm level, were
collected after evisceration. One hundred samples were collected
by aseptically swabbing on the surface of the carcasses at the
evisceration stage, and one hundred samples were sampled by
swabbing on the surface of the carcass parts at the cut-up stage.
Then the swabs were immediately put into 3 ml of selective Bolton
broth containing 5% of fresh sterile deﬁdrinated sheep blood. All of
the samples were transported to the laboratory on ice within 3 h of
collection and were analyzed as soon as possible.

2.2.

Isolation and identiﬁcation of Campylobacter

For each cecal sample or selective enrichment broth, a loopful of
fecal material was directly streaked onto modiﬁed Skirrow agar
plate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing 5% fresh sterile sheep
blood and Campylobacter supplement Ⅲ (Sigma), and then incu-
bated at 42 C in a microaerophilic (5%O2, 10%CO2 and 85%N2)
chamber for 48e72 h. One presumptive Campylobacter colony from
each selective agar plate was subcultured and identiﬁcation was
performed using standard microbiological and biochemical pro-
cedures including Gram staining, production of catalase, oxidase
according to ISO 10272-1:2006. The bacteria isolates that showed
typical growth on mCCDA, were gram negative, had corkscrew-like
darting motility, were oxidase positive and did not show growth at
41.5 ± 0.5 C in aerobic conditions or at 25 C in microaerobic
conditions, were considered as Campylobacter spp.

2.3. DNA extraction and multiplex PCR identiﬁcation

For each positive plate, up to three presumptive Campylobacter
colonies were selected for further identiﬁcation using multiplex
PCR (m-PCR). Campylobacter chromosomal DNA was extracted us-
ing a MiniBEST Bacteria Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Takara,
Japan). PCR were conducted with three sets of primers (Table 1)
speciﬁc for the simultaneous detection of the C. jejuni (the hipO
gene target), C. coli (ceuE gene) and Campylobacter-speciﬁc 16S
rRNA gene (positive control). The primers for identiﬁcation of hipO
gene in this work were designed by Oligo 6.0 software. PCR was
performed in a 25 mL mixture containing 2  PCR Mix 12.5 mL
(Takara), DNA template 1.0 mL and a ﬁnal concentration of 0.8 mmol/
L 16S rRNA primers, 0.4 mmol/L hipO primers and 0.2 mmol/L ceuE
primers. Ampliﬁcation reactions were carried out using a DNA
thermal cycler (C1000, Bio-rad, USA) with the following program:
one cycle of 10 min at 95 C, 30 cycles each consisting of 30 s at
95 C, 1 min and 30 s at 56 C, 1 min at 72 C and a ﬁnal extension
step of 10 min at 72 C. Reference strains of C. jejuni (ATCC 33560)
and C. coli (ATCC 33559) were used as positive controls and sterile
distilled water was used as no template control (NTC). The PCR
products were stained with 1% ethidium bromide and visualized
under UV light after gel electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gel. Where
isolates from the same sample, only one of the isolates that
belonged to the same species was selected for the subsequent
analysis. All conﬁrmed isolates were stored at  80 C in Brain Heart
Infusion (BHI) broth (Hangwei, Hangzhou, China) containing 20%
glycerol.

2.4. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by a stan-
dard agar dilution method in Muller-Hinton agar supplemented
with 5% sheep blood, as described by the Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI, 2010). The agar plates were incubated at
42 C for 24 h under a microaerophilic atmosphere. The following
antimicrobial agents were used: levoﬂoxacin (LEV), ciproﬂoxacin
(CIP), streptomycin (STR), gentamicin (GEN), ﬂorfenicol (FLO),
tetracycline (TET), clindamycin (CLI) and erythromycin (EM). All the
antimicrobial agents were obtained from China Institute of Veter-
inary Drug Control (Beijing, China). C. jejuni ATCC33560 was used as
the quality control organism.
The breakpoint value for erythromycin, ciproﬂoxacin, and
tetracycline used in this study was determined as 32 mg/mL, 4 mg/
mL and 16 mg/mL, respectively, according to Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI, 2010). For clindamycin, the susceptibility
breakpoint (MIC, 8 mg/L) of the National Antimicrobial Resistance
Monitoring System (NARMS) were used (http://www.cdc.gov/
narms/). Since there is no breakpoint criteria for gentamicin and
levoﬂoxacin for Campylobacter according to CLSI, the breakpoint
value for gentamicin and levoﬂoxacin used in this study was that
the MIC  16 mg/mL and 8 mg/mL for Enterobacteriaceae (CLSI, 2012).
The breakpoint value for streptomycin and ﬂorfenicol were set as
MIC  16 mg/mL and 32 mg/mL according to previous publications
(Sahin et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2014). Multidrug resistance was
deﬁned as
classes of
antimicrobials.

Integron analysis
A random collection (n ¼ 146) of MDR Campylobacter isolates
were investigated for the presence of class 1 integrons, genetic
elements associated with the dissemination of antimicrobial
resistance by PCR as described before (Table 2) (Ekkapobyotin et al.,
2008). Each isolate was analyzed for the presence of gene cassettes
associated with class 1 integron structures using a PCR assay
described by the reference with modiﬁcations (Levesque et al.,
2005). Generally, PCR assays were carried out in a ﬁnal volume of
25 mL using 2  long Taq PCR MasterMix kit (Takara, Japan) ac-
cording to the manufacturer's instructions in a C1000 Thermal
Cycler (Bio-Rad, USA).
Speciﬁc amplicons of gene cassettes fragments (n ¼ 20) were gel
puriﬁed using QIAQuick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany) and
submitted for DNA sequencing (Takara, Japan). Then the resulting
DNA sequences were compared with the GenBank Database using
the Blast algorithm available at the National Center for Biotech-
nology Information (NCBI) website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

2.6. Detection of tetO gene, analysis of mutations in 23S rRNA and
QRDRs of gyrA gene

PCR ampliﬁcation of tetO gene, 23S rRNA and the QRDRs of gyrA
gene were performed using the primers listed in Table 2. For the
ampliﬁcation of tetO gene, the PCR mixture was subjected to the

following thermal cycles: one cycle at 95 C for 5 min; 30 cycles of
95 C for 45s, 55 C for 45s, and extension at 72 C for 1 min; and a
ﬁnal extension at 72 C for 5min. For ampliﬁcation of 23S rRNA, the
PCR conditions were according to the reference (Alonso et al., 2005)
with modiﬁcations. The conserved forward primer 23SRNA-F was
used in conjunction with the reverse mutation primer ERY2075 to
detect A2075G mutation. In each reaction, an amplicon of 485bp
could be expected, when the isolate carried the corresponding
mutation. The annealing and extension conditions were changed to
55 C for 30s and 72 C for 45s. Meanwhile, a fragment from 23S
rRNA gene of C. jejuni and C. coli was used in this assay to generate a
697 bp amplicon for DNA sequencing. Finally, the ampliﬁed PCR
products were visualized by electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel
stained with ethidium bromide (2 mg/mL). In order to conﬁrm the
mutation associated with resistance, the PCR products of the 23S
rRNA were analyzed by DNA sequencing (Takara, Japan). Two C. coli
isolates and two C.
jejuni susceptible to erythromycin were
included as controls.

The detection of QRDR mutation was performed using mis-
matched ampliﬁcation mutation assay (MAMA) PCR described by
previous study (Zirnstein et al., 1999) with modiﬁcations. The PCR
system was as following, a conserved forward primer (gyrAF1) was
used in conjunction with the mutation primer (gyrAR1) to generate
a 265 bp PCR product that was a positive indication of the presence
of the Thr-86-Ile (ACA/ATA) mutation in the gyrA gene, and in
parallel with a conserved reverse primer (gyrAR2) to produce a
positive PCR control product of 368 bp with any Campylobacter gyrA
gene. PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation was at
95 C for 30s, 49 C for 30s, and 72 C for 30s. Ten-microliter ali-
quots of each product were loaded onto horizontal, 2.0%, 0.5 Tris-
borate-EDTA agarose gels and were stained with ethidium bro-
mide for analysis after electrophoresis. Furthermore, the 265bp-
sized DNA amplicons (n ¼ 10) were submitted for DNA sequencing
(Takara,
Japan) and the resulting DNA sequence data were
compared with the published DNA sequences of C. jejuni and C. coli
for gyrA corresponding area. Two C. coli isolates and two C. jejuni
susceptible to ciproﬂoxacin were included as controls.

buffer. Electrophoresis was performed in a CHEF-DR III system (Bio-
Rad Laboratories), with initial switch time of 6.76 s; ﬁnal switch
time of 38.35 s; 120angle; 6.0 V/cm gradient; at 14 C; running for
19 h. After electrophoresis, gels were stained in a 40 mg/mL solution
of ethidium bromide for 30 min and then washed with distilled
water. Gels'
images were visualized and captured with a UV
transilluminator (Gel Doc XR, Bio-Rad).

2.8. Statistical analysis

PFGE results were analyzed using the BioNumerics software
version 3.0 (Applied Maths), the banding patterns were clustered
using Dice coefﬁcients with a 1.0% band position tolerance and 1.0%
optimization. The unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic
averages (UPGMA) was used to cluster patterns. Isolates with less
than 85% similarity according to the dendrogram were clustered as
separate genotypes.

3. Results

3.1. Occurrence of Campylobacter species

Out of 651 samples from slaughter processing, 333 (51.2%) were
presumed as positive for Campylobacter spp. according to the
phenotype tests. The isolates were further conﬁrmed by m-PCR and
the results indicated that C. jejuni was the predominant species
(24.6%, n ¼ 160), followed by C. coli (20.0%, n ¼ 130). Eleven isolates
could not be differentiated further. A total of 253 Campylobacter
isolates were obtained from cecal samples, including 156 were
positive for C. jejuni and 87 for C. coli. In addition, there were 12
cecal samples which were simultaneously positive for both C. jejuni
and C. coli. For the 100 samples from carcasses surface after evis-
ceration, 31 (31%) samples were positive for Campylobacter spp.,
among which 4 and 26 were identiﬁed as C. jejuni or C. coli,
respectively (Table 3). Among 100 samples from carcass parts, 17
(17%) were identiﬁed as positive for C. coli, none was identiﬁed as
positive for C. jejuni.

2.7. PFGE typing

3.2. Antimicrobial susceptibility

Pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed to
generate genomic DNA ﬁngerprinting proﬁles of C. jejuni and C. coli
isolates using SmaI (Takara, Japan) according to the procedures
developed by the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC,
http://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/pathogens/campylobacter.html).
Meanwhile, Salmonella H9812 as the reference marker (digested

with 40 U of SmaI. Resulting restriction fragments of Campylobacter
isolates were separated by PFGE in 1% agarose gels with 0.5  TBE

The results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed on
the 160 C. jejuni and 130 C. coli isolates are presented in Table 4. For
C. jejuni, resistance to CIP was the most common ﬁnding (88.1%),
followed by resistance to TET (79.4%) and LEV (78.1%), to a less
extent to FLO (16.3%). As for C. coli, most of the isolates were
resistant to CIP (100%), followed by resistance to TET (98.5%), LEV
(98.5%), CLI (98.5%) and EM (93.9%); few strains were resistant to
STR (17.8%) and FLO (8.5%).

Overall, all of 290 Campylobacter isolates (100%) were resistant

were resistant to only one antimicrobial agent tested and 16 iso-
lates (5.5%) showed resistance to two antimicrobial agents. Multi-
drug resistance which was deﬁned as resistance to three or more
drugs was found in 272 strains (93.8%) of Campylobacter isolates
(Table 5). Moreover, 91.3% (146/160) of the C. jejuni isolates were
MDR strains, which were mainly resistant to 3e6 kinds of antimi-
crobial agents (12.64%, 13.95%, 97% and 9.30%, respectively). By
contrast, MDR strains occupied 99.2% (129/130) of the C. coli iso-
lates, which mainly showed resistance to 6 (32.23%) or 7 kinds
(7.97%) of drugs.

Consequently,

Totally 146 MDR Campylobacter isolates were screened for the
presence of class 1 integrons. As a result, class 1 integrons were
found in 144 isolates (98.6%) among which 98.7% (77/78) were
positive for C. jejuni and 98.5% (67/68) for C. coli isolates. Addi-
tionally, all the intl1-positive strains were assayed for the presence
of gene cassettes linked to class 1 integrons. The results indicated
that 3 kinds of gene cassettes-associated amplicons were gener-
ated.
of
1000e750e500e250 bp, which was the predominant pattern.
Besides, 3 isolates produced amplicons of 1000e750 bp, and 3
isolates produced an amplicon of 1000-bp (Table 6). Since the
average size of a bacterial coding sequence is at least 800 bp,
amplicons of 1.0 kb from 20 randomly selected isolates were pur-
sued with further investigation, on the basis that these were more
likely to contain a complete ORF corresponding to a potential gene.
As a result, nucleotide sequencing and BLAST searches with larger
ORF identiﬁed it as an aadA2-encoding aminoglycoside adenyl-
transferase associated with the aminoglycoside resistance.

was found in 96.6% (57/59) of C. jejuni and 94.1% (64/68) of C. coli
isolates, respectively.

3.5. Mutations within 23S rRNA

The conserved forward primer 23SRNA-F was used in conjunc-
tion with the reverse mutation primer ERY2075-R to detect the
A2075G mutation. An amplicon of 485 bp could be expected, when
the isolates carried the corresponding mutation. Otherwise, the
amplicon would not be acquired in wild-type strains because the
last base in the 30 end of 23SRNA-R primer was not matching efﬁ-
ciently with the corresponding position of wild-type strains. PCR
ampliﬁcation and nucleotide sequences analysis of 23S rRNA was
performed in erythromycin-resistant isolates to detect mutations
associated with resistance to macrolides, and the results indicated
that 96.4% of erythromycin-resistant strains possessed A2075G
mutation in the V domain of 23S rRNA sequences. The presences of
this mutation were detected in 95.0% of C. jejuni and in 96.7% of C.
coli, respectively. No such mutation was observed in 23S rRNA of
the erythromycin-sensitive control.

3.6. Mutations within the QRDR of gyrA gene

An examination of the gyrA DNA mutation in QRDR using MAMA
PCR is convenient for the determination of the presence or absence
of amino acid mutations in the QRDR. Isolates with the wild-type
amino acid 86 codon (ACA, ciproﬂoxacin susceptible) were not
ampliﬁed with the reverse mutation primer gyrAR1, whereas the
isolates with the mutated amino acid 86 codon (ATA, ciproﬂoxacin
resistant) generated a 265-bp PCR product with the gyrAR1 reverse
mutation primer and the gyrAF1 forward conserved primer
(Table 3). Conserved primers gyrAF1 and gyrAR2 generated a 368-
bp gyrA PCR product with DNA isolated from all of the isolates in
this study. Replacement of C256 with T leading to a Thr-86-Ile
substitution in gyrA was the most common mutation, 93.1% (135/
145) of ciproﬂoxacin-resistant Campylobacter isolates had a sub-
stitution at amino acid position 86 of the gyrA protein due to a
mutation of the DNA codon from ACA (threonine) to ATA (isoleu-
cine). Totally, 97.3% (71/73) of C. jejuni isolates and 89.7% (61/68) of
C. coli isolates possessed a Thr-86-Ile substitution in gyrA, however
mutation of Thr-86-Ile was not found in ciproﬂoxacin sensitive
Campylobcter strains. From DNA sequences analysis, 2 point mu-
tations in gyrA were also identiﬁed in some isolates, which i.e. T-
243-C and T-320-C were silent mutations.

3.7. PFGE patterns of Campylobacter isolates

A total of 78 C. jejuni and 68 C. coli isolates, representing isolates
of different origins, species, resistance patterns and resistance de-
terminants were selected for PFGE analysis after digestion by SmaI.
As a result, 33 PFGE proﬁles were generated among 78 isolates
of C. jejuni. The patterns consisted of 6e16 distinct fragments

restriction patterns of C. jejuni isolates, is shown in Fig. 1. The
similarity level of the C. jejuni isolates varied from 42.1% to 99.1%.
We could identify three large clusters at the similarity level above
50%. The ﬁrst cluster contained pattern 1 to 3 with 4 isolates, which
shared a similarity level of 56.1%. The second cluster was identiﬁed

with pattern 4 to 32 including 73 isolates, which occupied 93.6% of
the isolates; the similarity level among them was 58.4%. Lastly, the
third cluster was pattern 33 with only one isolates.

The C. jejuni isolates were grouped into 19 unique PFGE patterns
(PFGE patterns represented by a single strain) and 14 clusters (PFGE
pattern represented by multiple strains). Among 78 C. jejuni isolates
available, 74 isolates were recovered from cecal samples, only 4

isolates were from carcasses. High genotype diversity was pre-
sented among 74 isolates of C. jejuni from cecal samples, which
revealed that the isolates were from a variety of ﬂocks. On the other
hand, the isolates with identical genotypes may originate from
different sources, such as strains of 12-JF165 and 1e14 in pattern 15,
isolates in pattern 19 and 28, which indicated that strains may
circulate from feces to the carcasses or environment.

The most common one, pattern 25-CJ, was highlighted for 8
isolates showing different antimicrobial resistant types. Besides,
the 24-CJ PFGE proﬁle (7 isolates) was very similar to the ﬁrst one
(80.1% of similarity). Moreover, the third PFGE proﬁle (7-CJ) shared
by 7 isolates was clearly different from the two others. The analysis
of the relatedness of the C. jejuni strains showed a poor correlation
among PFGE proﬁles, antimicrobial resistance and determinant
patterns. Generally, isolates with the same genetic resistance pat-
terns belonged to different PFGE types and resistance patterns. On
the other hand, 2 strains of C. jejuni (12-JF161 and 12-JF187) with
identical genetic proﬁle displayed the same PFGE type and anti-
microbial resistance proﬁle.

In contrast to C. jejuni, 15 PFGE patterns were produced among
68 C. coli isolates sharing a similarity level of 54.0%e99.7%, and each
isolate yielded 7 to 14 distinct restriction fragments which varied
from 20.5 kb to 668.9 kb in size after SmaI digestion (Fig. 2). The C.
coli isolates were subdivided into 8 unique PFGE patterns and 7
clusters. Twenty six isolates from cecal samples generated 12 PFGE
patterns, 25 isolates from carcasses produced 8 PFGE types and 17
isolates from carcass parts were subdivided into 5 genotypes. It
seemed that the C. coli isolates were more closely related than the C.
jejuni isolates.

PFGE pattern of 4-CC dominated the proﬁles, which occupied
44.1% of the isolates, including 30 isolates recovered from cecal
samples (13 isolates), carcasses (12 isolates) and carcass parts (5
isolates). The majority of the isolates in pattern 4-CC showed an
identical resistance type. The second predominant proﬁle was
pattern 11-CC, which accounted for 12 isolates recovered from cecal
samples (1 isolates), carcasses (3 isolates) and carcass parts (8
isolates). All the isolates clustered in pattern 11 showed the same
resistance type and resistant determinants.

Compared with C. jejuni, there is a number of C. coli isolates
showing good relatedness among the PFGE pattern, the resistance
type and determinants, such as PFGE pattern 4-CC, 6-CC, 8-CC and
11-CC, which showed that C. coli isolates belonging to the same
genotype could be recovered from different origins. These results
may suggest that a C. coli clone circulates in the slaughter pro-
cessing, or that the SmaI is not discriminative enough for this strain.

4. Discussion

In the present study, the higher prevalence of C. jejuni in broiler
chickens is contrary to the earlier ﬁndings conducted in Shanghai of
China (Ma et al., 2014) and many reports from other countries
including Reunion Island, Grenada and Spain (Hariharan, Sharma,
Chikweto, Matthew, & DeAllie, 2009; Henry, Reichardt, Denis, &
Cardinale, 2011; Torralbo et al., 2015), where C. coli was reported
to be the predominant Campylobacter species in broiler chickens.
It was also found that Campylobacter strains were most
commonly resistant to ciproﬂoxacin (88.1% for C. jejuni and 100% for
C. coli), tetracycline (79.4% for C. jejuni and 98.5% for C. coli) and to a
less extent to levoﬂoxacin (78.1% for C. jejuni and 98.5% for C. coli).
There was an obvious difference in the resistance to erythromycin
between C. jejuni (14.3%) and C. coli (93.9%). Recent susceptibility
studies on Campylobacter from poultry performed in different
countries indicate substantial variation among countries. Relatively
high resistance rates in Campylobacter isolates from chicken were
reported from Spain (Torralbo et al., 2015) and Iran (Zendehbad,

Khayatzadeh, & Alipour, 2015); moderate rates were reported
from Greece (Economou et al., 2015) and Poland (Andrzejewska,
Szczepanska, Spica, & Klawe, 2015), whereas limited occurrence
of antimicrobial resistance among was reported from France
(Guyard-Nicodeme et al., 2015) and Grenada (Hariharan et al.,
2009). These differences on occurrences of antimicrobial resis-
tance maybe reﬂect the different national and regional policies on
the use of antimicrobial agents for food animals. Regarding China,
ﬂuoroquinolones, tetracyclines, macrolides and aminoglycosides
are widely adopted to treat and prevent bacterial diseases in
poultry, and the extensive and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials
in broiler production has resulted in the high prevalence of anti-
microbial resistance among Campylobacter species, which imposed
a selective pressure on the emergence and spread of resistant
Campylobacter isolates.

The 290 Campylobacter strains, among which all but two were
resistant to two or more antimicrobial agents, exhibited 52 kinds of
resistance patterns. Moreover, 272 of the 290 (93.8%) Campylo-
bacter isolates exhibited multi-drug resistance, higher than ﬁgures
reported from other countries, including Poland (Andrzejewska
et al., 2015), Iran (Dallal et al., 2010), Ethiopia (Kassa, Gebre-
Selassie, & Asrat, 2007) and France (Payot, Dridi, Laroche,
Federighi, & Magras, 2004). The majority (32.8%, 95/290) of the
strains were attributed to the resistance pattern of CIP-LEV-GEN-
TET-CLI-EM and to a lesser extent of CIP-LEV-TET-CLI (8.3%, 24/
290). Considering by species, multidrug resistance was more
prevalent among C. coli (99.2%) than C. jejuni (91.3%), consistent
with results reported by others (Ma et al., 2014). As a result, the
selective pressure will often lead to the development of corre-
sponding resistance determinants that facilitate evasion of the
inhibitory substances.

So far, little is known about the status of integrons and related
gene cassettes of broiler-originated Campylobacter in China as well
as the determinant markers responsible for resistance to ﬂuo-
roquinolone, tetracycline and erythromycin. In the present study,
we reported the investigation of a large random collection of MDR
Campylobacter for the presence of class 1 integrons. Consequently,
98.6% of the campylobacters possessed class 1 integrons, and 52.7%
(78/148) of the isolates were positive for the corresponding gene
cassettes. According to the results, three distinct amplicon proﬁles
were conﬁrmed and 1000bp-sized amplicons were investigated in
an attempt to identify any potential coding sequences. Seventy
eight isolates were associated with this particular amplicon which
were present in both C. jejuni (16.7%) and C. coli (83.3%) isolates.
Interestingly, this group predominantly consisted of C. coli species
(83.3%, 65/78) isolated from cecal samples and carcasses, which
attach an interpretation for the higher prevalence of MDR C. coli.
Characterization of the 1000bp amplicon in randomly selected
isolates (n ¼ 20) independently accounted for highly similar aadA2-
encoding gene cassettes from C. jejuni and C. coli. This ﬁnding
demonstrates that identical class 1 integron structures are present
in different members of the same genus, suggesting that genetic
exchange may have occurred in the gastrointestinal environment
and plays an important role in the horizontal dissemination of
antimicrobial resistance among the bacteria. Furthermore, the
presence of class 1 integrons in several Campylobacter isolates may
partly contribute to the high levels of resistance to streptomycin
and gentamycin.

The presence of tetO gene was detected in 94.6% (123/130) of
tetracycline-resistant Campylobacter isolates. The high occurrence
of tetO genes in these isolates represents a potential high tetracy-
cline resistance in Campylobacter isolates obtained from poultry in
China, because the tetO gene is the most commonly reported
determinant conferring resistance to tetracycline in the Campylo-
bacter genus, and in many previous study, this gene was detected in

all tetracycline-resistant Campylobacter spp. isolates (Perez-Boto,
Herrera-Leon, Garcia-Pena, Abad-Moreno, & Echeita, 2014; Qin
et al., 2011).

Macrolide resistance in Campylobacter spp. has been mostly
linked with C. coli isolates of swine origin (Qin et al., 2011). Poultry
isolates seem to be more susceptible to this family of antimicro-
bials, because macrolides are not so commonly used in antibiotic

treatment of broilers as in swine. In this study, only 14.3% of C. jejuni
isolates were resistant to erythromycin, however a relatively high
resistance was found among C. coli isolates, with a high resistance
level of 93.9%. Similar results were reported that C. coli showed a
signiﬁcantly higher resistance to erythromycin than C.
jejuni
(Duarte et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2014; Torralbo et al., 2015). This
phenomenon may suggest that C. coli was more robust than C. jejuni

under the selective pressure or imply a potential transmission of
drug resistance spreading across different hosts among C. coli iso-
lates in the natural environments.

The MAMA-PCR, providing a simple and rapid tool to screen for
Campylobacter isolates resistant to ﬂuoroquinolones, is proved to
have 100% agreement with MIC results and DNA sequence analysis
(Alonso et al., 2005; Zirnstein et al., 1999). As a result of this study,
93.1% of ciproﬂoxacin-resistant Campylobacter had a substitution at
amino acid position 86 of the gyrA protein due to a point mutation
of the DNA codon from ACA (threonine) to ATA (isoleucine). Totally,
97.3% (71/73) of C. jejuni isolates and 89.7% of C. coli isolates (61/68)
possessed a Thr-86-Ile substitution in gyrA, indicating that this
mutation is more prevalent in C. jejuni than in C. coli. However,
other ﬂuoroquinolone resistant strains showed absence of this kind
of mutation, which might be explained by other mechanisms
including decreased outer membrane permeability (K€ohler &
Pechere, 2000) and an efﬂux system (Hungaro et al., 2015;
Corcoran, Quinn, Cotter, & Fanning, 2005).

As one of the most discriminatory molecular epidemiological
tools available for bacterial ﬁngerprinting, PFGE proﬁles could
indicate the occurrence of cross-contamination events at the
slaughterhouse, where could enable the survival of different
Campylobacter strains. In the present study, we found Campylo-
bacter isolates on carcasses and/or carcass parts with identical
macrorestriction proﬁles like those detected in cecal samples. The
presence of several shared pulsotypes between cecal samples and
carcasses surfaces indicates that fecal contamination at slaughter
was frequent. For instance, the 4-CC and 11-CC pulsotype was
observed in all samples (cecal contents, carcasses and carcass parts)
originating from broilers reared in the same farm and slaughtered
on the same day.
It has been previously reported that
campylobacter-negative ﬂocks were contaminated with campylo-
bacters during transport and slaughter (Peyrat, Soumet, Maris, &
Sanders, 2008; Takahashi, Shahada, Chuma, & Okamoto, 2006).
For another, it could be possible that Campylobacter isolates on
carcasses and parts with identical genotypes like those detected in
cecal samples were farm-speciﬁc isolates as shown for housed
broiler ﬂocks in a previous study (Klein, Beckmann, Vollmer, &
Bartelt, 2007). Whereas, the isolates of C.
jejuni which were
mainly recovered from cecal samples and showed higher genetic
diversity among strains were not isolated in the cut-up stage, and
this may suggest that C. jejuni is much easier to enter the viable but
non-culturable (VBNC) state than C. coli under the stress conditions.
Campylobacter isolates with genotype patterns (6-CC, 7-CC)
other than those found in cecal samples could be an indication of
several contamination sources, e.g. strains from previously pro-
cessed ﬂocks, if they persist in the wet and hot atmosphere of the
slaughterhouse, contaminated carcasses of the examined chickens.
In addition, other authors have suggested that campylobacters
could be present in aerosols in different areas of the slaughter-
house, including hanging, defeathering, evisceration and chilling
(Melero et al., 2012). Furthermore, some strains are able to form
bioﬁlms in vitro (Gunther Iv & Chen, 2009), and some can survive
longer and resist inactivation by disinfectants in pre-existing bio-
ﬁlms formed by other microorganisms (Trachoo & Frank, 2002).

In conclusion, a relatively high level of contamination with
Campylobacter spp. was present in the slaughterhouse, thus the
maintenance of processing hygiene and regular microbiological
inspection of carcasses are essential to minimize the cross-
contamination. Besides, the antimicrobial resistance is common
among Campylobacter strains from broilers in China, which calls for
rational use of drugs and continued monitoring during the rearing
stage. It is also important to raise consumer's awareness of correct
handling and cooking of poultry meats to avoid cross contamina-
tion at home before consumption.
