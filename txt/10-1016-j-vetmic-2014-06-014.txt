Escherichia  coli  O157:H7  is  a  globally  important  foodborne  pathogen  and  has  been  mainly
associated  with  cattle  as  the  reservoir.  However,  accumulating  data  shows  the  importance
of  sheep  as  an  E.  coli  O157:H7  vehicle.  The  presence  of  E.  coli  O157/O157:H7  in  recto-anal
mucosal  swap  and  carcass  sponge  samples  of  100  sheep  brought  to  the  slaughterhouse  in
Kirikkale  were  analyzed  over  a  year.  Molecular  characteristics  (stx1,  stx2,  eaeA,  hly,  lpfA1-3,
espA,  eae-a1,  eae-a2,  eae-b,  eae-b1,  eae-b2,  eae-g1,  eae-g2/u,  stx1c,  stx1d,  stx2c,  stx2d,  stx2e,
stx2f,  stx2g,  blaampC,  tet(A),  tet(B),  tet(C),  tet(D),  tet(E),  tet(G),  sul1,  sul2,  ﬂoR,  cmlA,  strA,  strB
and  aadA)  of  79  isolates  were  determined  and  minimum  inhibitory  concentrations  of  20
different  antibiotics  were  investigated.  E.  coli  O157/O157:H7  was  found  in  18%  of  sheep
included  in  the  study  and  was  more  prevalent  in  yearlings  than  lambs  and  mature  sheep,
and  male  than  female  sheep,  though  none  of  the  categories  (season,  sex  or  age  range)  had
signiﬁcant  effect  on  prevalence.  Furthermore,  Shiga-toxigenic  E.  coli  (STEC)  O157:H7  was
determined  in  2%  and  8%  of  sheep  feces  and  carcasses,  respectively.  Additionally,  lpfA1-3
and  eae-g1  were  detected  in  all  isolates.  None  of  the  isolates  showed  resistance  against
investigated  antibiotics,  even  though  4  sorbitol  fermenting  E.  coli  O157  isolates  were
positive  for  tet(A),  sul1  and  aadA.  This  is  the  ﬁrst  study  in  Turkey  that  reveals  the  potential
public  health  risk  due  to  the  contamination  of  sheep  carcasses  with  potentially  highly
pathogenic  STEC  O157:H7  strains.

1.  Introduction

Escherichia  coli  O157:H7  has  emerged  as  the  major
etiological  agent  of  hemorrhagic  colitis  and  hemolytic
uremic  syndrome  worldwide,  following  an  outbreak  that
was  traced  back  to  undercooked  burgers.  While  cattle  have
been  associated  with  many  human  cases  and  are  seen  as
the  main  source  of  the  pathogen  (Ayaz  et  al.,  2014),
prevalence  in  other  healthy  ruminants  such  as  sheep
should  not  to  be  underestimated  as  carriage  rates  have
been  found  to  vary  between  0.4  and  40%  (Chapman  et  al.,
1997;  Kudva  et  al.,  1997;  Blanco  et  al.,  2003;  Ogden  et  al.,
2005).

As  it  covered  12.5%  of  the  total  2,080,000  tons  of  meat
production  in  2010,  meat  of  sheep  origin  has  an  important
portion  in  Turkey.  It  even  shows  higher  percentage  of
relative  production  than  the  2010  sheep  meat  production
leader  (7.9%,  UK)  of  30  EU  and  EFTA  countries  (Anon,  2013).
Being  one  of  the  major  meat  component  of  kebabs  and
meatballs,  sheep  meat  is  an  important  source  of  protein  in
Turkey,  however, 
reports  assessing  E.  coli  O157:H7
presence  in  sheep  have  been  very  limited  (Goncuoglu
et  al.,  2010)  and  seemingly  none  have  evaluated  the
prevalence  of  the  pathogen  on  sheep  carcasses.  National
reports  by  governmental  authorities  regarding  the  true
incidence  of  E.  coli  O157:H7  infections  in  Turkey  is  lacking
but  there  have  been  reports  of  sporadic  cases  of  E.  coli
O157:H7  infections  in  humans  associated  with  visits  to
Turkey  (Erdogan  et  al.,  2008),  however  the  sources  of  the
infections  could  not  be  determined.

in  sheep 

The  current  study  was  conducted  to  determine  the
presence  of  E.  coli  O157/O157:H7 
feces
and  sheep  carcasses  over  a  one-year  period  and  to
assess  the  effect  of  categories  such  as  season,  age
range  and  sex  on  the  prevalence  of  the  pathogen.
Additionally,  isolates  were  characterized  for  the  pres-
ence  of  major  virulence  genes  and  gene  variants,
susceptibility  toward  various  antibiotics  and  the  pres-
ence  of  some  most  prevalent  antimicrobial  resistance
genes  to  estimate  the  potential  risk  sheep  meat  presents
for  public  health.

2.  Materials  and  methods

2.1.  Sampling  design  and  sample  collection

A  total  of  100  Akkaraman  breed  sheep  brought  to  a
small-scale  slaughterhouse  in  Kirikkale  between  June
2012  and  May  2013,  over  a  year  period,  divided  in  50
animals 
for  each  cold  (November–April)  and  warm
(May–October)  season  were  included  in  the  sampling
(Table  1).  The  number  of  animals  included  in  random-
ized  sampling  was  achieved  by  a  sampling  of  at  least  50%
of  the  sheep  presented  to  slaughter  in  each  occasional
visit  in  the  corresponding  month  and  speciﬁcations  such
as;  age  range  (lamb  [L  <  6  months],  yearling  [Y  =  6–12
months]  and  mature  [O  >  12  months])  and  sex  (male  and
female)  of  sheep  were  recorded.  A  total  of  200  samples
(recto-anal  mucosal  swaps  [RAMS]  and  carcass  sponges
[CS]  from  each  sheep)  were  collected  from  100  sheep  (18
lambs  [9  males  and  9  females],  40  yearlings  [34  males
and  6  females]  and  42  mature  sheep  [30  males  and  12
females])  and  analyzed  for  the  presence  of  E.  coli  O157
by  immunomagnetic  separation  (IMS)  based  cultivation
technique.

RAMS  samples  were  obtained  by  cotton  swaps
following  bleeding  and  transferred  to  3  ml  Tryptone
Soya  Broth  (TSB,  Oxoid  CM0129,  Hampshire,  UK)  (Ayaz
et  al.,  2014).  CS  samples  were  taken  after  evisceration,
before  chilling  using  a  pre-moistened  (10  ml  buffered
peptone  water,  BD  Difco,  New  Jersey,  USA)  cellulose
sponge-stick  (3M,  SSL100,  Minnesota,  USA),  sampling  a
minimum  of  700  cm2 from  ﬂank,  brisket  and  breast  areas
of  each  carcass  sides  (100  cm2 each  area)  and  ventral  of
the  tail  by  horizontal,  vertical  and  diagonal  passes  with
pressure  (Anon,  2001).  All  RAMS  and  CS  samples  were
coded  with  same  number  for  each  sheep,  kept  in  an  ice
bag  and  analyzed  in  less  than  2  h.

2.2.  Isolation  of  E.  coli  O157

to 

Isolation  of  E.  coli  O157  was  performed  using  IMS  based
cultivation  technique  as  previously  described  (Ayaz  et  al.,
2014)  following  enrichment  of  RAMS  samples  in  3  ml  TSB
incubated  (Nu¨ ve
that  were  thoroughly  vortexed  and 
EN120,  Ankara,  Turkey)  at  37  8C  for  18  h  and  CS  samples
that  were  incubated  following  addition  of  90  ml  EC  broth
(Oxoid  CM0853)  supplemented  with  novobiocin  (20  mg/l;
Sigma  N-1628,  St.  Louis,  MO,  USA).  Enriched  cultures  were
subjected 
IMS  with  anti-E.  coli  O157  Dynabeads
(Invitrogen,  Dynal  AS,  Cat  no.  710-04,  Oslo,  Norway)  and
beads  were  plated  on  Ceﬁxime-Tellurite  (Oxoid  SR0172)
supplemented  Sorbitol  MacConkey  (Oxoid  CM0813)  agar
(CT-SMAC).  Following  incubation  at  37  8C  for  18  h,  up  to
ﬁve  suspected  colonies  were  re-streaked  on  CT-SMAC  for
ensuring  purity  and  tested  by  latex  agglutination  (E.  coli
Latex  Test,  Oxoid  DR0620)  for  the  presence  of  O157
antigen.  Latex  agglutination  positive  colonies  were  sub-
cultured  in  TSB  at  37  8C  for  18  h  and  stored  at   86  8C
(Thermo  Scientiﬁc,  Revco  Elite  Plus  2586-6-v,  USA)  in
cryovials  supplemented  with  20%  sterile  glycerol.

2.3.  PCR  analyses

For  veriﬁcation,  identiﬁcation,  and  virulence  gene  and
antimicrobial  resistance  gene  determination  of  E.  coli
O157/O157:H7 
isolates,  DNA  was  extracted  using  a
method  described  previously  (Goncuoglu  et  al.,  2010)
and  10  ml  of  these  extracts  were  used  as  template  for  PCR
ampliﬁcations  that  were  carried  out  with  Taq  DNA
polymerase  set  (Bioron  GmbH,  Ludwigshafen,  Germany)
using  a  thermal  cycler  (Eppendorf  mastercycler  gradient,

Strips,  Roseto  degli  Abruzzi,  Italy)  by  Epsilometer  test  (E-
Test)  on  Mueller-Hinton  agar  (MHA,  Oxoid  CM0337)
according  to  the  manufacturer.

Twenty-four  representative  isolates  (Table  2),  showing
the  exact  virulence  gene  distribution,  originating  either
from  RAMS  or  CS  samples  were  grown  overnight  at  37  8C,
diluted  to  0.5  McFarland  standard  and  spread  on  MHA  with
a  cotton  swap.  Following  the  placement  of  test  strips,
plates  were  incubation  at  37  8C  for  18  h,  inhibition  ellipses
were  recorded  and  breakpoints  were  interpreted  according
to  manufacturer’s  criteria.

Statistical  analysis  for  determination  of  effect  of  season
and  age  on  E.  coli  O157/O157:H7  prevalence  was
performed  using  Pearson  chi-square  while  the  effect  of
sex  on  prevalence  was  analyzed  using  Fischer  exact  test
(SPSS,  version  14.01).

3.  Results

3.1.  Occurrence  of  E.  coli  O157/O157:H7  in  sheep  at  slaughter

Out  of  100  sheep  that  were  brought  to  slaughter  over
a  year  period,  18  were  found  to  be  positive  for  E.  coli
O157  by  IMS  based  cultivation  technique.  E.  coli  O157
was  isolated  from  10%,  4%  and  4%  of  CS,  RAMS  and  both
CS  and  RAMS  samples  of  sheep,  respectively.  A  total  of
75  non-sorbitol  fermenting  (NSF)  E.  coli  O157  colonies
were 
from  14  CS  and  8  RAMS  samples.
Furthermore,  4  suspected  colonies  (4CA-C  and  5CA),
isolated  from  CS  samples  of  sheep  4  and  5,  showing
sorbitol  fermentation  (SF)  on  CT-SMAC  in  consecutive
puriﬁcation  re-streaks  were  as  well  positive  with  O157
latex  agglutination.

isolated 

In  all  79  (75  NSF  and  4  SF)  and  68  of  79  isolates  rfbEO157
and  ﬂiCh7 genes  were  detected,  respectively.  Thus,  68
(86.1%)  isolates  were  NSF  E.  coli  O157:H7  and  11  (7  NSF
and  4  SF)  (13.9%)  were  E.  coli  O157.  These  results
showed  that  6%  of  sheep  were  positive  for  E.  coli  O157
(NSF  from  4  sheep  and  SF  from  2  sheep)  whereas  12%
were  positive  for  E.  coli  O157:H7.

3.2.  Inﬂuence  of  season,  age  range  and  sex  on  sheep  E.  coli
O157/O157:H7  prevalence

Occurrence  of  E.  coli  O157/O157:H7  in  sheep  is  given  in
Table  2.  E.  coli  O157  was  detected  in  11  (22%)  and  7  (14%)  of
sheep  sampled  during  warm  and  cold  seasons,  respective-
ly.  When  RAMS  positivity  and  thus  the  carriage  of  E.  coli
O157  in  sheep  brought  to  slaughter  was  considered,  4  (8%)
sheep  were  found  positive  in  both  seasons  while  1  (2%)  and
4  (8%)  of  them  were  positive  for  E.  coli  O157:H7,  showing
non-signiﬁcant  differences,  respectively  (p  >  0.05).  When
CS  positivity  was  considered,  even  though  in  both  seasons
E.  coli  O157  was  detected  from  7  (14%)  of  the  sheep,  E.  coli
O157:H7  was  detected  from  4  (8%)  and  7  (14%)  of  the  sheep
carcasses  sampled,  respectively,  and  showed  a  non-
signiﬁcant  difference  (p  >  0.05).

Out  of  100  sampled  animals,  2  (11%)  of  18  lambs,  10
(25%)  of  40  yearlings  and  6  (14.2%)  of  42  mature  sheep
were  found  to  carry  E.  coli  O157  in  their  RAMS  and  CS
samples,  while  0  (0%),  6  (15%)  and  6  (14.3%)  were  positive
for  E.  coli  O157:H7,  respectively  (Table  2).  E.  coli  O157  was
not  detected  from  RAMS  samples  of  the  lambs  while  6
(15%)  of  the  yearlings  were  positive  for  E.  coli  O157,  3
(7.5%)  of  which  were  positive  for  E.  coli  O157:H7,  and  2
(4.8%)  of  mature  sheep  were  positive  for  E.  coli  O157:H7.
Presence  of  E.  coli  O157/O157:H7  in  neither  of  the  age
groups  showed  signiﬁcant  differences  (p  >  0.05).

E.  coli  O157  was  detected  in  13  (17.8%)  of  73  male
sheep;  5  (6.8%)  and  4  (5.5%)  of  which  were  detected  from
only  CS  or  RAMS  samples,  respectively,  while  in  remaining
4  (5.5%)  from  both  CS  and  RAMS  samples.  However,  4
(5.5%)  CS,  1  (1.4%)  RAMS  and  4  (5.5%)  of  the  CS  and  RAMS
samples  of  male  sheep  were  found  to  be  positive  for  E.  coli
O157:H7.  In  27  female  animals,  E.  coli  O157  was  detected
from  CS  samples  of  only  5  (18.5%)  animals  while  3  (11.1%)
of  them  were  E.  coli  O157:H7.  Sex  of  sheep  did  not  show  a
signiﬁcant  inﬂuence  on  E.  coli  O157/O157:H7  prevalence
(p  >  0.05).

3.3.  Virulence  gene  proﬁles  of  E.  coli  O157/O157:H7  isolated
from  sheep

Virulence  gene  proﬁles  of  79  E.  coli  O157  isolates
are  given  in  Table  2.  None  of  the  isolates  harbored  stx1
while  45  (57%)  of  the  68  E.  coli  O157:H7  isolates  were
positive  for  stx2 and  stx2c.  Furthermore,  all  isolates  were
lpfA1-3+ and  only  one  isolate  (4CA)  was  hly .  All  SF  E.  coli
O157  isolates  were 
lacking  the  espA  gene  while  the
remaining  isolates  were  espA+ and  all  eaeA+ isolates  (77/
79,  97.4%)  were  found  to  harbor  eae-g1  variant.  These
results  showed  that  8  (8%)  of  100  sheep  carcasses  were
contaminated  with 
(STEC)
O157:H7  and  only  2  sheep  taken  into  sampling  were
carrying  STEC  O157:H7  (Table  2).

3.4.  Phenotypic  and  genotypic  antibiotic  resistance  patterns
of  E.  coli  O157/O157:H7  isolates

Out  of  24  representative  E.  coli  O157/O157:H7  isolates,
only  4  STEC  O157:H7  isolates  (47RA,  47CA,  49CA  and
51CA)  showed  intermediate  resistance  against  cephalothin
while  no  other 
isolate  showed  phenotypic  resistance
against  investigated  antibiotics.  Out  of  14  tested  antibiotic
resistance  genes,  only  tet(A),  sul1  and  aadA  were  observed
in  SF  E.  coli  O157  isolates  (4CA,  4CB,  4CC  and  5CA)  (Table  2).

4.  Discussion

the  pathogen 

in  sheep  and  sheep-derived 

As  one  of  the  most  important  foodborne  pathogens
worldwide,  E.  coli  O157:H7  has  been  associated  with  many
human  cases  that  were  linked  to  the  asymptomatic  cattle
reservoir.  Even  though  cattle  have  been  recognized  as  the
primary  ruminant  carrier  of 
in  many
countries,  varying  carriage  rates  between  0.4  and  40%
were  previously  reported  in  sheep  (Chapman  et  al.,  1997;
Kudva  et  al.,  1997;  Blanco  et  al.,  2003;  Ogden  et  al.,  2005).
E.  coli  O157  was  detected  from  18%  of  100  sheep  that  were
brought  to  slaughter  over  a  year  in  this  study.  In  14%,
carcasses  were  contaminated  with  E.  coli  O157,  8%  being
STEC  O157:H7,  whereas  in  8%,  the  pathogen  was  detected
from  recto-anal  mucosa  and  only  2%  of  the  sheep  were
carrying  STEC  O157:H7.  Cattle  and  cattle  originating  meat
and  meat  products,  in  general,  had  been  the  primary  focus
of  E.  coli  O157/O157:H7  in  Turkey  (Ayaz  et  al.,  2014)  and
relatively  less  focus  have  been  given  to  E.  coli  O157/
O157:H7  presence 
food
products.  Since  this  is  the  ﬁrst  study  that  reports  E.  coli
O157/O157:H7  prevalence  of  sheep  carcasses  in  Turkey,  it
indicates  the  alarming  importance  of  sheep  and  sheep
meat  as  the  source  of  the  pathogen  for  the  public,  as
carcass  prevalence  was  found  much  higher  (14%)  than
previous  reports  from  US  (3.5%;  Kalchayanand  et  al.,  2007),
Ireland  (1.5%;  Lenahan  et  al.,  2007)  or  Australia  (0.2%;
Phillips  et  al.,  2013)  or  than  in  cattle  slaughtered  at
the  same  region  of  Turkey  (7.1%;  Ayaz  et  al.,  2014).
The  prevalence  of  sheep,  carrying  E.  coli  O157  was  also
higher  than  in  many  studies  reported  around  the  globe
(Heuvelink  et  al.,  1998;  Blanco  et  al.,  2003;  Ogden  et  al.,
2005;  Lenahan  et  al.,  2007),  as  well  as  from  countries  or
regions  showing  similarity 
in  the  season,  climate  or
geographical  location  (Battisti  et  al.,  2006;  Goncuoglu
et  al.,  2010).  Since  in  most  of  these  previous  works,  IMS-
based  isolation  was  used  for  detection  of  E.  coli  O157/
O157:H7,  these  differences  in  carcass  or  sheep  prevalence
might  have  resulted  from  discrepancies  in  contamination
levels  of  the  pastures,  hygienic  practices  and  slaughtering
processes  in  the  slaughterhouses,  as  well  as  the  age,  sex  or
sampling  season  of  the  sheep 
in  previous
investigations.  Furthermore,  it  is  important  to  point  out
that  even  though  the  prevalence  of  E.  coli  O157/O157:H7  in
pelt  or  ﬂeece  of  sheep  was  not  in  the  scope  of  this  study,
detection  of  higher  carcass  prevalence  compared 
to
sheep  prevalence  might 
indirectly  result  from  higher

included

Y.E.  Gencay  /  Veterinary  Microbiology  172  (2014)  590–595

investigate 

contamination  rates  of  these  parts,  as  previously  shown
(Lenahan  et  al.,  2007).  Additionally,  generally  used  manual
pelt  removal  by  the  butchers  rather  than  automatic  pelt
removal  technology  would  be  a  contributing  factor  in
transmission  of  bacteria  originating  from  pelts  to  car-
casses.  Either  way,  nearly  one  out  of  ten  sheep  carcasses
(8%)  were  contaminated  with  STEC  O157:H7  and  this
ﬁnding  directly  suggested  the  poor  technical  and  sanitary
conditions,  and  hygienic  precautions  at  the  slaughter-
house.  Hence,  improvement  of  these  factors  by  slaughter-
house  executives  and  control  of  its  implementation  by
governmental  authorities  will  have  utmost  importance  for
reduction  of  public  health  risk  that  results  from  E.  coli
O157/O157:H7  contaminated  sheep  meat.
Another  aim  of  this  study  was  to 

if
categories  such  as  season  or  sex,  and  age  range  of  sheep
have  an  inﬂuence  on  E.  coli  O157/O157:H7  prevalence.
Occurrence  of  E.  coli  O157:H7  in  cattle  is  known  to  be
higher 
in  summer  than  winter  (Ayaz  et  al.,  2014),
however  studies  speciﬁcally  investigating  this  phenom-
enon  have  been  rather 
limited  for  sheep,  and  non-
signiﬁcant  (Chapman  et  al.,  1997)  or  signiﬁcant  (Kudva
et  al.,  1997)  higher  prevalence  of  E.  coli  O157:H7  were
reported  in  the  summer  season.  No  differences  between
warm  and  cold  seasons  were  observed 
in  carcass
prevalence  (8%  vs.  8%)  or  sheep  carriage  rates  (14%  vs.
14%)  in  this  study,  which  might  have  resulted  from  the
relatively  few  number  of  sheep  sampled.  Higher  preva-
lence  of  E.  coli  O157  was  observed 
in  weaned  than
suckling  lambs  (Battisti  et  al.,  2006)  and  lambs  than
ewes  (Heuvelink  et  al.,  1998)  previously.  In  this  study
however,  E.  coli  O157  prevalence  was  non-signiﬁcantly
higher 
in  yearlings  (15%)  than  mature  sheep  (4.8%),
while  E.  coli  O157  was  not  detected  from  RAMS  samples
of  the  lambs  younger  than  6  months.  Further  work  is
needed  to  identify  if  this  difference  might  be  important
in  potential  public  health  risk  the  yearlings  possess,  as
husbandry  of  yearlings  is  one  of  the  most  preferred  and
economically  privileged  sheep  husbandry  style  for  the
farmers.  Inﬂuence  of  sex  on  E.  coli  O157  prevalence  of
cattle  is  controversial  (Ayaz  et  al.,  2014)  and  to  my
knowledge  none  of  the  previous  studies  have  evaluated
this  category  for  sheep.  Although  it  was  not  statistically
signiﬁcant  due  to  the  small  number  of  female  sheep
sampled  in  this  work,  prevalence  of  E.  coli  O157  was
higher  in  male  (10.9%)  compared  to  female  (0%)  sheep
and  further  work,  with  emphasis  on  likewise  numbers  of
sheep  for  each  sex,  is  needed  for  clariﬁcation  of  this
inﬂuence.

In  none  of  the  79  E.  coli  O157/O157:H7  isolates  was  the
stx1 gene  detected  in  accordance  with  some  previous  studies
(Battisti  et  al.,  2006)  while  contradicting  some  others
(Lenahan  et  al.,  2007).  However,  45  (57%)  of  the  isolates,
detected  from  8%  of  the  sheep  carcasses  and  2%  of  the  RAMS
samples,  were  harboring  stx2c,  suggesting  their  high
potential  to  lead  to  the  development  of  hemolytic  uremic
syndrome 
in  humans  (Friedrich  et  al.,  2002).  Studies
investigating  the  intimin  variants  in  E.  coli  O157/O157:H7
strains  from  sheep  origin  have  been  rather  limited,  but  in
accordance  (Blanco  et  al.,  2003),  all  of  the  eae+ isolates  were
harboring  eae-g1  variant  in  E.  coli  O157/O157:H7  isolates

and  all  eae-g1  variant  harboring  E.  coli  O157/O157:H7
isolates  were  positive  for  lpfA1-3  in  accordance  as  previously
shown  to  be  associated  (Torres  et  al.,  2009).  In  4  SF  E.  coli
O157  isolates  (4CA-C  and  5CA)  espA  gene  was  not  observed.
This  suggests  the  lack  of  potential  in  development  of
attaching  and  effacing  lesions  in  these  isolates  (McNally
et  al.,  2001),  however,  the  coincidence  of  SF  and  lack  of  espA
in  these  accidental  isolates  are  of  great  interest  and  needs
further  work.

None  of  the  isolates  showed  phenotypic  resistance
toward  any  of  the  investigated  antibiotics,  which  could  be
resulting  from  relatively  less  preferred  intensive  breeding
of  sheep  (Goncuoglu  et  al.,  2010).  It  is  clear  that  sheep
originating  E.  coli  O157/O157:H7  isolates  have  no  or  minor
potential  in  transfer  of  antibiotic  resistance  traits.

5.  Conclusion

improvement 

the  potential  public  health  risk  due  to 

In  conclusion,  being  the  ﬁrst  study  in  Turkey  that
reveals 
the
contamination  of  sheep  carcasses  with  potentially  highly
pathogenic  STEC  O157:H7  strains,  the  current  study  shows
the  urgent  need  of 
in  slaughterhouses’
hygienic  and  technological  requirements.  Since  a  high
carriage  rate  of  E.  coli  O157/O157:H7  was  also  found  in
sheep  brought  to  slaughter,  it  is  clear  that  the  use  of
unprocessed  sheep  feces  in  agriculture  and  gardening  as
fertilizers  pose  a  high  risk  for  public  health  and  thus,
thorough  hygienic  precautions  should  be  taken  following
contact  with  soil  fertilized  with  sheep  feces  or  pastures
where  sheep  graze.  Observation  of  higher  prevalence  of  E.
coli  O157/O157:H7 
is  an
important  ﬁnding  and  needs  further  investigation.  Al-
though  no  alarming  antibiotic  resistance  was  observed,
presence  of  intermediate  resistant  isolates  suggests  further
screening  of  this  trend.
