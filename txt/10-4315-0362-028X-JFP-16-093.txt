ABSTRACT

Food-producing animals can serve as reservoirs for extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL)–producing Escherichia coli. The
present study aimed to characterize and compare ESBL-carrying E. coli isolates from both pigs and farm workers. Rectal swabs
were obtained from 60 pigs on four pig-fattening farms (15 samples per farm), and rectal swabs were taken from 40 farm workers on
these farms (10 samples per farm). ESBL-carrying E. coli isolates from the workers and pigs were characterized by ESBL genotype,
antibiotic susceptibility, enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus type, and multilocus sequence type. ESBL-producing E. coli
was detected in 34 (56.7%) of 60 pigs, and 20.0% (8 of 40) of the farm workers were positive for ESBL-producing E. coli. More
importantly, ESBL-producing E. coli isolates with the same b-lactamase genes, antibiotic resistance proﬁles, enterobacterial
repetitive intergenic consensus types, and multilocus sequence types were detected in both pigs and workers on the same pig farm.
These ﬁndings were suggestive for transfer of ESBL-producing E. coli between animals and humans.

reports about extended-spectrum b-lactamase
However,
(ESBL)–producing bacteria isolated from both humans and
animals have become increasingly frequent (21). ESBLs are
mainly plasmid-encoded enzymes that can hydrolyze the
third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and can be
produced by a variety of bacteria, such as Escherichia coli
and Klebsiella pneumoniae,
the most commonly found
ESBL-producing bacteria (4, 10).

In recent years, ESBL-producing E. coli have frequently
been isolated from food-producing animals across the world
(3, 7, 8, 11, 16, 22, 30). In China, an increasing number of
ESBL-producing E. coli isolates have been recovered from
food-producing animals since 2005 (16, 22, 27, 30).
Therefore, food animals have been regarded as a potential
source for ESBL-producing E. coli and have attracted
considerable attention (23).

Of note, possible transmission of ESBL-producing E.
coli
from animal meat products to humans has been
suggested (13, 15, 20, 25, 26). ESBL-producing E. coli
can also be transmitted from live animals to humans (or vice

versa). Direct contact with live animals may be a potential
risk factor for human ESBL carriage (8). The present study
was therefore designed to characterize and compare ESBL-
producing E. coli isolates from both pigs and pig caretakers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Collection of rectal swab samples. During May to July
2015, on four pig-fattening farms (A, B, C, and D) in Shandong
Province, People’s Republic of China, rectal swab samples from
pigs and farm workers were obtained and immediately transported
into our laboratory for analysis within 6 h. Brieﬂy, on each farm,
rectal swabs from 15 pigs were randomly obtained by the farm
veterinarians with sterile swabs, and rectal swab samples from 10
farm workers were collected by themselves using sterile swabs
according to instructions by trained veterinarians. All participants
gave written informed consent. The study protocol was approved
by the Bio-medical Research Ethics Committee of Shandong
Agricultural University (no. 2015-5-16).

Isolation and conﬁrmation of ESBL-producing E. coli. All
rectal swab samples were spread on MacConkey agar plates with
added ceftriaxone (1 mg/liter) and were incubated at 378C for 24 h.
One presumptive colony with typical E. coli morphology was
selected from each rectal swab sample and was identiﬁed using the
API 20E system (bioM´erieux, Marcy-l’ ´Etoile, France). Suspected
ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were conﬁrmed by double-disk
synergy test using both cefotaxime and ceftazidime in the presence
or absence of clavulanic acid as recommended by the Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (5).

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The disk diffusion
method was used according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute guidelines (5) to carry out antimicrobial susceptibility
testing. A panel of 13 antimicrobial drugs was tested in this study,
including ampicillin, cephalothin, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, imipenem,
chloramphenicol, gentamicin, neomycin, streptomycin,
tetracy-
cline, ciproﬂoxacin, nalidixic acid, and trimethoprim-sulfamethox-
azole.
four selected antimicrobials
(cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, and imipenem), which are
important for the scientiﬁc community to know, were tested using
Etest strips (AB Biodisk), and the results were interpreted
according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
guidelines (5). E. coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
ATCC 27853 were used as quality control strains.

In addition,

Detection of b-lactamase gene. ESBL-producing E. coli
isolates were analyzed for the presence of genes encoding TEM,
SHV, and CTX-M b-lactamases by PCR as described previously
(Table 1) (1, 18, 30). The ampliﬁcation conditions included an
initial denaturation at 948C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 948C for 1 min,
56 or 578C (depending on the primers) for 1 min, and 728C for 1
min, with a ﬁnal extension at 728C for 7 min. The PCR products
were sequenced using an ABI 3730 automated sequencer (Base-
Clear, Leiden, The Netherlands). Forward and reverse sequences
were aligned with reference sequences in the BLAST database
(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to conﬁrm the b-lactamase
type (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/pathogens/submit_
beta_lactamase).

ERIC PCR. The genetic similarity of ESBL-producing E.
coli isolates from both pigs and farm workers was analyzed using
enterobacterial
repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)–based
primers for PCR, as previously described (Table 1) (17, 19). The
PCR protocol included an initial denaturation (3 min at 948C), 30
denaturation cycles (1 min at 948C), annealing (1 min at 508C),
chain extension (3 min at 728C), and a ﬁnal extension (5 min at
728C). The PCR products were separated in 2% agarose gels by
electrophoresis. NTSYSpc software (version 2.10) was used to
produce a dendrogram, and clustering analysis was performed by
the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages
according to the Dice similarity index (17).

MLST. Forty-two ESBL-producing E. coli isolates recovered
from both pigs and farm workers were subjected to multilocus
sequence type (MLST) analysis (8). Brieﬂy, MLST was carried out

using seven conserved housekeeping genes (adk, fumC, gyrB, icd,
mdh, purA, and recA) (http://mlst.warwick.ac.uk/mlst/).

RESULTS

ESBL-producing E. coli isolates from pigs and farm
workers. A total of 42 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates
were obtained in this study. Thirty-four ESBL-producing E.
coli isolates (34 of 60, 56.7%) were obtained from four pig
farms, including 10 isolates from farm A (10 of 15, 66.7%),
10 from farm B (10 of 15, 66.7%), 9 from farm C (9 of 15,
60.0%), and 5 from farm D (5 of 15, 33.3%). Eight ESBL-
producing E. coli
isolates were isolated from 40 farm
workers (8 of 40, 20.0%), including 3 workers from farm A
(3 of 10, 30.0%), 2 from B (2 of 10, 20.0%), 2 from C (2 of
10, 20.0%), and 1 from D (1 of 10, 10.0%) (Fig. 1).

Antimicrobial susceptibility. All 42 ESBL-producing
E. coli
isolates from both pigs and farm workers were
resistant to ampicillin, cephalothin, and cefotaxime. Fortu-
nately, these isolates were all susceptible to imipenem and
cefoxitin. Among the 34 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates
from pigs, most of
the isolates showed resistance to
gentamicin (30 of 34, 88.2%),
tetracycline (30 of 34,
88.2%), streptomycin (24 of 34, 70.6%), and trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole (24 of 34, 70.6%); moderate resistance
rates were observed for nalidixic acid (20 of 34, 58.8%),
chloramphenicol (18 of 34, 52.9%), and neomycin (14 of 34,
41.2%); and relatively low resistance rates were observed for
ciproﬂoxacin (7 of 34, 20.6%). Among the eight ESBL-
producing E. coli isolates from farm workers, high resistance
rates were observed for tetracycline (6 of 8, 75.0%) and
nalidixic acid (6 of 8, 75.0%); moderate resistance rates
were observed for gentamicin (4 of 8, 50.0%), neomycin (4
of 8, 50.0%), streptomycin (4 of 8, 50.0%), and trimetho-
prim-sulfamethoxazole (4 of 8, 50.0%); and relatively low
resistance rates were observed for chloramphenicol (3 of 8,
37.5%) and ciproﬂoxacin (3 of 8, 37.5%) (Fig. 1). The MIC
ranges for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, and imipenem
were 4 to 16 lg/ml, 0.5 to 32 lg/ml, 0.5 to 16 lg/ml, and
0.19 to 0.25 lg/ml, respectively.

Characterization of b-lactamase genes. All 42 ESBL-
producing E. coli isolates from both pigs and workers carried
blaCTX-M genes. However, no blaSHV genes were detected in
this study. Among the 34 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates
from pigs, the dominant blaCTX-M type was blaCTX-M-55 (11
of 34, 32.4%), followed by blaCTX-M-14 (10 of 34, 29.4%),
blaCTX-M-15 (7 of 34, 20.6%), and blaCTX-M-65 (5 of 34,
14.7%). Of note, 25 ESBL-producing E. coli
isolates
(73.5%) from pigs contained both blaCTX-M and blaTEM-1.
Among the eight ESBL-producing E. coli isolates from farm
workers, the dominant blaCTX-M type was blaCTX-M-14 (6 of

Additionally, six of
isolates (75.0%) from farm workers contained both blaCTX-M
and blaTEM-1 (Fig. 1).

ERIC and MLST. Thirteen different MLSTs were
detected in isolates from both farm workers and pigs.
Twenty-two of 42 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates belonged

to sequence type 10 (ST-10). More importantly, four sets of
ESBL-producing E. coli isolates from both farm workers
and pigs with the same b-lactamase genes and antibiotic
resistance proﬁles were identical in their MLSTs and ERIC
types. Speciﬁcally, at pig farm A, two farm worker isolates
and one pig isolate were identiﬁed as E. coli ST-10; at pig
farm B, one farm worker isolate and one pig isolate were
identiﬁed as E. coli ST-453; at pig farm C, one farm worker
isolate and one pig isolate were identiﬁed as E. coli ST-10;
and at pig farm D, one farm worker isolate and one pig
isolate were identiﬁed as E. coli ST-4056 (Fig. 1).

DISCUSSION

In this study, ESBL-producing E. coli isolates with the
same b-lactamase genes, antibiotic resistance proﬁles, ERIC
types, and MLSTs were detected in pigs and farm workers
on the same farms, indicating possible transfer of ESBL-
producing E. coli between pigs and farm workers. Results
from other studies are also suggestive for transmission of

ESBL-producing E. coli between animals and humans (8,
11). Additionally, the ERIC PCR results revealed genetic
heterogeneity of ESBL-producing E. coli isolates among the
different pig farms. However, a few clusters with high
similarity (90%) composed of isolates from different pig
farms were also detected. The isolates within these clusters
were subjected to MLST analysis, which conﬁrmed strain
relatedness in some but not all cases. Therefore, ERIC PCR
in combination with MLST can be considered as an
appropriate molecular method to analyze genetic relatedness
among ESBL-producing E. coli isolates.

All 42 isolates from both pigs and farm workers in our
study were resistant to three or more of the antibiotics tested,
which deﬁnes them as multidrug resistant. Of note, the 42
isolates were all resistant to ampicillin, cephalothin, and
cefotaxime. This result may be mainly associated with the
fact that ampicillin, cephalothin, and cefotaxime have been
frequently used in local human and animal clinical practices.
Fortunately, these isolates were all susceptible to imipenem
and cefoxitin.

Food-producing animals have been recognized as
(2). A
important carriers of ESBL-producing E. coli
connection between ESBL-producing E. coli
in food
production animals, chicken meat, and humans has been
suggested (14), and several studies revealed the presence of
community-associated ESBL-producing E. coli
infection
among healthy humans (9, 28). Thus,
the high rate of
isolation of ESBL-producing E. coli from pigs (56.7%)
found in this study is of great concern. Of note, extended-
spectrum cephalosporins, such as cephalothin and cefotax-
ime, have frequently been used on these pig farms, which
may contribute to the high rate of isolation of ESBL-
producing E. coli.

All 34 ESBL-producing E. coli

isolates from pigs
harbored bla genes, and blaCTX-M was the dominant ESBL
gene, which is similar to ﬁndings reported previously in
China (22, 29). Among the 34 ESBL-producing E. coli
isolates recovered from pigs, a high diversity of CTX-M
variants was observed. blaCTX-M-55 (32.4%) and blaCTX-M-14
(29.4%) were the most common genes detected that confer
resistance to cephalosporins,
in agreement with several
reports from China (22, 29). Additionally, blaCTX-M-15 and
blaCTX-M-65 were detected in ESBL-producing E. coli
isolates from pigs.

In the current study,

the isolation rate for ESBL-
producing E. coli in farm workers was 20.0%, higher than
the reported isolation rate of 7.0% in rural inhabitants in
Shandong Province, China (28). This result suggested that
frequent contact with animals carrying ESBL-producing E.
coli may be a risk factor for human carriage of ESBL.
Among the eight ESBL-producing E. coli isolates from farm
the dominant blaCTX-M type was blaCTX-M-14
workers,
(75.0%), followed by blaCTX-M-55 (25.0%). blaCTX-M-14 is
distributed in both human and animal ESBL-producing E.
coli isolates worldwide. In addition, several studies have
shown that blaCTX-M-55 in human ESBL-producing E. coli
isolates has become the second most common CTX-M
enzyme in China (12, 24).

In summary, food animals can become reservoirs for
ESBL-producing bacteria. Farm workers seem to have a

higher risk for carrying ESBLs than the general population
due to the fact that they have more chances to contact
animals carrying ESBL-producing bacteria.
