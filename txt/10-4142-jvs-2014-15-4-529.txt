This  study  was  conducted  to  determine  the  prevalence  of 
livestock-associated  methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus  aureus 
(LA-MRSA)  in  pigs,  farm  workers,  and  the  environment  in 
northern  Thailand,  and  to  assess  LA-MRSA 
isolate 
phenotypic characteristics. One hundred and four pig farms 
were randomly selected from the 21,152 in Chiang Mai and 
Lamphun  provinces  in  2012.  Nasal  and  skin  swab  samples 
were collected from pigs and farm workers. Environmental 
swabs (pig stable floor, faucet, and feeder) were also collected. 
MRSA  was  identified  by  conventional  bacterial  culture 
technique, with results confirmed by multiplex PCR and multi 
locus sequence typing (MLST). Herd prevalence of MRSA was 
9.61%  (10  of  104  farms).  Among  pigs,  workers,  and  farm 
environments,  prevalence  was  0.68%  (two  of  292  samples), 
2.53% (seven of 276 samples), and 1.28% (four of 312 samples), 
respectively.  Thirteen  MRSA  isolates  (seven  from  workers, 
four from environmental samples, and two from pigs) were 
identified  as  Staphylococcal  chromosomal  cassette  mec  IV 
sequences type 9. Antimicrobial sensitivity tests found 100% of 
the MRSA isolates resistant to clindamycin, oxytetracycline, and 
tetracycline,  while  100%  were  susceptible  to  cloxacillin  and 
vancomycin. All possessed a multidrug- resistant phenotype. 
This  is  the  first  evidence  of  an  LA-MRSA  interrelationship 
among pigs, workers, and the farm environment in Thailand.

Introduction

Staphylococcus (S.) aureus is an opportunistic bacterium 
and a part of the microflora in humans as well as various 
animals [27]. It frequently colonizes the anterior nares [30] 
and may cause infection when the host immune system 
becomes compromised. This microorganism has developed 
resistance to methicillin (i.e., methicillin-resistant S. aureus; 
MRSA) by acquiring the mecA gene that is part of a large 
mobile genetic element [26] as first reported in 2003 [19]. 
MRSA has become a pathogen of increasing importance in 
hospitals, the community, and livestock operations [10]. 
To date, livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) has been 
found  worldwide,  particularly  among  people  who  are 
involved with livestock farming [9,22,29]. These bacteria 
can  be  transmitted  to  humans  in  close  contact  with 
MRSA-colonized animals [23]. Livestock, especially pigs, 
can serve as reservoirs for LA-MRSA [15]. The prevalence 
of LA-MRSA among pigs, agriculture workers, and the 
environment  varies  according  to  geographic  area.  The 
majority  of  LA-MRSA  strains  belong  to  sequence  type 
(ST) 398 in Europe and America while ST9 is found in 
Asia  [6,7,18,20].  In  Thailand,  MRSA  has  been  isolated 
from  healthy  pigs  [1,14]  and  pork  [28].  However, 
LA-MRSA prevalence in livestock, especially among pigs

in  Thailand,  is  unknown.  The  goals  of  this  study  were 
therefore  to  determine  the  prevalence  of  MRSA  in  pig 
farms, farm workers, and the farm environment in northern 
Thailand  as  well  as  investigate  the  genotypic  and 
phenotypic characteristics of MRSA to evaluate potential 
relationships  between  humans,  animals,  and  the  farm 
environment.

Materials and Methods

Study design and study populations
This  cross-sectional  study  was  conducted  on  pigs, 
workers, and the environment of pig farms in Chiang Mai 
and  Lamphun  provinces  of  northern  Thailand  in  2012. 
Farm operations varied from large industrial facilities to 
small organizations. Target populations of the pig farms 
located in both provinces were from 21,152 farms based on 
a 2012 pig farm registry from the Department of Livestock 
Development,  Ministry  of  Agriculture  (Thailand).  The 
appropriate sample size was calculated for the pig farms 
with an expected prevalence of 20% [16], accepted error of 
10%, and 95% confidence interval using Win Episcope 2.0 
[25]. One hundred and five pig farms were determined to 
be needed, and proportional sampling was conducted with 
a 7：1 ratio of Chiang Mai farms (n = 18,508) to Lamphun 
farms (2,644). Finally, 62 and 53 pig farms from Chiang 
Mai and Lamphun provinces, respectively, were randomly 
selected for the investigation.

Sample and data collection
Demographic data for the farms and information about 
farm management practices including farm types, number 
of  pigs,  herd  size,  period  of  operation,  and  personnel 
protective equipment used by the workers were collected. 
Swab samples from pigs, workers, and the environment 
were also taken using the following protocols: 
Pigs:  At  each  farm,  groups  of  weaning  pigs,  fattening 
pigs, and sows were sampled if present. For each group, 
nasal and skin swabs were collected from five randomly 
selected pigs by a veterinarian. The nasal and skin samples 
were collected from both sides of the external nares and 
auxiliary regions using sterile cotton swabs (Oxoid, UK). 
Swab samples from each group of five pigs for each site 
(nasal and skin swabs) were pooled. 
Workers: Farm workers were invited to participate in the 
study if they had been employed by the farm for at least 1 
year. A maximum of two workers were recruited for each 
farm.  All  eligible  participants  were  asked  to  provide 
written informed consent. Samples from both sides of the 
participants’  external  nares  and  auxiliary  regions  were 
collected using sterile cotton swabs. 
Environment:  Environmental  samples  were  collected 
from  pig  stables.  Five  sites  including  the  stable  floor, 
faucet, and feeder were assayed using cotton swabs. 

All swab samples were stored separately in and stored in 
Stuart transport medium (Oxoid), kept cool in an ice box 
and transported to the central laboratory at Chiang Mai 
University, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine within 24 h for 
further analysis. 

MRSA isolation and identification
All  swab  samples  were  incubated  for  48  h  at  37oC  in 
pre-enrichment media containing tryptic soy broth (Oxoid) 
with 10 mL of 10% NaCl. Next, the samples were streaked 
onto  mannitol  salt  agar  (Merck,  USA)  with  6  mg/L  of 
oxacillin (Oxoid) and incubated at 37oC for 24 h. Three 
single colonies suspected to be S. aureus derived from each 
sample were selected and identified by Gram staining with 
Gram-positive cocci and catalase activity. 
The colonies were re-streaked onto tryptic soy agar plates 
(Oxoid) and incubated at 37oC for 24 h. A coagulase test 
was  carried  out,  and  the  presumptive  positive  samples 
were  further  screened  for  methicillin  resistance  by  disc 
diffusion with 1 μg oxacillin (diameter of the inhibition 
zone  for  MRSA  must  be  less  than  10  mm.)  [4]. 
Identification of MRSA isolates was further confirmed by 
multiplex  PCR  specific  for  the  mecA  gene.  All  MRSA 
isolates were kept in brain-heart infusion broth (Oxoid) 
with 15% glycerol at 󰠏70oC and sent for molecular testing 
at central laboratory at Chiang Mai University, Faculty of 
Veterinary Medicine. 

Molecular analyses
Staphylococcal  cassette  chromosome  mec  (SCCmec) 
typing:  The  type  of  the  SCCmec  gene  complex  in  the 
isolates  was  determined  using  a  previously  described 
multiplex PCR method. Bacterial cultures were sedimented 
and transferred in 200 μL of Chelex 100 buffer (Bio-Rad 
Laboratories,  USA).  DNA  was  extracted  by  boiling 
bacterial suspensions [5]. Multiplex PCR was applied to 
test for mecA detection and to classify the SCCmec type 
and subtype followed by Zhang et al. [32].  DNA master 
mixed (50 μL total volume) contained 0.5 μL of DNA, 50 
mM MgCl2, 5 μL of 10× buffer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1.0 U Taq 
DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and 0.2 
μM  primers.  Amplification  (PTC  200  Thermal  Cycler; 
Bio-Rad Laboratories) was carried out as follows: 94oC for 
5 min; followed by 10 cycles of 94oC for 45 sec, 65oC for 
45 sec and 72oC for 90 sec; followed by 25 cycles of 94oC 
for 45 sec, 55oC for 45 sec and 72oC for 90 sec; followed by 
a  final  heating  at  72oC  for  10  min.  Amplicons  were 
visualized under UV light in 2% agarose gel-electrophoresis, 
which  ethidium  bromide  stained  (Geldoc  200;  Bio-Rad 
Laboratories). 
Multi  locus  sequence  typing  (MLST):  MLST  analysis 
was performed according to a method previously described 
by  Enright  et  al.  [8].  Amplification  analyses  of  seven 
housekeeping genes (arc, aro, glp, gmk, pta, tpi, and yqi) 

were performed following the S. aureus MLST website. 
The PCR products were purified and sequenced according 
to the manufacturer’s protocol (Bio Basic Canada, Canada). 
Allelic profiles and sequence types of the MRSA isolates 
were identified using the S. aureus MLST database. Finally, 
phylogenetic  tree  of  isolates  tested  was  generated  and 
compared with 68 MRSA isolates from Thailand provided 
by  the S. aureus  MLST  website  using  Bionumerics  3.5 
with character data module (Applied Maths NV, Belgium).

Antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST)
An  AST  was  performed  using  the  Kirby-Bauer  disc 
diffusion  method  according  to  the  guidelines  of  the 
Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards  Institute  (CLSI)  [4] 
with  a  24-h  incubation  period  at  35oC.  Discs  with  the 
following compounds were used: amoxicillin-clavulanic 
acid, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cephazolin, chloramphenicol, 
clindamycin, penicillin, cloxacillin, doxycycline, gentamycin, 
oxytetracycline,  sulfa-trimethoprim,  tetracycline,  and 
vancomycin (Oxoid). 

Data analyses
Data management and analyses were performed using Win 
Episcope  2.0  [25].  The  farm  was  the  unit  of  analysis. 
Descriptive statistics including the proportion, mean, median, 
prevalence ratio, and 95% confidence interval were calculated. 
A  farm  was  considered  to  be  MRSA-positive  if  MRSA

isolates were found in at least one swab sample (from pigs, 
workers, or the environment) from that farm.

Results

In total, 880 samples from 104 farms were processed in 
this study. One farm was excluded because the business 
had closed. Out of the 208 workers from the study farms, 
138 were recruited for the study because they had more 
than 1 year of experience on the farm.
Information pertaining to the isolation and identification of 
S.  aureus,  methicillin-sensitive  S.  aureus  (MSSA),  and 
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is shown in Table 
1.  Thirteen  MRSA  isolates  were  collected.  The  MRSA 
prevalence  was  0.68%  among  pigs  (two  out  of  292 
samples),  2.53%  among  workers  (seven  out  of  276 
samples), and 1.28% in the environment (four out of 312 
samples). Herd prevalence of LA-MRSA was 9.61% (10 
out  of  104  farms).  There  was  one  farm  in  Chiang  Mai 
where LA-MRSA was isolated from both a pig and the 
environment (Table 2). 
Molecular  typing  was  performed  for  the  13  MRSA 
isolates.  All  isolates  belonged  to  ST9  (alleic  profile: 
3-4-1-1-1-1-10) and carried the SCCmec IV gene complex 
(Fig. 1). A phylogenetic tree containing the 13 ST9 MRSA 
isolates from the pigs, workers, and environment recovered 
in this study along with 68 submitted isolates from previous

studies in Thailand was generated by the computer software. 
These findings are presented in Fig. 2.
The  13  MRSA  isolates  were  tested  for  antimicrobial 
susceptibility. Sources of the isolates were from pigs (two 
isolates), workers (seven isolates), and the farm environment 
(four isolates). Susceptibility testing revealed that 100% of 
the isolates were resistant to clindamycin, oxytetracycline, 
tetracycline, and penicillin. No resistance to cloxacillin or 
vancomycin was observed (Fig. 3). There were 11 different 
patterns of antimicrobial resistance among the pig, worker, 
and farm environment isolates (Table 2). All were resistant 
to  at  least  five  antimicrobial  agents  (Fig.  4).  One  was 
resistant  to  12  antimicrobial  drugs  (environment  isolate 
AMC-C-CN-CRO-DA-DO-FOX-KZ-OT-P-SXT-TE).

Discussion

Findings  from  this  study  represent  basic  information 
regarding  the  burden  of  MRSA  associated  with  pig 
industries. The herd prevalence of LA-MRSA among pig 
farms in northern Thailand was 9.61%. This figure is quite 
similar  to  one  reported  in  a  previous  study  (10.0%) 
conducted  in  the  same  region  [15]  but  lower than  rates 
found in other countries between 2008 and 2013 including 
22.7% in Korea [16], 26% in Canada [13], 36% in the USA 
[22], 39% in the Netherlands [7], and 49% in Germany 
[24]. However, prevalence can vary depending on many 
factors including geographical region, sampling methods, 
laboratory testing methods [3], and age of the pigs tested

[13]. The large size of commercial farms in the USA and 
European countries may facilitate more opportunities for 
pathogen transfer and higher prevalence of MRSA compared 
to the smaller farms in Thailand evaluated in the present 
study.

Mai and Lamphun (Thailand) with 68 MRSA isolates from Thailand over the S. aureus multi locus sequence typing website. ST: 
sequence type.

MRSA  colonization  among  pig  workers  in  northern 
Thailand was low (2.53%) compared to rates found among 
pig  workers  in  Europe  [17]  and  the  USA  [13].  MRSA 
prevalence for at-risk populations including slaughterhouse 
workers and veterinarians in Europe was found to range 
between 3% and 12.5% [12,26,31]. Our results revealed 
that pig workers in northern Thailand are at a lower risk of 

MRSA colonization than employees from other countries, 
perhaps because of the prevalence of MRSA among pigs is 
lower. 
The prevalence of MRSA isolated from the environment 
in  this  study  was  1.28%,  which  was  lower  than  the  rate 
(17.3%) previously reported in the USA [10]. Staphylococci 
in the farming environment could serve as a source for

MRSA generation as this microorganism is easily detected 
in  both  pigs  and  the  environment  [11].  We  found  that 
MRSA-positive  samples  were  simultaneously  collected 
from  both  pigs  and  the  environment  on  only  one  farm. 
MRSA-positive samples from both pigs and workers were 
not simultaneously collected at any of the farms. 
Our study revealed that all LA-MRSA isolates were ST9 
with the SCCmec IV gene complex. ST9 represents the 
most common sequence type in Asia [5,14,18], and is a 
dominant clone among pig and pig-related workers [2]. 
Recent reports indicate that colonization by MRSA ST9 
with different SCCmec types occurs in pigs and pork from 
the northern and central regions of Thailand [1,14,28]. As 
shown  in  Fig.  2,  the  sequence  type  was  similar  among 
isolates from workers and the environment, which suggests 
that  MRSA  ST9  was  circulating  among  workers  and 
through the environment. 
MRSA is a human bacterial pathogen that has emerged as 
a major threat in hospitals (as a nosocomial infection) and 
the cause of community-acquired infection among high-risk 
groups such as slaughterhouse workers [10]. The use of 
antibiotics  in  livestock  production  has  promoted  the 
development of multi-drug resistance. In the current study, 
various resistance phenotypes of the MRSA isolates from 
farm  workers  and  the  environment  were  observed  with 
combined resistance to clindamycin, cefoxitin, tetracycline, 
penicillin,  and  sulfa-trimethoprim.  Similar  patterns  of 
MRSA resistance to clindamycin, cefoxitin, tetracycline, 
and ciprofloxacin were found in other studies of MRSA 
ST9 from China [6]. These antibiotics are commonly used in 
both human medicine and food animal health management.

animals  is  emerging  as  a  public  health  concern  due  to 
increased  incidence  of  community-associated  antibiotic- 
resistant infection [21]. 
To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to 
demonstrate  the  prevalence  of  LA-MRSA  among  pigs, 
farm workers, and the environment in Thailand. Continuous 
efforts to monitor MRSA in on the farms and among these 
populations are required to detect epidemiological changes 
and implement effective control measures to protect livestock 
and human health. Further investigations in different areas 
in  Thailand,  such  as  the  central  or  eastern  part  of  the 
country where the largest pig populations reside, should 
also be performed. 
One limitation of the present study was that the sampling 
method did not include the use a stratified sampling technique 
to study a specific production system. Additionally, the study 
was somewhat underpowered because the observed MRSA 
prevalence was lower than the expected MRSA prevalence 
used for sample size calculations. Moreover, only one farm 
out of 104 had MRSA-positive samples from pigs. Alternative 
techniques for isolating and detecting MRSA should be 
considered. Other works have indicated that the prevalence 
of  MRSA  among  pigs  in  Thailand  might  be  quite  high 
given  that  a  small number  of  samples  have been  tested 
[1,14,27]. 
In conclusion, our study is the first to determine MRSA 
prevalence among pigs, farm workers, and the environment 
in Thailand. The prevalence of MRSA was low among pig 
farms in northern Thailand compared to rates reported in 
other countries. Isolates from the workers and environment 
were identified as sequences type 9 with Staphylococcal 
chromosomal cassette mec IV (ST9 SCCmec IV). In addition, 
multi-drug  resistant  MRSA  isolates  were  observed. 
Continued efforts are required to monitor MRSA among 
at-risk populations including livestock and slaughterhouse 
workers to detect changes in epidemiology and implement 

effective control measures.
