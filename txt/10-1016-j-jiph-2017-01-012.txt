This   study   focused   on  77  isolates   of   Salmonella   enterica   serotype   Enteritidis   collected   during   2009   to   2013
from   healthy   and  sick   chickens   and   environmental   farm   samples   in   Tunisia.   Resistance   to  14  antimicro-
bials   and   the   encoding   genes   were   analyzed.   66,   26,   6.5,  3.9   and   1.3%   were   pan-susceptible   or   showed
resistance   to  nalidixic   acid   (Asp87   to  Tyr   and   Asp87   to   Asn   substitutions   in   GyrA),   ampicillin   (blaTEM-1-like
and   blaSHV),   sulfonamides   (sul1and   sul3)   and   streptomycin   (strB),   respectively.   A   single   isolate   with   inter-
mediate   susceptibility   to  ciproﬂoxacin   was   positive   for  qnrB,   whereas   qnrA,   qnrS   or   aac(6(cid:3))-Ib-cr   were   not
detected.   The   virulotype   of   the   isolates   was   established   by   testing   ten   virulence   genes.   The   orgA,   ssaQ,
mgtC,   siiD,   sopB   genes,   located   on  Salmonella   pathogenicity   islands,   and   spvC   of   the  serotype-speciﬁc
virulence   plasmid,   were   common   to  all   isolates.   In   contrast,   the   prophage-associated   sopE-1,   sodC1   and
gipA  genes   and   the   ﬁmbrial   bcfC   gene   were   variably   represented.   All   isolates   except   one   contained   the
virulence   plasmid,   which   appeared   either   alone   or   together   with   one   or   more   additional   plasmids.   One
isolate   carried   a   single   plasmid   of   ca.   90   Kb   which   may   be   derived   from   the   virulence   plasmid   (60   Kb).
Overall,   seven   resistotypes,   six   virulotypes   and   six  plasmid   proﬁles   were   identiﬁed.   XbaI-PFGE   revealed
four   related   pulsotypes   (X1–X4),   with  80%   of  the   isolates   sharing   the   X1  pattern.   The   latter   isolates
exhibited   different   resistance,   virulence   and   plasmid   proﬁles,   suggesting   that   mobile   genetic   elements,
particularly   prophages   and   plasmids,   are   of  central   importance   for   the   evolution   and   adaptation   of   S.

serotype  Enteritidis  (S.  Enteritidis),  which  is  mainly  transmitted
through  consumption  of  contaminated  poultry  meat  and  egg  prod-
ucts  [3],  is  the  primary  cause  of  human  salmonellosis  in  many
countries,  including  Tunisia  [4–6].  The  infection  develops  with
diarrhea,  nausea,  vomiting  and  abdominal  cramps,  and  is  usually
self-limiting.  However,  S.  enterica  can  also  cause  severe  invasive
infections,  particularly  in  immune-compromised  hosts,  the  elderly
and  the  very  young  [7,8].  Antimicrobial  agents  are  not  essential
to  control  most  Salmonella  infections,  but  severe,  life-threatening
infections  require  treatment.  In  these  instances,  ﬂuoroquinolones
and  broad  spectrum  cephalosporins  are  the  drugs  of  choice  [8].
Development  of  resistance  to  these  key  antimicrobials  is  hence  a
major  problem  for  public  health.

Multiple  factors  determine  the  virulence  of  S.  enterica,  which
are  primarily  encoded  by  chromosomal  genes,  unlinked  or  clus-
tered  in  islets  (composed  by  a  few  genes)  and  larger  pathogenicity
islands  (SPIs).  In  Salmonella  more  than  20  SPIs  have  been  detected
so  far,  with  SPI1  to  SPI5  being  linked  to  well-deﬁned  pathogenic
processes  [9].  SPI-1  and  SPI-2  encode  different  type  III  secretion
systems  which  deliver  effector  proteins  into  the  cytosol  of  the  host
cell,  leading  to  bacterial  invasion  of  the  intestinal  epithelium  as  well
as  proliferation  of  Salmonella  within  eukaryotic  cells.  SPI-3  encodes
a  magnesium  transporter  involved  in  adaptation  of  Salmonella  to
the  adverse  intracellular  environment.  SPI-4  encodes  a  giant  non-
ﬁmbrial  adhesin  (SiiE)  and  a  type  I  secretion  system  responsible  for
its  transport.  SiiE  mediates  close  interaction  with  microvilli  at  the
apical  side  of  epithelial  cells.  SPI-5  is  connected  with  inﬂammation
and  chloride  secretion  during  the  enteric  phase  of  the  disease  [9,10].
Other  non  SPI-associated  genes  also  play  an  important  role  during
infection,  for  example,  prophage-encoded  genes  and  ﬁmbrial  gene
clusters  [11,12].  In  addition,  some  serotypes  of  S.  enterica,  includ-
ing  S.  Enteritidis,  harbor  virulence-plasmids  of  variable  size,  which
share  the  spv  (Salmonella  plasmid  virulence)  locus.  The  spv  region
seems  to  promote  rapid  growth  and  survival  of  S.  enterica  within  the
host  cells  and  is  thus  believed  to  play  an  important  role  in  systemic
infections  [13].

In  Tunisia,  a  retrospective  study  on  the  occurrence  of  S.  enter-
ica  during  an  11-year  period  (1994–2004),  revealed  S.  Enteritidis
as  the  most  common  serotype  recovered  from  human  specimens
(24.1%;  1640/6815)  and  animals  (69%;  1551/2249),  and  the  second
serotype  found  in  food  products  (15.8%;  877/5539),  only  preceded
by  S.  Anatum.  In  addition,  S.  Enteritidis  was  the  most  common
serotype  in  poultry  (70.3%;  1378/1959)  and  poultry  meat  (27.7%;
415/1496)  [4].  A  more  recent  study  also  supported  the  predom-
inance  of  S.  Enteritidis  in  chicken  products  along  the  2008–2011
years  [6].  Despite  this,  information  available  on  the  resistance  and
genetic  properties  of  isolates  from  chickens  and  environmental
farm  samples  in  Tunisia  is  rather  limited.  The  aim  of  the  present
study  was  the  characterization  of  a  collection  of  S.  Enteritidis
isolates  obtained  from  these  sources  with  respect  to  their  resis-
tance  properties,  virulence  gene  content,  plasmid  patterns  and  XbaI
pulsed-ﬁeld  gel  electrophoresis  (PFGE)  proﬁles.

Materials  and  methods

Bacterial  isolates

Antimicrobial  susceptibility  testing  by  disk  diffusion

Antimicrobial  susceptibilities  for  all  S.  Enteritidis  isolates  were
tested  by  the  disk  diffusion  method  on  Mueller–Hinton  agar  using
commercial  disks  (Oxoid,  Madrid,  Spain),  and  results  were  inter-
preted  according  to  the  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards  Institute
guidelines  [16].  The  following  antimicrobials  were  used:  ampicillin

Genes  encoding  antimicrobial  resistance

Genes  encoding  resistance  to  ampicillin  [blaOXA-1,  blaPSE-1,
blaSHV,  blaTEM-1-like],  streptomycin  [aadA1-like  ,  aadA2,   strA  and  strB]
and  sulfonamides  [sul1,  sul2,  sul3],  selected  according  to  the  resis-
tance  phenotypes,  were  screened  by  PCR,  using  previously  reported
primers  and  conditions  [17].  The  genetic  bases  of  nalidixic  acid
resistance  were  established  by  PCR  ampliﬁcation  and  sequencing
of  the  quinolone  resistance-determining  region  (QRDR)  of  the  gyrA
gene  of  nine  isolates  selected  as  representative  of  different  resis-
tance  proﬁles  [18].  Sequencing  was  conducted  at  Macrogen  Europe
(Amsterdam,  Netherlands).  For  all  S.  Enteritidis  isolates,  the  qnrA,
qnrB,  qnrS  and  aac(6(cid:3))-Ib-cr  genes,  coding  for  plasmid-mediated
quinolone  resistance  (PMQR)  were  also  screened  by  PCR  [19].  To
investigate  the  presence  of  class  1  integrons  in  sul1-  and  sul3-
positive  isolates,  the  presence  of  the  int1  gene  was  investigated
[17].

Virulence  genotyping

tested 

isolates  were 

All  S.  Enteritidis 

for  10  virulence
genes,  selected  for  their  established  association  with  Salmonella
pathogenicity  [9–13].  For  this,  PCR  ampliﬁcations  were  performed
using  previously  published  primers  and  conditions  [20,21].  Five  tar-
get  genes  [orgA,  ssaQ,  mgtC,  spi  4D  (siiD)  and  sopB]  are  located  on
SPI1  to  SPI5,  one  (spvC)  on  the  virulence  plasmid,  three  (gipA,  sodC1
and  sopE1)  on  prophages,  and  one  (bcfC)  on  a  ﬁmbrial  gene  cluster.

During  the  period  2009–2013,  we  have  collected  142  Salmonella
isolates,  which  were  identiﬁed  as  S.  Enteritidis  (85;  60%),  S.  Eppen-
dorf  (22;  15.5%),  S.  Zanzibar  (17;  12%),  S.  Typhimurium  (7;  5%),  S.
Anatum  (5;  3.5%),  S.  Kentucky  (3;  2.1%),  S.  Seftenberg  (2;  1.3%),  S.
Virchow  (1;  0.7%)  and  S.  Solt  (1;  0.7%).  Phenotypic  and  genotypic
characterization  of  the  S.  Eppendorf  isolates  have  previously  been
reported  [14].  In  the  present  study  we  focused  on  S.  Enteritidis  iso-
lates  owing  to  their  high  incidence.  Only  77  out  of  the  85  originally
detected  isolates  could  be  recovered  for  further  analysis.  They  were
obtained  from  samples  (feces,  organs  and/or  embryonic  eggs)  of
healthy  (38)  and  sick  chickens  (8;  suffering  from  colibacillosis  or
pasteurellosis),  and  of  the  farm  environment  (31;  waste  of  hatch-
ing,  feathers,  dust  and  water).  The  isolates  were  collected  in  17
farms  (located  in  central  and  north  eastern  regions  of  the  coun-
try)  or  during  ofﬁcial  controls  along  the  period  of  four  years.  Initial
detection  was  done  according  to  ISO  method  6579/2002  and  the
isolates  were  conﬁrmed  as  Salmonella  by  API  20E  (Bio-Mérieux,
Marcy  l’Etoile,  France).  Serotype  was  determined  by  slide  agglu-
tination  with  the  use  of  antisera  (Bio-Rad,  Marnes-la-Coquette,
France)  to  identify  somatic  O  antigens  and  ﬂagellar  H  antigens,
according  to  the  Kauffmann–White–Le  Minor  scheme  [15].

Plasmid  proﬁles

Plasmid  DNA  was  extracted  by  the  technique  of  Kado  and  Liu
[22]  and  analyzed  by  electrophoresis  on  0.6%  agarose  gels.  Plasmids
from  Escherichia  coli  strains  39R861  and  V517  were  included  as  size
controls.

Pulsed-ﬁeld  gel  electrophoresis  analysis

Thirty  six  representative  isolates  with  different  resistance,  viru-
lence  and  plasmid  combined  proﬁles  were  typed  by  PFGE,  using
the  PulseNet  protocol  with  the  XbaI  (40  U;  Takara  Biomedical,
Madrid,  Spain)  enzyme  (http://www.pulsenetinternational.org/).
Electrophoresis  was  performed  in  a  CHEF-DR  III  (Bio-Rad  Laborato-
ries,  Madrid,  Spain)  with  the  following  settings:  initial  switch  time
2  s,  ﬁnal  switch  time  63  s,  a  gradient  of  6  V/cm,  120◦ angle  and  21  h
of  electrophoresis.  Migration  of  the  DNA  fragments  was   achieved
in  1%  agarose  gels  (w/v;  Ultra-Pure  DNA  Grade  Agarose,  Bio-Rad)
submerged  in  0.5X  TBE  buffer.  XbaI-digested  DNA  of  S.  Braenderup
H9812  was   included  as  size  marker.  The  gels  were  visualized  under

Results

Amongst  the  77  S.  Enteritidis  isolates,  resistances  to  nalidixic
acid,  ampicillin,  sulfonamides  and  streptomycin  were  observed
in  20  (26%),  ﬁve  (6.5%),  three  (3.9%)  and  one  (1.3%)  isolates,
respectively.  In  addition,  a  single  isolate  showed  intermediate
susceptibility  to  ciproﬂoxacin,  but  resistances  to  cefotaxime,  cefox-
itin,  chloramphenicol,  gentamicin,  tobramycin  and  trimethoprim
were  not  detected  (Table  1).  Overall,  51  isolates  (66.2%)  were  sus-
ceptible  to  all  antimicrobials  tested  while  only  26  (33.8%)  were
resistant  to  one  or  more  compounds.  The  genes  responsible  for
the  observed  resistances  are  shown  in  Table  1.  Sulfonamide  resis-
tance  was  encoded  by  sul1  or  sul3,  detected  in  one  and  two   isolates,
respectively.  The  streptomycin-resistant  isolate  harbored  the  strB
gene  but  was  negative  for  strA.  The  blaTEM-1-like and  blaSHV genes
were  found  in  four  and  one  of  the  ampicillin  resistant  isolates,
respectively.  The  gene  intI1,  encoding  the  integrase  of  class  1  inte-
grons,  was  not  detected  in  the  sul1-  or  sul3-positive  S.  Enteritidis
isolates.  Two  mutations  in  the  gyrA  gene,  changing  Asp87  (GAC)  to
Tyr  (TAC)  and  Asp87  (GAC)  to  Asn  (AAC)  were  identiﬁed  as  respon-
sible  for  nalidixic  acid  resistance  in  three  and  two  of  the  isolates
tested,  respectively.  In  four  other  cases,  mutations  in  the  QRDR  of
gyrA  were  not  detected;  thus  further  research  will  be  needed  to
establish  the  genetic  basis  of  their  resistance.  With  regard  to  PMQR
genes,  qnrB  was  present  in  the  single  isolate  with  intermediate  sus-
ceptibility  to  ciproﬂoxacin  (1.3%),  while  qnrA,  qnrS  and  aac(6(cid:3))-Ib-cr
genes  were  not  observed.  By  combining  resistant-phenotypes  and
genes  involved,  a  total  of  seven  proﬁles  (R1  to  R7)  were  identiﬁed
(Table  1).

The  presence  or  absence  of  ten  virulence  genes  was  investigated
in  the  panel  of  77  S.  Enteritidis  isolates  by  PCR  ampliﬁcation  with
speciﬁc  primer  pairs  (Table  1).  The  orgA,  ssaQ,  mgtC,  siiD  (spi4  D)
and  sopB,  selected  as  markers  of  SPI1  to  SPI5,  and  the  spvC  used  as
indicator  of  the  virulence  plasmid  of  S.  Enteritidis,  were  found  in  all
isolates.  The  prophage-associated  sopE1,   gipA  and  sodC  genes  were
detected  in  75  (97.4%),  74  (96.1%)  and  37  (48%)  isolates,  respec-
tively.  The  bcfC  ﬁmbrial  gene  was  present  in  75  (97.4%)  isolates.
Overall,  we  observed  six  distinct  virulence  proﬁles  (V).  The  V1  pro-
ﬁle  that  included  all  tested  genes  was  found  in  34  (44.1%)  isolates;
the  V2  proﬁle  lacking  the  sodC1  gene  was  found  in  36  (46.8%)  iso-
lates;  the  V3,  V4  and  V5  proﬁles  lacking  bcfC,  sopE  plus  sodC1  and
sodC1  plus  gipA,  respectively,  were  each  shown  by  two   isolates;  and
the  V6  proﬁle  lacking  gipA  was  represented  by  a  single  isolate.

Six  plasmid  patterns  (P1–P6)  were  found  in  the  present  study
(Fig.  1A;  Table  1).  All  except  one  isolate  harbored  a  plasmid  of  ca.
60  Kb,  which  is  the  size  expected  for  the  virulence  plasmid  of  S.
Enteritidis.  This  plasmid  appeared  either  alone  (67  isolates;  87%;  P1
proﬁle)  or  together  with  one  or  more  additional  plasmids  ranging
in  size  from  ca.  2  Kb  up  to  80  Kb  (proﬁles  P2–P5,  with  two,  ﬁve,
one  and  one  isolates,  respectively).  The  remaining  isolate  carried  a
single  plasmid  of  ca.  90  Kb  (proﬁle  P6).

Altogether,  19  combinations  of  resistance,  virulence  and
plasmid  proﬁles  were  identiﬁed  (Table  1).  The  most  frequent  com-
bination  (35.1%)  corresponded  to  susceptible  isolates  (R0),  carrying
all  virulence  genes  tested  (V1)  and  containing  the  virulence  plasmid
alone  (P1).  Isolates  positive  for  the  virulence  plasmid,  lacking  sodC1
and  being  either  susceptible  (23.4%)  or  resistant  to  nalidixic  acid
(15.6%)  were  also  very  common.  The  genetic  relatedness  of  36  iso-
lates  covering  different  combinations  of  resistance,  virulence  and
plasmid  proﬁles,  were  investigated  by  PFGE.  Four  closely  related
pulsotypes,  named  X1–X4,  were  found  (Fig.  1B;  Table  1).  The  major
pulsotype  was  X1  that  encompassed  29  isolates,  while  X2,  X3  and

X4  included  only  one,  two  and  four  isolates,  respectively.  X1  was
associated  with  isolates  of  different  origin  (healthy  and  sick  chick-
ens  as  well  as  environmental  samples)  and  with  diverse  resistance,
virulence  and  plasmid  proﬁles.

Discussion

In  this  study,  77  S.  Enteritidis  isolates  recovered  in  Tunisia  from
chicken  facilities  (healthy  and  sick  animals  as  well  as  the  farm
environment)  during  a  period  of  ﬁve  years  were  examined  for
antimicrobial  susceptibility  and  the  genetic  basis  of  the  observed
resistances.  More  than  half  of  the  isolates  were  susceptible  to
all  antimicrobials  tested,  which  is  consistent  with  other  studies
indicating  that  antimicrobial  drug  resistance  is  uncommon  in  S.
Enteritidis  [23–25].  In  the  present  study,  a  low  incidence  of  strepto-
mycin,  ampicillin  and  sulfonamides  resistance  (1.3%,  3.9%  and  6.5%,
respectively),  and  a  relatively  high  level  of  nalidixic  acid  resistance
(26%)  were  observed.  The  spread  of  sulfonamides  resistance  in
Enterobacteriaceae  including  S.  enterica  is  largely  due  to  the  frequent
location  of  sul1  and  sul3  genes  in  class  1  integrons,  which  often  con-
tain  gene  cassettes  encoding  resistance  also  to  other  antimicrobials.
Although  these  genes  were  identiﬁed  as  responsible  for  sulfon-
amides  resistance  in  the  S.  Enteritidis  isolates  from  Tunisia,  neither
intI1  nor  any  gene  cassette  characteristically  associated  with  class
1  integrons,  were  detected  [26].  However,  the  presence  of  defective
class  1  integrons  cannot  be  ruled  out.

Resistance  to  quinolones  has  increasingly  been  reported  in
Enterobacteriaceae  from  animal  and  human  origin  worldwide.  Par-
ticularly,  poultry-derived  S.  Enteritidis  isolates  have  been  shown  to
be  highly  resistant  to  nalidixic  acid,  probably  due  to  the  widespread
use  of  quinolones  in  poultry  production  systems  [27].  Antimicro-
bial  agents  used  to  be  widely  administered  in  animal  husbandry
for  growth  promotion,  a  practice  now  banned  in  many  countries,
but  still  common  in  others.  In  Tunisia  it  was  banned  since  1999,
although  the  law  is  not  enforced.  Unfortunately,  ofﬁcial  documents
about  the  use  of  antimicrobials  in  Tunisian  avian  husbandry  are
not  available.  However,  according  to  veterinarians  and  farmers,
ﬂorfenicol  (fenicol),  oﬂoxacin  (second  generation  ﬂuoroquinolone)
and  doxycycline  (tetracycline)  are  commonly  administered  in  avian
farms  to  treat  some  infections,  speciﬁcally  chronic  respiratory  dis-
eases,  colibacillosis  or  necrotic  enteritis.  These  antimicrobials  are
sometimes  excessively  applied  with  a  concurrent  lack  of  bacteri-
ological  analysis.  Thus,  a  better  control  of  antimicrobial  usage  in
chicken  production  systems  in  Tunisia  is  required.

Quinolone  resistance  is  usually  associated  with  alterations  in  the
gyrA  gene  which  encodes  the  A  subunit  of  the  target  DNA  gyrase.
In  fact,  Asp87  to  Tyr  or  Asp87  to  Asn  mutations  were  found  in  the
gyrA  genes  of  ﬁve  isolates  tested,  these  being  the  most  common
mutations  associated  with  nalidixic  acid  resistance  in  S.  Enteri-
tidis  [23,28,29].  A  single  isolate  carried  the  qnrB  gene,  but  none
of  the  isolates  was   positive  for  qnrA,  qnrS  and  aac(6(cid:3))-Ib-cr  genes.
This  is  consistent  with  a  low-level  rate  of  dissemination  of  PMQR
among  chicken-associated  isolates  of  S.  Enteritidis  in  Tunisia.  In
fact,  PMQR  genes  (qnrA,  qnrB,  qnrS  and  aac(6(cid:3))-Ib-cr)   have  been
previously  reported  in  only  ﬁve  out  of  113  nalidixic  acid  resis-
tant  isolates  of  this  serotype  (4.4%)  recovered  from  different  food
sources,  but  mainly  from  chicken,  during  the  2008–2011  period
in  Tunisia  [6].  The  frequency  of  nalidixic  acid  resistance  reported
in  the  latter  study  (31.4%)  was  close  to  the  value  obtained  for  the
2009–2013  period  reported  herein  (26%).

The  77  S.  Enteritidis  isolates  were  further  characterized  accord-
ing  to  virulotype  and  plasmid  content,  which  resulted  in  six  proﬁles
each.  Nearly  half  of  the  isolates  (44%)  shared  the  same  virulotype
(V1),  which  included  all  virulence  genes  tested.  These  genes  were
selected  as  markers  of  regions  known  to  be  highly  conserved  (SPIs

and  virulence  plasmid)  or  variable  (prophages  and  ﬁmbrial  oper-
ons)  in  S.  Enteritidis.  It  is  well  known  that  prophages  play  a  key
role  in  the  evolution  of  pathogenic  bacteria  such  as  S.  enterica  [11],
leading  to  genotypic  and  phenotypic  diversity  even  between  iso-
lates  of  the  same  serotype.  Fimbriae  also  contribute  to  bacterial
diversity  and  are  considered  to  be  important  for  host  adaptation.
Accordingly,  all  isolates  tested  here  were  positive  for  targets  located
on  SPIs  and  for  spvC,  while  the  observed  variations  were  related
to  the  gipA,  sodC1  and  sopE1  genes,  carried  by  prophages  Gifsy-1,
␭-like  phage  in  S.  Enteritidis,  as  well  as  to
Gifsy-2  and  a  cryptic 
the  bcfC  ﬁmbrial  gene  [11,12,30].  The  least  frequent  virulence  tar-
get  was  sodC1,   found  in  less  than  half  of  the  isolates,  while  the
≥95%.  The  gene  sodC1
frequency  of  all  other  variable  genes  was 
encodes  a  periplasmic  Cu–Zn  superoxide  dismutase  that  promotes
survival  of  S.  Typhimurium  in  macrophages  [31].  In  contrast  to
the  present  study,  high  and  low  frequencies  were  respectively
reported  for  sodC1  and  gipA  in  S.  Enteritidis  isolates  from  differ-
ent  sources  (human,  poultry  and  food)  in  nine  European  countries
[21,32].  This  raises  the  interesting  possibility  of  geographical  varia-
tions  between  Europe  and  North  Africa,  but  similar  variations  have
not  been  observed  within  Europe  [21].

As  mentioned  above,  the  spvC  gene  was  detected  in  all  iso-
lates  analyzed  in  the  present  study,  although  S.  Enteritidis  isolates
lacking  the  virulence  plasmid  have  occasionally  been  reported
[20,21,23,33].  It  should  be  noted  that  all  except  one  of  the  iso-
lates  carried  a  60  Kb  plasmid,  which  is  the  size  expected  for  the
virulence  plasmid.  The  remaining  isolate  contained  a  ca.  90  Kb
plasmid  which  may   have  originated  from  the  smaller  version,

as  the  isolate  was  positive  for  spvC.  In  fact,  larger  derivatives  of
the  virulence  plasmid,  most  carrying  multiple  resistance  genes,
have  previously  been  reported  in  clinical  isolates  of  S.  Enteritidis
[20,34,35].  However,  the  Tunisian  isolate  harboring  the  90  Kb  plas-
mid   was   pan-susceptible,  so  the  role  of  the  DNA  which  was   possibly
acquired  remains  unknown.  In  S.  Enteritidis,  plasmids  of  different
sizes  (ca.  7,  40,  90  and  100  Kb)  have  been  implicated  in  the  spread
of  the  blaTEM-1 gene  for  ampicillin  resistance  [23,36].  In  this  study,
all  ampicillin  resistant  isolates  carried  a  40  Kb  plasmid  where  the
blaTEM-1 gene  could  be  located.  Similarly,  PMQR  genes  have  been
found  on  plasmids  of  variable  size  and  incompatibility  groups,  indi-
cating  that  multiple  plasmids  are  responsible  for  the  worldwide
spread  of  these  genes  [37].  Together  with  60  Kb  and  40  Kb  plas-
mids,  several  small  plasmids,  ranging  in  size  from  2  to  6  Kb,  were
detected  in  the  single  qnrB-positive  isolate  identiﬁed  in  this  study,
which  was   additionally  resistant  to  ampicillin.

XbaI-PFGE  analysis  conducted  for  representative  isolates  iden-
tiﬁed  four  closely  or  possibly  related  pulsotypes,  according  to  the
criteria  of  Tenover  et  al.  [38],  with  a  clear  predominance  of  one  of
them  (X1).  This  pulsotype  was   previously  associated  with  human
isolates  recovered  from  diarrheagenic  stool  samples  in  Tunisia,  as
well  as  from  feces  and  other  clinical  samples  in  different  countries
[5,20,39].  Interestingly,  X1  isolates  exhibited  different  resistance,
virulence  and  plasmid  patterns,  suggesting  that  mobile  genetic  ele-
ments,  particularly  prophages  and  plasmids,  are  playing  an  active
role  in  the  evolution  of  S.  Enteritidis  circulating  in  chicken  farms  in
Tunisia.
