This study aimed to analyze the prevalence of Salmonella isolated from different parts of the food production
chain, and to characterize these isolates. A total of 165 Salmonella enterica isolates were identiﬁed from 1382
samples taken from conventional farms, abattoirs and retail markets from 2010 to 2011 in Sichuan, China. The
Salmonella isolates were assayed for serotype, antimicrobial susceptibility, prevalence of class 1 integrons and
β-lactamase genes, and subtyped using pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis. Among these isolates, S. enterica sero-
types Derby (76 isolates, 46%) and Typhimurium (16 isolates, 10%) were the most prevalent, and high antimicro-
bial resistance rates were observed for tetracycline (77%), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (43%), nalidixic acid
(41%) and spectinomycin (41%). Class 1 integrons were detected in 21% of these isolates, and contained gene cas-
settes dfrA12–aadA2, dfrA1–aadA1, dfrA1, blaPSE-1 and dfrA1/aadA2. blaOXA-1 was the most commonly identiﬁed
β-lactamase gene (n=14), followed by blaTEM-1 (n=6), blaPSE-1 (n=4) and blaCMY-2 (n=1). A S. enterica sero-
type Indiana isolate derived from chicken from a market was positive for both blaOXA-1 and blaCMY-2, and resistant
to nine tested antibiotics. The PFGE patterns were diverse. Our ﬁndings indicated that most isolates from
different sampling sites were phenotypically and genetically diverse, and Salmonella was widespread and
may transmit along the food production chain from farm to market. Isolates with decreased susceptibility
to ﬂuoroquinolones and extended-spectrum cephalosporins, which are used to ﬁght foodborne Salmonella,
pose a serious threat to public health.

1. Introduction

Salmonellosis, caused by Salmonella enterica, is a global foodborne
disease of humans and livestock. Salmonella remains the major cause
of foodborne hospitalizations worldwide (Scallan et al., 2011; Shao
et al., 2011). Although there is an absence of ofﬁcial surveillance
data for Salmonella in China, it is estimated that 22.2% of foodborne
diseases are caused by Salmonella (Wang et al., 2007). Domestic ani-
mals, especially poultry and pigs, are considered to be the major envi-
ronmental reservoirs of Salmonella (Vo et al., 2006). The Salmonella
serotypes isolated from farms have signiﬁcant overlap with those caus-
ing illness in humans (Alcaine et al., 2006), suggesting that Salmonella
from animals can be transmitted to humans via food chain.

The issue of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella poses a signiﬁcant
threat to public health. β-lactams and ﬂuoroquinolones are two im-
portant classes of antibiotics used to treat complicated cases of sal-
monellosis (Gonzalez-Sanz et al., 2009). Resistance to third-generation
cephalosporins is generally a result of production of extended-spectrum
β-lactamases, mostly derived from β-lactamases or AmpC-type enzymes.
Various β-lactamase genes have been detected worldwide in vari-
ous serotypes, located in plasmids or integrons, facilitating rapid trans-
mission among serotypes (Batchelor et al., 2005; Gonzalez-Sanz et al.,
2009; Rayamajhi et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2010). Integrons are DNA ele-
ments capable of capturing and mobilizing antimicrobial resistance
genes among bacteria. The class I integron is the most common integron
type identiﬁed in multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella, and plays an
important role in the dissemination of resistance genes among patho-
gens (Wannaprasat et al., 2011).

With the growth in consumption of food products of animal origin in
China, there is an increased potential for exposure to Salmonella via the
food chain. Unfortunately, most studies on the prevalence and charac-
terization of Salmonella have focused on isolates from farms, abattoirs
or food products in markets separately, not from the combination of

these sites (Visscher et al., 2011; Yan et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2010).
There is also very little research on the potential role of the food produc-
tion chain in the dissemination of MDR Salmonella in China.

In this study, we analyzed the prevalence, serotypes, antimicrobial
resistance, β-lactamase genes and class 1 integrons of Salmonella iso-
lated from farms, abattoirs and markets in Sichuan, China. The objec-
tive of this study was to analyze the correlation between the MDR
proﬁles, serotypes, β-lactamase genes, class 1 integrons and PFGE
patterns of Salmonella isolated from different stages of the food pro-
duction chain, and identify possible routes of Salmonella transmission.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Isolation and identiﬁcation of Salmonella

The sample collection was conducted in farms, abattoirs and mar-
kets of pig, chicken and duck from June 2010 to May 2011 in Sichuan
Province, Southwest China. The number of farms, abattoirs and markets
are described in Table 1, and the number of samples in each farm, abat-
toir or market was not constant and was proportional to the scale of
production. At farms, rectal swabs were collected randomly from an in-
dividual animal of different pigpens or coops. At abattoirs, carcasses
were sampled by swabbing from rump to cheek along the surface of
the carcass. At markets, carcass rinse samples (25 mL buffered peptone
water) were collected for chicken and duck, and grounded meat sam-
ples (25 g) were collected for pork. All the samples were collected ran-
domly and every sampling site was visited only once. The sampling
strategy was deﬁned according to previous researches (Kirchner et al.,
2011; Visscher et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2010). A total of 1382 samples
were collected. The samples were analyzed for Salmonella according
to the method as described by Yan et al. (2010) with some modiﬁca-
tions. Brieﬂy, 25 g (mL) of samples or swabbing cottons samples were
placed into a sterile plastic bag containing 225 mL of buffered peptone
water and shaken vigorously. The rinse was incubated at 37 °C in a
shaking incubator at 120 rpm for 8 h, and then 1 mL of rinse was
added to 10 mL selenite cysteine broth. Broths were incubated at
37 °C for 24 h, followed by streaking of inoculum from the selenite
cysteine broth onto CHROMagar Salmonella plates (CHROMagar, Paris,
France) and incubating at 37 °C for 24 h. Isolates with typical pheno-
type (mauve colony) were conﬁrmed by PCR using a previously de-
scribed method (Rahn et al., 1992).

2.2. Serotyping

Salmonella isolates were serotyped by slide agglutination using
commercially available antiserum (Tianrun Bio-Pharmaceutical, Ningbo,
China), according to manufacturer's instructions.

2.3. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

A standard broth microdilution method, as described by the Clinical
and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, 2009), was carried out to deter-
mine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the following ten
antimicrobial agents: amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, ceftiofur,
ciproﬂoxacin, ﬂorfenicol, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, spectinomycin,

tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Escherichia coli ATCC
25922 was used as the quality control strain. Salmonella isolates resis-
tant to more than two classes of antimicrobials were deﬁned as MDR
isolates.

2.4. Detection of class I integrons and β-lactamase genes

The presence of the class I integron was detected by PCR targeting
the class I integrase gene using previously described primers (Kerrn
et al., 2002). Gene cassettes within the variable region of class I integron
were then ampliﬁed as the described method (Sandvang et al., 1998).
The PCR products were cloned into the pMD18-T vector using the
pMD18-T cloning kit (Takara, Dalian, China), and submitted for sequenc-
ing (Invitrogen, Beijing, China).

The genes encoding β-lactamases were analyzed by PCR using
primers listed in Table 2. The PCR conditions for the ﬁrst ﬁve pairs of
primers were 94 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s,
72 °C for 50 s, and a ﬁnal extension at 72 °C for 7 min. β-lactamase
gene amplicons were sequenced, and then compared to the sequence da-
tabase using the BLAST tool (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/).

2.5. Pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE)

PFGE was performed using the protocol developed by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (Ribot et al., 2006). Brieﬂy, agarose-
embedded DNA was digested with 50 U of XbaI, using Salmonella
Braenderup H9812 as a reference strain. The restriction fragments
were separated using a CHEF MAPPER XA pulsed ﬁeld electrophore-
sis system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Gel images
were analyzed using InfoQuest FP software (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Isolates were considered genetically related if the Dice correlation
coefﬁcient was 80% or greater, according to Tenover's criterion (Tenover
et al., 1995).

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Salmonella prevalence

A total of 165 (12.0%) Salmonella isolates were identiﬁed from 1382
samples (Table 1). Of these isolates, 71 (16.4%), 21 (10.7%) and 20
(10.0%) samples were positive for Salmonella at pig farms, abattoirs and
markets; 30 (28.3%) were positive for Salmonella at chicken markets,
no Salmonella was isolated from samples of chicken farms and abattoirs;
and 6 (12.2%), 10 (21.7%) and 7 (26.9%) were positive for Salmonella at
duck farms, abattoir and markets. The prevalence of Salmonella in con-
taminated food products in other regions of China was 9.4% in raw
meat in 2001 (Wang et al., 2004), 13.1% in pork in 2002–2005 (Jiang
et al., 2006), 18.1% in raw meat in 2005 (Yan et al., 2010), 36.1% in poul-
try meat in 2007 (Cui et al., 2009a) and 44.0% in retail meat in
2007–2008 (Yang et al., 2010). The isolation rate in other parts of the
world was 12.4% in poultry meat in Spain (Alvarez-Fernandez et al.,
2012), 29.3% in poultry meat in Turkey (Arslan and Eyi, 2010), 15.6% in
broiler carcasses in EU (EFSA, 2010) and 35.3% in poultry meat in Mexico
(Miranda et al., 2009). All those studies showed that Salmonella was
widely distributed in retail meat globally, which increased salmonellosis

following consumption of contaminated meat or cross-contamination in
household. Data on the prevalence of Salmonella in different studies
were difﬁcult to compare because the observed prevalence may be bi-
ased by diversity in sampling methods, sampling seasons and technique.
According to previous studies (Cui et al., 2009a; Yan et al., 2010; Yang
et al., 2010), prevalence of Salmonella in China was widespread. In this
study, the prevalence of Salmonella in chicken (28.3%) from markets
was higher than that from abattoirs, indicating that poor hygiene can re-
sult in wide-spreading of Salmonella in retail meat, the hygiene of mar-
kets was very important.

3.2. Serotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Fourteen serotypes were identiﬁed among 129 Salmonella isolates,
and 36 isolates were untypeable (Table 3). The top seven serotypes
were Derby (n=76), Typhimurium (n=16), Potsdam (n=9), Give
(n=6), Tshiongwe (n=4), Kottbus (n=4) and Saintpaul (n=3).
The most commonly isolated serotype from different origins was
Derby, which was the most common serotype isolated from infants
and toddlers in China (Cui et al., 2009b). This suggests an association
between Salmonella-contaminated food and salmonellosis. According
to the Global Foodborne Infections Network (GFN) Country Databank
of the World Health Organisation (http://www.who.int/gfn/activities/
en/), Salmonella Derby was the main serotype identiﬁed in foodstuffs
in China, which differed from ﬁndings in other countries, e.g. Salmonella

Typhimurium in USA and Salmonella Infantis in Japan. According to the
GFN and previous reports (Wang et al., 2004), Salmonella Derby was the
predominant serotype isolated from foods of animal origin in China,
while the main serotype isolated from humans was Salmonella
Typhimurium (Deng et al., 2012). The difference in dominant serotypes
between food producing animals and humans may be due to differences
in pathogenicity of the two serotypes and their respective resistance
proﬁles (Volf et al., 2010).

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 165 S. enterica strains to
ten antimicrobials was also performed (Table 4). High resistance
rates were observed against tetracycline (MIC≥ 16 μg/mL, 77%),
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (MIC≥ 76/4 μg/mL, 43%), nalidixic
acid (MIC≥ 32 μg/mL, 41%), spectinomycin (MIC≥ 64 μg/mL, 41%)
and ampicillin (MIC≥ 32 μg/mL, 25%). The percentages of resis-
tance to gentamicin (MIC≥ 16 μg/mL, 15%), amoxicillin/clavulanic
acid (MIC≥ 32/16 μg/mL, 14%), ciproﬂoxacin (MIC≥ 4 μg/mL, 12%)
and ﬂorfenicol (MIC≥ 16 μg/mL, 10%) were low, and most isolates
were susceptible to ceftiofur (MIC≥ 8 μg/mL, 98%). Decreased sus-
ceptibility to both ciproﬂoxacin (MIC > 0.12 μg/mL) and ceftiofur
(MIC>2 μg/mL) was detected in four isolates from chickens (Salmonella
Indiana and Salmonella Give) and ducks (Salmonella Indiana and
untyped), and two Salmonella Indiana isolates showed resistance
to nine antimicrobials. Co-resistance to ﬂuoroquinolones and extended-
spectrum cephalosporins in these isolates would limit therapeutic op-
tions for Salmonella infections (Whichard et al., 2007).

When resistance proﬁles and serovars were compared (Table 5),
there appeared to be an association between antimicrobial resis-
tance and particular serotypes. Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella
Indiana were more likely to be resistant to seven antimicrobials or
more, but other serotypes showed diverse resistance proﬁles. This in-
dicated that the spread of MDR isolates of Salmonella Typhimurium and
Salmonella Indiana is potentially serious in China, which is in agreement
with previously described ﬁndings (Yang et al., 2010).

3.3. Prevalence of class 1 integrons and β-lactamase genes

Class 1 integrons were detected in 34 Salmonella isolates, nine of
which were negative for the resistance gene cassette. The remaining
25 IntI1-positive Salmonella isolates contained ﬁve groups of resis-
tance gene cassettes, consisting of dfrA12–aadA2 (2 k, n = 12),
dfrA1–aadA1 (1.7 k, n = 1), dfrA1 (1.2 k, n = 4), blaPSE-1 (1.2 k,
n = 3) and dfrA1/aadA2 (1.2 k/1 k, n=5). Four β-lactamase genes
were detected among the isolates. blaOXA-1 was the most commonly iso-
lated β-lactamase gene (n=14), followed by blaTEM-1 (n=6), bla-
PSE-1(n=4) and blaCMY-2(n=1).

All IntI1-positive isolates showed resistance to two or more classes
of antibiotics. This high frequency of MDR among IntI1-positive iso-
lates supports the hypothesis of an association between the presence
of class 1 integrons and emerging MDR in Salmonella (Firoozeh et al.,
2012; O'Mahony et al., 2006; Wannaprasat et al., 2011). The two main
IntI1-positive serotypes were Typhimurium and Derby. All isolates
containing a β-lactamase gene were resistant to ampicillin.

Although blaCMY-2-producing Salmonella have been found in many
countries (Li et al., 2007), the incidence of blaCMY-2-positive Salmonella
in China was thought to be very low, with positive isolates previously
only reported in Shandong and Shanxi Provinces (Yang et al., 2010;
Zhang et al., 2008). In the current survey, a MDR Salmonella Indiana iso-
late harboring both blaOXA-1 and blaCMY-2 exhibited resistance to all test-
ed antimicrobials, except ciproﬂoxacin. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst report of blaCMY-2-positive Salmonella in Sichuan, China.
As one type of AmpC β-lactamase gene, blaCMY-2 encodes resistance to
third-generation cephalosporins, which is an important class of antibi-
otics used to treat complicated cases of salmonellosis (Gonzalez-Sanz
et al., 2009). The spread of blaCMY-2-harboring Salmonella through food,
especially animal-derived food, has important public health implications.

All 165 isolates in this study were subjected to PFGE analysis. The
resultant dendrogram of isolate patterns exhibited clusters with a
high level of diversity; only the PFGE patterns of a small number of
isolates from different parts in the food chain were genetically related
(data not shown). Several reports have shown that clonal groups
could be transmitted along the food chain and represent a hazard to
human health (Hauser et al., 2011, 2012; Nogrady et al., 2008). The
current study indicated that the phenomenon of Salmonella transmis-
sion along the food chain does exist in Sichuan Province. The diversity
of PFGE patterns in this study may be due to either of the two reasons:
ﬁrst, different clones of Salmonella are distributed across different parts
of the food chain in Sichuan Province; and second, that the samples col-
lected were not correlative along the food chain.

Four clusters of PFGE patterns for 22 Salmonella isolates (the other
three isolates were untypeable) containing gene cassettes are presented
in Fig. 1. Clusters A, B and D corresponded to dfrA12–aadA2, dfrA1/aadA2
and dfrA1–aadA1, respectively. Cluster C included two types of cassettes,
dfrA1 and blaPSE-1. Isolate TF23 was isolated from a pig abattoir and
belonged to cluster A, which mainly contained isolates from a pig farm.
Isolate JP21 was isolated from a chicken market and belonged to cluster
B, others of which were isolated from a pig abattoir. The PFGE results
demonstrated that Salmonella can spread along the food production
chain.

In conclusion, food products of animal origin in markets in Sichuan
Province, China, are contaminated with MDR Salmonella, which may orig-
inate from farms further up the food chain, or from horizontal contami-
nation. Keeping the food chain free of Salmonella is vital for preventing
food infection caused by Salmonella, and the hygiene of retail meat
is critical. The high rates of MDR Salmonella detected, IntI1 and bla-
positive isolates suggest that measures to facilitate the reasonable
use of antimicrobials in animal husbandry must be taken. Moreover,
more research into the characteristics of dissemination of Salmonella
and antibiotic resistance genes is warranted.
