Livestock-associated  methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus  aureus  (LA-MRSA)  have  been  reported  in
various  countries  worldwide.  However,  although  China  is  one  of  the  biggest  pig  and  pork  producers,
large-scale  studies  on  pig-associated  LA-MRSA  from  China  are  scarce.  The  aims  of  this  study  were  to
analyze  2420  non-duplicate  samples  collected  from  pigs  at  swine  farms  and  slaughterhouses  in  different
regions  in  China  during  2014  for  the  prevalence  of  pig-associated  MRSA  and  to  determine  the
antimicrobial  resistance  pheno-  and  genotypes  of  the  respective  isolates.  MRSA  isolates  were  identiÔ¨Åed
in  270  (11.2%)  samples.  The  isolates  were  characterized  by  antimicrobial  susceptibility  testing,  multilocus
sequence  typing  (MLST),  spa  typing,  pulsed-Ô¨Åeld  gel  electrophoresis  (PFGE)  and  screening  for  resistance
genes.  All  MRSA  isolates  belonged  to  the  clonal  complex  9  and  spa  type  t899,  but  showed  variable  PFGE
patterns.  All 
isolates  were  non-susceptible  to  oxacillin,  cefoxitin,  clindamycin,  chloramphenicol,
Ô¨Çorfenicol,  ciproÔ¨Çoxacin,  and  valnemulin.  High  rates  of  resistance  were  also  observed  for  tetracycline
(99.6%),  erythromycin  (97.0%),  quinupristin-dalfopristin  (97.0%),  and  gentamicin  (80.4%).  Three  linezolid-
non-susceptible  isolates  containing  the  multi-resistance  gene  cfr  and  nine  rifampicin-non-susceptible
b-lactams  was  exclusively  associated  with
isolates  with  mutations  in  rpoB  were  detected.  Resistance  to 
mecA,  while  phenicol  resistance  was  mainly  attributable  to  fexA,  except  in  the  three  cfr-positive  isolates.
The  pleuromutilin-lincosamide-streptogramin  A  resistance  gene  lsa(E)  was  identiÔ¨Åed  in  all  MRSA
isolates,  and  no  other  pleuromutilin  resistance  genes,  except  cfr  in  three  isolates,  were  detected.  Pigs  are
the  most  important  hosts  of  LA-MRSA  in  China.  Screening  for  pig-associated  MRSA  is  necessary  to
monitor  changes  in  epidemiology  and  characteristics  of  these  important  pathogens.

1.  Introduction

Staphylococcus  aureus  is  a  commensal  opportunistic  pathogen
present 
in  both  healthy  and  diseased  humans  and  animals.
Methicillin-resistant  S.  aureus  (MRSA)  is  considered  to  be  the

most  important  cause  of  nosocomial  and  community-acquired
infections  worldwide  (Woodford  and  Livermore,  2009).  MRSA
evolved  from  methicillin-susceptible  S.  aureus  by  acquisition  of
mecA.  Livestock-associated  MRSA  (LA-MRSA)  was 
Ô¨Årst  detected  in
2004  in  the  Netherlands  and  France,  and  has  since  gained  much
attention  (Armand-Lefevre  et  al.,  2005;  Voss  et  al.,  2005).  The
prevalence  and  spread  of  LA-MRSA  differs  geographically.  The
predominant  clonal  complex  (CC)  in  Europe  and  USA  is  CC398,
with  most  strains  belonging  to  sequence  type  (ST)  398,  whereas  in
Asia,  CC9  strains  are  most  common  with  ST9  being  the  most
prevalent  sequence  type  (Chuang  and  Huang,  2015).

Further  studies  of  LA-MRSA  showed  that  it  was  prevalent  in  a
wide  range  of  animal  species,  particularly  in  pigs  (Weese,  2010;
Wendlandt  et  al.,  2013a).  Human 
infections  caused  by  pig-

associated  MRSA  indicated  that  pigs  are  an  important  reservoir  for
MRSA,  and  that  these  bacteria  are  transferred  to  people  via
occupational  exposure 
the
potential  risk  of  transmission  of  LA-MRSA  between  animals  and
humans  is  a  growing  health  concern.  For  this  reason,  ongoing
surveillance  is  necessary  for  combating  the  further  dissemination
of  LA-MRSA.

(Fitzgerald,  2012).  Thus, 

to  pigs 

To  date,  there  have  been  few  reports  regarding  pig-associated
MRSA  in  mainland  China.  In  2008,  dust  samples  from  nine  farrow-
to-Ô¨Ånish  pig  farms  in  Sichuan  Province  were  screened  for  MRSA,
and  samples  from 
Ô¨Åve  of  the  nine  farms  were  MRSA-positive
(Wagenaar  et  al.,  2009).  In  the  same  year,  the 
Ô¨Årst  study  on  the
prevalence  of  MRSA  colonization  of  pigs  in  mainland  China  was
conducted,  and  reported  a  LA-MRSA  isolation  rate  in  pigs  of  11.4%
(Cui  et  al.,  2009).  In  2009,  nasal  swabs  were  collected  from  590  pigs
in  two  slaughterhouses  in  northeastern  China,  and  38  (6.4%)
samples  were  MRSA-positive.  All  MRSA  isolates  in  this  study  were
identiÔ¨Åed  as  ST9  (Yan  et  al.,  2014).  MRSA  from  pigs  has  also  been
reported  in  Hong  Kong,  which  imports  pigs  from  mainland  China,
with  prevalence  varying  between  16  and  39.3%  (Guardabassi  et  al.,
2009;  Ho  et  al.,  2012a,b).  In  these  cases,  all  pig-associated  MRSA
strains  belonged  to  CC9  and  showed  spa  type  t899.

The  aims  of  the  present  study  were:  (i)  to  investigate  the
prevalence  of  MRSA  colonization  of  pigs  in  mainland  China  in  2014,
(ii)  to  examine  the  phenotype  and  genotype  of  antimicrobial
resistance  in  pig-associated  MRSA  isolates,  and  (iii)  to  determine
the  molecular  characteristics  of  pig-associated  MRSA.

2.  Materials  and  methods

2.1.  Sample  collection

During  June  and  July  2014,  a  total  of  2420  non-duplicate  nasal
swabs  were  collected  from  pig  farms  and  slaughterhouses  in
Shanghai  (n  =  251,  samples  from  two  slaughterhouses),  Henan
(n  =  870,  samples  from  one  pig  farm  and  one  slaughterhouse),
Ningxia  (n  =  473,  samples  from  one  slaughterhouse  and  two  pig
farms),  and  Shandong  (n  =  826,  samples  from  25  pig  farms),  China.
The  pig  farms  and  slaughterhouses  were  selected  at  random  from
the  intensive  pig  farms  or  slaughterhouses  in  each  region,  but  were
widely  dispersed  geographically.  Farm  samples  were  collected
from 
from
slaughterhouses  were  collected  immediately  after  slaughter  from
individual  pigs.  For  each  slaughterhouse,  samples  were  collected
over  the  course  of  a  single  day.  All  nasal  swabs  were  placed  into
tubes  containing  1  ml  of  7.5%  sodium  chloride  broth,  which
contained  0.5%  beef  powder,  7.5%  sodium  chloride  and  1.0%
peptone,  before  being  transported  to  the  laboratory.

Ô¨Ånishing  pigs  of  different  herds,  while  samples 

2.2.  MRSA  isolation  and  identiÔ¨Åcation

The  sodium  chloride  broths  containing 

the  swabs  were
incubated  at  37 C  for  24  h.  Following  incubation,  cultures  were
plated  onto  S.  aureus  selective  agar  plates  (CHROMagar  Staph
aureus,  Becton  Dickinson  GmbH,  Paris,  France)  supplemented  with
4  mg/L  cefoxitin.  Following  incubation  for  24  h  at  37 C,  any  pink/
mauve  colonies  were  selected  as  suspected  S.  aureus  isolates.
Further  identiÔ¨Åcation  was  performed  by  multiplex-PCR  analysis,  as
described  previously  (Louie  et  al.,  2002).

2.3.  Antimicrobial  susceptibility  testing

Antimicrobial  susceptibility  testing  was  performed  using  both
the  broth  microdilution  and  disk  diffusion  methods  according  to
documents  VET01-S4  and  M100-S25  of  the  Clinical  and  Laboratory
Standards  Institute  (CLSI,  2015a,b).  The  following  antimicrobial

2.4.  Resistance  gene  detection

In  addition  to  the 

b-lactam  resistance  genes  mecA  and  mecC,  all
pig-associated  MRSA  isolates  were  also  screened  by  PCR  for  the
presence  of  the  following  resistance  genes:  fexA,  fexB,  cfr,  optrA,  lsa
(E),  lsa(B),  vga(A),  vga(B),  vga(C),  vga(D),  vga(E),  vga(E)v,  and  vga
(A)LC (Ho  et  al.,  2012a;  Wendlandt  et  al.,  2015a,b;  Li  et  al.,  2016)
accounting  for  resistance  to  phenicols,  oxazolidinones,  pleuro-
mutilins,  lincosamides,  and/or  streptogramin  A  antibiotics.

2.5.  Molecular  typing

Pulsed-Ô¨Åeld  gel  electrophoresis  (PFGE)  with  SmaI  was  used  to
characterize  all  isolates.  An  80%  cutoff  was  used  to  deÔ¨Åne  a  PFGE
cluster.  One  or  two  isolates  from  each  PFGE  pattern  were  selected
from  each  region  of  China  for  use  as  representative  isolates  for
multilocus  sequence  typing  (MLST)  and  spa  typing.  MLST  was
conducted  by  amplifying  and  sequencing  fragments  of  seven
housekeeping  genes  (arcC,  aroE,  glpF,  gmk,  pta,  tpi,  and  yqiL)
(Enright  et  al.,  2000).  The  MLST  type  was  determined  by
comparison  with  the  sequences  deposited  in  the  online  MLST
database 
typing  was
performed  by  amplifying  and  sequencing  the  variable  repeat
region  of  the  spa  gene,  which  was  then  compared  with  the  spa
sequences  of  the  respective  online  database  (http://spa.ridom.de/)
(Harmsen  et  al.,  2003).

3.  Results

3.1.  Prevalence  of  pig-associated  MRSA

MRSA  was  identiÔ¨Åed  in  270  (11.2%)  of  the  2420  samples.  The
prevalence  of  MRSA  differed  signiÔ¨Åcantly  between  the  different
regions:  Shanghai  (46.6%),  Henan  (5.2%),  Ningxia  (3.6%),  and
Shandong  (12.0%).  MRSA  isolates  were  identiÔ¨Åed  at  a  particularly
high  rate  from  both  of  the  slaughterhouses  in  Shanghai,  and  were
present  in  samples  from  14/25  farms  in  Shandong.  However,
isolation  rates  were  much  lower  in  samples  from  Henan  and
Ningxia  provinces  (Table  S1).

3.2.  Antimicrobial  susceptibility  testing

All  270  pig-associated  MRSA  isolates  were  non-susceptible  to
oxacillin,  cefoxitin,  clindamycin,  chloramphenicol, 
Ô¨Çorfenicol,  and
ciproÔ¨Çoxacin.  Moreover,  all  of  the  isolates  grew  on  selective  plates
containing  1  mg/L  valnemulin.  High  resistance  rates  were  also
observed  for  tetracycline  (99.6%),  erythromycin  (97.0%),  quinu-
pristin-dalfopristin  (97.0%),  and  gentamicin  (80.4%).  Nine  rifampi-
cin-non-susceptible  MRSA  isolates  (two  from  Shanghai  and  seven
from  Shandong)  were  identiÔ¨Åed.  Two  isolates  from  Shanghai  and
one  from  Shandong  were  non-susceptible  to  linezolid.  All  of  the
isolates  were  susceptible  to  vancomycin  (Table  1).

3.3.  Resistance  gene  detection

The  presence  of  genes  conferring  resistance  to 

b-lactams,
phenicols,  oxazolidinones,  pleuromutilins,  lincosamides,  and/or
streptogramin  A  antibiotics  was  conÔ¨Årmed  by  PCR.  Most  of  the
resistance  genes  were  homogeneously  distributed  among  all
b-lactams  was  exclusively  associated  with
isolates.  Resistance  to 
the  presence  of  mecA;  no  mecC  carriers  were  identiÔ¨Åed.  The
pleuromutilin-lincosamide-streptogramin  A  resistance  gene  lsa(E)
was  identiÔ¨Åed  in  all  of  the  MRSA  isolates,  and  no  other  pleuro-
mutilin  resistance  genes,  except  cfr  in  three  isolates,  were  detected.
Three 
isolates  contained  the  multi-
resistance  gene  cfr,  which  confers  resistance 
to  phenicols,
lincosamides,  oxazolidinones,  pleuromutilins,  and  streptogramin
A.  Most  of  the  phenicol-resistant 
isolates,  except  the  three
cfr-positive  isolates,  harbored  fexA.  None  of  the  isolates  contained
the 
Ô¨Çorfenicol  resistance  gene  fexB,  or  the  novel  oxazolidinone-
phenicol  resistance  gene  optrA.

linezolid-non-susceptible 

3.4.  Molecular  typing

The  270  isolates  were  assigned  to  11  PFGE  types  (A‚ÄìK).  PFGE
types  A  (40.7%),  C  (19.6%),  and  D  (10.7%)  accounted  for  71.0%  of  the
isolates.  Two  PFGE  patterns,  types  B  and  D,  were  detected  in  all  four
geographic  regions,  while  PFGE  patterns  H,  I,  and  K,  each  with  only
one  or  two  isolates,  were  more  unevenly  distributed  (Table  2).
Based  on  the  PFGE  typing  results,  44  isolates  belonging  to  different
PFGE  patterns  and  originating  from  each  of  the  four  regions  were
selected  as  representative  isolates  for  MLST  and  spa  analyses.
Except  one  isolate  from  Henan,  which  was  ST1376-t899,  all  of  the
other  representative  isolates  were  ST9-t899  (Fig.  1).  ST1376  is  a
single  locus  variant  of  ST9  (allele  73  instead  of  allele  3  in  aroE)  and
also  belongs  to  CC9.

4.  Discussion

This  study  investigated  pig-associated  MRSA  using  a  large
number  of  samples  collected  from  four  different  geographical
areas  in  China.  The  results  indicated  a  higher  average  prevalence  of
nasal  MRSA  carriage  of  pigs  in  China  (11.2%)  compared  with  other
Asian  countries,  including  Japan  (0.9%,  1/115  samples)  (Baba  et  al.,
2010),  Malaysia  (1.4%,  5/360  samples)  (Neela  et  al.,  2009),  and
South  Korea  (3.2%,  21/657  samples)  (Lim  et  al.,  2012).  Possible
explanations  for  the  increased  prevalence  include  differences  in
the  isolation  methods,  livestock  density,  antimicrobial  usage,  and
management  systems  between  China  and  other  Asian  countries.
However,  compared  with  previous  studies  in  China,  the  average
prevalence  of  nasal  carriage  of  pig-associated  MRSA  in  this  study

in  the  two  slaughterhouses 

was  similar  to  that  described  in  a  study  conducted  in  2008  (11.4%),
in  which  samples  were  also  collected  from  both  pig  farms  and
slaughterhouses  (Cui  et  al.,  2009).  This  observation  suggested  that
the  average  nasal  carriage  rate  of  MRSA  was  rather  stable  during
recent  years  in  China.  However,  differences  were  seen  between  the
MRSA  prevalence  in  the  different  regions  investigated  with  highest
prevalence  being  detected 
from
Shanghai.  It  has  been  shown  that  pigs  can  become  colonized  with
MRSA  in  the  short  period  of  time  between  transportation  from  the
farm  to  the  slaughterhouse  (Broens  et  al.,  2011).  A  longitudinal
study  showed  that  pigs  from  a  MRSA-negative  farm  became  MRSA-
positive  after  co-transportation  with  MRSA-positive  pigs  (Bang-
erter  et  al.,  2016).  This  may  explain  the  higher  prevalence  of  MRSA
at  the  slaughterhouses  in  Shanghai  in  this  study  as  well  as  in
another  study  in  which  samples  were  only  collected  from  one
slaughterhouse  (Ho  et  al.,  2012b).  Compared  with  other  regions,
pigs  from  Ningxia  had  a  much  lower  prevalence  of  MRSA  carriage.
A  possible  reason  for  this  could  be  the  lower  livestock  density  and
the  different  dietary  habits  in  this  region.

in  commercial 

All  of  the  pig-associated  MRSA  isolates  in  this  study  were
multidrug-resistant.  Antimicrobial  agents  are  used  in  the  rearing  of
food-producing  animals  not  only  for  prevention  and  treatment  of
disease,  but  also  for  growth  promotion.  Based  on  the  records  of
antibiotic  usage 
farms,  antimicrobial  agents,
including  enroÔ¨Çoxacin,  tetracycline,  oxytetracycline,  chlortetracy-
cline,  lincomycin,  and  tiamulin,  are  commonly  used  in  pig  farming
in  China.  The  use  of  these  antibiotics  may  inÔ¨Çuence  the  antibiotic
resistance  patterns  of  pig-associated  MRSA.  Our  previous  study
showed  that  rifampicin-non-susceptibility  of  the  isolates  from
Shanghai  and  Shandong  was  caused  by  mutations  in  the  gene  rpoB.
These  mutations  may  occur  spontaneously  or  originate  from  co-
selection  in  the  presence  of 
Ô¨Çuoroquinolones  (Li  et  al.,  2016).
Unexpectedly,  all  of  the  pig-associated  MRSA  isolates  identiÔ¨Åed  in
this  study  carried  the  multiresistance  gene  lsa(E)  which  confers
resistance  to  lincosamides,  pleuromutilins  and  streptogramin  A
antibiotics.  The  location  of  lsa(E)  on  a  plasmid  may  play  a  role  in  its
persistence  and  dissemination  (Li  et  al.,  2013;  Wendlandt  et  al.,

2013b,  2015b).  Linezolid-non-susceptible  isolates  containing  the
phenicol-lincosamide-oxazolidinone-pleuromutilin-streptogra-
min  A  resistance  gene  cfr  were  detected  in  two  different  regions.
Although  clindamycin  and  linezolid  are  not  approved  for  use  in  pig
farming,  selective  pressure 
from  other  antibiotics,  such  as
lincomycin, 
Ô¨Çorfenicol  and  tiamulin,  that  are  widely  used  in
food-producing  animals  could  promote  the  spread  of  cfr. 
In

addition,  the  emergence  and  dissemination  of  these  multidrug-
resistant  isolates  in  pigs  pose  a  signiÔ¨Åcant  risk  to  people  with
continuous  exposure  to  livestock.

As  shown  by  the  PFGE  typing  results,  each  region  had  its  own
predominant  PFGE  pattern.  The  appearance  of  MRSA  isolates  with
the  same  PFGE  pattern  in  different  regions  implied  an  exchange  of
MRSA  strains  between  the  regions,  most  likely  through  the  transfer

of  animals.  MLST  and  spa  typing  were  used  as  basic  typing  tools  for
tracing  the  evolutionary  origin  and  spread  of  MRSA,  but  their
discriminatory  power  appeared  too  limited  for  pig-associated
MRSA  in  China.  Although  the  PFGE  patterns  of  the  isolates  showed
more  variation  than  was  observed  by  MLST  and  spa  typing,  new
technologies,  such  as  next  generation  sequencing,  may  provide
better  options  for  understanding  the  origin,  transmission  and
evolution  of  LA-MRSA.  Therefore,  these  advanced  technologies  will
be  included  in  our  further  studies  of  the  origin  and  spread  of  pig-
associated  MRSA  in  China.

5.  Conclusion

In  the  present  study  conducted  in  2014,  the  nasal  carriage  rate
of  MRSA  in  pigs  (11.2%)  was  similar  compared  to  that  reported  by
Cui  and  co-workers  in  2008  (11.4%)  (Cui  et  al.,  2009).  ST9-t899  was
still  the  predominant  clonal  type  of  LA-MRSA  isolates  in  China,  and
the  pig-associated  MRSA  isolates  identiÔ¨Åed  in  this  study  showed
resistance  to  a  wide  range  of  antibiotics.  SigniÔ¨Åcantly,  all  of  the
isolates  carried  the  multi-resistance  gene  lsa(E),  with  three  isolates
also  harboring  the  multi-resistance  gene  cfr.  As  zoonotic  infections
caused  by  MRSA  ST9  have  been  reported  in  the  Netherlands
(van  Loo  et  al.,  2007)  and  in  China  (Liu  et  al.,  2009),  ongoing
surveillance  is  needed  to  detect  changes  in  the  characteristics  and
epidemiology  of  these  strains.
