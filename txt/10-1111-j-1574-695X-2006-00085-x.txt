Abstract

A study was conducted to determine the prevalence of Campylobacter with
antimicrobial resistance from chickens, pigs, dairy cows, healthy farm workers,
and children hospitalized with diarrhea in northern Thailand. Resistance was
highest in pig samples and lowest in healthy farm workers. Resistance to
ﬂuoroquinolones and tetracycline was high in all study populations. The increased
prevalence of resistant isolates from meat samples collected at markets, compared
to isolates collected from animals on the farm or the slaughterhouse, suggests that
contamination after carcasses leave the slaughterhouse is an important factor in
the spread of resistant bacteria into the human food chain.

Introduction

Campylobacter ssp. is a major foodborne bacterium affecting
mainly children in developing countries and young adults in
industrialized countries (Oberhelman & Taylor, 2000; Coker
et al., 2002). The clinical signs of Campylobacter infection in
humans include fever, myalgia, and arthralgia (Sanders
et al., 2002), and it has been reported as a cause of travelers’
diarrhea (Hakkanen et al., 2003). In Thailand, Campylobac-
ter was the most common pathogen found in children less
than 12 years old with dysentery (Bodhidatta et al., 2002).

The main source of Campylobacter in human infections is
believed to be from consumption of foods of animal origin
(Osano & Arimi, 1999; Kalman et al., 2000) or other cross-
contaminated foods, and from drinking contaminated water
(Kapperud et al., 2003). Previous studies in Thailand
showed the prevalence of Campylobacter ssp. to be over
60% in broilers (Padungtod et al., 2002) and 12% in foods of
animal origin purchased at market (Rasrinual et al., 1988).
Fortunately, only a few species of Campylobacter result in
clinical disease in animals, including Campylobacter fetus
ssp. fetus and Campylobacter fetus ssp. venerealis, which
cause reproductive diseases (Sanders et al., 2002). Other
species of Campylobacter, including those causing enteritis
in humans, do not result in clinical disease in animals. For

this reason, infection in food animals can go unnoticed, and
can be an important source of human infection and disease
caused by Campylobacter.

Another issue of concern regarding Campylobacter is the
increase in antimicrobial resistance appearing in various
regions around the world (Bywater et al., 2004; Gupta et al.,
2004; Hart et al., 2004). Infection to these resistant Campy-
lobacter may lead to suboptimal outcomes of antimicrobial
treatment (Sanders et al., 2002) or treatment failure (Butt
et al., 2003). Antimicrobial resistance in both human and
animal Campylobacter isolates has become increasingly
common in Thailand and other developing countries (Isen-
barger et al., 2002). An earlier study in Thailand found high
proportions of Campylobacter resistant
to a variety of
antimicrobial agents, including ﬂuoroquinolones (nalidixic
acid and ciproﬂoxacin) (Padungtod et al., 2003).

Since the 1990s there has been evidence suggesting that
the increased prevalence of Campylobacter with resistance to
antimicrobial agents, particularly ﬂuoroquinolones, may be
a result of the use of these agents in food animals (Endtz
et al., 1991; Smith et al., 1999), and that antimicrobial use in
food animal production may contribute to the increase of
antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in humans (Smith et al.,
2002). However, in Thailand, it has been suggested that food
animals such as poultry may only have a limited role in the

increased antimicrobial resistance (Boonmar et al., 2005).
Given these conﬂicting ﬁndings, this study was conducted to
determine the prevalence and serotypes of Campylobacter
with antimicrobial resistance, from chickens, pigs, dairy
cows, healthy farm workers, and diarrhea patients in a
farming community in northern Thailand. Comparison of
antimicrobial susceptibility proﬁles of Campylobacter iso-
lated from these populations may provide an insight into the
development and transmission of antimicrobial-resistant
Campylobacter in Thailand.

Materials and methods

Sampling sites

All sampling sites were located in the Chiang Mai and
Lamphung provinces of northern Thailand, and were
selected to be within 3 h (90 km) of the laboratory. These
study locations included farms, slaughterhouses, fresh meat
markets, and hospitals. In addition, the farms, slaughter-
houses and markets selected needed to keep records so that
animals could be tracked from the farm to the slaughter-
house, and subsequently from slaughter to the markets.
Samples were collected and processed during May–July of
2000–2003. The prevalence of Campylobacter collected from
chickens and pigs in this study was highest at the farm, and
Campylobacter was isolated from 18% of children with
diarrhea at the hospital (Padungtod & Kaneene, 2005).

The chicken and pig farms in this study were not large,
industrialized facilities, but were parts of integrated produc-
tion systems. Antimicrobial use on these farms was regu-
lated by the companies purchasing these animals for
slaughter. The only hygenic measures practiced were the
use of footbaths at the entrances of animal housing units.
Chicken samples were collected from broiler production
farms, where large numbers of birds were kept in closed
buildings. The chickens were fed coccidiostats (e.g. ampro-
lium) and antimicrobial agents (including sulfamethoxazole
and enroﬂoxacin) during the raising period, but were not
treated with antimicrobial agents prior to sample collection.
Pig samples were collected from ﬁnishing operations, with
no sows or piglets housed on the premises. The pigs were
housed in open buildings which did not exclude free-ﬂying
wild birds. Pigs in this study received lincomycin and tylosin
prior to their arrival at the ﬁnishing operation, but no
antimicrobial agents were present in feeds while at ﬁnishing.
Dairy cattle in this study were adult animals from small
farms (10–20 milking animals), housed in free-stall barns
with little pasture access. High levels of hygiene were
practiced on dairy farms, where milk prices depend on the
cleanliness of the operation.

Individual animals were randomly selected for sampling,
based on their age and stage of production, and were

animals that did not receive antimicrobial treatment at the
farm prior to sampling. Fecal samples were collected with
swabs of the rectum (pigs, dairy cows) or cloaca (chickens).
Pigs o1 month old prior to slaughter, chickens o2 weeks
old prior to slaughter, and milking cows were included in
the on-farm study. The same pigs and chickens were tracked
and sampled at the slaughterhouse and again at the markets.
All workers on the farms participating in the study, and
the parents of all children with diarrhea in the hospitals
within the study area were contacted for participation while
the child was hospitalized. Participants were excluded if they
had received any antimicrobial treatments during the study
period prior to sample collection. Due to the low numbers
of possible human samples, efforts were made to contact
and enroll all possible candidates. Approval to conduct
research involving human subjects and animals was given
by the Chiang Mai University Committees on Human
Subjects and Animal Research, respectively. Farm workers
usually lived on the farms where they worked, but did not
live in animal housing units. The water supply to workers
and animal may have come from the same sources. The
pediatric population with diarrhea may have come from
urban areas, where the water was treated with chlorine.

The slaughterhouses participating in our study were
small-scale facilities providing meat for local market con-
sumption, and efforts were made to sample animals from
the farms participating in the study. The poultry slaughter-
houses processed 500–800 birds per night. At the slaughter-
house, birds from various farms were kept together in the
holding pen while waiting to be slaughtered by hand. After
mechanical defeathering, carcasses were chilled in cold water
without evisceration, since evisceration is done at
the
market to provide consumers with viscera for separate
purchase. Slaughterhouse samples were collected from
chickens from study farms, after defeathering and before
chilling. The pig slaughterhouse in this study did not use
machinery for the slaughtering process. After slaughter, the
pigs were dehaired, eviscerated, and cut into six pieces by
hand. The slaughterhouse samples were collected from the
pigs from study farms at the end of the butchering process,
but before shipment to market. At the slaughterhouse,
samples were collected by swabbing an approximately
50 cm2 area of the pig carcass with sterile gauze, and cotton
swabs were used to swab under the wing and surrounding
the cloaca of the chicken carcass. Samples of mesenteric
lymph nodes were collected from pigs at the end of butcher-
ing. Pig carcasses, including visceral organs, were delivered
to the market directly after slaughtering.

At the fresh meat market, approximately 100 g of pork
from the neck area attached to the head (with the ear tag)
and 200 g of thigh meat from each chicken were purchased.
Efforts were made to sample animals from the farms
participating in the study. All farm, slaughterhouse, and

market environmental samples were collected using a sterile
gauze swab soaked in sterile skim milk, which was used as a
transport media for these samples. All samples were held in
an icebox or refrigerator until further processing, which was
completed within 48 h of collection.

Bacterial isolation

All swabs and meat samples were suspended in 10 mL
Bolton broth (BB; Oxoid, UK) supplemented with antimi-
crobial agents (cefoperazone, vancomycin, trimethoprim,
amphotericin B) as enrichment media to resuscitate da-
maged cells and to limit the growth of other bacteria. The
broth was incubated at 42 1C, 5% CO2 for 48 h. A swab of
the broth was inoculated onto Karmali (KSA) or Preston
agar (PA; Oxoid) supplemented with antimicrobial agents
(sodium pyruvate, vancomycin, cefoperazone, amphotericin
B for KSA; polymyxin B, trimethoprim, rifampicin, cyclo-
heximide for PA) as selective media. For fecal, cloacal, and
rectal swabs, samples were inoculated directly on KSA.
Selective media plates were incubated at 42 1C, 5% CO2 for
up to 5 days. A single colony of bacteria with Campylobacter
characteristics was selected from each plate for biochemical
tests. Gram-negative, spiral rods with positive oxidase and
catalase tests were identiﬁed as Campylobacter, and grown
on Brucella agar supplemented with sheep’s blood (BASB).
After 48 h of incubation at 42 1C, 5% CO2, the bacteria were
suspended in Mueller–Hinton broth, then mixed with an
equal volume of 60% glycerol and stored in a  70 1C
freezer.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Our study used both the broth microdilution technique and
disk diffusion technique to categorize Campylobacter into
resistant and nonresistant groups. Both techniques were
shown to yield comparable minimal inhibitory capacity
(MIC) values and similar resistance classiﬁcation results
(Frediani-Wolf & Stephan, 2003).

For Campylobacter isolates collected from 2000–2002,
antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done using the
microbroth dilution technique following the National
Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS,
2000). The antimicrobial agents tested included ampicillin,
azithromycin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nalidixic acid,
tetracycline, ciproﬂoxacin, and erythromycin. Approxi-
mately 105 CFU per mL of bacterial suspension, turbidity
adjusted to a 0.5 McFarland standard, was inoculated into a
96-well microtiter plate containing twofold dilutions of
antimicrobial agents. After incubation in micro-aerobic
conditions for 44–48 h, the MIC was determined by obser-
ving the growth of bacteria in each well. The MIC is the
minimum concentration of an antimicrobial agent that
inhibits growth of the bacteria. The breakpoints provided

by the U.S. National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring
System (NARMS, 2003) were used to categorize Campylo-
bacter into resistant and nonresistant groups. Staphylococcus
aureus NTCC25922 and Escherichia coli NTCC29213 were
used as quality control organisms. Plate counts were con-
ducted to conﬁrm the concentrations of bacterial inoculum
used in testing.

For Campylobacter isolates collected in 2003, reductions
in funding necessitated the use of the less-expensive disk
diffusion technique for antimicrobial susceptibility testing
(Gaudreau & Gilbert, 1997). Approximately 108 CFU per
mL bacterial suspensions were inoculated onto Mueller–
Hinton agar. Commercially prepared antimicrobial disks
(Oxoid) were used, and included ampicillin, chlorampheni-
col nalidixic acid, tetracycline, ciproﬂoxacin and erythro-
mycin. After incubation in micro-aerobic conditions for
44–48 h, the zones of inhibition (in mm) were measured
with calipers, and NCCLS breakpoints were used to categor-
ize Campylobacter into resistant and nonresistant groups.

Speciation of Campylobacter

For isolates collected and isolated from 2000 to 2002, API-
Campy (bioM´erieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France) kits were used
for species identiﬁcation following the manufacturer’s re-
commendations. For Campylobacter isolates collected in
2003, reductions in funding necessitated the use of a multi-
plex PCR assay (Wang et al., 2002) to identify the species of
Campylobacter isolate. In brief, the multiplex PCR was
started by suspending a 48 h culture of the bacteria in sterile
water. A phenol–chloroform extraction protocol (Ausubel
et al., 1999) was used to extract the DNA from the bacteria.
Then, 2.5 mL of DNA template was added to the multiplex
PCR mixture containing 1.25 unit of Taq DNA polymerase
(Paciﬁc Sciences, Bangkok, Thailand)
reaction buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCL, pH 8.3, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM [NH4]2SO4),
20 mM MgCl2, 200 mM deoxynucleoside
triphosphate
(dNTPs), and the 12 primers set. The multiplex PCR was
carried out in a thermal cycler (Thermohybaid, Waltham,
MA) using the following procedure: initial denaturation at
95 1C for 6 min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 1C for 30 s,
annealing at 59 1C for 30 s, extension at 72 1C for 30 s, and
ﬁnal extension at 72 1C for 7 min. The resulting product was
visualized by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis
stained
with EtBr2. The species were identiﬁed based on the size of the
product compared with a known Campylobacter ssp. control.

Statistical analysis

The prevalence of resistance was calculated by dividing the
number of samples with resistant Campylobacter by the total
number of Campylobacter processed. Testing for signiﬁcant
differences in the prevalence of resistant Campylobacter
from various populations, locations, and sample types were

conducted using the Chi-squared test, or Fisher’s exact test
when numbers did not meet the necessary assumptions for
the chi-squared test (cell counts o 5).

Results

The recovery rate of isolates for susceptibility testing from
frozen isolate stocks was approximately 60%. A total of 686
Campylobacter isolates were tested, including 324 isolates
from chickens, 319 from pigs, 15 from dairy animals, and 28
isolates from humans (Table 1). The remaining 24 were
positive for the Campylobacter 23s RNA gene, but did not
yield speciﬁc bands for species identiﬁcation. Consequently,
we were unable to speciate some isolates from chickens (14
on the farm, nine at slaughter, one at market), dairy cattle
(6), pigs (1 on the farm), and children hospitalized with
diarrhea (5). By species, Campylobacter coli made up the

Campylobacter isolates, while C. jejuni was recovered from
most dairy cattle (10/17) and some chicken (93/241) frozen
isolates. The majority of Campylobacter recovered from
healthy farm worker isolates were C. coli (3/5), whereas C.
jejuni was the most prominent species recovered from
isolates collected from children hospitalized with diarrhea
(20/29). By host species on the farm, the highest levels of
resistance seen were to nalidixic acid in isolates from
chickens (60%), tetracycline in isolates from pigs (88%),
and ciproﬂoxacin in dairy cattle isolates (29%). At slaughter,
90% of chicken isolates and 77% of pig isolates demon-
strated resistance to nalidixic acid. Both chicken and
pig isolates from the market demonstrated high levels of
resistance to ciproﬂoxacin (91% and 100%, respectively).
The most common form of resistance seen in Campylobacter
isolates from healthy adults was to nalidixic acid (60%),
whereas the majority of isolates from children hospitalized
with diarrhea demonstrated resistance to erythromycin
(78%).

There were signiﬁcant differences (P o 0.01) in the pre-
valence of resistant Campylobacter among animals at the
farm for all agents tested except ampicillin (Table 2). There
were also signiﬁcant differences in the prevalence of resis-
tance between sampling locations for all agents tested except
chloramphenicol and gentamicin.

In chickens, the highest prevalence of resistance to most
agents was observed at the market, with the exception of
azithromycin. The highest resistance was found to ﬂuoro-
quinolones (ciproﬂoxacin and nalidixic acid) and tetra-
cycline at all sampling points. Signiﬁcant differences were
observed for ciproﬂoxacin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline,

but not for erythromycin and azithromycin. No resistance to
chloramphenicol and gentamicin was observed in chickens.
In pigs, the highest prevalences of resistance were ob-
served at market, except for the macrolides erythromycin
and azithromycin, where resistance was highest on the
farms. Signiﬁcant differences were observed for all other
agents except nalidixic acid, chloramphenicol, and genta-
mycin. In dairy cattle, resistance to ciproﬂoxacin was higher
than other agents tested. In healthy farm workers, the
prevalence of resistance was highest to nalidixic acid. In the
diarrhea patients the prevalence of resistance was highest to
erythromycin. No resistance to chloramphenicol and genta-

There were signiﬁcant (P o 0.01) differences in the
numbers of antimicrobial agents to which Campylobacter
isolates were resistant, based on the source population of the
Campylobacter isolates (Fig. 1), but no signiﬁcant difference
was observed between sampling locations (P = 0.07). Multi-
drug resistance was found in Campylobacter isolates from all
species tested. Chicken isolates were most frequently resis-
tant to three or fewer agents, and isolates from dairy cattle
and humans were most frequently resistant to one and two
agents, respectively. The majority of Campylobacter isolates
from pigs were resistant to ﬁve or fewer isolates, with the
largest number of those isolates resistant to ﬁve antimicro-

bial agents. More multiresistant isolates were found in farm
samples than slaughter samples for pigs and chickens: 89%
of pig farm isolates and 66% of pig slaguther isolates were
resistant to three or more agents, compared to 10% of
chicken farm isolates and 4% of chicken slaughter isolates.
Multi-resistance was low in chicken samples (3% resistant to
three or more agents), but higher in pigs (57%). The most
common combinations of multiresistance seen were to
ciproﬂoxacin–nalidixic
acid–tetracycline–erythromycin–
azithromycin (143 isolates), and ciproﬂoxacin–nalidixic
acid–tetracycline (135 isolates) (Table 3).

Antimicrobial resistance patterns of C. jejuni and C. coli

ciproﬂoxacin and nalidixic acid was signiﬁcantly higher
(P  0.05) in C. coli than in C. jejuni, whereas tetracycline
resistance was signiﬁcantly higher in C. jejuni than C. coli.
Higher levels of resistance to azithromycin, erythromycin,
and clindamycin were found in C. coli, but these differences
were not statistically signiﬁcant. There were no signiﬁcant
differences between Campylobacter species in levels of multi-
resistant isolates. Levels of resistance in isolates from fecal
samples showed similar patterns of resistance to isolates
from meat samples collected at the market, but the small
number of C. jejuni isolated from market samples made tests
for statistical signiﬁcance impossible.

Comparisons of patterns of resistance between hosts were
conducted with C. coli
isolates, which were present in
sufﬁcient numbers in both host species to allow statistical
analysis (Table 5). Isolates from pigs had signiﬁcantly higher
levels of resistance to azithromycin, clindamycin, erythro-
mycin, gentamicin, and tetracycline than those from chick-
ens. There were also higher levels of multi-resistant isolates
of C. coli from pigs compared to isolates collected from
chickens.

Discussion

Resistance to antimicrobial agents used in human therapy is
increasing in pathogenic Campylobacter and Escherichia coli
from animals (Aarestrup & Wegener, 1999). Antimicrobial
resistance in zoonotic foodborne pathogens increases the
burden of disease in humans by causing excess cases of
illness and increasing morbidity and mortality among cases
(Tollefson & Karp, 2004). The duration of illness was longer
for patients infected with quinolone-resistant Campylobac-
ter than those infected with susceptible strains (Engberg
et al., 2004). Both pork and chicken are major sources of
protein in Thailand, making the presence of resistant
bacteria in these food animal species a potential source of
zoonotic disease.

Antimicrobial use in both humans and animals may be
the most important factor for the development of bacteria
with increased resistance and virulence (Dancer, 2004).
Bacteria exposed to antimicrobial agents may evolve to
maintain survival, and the extent of resistance depends on
the amount, duration, and interaction of antimicrobial
agents and the bacterium (Yan & Gilbert, 2004). Modern
food animal production uses large amounts of antimicrobial
agents at subtherapeutic levels for growth promotion, which
provides favorable conditions for the spread and persistence
of antimicrobial-resistant zoonotic bacteria such as Campy-
lobacter (Aarestrup & Wegener, 1999). The use of anti-
microbials in animals in Thailand was only regulated by the
Thai Department of Livestock Development in 2003, and
not all farms in the country have met these new standards
for antimicrobial drug use. The use of antimicrobial agents
is unrestricted in Thailand, and many people will treat
diarrhea themselves with antimicrobial drugs.

The prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter
in our study, particularly the prevalence of resistance to
ﬂuoroquinolones, was relatively high compared to studies
conducted in the US (Gupta et al., 2004), Europe (Bywater

et al., 2004), and Japan (Ishihara et al., 2004). Several factors
may account
for these differences. While it has been
suggested that antimicrobial use in food animal production
may increase antimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter (Aar-
estrup & Wegener, 1999), other researchers have found that
ﬂuoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter may persist de-
spite the use of ﬂuoroquinolones (Zhang et al., 2003). The
effects of antimicrobial use on the proportion of antimicro-
bial-resistant Campylobacter on farms is unclear; associa-
tions were found between organic (no/limited antimicrobial
use) or conventional farm management and the proportion
of resistance in a poultry farm in one study (Avrain et al.,
2003), but no associations were seen in another study of
organic and conventionally managed dairy farms (Sato
et al., 2004).

The differences in patterns of antimicrobial resistance
seen between different species in this study may be due to
several factors. Since exposure to antimicrobial agents aids
the development of resistance to speciﬁc agents in bacteria
(Aarestrup & Wegener, 1999), differences in the types of
drugs used to treat different food animal species would
create preferential selection pressures for any enteric organ-
isms present in the host. In the current study, chickens were
exposed to drugs such as amprolium, sulfamethoxazole, and
enroﬂoxacin prior to their entry on study farms. Pigs were
given lincomycin and tylosin before they entered the study.
Resistance to the ﬂuoroquinolones ciproﬂoxacin and nali-
dixic acid was seen in C. coli from chickens in this study
(Table 5). In the case of pigs, exposure to one macrolide
(tylosin) may have resulted in the high levels of resistance to
another macrolide (erythromycin) seen in this study (Table
5). Also, antimicrobial concentrations may vary in different
segments of organs after administration, such that bacteria
may be subjected to uncertain selection pressures depending
on their location in the host (Yan & Gilbert, 2004).

In addition to differences in exposures to antimicrobial
agents, there were differences in the proportions of species
of Campylobacter (C. jejuni or C. coli) from different species
groups. One study in Japan demonstrated that a higher
proportion of C. coli than C.
jejuni were resistant to
aminoglycosides, macrolides, tetracycline and quinolones
(Ishihara et al., 2004). The differences in antimicrobial
susceptibility reported between C. jejuni and C. coli may
account for some of the differences seen between isolates
from pigs and chickens in this study.

In addition to the development of resistance, the spread
of resistant bacteria throughout the human food chain is
another concern, especially in cases where the proportions
of multiresistant isolates and isolates resistant to ciproﬂox-
acin and tetracycline were higher at the market than on the
farm or at slaughter (Table 3). Finding the highest levels of
antimicrobial resistance in samples from markets suggests
that, in addition to resistant Campylobacter arriving at the

market directly from the animals, cross-contamination may
be occurring at the marketplace itself. This is particularly
worrisome for samples from pork at the market, where over
50% of Campylobacter from these samples were multiresis-
tant. The practice of leaving raw pork and chicken in the
open air at the market would facilitate cross-contamnation
from environmental contaminants or from humans working
or shopping at the market. Measures could be taken at the
market to attempt to reduce cross-contamination to reduce
the spread of resistant isolates or transmissible resistance
factors.

In conclusion, this study has provided information about
the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter
from food animals at different stages in the chain from farm
to market, and from healthy adults and children with
diarrhea in Thailand. There were signiﬁcant differences in
the prevalence of resistant Campylobacter among animals at
the farm for all agents tested, and between sampling loca-
tions for most agents tested. The increased prevalence of
resistant isolates from meat samples collected at market,
compared to isolates collected from animals on the farm or
at the slaughterhouse, suggests that contamination of foods
of animal origin after carcasses leave the slaughterhouse is
an important factor in the spread of resistant bacteria to the
human food chain. Tracking changes in antimicrobial
susceptibility in Campylobacter from food animals and food
of animal origins was beyond the scope of this study;
however, these ﬁndings indicate areas where future research
can be targeted to identify speciﬁc factors to reduce the
prevalence of resistant bacteria entering the human food
supply.
