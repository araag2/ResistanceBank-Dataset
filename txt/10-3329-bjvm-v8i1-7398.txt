ABSTRACT 
   The  research  works  was  conducted  with  a  view  to  isolate  and  identify  the  Escherichia  coli  (E.  coli)  organism  from 
diarrhoeic cases of buffalo reared in selected areas of Bangladesh as well the prevalence and antibiotic sensitivity pattern of 
the  isolated  E.  coli  in  the  Department  of  Microbiology  and  Hygiene,  Bangladesh  Agricultural  University  (BAU), 
Mymensingh-2202 during the period from April 2008 to May 2009. A total of 50 rectal swab samples were collected from 4 
different places namely Haluaghat and Boira of Mymensingh, Madupur of Tangail and Kazipur of Sirajgonj districts. The 
samples were aseptically carried to the laboratory of the Department of Microbiology and Hygiene and subjected to different 
cultural, morphological and biochemical examinations. Upon cultural, morphological and biochemical examinations 23 (45%) 
samples were found to be positive for E. coli. The highest prevalence was found in Haluaghat, Mymensingh (53.33%) and the 
lowest  (40.00%)  in  Boira,  Mymensingh  and  Kazipur,  Sirajganj.  Antibiogram  study  revealed  that  the  isolated  E.  coli  was 
highly  sensitive  to  Enrofloxacin  and  Ciprofloxacin,  moderately  sensitive  to  Cefalexin  and  Amoxicillin,  and  resistant  to 
Nalidixic acid and Erythromycin. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
   The livestock sector in Bangladesh plays an important role in the national economy with the direct contribution 
of 2.79% in 2007-2008 to the agricultural GDP1. It generates more than 6 percent of the total foreign exchange 
earning through export of hide and skins, leather products, bones, hooves, edible offal. The estimated buffalo 
population  is  1.26  million  in  2007-2008.  It  provides  meat  and  milk  for  human  consumption  as  high  quality 
protein, hides and draft power for ploughing, rural road and farm power transport, threshing, oil seed crushing, 
dung as fuel and manure (BER, 2008). 
   Buffalo calves are vulnerable to E. coli infection. Two age groups appear to be susceptible, buffalo calves of 1-
2 days of age and buffalo calves of 3-8 weeks old. Symptoms include diarrhoea, a rise in temperature, weakness 
and lack of appetite. This is soon followed by coma and death within a few hours. In older animals there is a 
tendency of infection to localize itself in the joints of survivors. Lesions include enlarged, haemorrhagic spleens, 
and the accumulation of synovial fluid and sometimes pus in affected joints (Blood et al., 1968).   
   Escherichia  coli  (E.  coli)  is  Gram-negative,  rod-shaped,  flagellated,  motile,  oxidase  negative,  facultative 
anaerobe and is classified under the family Enterobacteriaceae (Buxton and Fraser, 1977). E. coli is genetically 
the  most  versatile  bacteria  and  is  the  source  of  many  plasmid  and  phage  mediated  genes  (Saylers  and  Whitt, 
2002). E. coli produces septicemia and diarrhoea in a wide range of hosts including man, avian and animals such 
as cattle, piglets, kids, foals, lambs and buffaloes.  
   Pathogenicity of E. coli strains are due to the presence of one or more virulence factors including invasiveness 
factors like invasins, heat labile, heat stable enterotoxins, verotoxins and colonization factors or adhesins (Smith, 
1967). Pathogenic E. coli are divided into two types- Enteropathogenic E. coli and Uropathogenic E. coli. Further 
pathogenic  E.  coli  are  grouped  into  enterotoxigenic  E.  coli  (ETEC),  enteropathogenic  E.  coli  (EPEC), 
enteroinvasive  E.  coli  (EIEC),  enteroaggregative  E.  coli  (EAggEC),  enterohemorrhagic  E.  coli  (EHEC). 
Uropathogenic E. coli cause 90% of the urinary tract infection. The bacteria colonize from the faeces or perineal 
region and ascend the urinary tract to the bladder (Carter, 1986). The ETEC strains are known to produce two 
types  of  enterotoxins  (Smith  and  Gyles,  1970).  One  type  is  characterized  by  having  larger  molecular  weight, 
heat-labile (LT) and possesses immunogenic quality. This type causes delayed onset of secretory response on 
intestinal  mucosa  which  persists for a longer  duration. The  second type is of smaller  molecular weight, heat-
stable (ST) toxin that is apparently nonimmunogenic (Smith and Gyles, 1970).

   E. coli in buffalo is isolated, identified and characterized using cultural, staining, biochemical, serological and 
molecular  techniques  in  the  whole  world.  In  Bangladesh  E.  coli  organisms  were  isolated  identified  and 
characterized  from  various  hosts  like  Chicken,  Duck,  Sheep,  Goat,  and  Cattle  by  Choudhury  et  al.,  1967; 
Rahman, 1987; Amin et al., 1988; Hossain, 2002 and Nazir, 2004. Isolation, identification and characterization 
of  E.  coli  of  Buffalo  in  Bangladesh  still  remain  untouched.  The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  determine  the 
prevalence  of  E.  coli  in  faecal  samples  of  diarrhoeic  buffalo  calves  and  establish  their  antibiotic  sensitivity 
profile.  
 
MATERIAL AND METHODS 
   The research work was conducted in the Department of Microbiology and Hygiene, Bangladesh Agricultural 
University (BAU), Mymensingh-2202 during the period of April 2008 to May 2009.  
 
Collection and transportation of samples  
   A total number of 50 field samples comprising rectal swabs from diarrhoeic buffalo calves (1week to 1 year of 
age) were aseptically collected into nutrient broth (NB) from different areas and carried to the Department of 
Microbiology  and  Hygiene,  BAU  in  ice  box.    The  samples  were  collected  from  three  different  places  in 
Bangladesh, namely, Haluaghat and Boira of Mymensingh district, Madupur of Tangail district and Kazipur of 
Sirajgonj district. 
 
Cultural and biochemical examination of samples 
   The collected samples were cultured onto different cultural media like nutrient agar (NA), Eosin Methylene 
Blue (EMB) agar, Salmonella-Shigella (SS) agar, MacConkey (MC) agar, Brilliant Green (BGA) agar and blood 
agar (BA) following procedure described by Cheesbrough, 1984; Carter, 1986 and Cowan, 1985. Upon cultural 
examination the isolated organism was subjected to different biochemical tests - sugar fermentation test, indole 
production  test,  Methyl  Red  –Voges  Proskauer  (MR-VP)  test,  Citrate  utilization  test  following  the  method 
described by Chessbrough, 1984. 
 
Preservation of E. coli isolates  
   The pure culture was stored in sterilie 80% glycerin and was used as stock culture. The equal volume of 80% 
glycerin and bacterial culture were mixed and capped tightly and stored at -200C. The isolated organisms were 
given code name for convenience. 
 
Comparative antimicrobial sensitivity pattern of Escherichia coli isolates 
   Susceptibility and resistance of different antibiotics was measured in vitro by employing the modified Kirby-
Bauer method (Bauer et al., 1966). The antimicrobial agent used with their disc concentration is mentioned in 
Table 1.

Isolation and characterization of Escherichia coli from 

 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
   Isolation and identification results of the study indicated that the field sample contained Gram negative, rod 
shape  and  motile  organism  with  various  colony  characteristics  (large,  smooth,  round  and  sticky)  in  different 
bacteriological media. The isolate was able to produce characteristic black metallic sheen colonies on EMB agar, 
pink  colony  on  MC  agar,  pinkish  colony  on  SS  agar,  circular,  raised,  smooth,  colorless  colony  on  NA  and 
greenish yellowish colonies in BG agar as  well. The colony characteristics of the isolated E. coli in different 
media  resemble  the  colony  characteristics  of  E.  coli  as  stated  by  Escherich,  1885  and  Ali  et  al.,  1998.  They 
reported  that  the  faecal  isolates  showed  various  colony  characteristics  and  biochemical  reactions  in  different 
bacteriological agar media.  
   The pattern of fermentation reaction by the isolated E. coli with five basic sugars was observed. The organism 
was  able  to  ferment  lactose,  dextrose  and  mannitol,  sucrose  and  maltoses  completely.  The  results  of  sugar 
fermentation partially agree with the findings of Beutin et al., 1993 and Sandhu et al., 1996. They reported that 
although  E.  coli  ferments  all  five  basic  sugars  but  it  partially  ferments  sucrose  and  maltose.  Variation  of  the 
results may be due to genetic factors and nature of inhabitant of the organisms.  All the isolates were found to be 
positive in catalase, methyl-red positive and Indole but negative to VP test which supports the findings of Beutin 
et al., 1993. 
   Among the isolated organisms, the highest prevalence was found in Haluaghat, Mymensingh (53.33%) and the 
lowest  (40.00%)  in  Boira,  Mymensingh  and  Kazipur,  Sirajganj  (Table  2).  The  prevalence  of  E.  coli  partially 
coincides with the findings of Islam  et al. 2008. They reported the prevalence of E. coli in buffalo is 37.9%.

   From  antibiogram  study  it  was  found  that  E.  coli  was  highly  sensitive  to  Enrofloxacin,  Ciprofloxacin, 
moderately sensitive to Cefalexin and Amoxicillin, and resistant to Nalidixic acid and Erythromycin (Table 3) 
which supports the findings of Nazir et al., 2004. 
Finally, from the findings of different cultural, staining, biochemical examinations it may be concluded that the 
isolated organism was E. coli.
