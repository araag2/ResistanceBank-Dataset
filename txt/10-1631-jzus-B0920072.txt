Abstract:    This study was conducted to determine genetic diversity and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of Staphylococcus 
aureus recovered from bovine mastitis in Zhejiang Province, China. Out of 3178 quarter milk samples from 846 lactating cows, 
among which 459 cows (54.3%) were found HMT positive, 890 quarters (28%) were found having subclinical mastitis. From 75 
representative S. aureus isolates, 16 distinct types were identified by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Four major PFGE 
types (A, B, C, and D) accounted for 82.7% of all isolates, and type A (41.3%) was observed in multiple herds across the studied 
areas. Each region was found to have a predominant type: Hangzhou type A (64.1%), Ningbo type C (34.5%) and type B (23.1%), 
Jinhua type D (53.3%), and Taizhou type C (62.5%). Results of antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed that 90.7% of the isolates 
were resistant to at least one antimicrobial. Resistance to penicillin and ampicillin (77.3%), tetracycline (60.0%), or erythromycin 
(48.0%) was observed. The bacteria resistant to multiple antibiotics such as penicillin, ampicillin, tetracycline, and erythromycin 
were commonly found. The information obtained from this study is useful for designing specific control programs for bovine S. 
aureus mastitis in this region. 

2004). One of the most important causes of bovine 
subclinical  mastitis  is  the  intramammary  infection 
(IMI)  caused  by  Staphylococcus  aureus,  which  is 
difficult to eradicate (Østeras et al., 2006; Ferguson 
et al., 2007).  

Genetic  characterization  of  mastitis-causing  S. 
aureus isolates is vital for an effective mastitis control 
program, especially for developing a vaccine against 
S. aureus. With the development of molecular biol-
ogy  techniques,  microbiologists  have  more  choices 
for epidemiologic typing of S. aureus isolates at the 
present time. A discriminatory and reliable molecular 
typing method for the identification of bacterial iso-
lates  at  strain  level  is  the  pulsed-field  gel  electro-
phoresis (PFGE) (Tenover et al., 1995; Peacock et al., 

 

INTRODUCTION 

infectious  disease 

 
Bovine mastitis is a complex and economically 
important 
for  dairy  cattle 
throughout the world, which can result in substantial 
losses due to reduced milk yield, and increase culling 
rates  and  veterinary  expenses  (Miles  et  al.,  1992). 
Subclinical mastitis, without any signs of inflamma-
tion compared with clinical mastitis, is the main form 
of the disease, and accounts for the majority of bo-
vine  mastitis  cases  in  dairy  herds  (Oliver  et  al.,

2002),  which  has  successfully  been  used  by  many 
researchers  in  the  field  of  molecular  subtyping  of 
mastitis-causing S. aureus (Fueyo et al., 2005; Haveri 
et al., 2007; Rabello et al., 2005; Sabour et al., 2004). 
So far, however, there is little literature available on 
this field in China. 

As  a  remedy  antimicrobials  are  used  very  fre-
quently  for  infectious  diseases  on  dairy  farms 
(Kaneene  and  Miller,  1992;  Sandgren  et  al.,  2008), 
but  the  therapeutic  outcome  of  S.  aureus  causing 
disease is poor, in part due to the versatile ability of 
the pathogen (Archer, 1998; Owens et al., 1988; Sol 
et al., 2000). Therefore, selection of a more effective 
drug  for  staphylococcal  mastitis  therapy  by  the 
evaluation of antimicrobial resistance may become a 
reality to clinical veterinarians.  

Dairy cattle are economically important animals 
in  Zhejiang  Province,  China.  There  are  four  major 
dairy farming regions that constitute over 80% of the 
dairy  cow  population  in  this  province.  To  our 
knowledge, no study has been performed to investi-
gate genetic diversity and antimicrobial susceptibility 
profiles  among  S.  aureus  isolates  recovered  from 
bovine  mastitis  in  this  area.  The  objectives  of  the 
present study, therefore, were to estimate the preva-
lence of bovine mastitis, compare genetic relatedness 
and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of S. aureus 
isolated from mastitic milk from different regions of 
Zhejiang Province in order to provide a useful guide 
for veterinary practice in the treatment of S. aureus 
mastitis,  and  design  mastitis  control  strategies  di-
rected to specific strains.   

 
 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Prevalence  of  subclinical  mastitis  and  Staphylo-
coccus aureus 

The study was conducted in the period of April 
2007 to June 2008 in four major dairy farming regions 
of  Zhejiang  Province,  namely,  Hangzhou,  Jinhua, 
Ningbo, and Taizhou. To achieve representative dis-
tribution of parameters concerning size, location, and 
milking  mode  across  the  province,  data  were  col-
lected  from  30  dairy  farms.  The  herd  structure  was 
characterized by large-scale state-owned dairy farms 
and smallholder farms varied from 1200 to 20 cows 
per  herd  and  the  Chinese  Holstein  cow  breed  com-

prised the majority of cows. A total of 3178 quarter 
milk samples from 846 lactating cows without clini-
cal signs of mastitis were investigated. 

Analysis of milk samples 

The  incidence  of  subclinical  mastitis  was  de-
termined at cow and quarter levels based on indirect 
tests (Hangzhou mastitis test (HMT)). Mastitic paddle 
wells  were  used  to  collect  milk  from  individual 
quarters, ensuring that the premilk was discarded. The 
procedures  and  the  interpretation  were  performed 
using HMT test according to Hu et al.(1990). Samples 
with an HMT score of 0 or 1 were considered nega-
tive. Cows with an HMT score ≥1+ in one quarter but 
without clinical signs of mastitis were considered to 
have subclinical mastitis. Aseptic collection of quar-
ter milk samples with HMT score of 2 or 3 were car-
ried out for bacteriological assay.  

Identification of S. aureus was done according to 
the  standard  routine  (National  Mastitis  Council, 
1999) and confirmed by the API STAPH® identifica-
tion system.  

After  the  investigation,  2~10  S.  aureus  strains 
for  a  herd  were  randomly  chosen  for  antimicrobial 
susceptibility  test  and  genotyping  according  to  epi-
demiological distribution across the province, taking 
the size, location, and milking mode of the farms into 
consideration. 

 

 

Antimicrobial susceptibility test 

The  disk  diffusion  method,  an  in  vitro  antim-
icrobial  susceptibility  test  of  the  S.  aureus  isolates, 
was performed according to the guideline of the Na-
tional  Committee  for  Clinical  Laboratory  Standards 
(NCCLS, 2002). The antimicrobial agents tested were 
selected based on two factors, the recommendation of 
NCCLS  and  the  actual  veterinary  practice,  and  in-
cluded ampicillin (10 µg/disk), cefoxitin (30 µg/disk), 
cefalotin (30 µg/disk), chloramphenicol (30 µg/disk), 
erythromycin (15 µg/disk), gentamicin (10 µg/disk), 
oxacillin  (1  µg/disk),  penicillin  G  (10  IU/disk),  tet-
racycline  (30  µg/disk),  clindamycin  (2  µg/disk), 
ciprofloxacin  (5  µg/disk),  and  vancomycin  (30 
µg/disk). Results were recorded as sensitive and re-
sistant.  Antimicrobial  disks  were  purchased  from 
Tianhe  (Tianhe  microbial  reagent  Co.,  Ltd.,  Hang-
zhou, China). The strain S. aureus ATCC 25923 was 
used as the control strain. 

Molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis 
Molecular typing of S. aureus isolates was per-
formed  using  restriction  enzyme  SmaI  (TaKaRa 
Corp., Japan) and subsequent PFGE according to the 
method of McDougal et al.(2003). PFGE was run on 
the  CHEF  Mapper  (Bio-Rad,  Hercules,  CA,  USA) 
using 1% (w/v) SeaKem Gold agarose (Cambrex Bio 
Science, Rockland, ME, USA) with 0.5× Tris-borate- 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic  acid  (EDTA)  (1  mol/L 
Tris, 0.01 mol/L EDTA, and 1 mol/L boric acid) as 
running  buffer.  A  Salmonella  serotype  Braenderup 
strain (H9812) digested with XbaI was used as size 
standards, which were run in the first, middle, and last 
lanes of each gel. The electrophoresis conditions were 
as follows: 14 °C, 120° ramp angle, 5 s to 40 s pulse 
time, 19 h at 6 V/cm. 

Macrorestriction bands were analyzed by using 
visual  judgment  according  to  criteria  proposed  by 
Tenover  et  al.(1995)  and  using  the  BioNumerics 
software  (Applied  Maths,  Kortrijk,  Belgium)  with 
Dice  coefficients.  Similarity  was  calculated  on  a 
dendrogram using the unweighted-pair group method 
with  arithmetic  means.  Position  tolerance  and  opti-
mization were set at 1.2% and 1.0%, respectively. A 
similarity coefficient of 80% was selected to define 
the pulsed-field type clusters. 

Incidence of subclinical intramammary infections 
and frequency of Staphylococcus aureus infection 
in four different regions 

From a total of 846 clinically healthy lactating 
cows, 459 (54.3%) were found with 1 or more quar-
ters HMT positive. Out of 3178 quarters, 890 (28.0%) 
were HMT positive. The highest prevalence in cow 
and quarter levels was found to be 69.7% and 36.4%,

respectively in Ningbo. The prevalence of subclinical 
mastitis at cow and quarter levels in different regions 
is presented in detail in Table 1. 

Rates of S. aureus detected from quarters with 
HMT score of 2 or 3 varied greatly in different re-
gions  (Table  1).  The  overall  prevalence  of  this 
pathogen was 12.2% ranging from 3.3% to 27.9% in 
different regions. S. aureus IMIs were identified in 23 
(76.7%) out of the 30 farms investigated. A total of 
108 S. aureus isolates were recovered from mastitic 
milk. Subsequently, 75 representative S. aureus iso-
lates  were  submitted  to  antimicrobial  susceptibility 
test and genotyping. 

Antimicrobial susceptibility  

The test was performed in a satisfactory manner 
when  the  quality  control  strains  produced  values 
within the established ranges. Antimicrobial suscep-
tibility  of  12  antimicrobial  agents  against  75  repre-
sentative S. aureus isolates from 4 different regions is 
presented in Table 2. Seven isolates (9.3% of total) 
were susceptible to all drugs tested. The remaining 68 
isolates  (90.7%)  were  resistant  to  at  least  1  antim-
icrobial  class.  S.  aureus  isolates  were  observed 
mostly resistant to penicillin and ampicillin (77.3%), 
while it appeared non-resistant to cefalotin and van-
comycin throughout the region. The proportion of S. 
aureus  isolates  resistant  to  gentamicin,  chloromy-
cetin,  clindamycin,  tetracycline,  and  erythromycin 
varied greatly among the four regions. Nevertheless, 
oxacillin  and  cefoxitin  exhibited  minimum  antibac-
terial-resistance to all the strains tested. Resistance to 
multiple  antibiotics  such  as  penicillin,  ampicillin, 
tetracycline, and erythromycin was common among 
the  bacterial  isolates.  Six  major  resistance  patterns 
were  observed  among  the  isolates:  no  resistance 
(pattern  I:  9.3%),  penicillin/ampicillin  resistance 
(pattern II: 21.3%), penicillin/ampicillin/tetracycline/

isolates belonged to patterns II and III. In addition, 2 
or 3 predominant resistance patterns were noticeable 
in each of the regions analyzed. 
 
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis 

Of the 75 representative S. aureus isolates col-
lected from 23 herds in the 4 regions, PFGE can type 
all of the isolates, and 39 distinct PFGE patterns were 
identified (Fig.1). According to genetic relationships, 
the  39  PFGE  patterns  were  assigned  to  16  lineage 
groups, designated as pulsed-field types with a capital 
letter, and patterns within these lineages were repre-
sented  by  designations  with  numeric  suffixes.  The 
dendrogram  in  Fig.1  demonstrates  the  banding  pat-
terns  and  genetic  relationships.  Four  major  types 
represented  82.7%  of  all  isolates.  Being  the  largest 
group among the 75 isolates, type A accounted for 31 
(41.3%) of all of the isolates, which were distributed 
in multiple herds across the 4 regions. Different types 
predominated in each region, observed as: Hangzhou 
type A (64.1%), Ningbo type C (34.5%) and type B 
(23.1%), Jinhua type D (53.3%), and Taizhou type C 
(62.5%).  

Nearly  two  thirds  of  the  herds  with  S.  aureus

Subclinical mastitis is hard to detect and is the 
main form of mastitis (Oliver et al., 2004; Pitkala et 
al., 2004). In China, many researchers reported that 
40%~80%  of  lactating  dairy  cows  in  most  farms 
suffer  from  subclinical  mastitis  (Pan  et  al.,  1996; 
Zhang et al., 2005). The present study shows a high 
prevalence  of  subclinical  mastitis  in  dairy  cows  in 
Zhejiang  Province  identified  by  HMT,  a  qualitative 
measurement  of  the  somatic  cell  count  in  milk  that 
can be easily used at cow side. The overall prevalence 
of subclinical mastitis in this study was 54.3% on cow 
basis  and  28.0%  on  an  udder  quarter basis.  Among 
different regions, the prevalence ranged from 40.8% 
to  69.7%  on  cow  basis  and  21.8%  to  36.4%  on  an 
udder quarter basis. The results are consistent with the

previous findings of Zhang et al.(2005), who reported 
a prevalence of 48.1% and 22.4% in cow and quarter 
in Jinhua, a region of Zhejiang Province. The varia-
tion  in  prevalence  of  mastitis  observed  among  the 
four regions in the present investigation may be due to 
differences in husbandry condition and management, 
as  well  as  a  lack  of  a  mastitis-control  program  in 
certain areas.  

As a major contagious pathogen associated with 
bovine  mastitis,  S.  aureus  frequently  causes  sub-
clinical chronic infections of the mammary gland in 
dairy cows (Østeras et al., 2006; Wilson et al., 1997).

In United Kingdom, with the implementation of the 
Five-Point Plan there has been a dramatic decrease in 
the  prevalence  of  contagious  mastitis  pathogens, 
especially  for  S.  aureus,  from  67  quarter  case/100 
cows per year in 1967 to 2.2 quarter case/100 cows 
per year in 1998 (Bradley, 2002). In China, however, 
S. aureus isolates have been reported to be involved 
in  about  10%~50%  of  mastitic  milk  samples  from 
dairy cows (Hu et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2007). In the 
current study, our results demonstrate that 76.7% of 
the  examined  herds  suffered  from  S.  aureus  infec-
tion, and the overall prevalence of this pathogen is 
12.2% in quarter milk samples with HMT score of 2 
or 3. It is worth to note, however, that the prevalence 
of  S.  aureus  can  vary  greatly  among  different  re-
gions,  ranging  from  27.9%  to  3.3%  in  the  present 
investigation. 

Bacterial resistance has been reported for more 
than 30 years and S. aureus is the most extensively 
studied  pathogen  in  dairy  diseases  (Lowy,  2003). 
Many  authors  had  reported  resistant  strains  in  S. 
aureus  isolated  from  bovine  mastitis  in  different 
countries (Moroni et al., 2006; Gentilini et al., 2000; 
de  Oliveira  et  al.,  2000).  In  our  study,  the  rate  of 
resistant strains was high (90.7%), and resistance to 
penicillin  G  and  ampicillin  (77.3%)  was  the  most 
frequently observed. This is in a good agreement with 
the results reported by Wang et al.(2007) and Liu et 
al.(2007), regarding S. aureus isolated from mastitis 
infected cows in China, but much higher than those 
reported  for  S.  aureus  strains  isolated  from  bovine 
mastitic  milk  in  Europe  and  the  United  States  (de 
Oliveira  et  al.,  2000).  Intensive,  empirical  or  inap-
propriate use of antimicrobial drugs as a treatment for 
dairy diseases may be a plausible explanation for the 
higher  antibiotics  resistance  in  S.  aureus  in  China. 
This is further confirmed by the lower levels of re-
sistance  reported  in  Nordic  countries,  such  as  Den-
mark  and  Norway,  where  strict  antimicrobial  man-
agement  policy  is  existing  in  veterinary  practices 
(Pitkala et al., 2004). To our knowledge, clindamycin 
and  chloromycetin  are  rarely  used  to  treat  bovine 
mastitis  in  Zhejiang  Province,  but,  surprisingly,  re-
sistance to these antimicrobial agents was observed. 
Perhaps, intensive use of these antimicrobial agents as 
a therapy for other infectious diseases in dairy farms 
can be attributed to this resistance; therefore, consid-
erable attention is needed in the future.

The emergence of multi antimicrobial-resistance 
is usually observed among bovine isolates (Gentilini 
et  al.,  2000;  Waage  et  al.,  2002).  In  Shitandil  and 
Sternesjö (2004)’s study, 34.3% and 18.0% S. aureus 
isolates  recovered  from  small  and  large  farms,  re-
spectively, developed resistance to two or more an-
timicrobial  drugs.  Resistance  to  penicillin  and  am-
picillin  was  also  common  in  other  countries  (de 
Oliveira et al., 2000). The present study shows that 
more than 80% of S. aureus strains were resistant to 
more  than  one  antimicrobial  agent  tested,  and  the 
predominant pattern was simultaneously resistant to 
penicillin, ampicillin, tetracycline, and erythromycin, 
which is consistent with the findings of Wang et al. 
(2007).  Those  antimicrobial  drugs  are  the  largest 
group involving the treatment of infectious diseases 
in dairy farms in China. The current study shows that 
variation for antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of S. 
aureus also exists in different regions, which may be 
associated with complicated reasons, such as different 
habits of clinical veterinary in selection of therapeutic 
drugs.  These  results  may  provide  important  knowl-
edge for the development of effective control strate-
gies for S. aureus mastitis in Zhejiang Province. 

PFGE is considered to be the ‘gold standard’ for 
molecular typing of pathogenic bacteria regarding its 
discriminatory  ability,  reproducibility,  and  typeabil-
ity, which has been recommended to type S. aureus 
isolates (Weller, 2000). In this study, genetic diversity 
of 75 representative S. aureus isolates recovered from 
different regions in Zhejiang Province was examined 
by  PFGE.  This  may  be  the  first  time  that  PFGE  is 
used in this field in China. For the genetic diversity of 
mastitis-causing  S.  aureus,  some  investigations  re-
vealed  that  some  predominant  strains  can  exist  in 
different dairy farms, even in different countries (Fox 
et al., 1991; Smith et al., 2005). On the contrary, Joo 
et al.(2001) reported that S. aureus types associated 
with  IMI  were  much  more  likely  to  be  unique  to  a 
herd than to be found in multiple herds. In the current 
study, type A was represented by 41.3% of isolates 
analyzed and was recovered from a number of herds, 
which is consistent with the findings of Smith et al. 
(2005).  Accordingly,  it  can  be  inferred  that  some 
strains prevailing among herds, even in different re-
gions, have some advantages of infecting due likely to 
special combination of virulence factors. On the other 
hand, nearly two thirds of herds with S. aureus infec-

tion had a unique type, which is in agreement with the 
results reported by Joo et al.(2001). Therefore, both 
situations  may  exist  simultaneously.  Geographical 
variation in the distribution of major prevalent types 
was also noted among different regions in the current 
investigation.  So,  comparison  of  predominant  and 
minor strains in different regions or herds can be an 
important  preliminary  study  for  a  successful  herd 
autogenous  S.  aureus  vaccination  program.  Further 
studies are needed to elucidate potential combination 
of virulence factors that favor the advantages within 
particular geographical environment. 

An association between bovine mastitis-causing 
S. aureus PFGE type and antimicrobial susceptibility 
phenotypes  was  reported  by  Anderson  et  al.(2006). 
However,  in  our  study  agreement  between  antim-
icrobial  resistance  patterns  and  particular  S.  aureus 
PFGE types was not observed for most isolates, ex-
cept that tetracycline resistance was not found in type 
C.  Disparate  results  may  be  derived  from  a  much 
higher degree of resistance of S. aureus isolates in our 
study. 

In conclusion, the present study describes the S. 
aureus genotypes responsible for the mastitis cases in 
different dairy regions of Zhejiang Province, China. 
This information might help in formulating strategies 
to  alleviate  S.  aureus  mastitis.  Furthermore,  antim-
icrobial susceptibility test of S. aureus could be used 
as a guide to select antimicrobials for the therapy of 
mammary infections.
