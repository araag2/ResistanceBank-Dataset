ABSTRACT 

The  aim  of  this  work  was  to  investigate  the  presence  of  Salmonella  spp.  in  300  beef  meat 

samples collected from cattle carcasses of different categories (young bulls, culled heifers and 

culled cows). The detection of Salmonella spp. was performed by the alternative VIDAS Easy 

Salmonella technique  and confirmed by PCR using  Salmonella specific primers. Salmonella 

serotypes  were  determined  by  slide  agglutination  tests.  The  resistance  to  12  antibiotics  was 

determined  by  the  diffusion  method  on  Mueller-Hinton  agar  antibiotic  discs.  The  overall 

contamination  rate  of  beef  by  Salmonella  spp.  was  5.7%  (17/300).  This  rate  varied  from 

naught  (0/100)  in  bulls’  meat  to  14%  (14/100)  in  culled  cows’  meat  (p  <0.001).  The 

prevalence  of  Salmonella  spp.  was  higher  in  summer  and  in  cattle  with  digestive  disorders: 

chronic gastroenteritis (6/17), traumatic peritonitis (3/17) and intestinal obstruction (2/17) (p 

<0.0001). Of the 17  Salmonella isolates, 6 serotypes were identified, namely  S. Montevideo

S.  Brandenburg  (1/17)  (p<0.05).  Unlike  other  serotypes,  S.  Montevideo  was  present  during 

the whole year except winter. Almost all of the strains (16/17) were resistant to at least one of 

the  12  tested  antibiotics.  Multidrug-resistance  concerned  14/17  of  the  strains,  including 

Amoxicillin  (13/17),  Tetracycline  (12/17),  Streptomycin  (10/17)  and  Nalidixic  acid  (6/17). 

All the strains were sensitive to the association (Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid), Cefoxitin and 

Ceftazidime.  In addition, our study showed that all Salmonella strains (17) were positive for 

invasion gene invA and negative for the virulence gene spvC. Only one isolate (S. Kentucky) 

harboured the h-li virulence gene.

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT1. Introduction  

Salmonellosis  is  a  bacterial  disease  with  a  rising  prevalence  in  the  cattle  industry.  It  is 

frequent in calves of one to ten weeks age, but also reported in dairy and beef cattle (Randall, 

Cooles,  Osborn,  Piddock  &  Woodward,  2004).  Typical  clinical  signs  of  acute  Salmonella 

infection include fever associated to diarrhea. Infected animals can be asymptomatic and shed 

to  one  billion  Salmonella  a  day  in  their  feces  (Millemann,  1998).  Salmonellosis  is  a  major 

food-borne  disease  worldwide  (WHO,  2013).  The  pathogenicity  of  Salmonella  depends 

essentially  on  its  chromosomal  and/or  plasmatic  virulence  genes  (Okamoto,  Filho  &  Rocha, 

2009; Montero, Herrero & Rodicio, 2012). The chromosomal invA gene enables the invasion 

of  epithelial  cells  (Galan  and  Curtiss,  1989).  H-li  gene  is  involved  in  the  control  of  phase 

change and motility of Salmonella. In addition, h-li gene is required for optimal transcription 

of several genes of invasion (Millemann, 1998). The virulence plasmid spv genes play a role 

in  multiplication  of  Salmonella  in  its  host  cell  (Rotger  and  Casadesus,  1999),  increase  the 

severity  of  enteritis.  It  allows  both  infection  and  persistence  in  extra-intestinal  sites  (Libby, 

Lesnick & Guiney, 2000) and under hostile conditions (Valone & Muller, 1993). 

Ciprofloxacin  and  Cefotaxime  are  the  most  commonly  used  antibiotics  for  the  treatment  of 

invasive  Salmonella  infections  in  humans  (Su  Chiu  &  Ou,  2004;  Bertrand,  Weill  &  Vrints, 

2006; Whichard, Gay  & Cooper, 2007). However, multidrug resistant Salmonella strains are 

becoming  a real  worldwide threat  (Weill, Grimont  & Cloeckaert, 2006;  Bouchrif, Ennajii  & 

Timinouni, 2008). Since 2002 in Europe an emergence of ciprofloxacin–resistant Salmonella 

spp.  isolates  has  been  reported  in  travelers  returning  from  Northeast  and  Eastern  Africa 

(Collard,  Place  &  Denis,  2007).  In  African  countries,  multidrug-resistant  Salmonella  spp. 

strains exhibiting resistance to Ciprofloxacin have been reported in several studies (Aragaw, 

Molla,  Muckle  &  Poppe,  2007;  Bouchrif  et  al.,  2008;  Molla,  Berchau  &  Kleer,  2006).  For 

these reasons,  food-borne diseases  caused by  Salmonella spp. are  a significant  public health 

 

3 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTconcern around the world (Sire and Garin, 2008; Marrero-Ortiz, Han & Lynne, 2012). Non-

typhoid  serovars  are  increasing  in  importance  as  significant  pathogens  of  both  humans  and 

animals (Mukhopadhyay and Ramaswamy, 2012). Indeed, there are about 17 million cases of 

acute gastroenteritis or diarrhea annually due to non-typhoid salmonellosis causing 3 million 

deaths  (Rabsch,  Tschäpe  &  Baumler,  2001).  Over  1  million  cases  of  salmonellosis  are 

attributed  to  consumption  of  contaminated  foods  (meat,  eggs…)  each  year  in  the  United 

States  of  America  (Scallan,  Angullo  &  Roy,  2011).  The  most  common  serotypes  associated 

with human diseases in the U.S.A. are S. Typhimurium, Enteritidis, Newport, Heidelberg and 

Javiana (Scallan, Hoekstra, Angulo, Tauxe, Widdowson & Roy, 2011). Salmonella infections 

lead to approximately 19 000 cases of hospitalizations and nearly 400 deaths each year in the 

U.S.A.  (Scallan  et  al.,  2011),  with  an  economic  burden  due  to  lost  work,  increased  medical 

costs  and  deaths  (Scharff,  2010).  Undercooked  beef  is  the  most  involved  food  in 

gastroenteritis,  after  eggs  and  egg  products  (ANSES,  2011).  In  France,  35%  of  food-borne 

Salmonella  infections  were  attributable  to  the  consumption  of  undercooked  beef  mainly  in 

children  under  fifteen  (Gauchard  et  al.,  2002).  In  Tunisia,  Salmonella  food-borne  infections 

constitute an emerging public health problem (Ben Aissa, Troudi & Belhadj, 2007). The most 

frequently isolated serotypes, in 2010, were S. Enteritidis (45%) and S. Typhimurium (27%) 

(R.T.S.R.B.A, 2012). In 2011, two episodes of Salmonella food-borne infections occurred in 

South  Tunisia  following  the  consumption  of  beef;  it  caused  one  death  and  more  than  117 

clinical cases (Hamza, 2013).  

The deep  contamination  of meat  can be related to  either clinical  or  asymptomatic infections 

(Vieria-Pinto  &  Tenreiro,  2012).  This  phenomenon  is  increased  by  the  slaughtering  stress, 

especially  in  the  absence  of  respect  of  water  diet  and  the  animals’  rest  (Radostits,  Blood  & 

Hinchcliff, 2000). However, surface  meat  contamination occurs also during the slaughtering 

from the intestinal contents (Buncic and Sofos, 2012). This fecal contamination is due to poor 

 

4 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPThygiene during animal slaughtering. There is a high risk of beef meat deep contamination by 

Salmonella  spp.  especially  in  sanitary  culled  animals  (Labadie,  1999).  The  present  work 

aimed to on one hand estimate the prevalence of Salmonella meat deep contamination in both 

healthy bulls and culled females (heifers and cows) and on the other hand study the isolated 

Salmonella strains. 

 

2. Materials and methods 

2.1. Samples 

The  present  study  was  carried  out  during  the  four  seasons  from  September  2013  to  August 

2014;  it  concerned  a  total  number  of  300  beef  meat  samples  designated  to  human 

consumption  collected  in  Greater  Tunis  (Tunisia)  from  carcasses.  During  each  season,  75 

animals (25 bulls, 25 culled heifers and 25 culled cows) were sampled.  

Information about age, sex, disease history and cause of culling of the animals was collected. 

But, there is no information about the health care provided to the animals in their respective 

farms.  Bulls  were  healthy  at  the  day  of  slaughtering  but  culled  females  were  affected  by  at 

least one disease (chronic gastroenteritis, traumatic peritonitis, intestinal obstruction, chronic 

feet diseases, chronic mastitis…) (Table 1).  

Disposable sterile bags were used to collect approximately 100 g of meat from the inner parts 

of  iliopsoas  muscle.  The  meat  surface  was  sterilized  and  the  sample  was  transferred  to  a 

sterile stomacher bag.  

As recommended by Codex Alimentarius (1987), samples were stored at -18°C until used in 

the  Laboratory  of  Food  Microbiology  National  School  Veterinary  of  Medicine,  Sidi  Thabet 

(Tunisia).

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT2.2. Salmonella spp. VIDAS detection  

The  detection  of  Salmonella  spp.  by  alternative  VIDAS  Easy  Salmonella  (bioMérieux,  SA 

Marcy l’Ẻtoile, France) technique, was performed in four steps: primary enrichment, selective 

enrichment, VIDAS and confirmation (Cheung & Kam, 2012). Twenty five grammes of meat 

sample  were  homogenized  in  225  ml  of  Buffered  Peptone  Water  (Biokar  Diagnostics, 

Beauvais, France). The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 22 hours. A volume of 100 µL of 

media  was  transferred  to  10  ml  Salmonella  Xpress  broth  2  (SX2)  (bioMérieux  SA,  Marcy 

l’Étoile, France) and incubated at 41.5°C for 24 hours. One milliliter of the culture was heated 

for 15 minutes at 100°C then cooled at room temperature. A volume of 0.5 ml SX2 broth was 

transferred  into  a  SLM  array  and  deposited  in  the  VIDAS  (bioMérieux  SA,  Marcy  l’Étoile, 

France).  Confirmation  of  positive  samples  was  performed  by  isolation  of  Salmonella  from 

unheated SX2 broth on selective agar (XLD and SS) (Biokar Diagnostics, Beauvais, France) 

and  identification  by  urease  test  followed  by  API  20E  system  test  (bioMérieux  SA,  Marcy 

l’Étoile, France) according to ISO 6579, 2002 reference technique.  

 

2.3. Serotypes of Salmonella strains 

Serotypes  of  Salmonella  isolates  were  determined  by  slide  agglutination  tests  with  specific 

immune sera against O, H and Vi Salmonella antigens (BioRad, Marne-La-Coquette, France) 

at  the  National  Centre  for  Salmonella,  Shigella  and  Vibrio,  Pasteur  Institute  of  Tunis 

(Tunisia). The interpretation of the results was performed according to the White–Kauffmann-

Le Minor scheme (Popoff, Bockemühl, & Gheesling, 2001).  

 

2.4. Molecular study  

InnuPREP  DNA  Mini  Kit  (Biometra,  Les  Ulis,  France)  was  used  for  the  extraction  of 

Salmonella genomic DNA from the selective enrichment SX2 broth (bioMérieux SA, Marcy 

 

6 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTl’Étoile, France): one milliliter of SX2 broth was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 7500 rpm, the 

pellet  was  mixed  with  a  washing  solution  and  proteinase  K  (20  mg/ml).  The  mixture  was 

heated  at  50°C  for  10  minutes  then  centrifuged  at  12000  rpm  for  2  minutes.  The  pellet  was 

washed twice and DNA was eluted by a centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 1 minute then stored at      

-20°C until used. The molecular confirmation of Salmonella was carried out by performing a 

PCR  detecting  a    1  kb  DNA  fragment  (Karraouan,  Fassouane,  El  Ossmani,  Cohen,  & 

Bouchrif,  2010),  using 

specific  primers:  F-5'ACCACGCTCTTTCGTCTGG3'  and                 

R-5GAACTGACTACGTAGACGCTC3'  (Abouzeed,  Hariharana,  Poppeb,  &  Kibengea, 

2000). The invasion  gene  invA and virulence  genes  spvC and h-li respectively have sizes of 

275, 669 and 173 bp (Karraouan et al., 2010). All Salmonella isolated strains were tested for 

three  invasion  and  virulence  genes  (invA,  h-li  and  spvC)  using  three  specific  primers  sets:      

F-5'TATCGCCACGTTCGGGCAA3' 

and 

R-5'TCGCACCGTCAAAGGAACC3’,                 

F-5'AGCCTCGGCTACTGGTCTTG3' 

and 

R-5'CCGCAGCAAGAGTCACCTCA3’,            

F-5'CGGAAATACCATCAAATA3' 

and 

R-5'CCCAAACCCATACTTACTCTG3' 

respectively (Abouzeed et al., 2000).  

The PCR mixture consisted of 2.5 µL of 10x PCR buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl; pH 8.5; 50 mM 

KCl), 3 mM MgCl2, 0.4 mM of each dNTP, 25 µM of each primer, 1.25 U Taq Polymerase 

(Vivantis, Oceanside, USA), sterile distilled water and 2.5 µL of DNA template.  

The DNA amplification was performed using the following programme: 1 min denaturation at 

95°C, followed by 35 cycles (95°C for 20 s, 55°C for 20 s and 72°C for 2 min) and a final 

extension at 72°C for 4 min (Nayak, Stewart, & Wang, 2004). Amplification was performed 

in a thermocycler (Esco Swift Max Pro, Horsham PA, USA).  

PCR  products  were  electrophorised  in  1.5%  agarose  gel  and  visualized  with  ultraviolet 

transillumination after ethidium bromide staining. Negative and positive controls were added 

for each PCR run.

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT2.5. Antibiotic resistance 

Resistance test to 12 antibiotics was screened by the diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar 

antibiotic discs (BioRad, Marne-La-Coquette, France). Interpretation of the results was done 

according to the Clinical and Laboratory of Standards Institute criteria (CLSI, 2008).  

 

2.6. Statistical analyses 

The infection prevalence percentages were compared using Epi Info 6 (Dean et al., 2011) with 

Mantel Haenszel Chi-square test. Observed differences were considered significant when the 

p value was lower than 0.05 (Schwartz, 1993). 

 

2.7. Ethics statement 

The  study  was  performed  in  accordance  with  the  Memorandum  of  the  French  General 

Directorate of Food N°2012-8056 March 13, 2012 on the authorization of slaughterhouses to 

derogate from the requirement to stun animals.  

The experimental protocol was approved by the Tunisian Association of Laboratory Animals 

Sciences, Tunisia. The  restraint and slaughter of animals  were monitored and carried out  by 

trained and competent staff, in order to minimise animals’ suffering.  

All  the  stages  were  realized  under  the  responsibility  and  supervision  of  an  official  sanitary 

veterinarian.  

 

3. Results 

3.1. Prevalence of Salmonella spp. in beef  

The  deep  meat  contamination  prevalence  by  Salmonella  spp.  was  5.7%  (17/300).  The  17 

isolates  were  positive  to  PCR  using  Salmonella specific  primers  (Figure  1).  This  rate  varies 

from  naught  (0/100)  for  bulls’  meat  to  14%  (14/100)  for  culled  cows’  meat  (p  <0.001). 

 

8 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTSalmonella spp. beef  meat  prevalence  was higher  during the summer  season  (13.3%; 10/75) 

compared to winter (1.3%; 1/75) (p <0.05). 

A  total  number  of  6  serotypes  were  identified,  namely  S.  Montevideo  (8/17),  S.  Anatum 

(3/17),  S.  Minnesota  (2/17),  S.  Amsterdam  (2/17),  S.  Kentucky  (1/17)  and  S.  Brandenburg 

(1/17)  (p<0.05)  (Table  1).  Unlike  other  serotypes,  S.  Montevideo  was  present  during  the 

whole  year  except  winter.  It  showed  a  prevalence  peak  during  the  summer  season  (6.7%; 

5/75) (p <0.05) (Figure 1).     

Digestive  disorders  (chronic  gastroenteritis  (6/17),  traumatic  peritonitis  (3/17)  and  intestinal 

obstruction  (2/17))  were  significantly  related  to  Salmonella  spp.  meat  contamination             

(p <0.0001) (Table 1). Moreover, chronic feet diseases (4/17) and chronic mastitis (2/17) were 

factors for deep meat Salmonella spp. contamination.  

Prevalence  of  Salmonella  contamination  was  significantly  higher  in  culled  cows’  meat  with 

digestive disorders (23.5%; 8/34) compared to cows with chronic feet diseases (12.1%; 4/33) 

and cows with chronic mastitis (6.1%; 2/33) (p <0.001). 

 

3.2. Prevalence of pathogenic genes and antibiotic resistance   

Salmonella  strains  (17)  were  positive  for  invasion  gene  invA  and  negative  for  the  virulence 

gene spvC. Only one isolate (S. Kentucky) serotype was positive for h-li gene (Table 1, Figure 

3).  

Almost  all  (16/17)  of  the  strains  were  resistant  to  at  least  one  of  the  antibiotics.  Multi-

resistance concerned 14/17 of the strains, including Amoxicillin (13/17), Tetracycline (12/17), 

Streptomycin (10/17) and Nalidixic acid (6/17). Furthermore, all strains were sensitive to the 

association (Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid), Cefoxitin and Ceftazidime (Table 1).

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT4. Discussion 

The  results  of  our  study  showed  that  Salmonella  spp.  beef  contamination  rate  was  5.7% 

(17/300). It varies from naught (0/100) in bulls’ meat to 14% (14/100) in culled cows’ meat (p 

<0.001). Our results were comparable to those of Ben Jaafar, Jiridi, Fodha, & Salem, (2002) 

who  found  a  prevalence  of  4.2%  in  Tunisian  beef  meat  catering.  This  rate  was  lower  to  the 

results of Derouiche (2001) in Tunisia (9.3%). This difference could be explained by the fact 

that Derouiche collected samples from culled cattle.  

Our  study  revealed  that  the  contamination  prevalence  of  the  culled  cows’  meat  (14%)  was 

significantly  higher  than  that  of  culled  heifers  and  bulls’  meat  (3%  and  0%  respectively)  (p 

<0.001) (Table 1). This is likely due to the high prevalence of latent carriage in culled cows, 

immunodepression in some animals, the absence of water diet and fatigue before slaughtering 

(Labadie, 1999). 

Seasonal  Fluctuation  of  Salmonella  spp.  beef  meat  contamination  showed  a  significant 

difference  between  the  prevalence  of  Salmonella  spp.  during  the  summer  season  (13.3%; 

10/75)  and  winter  (1.3%;  1/75)  (p  <0.05).  Our  results  were  comparable  to  those  of  Ayaz, 

Ormeci, & Oz, (2010) who found a higher prevalence of Salmonella spp. in Turkish beef meat 

in summer than in other seasons. In Nepal, Maharjan, Vandana, Durga, & Poornima, (2006) 

indicated  that  the  seasonal  prevalence  of  Salmonella  spp.  in  beef  meat  was  highest  in  the 

months of April and May (summer season).   

Of the 17 Salmonella isolates, 6 serotypes were identified, namely, S. Montevideo (8/17), S. 

Anatum  (3/17),  S.  Minnesota  (2/17),  S.  Amsterdam  (2/17),  S.  Kentucky  (1/17)  and  S. 

Brandenburg  (1/17) (p < 0.05) (Table 1). Seasonal  distribution of  Salmonella spp. serotypes 

indicated that unlike other serotypes, S. Montevideo was present during the whole year except 

winter  and  peaking  during  the  summer  season  (6.7%;  5/75)  (p  <0.05)  (Figure  1).  S. 

Montevideo is frequently isolated from diarrhea cattle in France (AFSSA, 2006). Since 2000, 

 

10 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTS. Montevideo was the third most frequent serotype in cattle digestive diseases in France (7%) 

(AFSSA, 2006). However, our results do not agree with those of  Derouiche (2001) and  Ben 

Jaafar  et  al.  (2002)  who  revealed  the  predominance  of  S.  Anatum  (40%)  followed  by  S. 

Corvallis. S. Montevideo rate was 6% (Derouiche, 2001) but not isolated by Ben Jaafar et al. 

(2002). 

Our  study  did  not  reveal  the  presence  of  the  two  most  frequent  serotypes  involved  in 

collective food poisoning namely S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium. Ben Jaafar et al. (2002) 

showed  fairly  significant  levels  of  contamination  of  beef  with  S.  Enteritidis  and  S. 

Typhimurium  (12%)  but  Derouiche  (2001)  indicated  a  low  level  of  contamination  with  S. 

Enteritidis (4%) but no S. Typhimurium contamination was found.  

Digestive  disorders  (chronic  gastroenteritis  (6/17),  traumatic  peritonitis  (3/17)  and  intestinal 

obstruction (2/17)) were the main cattle disease history (Table 1). This is explained by the fact 

that  digestive  tract  disturbances  increase  Salmonella  absorption  from  the  intestinal  lumen 

(Labadie, 1999).  

Our study showed that all studied Salmonella strains (n = 17) were positive for invasion gene 

invA  and  negative  for  spvC  virulence  gene.  Only  one  isolate  (S.  Kentucky)  was  positive  for   

h-li  gene  (Table  1,  Figures  2  and  3).  Our  results  were  similar  to  those  of  Karraouan  et  al. 

(2010)  who  indicated  that  all  strains  (n  =  39)  of  Salmonella  were  positive  for  the  invasion 

gene invA. Several serotypes (Muenster, Newport, Corvallis, Albert, Bredeney, Hadar, Derby, 

Kiel, Altona and Infantis) were negative for both virulence genes spvC and h-li, while 4/8 of 

S. Kentucky serotype were positive for the gene h-li. Only S. Gallinarum was positive for the 

spvC virulence gene. Abouzeed et al. (2000) reported similar results about the invA gene in 75 

Salmonella strains from turkey meat, bovine and human samples. 

PCR  analysis  demonstrated  the  h-li  gene  in  only  one  of  the  17  isolates.  Karraouan  et  al. 

(2010) showed that 18% (7/39) of strains possess the h-li gene. The results of our study about

revealed  a  frequency  of  28%  spvC  gene  (21/75)  among  different  serotypes  of  Salmonella 

isolated from turkey meat, cattle and human disease samples. Our results were similar to those 

of Turki, Ouzari, &  Ben Aissa, (2012) who indicated that all strains  (n  = 57) of  Salmonella 

Kentucky isolated from different sources (animals, food and human cases) were negative for 

the spvC gene. 

As  it  was  reported  in  several  countries  (France,  Belgium,  Slovak  Republic,  Morocco,  and 

Ethiopia)  (Aragaw  et  al.,  2007;  Collard  et  al.,  2007;  Molla  et  al.,  2006),  we  noticed  a  high 

multidrug-resistance rate in Salmonella isolated from beef. 

Our study indicated that almost all (16/17) of the strains were resistant to at least one of the 12 

tested  antibiotics.  Multidrug-resistant  Salmonella  concerned  14/17  of  the  strains,  including 

Amoxicillin (13/17), Tetracycline (12/17), Streptomycin (10/17) and Nalidixic acid (6/17). In 

Tunisia, to our knowledge there is no published data on antimicrobial use in farm animals. In 

Tunisian  human  medicine  practice,  an  antibacterial 

treatment 

is  not 

indicated  for 

uncomplicated forms of Salmonella gastroenteritis. Quinolone therapy is reserved to clinically 

severe cases (Boutiba et al., 2007).  

Our  results  are  similar  to  those  from  the  study  of  Karraouan  et  al.  (2010)  which  studied 

antibiotic  resistance  of  39  Salmonella  isolates  from  turkey  meat  in  Morocco.  This  study 

showed that 82% (32/39) of the strains were resistant to at least one of the tested antibiotics, 

while the multidrug-resistant strains were present in 51.3% of the samples. High percentages 

of resistance were observed for Sulfonamides (64%), Tetracycline (39%), Amoxicillin (31%) 

and Nalidixic acid (36%). The rates of resistance against Amoxicillin and Tetracycline were 

high in Tunisian hospitals (54.5 and 40% respectively) (Boutiba et al., 2007).  

Furthermore,  our  study  showed  that  all  the  strains  were  sensitive  to  Amoxicillin  and 

Clavulanic acid  association and Cefoxitin. But,  Boutiba  et  al.  (2007) reported a high rate of 

 

12 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTresistance  against  third  generation  cephalosporin  in  Tunisian  hospitals  (33%).  Salmonella 

Kentucky was the most resistant serotype (9/12). Similar results were reported by Karraouan 

et al. (2010).  

 

4. Conclusion  

Our study revealed a low prevalence of Salmonella spp. meat contamination. This rate varied 

from  naught  for  bulls’  meat  to  14%  for  culled  cows’  meat.  In  addition,  the  prevalence  of 

Salmonella spp. was higher in summer and in cattle with digestive disorders. Six serotypes of 

Salmonella were identified; S. Montevideo was the most frequent, followed by S. Anatum, S. 

Minnesota,  S.  Amsterdam,  S.  Kentucky  and  S.  Brandenburg.  Unlike  other  serotypes,  S. 

Montevideo was present during the whole year exception winter. All Salmonella strains were 

positive for invasion gene invA and negative for spvC virulence gene. Only one (S. Kentucky) 

was  positive  for  h-li  gene.  Almost  all  of  the  strains  were  resistant  to  at  least  one  antibiotic. 

Multidrug-resistant  Salmonella  concerned  many 

serotypes, 

including  Amoxicillin, 

Tetracycline,  Streptomycin  and  Nalidixic  acid.  Salmonella  Kentucky  was  the  most  resistant 

serotype.  The  association  of  multidrug-resistance  and  invasion  gene  in  Salmonella  isolates 

justifies the need of surveillance system for both human and animal health sectors.
