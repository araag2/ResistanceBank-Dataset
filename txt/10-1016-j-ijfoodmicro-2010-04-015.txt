A total of 764 retail meat including 515 chicken, 91 pork, 78 beef and 80 lamb samples were collected in
Shaanxi Province of China in 2007–2008 to determine the prevalence of Salmonella. The isolates were
characterized using serotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and the presence of blaCMY-2 and blaTEM
and class I integrons. Selective serovars were further subtyped using PFGE. Approximately 54% (276) of
chicken, 31% (28) of pork, 17% (13) of beef and 20% (16) of lamb samples were positive of Salmonella. Among
24 serovars identiﬁed, Enteritidis (31.5%) was most common, followed by Typhimurium (13.4%), Shubra
(10.0%), Indiana (9.7%), Derby (9.5%) and Djugu (7.0%). Nearly 80% of the isolates (283) were resistant to at
least one antimicrobial, and 53% (191) to more than three antimicrobials. Resistance was most frequently
observed to sulfamethoxazole (67%), to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (58%) and to tetracycline (56%).
Furthermore, many isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid (35%), ciproﬂoxacin (21%) and ceftriaxone (16%).
Most isolates of Shubra (89%) and Indiana (88%) were resistant to ≥9 antimicrobials, compared to only 11%
of Enteritidis and 9% of Infantis that showed similar resistance. Class I integrons were detected in 10% of the
isolates, and contained aadA, tetR, dhfr, blaPSE-1, blaDHA-1 and blaVEB-1 gene cassettes alone or various
combinations. Ceftriaxone- and/or cefoperazone-resistant isolates (n =62) carried blaTEM (51.6%) and/or
blaCMY-2 (56.5%). A total of 116 PFGE patterns were generated among 210 selected isolates. Our ﬁndings
indicated that Salmonella contamination was common in retail meats, and that the Salmonella isolates were
phenotypically and genetically diverse. Additionally, many Salmonella isolates were resistant to multiple
antimicrobials.

1. Introduction

Foodborne diseases caused by nontyphoid Salmonella represent an
important public health problem worldwide. It is estimated that
approximately 70%–80% of
foodborne bacterial outbreaks were
caused by Salmonella in China (Wang et al., 2007). In the United
States, 164,044 Salmonella infections (approximately 32,000 annually)
were reported during 1998–2002 (Lynch et al., 2006). Pork, beef and
poultry/chicken meat have been recognized as signiﬁcant sources of
human salmonellosis (Magistrali et al., 2008). Currently, ceftriaxone is
the drug of choice for treating salmonellosis, especially in children
because of its pharmacodynamic properties and the very low
prevalence of resistance to the agent (Fey et al., 2000).

Although more than 2500 serovars of Salmonella enterica have
been identiﬁed, most human Salmonella infections are caused by a
limited number of serovars. S. enterica Typhimurium and Enteritidis
are the most common causes of human salmonellosis worldwide,
whereas serovars including Derby and Indiana have been reported to
be prevalent in certain foods and regions (Bangtrakulnonth et al.,
2004; Herikstad et al., 2002; Galanis et al., 2006; Xia et al., 2009).
Serotyping and pulse ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) are effective
surveillance tools to detect outbreaks,
identify outbreak source,
monitor trends over time, and attribute human disease to various
foods and animals (Galanis et al., 2006).

In the past 20 years, the emergence and spread of antimicrobial-
resistant Salmonella, particularly multidrug resistant (MDR) strains, is
one of major public health concerns, and most infections with MDR
Salmonella are acquired by eating contaminated foods of animal origin
(White et al., 2001). Recently, an alarming increase in MDR Salmonella
and the occurrence of emerging Salmonella serovars have been reported
in many European and Asian countries (Cailhol et al., 2006; Cui et al.,

2008; Hoge et al., 1998; Jones et al., 2002; Lauderdale et al., 2006; Pan
et al., 2009; Van et al., 2003; Xia et al., 2009). However, there is a paucity
on data regarding the prevalence, types of serovars, PFGE proﬁles and
antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella from retail meats in China.

In this study, we characterized Salmonella isolates recovered from
retail meats in 2007 and 2008 in Shaanxi Province, China. Our ﬁndings
indicated that Salmonella contamination in retail meats was common, and
that the Salmonella isolates were phenotypically and genetically diverse.
Many Salmonella isolates were resistant to multiple antimicrobials.

2. Materials and methods

2.4. Detection of class I integrons and resistance genes

Sulfamethoxazole-resistant Salmonella isolates were further
screened for the presence of class I integrons. In addition, isolates
that demonstrated resistance to the extended-spectrum ceftriaxone
and cefoperazone were examined for the presence of the extended-
spectrum β-lactamase genes blaCMY-2 and blaTEM. Class I integrons
were ampliﬁed with primers 5′-CS (5′-GGCATCCAAGCAGCAAGC-3′)
and 3′-CS (5′-AAGCAGACTTGACCTGAT-3′) using previously described
methods (Yang, et al., 2009). BlaCMY-2 and blaTEM were ampliﬁed as
previously described (Chen, et al., 2004; Hasman et al., 2005).

2.1. Isolation and identiﬁcation of Salmonella

2.5. PFGE

A total of 764 retail meat samples including 515 chicken, 91 pork, 78
beef and 80 lambs were collected monthly during 2007–2008 in
supermarkets and free markets in Xian, Yangling and Baoji, which are
located in the east, centre, and west, respectively, in Shaanxi Province,
China. The meat samples were tested for Salmonella using previously
described methods (Cui et al, 2006). Brieﬂy, 25 g of ground meat was
placed into a sterile glass ﬂask containing 225 ml of buffered peptone
water (BPW, Difco, Cockeysville, MD). For chicken carcasses, a whole
piece was placed in a plastic bag and washed with 400 ml BPW with
shaking vigorously for 2 min. The rinse was incubated at 37 °C in a water
bath with shaking at 100 rpm for 6 h. After the pre-enrichment, 10 ml
and 1 ml cultures were transferred to 100 ml each of the tetrathionate
(TT, Difco) and Rappaport–Vassiliadis (RV, Difco) broth, respectively. The
TT and RV broth were incubated at 42 °C in a water bath with shaking at
100 rpm for 24 h, followed by streaking TT onto xylose lysine tergitol 4
(XLT4, Difco) agar and RV onto xylose lysine desoxycholate (XLD, Difco)
agar. After incubation for 48 h at 35 °C, two of presumptive Salmonella
colonies were picked from each plate and stabbed into triple sugar iron
(TSI, Difco) and urea-agar (Difco) slants, respectively, incubated for 24 h
at 35 °C. Isolates with typical Salmonella phenotypes were conﬁrmed by
PCR using primers invAF (5′-GTGAAATTATCGCCACGTTCGGGCAA-3′) and
invAR (5′-TCATCGCACCGTCAAAGGAACC-3′). The PCR reaction was
carried out in a 25 μL PCR mixture containing 0.5 μM of each primer,
250 μM of dNTP, 1×PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 U of Taq DNA
polymerase (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) and 5 μL of sample DNA, using a
mycircle PCR system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with incubation at 94 °C for
10 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for
30 s, and a ﬁnal extension of 72 °C for 7 min. PCR products were stained
with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light after gel electro-
phoresis on 1% agarose.

2.2. Serotyping

All isolates were serotyped in Henan Center for Disease Control
and Prevention, Zhengzhou, Henan, China. O and H antigens were
characterized using slide agglutination with hyperimmune sera (S&A
Company, Thailand) and the serotype was assigned following the
manufacturer's instructions.

2.3. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Antimicrobial susceptibility proﬁles were determined via agar
dilution according to the standards and guidelines described by the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (Clinical and Labora-
tory Standards Institute, 2003). The following antimicrobials were
tested: amikacin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, ceftriaxone,
cefoperazone, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, ciproﬂoxacin, gentamicin,
kanamycin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline
and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and
ATCC 35218, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Staphylococcus aureus
ATCC 29213 were used as quality control organisms in antimicrobial
minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) determinations.

PFGE was performed according to the protocol developed by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Ribot et al., 2006).
Brieﬂy, agarose-embedded DNA was digested with 50 U of XbaI
(TaKaRa) for 1.5–2 h in a water bath at 37 °C. The restriction
fragments were separated by electrophoresis in 0.5×TBE buffer at
14 °C for 18 h using a Chef Mapper electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad)
with pulse times of 2.16–63.8 s. S. Braenderup H9812 was used as the
control strain. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide, and DNA
bands were visualized with UV trans-illumination (Bio-Rad). PFGE
results were analyzed using the BioNumerics Software (Applied-
Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium).

2.6. Nucleotide sequencing analysis

PCR products of integrons were puriﬁed with a kit (TaKaRa). The
DNA sequences of the PCR products were determined at Beijing
AuGCT biotechnology Co., Ltd, and aligned using BLAST program
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/).

3. Results

3.1. Isolation and identiﬁcation of Salmonella

Of the 764 retail meat samples, 333 (44%) were positive of
Salmonella, including 276 (54%) of the 515 chicken, 28 (31%) of the 91
pork, 13 (17%) of the 78 beef and 16 (20%) of the 80 lamb samples
(Table 1). A total of 359 Salmonella isolates were collected from the
333 Salmonella-positive samples (1–3 isolates per sample) including
292 isolates from chicken, 38 from pork, 13 from beef and 16 from
lamb.

Twenty-four serovars were identiﬁed among the 359 Salmonella
isolates. The top 10 serovars were Enteritidis (n=113), Typhimurium
(n=48), Shubra (n=36), Indiana (n=35), Derby (n=34), Djugu
(n=25), Infantis (n=11), Agona (n=9), Othmarschen (n=8) and
Virchow (n=8) (Table 2). The most commonly recovered serovars
from different retail meats were Enteritidis, Typhimurium, Shubra
and Indiana from chicken; Derby, Enteritidis and Typhimurium from
pork; Typhimurium, Derby and Agona from beef; and Derby, Djugu
and Saintpaul from lamb. Several unusual serovars including Pakistan,
Rideau and Bsilla were recovered from pork and beef, whereas

Rissen, Brancaster, Braenderup and Litchﬁeld were isolated from
chicken. In contrast, other serovars such as Enteritidis, Typhimurium
and Indiana were recovered from each of the four types of retail meats
(Table 2).

3.2. Antimicrobial susceptibility

Two hundred and eighty-four (79%) Salmonella isolates were
resistant to at least one antimicrobial, and 252 (70%) to three or more,
55 (15%) to 13 or more. Resistance was most frequently observed to
sulfamethoxazole (67%), followed by trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
(58%) and tetracycline (56%), and to a lesser extent kanamycin (37%),
nalidixic acid (35%), ampicillin (33%), amoxicillin–clavulanic acid
(32%) and ceftriaxone (16%) (Table 3). Resistance to beta-lactam
antimicrobials was most common among the chicken isolates, 11% of
which exhibited cefoxitin resistance compared to 5% and 0% of pork
and beef isolates, respectively (Table 3). Ceftriaxone resistance (19%)
was only observed among the chicken isolates, and ciproﬂoxacin
resistance (26%) was also primarily seen in chicken isolates. Similar
resistance to tetracycline was found among chicken (57%), pork
(53%), beef (46%) and lamb (56%) isolates.

When analyzed by types of retail meats, chicken isolates showed the
highest rate of resistance to at least one antimicrobial (80%), followed by
those recovered from pork (79%), lamb (69%) and beef (62%) (Table 4).
The percentages of resistance to 4–6 antimicrobials were similar (11–15%)

among Salmonella from the four meat products. However, approximately
28% of chicken, 24% of pork isolates were resistant to ≥9 antimicrobials
compared to 8% of beef and 7% of lamb isolates (Table 4).

When analyzed by serovar, Salmonella isolates most frequently
exhibiting resistance to 1–3 antimicrobials were Salmonella II (57%),
Derby (50%), Enteritidis (44%), Typhimurium (25%) and Agona (22%)
(Table 5). Isolates displaying resistance to 4–6 antimicrobials were
Rideau (100%), Virchow (63%), Saintpaul (50%), Agona (44%) and
Infantis (36%). Those isolates commonly showing resistance to ≥9
antimicrobials were observed among several serovars including
Shubra (89%), Indiana (88%) and Typhimurium (27%). Most Salmo-
nella serovars displayed resistance to examined antimicrobials except
Othmarschen and Djugu (Table 5).

3.3. Presence of class I integrons and beta-lactamase genes

Class I integrons were identiﬁed in 37 Salmonella isolates (10%).
Different integron proﬁles including 0.75 kb, 1 kb, 1.2 kb, 1.4 kb,
1.8 kb and 2 kb integrons were identiﬁed, with the most common
being a 1.4 kb integron (n=14), followed by a 1.2 kb integron (n=7).
One isolate yielded two different integrons. Ten Salmonella isolates,
representing different retail meats, serovars and integrons, were
selected for DNA sequence analysis (Table 6). Five resistance gene
cassettes were identiﬁed, including aadA, tetR, dhfr, blaPSE-1, blaDHA-1
and blaVEB-1, which encode resistance to streptomycin, tetracycline,

trimethoprim and beta-lactamase, respectively. One Enteritidis isolate
from chicken contained two integrons (1.2/1.8) carrying three
resistance genes (blaPSE-1/dhfr17-aadA5). Four 1.4 kb integrons carry
four different resistance genes (Table 5).

Ceftriaxone and/or cefoperazone resistance were observed among
62 isolates (17.2%) representing 8 different serovars (Kallo, Derby,
Enteritidis, Tennessee, Djugu, Shubra, Typhimurium and Indiana)
recovered primarily from chicken. blaTEM was identiﬁed in 32 ceftriaxone
and/or cefoperazone resistant isolates (51.6%), and blaCMY-2 in 35 resistant
isolates (56.5%).

3.4. PFGE

A total of 210 Salmonella isolates including serovars Enteritidis,
Typhimurium, Shubra and Indiana were analyzed for genetic related-
ness using PFGE with XbaI.

Fifty-two different PFGE patterns were observed among the 109
isolates of Enteritidis (Fig. 1). Using a cutoff value of 96% similarity, six
clusters and several
individual types were observed. The most
common clusters consisted of 57 and 38 isolates, respectively (data
not shown). In the ﬁrst cluster, although these isolates were mainly
recovered from chicken (n=51), the samples were collected from
different districts (44 from Yangling, 11 from Xian and 2 from Baoji) in
different times over a year (data not shown). PFGE analysis also
exhibited good correlations with antimicrobial resistance phenotypes
(data not shown).

The Typhimurium isolates (n=35) were assigned to 19 different
PFGE patterns (Fig. 2). Eleven (31.4%) isolates shared one PFGE
pattern. Using a cutoff value of 95% similarity, six clusters and a few
individual types were observed. The most common clusters consisted
of 8 and 15 isolates, respectively. Twenty-eight (80%) isolates in this

The Shubra isolates (n=35) were assigned to 23 different PFGE
patterns (Fig. 3). Using a cutoff value of 95% similarity, six clusters and
some individual types were observed. The most common cluster
consisted of 13 isolates. Thirty-three isolates (94%) in this serovar
recovered from chicken except 1 from pork and 1 from lamb.

Indiana isolates (n=31) were assigned to 22 different patterns
(Fig. 4). Unlike the other serovars, no predominant PFGE type was
found.

4. Discussion

In this study, we screened retail meat products collected from four
districts of Shaanxi Province in China for the presence of Salmonella,
and further characterized Salmonella isolates using serotyping,
antimicrobial susceptibility and PFGE.

The present study 44% of the retail meats and 54% of the chicken
samples were contaminated with Salmonella, compared to 38%
reported in Henan Province, a neighbor province of Shaanxi (Zhang
et al, 2009), 60% in Spain (Carraminana et al., 1997), 61–69% in Canada
(Lammerding et al., 1988), 69% in Greece (Arvanitidou et al., 1998),
and 6–35% in the United States (White et al., 2001). However, several
factors must be taken into account when making such comparisons,
including differences in country and origin, type of meat samples,
sampling seasons, slaughterhouse sanitation, and isolation methods.
Enteritidis was the most common serovar identiﬁed, particularly in
chicken meats. This serovar was also found to be a predominant serovar
in poultry products in other survey studies (Arvanitidou et al., 1998;
Machado and Bernardo, 1990; Plummer et al., 1995; Uyttendaele et al.,
1998), as well as one of the most common serovars that cause human
salmonellosis in many countries. Although, to our knowledge, no
reports on the occurrence of Salmonella serovars isolated from humans
in Shaanxi Province, Xia (2009) reported that in Henan Province, the
second most common Salmonella serovar isolated from humans was
Enteritidis (17%). Data from Asia, Europe and Latin America have
indicated that Enteritidis is the most common serovar among human
isolates (Galanis et al., 2006) Other serovars that were repeatedly
recovered in the present study included Typhimurium, Shubra, Indiana
and Derby. The ﬁndings were in agreement with those described in
previous studies showing that Typhimurium, Enteritidis and Derby are
the most common serovars worldwide, poultry meats and eggs are the
major reservoir of Enteritidis, whereas Typhimurium is widespread
(Bangtrakulnonth et al., 2004; Cui et al., 2005; Guard-Petter, 2001;
Herikstad et al., 2002; Olsen et al., 2001; Xia et al., 2009). Other serovars
such as Newport, Heidelberg, Weltevreden and Kentucky, that are

common in many countries, were rarely detected in Shaanxi Province
(Chen et al., 2004; Galanis et al., 2006; Herikstad et al., 2002).

Antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella has become a signiﬁcant
public health concern worldwide. Surveillance data demonstrated a
noticeable increase in overall antimicrobial resistance among salmo-

nellae from 20%–30% in the early 1990s to as high as 70% in some
countries in 2000s (Su et al., 2004). Our results indicated that only 75
of 359 (21%) of the Salmonella isolates were susceptible to the
antimicrobial agents tested, whereas nearly 80% of the isolates were
resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent, 26% to more than 9

antimicrobials. A high percentage of antimicrobial resistant Salmo-
nella from retail meats was also reported by several investigators
(Arvanitidou et al., 1998; Bokanyi et al., 1990; Chen et al., 2004;
D'Aoust et al., 1992). As animals are a main reservoir of Salmonella and
the use of antimicrobial in food animals for therapy, prophylaxis and
growth promotion accelerates the emergence of antimicrobial
resistant pathogens, it is not surprising that an increased number of
human salmonellosis cases are caused by foodborne antimicrobial
resistant Salmonella (Barbosa and Levy, 2000). Of the serovars
identiﬁed in the present study, Shubra, Indiana, Virchow and Derby
showed the highest rate of antimicrobial resistance and multidrug
resistance, whereas Enteritidis was relatively more susceptible to
antimicrobial agents, which was in agreement with previous
observations among Salmonella recovered from retail meats and
food animals (Su et al. 2004; Zhao et al., 2007), but differed to some

reports (Antunes et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2004). Among human
clinical isolates recovered in China, a recent study reported that 31
ciproﬂoxacin-resistant clinical Salmonella isolates were also resistant
to ≥8 other antimicrobial drugs (Cui et al., 2008). In Henan Province,
54% of human isolates were MDR strains (Xia et al., 2009).

In the present study, resistance to nalidixic acid and ciproﬂoxacin
was very common (35% and 21%, respectively), particularly among
isolates recovered from chicken and pork meats. Other reports from
China and several countries also indicated an increase in ciproﬂoxacin-
resistant Salmonella (Cailhol et al., 2006; Cui et al., 2008; Lauderdale
et al., 2006). As infections with ciproﬂoxacin-resistant Salmonellae are
associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and ciproﬂoxacin-
resistant Salmonella are usually resistant to multiple drugs (Cui et al.,
2008), it presents an enormous challenge to the treatment of Salmonella
infections in humans and animals.

Ceftriaxone is another commonly used drug to treat children with
Salmonella infections, particularly in invasive infections, due to its
favorable pharmacokinetic properties and low prevalence of resistance
(White et al., 2001). The increased prevalence of ceftriaxone-resistant
Salmonella strains in food animals may be related to the veterinary use of
ceftiofur, an expanded-spectrum cephalosporin used only in veterinary
medicine (Carattoli et al., 2002). Resistance to ceftriaxone is largely due
to the AmpC β-lactamase (blaCMY-2 and blaTEM) genes (Chen et al., 2004;
White et al., 2001). In this study, more than 50% ceftriaxone and/or
cefoperazone-resistant isolates harbored blaTEM or blaCMY-2. The
dissemination of Salmonella resistant to multiple drugs,
including
cephalosporins, through food has important public health implications.
Integrons, a mobile DNA element, are well known for their ability to
transfer resistance and often contain one or more linked antimicrobial-
resistance genes (Hall, 1997; Hall and Stokes, 1993). Our data showed that
class I integrons were widely spread in different Salmonella serovars
recovered from different retail meats. Several serovars including Agona,
Virchow, Enteritidis, Indiana, Galiema and Shubra contained integrons in
size from 0.75 kb to 1.8 kb, which harbored aadA2, blaPSE-1, dhfrXII-aadA2
and tetR, conﬁrming that integrons play an important part in the transfer
of resistance among bacteria (Cloeckaert et al., 2000; Guerra et al., 2000;
White et al., 2001; Zhao et al., 2007).

The PFGE results indicated a genetically diverse Salmonella
population, whereas several indistinguishable PFGE patterns were
shared among isolates within certain serovars obtained from different
retail meats. For example, two clusters of 23 and 14 of Enteritidis
isolates that recovered from different retail meats, different time and
different districts showed the same PFGE patterns. The majority of
these isolates exhibited similar resistance proﬁle. Similar results were
also seen in Typhimurium and Indiana.

In conclusion, our ﬁndings demonstrated that Salmonella contam-
ination was common in retail meats, and that the Salmonella isolates
were diverse both phenotypically and genetically. Additionally, many
Salmonella isolates were resistant to multiple antimicrobials, and
multidrug resistance was strongly associated with types of serovars.
Surveillance programs concerning the prevalence of
foodborne
pathogens and their antimicrobial resistance and subtyping proﬁles
are important for conducting epidemiological investigations and for
monitoring the development and dissemination of antimicrobial
resistance. Such information is needed for making science based
public health policy, and developing effective intervention strategies
including implementation of hazard analysis of critical control point
programs in food production to ensure the safety of our food supplies.
