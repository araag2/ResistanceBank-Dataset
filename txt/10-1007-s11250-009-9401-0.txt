Abstract Prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of
thermophilic Campylobacter isolated from free-
ranging ducks was determined in Morogoro Munici-
pality, Tanzania. Ninety intestinal contents from
ducks were screened for thermophilic Campylobacter
using Skirrow’s protocol. Of
the Campylobacter
jejuni isolates, 50 were tested for sensitivity to 12
antibiotics. Overall prevalence of thermophilic Cam-
pylobacter was 80%. The prevalence of Campylobac-
ter in adult ducks (91.3%) was significantly (p<0.05)
higher than ducklings (68.2%). The isolation rate of
C. jejuni (81.9%) was significantly (P<0.001) higher
than C. coli (18.1%). All C.
isolates were
susceptible to streptomycin, nitrofurantoin and ami-
kacin. Forty eight percent, 74% and 82% of isolates
were resistant to cefuroxime sodium, tetracycline and
ampicillin respectively. Between 20–50% of isolates
were resistant to erythromycin, gentamicin, cloxacil-
lin and amoxicillin. Norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin
jejuni resistance of 10% and 16%
had lower C.
respectively. C.
isolates from adult ducks
showed significantly higher rates of resistance (p<
0.05) to most antibiotics than did duckling isolates.

High prevalence of thermophilic Campylobacter in
ducks could be of public health significance in
Morogoro municipality. The observed multidrug
resistance in this study poses a threat of transfer of
antibiotic resistance to human pathogens because of
the close contact between ducks and human.

Introduction

Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata) represent about
5% of the estimated 30 million poultry in the country
(MOA 1994), and they are potential source of meat
and income to people with the minimum income in
Tanzania. Ducks are farmed on small scale backyard
flocks; however, the industry is economically impor-
tant
to families with limited resources. The small
population of ducks, their acceptability across differ-
ent cultures and religions and less susceptibility to
diseases promises for expansion of duck industry in
Tanzania. Generally ducks are managed under free
range in most rural and urban areas with no or
minimal care, and rarely get veterinary attention.
Because of less care, ducks may serve as a potential
reservoir of pathogenic infectious organisms like
Campylobacter to humans and other animals (Jordan
and Pattison 1996; Sonaiya and Swan 2004).

Thermophilic Campylobacter in particular Cam-
pylobacter jejuni
is recognized as among leading
causes of bacterial gastroenteritis in human world-
wide (Logan et al. 1999; Aarestrup and Engberg
2001). According to WHO (2001) the incidence of
Campylobacter infections worldwide has recently
surpassed those of salmonellosis and shigellosis.
Domestic birds such as ducks are carriers of Cam-
pylobacter spp. (Yogasundram et al. 1989) and serve
as major sources of infection to human (Waldenström
et al. 2002). Campylobacter-associated gastroenteritis
is normally self-limiting, and antimicrobial treatment
is reserved for patients with severe and advanced
infections (Aarestrup and Engberg 2001; Kurincic et
al. 2005). Infections respond to macrolide antibiotics
such as erythromycin, fluoroquinolone antibiotics like
ciprofloxacin, and also to tetracyclines, cephalospor-
ins, penicillins and sulphonamides (Alfredson et al.
2003, Lin et al. 2007).

There is generally little published information on
Campylobacter infections ducks in Tanzania, however,
studies elsewhere show high prevalence in ducks
managed in different management systems (Prescott
and Bruin-Mosch 1981; Kasrazadeh and Genigeorgis
1987; Ridsdale et al. 1998). Investigation on antibiotic
resistance of Campylobacter isolates shows an increased
resistance of animal
isolates to different antibiotics.
Studies by Endtz et al. (1991) and Engberg et al. (2001)
showed increased proportion of Campylobacter isolates
resistant
to antibiotics especially fluoroquinolones. It
was postulated that introduction of fluoroquinolones in
veterinary practice in the 1990s has led into increase in
Campylobacter isolates that are resistant to fluoroqui-
nolones. Several countries have since then reported
increased resistance of Campylobacter isolates from
humans and animals (Steinbrückner et al. 2001, Feierl et
al. 2001). These findings indicate the potential danger of
antibiotic resistant Campylobacter spp. which could
subsequently be transferred to humans through food
chain.

Despite the increased interest

in Campylobacter
studies in the world, there is a dearth of information
on prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of isolates
from animals and humans in Tanzania. Therefore the
purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence
of thermophilic Campylobacter in clinically normal
ducks and to establish antibiotic resistance of C.
jejuni isolates from backyard duck flocks in Moro-
goro municipality, Tanzania.

Materials and methods

Study areas

The study was conducted in Morogoro municipality.
The municipality is situated at the latitude 5.7 to 10oS
and longitude 35.6 to 39.5oE, with an elevation of 500
to 600 m above sea level and is about 200 km west of
Dar es Salaam. Although selection of Morogoro
municipality, as study area, was based on convenience
of accessibility from the laboratory (due to limited
funding of the project), it generally represents back-
yard smallholder duck farming in urban areas of
Tanzania. The study duck flocks were from different
suburbs of Morogoro municipality namely Cham-
wino, Kihonda, Kilakala, K’ndege, Konga, Mafiga,
Mtoni, Mwanza, Nanenane and Vibandani.

Study population and management of ducks

The population under study comprised of backyard
duck (Cairina moschata) flocks in Morogoro Munic-
ipality. Ducks (Cairina moschata) in study areas were
housed in backyard and allowed to scavenge freely
during day around homestead. Some households had
local chickens which scavenged for food together
with the ducks. The ducks flock size ranged from 15
to 100 birds. All farmers provided water, table and
kitchen remains to their ducks. Occasionally,
the
ducks were provided with cereals as supplementary
feed. No disease preventive measure was recorded to
be done in the investigated flocks. Ducks were used
in this study because they rank the second in poultry
population in Tanzania and the industry constitutes up
to 1.5 million birds (MOA 1994).

Sampling and sample size

This was a cross sectional study which was conducted
between January and July 2005. The samples were
collected from the purposively selected households
with backyard duck flocks and willingness of farmers
to participate in the study. Different duck flocks had
different age groups of ducks and sex category. A
total of 15 backyard duck flocks were involved in the
study. For sampling purposes the ducks were catego-
rized into ducklings; between two and five months
and adult ducks (six months and above). The sample
size of 90 ducks was selected to allow a detection

167

level of 5% with 99% certainty (Canon and Roe
1986). These included 49 females and 41 male ducks
of which 46 were adults and 44 ducklings.

Sample collection, isolation and identification
of thermophilic Campylobacter

The selected ducks were purchased from the owners and
transported in cages to Faculty of Veterinary Medicine
Public Health laboratory. Each flock was visited once
and all the six selected ducks were assessed at the same
time. Upon arrival the ducks were examined clinically
before were killed by cervical dislocation and subjected
to post-mortem examination. The abdominal cavity was
opened and the whole gastrointestinal tract (GIT) was
removed and straightened to expose the caecum. Using
a sterile pair of scissors, a small cut was made through
the caecal wall
to expose caecal contents. Caecal
contents of each duck were separately swabbed by
sterile cotton swabs and subsequently placed in sterile
universal bottles containing 10 ml of Preston broth
(Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, UK) with Preston supple-
ments (Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, UK) for enrichment.
Inoculated universal bottles were subsequently loaded
in microaerobic candle jars (Coldstream Engineering
Ltd, Arista, Sweden) with a lighting candle and
incubated at 37°C for 24 hours as described by Skirrow
and Benjamin (1980). After 24 hours of incubation, the
universal bottles with enriched samples were shaken
and a loopful broth culture was subcultured onto
modified charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar
(mCCDA) (Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, UK) for primary
isolation of thermophilic Campylobacter. The inocu-
lated petri dishes were incubated at 43°C for 48 hours
under microaerobic condition and Campylobacter
suspect colonies were subcultured on blood agar
(Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, UK) at 37°C under micro-
aerobic environment for 24 hours. Suspected thermo-
philic Campylobacter colonies on blood agar that were
Gram-negative, curved or spiral rods and showed
corkscrew like motion, positive to catalase, oxidase
and nitrate reduction tests were further tested for
hippurate hydrolysis, H2S production and susceptibility
to nalidixic acid and cephalothin. These parameters
formed the basis for the identification of C. jejuni, C.
coli or C. lari, as proposed by On (1996).

For the hippurate hydrolysis test, those organisms
yielding a positive test were considered C. jejuni, while
those organisms that showed a negative reaction were

considered C. coli and C. lari. For hydrogen sulfide
(H2S) production test, all the tested Campylobacter
strains were found to be negative for
the test.
Susceptibility tests to nalidixic acid (30 μg) (Oxoid
Ltd, Basingstoke, UK) and cephalothin (30 μg) (Oxoid
Ltd, Basingstoke, UK) were performed for all isolates
of thermophilic Campylobacter spp.
in accordance
with the criteria set by the National Committee for
Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLs) using the disc
diffusion method (NCCLs 2002). The isolates were
classified as sensitive and/or resistant according to the
standardized tables supplied by the NCCLs (2002).
Campylobacter strains that were sensitive to nalidixic
acid but resistant to cephalothin were considered C.
jejuni and C. coli, while strains that were resistant to
both drugs were considered C. lari.

Antimicrobial agents and susceptibility testing

Antibiotic susceptibility test was performed on Muller
Hinton (MH) Agar (Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, UK) by
disc diffusion method as described by Luangtongkum
et al. (2007). The antibiotic susceptibility test was
performed only to C.
jejuni since it had highest
prevalence. A total of 50 C. jejuni isolates were tested
of which 20 were from ducklings and 30 from adult
ducks. Briefly, Campylobacter suspensions were
prepared in a sterile normal saline and the suspensions
were adjusted to a turbidity equivalent
to a 0.5
McFarland standard. Sterile cotton-tipped swabs were
used to transfer the inoculum onto Mueller-Hinton
plates to produce a confluent
lawn of bacterial
growth. After the inoculum on the plates was dried,
antibiotic discs were distributed over the inoculated
plates using a BBL Sensi-disc dispenser (BBL Becton
Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville,
MD). These plates were then incubated at 42°C for
48 hours under microaerobic conditions. The follow-
ing antimicrobials were tested: streptomycin (10µg),
amoxicillin (10µg), ampicillin (10µg), ciprofloxacin
(5µg), cefuroxime sodium (30µg), gentamicin (10µg),
cloxacillin (5µg), tetracycline (30µg), nitrofurantoin
(30µg), amikacin (30µg), erythromycin (15µg) and
norfloxacin (10µg) (Span Diagnostic, Surat India).
After 48 hours of incubation, the diameters of inhi-
bition zones were measured with slipping calipers. For
test and interpretation of the results we followed the
general guidelines of NCCLS (2002) and Gaudreau
and Gibert (1997).

Ethical considerations

The permission to carry out this study was granted by
the Morogoro municipal livestock officer and ethical
approval for the study was given by the Ethical
Committees of Sokoine University of Agriculture
(Morogoro, Tanzania). Verbal consent was obtained
from each of the heads of households after explaining
the purpose and importance of the study prior to
purchase of ducks.

Results

Prevalence and species distribution
of Campylobacter isolates

Thermophilic Campylobacter isolation frequencies in
different suburbs are summarized in Table 1. The
overall prevalence of thermophilic Campylobacter in
ducks was 80% (95% confidence interval (CI)=70.2–
87.7; n=72). Higher infection rate (p<0.05) was
recorded in adult ducks (91.3%; n=42) than ducklings
(68.2%; n=30). The isolation rate of C. jejuni was
significantly (P<0.001) higher (81.9%; n=59) than
that of C. coli (18.1%; n=13).

Antimicrobial resistance results

Table 2 shows C. jejuni prevalence of antimicrobial
resistance to 12 antibiotics. All C. jejuni isolates from
ducks were susceptible to streptomycin, nitrofurantoin
and amikacin. Forty eight percent, 74% and 82% of
the isolates were resistant
to cefuroxime sodium,
tetracycline and ampicillin respectively. Between 20–
50% of C. jejuni isolates were resistant to several
antibiotics which included erythromycin, gentamicin,
cloxacillin and amoxicillin. It was observed that C.
jejuni isolates from adult ducks showed significantly
higher rates of resistance (p<0.05) to most antibiotics
than did duckling isolates.

Discussion

This study has demonstrated the significance of ducks as
reservoirs in the dissemination of thermophilic Campylo-
bacter in particular C. jejuni in Morogoro municipality.
To the best of our Knowledge this is the first report of
the occurrence of thermophillic Campylobacter in ducks
in Tanzania. Although higher prevalence of Campylo-
bacter recorded in this study concurred with findings by
Luechtefeld et al. (1980); Prescott and Bruin-Mosch
(1981); Kasrazadeh and Genigeorgis (1987);
it far
exceeds that in local scavenging ducks in Ghana where
Abrahams et al. (1990) reported a prevalence of 43.5%.

Trop Anim Health Prod (2010) 42:165–172

Contrary to the present findings; Tsai and Hsiang (2005)
established a prevalence of 43.5% in intensively kept
ducks. Variations in isolation rates may be due to
several reasons, such as differences in local prevalence
of Campylobacter in the specific region and manage-
ment of ducks where the study was conducted.

(81.9%)
Campylobacter appears to be comparable to findings
of Kasrazadeh and Genigeorgis (1987); Bryan and
Doyle (1995) and Whyte et al. (2004). However,
other investigators reported higher prevalance of C.
coli than other thermophilic Campylobacter in ducks
(Ridsdale et al. 1998) (Pezzotti et al. 2002; Machado
et al. 1994). Studies by Madden et al. (1998) and
Aquino et al. (2002) showed no difference between
prevalence of C. coli and C. jejuni in ducks. The
difference in species isolations may depend on
common Campylobacter spp. circulating in the local
environment, sampling techniques employed, season-
ality and laboratory methodologies employed. In the
present study, C. jejuni was isolated from adult ducks
and ducklings of either sex sampled from different
locations within Morogoro municipality. Previous
similar studies in Morogoro also found a higher
prevalence of C.
in chickens, humans and
craws than C. coli (Jiwa et al. 1994; Mdegela et al.
2006). This shows that C.
is the common
species that may be circulating from either ducks to
chickens, humans and other animals and vice versa.
Relationship of age and carrier rate of Campylobacter
has been explained before in other species of domestic
animals. The present findings which are inline with
those of Kazwala et al. (1992) and Mccrea et al. (2006)
who pointed out that the carrier rate of thermophillic
Campylobacter in adult chickens is higher than that of
ducklings. Studies in chickens by Kazwala et al. (1992)
found that Campylobacter infection rates in poultry
increase with age. Chicks may become colonized with
Campylobacter within seven days of life but
the
bacterial burden may reach up to 1.2×107CFU/g as
the age increases (Saleha et al. 1998). However, the
results of our study are contrary to those of Kasrazadeh
and Genigeorgis (1987) who found 100% prevalence in
eight days old ducklings. These findings underline that
association of age and carriage of Campylobacter
requires further study. It can be speculated that high
infection rates in adult ducks is due to longevity and
feeding behaviour on wet feeds which increase chances

jejuni

jejuni

of getting repeated infections (Adekeye et al. 1989;
Saleha et al. 1998). Indeed, ducks prefer wet feed of
which under free scavenging environments the exposure
rate to infection is high.

Comparison of antibiotic resistance patterns revealed
that all tested isolates were sensitive to streptomycin,
nitrofurantoin, and amikacin. The findings are inline with
studies by Aydin et al. (2001) and Sâenz et al. (2000).
Streptomycin, nitrofurantoin, and amikacin are not
among the commonly used drugs in veterinary practice
in Tanzania and this could be the reason for none of
duck C. jejuni strains appeared to be resistant. Differ-
ently, C. jejuni resistance to ampicillin was the highest
among all antibiotics tested which was earlier correlated
with ß-lactamase (Taylor and Courvalin 1988). Resis-
tance to ampicillin has previously been reported by
other researchers elsewhere (Quinn et al. 1998; Aydin et
al. 2001). It is possible that production of ß-lactamase
by Campylobacter isolates in this study is responsible
for high frequency of ampicillin resistant strains.

jejuni

Due to inherent susceptibility of C.

to
erythromycin, it has been used as first line drug in
treatment of Campylobacter human enteritis (Engberg
et al. 2001; Gibreel and Taylor 2006). However, the
present findings do not fully support this assertion.
The increased rate of resistance to erythromycin in
developing countries has also been demonstrated in
Nigeria where in two studies 10 years apart; sensitiv-
ity to erythromycin dropped from 82% of the tested
strains to 20.8% (Coker and Adefeso 1994).

Studies by Hoge et al. (1998), Prats et al. (2000) and
Senok et al. (2007) reported a high level of ciproflox-
acin resistance (>80%) contrary to the present study
where resistance was 16%. The present study is inline
with the findings of 6-10% resistance reported by Bae et
al. (2004) and Hassan et al. (2007). Hakanen et al.
(2003) reported a resistance rate of 68% in Finland
while Kurincic et al. (2005) reported a resistance of
58.2% in Slovenia. The low resistance rate observed in
this study may be due to the fact that fluoroquinolones
have not been extensively used in veterinary practice in
Tanzania. Reports from developed countries show a
marked resistance to quinolones which have been
associated with topoisomerases mutations in quinolone
resistance determining region of gyrA gene (Nachamkin
et al. 2001, Backmann et al. 2004).

Furthermore,

the study has recorded C.

jejuni
resistance rate of 74% to tetracyclines which is the
most extensively used drug in veterinary medicine in

170

Trop Anim Health Prod (2010) 42:165–172

Tanzania. High resistance of Campylobacter strains to
tetracyclines has previously been reported by various
researchers (Prats et al. 2000; Beilei et al. 2003; Bae et
al. 2004). This higher level of C. jejuni resistance to
tetracycline may be probably due to its overuse in
animals which might have caused the bacteria to acquire
a new resistance gene which is plasmid-mediated
(Roberts 1996). Hence,
there is possibility of gene
transfer among Campylobacter and other bacteria in the
animals. Relatively high resistance of the isolated strains
has also been shown to gentamycin despite its recom-
mended use. These data emphasize the need of
antibiotic resistance surveillance among the isolates of
veterinary and medical importance in Tanzania.
The findings further demonstrated that C.

jejuni
isolates from adult ducks showed significantly higher
rates of resistance to most antibiotics than did duckling
isolates. This may be due to the longer raising period of
adult ducks (six months and above). Therefore the birds
get exposed to different types of antibiotics for a longer
period and this may account for the higher rate of
resistant strains of Campylobacter.

Generally antimicrobial resistance described in this
paper could be due to multifactorial determinants. It is
accepted now that food animals are primary source of
antibiotic resistance genes present in human food-borne
pathogens, and imprudent use of antibiotics in humans
also significantly lead to development and selection of
resistant strains (Bae et al. 2004; Nachamkin et al. 2001).
Thus the observed multidrug resistance in this study
poses a threat to humans by limiting therapeutic choice
of antibiotics. In conclusion, findings from this study
have established a high prevalence of thermophilic
Campylobacter in particular C. jejuni in ducks. High
rate of antimicrobial resistance recorded may result from
indiscriminate use of antibiotics in animals and may
pose serious danger to the public health.
