Objective:  To determine the occurrence of  CTX-M producing  Escherichia  coli (E.  coli)  from cattle  feces in Bogor 
slaughterhouse, Indonesia.   
Methods: A total of 220 cattle feces samples were collected from Bogor slaughterhouse from March to April 2015. 
Presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing E. coli was detected by disc diffusion test based on 
the recommendation from Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (2014). Bacterial strains which were confirmed 
as producing ESBLs were further analyzed for the presence of bla genes of the ESBL by PCR.   
Results:  The results showed that  CTX-M producing  E.  coli isolates were detected in 19 samples  from 220 samples 
(8.6%). The β-lactamase genes detected were CTX-M-1 (n = 10) and CTX-M-9 (n = 9). All of the CTX-M producing E. 
coli isolates showed multidrug resistance phenotypes to at least four antibiotics. The highest incidence of antibiotics 
resistance  was  showed  to  ampicillin  (100.0%),  cefotaxime  (100.0%),  and  cefpodoxime  (100.0%),  followed  by 
streptomycin  (84.3%),  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  (73.7%),  erythromycin  (52.6%),  kanamycin  (26.3%), 
doxycycline (10.5%), and ceftazidime (0.0%).  
Conclusions: Detection of CTX-M-producing E. coli in cattle feces raises important questions as they can represent a 
potential risk factor to public health. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT1. Introduction 

 

   Escherichia coli (E. coli) belongs to the family of Enterobacteriaceae and is common in the gastrointestinal as 

normal microflora in human and animals[1,2]. These bacteria have capability to get and disseminate the resistant 

genes  for  antibiotics[3-5].  One  of  the  currently  most  important  resistance  mechanisms  is  based  on  the  plasmid-

mediated production of extended spectrum  β-lactamases (ESBL) that inactivate these compounds by hydrolyzing 

their  β-lactam  ring[6,7].  Until  now,  more  than  600  ESBL  variants  are  known.  Among  them,  over  100  CTX-M 

enzymes  so  far  reported  may  be  grouped  into  five  main  subgroups[8].  The  CTX-M  types  of  β-lactamases  are 

dominant family of ESBLs in E. coli, with particular subtypes associated with different geographic regions[2]. As a 

matter  of  growing  concern,  resistance  caused  by  ESBLs  is  often  associated  with  resistance  to  other  classes  of 

antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole[8]. 

   The dissemination of CTX-M E. coli in food production units may occur via fecal cross-contamination between 

groups  of  animals  (or  individuals),  and  the  contamination  of  food  derived  from  animals  may  occur  during 

processing in the slaughterhouse[9]. Consequently, without good hygienic practices, foods may act as a vehicle of 

transferring of β-lactam-resistant bacteria to the gastrointestinal tract of the consumers[10]. This study was aimed to 

determine the occurrence of CTX-M producing E. coli from cattle feces in Bogor slaughterhouse, Indonesia. 

 

2. Material and methods 

 

2.1. Isolation and identification of ESBL producing E. coli 

 

   A total of 220 fecal samples from Bogor slaughterhouse, Indonesia were collected from March to April 2015. 

Each  fecal  sample  was  collected  directly  from  rectum.  Fecal  samples  were  put  in  sterile  plastic  bags  and 

transported to the laboratory using cooling box. Fecal samples were rinsed in 0.1% buffered peptone water (Oxoid 

CM1049, England). Rectum contents (25 g) were diluted in 225 mL of 0.1% buffered peptone water. Rinsates (10 

mL) were enriched for 24 h at 37 °C supplemented with 20 µL cefotaxime (1 µg/mL). There after the enrichment 

was streaked onto MacConkay agar (Merck 1.05465.0500, Germany) containing 1 mg/L cefotaxime, and incubated 

at 37 °C for 24 h under aerobic condition. The colonies that ware presumed as E. coli will appear as red colonies in 

the media, and surrounded by turbid zone.  Further works were continued by KOH test, Gram staining, oxidase test 

(Oxoid MB0266A, England), and biochemical test [indole, methyl red, Voges-Proskauer, and citrate (IMViC)]. The 

colonies that were presumed as E. coli were selected and sub cultured onto tryptic soy broth (Merck 1.05458.0500, 

Germany)  at  37  °C  for  24  h.  The  identification  of  the  E.  coli-like  colonies  were  then  confirmed  using  API  20E 

(Biomerieux). Isolates were stored in tryptic soy broth containing 20% glycerol at -20 °C until further workup.

2.2. ESBL confirmation and antibiotic susceptibility testing  

 

   All  cefotaxime-resistant,  and  oxidase-negative,  isolates  were  confirmed  for  ESBL  production  by  the  disk 

diffusion  method  according  to  the  Clinical  Laboratory  Standards  Institute  (CLSI)  guidelines[11].  The  inhibition 

zones were determined for each isolate, using antibiotic disks, each containing 30 mg of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, 

or  cefpodoxime,  either  alone  or  in  combination  with  10  mg  of  clavulanic  acid  (MAST  Group  Ltd.,  Reinfeld, 

Germany). 

   E.  coli  isolates  which  produced  ESBL  were  subjected  to  susceptibility  testing  against  9  antimicrobial  agents 

(ampicillin,  cefotaxime,  cefpodoxime,  ceftazidime,  streptomycin,  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,  erythromycin, 

kanamycin,  and  doxycycline)  with  disk  diffusion  method  according  to  CLSI  protocols  and  evaluated  with  CLSI 

criteria[11]. E. coli ATCC 25922 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (K. pneumoniae) were used as a control 

strain. 

 

2.3. Characterization of β-lactamase by PCR 

 

   Bacterial strains which were confirmed as producing ESBLs were further analyzed for the presence of bla genes 

of  the  ESBL  subtypes  TEM,  SHV,  and  CTX-M  (group 1, 2,  8,  9, or  25)  by  PCR using primers  and  conditions  as 

previously  reported[12].  Bacterial  DNA  was  isolated  with  the  DNeasy  blood  and  tissue  kit  (Qiagen,  Hilden, 

Germany) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.  Two strains, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 was used 

as standard ESBL-positive strains and a non-ESBL-producing organism (E. coli ATCC 25922) was used as negative 

control.  PCR  products  were  determined  by  electrophoresis  in  a  2%  agarose  gel  (Biozym,  Hessisch-Oldendorf, 

Germany). The molecular marker GeneRuler 100-bp DNA ladder (MBI  Fermentas, St.  Leon-Roth, Germany) was 

used. 

 

2.4. Sequencing of bla genes 

 

   The  ESBL-encoding  genes  blaTEM,  blaSHV,  and  blaCTX-M  of  the  ESBL-positive  isolates  were  amplified  with 

primers  and  PCR  conditions  as  described  previously[12].  Resulting  amplicons  were  purified  using  the  PCR 

purification  kit  (Qiagen).  Sequencing  was  performed  at  SeqLab  (Goettingen,  Germany).  Results were  evaluated 

using the BLAST algorithm available at http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi. 

 

2.5. Data analysis 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

   Data were descriptively analyzed to describe occurrence of CTX-M producing E. coli isolated from cattle feces in 

Bogor slaughterhouse. 

 

3. Results 

 

   In  this present  study,  CTX-M  producing  E.  coli  was  detected  in  19  samples  from  220  samples  (8.6%).  The  β-

lactamase genes detected were CTX-M-1 (n = 10) and CTX-M-9 (n = 9). All of CTX-M producing E. coli isolates 

showed multidrug resistance phenotypes to at least four antibiotics.The highest incidence of antibiotics resistance 

was to ampicillin (100.0%), cefotaxime (100.0%), and cefpodoxime (100.0%), followed by streptomycin (84.3%), 

trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  (73.7%),  erythromycin  (52.6%),  kanamycin  (26.3%),  doxycycline  (10.5%),  and 

ceftazidime (0.0%).  Detail results on antibiotic susceptibilities of multidrug resistant ESBL producing E. coli was 

described in Table 1. 

 

4. Discussion 

 

   The results showed that the occrurance of 8.6% of CTX-M-producers in cattle feces was identified and blaCTX-M 

genes were detected. In this study the CTX-M-1 (52.6%) and CTX-M-9 (47.4%) groups were reported as the most 

prevalent in ESBL-producing E. coli isolates recovered from cattle feces samples. This is the first report of CTX-M 

producing E. coli in cattle feces, in Indonesia. 

   A similar study in Portugal showed that CTX-resistant E. coli isolates were detected in 5 of the 54 (9.3%) cattle 

feces samples and  CTX-M-1 enzyme  was the  most dominant  ESBL type  found in E.  coli cattle feces isolates[13]. 

Another study conducted in Germany sought that the presence of ESBL producing E. coli were detected in 17 of 

the  90  (18.9%)  in  cattle  feces  samples  and  showed  a  high  prevalence  of  CTX-M-1,  CTX-M-2  and  CTX-M-9 

ESBLs[14]. 

   CTX-M β-lactamases are now the most prevalent type of ESBL in most areas of the world, where the significant 

increase in the incidence of  ESBL in Enterobacteriaceae has been attributed to the dissemination of  members of 

CTX-M-1  and  CTX-M-9  families  of  CTX-M  enzymes[15].  The  over  100  CTX-M  enzymes  so  far  reported  may  be 

grouped into five main subgroups[8]. The rapid proliferation and worldwide spread of CTX-M-type ESBL in E. coli 

is a matter of concern both in human and veterinary medicine[15]. Furthermore, it has been reported that plasmids 

carrying  CTX-M  enzymes  can  transfer  these  determinants  to  other  commensal  Enterobacteriaceae,  such  as  K. 

pneumoniae, or to pathogens like Shigella or Salmonella spp.[7]. 

   As  a  matter  of  growing  concern,  resistance  caused  by  CTX-M  producer  is  often  associated  with  resistance  to 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTother classes of antibiotics like fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole[6,8]. This 

study  showed  that  all  of  CTX-M  producing  E.  coli  exhibited  multidrug  resistance  phenotypes  to  at  least  four 

antibiotics. It is important to emphasise that, often, some ESBL genes are located within mobile genetic elements, 

associated  with  other  resistance  genes,  conferring  resistance  to  antimicrobials  that  could  be  extensively  used 

among  animals  and  humans  (e.g.,  trimethoprim,  sulfamethoxazole  and  streptomycin)  and  which  could  play  an 

important role in the co-selection of these ESBL genes[4]. 

   CTX-M producing E. coli that was found in Bogor slaughterhouse could release resistance genes to environment. 

Bacterial contamination of the surface water, particularly contamination with feces-borne bacteria, has long been a 

water  quality  issue  owing  to  the  potential  for  disease  transmission[16].  Slaughterhouse  biosecurity  must  be 

increased to prevent dissemination of ESBL producing E. coli to environment. Moreover, vectors such as mice and 

flies may also play a part in the spread of antimicrobial resistance in farms[17]. 

   It  is  estimated  that  ESBL  producers  will  increase  in  future,  in  both  animals  and  humans[4].  Guidelines  for 

alternative therapies, monitoring programs, and development of preventive  medicine will decrease the spread of 

ESBLs in veterinary medicine. Together, these strategies could certainly reduce the impact of several multidrugs 

resistance microorganisms on animal health[18].   

   In conclusion, CTX-M β-lactamases (8.6%) are the most prevalent type of our ESBL-positive isolates and all of 

CTX-M producing E. coli isolates showed multidrug resistance phenotypes to at least four antibiotics. It could be 

threat  for  public  health  because  CTX-M  genes  can  be  easily  disseminate  into  the  environment,  food,  human, 

animals, and other pathogen bacteria.
