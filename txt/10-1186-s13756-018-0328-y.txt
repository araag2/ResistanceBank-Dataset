Abstract

Background: Administration of antimicrobials to food-producing animals is regarded as a major contributor to the
overall emergence of resistance in bacteria worldwide. However, few data are available on global antimicrobial use
and resistance (AMR) in livestock, especially from low- and middle-income countries.
Methods: We conducted a structured survey of 91 small-scale pig farms in the urban and peri-urban areas of
Phnom Penh, Cambodia, to assess the farmers’ knowledge, attitudes and practices related to antimicrobial use in
their pig production. Commensal Escherichia coli was isolated from three healthy pigs from each farm (n = 261) and
susceptibility testing was performed against 14 antimicrobials, using broth microdilution. Univariable logistic
regression and generalized linear mixed models were used to investigate potential associations between farm
characteristics, management factors and resistance to different types of antimicrobials.
Results: We found a widespread and arbitrary use of antimicrobials, often based on the farmer’s own judgment.
Around 66% of the farmers reported frequently self-adjusting treatment duration and dosage, and 45% had not
heard about the term ‘antimicrobial resistance’. The antimicrobials most commonly mentioned or kept by the
farmers were amoxicillin, tylosin, gentamicin and colistin. Around 37% used a feed concentrate that contained
antimicrobials, while antimicrobials for humans were used as a last-line treatment by 10% of the farmers.
Commensal E. coli exhibited high prevalence of resistance to several antimicrobials considered to be of critical
importance for human medicine, including ampicillin, ciprofloxacin and colistin, and multidrug-resistance was found
in 79% of the samples. Higher prevalence of resistance was observed on farms that administered prophylactic
antimicrobials and on farms that treated the entire group or herd in the event of disease.
Conclusion: The widespread and arbitrary use of antimicrobials in pig farming in Cambodia is highly worrisome.
Overall, farmers had a low awareness of the risks and consequences related to antimicrobial use and AMR. The
results presented in this study confirm the hypothesis that non-rational use of antimicrobials results in higher
prevalence of AMR and highlight the need for professional animal health systems that involve medically rational
use of antimicrobials in emerging economies such as Cambodia.

Background
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global health
concern and our decreased ability within human and
veterinary medicine to cure resistant infections will have
serious repercussions for future treatment and preven-
tion of infections in humans and for the productivity of
livestock [1–3]. The emergence of AMR is believed to be
partly caused by the inappropriate use within the live-
stock sector, where antimicrobials are widely adminis-
tered to animals for prevention and control of diseases
and, more controversially, for growth promotion pur-
poses [4–6]. Although data from several high-income
countries indicate extensive antimicrobial use and AMR
in livestock in these countries [7, 8], data from most
low- and middle-income countries are scarce. Historic-
ally, the primary problem in some low- and middle-
income countries has been the lack of antimicrobial
drugs [9, 10]. Recently, however, the access to antimicro-
bials has generally increased in urban areas in these
countries, with a consequent rise in the inappropriate
usage of such drugs in cities and towns [11]. Overall, the
use of antimicrobials in animal production is expected to
continue to increase globally due to growing demand
for animal-source foods, particularly in emerging econ-
omies [12]. Facilitated by the ongoing globalization of
trade and travel, AMR is rapidly spread throughout the
world [13].

Southeast Asia, a region with a high burden of infec-
tious diseases [14] and a dense population of both
humans and animals, is considered to be a hotspot for
the development of AMR [15]. This partly stems from
the expanding pig and poultry sectors [16] and partly
from the widespread availability of antimicrobials and an
often weak regulatory framework governing their use in
human and veterinary medicine. Weak regulations en-
able inappropriate usage of antimicrobials which, in the
livestock sector, often manifests as use without proper
diagnosis, poor adherence to dosage and treatment dur-
ation, and use of falsified pharmaceuticals, behaviors that
may favor AMR emergence [17, 18].

Antimicrobials are presumed to be extensively used in
Southeast Asia, but only a few published studies have in-
vestigated practices related to antimicrobial usage in the
large and expanding pig sector in the region [19–22].
These studies indicate uncontrolled and arbitrary use of
antimicrobials with little or no supervision by veterinar-
ians. Concomitantly, other studies have reported high
prevalence of AMR in bacteria isolated from pigs and
poultry in Southeast Asia, with resistance levels as high as
98% to ampicillin [23], 96% to tetracycline [24], and 97%
to gentamicin [25]. Notably, resistance levels have been re-
ported to be higher in pigs than in other species [26, 27].

The present study was undertaken in urban and
peri-urban areas of Cambodia, where availability of

antimicrobials was assumed to be good and in a country
with strong economic growth [28], where regulations gov-
erning the use of veterinary antimicrobials are under devel-
opment, but not yet implemented. The aim was to obtain
information on knowledge, attitudes and practices related
to antimicrobial use in small-scale pig farming in Phnom
Penh, and data on phenotypic AMR in the indicator bac-
teria Escherichia coli isolated from pigs kept by the farming
households. This information could assist in the develop-
ment of strategies for more medically rational use of anti-
microbials in the pig sector, not only in Cambodia but also
elsewhere in the Global South.

Methods
Study area and study population
This cross-sectional study was conducted in urban and
peri-urban areas of Phnom Penh in January and February
2017. Only households keeping pigs under family farm
conditions (FAO, 2014) were targeted for the study,
and thus
farms were excluded.
Cambodian households have a long tradition of raising
animals in their backyards for both subsistence and
commercial purposes, with around 80% of the pigs in
Cambodia still being raised in backyard systems [29].

larger commercial

In recruitment of farms, a list of pig-keeping hou-
seholds (family farms) in the province of Phnom Penh
(n = 267) was available from a previous study [30]. In
that study, snowball sampling [31] had been used with
the ambition to locate all family farms keeping pigs in
Phnom Penh. For the present study, all farms on that list
were visited and included if they still kept pigs and if the
farmers were at home and willing to participate in the
study. However, due to failing profitability from pig pro-
duction, a large proportion of the farms on the list had
stopped keeping pigs since the previous study, and thus
only 81 farms could be included from the previous
study. However, ten farms that had started with pig pro-
duction since the previous study were found during the
fieldwork and were included in the present study.

Study procedure
A semi-structured questionnaire, with questions on farm
characteristics, pig husbandry and routines for anti-
microbial (i.e. antibacterial) use, was administered to the
person responsible for treating sick pigs at the farm. The
questionnaire, which took around 20 min to complete,
was written in English and interviews were carried out
in Khmer with the assistance of the same interpreter
throughout the study. The interpreter, an employee at
the Centre for Livestock and Agriculture Development
(CelAgrid), had extensive knowledge of Cambodian live-
stock production and was familiar with the different
medicines and treatment regimens commonly used in
livestock production in Cambodia. In order to determine

Ström et al. Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control  (2018) 7:35 

Page 3 of 11

whether the drugs referred to by respondents contained
antimicrobials, probing questions were used together with
observations of any medicines, premixes or feed concen-
trates present at the farm.

The questionnaire is provided as supplementary ma-

terial [see Additional file 1].

Collection of fecal samples
Fecal
samples were collected from three randomly
chosen healthy pigs at each farm, using sterile cotton
swabs. At two of the 91 farms, no family member was at
home when the team arrived for sampling and at some
farms only one or two pigs were available for sampling,
resulting in a total of 261 samples from 89 farms. Sam-
ples were collected either from the rectum or from fresh
feces on the ground, if the pig defecated during sample
collection. The swabs were placed in sterile plastic tubes
containing Amies medium (Amies PS Viscose, Sarstedt),
and stored and transported on ice to the National Ani-
mal Health and Production Research Institute (NAHPRI)
in Phnom Penh within 8 h. Samples were stored at
2–8 °C until analysis, which was performed within 48 h
after sampling.

Isolation of E. coli
Fecal sampled were cultured on MacConkey agar at
44 °C overnight. Presumptive E. coli isolates were sub-
cultured on Tryptone Soya Agar (TSA) and incubated at
37 °C overnight. Selected isolates were tested for pro-
duction of tryptophanase (indole). One positive isolate
was selected from each fecal sample, and bacterial ma-
terial was transferred to cryogenic vials containing Luria
Broth (LB) and 20% glycerol, and stored at − 70 °C be-
fore being transported to the Swedish University of
Agricultural Sciences (SLU), Uppsala, Sweden.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
Susceptibility testing was performed at SLU by broth
microdilution, using the growth method for inoculum
preparation, according to the standards described by the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [32]. Prior to
analysis, all isolates were confirmed as E. coli isolates by
matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).

Microdilution susceptibility panels (Sensititre™ EUVSEC,
Thermo Scientific) were used to determine susceptibility of
the bacteria isolates to 14 antimicrobials (ampicillin, azi-
thromycin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, chloramphenicol, cip-
rofloxacin, colistin, gentamicin, meropenem, nalidixid acid,
sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, tigecycline, trimethoprim).
Escherichia coli CCUG 17620 was used as a quality control
strain.

The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for each
antimicrobial was visually determined and epidemiological

cut-off values (ECOFFs), defined by the European Commit-
tee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing [33], were used
to differentiate between wild-type and non-wild-type strains
of the bacteria isolates, henceforth referred to as susceptible
and resistant, respectively. Multidrug-resistance (MDR) was
defined as isolates resistant to at least three different cat-
egories of the antimicrobials tested [34].

Data management and statistical analysis
Data from the questionnaire responses were transcribed
into Epi Info™ 7 (CDC, Atlanta, GA) following the inter-
views, and were exported on to Microsoft Excel 2010
spreadsheets after the fieldwork was finished.

Statistical analyses were conducted in SAS software 9.4
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Descriptive statistics were
computed to define farm characteristics and to determine
knowledge, attitudes and practices among respondents re-
garding use of antimicrobials. Distributions for continuous
variables were tested for normality using the Shapiro-
Wilks test. Univariable logistic regression and Chi-square
tests were used to examine possible associations between
farm size, education level and management factors, such
as routines related to antimicrobial use. To investigate as-
sociations between farm characteristics, management fac-
tors, age group of pigs and the prevalence of resistance to
different types of antimicrobials, generalized linear mixed
models were used where farm was included as a random
effect, to account for clustering. The confounding variable
‘age group of pigs’ was included in all models as a fixed ef-
fect. The statistical significance level was defined as a two-
tailed P-value ≤0.05 for all models. For the associations
with AMR prevalence, however, all P-values < 0.1 are
presented.

Results
Farm characteristics
Among the 91 farms included in the study, 29 farms (32%)
also kept cattle and 64 farms (70%) kept poultry, besides
keeping pigs. The number of pigs present in at the farm at
the time of the visits ranged from 2 to 228 with a median
of 20 pigs (5th and 95th percentiles: 7 and 81 pigs). The
farm with 228 pigs was a farm that produced piglets to sell
on to other producers, which explains its much higher
number of pigs compared with the other farms.

Male household heads had in general attained a higher
level of education than female household heads (P < 0.001).
A high level of education was defined as commencing, but
not necessarily completing, studies at upper secondary
school, which was achieved by 31% of male and 9% of
female farmers.

Antimicrobial use
At 60 farms (66%), the male household head was respon-
sible for treating sick animals while the female household

head was responsible at 15 farms (16%) and the veterinar-
ian or village animal health worker at nine farms (10%).
At the remaining farms (8%), another household member
(than the household heads) had the responsibility for
treatment. The age of the person responsible for treating
sick pigs (not including veterinarians or animal health
workers) varied between 20 and 68 years, with a mean of
44 years. At 78 farms (86%) antimicrobials were routinely
administered to the pigs to treat an existing disease, as a
prophylactic for piglets or sows after farrowing, or as a
feed additive commonly included in the feed concentrate.
At nine farms (10%), however, it could not be determined
with certainty that antimicrobials were used, as the re-
spondent did not remember the names of the drugs used,
and no drug packages were present. Nonetheless, all these
farmers reported that they received drugs from veterinar-
ians or pharmaceutical companies for treatment. Based on
the respondents’ descriptions of disease symptoms and
treatment regimens, we concluded that these farmers
most likely administered antimicrobials to the pigs. Only
four farmers (4%) reported that they did not use any anti-
microbials, of which three farmers explained that their
pigs had not been sick in a long time, while one farmer
explained that they had stopped treatment with antimi-
crobials because their pigs died the last time they received
antimicrobial treatment.

they used. Furthermore,

At least 70 different brands of antimicrobial drugs were
used by the farmers. The antimicrobials most commonly
mentioned or kept by the respondents were amoxicillin,
tylosin, gentamicin and colistin (Table 1). Most respon-
dents, however, could only name some of the antimicrobials
that
the majority of piglet-
producing farms gave the new-born piglets iron supple-
ments, although only 24 respondents (26%) could specify
or show the type of supplement used. Of these, eight
farmers (33%) used iron supplements that contained anti-
microbials, commonly gentamicin or colistin, in combin-
ation with tylosin, streptomycin or spectinomycin.

At least 14 farmers reported to routinely administer
antimicrobials to the pigs as a preventive measure
(Table 2). However, the antimicrobial content in the feed
concentrate is not included in this figure and compre-
hensive information regarding the contents of the iron
supplements administered could not be retrieved. At
least 37% of the farms routinely used a concentrate that
contained antimicrobials, although the types and con-
centrations of the antimicrobials were only specified on
the concentrates used at three farms. It was commonly
the concentrate for younger pigs (as advised by the
manufacturer) that contained antimicrobials.

The respondents reported that they commonly re-
ceived antimicrobials from the veterinarian or village
animal health worker. Most veterinarians either oper-
ated a pharmaceutical store or were employed by a

pharmaceutical company. Respondents described unre-
stricted access to antimicrobials, and professional prior
diagnosis of the animals seemed to be rarely practiced.
Many respondents explained that they just went to the
store and described the disease symptoms to acquire
antimicrobials from the veterinarian. Other respon-
dents claimed that they did not necessarily need veter-
inary advice, as
they could decide which type of
antimicrobial and dosage to administer based on previous
experiences. In general, treatment based on experi-
ence was a common practice among the farmers. On at
least 60 farms (66%), the respondent reported frequently
deviating from the instructions provided by veterinarians
or written on product labels, by adjusting both dosage and
duration of treatment based on the severity of the disease
and whether the animals recovered quickly or not.
Respondents that reported this behavior were also more
likely to use human antimicrobials on their pigs
(P = 0.056). Furthermore, almost half of
the respon-
dents (47%) reported that they did not adhere to the
withdrawal period stated on drug packaging or prescribed
by the veterinarian, and pigs were often sold for slaughter
during or directly after antimicrobial treatment. None of
the behaviors described above was associated with the
level of education of the household head.

Knowledge and attitudes about antimicrobials and AMR
Only one respondent (a former animal health worker)
explained that he knew what antimicrobials were and
their mode of action. For the other respondents, their

healthy (Table 3). All respondents save two considered
antimicrobials to be easily accessible. It should be noted
that these two respondents stated either that antimicro-
bials were often sold out when they arrived at the store,
or that it was difficult to find ‘high quality antimicro-
bials’ from Europe. The latter was mentioned by other
respondents too and some expressed concerns that
locally produced antimicrobials (commonly imported from
Vietnam) were not as efficient as antimicrobials imported
from European countries.

Around half of the respondents (55%) stated that they
had heard of the term ‘antimicrobial resistance’. This
was more likely among respondents who had attained a
higher level of education (78% vs. 49%; P = 0.036; Odds
ratio (OR) 3.6; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.1–12.0)
and was more often reported by male respondents (74%
vs. 39%; P < 0.001; OR 4.4; CI 1.8–10.9), and by farms
where the respondent was the person responsible for
treating sick pigs (65% vs. 41%; P = 0.021; OR 2.7;
CI 1.6–6.4). Some respondents elaborated on this ques-
tion and gave examples from their own experience of what
they believed to be AMR (Table 4).

recover”

Male, 35 years, lower education

Although many respondents had heard about AMR,
when asked to state some possible negative conse-
quences from the use of antimicrobials none mentioned
this as a potential problem. Still, respondents expressed
some concerns about other possible adverse effects that
could arise from antimicrobial use, for example the risk
of antimicrobial residues being present in the meat and
potential negative effects on the animals when they re-
ceived too much antimicrobials (Table 5).

Antimicrobial susceptibility in E. coli
Escherichia coli bacteria were successfully isolated from
all 261 samples, of which 110 were obtained from
growers (1–3 months old), 122 were obtained from fat-
teners (over 3 months old), and 29 were obtained from
sows. Overall, bacteria isolates were resistant to a median
of five of the 13 antimicrobials tested (no ECOFF was
available for azithromycin). Twenty-one isolates (8%)
were susceptible to all antimicrobials, whereas 31 isolates
(12%) showed resistance to eight or more antimicro-
bials. Among all isolates tested, resistance levels were

79% of all isolates. Isolates from growers showed higher
prevalence of resistance to all antimicrobials compared
with isolates from fatteners (Fig. 1), although this differ-
ence was only significant for AMP, CHL, COL and
SMX, and for MDR. Furthermore, isolates from sows
showed significantly higher prevalence of resistance to
CIP and NAL, compared with isolates from fatteners.

Antimicrobial use, farm characteristics and associations
with AMR
The
associations
between farm characteristics, practices related to anti-
microbial use and the prevalence of resistance to the
antimicrobials tested. Age of the person responsible for
antimicrobial treatment was positively related to lower
prevalence of resistance to CIP (P = 0.043) and SMX
(P = 0.021), and to MDR (P = 0.029). Isolates from pigs
owned by farmers who had attained a higher level of
education showed a higher prevalence of resistance to CIP
(P = 0.007) and NAL (P = 0.053), and to MDR (P = 0.024).
There was no correlation between age of the farmer and
level of education. Higher prevalence of resistance was
also found for NAL (P = 0.031), TMP (P = 0.004) and
SMX (P = 0.023), and for MDR (P = 0.089) in isolates from
farms where a veterinarian was responsible for antimicro-
bial treatment. Furthermore,
isolates from farms where
antimicrobials were administered preventatively showed
higher prevalence of resistance to AMP (P = 0.081), CIP
(P = 0.072), CHL (P = 0.056), SMX (P = 0.028) and TMP
(P = 0.031), and farms that often treated the entire
group of pigs instead of only the sick individuals had
a higher prevalence of resistance to CIP (P = 0.021),
COL (P = 0.048) and NAL (P = 0.012). Finally,
farms
that reported routinely using feed supplements that
contained antimicrobials had a higher prevalence of
resistance to AMP (P = 0.070), CIP (P = 0.076), CHL
(P = 0.015), SMX (P = 0.031) and TMP (P = 0.016). For
farms where it could be concluded that the concen-
trate included antimicrobials, the prevalence of resist-
ance to CHL (P = 0.068) was higher.

Discussion

production. Overall, knowledge regarding antimicrobial
use appeared to be low among the respondents and few
reported having received any training in veterinary prac-
tices. Antimicrobial use was mainly based on pig-keepers’
experiences and on drug sellers’ advices according to
symptoms described by the owner, rather than being
based on professional diagnostics. Similar practices have
been reported in other studies conducted in the region
[20, 21]. In the present study, we frequently found labels
on the veterinary antimicrobials in languages other than

Khmer, such as English, Vietnamese or Spanish. Addition-
ally,
labelling on concentrate packaging and feed pre-
mixes did not always specify the type and concentration of
the antimicrobial content. This prevents farmers and re-
tailers from making informed decisions on which drugs to
choose and may contribute to inappropriate use of antimi-
crobials in livestock farming in Cambodia.

In agreement with other studies in Southeast Asia
[23, 24, 27] we found a high prevalence of resistance to
ampicillin,
tetracycline and chloramphenicol, probably

reflecting a long tradition of use in livestock farming
in the region. The high prevalence of resistance to colistin,
especially among growers,
is a particular concern, as
colistin is considered a last-resort antimicrobial for treat-
ment of severe human infections and its use in livestock
production may contribute to emerging resistance glo-
bally. The high prevalence of resistance detected in this
study most likely results from the widespread use of co-
listin, either for treatment ofdiseases or as a prophylactic
for piglets. We also found high prevalence of resistance
to the quinolone ciprofloxacin, an antimicrobial not
licensed for veterinary use. This is probably explained by

cross-resistance with other veterinary quinolones, such as
enrofloxacin [35], an antimicrobial commonly used by
the farms in the present study. Notably, higher preva-
lence of AMR was found on farms that reported admin-
istering antimicrobials as a prophylactic and on farms
that normally treated the entire group or herd in the
event of disease. These results support the claim that
non-rational use of antimicrobials contributes to increased
prevalence of AMR [5].

We found that bacteria isolated from growers (1–
3 months) exhibited significantly higher prevalence of re-
sistance to several of the antimicrobials tested, including

MDR, than bacteria from fatteners (older than 3 months).
Higher prevalence of AMR in younger pigs has been re-
ported in other cross-sectional studies [36, 37]. A longitu-
dinal study by Nguyen et al. [19] presented similar results
where the prevalence of resistance to ciprofloxacin and
gentamicin, as well as MDR, in E. coli declined during the
rearing process. The decreasing prevalence of AMR is
suggested to be the result of reduced use of antimi-
crobials during the finishing phase of pig production
and may also reflect the potential fitness cost of re-
sistance in bacteria from the intestinal tract [38]. In
the present study, however, isolates from sows exhib-
ited significantly higher prevalence of resistance than
isolates from fatteners for several of the antimicro-
bials tested. One explanation might be that sows (and
also younger pigs) receive oral antimicrobials to a
higher extent than older pigs, as oral administration of
antimicrobials has been reported to increase AMR in
commensal E. coli from pigs [39]. Animal age might thus
be an important factor to consider when investigating
prevalence of AMR in pigs.

Two thirds of the farmers reported frequently deviating
from the instructions provided by veterinarians or those
written on drug packaging. Common practices were to
stop administering antimicrobials as soon as the animals
started to recover, hence not completing the treatment,
and to self-adjust the dosage based on the severity of the
disease. Poor adherence to recommended instructions
may increase the risk of AMR [17, 18] and has been re-
ported to be a common problem in countries with non-
prescription access to antimicrobials [40]. A particular
concern is the use of human antimicrobials as a last-line
treatment and the handling of expired antimicrobials,
where almost half of the respondents stated that they
commonly dumped the remaining pharmaceuticals in the
environment once the expiry date had passed. This im-
plies that discarded antimicrobials may be present locally
at high concentrations in the environment, where they
may contribute to resistance development [41, 42].

that

Improper and unregulated use of antimicrobials may
pose a risk to public health if antimicrobial residues are
present in animal products. Nearly half of the respon-
dents in the present study reported that pigs were com-
monly sold during or directly after antimicrobial
treatment,
is within the prescribed withdrawal
time. If withdrawal times are not respected there is a
risk of antimicrobial residues remaining in the meat at
In many low- and middle-income
slaughter
countries, compliance with withdrawal
times is not
monitored and analysis of animal products is not
routinely practiced. Studies in Vietnam, however, have
found tetracycline [44] and sulfamethazine [45] residues
in 5.5 and 8.8%, respectively, of pork meat sampled
at local markets.

[43].

The prevalence of resistance to several antimicrobials,
including MDR, was lower on farms operated by an
older farmer, possibly as a consequence of more experi-
enced farmers having better disease control practices, as
previously suggested by Nhung et al. [27]. Notably, farms
on which a veterinarian was responsible for antimicro-
bial treatment had a higher prevalence of resistance to
several of the antimicrobials tested, including MDR. This
is a concern, as veterinary supervision is a measure often
put forward when discussing ways to improve antimicro-
bial treatment regimens. It is possible that these farmers
relied on a veterinarian for treatment as a result of
poor knowledge of animal health and veterinary prac-
tices, which in turn might result in deficient disease
control. However, it is also important to consider the
fact
in most countries globally
(including Cambodia) receive a considerable part of
their income from the sale of pharmaceuticals, and
therefore may be reluctant to reduce the use of anti-
microbials in their practice [46]. It is also possible
that these results reflect a need to strengthen veterinary
education in Cambodia.

that veterinarians

Male respondents more often stated that they had
heard about antimicrobial resistance than female re-
spondents. This could be a consequence of men gen-
erally attaining a higher
level of education than
women, or of men most commonly being responsible
for treating sick pigs and therefore probably having
more discussions with veterinarians. The latter sug-
gestion is reinforced by the fact that previous aware-
ness of antimicrobial resistance was more commonly
reported by farms where the respondent was the per-
son responsible for treating sick pigs. Although our
aim was to interview the person responsible, this was
not possible on all
farms. If we had omitted those
farms, we would probably have ended up with far
fewer farms in our study.

When performing surveys that rely on self-reported
practices, there is always the risk of recall bias or of
respondents providing answers that
they think are
‘correct’, but which may not correspond to actual
practices. In the present study, many of the respon-
dents did not remember the names of the drugs they
used and they did not keep any treatment records.
Thus we were unable to determine whether higher
levels of AMR were the result of higher consumption
of certain antimicrobials or to establish any associa-
tions between antimicrobial use
and explanatory
factors, such as farm size or education level.

Conclusions
The emergence of AMR is a truly global issue as it spreads
easily between countries, and excessive and inappropriate
use of antimicrobials should thus be mitigated everywhere.

In the present study, we found that antimicrobial use in
urban and peri-urban pig farming in Cambodia was
commonly only based on farmers’ experiences or on drug
sellers’ advices based on descriptions of symptoms, and
there was low awareness of the risks and consequences of
antimicrobial resistance among the respondents. Com-
mensal E. coli from pigs showed high prevalence of AMR
to several antimicrobials considered to be of critical im-
portance for human medicine, including ampicillin, cipro-
floxacin and colistin, and multidrug-resistance was found
in four out of five samples. Higher prevalence of resistance
was found on farms that administered antimicrobials as a
prophylactic and on farms that treated the entire group or
herd in the event of disease. These results confirm the
hypothesis that non-rational use of antimicrobials results
in higher prevalence of AMR and highlight the need for
professional animal health systems that involve medically
rational use of antimicrobials in emerging economies such
as Cambodia.
