ABSTRACT

This study aimed to investigate classical enterotoxin (sea to see) and mecA genes, by polymerase chain reaction and
anitimicrobial susceptibility, by disk diffusion test of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from minas frescal cheese (MFC). All
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates were investigated for the presence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)
genes and clonal diversity. Thirty-one S. aureus were isolated from four MFC samples. Seven (22.6%) S. aureus carried mecA
gene and two of them carried enterotoxin genes seb/sec and sea/seb. Five (16.1%) S. aureus isolates showed induced
resistance to clindamycin and nine (29%) were resistant to multiple –antibiotics (MDR), among these, six were MRSA. No
MRSA isolates presented the PVL genes. Four MRSA were grouped into three clones and three isolates were not typable by
pulsed field gel electrophoresis. MRSA isolates showed, by multilocus sequence typing, sequence types ST1, ST5, ST72 and
ST4304 (new ST) and S. aureus protein A (spa type) t127, t568 and t2703. These data suggest that MFC may constitute a risk
to the consumer because of its potential for staphylococcal food poisoning; however it might, also, become one of MRSA
and MDR strains disseminator, including clones usually found in the hospital environment.

INTRODUCTION

Staphylococcus spp. colonizes skin and mucous membranes, es-
pecially the nasal-pharyngeal region and gastrointestinal tract
of humans and animals (Wendlandt, Schwarz and Silley 2013).
Foodborne illness caused by Staphylococcus aureus is a poisoning
that happens after ingestion of staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE)
released in food (Le Loir, Baron and Gautier 2003).

Minas frescal cheese (MFC) is one of the most popular
cheeses in Brazil, produced from pasteurized milk, has soft con-
sistency, high water activity, pH around 5.1 to 5.6 and 1.6% NaCl.
MFC is highly perishable, providing conditions for the develop-
ment of many enteropathogenic bacterial species (Gonzalez et al.
2000), including S. aureus (Arcuri et al. 2010).

◦

Staphylococcus aureus releases a variety of extracelular pro-
teins, including several SE, which are resistant to proteolytic
enzymes and heat stable, requiring a temperature of 100
C for
5–10 min to be destroyed. Usually, these enterotoxins are not
completely inactivated by pasteurization and other usual ther-
mal treatments (Le Loir, Baron and Gautier 2003). Staphylococcal
food poisoning generally occurs from strains that produce one
or more of the five classical SEs (SEA to SEE) (Vic¸osa et al. 2013).
The production of SE is correlated with proliferation of the
bacterium in food, so bacterial colonies count is used to deter-
mine the safety of the product. Food poisoning is caused, pre-
dominantly, by coagulase-producing strains (Schelin et al. 2011).
The main coagulase-positive SE-producing species is S. aureus;
however, some other coagulase-positive species such as S. inter-
medius and S. hyicus have also been described in food poisoning
(Martins et al. 2013). Because of this, Brazilian law (Brasil 2001)
establishes the coagulase-positive Staphylococcus (a) (colonies
count) as quality and safety indicator for different types of food.
Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is spread through-
out the world (Wendlandt, Schwarz and Silley 2013), adapt-
ing to different environmental conditions and modulating its
pathogenicity, due to the ability to acquire foreign genes, in-
cluding resistance genes to multiple antibiotics (Moellering
2012). MRSA have been isolated from animal foods in different
countries; however, only a few studies monitor MRSA in food
(Wendlandt, Schwarz and Silley 2013), mainly in dairy prod-
ucts (Basanisi et al. 2017). Monitoring MRSA from food is im-
portant because of the ability of these bacteria to spread multi-
ple antimicrobial resistance genes, turning it into a major public
health problem (Pinchuk, Beswick and Reyes 2010).

This study aimed to isolate S. aureus from MFC and investi-
gate the presence of S. aureus species-specific genes, classical SE
encoding genes, the gene that confers resistance to methicillin
and investigate antimicrobial resistance profile. In addition, the
clonal relationship among MRSA isolates was also determined.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
MFC samples and Staphylococcus aureus isolation

In total, 30 samples of MFC have been analyzed, from different
brands, sold in the city of Niteroi, during the period comprised
between July and September 2012. All MFC samples analyzed
showed the Federal Inspection Service (SIF) registration.

Twenty-five grams of each sample were homogenized in
225 mL of 0.1% peptone water (w/v) (DIFCO). Dilutions were
plated onto Baird-Parker Agar (BP) (DIFCO), supplemented with
egg emulsion and potassium tellurite (Laborclin, Brazil), and in-
cubated at 35±1
◦
C for 24–48 h. Suspect colonies of Staphylococcus
(black colonies surrounded by clear zone) were counted, at least

five colonies were selected and inoculated onto Brain Heart In-
fusion (BHI) broth (DIFCO) and BHI agar (DIFCO) for confirma-
tion and subsequent calculation of the CFU of CoPS per gram
of MFC, as recommended by the Compendium of Methods for
the Microbiological Examination of Foods (Lancette and Bennet
2001). The colonies confirmed as CoPS were stored at –20
C in
triptcase soy broth (TSB) (DIFCO) supplemented with 20% (v/v)
glycerol (KASVI) (TSB-G).

◦

DNA extraction

A total of 10 μL of the bacterial culture in TSB-G has been
◦
inoculated in 5 mL of BHI broth and incubated at 35
C for
18 h. DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Minikit (Qiagen,
Hiden, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s protocol,
−1) and 3 μL of lysostaphin
adding 30 μL of lysozyme (20 mg mL
(10 mg mL

−1).

Polymerase chain reaction

DNA was used as template to search for 16S rRNA gene, spe-
cific for the genus Staphylococcus (Zhang et al. 2004); nuc gene, en-
coding the thermonuclease enzyme specific for S. aureus species
(Gandra et al. 2011); sea, seb, sec, sed and see genes, encoding for
the classical SE (Becker, Roth and Petres 1998); mecA gene for me-
thicillin resistance (Oliveira and Lencastre 2002); and luk-S-PV
and luk-F-PV genes (Lina et al. 1999) by polymerase chain reac-
tion (PCR). Genes used, oligonucleotides (Invitrogen, S ˜ao Paulo,
Brazil), cycling conditions, primer concentration and base pair
size are described in Table 1. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923
was used as positive control for 16S rRNA and nuc genes; S.
aureus ATCC 13565, 14458, 19095, 23235 and 27664 for sea, seb,
sec, sed and see genes, respectively; and S. aureus HU25 (BEC)
for mecA. Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and S. epidermidis ATCC
12228 were used as negative control for 16S rRNA and nuc genes,
respectively.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

isolates were evaluated through disk diffusion test on
All
Muller-Hinton agar. The investigated antimicrobial agents were
erythromycin (15 μg), clindamycin (2 μg), sulfamethoxazole-
trimethoprim (25 μg), rifampicin (5 μg), chloramphenicol
(30 μg), linezolid (30 μg), ciprofloxacin (5 μg), penicillin G (10 U),
oxacillin (1 μg), tetracycline (30 μg), gentamicin (10 μg) and ce-
foxitin (30 μg) (Sensibiodisc, CECOM, Brazil) (Fig. S1, Supporting
Information). The isolates resistant to erythromycin and sen-
sitive to clindamycin were evaluated for resistance induced by
clindamycin through D-Test (CLSI 2014) (Fig. S2, Supporting In-
formation).

Pulse-field gel electrophoresis

DNA of all MRSA isolates was digested with five units of SmaI
◦
(Invitrogen) restriction endonuclease for 18 h at 30
C. Restriction
fragments were separated by 1% (w/v) agarose gel (Molecular
Biology Certified agarose, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA,
USA) in a pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) system (CHEF
DR-III, BioRad), with an initial pulse time of 1 s and final of

Multilocus sequence typing

MRSA isolates were typed through multilocus sequence typing
(MLST) as described previously (Enright et al. 2000). We con-
ducted MLST analysis by sequencing fragments of the PCR prod-
uct of seven house-keeping genes (arcC, aroE, glpF, gmk, pta, tpi
and yqiL) (Table 1). DNA sequences of PCR product from each
of the seven genes were assembled in SeqMan (Lasergene 8,
DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA), and allele number and sequence
types (ST) were assigned by using the S. aureus MLST website
(https://pubmlst.org/saureus/).

Staphylococcal protein A (spa) typing

We conducted PCR using oligonucleotides (Invitrogen)
for
spa (staphylococcal protein A gene) typing (Table 1) of all
MRSA isolates. DNA sequencing was performed accord-
ing to Shopsin et al.
(1999). Sequences were grouped in

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Staphylococcus aureus in the MFC

Staphylococcal food poisoning is caused predominantly by
strains producing the enzyme coagulase (Schelin et al. 2011). In
view of this, Brazilian legislation (Brasil 2001), as well as Euro-
pean legislation (European Union 2005), establishes CoPS count
as an indicator of quality and safety for cheese. From 30 MFC
samples analyzed, CoPS were identified in four (13.3%) samples
(Q5, Q18, Q24 and Q28), of different manufacturers, acquired
in different commercial establishments. Three (10%) samples
(Q5, Q24 and Q28) showed CoPS above the standard (5.0 × 102
CFU/g) established by Brazilian law (Brasil 2001). Staphylococcus
aureus is very vulnerable to destruction by heating and sanitizing
agents, so its presence in processed foods is usually indicative of
poor hygiene and/or deficient pasteurization (Le Loir, Baron and

Gautier 2003). Furthermore, it is already known that human skin
and nasal mucosa act as reservoirs of S. aureus, resulting as
the main source of food contamination (Wendlandt, Schwarz
and Silley 2013). MFC is a much-manipulated cheese and the
samples analyzed in this study were produced from pasteur-
ized milk. Thus, we suggest that the contamination of MFC may
have occurred as result of failure in the pasteurization of milk,
poorly cleaned equipment or mainly manipulation hygiene
failure.

Thirty-one CoPS were isolated and all isolates were con-
firmed as S. aureus by 16S rRNA and nuc gene PCR (Table S1, Sup-
porting Information). The nuc gene encodes the thermonucle-
ase enzyme and has been used as a valuable genetic marker for
rapid identification of S. aureus.

Antimicrobial resistance profile

There were S. aureus isolates presenting a wide spectrum of an-
timicrobial resistance profile. All isolates of S. aureus were re-
sistant to penicillin, 21 (67.74%) to erythromycin, 12 (38.71%)
to ciprofloxacin, 4 (12.9%) to clindamycin, 4 (12.9%) to oxacillin
and cefoxitin, 2 (6.45%) to rifampicin, 1 (3.23%) to chlorampheni-
col and 1 (3.23%) to tetracycline. All isolates were susceptible
to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, gentamicin and linezolid
(Table S1). Staphylococcus aureus showed a high rate of resis-
tance to penicillin (Yucel, Citak and Bayh ¨un 2011). However, S.
aureus penicillin-sensitive has been isolated from food (Oliveira
et al. 2016). In general, a great percentage of erythromycin and
ciprofloxacin resistance is observed (Yucel, Citak and Bayh ¨un
2011).

Staphylococcal enterotoxins

MRSA isolates

The main importance of staphylococci in foods is its ability to
produce SE, leading to food poisoning; therefore, its search is im-
portant, regarding the risk for human health (Pinchuk, Beswick
and Reyes 2010). In Brazil, staphylococcal food poisoning is one
of three most common foodborne diseases (Brasil 2017). Most
cases of staphylococcal food-poisoning outbreaks occur due to
production of classical SE (Vic¸osa et al. 2013). In this study, two
(6.5%) isolates of S. aureus, CH276 and CH280, presented the
SE genes seb/sec and sea/seb, respectively (Table 2; Table S1).
Higher percentages of enterotoxigenic S. aureus isolated from
dairy products have been described in Brazil (Arcuri et al. 2010)
and other countries (Rosengren et al. 2010). MFC is a ready-to-
eat-food, which raises concerns, as this fact enhances the like-
lihood of food poisoning. SEA seems to be the most common
SE implicated in staphylococcal food poisoning (Rosengren et al.
2010). Studies have shown the relationship between the source
of contamination and the type of SE produced by S. aureus. SEA
and SEB are associated with contamination of human origin,
whereas SEC and SED are related to contamination from ani-
mals (Pinchuk, Beswick and Reyes 2010). However, S. aureus SEC-
producing isolates have also been related to human contamina-
tion. In the USA, Jones et al. (2002) identified a handler colonized
by MRSA as a source of contamination of a food-poisoning out-
break in which the strains involved were characterized as SEC
producers. The results presented in this study allow us to spec-
ulate that contamination of the MFC sample by S. aureus might
have had human origin.

CLSI (2014) establishes, for S. aureus, the use of cefoxitin disk (30
μg) to detect oxacillin resistance mediated by mecA gene. How-
ever, this method is often not sufficiently sensitive or specific;
therefore, the detection of the mecA gene is applied and con-
sidered the gold standard for MRSA identification (CLSI 2014).
Seven (22.6%) S. aureus presented the mecA gene, being classi-
fied as MRSA, were isolated from one (3.3%) MFC sample (Q28),
but not all isolates showed oxacillin and cefoxitin resistance
phenotype (Table 2, Table S1). Several studies have shown vary-
ing accuracies in the identification of MRSA strains by disk dif-
fusion method using cefoxitin and oxacillin, and this event is
attributed to the heterogeneous expression of resistance (Mo-
hanasoundaram and Lalitha 2008). Thus, we suggest the inclu-
sion of mecA gene search for identification of MRSA from food.
MRSA have been isolated from animal, raw milk and
raw meat in different countries, including Brazil (Wendlandt,
Schwarz and Silley 2013; Oliveira et al. 2016; Basanisi et al. 2017);
however, few studies have been conducted to MRSA detection
from dairy products, including cheese made from pasteurized
milk. Normanno et al. (2007), in Italy, isolated MRSA from 1.3%
of dairy products. Rodr´ıguez-L ´azaro et al. (2015) investigated 195
samples of different foods confiscated from passengers flying to
the USA, where they identified MRSA in 9.1% of the samples (one
cheese). In another study, Basanisi et al. (2017) reported 8.3% of
strains of S. aureus isolated from milk and dairy products were
MRSA. In Brazil, Silveira-Filho et al. (2014), studying milk and
dairy products, did not find any MRSA strain.

D-test

Five (16.1%) S. aureus isolates presented induced resistance to
clindamycin, observed by the D-test; among these, three were
MRSA (mecA-positive, oxacilin- and cefoxitin-sensitive) (Table 3,
Table S1). The increase in infections caused by Staphylococ-
cus spp. and the change in resistance profiles of these iso-
lates has led to the use of clindamycin for the treatment of
MRSA and MSSA (methicillin-sensitive S. aureus) infections.
D-test is an important laboratory test to aid in the effective use
of clindamycin for staphylococcal infections that present the
MLSBi (macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin resistance
inducible pattern) phenotype, and thus avoid therapeutic fail-
ures in clinical practice (Martinez-Aguilar et al. 2003).

Multidrug resistant

Isolates presenting resistance to three or more antimicrobial
classes were classified as multidrug resistant (MDR; Magiorakos
et al. 2012). A total of nine (29%) isolates were classified as MDR
(Table 3, Table S1). MRSA strains are usually MDR pathogens
(Pinchuk, Beswick and Reyes 2010); however, MRSA CH279 iso-
late showed only resistance to penicillin and erythromycin
(Table 3, Table S1), not being classified as MDR, which is a com-
mon feature found among isolates classified as CA-MRSA (Van-
denesch et al. 2003). Multiresistant bacteria are a major public
health problem, and food is a possible transmitter of these mi-
croorganisms to humans and environment (Pinchuk, Beswick
and Reyes 2010). The presence of antibiotic resistance in poten-
tially pathogenic bacteria isolated from foods of animal origin
justifies further research into the role of antimicrobial agents.

Panton-Valentine leukocidin toxin

MRSA isolates were investigated for the presence of the luk-S and
luk-F-PV genes. Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes were
not observed in any MRSA isolates (Table 2). These genes, en-
coding PVL toxin, are usually observed in CA-MRSA (community-
associated MRSA) (Vandenesch et al. 2003). However, data indi-
cate that PVL is not always present in CA-MRSA isolates (Zhang
et al. 2008), especially in Brazil (Carvalho, Berezin and Mimica
2012).

Clonal diversity

MRSA mecA-positive oxacillin/cefoxitin-resistant isolates pre-
sented three different PFGE profiles (Fig. S3, Supporting

Information) and were grouped into three clonal groups: A, B
and C. MRSA mecA-positive oxacillin/cefoxitin-susceptible iso-
lates were non-typeable by PFGE (Table 2). Using the criteria es-
tablished by Tenover et al. (1995), isolates belonging to clone
A have 82% similarity with clone B isolates (CH273), whereas
clones A and B have 79% similarity with clone C (CH280) (Fig.
S4, Supporting Information).

According to MLST, MRSA isolates showed four different se-
quence types (ST1, ST5, ST72 and ST4304) (Table 2, Table S2,
Supporting Information). Four isolates were grouped into three
different spa typing (t127, t568 and t2703) and three isolates pre-
sented unknown spa typing (Table 2). MRSA ST1, ST5 and ST72
have been isolated in hospitals in Brazil (Schuenck et al. 2009;
Matos et al. 2016), MRSA ST4304 is a new allele deposited in
the S. aureus MLST database (https://pubmlst.org/saureus/), with
ID32918. In Korea, nasal MRSA ST72 was predominant in pa-
tients newly admitted to hospitals (Park et al. 2016). Based on
the genotyping methods used, six different clones were identi-
fied among the seven MRSA isolates from the same cheese. Iso-
lates with the same ST were differentiated through spa typing.
Song et al. (2015) reported that spa typing seems to present better
resolution than MLST. The PFGE and spa typing methodologies
presented correlation (Table 2).

MRSA isolates belonging to clones B (CH276; ST1, t127) and
C (CH280; ST5, t568) were also enterotoxigenic (Table 2). Isolates
showing ST1 and ST5 have been related to staphylococcal food
poisoning (Fetsch et al. 2014). In China, S. aureus ST5 was preva-
lent among enterotoxin-producing strains isolated from differ-
ent foods, including MRSA (Chang et al. 2016). These authors sug-
gest strains of S. aureus ST5 tend to have great ability to produce
enterotoxins, in addition to present increased antimicrobial
resistance.

Isolation of MRSA from MFC indicates that health service in-
spection should give special attention to this food, since S. aureus
are known to cause serious systemic infections. Even though
rarely reported, food can be a vehicle for systemic staphylococ-
cal infections (Yucel, Citak and Bayh ¨un 2011). Kluytmans et al.
(1995) described a severe outbreak of MRSA infection in im-
munocompromised individuals, who consumed contaminated
food by the handler. During this specific outbreak, five deaths oc-
curred. The treatment of MRSA infections is difficult and costly,
thereby effective control to the production of MFC must be per-
formed to prevent contamination, and thus the spread of these
strains through food.

The application of suitable hygiene procedures, with the
adoption of Good Manufacturing Practices Program, in the pro-
duction of food, is essential to promote satisfactory results

regarding the quality of the final product. In conclusion, MFC
can offer potential risk to consumers and community health.
Staphylococcus aureus isolates showed different antimicrobial re-
sistance profiles. MRSA and MDR in MFC indicate the spread
of resistant strains to various environments; in addition, the
presence of strains carrying SE shows the pathogenic poten-
tial of these bacteria. Currently, the displacement of people and
food between different regions is easy and fast. People who are
contaminated with enterotoxigenic S. aureus or MDR or MRSA
strains, through the MFC consumed in Brazil, can, in less than
24 hours, take this strain to any part of the planet. Thus, glob-
alization can make the contamination of a regional food into
a global health problem. MFC samples used in this study have
been contaminated by different clones, including those related
to hospital environment, indicating the contamination from dif-
ferent sources, or even at different times of processing. In order
to develop strategies to prevent staphylococcal food poisoning,
as well as to control food contamination by strains resistant to
multiple antimicrobials, it is important to investigate S. aureus
in food, especially in ready-to-eat dairy products.
