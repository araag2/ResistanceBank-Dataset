  ABSTRACT   The aim of the current study was to de-
termine  the  virulence  factors,  serogroups,  and  anti-
biotic  resistance  properties  of  Shiga  toxin-producing 
Escherichia coli isolated from chicken meat samples. A 
total of 422 chicken meat samples were collected from 
5 townships of Iran. Specimens were immediately trans-
ferred to the laboratory in a cooler with an ice pack. 
Samples  were cultured,  and  the  positive culture sam-
ples were analyzed by PCR assays. Finally, the antimi-
crobial susceptibility test was performed using the disk 
diffusion method in Mueller–Hinton agar. According to 
the results, out of 422 samples, 146 (34.59%) were con-
firmed to be E. coli positive and among E. coli-positive 
samples,  51  (34.93%)  and  31  (21.23%)  were  from  at-
taching and effacing E. coli (AEEC) and enterohemor-
rhagic  E.  coli  (EHEC)  subgroups,  respectively.  All  of 
the EHEC-positive samples had all stx1, eaeA, and ehly
virulence genes, whereas only 5 (9.80%) of AEEC sub-
group had all stx1, stx2, and eaeA genes. As the data 

revealed, O157 was the most prevalent and O111 was 
the least prevalent strains in the Shiga toxin-producing 
E. coli (STEC) population. Among STEC strains, sulI
and blaSHV had the highest and lowest incidence rate, 
respectively. There was a high resistance to tetracycline 
(76.82%),  followed  by  chloramphenicol  (73.17%)  and 
nitrofurantoin (63.41%), but there was low resistance to 
cephalotine (7.31%) antibiotics in isolated strains. Re-
sults shows that the PCR technique has a high perfor-
mance for detection of serogroups, virulence genes, and 
antibiotic resistance genes in STEC strains. This study 
is the first prevalence report of detection of virulence 
genes, serogroups, and antibiotic resistance properties 
of STEC strains isolated from chicken meat samples in 
Iran. Based on the results, chicken meat is one of the 
main sources of STEC strains and its virulence factors 
in Iran, so an accurate meat inspection would reduce 
disease outbreaks. 


  INTRODUCTION 

Escherichia coli is a gram-negative, rod-shaped, flag-
ellated, nonsporulating, and facultative anaerobic bac-
terium that belongs to Enterobacteriaceae family. Some 
serogroups of E. coli are able to cause disease and food 
poisoning. These types of E. coli are generally classi-
fied into 6 subgroups including enterotoxigenic E. coli
(ETEC),  enteropathogenic  E.  coli  (EPEC),  entero-
invasive  E.  coli,  enterohemorrhagic  E.  coli  (EHEC), 
enteroadherent  E.  coli,  and  diffusely  adherent  E.  coli
(Holko et al., 2006). The EHEC strains are one of the 
subsets of Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing E. coli (STEC) 
strains,  which  are  isolated  from  patients  and  are  re-
sponsible for severe clinical symptoms such as hemor-

rhagic colitis (HC) and the potentially lethal hemolytic 
uremic syndrome (HUS; Karch et al., 2005; Karmali et 
al.,  2010).  The  STEC  serogroups  associated  with  hu-
man  diseases  are  numerous  and  include  O1,  O2,  O4, 
O5,O6,  O22,  O23,  O26,  O38,  O45,  O48,  O50,  O55, 
O73, O75, O91, O100, O103, O104, O105, O111, O113, 
O114,  O115,  O117,  O118,  O119,  O121,  O125,  O126, 
O128, O132, O145, O153, O163, O165, and O166, as 
well as untypeable isolates (DebRoy et al., 2004; Hei-
jnen and Medema, 2006; Erickson and Doyle, 2007; Lin 
et al., 2011). Several studies showed that consumption 
of  contaminated  food  with  STEC  strains  is  the  main 
cause of human infections (Mead et al., 1999; Caprioli 
et al., 2005; Hussein and Sakuma, 2005). It seems that 
STEC virulence genes have a major role in causing dis-
eases. Shiga toxins, the main virulence factors contrib-
uting  to  pathogenicity,  consist  of  2  major  types,  the 
Stx1, which is identical to Stx of Shigella dysenteriae, 
and Stx2, which is 56% homologous to Stx1 (Scheutz 
and Strockbine, 2005). On the other hand, the Stx is 
a family of cytotoxic proteins that  consists  of an ap-

1305

proximately  32-kDa  A  subunit,  with  N-glycosidase 
activity,  noncovalently  associated  with  a  pentamer  of 
B subunits (7.7 kDa each), which mediate binding to 
specific  receptor  molecules  (O’Loughlin  and  Robins-
Browne, 2001). The Stx genes are carried by temperate 
lambdoid bacteriophages, along with late genes of the 
phage  genome,  and  are  regulated  by  the  phage  regu-
latory circuits (Schmidt, 2001; Waldor and Friedman, 
2005). Induction of phage by agents that affect bacte-
rial DNA or the cell wall, including antibiotics, can lead 
to a massive increase in toxin production (Kimmitt et 
al., 2000). The Stx1, but not Stx2 and its variants, is 
iron  regulated,  with  enhanced  synthesis  occurring  in 
low-iron environments.

Additional factors that contribute to virulence have 
also been described, including intimin (encoded by the 
eaeA gene), an outer membrane protein involved in the 
attachment  of  E.  coli  to  the  enterocyte,  and  EHEC 
hemolysin (encoded by EHEC hlyA), which acts as a 
pore-forming cytolysin and causes damage to cells (Pa-
ton  and  Paton,  1998).  On  the  other  hand,  a  critical 
component  is  the  gene  that  encodes  the  outer  mem-
brane protein intimin, which functions as an adhesin. 
Variation in the amino acid sequence in the C-terminus 
of intimin has led to recognition of at least 21 variants 
of intimin in STEC and EPEC. A factor that may also 
affect  the  virulence  of  STEC  strains  is  the  enterohe-
molysin  (Ehly),  also  called  enterohemorrhagic  E.  coli 
hemolysin (EHEC-HlyA), which is encoded by the ehxA 
gene (Schmidt et al., 1995). The Ehly operon is posi-
tively regulated by GrlA, a LEE-encoded positive regu-
lator of the LEE operon (Saitoh et al., 2008). Antibody 
to Ehly is produced in humans with EHEC disease and 
experimental data suggest that the hemolysin may aid 
survival of STEC in the intestine by making iron avail-
able from lysis of erythrocytes.

The genes located in the genome of temperate bac-
teriophages encode 2 distinct stx genes. The Stx1 and 
Stx2 toxins possess similar biological activities, includ-
ing  cytotoxicity  to  Vero  and  HeLa  cells,  but  are  dif-
ferent  immunologically  (Law,  2000).  Both  toxins  are 
composed of an enzymatically active A subunit and a 
pentameric B subunit (Paton et al., 1999; Law, 2000). 
The  intimin  encoded  by  the  eae  gene  located  in  the 
chromosomal locus of enterocyte effacement is involved 
in the intimate attachment of bacteria to enterocytes 
(Schmitt et al., 1991). However, some STEC involved 
in severe diseases do not contain the genetic informa-
tion encoding intimin. Plasmid-encoded virulence fac-
tors are also probably involved in the pathogenicity of 
STEC (Law, 2000).

Basically,  hemolysins  are  encoded  by  polycistronic 
operons, which consist of 4 genes arranged in the or-
der of hly-CABD (Schmidt et al., 1996; Stanley et al., 
1998). The product of the hlyC gene is involved in acti-
vation of the hemolytic toxin, the product of the hlyA 
gene.  The  gene  products  of  hlyB  and  hlyD  together 
with  TolC  are  involved  in  secretion  of  the  hemolysin 

through the bacterial cell wall (Holland et al., 2005). 
α-Hemolysin is a pore-forming cytolysin and serves as a 
virulence factor in intestinal and extraintestinal patho-
genic strains of E. coli. It was suggested that the genes 
encoding α-hemolysin (hlyCABD), which can be found 
on the chromosome and plasmid, were acquired through 
horizontal gene transfer. Plasmid-encoded α-hly is as-
sociated with certain ETEC, STEC, and EPEC strains 
(Burgos and Beutin, 2010).

The  diseases  that  cause  by  E.  coli  need  persistent 
antibiotic  therapy,  but  many  studies  have  been  re-
ported the occurrence of antibiotic resistance (van den 
Bogaard and Stobberingh, 1999; Galland et al., 2001). 
Antibiotic resistance can cause more severe diseases in 
humans  and  animals.  Antibiotic  resistance  in  STEC 
strains is associated with the presences of some anti-
biotic resistance genes (Galland et al., 2001). Chicken 
meat is one of the most popular foods among the Ira-
nian population. However; the epidemiology and preva-
lence  of  STEC  strains  in  chicken  meat  is  essentially 
unknown.  Therefore,  this  study  was  carried  out  for 
molecular characterization and evaluation of antibiotic 
resistance properties in STEC serogroups isolated from 
chicken meat in Iran.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Samples

A total of 422 chicken meat samples were randomly 
purchased  from  the  supermarkets  in  various  parts  of 
Iran including Shahrekord (n = 76), Isfahan (n = 102), 
Kermanshah (n = 81), Yasuj (n = 80), and Ahvaz (n 
= 83) townships from March 2010 to March 2011. All 
samples were from 4-wk-old broiler chickens reared in 
an aviculture. In the present study, the chicken breast 
muscle was used. The external surfaces of chicken meats 
were disinfected with 70% alcohol to minimize surface 
contamination. The pieces of the muscles were collected 
separately into sterile bags using sterile scissors and tis-
sue forceps. All samples were immediately transported 
to the laboratory in cooled boxes. All techniques were 
applied to prevent cross-contamination within and be-
tween townships.

The  surfaces  of  chicken  muscles  were  seared  with 
a  hot  sterile  spatula.  Then  the  muscles  were  incised 
and cultured on 5% sheep blood and MacConkey agar 
(Merck,  Germany)  and  incubated  for  18  to  24  h  at 
37°C. Colonies with the typical color and appearance 
of E. coli were picked and streaked again on blood agar 
plates  and  restreaked  on  EMB  agar  (Merck,  Darm-
stadt,  Germany).  The  green  metallic  sheen  colonies 
were considered to be E. coli. The presumptive colonies 
were  biochemically  tested  for  growth  on  triple  sugar 
iron agar and lysine iron agar, oxidative/fermentative 
degradation of glucose, citrate utilization, urease pro-
duction,  indol  fermentation,  tryptophan  degradation,

glucose  degradation  (methyl  red  test),  and  motility. 
The E. coli isolates were kept in LB/glycerol at −70°C 
(Mooljuntee et al., 2010). The colonies were confirmed 
using PCR based on the detection of 16S rRNA gene 
region of E. coli described by Sabat et al. (2000).

DNA Isolation

Bacterial  strains  were  subcultured  overnight  in  Lu-
ria-Bertani broth (Merck), and genomic DNA was ex-
tracted using a DNA extraction kit (DNP, CinnaGen, 
Tehran, Iran) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions.

Detection of Serogroups, Virulence Factors, 
and Antibiotic Resistance Genes  
of Stx-Producing E. coli

The results of culture method were studied using sev-
eral PCR methods. Table 1 shows the primers used for 
detection of Stx-producing E. coli serogroups, virulence 
genes, and antimicrobial resistant genes. A DNA ther-
mo-cycler (Eppendorf Mastercycler, Eppendorf-Nethel-
Hinz GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) was used in all PCR 
reactions. The amplified products were visualized using 
ethidium bromide staining after gel electrophoresis of 
10  μL  of  the  final  reaction  mixture  in  1.5%  agarose.

Strains of E. coli O157:K88ac:H19, CAPM 5933, and 
E.  coli  O159:H20,  CAPM  6006  were  used  as  positive 
controls.

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing

Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed by 
the Kirby–Bauer disc diffusion method using Mueller–
Hinton  agar  (HiMedia  Laboratories,  Mumbai,  India), 
according  to  the  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards 
Institute  guidelines.  After  incubating  the  inoculated 
plate aerobically at 37°C for 18 to 24 h in an aerobic 
atmosphere, the susceptibility of the E. coli isolates to 
each antimicrobial agent was measured and the results 
were  interpreted  in  accordance  with  interpretive  cri-
teria  provided  by  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards 
Institute (2006). Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was used 
as quality control organism in antimicrobial susceptibil-
ity determination.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical  analysis  was  performed  using  SPSS/16.0 
software  (SPSS  Inc.,  Chicago,  IL)  for  significant  re-
lationships.  The  incidences  of  serogroups,  virulence 
factors,  and  antibiotic  resistance  properties  of  E.  coli 
isolated  from  chicken  meat  samples  were  statistically 
analyzed. Statistical significance was regarded at a P 
value <0.05.

The study population consisted of 422 chicken meats. 
As shown in Table 2, 146 (34.59%) samples were con-
firmed  to  be  E.  coli  positive.  There  were  significant 
differences  (P  <  0.05)  between  presence  of  E.  coli  in 
Shahrekord and Ahvaz city. The highest prevalence of 
E. coli in chicken meat occurred in Ahvaz and the low-
est in Shahrekord. Table 3 indicates the distribution of 
virulence factors of E. coli strains isolated from chicken 
meat in Iran. There were significant differences between 
the presence of attaching and effacing E. coli (AEEC) 
and  EHEC  subgroups  in  chicken  meat  samples  (P  < 
0.05). All of the EHEC-positive samples had stx1, eaeA, 
and ehly virulence genes, whereas the presence of these 
genes  in  AEEC-positive  samples  was  lower.  Table  4 
shows the total prevalence of STEC serogroups isolated 
from chicken meat in different townships. Based on the 
results, O157 had the highest incidence of serogroups, 
whereas O103 had the lowest incidence in STEC strains 
isolated from chicken meat samples in Iran. There were 
significant  differences  (P  <  0.01)  between  the  pres-
ence of O157 and O111, nondetected serogroups with 
O111 and O128 and nondetected serogroups with O45. 
Table  5  shows  the  distribution  of  virulence  genes  in 
STEC serogroups isolated from chicken meat samples. 
There were significant differences (P < 0.01) between 
the presence of stx1 and stx2 and between the presence 
of stx1 with ehly and eaeA with ehly virulence genes. 
There were also significant differences (P < 0.05) be-
tween the presence of stx1 and eaeA.

Table 6 revealed the antibiotic resistance properties 
distribution of STEC serogroups isolated from chicken 
meat in Iran. In total sul1 had the highest (64.63%), 
whereas  blaSHV  had  the  lowest  (3.65%)  incidence  of 
antibiotic resistance genes. Statistical analysis showed 
that resistance of O157 serogroup to sulfonamides had 
significant  differences  (P  <  0.05)  with  β-lactams  and 
ampicillin  antibiotics.  Resistance  of  O26  serogroup 
to  enrofloxacin  exhibited  significant  differences  (P  < 
0.05) in β-lactams. Resistance of 103 serogroup to tet-
racycline, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin had significant 
differences  (P  <  0.05)  with  cephalothin,  ampicillin,

DISCUSSION

Escherichia coli isolates frequently contaminate food 
of animal origin; in our investigation, this microorgan-
ism was recovered from 146 out of 422 (34.59%) tested 
chicken meat samples, and most of isolates showed the 
multiple-resistant  phenotypes.  This  survey  revealed 
that  Ahvaz  city  had  the  highest  prevalence  of  STEC 
strains  isolated  from  chicken  meat  samples.  In  addi-
tion, the sul1 gene had the highest prevalence of antibi-
otic resistance genes. Our study showed that the STEC 
strains isolated from chicken meat had the highest an-
tibiotic  resistance  to  tetracycline.  The  results  of  the 
present study revealed that chicken meat can be easily 
contaminated by E. coli. Preparation of healthy chicken 
meat is very important. We recommend the PCR tech-
nique as an accurate, rapid, and safe method for inspec-
tion of chicken meat. Providing healthy food has been 
considered in many countries, including Taiwan (Chi-
ueh et al., 2001), United States (Barkocy-Gallagher et 
al., 2003), Italy (Caprioli et al., 1993), Switzerland (al-
Saigh et al., 2004), and Germany (Beutin et al., 1994). 
The  high  importance  of  E.  coli  as  a  cause  of  human 
poisoning has been shown in the mentioned countries.

Previous research showed that the STEC strains are 
mostly commensal bacteria in animals, with a high po-
tential for foodborne transmission to humans (Caprioli 
et  al.,  2005).  Escherichia  coli  has  been  isolated  from 
wide ranges of raw foodstuffs including dairy cattle and 
their products (Hussein and Sakuma, 2005), beef cattle 
(Galland et al., 2001), milk (Bürk et al., 2002), meat 
products (Chapman et al., 2001), retail fresh meats and 
poultry (Doyle and Schoeni, 1987), and eggs (Chiueh 
et al., 2001).

Our  results  showed  that  O157  is  the  major  STEC 
serogroup in poultry meat, which is similar to a previ-
ous study in Korea performed on raw ground poultry 
(Henry et al., 2001). The other study in Korea showed 
that 41 of 900 poultry samples (4.6%) were E. coli posi-
tive and there was no O157 serogroup detected (Lee et 
al., 2009). In another Czech study, out of 987 samples, 
22 strains (2.2%) were identified as E. coli O157 and

groups were positive for all stx1, eaeA, and ehly genes; 
in addition, 9.8% of AEEC serogroups were positive for 
all stx1, stx2, and eaeA genes. In another investigation, 
E. coli was isolated from 48% (48/100) of chickens and 
all of these isolates had an eaeA virulence factor (Kilic 
et al., 2007) that was lower than our study (90.19%).

It is well documented that STEC strains vary in their 
capacity  to  cause  serious  diseases  in  humans  or  ani-
mals, and this is associated with the type or amount 
of  stx  produced  (Law,  2000).  Therefore,  the  type  of 
stx toxin produced by STEC isolated from human in-
fections  has  been extensively studied (Schmidt et al., 
1995). In contrast, little is known about stx2 subtype 
frequency and the combination of virulence factors ex-
pressed by STEC from the intestinal tract of healthy 
animals. Besides, the ehly virulence gene acts as a pore-
forming cytolysin on eukaryotic cells. In addition to stx 
and ehly vrulence genes, the eae gene has been isolated 
from the cases of HUS and HC (Law, 2000). Our results 
confirmed the presence of virulence genes including stx, 
eae,  and  ehly  in  chicken  meat.  Therefore,  the  raw  or 
undercooked  consumption  of  these  chicken  meats  can 
cause diseases such as HUS and HC in humans.

Because of the high indiscriminate use of antibiotics, 
especially in veterinary medicine, antibiotic resistance 
against most effective antibiotics has occurred. Several 
programs such as the DANMAP in Denmark and the 
JVARM5 in Japan (Heuer and Hammerun, 2005; Asai 
et al., 2006) have described the resistance to various an-
tibiotic drugs in veterinary medicine. In this study, the 
levels of resistance to some antimicrobial agents (tetra-
cycline, chloramphenicol, and nitrofurantoin) were high 
(63  to  77%).  Therefore,  the  STEC  strains  that  were 
isolated from poultry meat are a potential reservoir of 
antimicrobial resistance genes.

Chloramphenicol and nitrofurantoin are 2 forbidden 
antibiotics. The high presence of resistance to these 2 
antibiotics indicated the irregular and unauthorized use 
of these drugs in veterinary treatment in Iran. Veteri-
narians in many veterinary fields such as large animal 
internal  medicine,  poultry,  and  even  aquaculture  use 

these antibiotics as a basic treatment. Therefore, in a 
very short period of time, antibiotic resistance will ap-
pear.  In  the  same  study  in  Thailand,  E.  coli  isolates 
have  100%  resistance  to  tetracycline,  ampicillin,  and 
erythromycin,  whereas  resistance  to  cephalothin  and 
sulfonamide+trimethoprim was 73.3 and 26.7%, respec-
tively (Mooljuntee et al., 2010). Another study showed 
82.4% resistance of E. coli isolated from broiler chickens 
to tetracycline (Miles et al., 2006). Prescription of tet-
racycline is not recommended in cases of E. coli infec-
tion. To our knowledge, ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin 
are common antibiotics used for E. coli infections, but 
our results showed 36.58 and 46.34% resistance to these 
drugs, respectively, which is in accordance with the pre-
vious study (82% resistance to ciprofloxacin; Akond et 
al., 2009). Another study showed that in some countries 
approximately 300,000 kg of antibiotics are used annu-
ally  on  veterinary  prescriptions  in  animals,  of  which 
10%  is  used  in  poultry  (van  den  Bogaard,  2000).  It 
seems that the high and irregular prescription of antibi-
otics is the major reason for the emergence of antibiotic 
resistance.

Our results showed sul1 (64.63%) had a highest in-
cidence  of  antimicrobial  resistance  genes,  followed  by 
aadA1  (62.19%),  dfrA1  (58.53%),  and  qnr  (56.09%), 
but research in Thailand showed that the presences of 
tetA, CITM, ereA, SHV, sul1, and dhfrV were 90, 93.3, 
73.3, 86.4, 100, and 100%, respectively (Mooljuntee et 
al., 2010). A study in Kenya indicated that tetracycline 
(75.9%) and cotrimoxazole (72.4%) had the highest an-
tibiotic resistances in E. coli isolated from slaughtered 
broiler chickens (Adelaide et al., 2008).

These differences in the levels of antibiotic resistance 
in various countries showed that the resistance proper-
ties of STEC strains closely depend on the geographical 
regions. On the other hand, the antibiotic resistances in 
STEC serogroups isolated from chicken meat samples 
closely depends on antibiotic prescriptions (FDA, 2009; 
APUA, 2010; Wayne et al., 2011). Prescription of an-
tibiotics in various countries is related to common and 
conventional antibiotics that are available.

2Numbers in parentheses in the top row are numbers of positive samples in each serogroup.

Our results showed the high presence of serogroups, 
virulence  factors,  and  multiple  antibiotic-resistant 
properties  of  E.  coli  isolated  from  chicken  meat  sam-
ples. To the authors’ knowledge, excessive prescribing, 
crowding, and poor sanitation are the primary factors 
responsible for the high antibiotic resistance in E. coli 
isolated from chicken meat.

In conclusion, the results of our study revealed that 
the PCR assay as an accurate, safe, and fast diagnostic 
method  for  detection  of  pathogens  in  meat  samples. 
The  veterinarians  should  pay  more  attention  to  anti-
biotic  prescription.  Results  indicated  that  the  E.  coli 
virulence genes especially stx1, stx2, eaeA, and ehly are 
well distributed in poultry meat in investigated regions. 
Besides the O157 and O91 serogroups are the predomi-
nant serogroups of bacterium in chicken meat in Iran. 
Ahvaz city has a high temperature, and this city also 
had the highest prevalence of E. coli in poultry meat 
samples.  Shahrekord  city  has  a  low  temperature,  so 
this city had the lowest prevalence of E. coli in poultry 
meat samples (E. coli is more active in warm places). 
It seems that sanitation conditions, especially in poul-
try slaughterhouses and supermarkets, help to reduce 
the contamination rate of poultry meat. In the current 
conditions in Iran, we suggest applying cephalothin and 
ampicillin for E. coli-infected cases. Finally, to prevent 
antibiotic resistance in bacteria, we have to prescribe 
antibiotics more cautiously in animals and periodically 

use  different  antibiotics,  and  be  able  to  detect  resis-
tance genes and use disk diffusion methods.
