Abstract

Background: Despite of the sanitation measures in municipal abattoirs to reduce contamination, Escherichia coli
continues to be a health hazard. The present study was conducted on 150 apparently healthy slaughtered cattle at
municipal abattoir and in 50 different butcher shops in Hawassa town, Ethiopia. The objectives of the study were
investigating the occurrence and antimicrobial resistance of E. coli O157:H7 isolated from fecal samples, carcasses
swab, contacts surfaces (swabs of meat handlers hands, knife and clothes of meat transporters) as well as from
butcher shops (meat samples, swabs from cutting board swab, butcher men hand and knife surface). E. coli O157:
H7 was isolated and identified using bacteriological culture, biochemical tests and Biolog identification system. All
E. coli O157:H7 isolates were then checked for their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern using eleven selected
antimicrobial discs.
Results: Of the entire set of 630 samples, 2.4% (15/630) (95% CI = 1.3–3.9%) were positive for E. coli O157:H7. When
disaggregated by the sources of the samples, E. coli O157:H7 were prevalent in 2.8% (11 of 390) of the abattoir
samples, of which 4.7% of the fecal sample and 2.7% of the carcass swabs. And E. coli O157:H7 were positive in 1.
7% (4 of 240) of butcher shop specimens of which 2% of meat sample and 3.3% of Cutting board swabs. No
statistically significant difference in the prevalence of E. coli 0157: H7 between sex, origin, and breed of cattle. The
isolated E. coli O157:H7 were found to be100% susceptible to cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, gentamycin, kanamycin and
nalidixic acid.
Conclusion: This study concludes the occurrence of E. coli O157:H7 and the presence of multiple antibiotic
resistance profiles in cattle slaughtered at Hawassa municipal abattoir and retail meat sold at butcher shops. This
indicates high risk to public health especially in Ethiopia where many people consume raw or under cooked meat.
Regulatory control of antibiotics usage in livestock production and pharmaco-epidemiological surveillance in food
animals and animal products is hereby recommended to ensure consumer safety.

Background
Escherichia coli (E. coli) are group of bacteria residing in
the gastrointestinal
tracts of mammals commensally,
often without pathogenic effects to the animals. Most E.
coli strains are also non-pathogenic to humans but de-
tection of E. coli in foods intended for human consump-
tion shows poor
in hygiene during production,
processing or preparation. Ultimately, detection of E. coli
in food is indicative of fecal contamination and presence
of other dangerous pathogenic microorganisms which
can compromise the health and wellbeing of consumers.
In addition to hygienic indicator, some strains of E. coli
are directly pathogenic to humans. The best example is
shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 (STEC
O157) which can cause severe enteric infections. Symp-
toms of STEC O157 infection may include abdominal
pain, bloody diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis and haemo-
lytic uremic syndrome (HUS) [1, 2]. In this respect, nu-
merous sporadic infections and outbreaks caused by
STEC O157 have been reported worldwide in many
countries. The majority of STECO157 infections are
food borne more specifically associated with cattle
sources. Historically, STEC O157 was first linked to out-
breaks of severe bloody diarrhea in 1982, and is often re-
ferred to as a “recently emerged” human pathogen [3].
Microbiologically culture proven E. coli O157 diarrheal
cases have been reported from a number of African
countries including South Africa, Swaziland, Central
African Republic, Kenya, Uganda Gabon, Nigeria and
Ivory Coast [4].

In developing countries,

including Ethiopia, animals
are commonly slaughtered and dressed under un-
hygienic conditions and this further compromises the
microbiological quality and safety of the meat obtained
from the animals [29, 30]. This can consequently risk
the health of consumers. In the presence of all the above

situations, so far there are only few studies which ad-
dressed to assess the prevalence and distribution of E.
coli O157:H7 in humans, animals or in foods of animal
origin in Ethiopia [5–8, 30]. Therefore, the objectives of
the present study were: (i) to isolate and identify E. coli
O157:H7 from cattle feces, carcasses and contact sur-
faces at abattoir and butcher shops, (ii) to determine to
what extent the abattoirs and butcher house environ-
ments serve as sources of E. coli O175:H7 and (iii) to de-
termine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the
isolates.

depicted in Table 1. Of the total 630 samples exam-
ined, 78 were positive for E. coli using selective cul-
ture (C-SMAC) and biochemical
tests (indole and

screening using Rainbow agar
O157, out of 78 isolates 24 of them were found to be
presumptively E. coli O157:H7. Finally, confirmation
using OmniLog identification system resulted in 15
samples positive for E. coli O157:H7 with overall
prevalence of 2.4% (95% confidence interval: 1.3–
3.9%). When disaggregated according to the types of
samples examined, the specimens positive for E. coli
O157:H7 were: feces (7), carcass swabs (4), meat (3)
and cutting board swab (1). There was no statistically
significant difference in the occurrence of E. coli
O157:H7 between butcher houses and abattoir (p >

the bacterium is detected only in faecal

The prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 at animal level was
4.7% (7/150) (95% CI [2.0 – 10.0]). Carcass swab of E.
coli O157: H7 statuses were considered as indicator of
contamination and were not used for the calculation of
prevalence at animal level (feces). There was no statisti-
cally significant difference (p > 0.05) in the prevalence of
E. coli O157:H7 between sex, origin and breed. However,
there was statistically significant difference (p ≤ 0.05) in
the occurrence of E. coli O157:H7 between age groups
(Table 2), in which higher prevalence was found in age
group of ≥ 7 years than younger animals.

Susceptibility of the isolates to different antimicrobials
Subjecting of the 15 isolates of E. coli O157:H7 to various
antimicrobials resulted in different susceptibility patterns.
The isolates were found to be 100% susceptible to genta-
mycin (GEN 10 μg), ceftriaxone (CTR 30 μg), nalidixic
acid (NA 30 μg) kanamycin (k 5 μg) and cefotaxime (CTX
30 μg).the result showed a decreased susceptibility pattern
of the isolates to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMC 30 μg)
(80%), tetracycline (TE 10 μg) (73.7%) and streptomycin
(S 10 μg) (50%). The details of susceptibility and resistance
pattern of all isolates of E. coli O157:H7 are described in
Fig. 1 and Table 3, respectively.

Discussion
Human infections of E. coli O157:H7 have mostly been
recognized to be originated from animal source foods
[28]. Domestic ruminants, mainly cattle, sheep, and

goats, have been established as major natural reservoirs
for STEC and play a significant role in the epidemiology
of human infections [9]. In the present study, presence
of E. coli O157:H7 on carcasses suggests transfer of fecal
material onto the carcass during the slaughter process,
which may suggest that currently available dressing pro-
cedures at the abattoir cannot be reliable to prevent fecal
contamination during slaughtering.

Observed prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 at abattoir
level (2.8%) is in line with the findings from Ethiopia [7],
South Africa [10], United Kingdom [11, 12] and Ireland
[13] which reported 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.2 and 3.0%, respect-
ively. Compared with the present study, higher preva-
lence of E. coli O157:H7 have been also reported (8%
from Ethiopia [5] and 6.4–9.6% from Iran [14–16]. Al-
though the numbers of samples positive for STEC under
some categories of the considered risk factors were small
to make statistically valid comparisons, more positive
animals were found to be male, local breed animals and
those in old age groups. The prevalence of E. coli
O157:H7 showed statistically significant difference (p ≤
0.05) among the different age groups. Observed variation
in prevalence among studies could be attributed to dif-
ference in sampling and isolation procedures, variability
in sampled populations, diverse geographical origins of
cattle, numbers of cattle, study design, season, abattoir
conditions and treatment with antimicrobial substances
during the process [17–19].

The higher occurrence of E. coli O157:H7in feces of
the slaughtered animals when compared with carcass
swabs in the present study is in line with the findings at
Manhattan abattoir (4.7%) [20] and in Great Britain
(4.7%) [21]. Studies have also showed that prevalence of
E. coli O157:H7 shed from animal feces can vary signifi-
cantly in relation to time, age of animals and nature of
feeds [18, 22].

In the present study, all of

the 15 isolates were
found to be entirely susceptible to ceftriaxone (CTR
30 μg), cefotaxime (CTX 30 μg), gentamycin (GEN
10 μg), kanamycin (K, 5 μg) and nalidixic acid
(NA30μg). This is in agreement with previous studies
from Ethiopia [5, 8]. However, a study conducted in
Saudi Arabia revealed that there was resistant strain
to nalidixic acid (NA30μg), cefotaxime (CTX 30 μg),
and gentamycin (GEN 10 μg)
[23]. This variation
probably attributed to the expression of resistant gene
code by the pathogen which is associated with emer-
ging and re-emerging aspects of
the isolates with
regards to different agro ecology [24]. On the other
hand, in the present study more than half of the iso-
lates were resistant to ampicillin (AMP 10 μg). This
might be due to inappropriate or excessive use of an-
tibiotics
therapeutic and prophylactic purpose
both for E. coli and other infections.

Fig. 1 Antimicrobial susceptibility profile of Escherichia coli O157:H7 isolated from abattoir and butcher shops in Hawassa

In our present study, we used OmniLog System which
is comparable to molecular techniques. OmniLog Sys-
tem use redox (Oxidation reduction) reaction which en-
ables testing of Gram negative and Gram positive
bacteria in the same test panel. Actually it would have
been good to use a molecular test (like 16sRNA) which
is more accurate than Omnilog but this could not be re-
alized due to resource constraints at the time of the
study.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the occurrence of E. coli O157:H7 in ap-
parently healthy slaughtered cattle with some antimicro-
bial resistance pattern suggests a potential risk to public
health. The presence of E. coli O157:H7in fecal sample
followed by carcass swab highly suggests unhygienic
practices in the abattoir and the poor hygiene is the key
source of microbial contamination of the meat. Our
study calls for developing preventive approach to control
E. coli O157:H7 contamination in meat production chain
by imposing strict hygienic meat processing practices in
Hawassa municipal abattoir. This can be done by ensur-
ing Good hygienic Practice, Good Manufacturing

Methods
Study area and population
The study was carried out in Hawassa city, located 273
km South of Addis Ababa. Geographically, the City lies
between 7°3′ latitude North and 38°28′ longitudes East.
The mean annual precipitation is 933.4 mm. Tempera-
tures vary between 5 and 34 °C. The landform is plain
with reddish volcano soil. Its population is increasing at
an alarming rate. Currently the total population pro-
jected to 329, 000 [25]. Samples were collected from
November 2014 to April 2015. In Hawassa city munici-
pality abattoir, on average 75 heads of cattle are slaugh-
tered daily for local consumption. No other animal
species were slaughtered in the abattoir during the study
period. Both sexes and various age groups of cattle were
slaughtered during the study period. The cattle slaugh-
tered at Hawassa abattoir were originated from Hawasa
itself and different nearby areas, especially Tikurwoha,
Tula, Yirgalem, Wondogenet and Arsi Negelle. At the
time of the study, the manpower of the abattoir com-
prised: six meat inspectors, three sanitary, 14 eviscera-
tors, four flayers, four carcass splitters, four cleaners,
eight transporters, three management staff, two drivers
and two guards.

Similarly, at the time of the study in Hawassa city
about 100 butcher shops were legally registered and
obtaining carcasses from the municipal abattoir. Infor-
mal observations of the butcher shops indicated gener-
ally poor hygienic status and normally they didn’t use
any disinfectant to clean the wall,
floor and cutting
board. In addition, the visceral organs were put very
near to the carcass when displayed for sale or when
meat cut
selling or consumption.

Moreover, it was observed that the cutting boards made
from wooden materials were often used.

Study design and sampling
A cross-sectional study was conducted involving sample
collection from apparently healthy slaughtered cattle, ab-
attoir environment and butcher shops. On each sam-
pling day, usually once a week, 7–10 animals were
selected by using systematic random sampling method.
Before slaughter,
information about each animal (age,
sex, breed, health status and origin) was recorded using
format prepared for this purpose. The types of samples
collected from abattoir were fecal contents of the ani-
mals, carcass swabs from slaughtered animals, swabs
from abattoir environments (eviscerator’s knife, eviscera-
tor hands, transporter clothes). From butchers shops the
collected samples included: knife swab, butcher’s hand
swab, cutting board swab and meat samples. All the
samples for the study were collected under strict aseptic
procedures and then transported in ice box to the Veter-
inary Microbiology Laboratory of the School of Veterin-
ary Medicine of Hawassa University and stored at 4 °C
until processed for the presence of E. coli O157:H7.

Previous study made in Bishoftu abattoir showed the
prevalence of E. coli O157: H7 to be 8% in cattle [5].
Therefore, by using this 8% expected prevalence, at a
confidence level of 95% and required absolute precision
of 5%, the minimum sample size was 114 [26]. However,
in order to increase the precision of the study a total of
150 animals were examined. Therefore, 150 carcass swab
and 150 fecal samples were collected from 150 slaugh-
tered cattle. Whereas carcasses in contact surface swabs
were taken once for each sampling day.

Isolation of E. coli O157:H7
Approximately 1 ml/1 g of feces (homogenized when
possible) was suspended into 9 ml of modified tryptone
soya broth. Samples were vortexed and incubated over-
night at 41 °C. After selective enrichment, fifty micro li-
ters of product was streaked onto Sorbitol MacConkey
(SMAC) agar (Oxoid) supplemented with cefixime and
the inoculated plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h.
Then, up to six colourless colonies (non- Sorbitol fer-
menters) on SMAC agar were picked and separately
sub-cultured on MacConkey agar (Oxoid) and incubated
for 24 h at 37 °C for purification.

The purified and intensely red colonies with a pale
periphery were tested for hydrogensulphide and indole
production using Triple Sugar Iron agar (TSI) slant
(Oxoid) and Indole production test. Those isolates giving
a result of yellow slant and butt with gas but no hydro-
gen sulfide (Y/Y/ H2S -) production on TSI slant agar
after incubation of the media at 37 °C for 24 h were kept
with

conditions. Indole test was carried out as follows. One
pure colony was inoculated into 4 ml of tryptone soya
broth (Oxoid) using a straight inoculation wire. Incuba-
tion was done for overnight at 37 °C. Then one drop of
Indole (Kovac’s) reagent was added to the tryptone soya
broth culture to test for indole production (formation of
red ring indicating positive reaction).

The carcass bacterial swabs were incubated over-
night at 41 °C after being suspended into modified
tryptone soya broth (Oxoid) (1:9) and were subjected
to tests for bacteriological analysis similar to the fecal
samples.

Meat samples from each butcher shop were collected
using universal bottle and 25 g of the meat was weighed,
chopped aseptically and mixed with 225 ml of buffered
peptone water; in a sterile plastic bag and homogenized
using a homogenizer (stomacher 400, Seward Medical,
England) at high speed for 2 min. The homogenate was
then incubated at 41 °C for 16 to 18 h and subjected to
similar tests for bacteriological analysis as fecal samples.
Environmental samples were incubated overnight at
41 °C after being suspended into modified tryptone soya
broth (Oxoid) (at 1:9ratios) and subjected to similar tests
for bacteriological analysis as fecal samples.

Identification of E. coli O157:H7
Identification and confirmation of E. coli O157:H7was
done at the Ethiopian Biodiversity Institute of (EBI),
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Biochemically positive sample for
E.coliwere seeded onto nutrient agar and transported to
the microbiology laboratory of EBI, using icebox. Upon
arrival, the isolates were stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C.
After preparing the rainbow agar O157 (Hayward, USA),
the isolated colony from nutrient broth was inoculated
by spreading suspected colonies of E.coli O157:H7on its
surface. The plates were then incubated for 20 to 24 h,
or longer, at 37 °C and observed for the presence of typ-
ical black or gray coloration on Rainbow agar O157
which shows pure colonies. The pure colonies were in-
oculated on BUG (Biolog Universal Growth Medium)
agar (Hayward, USA) with 5% sheep blood and incu-
bated at 37 °C for 24 h. Subculture was made using the
same culture media to have pure culture colonies before
identification was done by OmniLog as follows. First,
bacterial suspension was prepared with an appropriate
level of bacterial density, as recommended in the proto-
col of the instrument. Then the bacterial suspension was
inoculated into the GEN III Micro Plates aseptically.
The MicroPlates were covered with lid and incubated at
37 °C for 22 h. Then the Micro Plates were loaded into
the OmniLog incubator/reader. The bacterial suspension
was identified by the instrument using the inbuilt
database.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
The antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed fol-
lowing the standard agar disk diffusion method using
commercial antimicrobial disks [27]. The selection cri-
teria of the antibiotics depended on the regular use of
the antimicrobials in the ruminants, potential public
health importance and recommended from the guideline
of antimicrobial susceptibility testing [27]. A standard
reference strain of E. coli (ATCC 25922), sensitive to all
antimicrobial drugs being tested, was used as a control.
