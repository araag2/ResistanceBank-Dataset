number CU459141) and in the draft genomes of WM98, 3208 and
D2 differed from one another by fewer than ﬁve single nucleotide
differences, but only the WM98 sequence was not interrupted by
large insertions or deletions (positions of insertions/deletions are
indicated in Figure 1). AB307-0294 (GenBank accession number
CP001172) was also identical over most of this span, but con-
tained patches that differed and lacked a large span. The
AB0057 sequence (GenBank accession number CP001182), for
which the ampC gene was previously corrected, differed at 33
more positions (single base substitutions or additions or deletions;
mainly the absence of an A or a T in a run of As or Ts) and many of
these differences may be errors caused by the sequencing tech-
nology used.

Contigs containing ampC and its surrounds were retrieved from
the whole genome sequence of G7 reported previously6 and
joined using the manually determined sequence described
above. Comparison with the WM98 sequence revealed a segment
of 31.8 kb, deﬁned as between the ﬁrst and last base differences
surrounding the ISAba1-ampC in G7, which differed from the cor-
responding region in WM98 by 2.2% (Figure 1). This indicates that
this segment has been replaced by a segment imported from
another A. baumannii strain that included an ISAba1 upstream
of the ampC gene. Hence, it appears that a DNA segment that
included an ISAba1-activated ampC gene was introduced into
an isolate belonging to the GC1 clonal complex, possibly by con-
jugation, and that homologous recombination incorporated it into
the chromosome displacing the resident copy. Examination of the
regions on either side of the 31.8 kb diverged segment revealed
the presence of two smaller replaced patches of 4.7 and 2.8 kb
in G7, which differed from the corresponding regions in WM98
by 4.5% and 2.1%, respectively (Figure 1). Outside these patches,
WM98 and G7 differed by only 3 bp.

This is the ﬁrst study providing evidence for horizontal transfer
of a DNA segment that contains an ISAba1-activated ampC gene
between two A. baumannii strains. The ﬁndings highlight the
signiﬁcance of the horizontal transfer of chromosomal DNA
segments in the generation of cephalosporin resistance in
A. baumannii.

Sir,
The epidemiology of extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs)
has changed worldwide over recent years and nowadays ESBLs
of the CTX-M-8 group are being increasingly detected in
Escherichia coli from humans, animals and food.1 – 10 In this
regard, a recent report published in JAC suggested the possibility
of transmission of CTX-M-8-positive strains by travellers or con-
taminated food.1 In this study, we report for the ﬁrst time the iso-
lation of CTX-M-8-producing E. coli in dairy buffalo, highlighting a
new reservoir of ESBL producers.

From March 2010 to June 2011, during a local surveillance study
established to monitor
the occurrence of broad-spectrum
cephalosporin- and/or ﬂuoroquinolone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae
in food-producing animals, 18 enroﬂoxacin-resistant E. coli isolates

were recovered from faecal swab samples collected from 46 buffalo
calves (up to 6 months of age) raised semi-extensively for milk pro-
duction on six dairy farms in the states of Sa˜o Paulo and Parana´,
south-eastern Brazil. Non-repetitive faecal sampling included 13
samples from Farm 1, 7 from Farm 2, 6 from Farm 3, 2 from Farm
4, 6 from Farm 5 and 12 from Farm 6.

The isolates were identiﬁed by conventional techniques (i.e.
Vitek 2, API and biochemical tests) and the antimicrobial suscepti-
bility was evaluated by disc diffusion assay.11,12 MIC determinations
were performed by the agar dilution or Etest methods, according
to CLSI standards,11,12 and ESBL production was investigated by
using a double-disc synergy test, Etest ESBL strips (bioMerie´ux,
Marcy-l’E´toile, France) and CHROMagarTM ESBL (Paris, France).
The presence of ESBL- and plasmid-mediated AmpC (pAmpC)
b-lactamase genes was conﬁrmed by PCR and sequencing. Further
screening of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes
was performed by PCR and chromosomal mutations in the quin-
olone resistance-determining region of the gyrA gene were investi-
gated by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Next,
phylogenetic grouping and virulence genotypes were screened by
PCR and the clonal relatedness was investigated by enterobacterial
repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR and multilocus sequence
typing (MLST) (http://mlst.warwick.ac.uk/mlst/dbs/Ecoli).

Forty-ﬁve buffalo had faecal cultures positive for E. coli, of which
18 (40%) were resistant to ﬂuoroquinolones (Table 1). Among
ﬂuoroquinolone-resistant strains, 22% (n¼ 4) exhibited further
resistance to human and veterinary broad-spectrum cephalospor-
ins (i.e. ceftiofur and cefotaxime). In this regard, three E. coli strains
showed a positive ESBL phenotype, being susceptible to cefoxitin,
whereas the fourth E. coli strain displayed resistance to cefoxitin,
being suspected of harbouring a pAmpC enzyme. In fact, the pres-
ence of the blaCTX-M-8 and blaCMY-2 genes was conﬁrmed by PCR and
sequencing in cefoxitin-susceptible and cefoxitin-resistant E. coli
strains, respectively. On the other hand, all ﬂuoroquinolone-
resistant strains had an identical mutation in GyrA (Ser83Phe)
and nine of them carried qnr-like PMQR genes (Table 1).
Genotyping by ERIC-PCR showed eight different genetic proﬁles
(named A–H) among ﬂuoroquinolone-resistant strains and phylo-
genetic investigation showed that the low-virulence phylogenetic
group B1 (89%) was predominant (Table 1). Only two E. coli strains
belonged to the high-virulence phylogenetic group B2, which were
positive for stx2 andeae genes, characterizing them as Shiga toxin-
producing E. coli. Finally, while CTX-M-8-producing E. coli strains
belonged to sequence types ST224, ST2179 and ST2308, the
CMY-2-producing E. coli belonged to ST205.

In this study, we report the occurrence of ﬂuoroquinolone-
resistant and ESBL-producing E. coli in commercial dairy buffalo.
Fluoroquinolone resistance was linked to a high MIC of ciproﬂoxa-
cin (MIC50¼16 mg/L) and enroﬂoxacin (MIC50¼32 mg/L) and the
predominant genetic basis for this resistance was mutations in
gyrA, whereas resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins was
associated with CTX-M-8 and CMY-2 enzymes and as such is a
cause of clinical concern.

In Brazil, buffalo are generally raised without a national buffalo
breeding improvement programme and thus there is no available
report concerning the use of antimicrobial drugs. However, in this
study, all farms reported previous use of enroﬂoxacin for the
empirical treatment of infectious diarrhoea in dairy calves.

The correlation of antimicrobial resistance in E. coli isolates
with the low-virulence phylogenetic group B1 suggests that

selection of silent carriers of acquired resistance genes, among
commensal E. coli, in buffalo is ongoing. In this regard, it has
been proposed that commensal microﬂora could represent a
long-term reservoir of resistance genes that could be transferred
horizontally to other bacteria. In fact, the blaCTX-M-8 gene was
described for the ﬁrst time in 2000, in cefotaxime-resistant
Enterobacteriaceae isolated in Brazil.2 Since then, it is has been
widely identiﬁed in E. coli isolates from South America (Uruguay,
Argentina and French Guiana),1,7,8 North America (the USA and
Canada),1,3 Africa (Kenya and Tunisia),10 Asia (Japan)9 and
Europe (Spain, the UK and Germany).1,4,5 Of particular interest
has been the description of CTX-M-8-producing E. coli in chicken
meat in the UK,5 Sweden,6 Japan9 and Tunisia, mostly in imported
meat from South America, which suggests the possibility of trans-
mission of CTX-M-8-positive strains by contaminated food, high-
lighting the potential for CTX-M-8 to become endemic worldwide.
Additional studies should be performed in the future to track
changes in the epidemiology and evolution of ESBLs and their fre-
quencies in different ecosystems and animal hosts. Moreover, man-
agement practices focusing on eliminating resistance development
in food-producing animals could reduce the burden of antibiotic
resistance on farms. In summary, we showed that dairy buffalo
can represent a new reservoir of genes conferring resistance to crit-
ically important antibiotics used in human and veterinary medicine.

Keywords: L. pneumophila, Legionnaires’ disease, susceptibility

Sir,
Legionella species are responsible for 1% – 5% of cases of
community-acquired pneumonia. Legionella pneumophila sero-
group 1 (SG1) accounts for .90% of Legionnaires’ disease (LD)
in North America and Europe1 and is the cause of signiﬁcant mor-
tality. The mortality rate among patients with L. pneumophila
infections continues to be high, up to 26%.2 The antimicrobial
agents most commonly used for treatment of LD are ﬂuoroquino-
lones (e.g. ciproﬂoxacin or levoﬂoxacin) and macrolides.3 In recent

studies, we established wild-type distributions and determined
the epidemiological cut-off values (ECOFFs) in clinical L. pneumo-
phila SG1 isolates for 10 antimicrobials commonly used for the
treatment of Legionella infections.4

A patient sought care at his general practitioner after several
days of falling and body pains. On examination, the patient
appeared ill and was sent to the emergency department of a
nearby hospital. The initial chest radiograph demonstrated
an inﬁltrate of the left lower lung ﬁeld. The patient was admitted
to the intensive care unit. Blood cultures were taken and antibiotic
treatment was started with cefazolin and gentamicin. Urine was
examined for the presence of Legionella antigens and when this
test was reported positive, treatment was switched to 400 mg
of ciproﬂoxacin intravenously twice daily. After initial improve-
ment the clinical condition of the patient deteriorated, leading
to intubation and mechanical ventilation. A new chest radiograph
revealed a diffuse interstitial pneumonia. Bronchoalveolar lavage
(BAL) was performed 4 days after treatment with ciproﬂoxacin
was started and the patient slowly recovered. Eventually, culture
of the BAL grew L. pneumophila SG1 after 4 days of ciproﬂoxacin
treatment. After 10 days, the patient could be transferred to
the ward. Therapy was then switched to 500 mg of clarithro-
mycin orally twice daily. The patient’s further recovery was
uncomplicated.

The L. pneumophila SG1 strain was sent, as part of a national
Legionella outbreak detection programme, to the reference
laboratory for Legionella in Haarlem, The Netherlands.5 Sus-
ceptibility testing for ciproﬂoxacin was performed with Etest and
an MIC value of ciproﬂoxacin of 2 mg/L was found. This value is
outside the wild-type distribution range ECOFF¼1 mg/L as previ-
ously described and therefore potentially resistant.4

For sequencing of gyrA and gyrB (DNA gyrase) and parC and
parE (topoisomerase IV) genes, extraction of L. pneumophila
DNA was performed. The DNA extraction was performed by use
of Qiagen’s BioRobotw EZ1 (Hilden, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The sequencing reaction was per-
formed twice by using primer systems previously described for
the L. pneumophila SG1 strain Paris.6 A comparative analysis of
the obtained sequences was done using the published L. pneu-
mophila genomes and data from the literature describing muta-
tions in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of
type II topoisomerase of L. pneumophila by using DNAStar
(WI, USA) software and the NCBI database.6,7 For control ex-
periments, the wild-type strain MTZ OLDA and a spontaneous
quinolone-resistant mutant of this strain were used. MTZ OLDA
is an environmental isolate (L. pneumophila SG1), isolated from
the water supply of a large building.8 A point mutation in the
QRDR of the gyrA gene was identiﬁed and this mutation led to
an amino acid exchange at position 83 (Escherichia coli number-
ing system). The result of this amino acid exchange is a change
in ciproﬂoxacin susceptibility. Mutation at the same position
(amino acid 83) has also been reported for other spontaneous
quinolone-resistant mutants (Table 1).

It is known that, in general, pathogens can become resistant
during the course of a patient’s therapy and also induction of
resistance upon exposure to antibiotics has been described.6,7
The origin of resistance in the clinical isolate is as yet unclear.
There are two possibilities. The ﬁrst is that the patient contracted
an L. pneumophila SG1 strain with this point mutation from the
environment. Alternatively, the mutation occurred during the
