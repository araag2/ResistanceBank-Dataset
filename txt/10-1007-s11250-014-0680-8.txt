Abstract Salmonella spp. infections are considered as the
most common food-borne disease globally. The contamina-
tion of food products with Salmonella has given rise to severe
health and economic challenges. This study assessed the
prevalence of Salmonella in the faeces of cows and goats in
the Eastern Cape province of South Africa, their antibiotic
resistance patterns as well as antibiotic-resistant gene deter-
minant. Antibiotic disc was used for antibiogram profiles
while polymerase chain reaction was employed for the detec-
tion of antibiotic-resistant genes. A total of 150 Salmonella
were isolated from the faecal samples. Eighty two (55 %)
isolates were recovered from cow faeces while 68 (45 %)
were isolated from goat faeces. All Salmonella isolates were
sensitive to ciprofloxacin (100 %) while 95 % were sensitive
to ofloxacin. Also, a high sensitivity of 93 and 89 % was
observed against nalidixic acid and ofloxacin, respectively.
Salmonella isolates demonstrated moderate sensitivity against
cephalothin (70 %), chloramphenicol (75 %) and minocycline
(68 %) while 49 % were resistant to tetracycline and erythro-
mycin. The prevalence of the antibiotic-resistant genes in
Salmonella isolates were detected as follows: integron con-
served segment 28 % (42/150), blaTEM gene 19.3 % (29/150),
blapse1 7.3 % (11/150) and blaampC 4.7 % (7/150). The results
obtained in the study imply that cow and goat faeces could be
potential reservoirs of Salmonella and could possibly cause
infections as a result of contamination of food products. There
is a need for a surveillance system to track resistance patterns
of Salmonella circulating in South Africa.

Introduction

Salmonella is a well-known zoonotic pathogen causing diar-
rhoea, pyrexia and septicaemia in animals and humans. A
wide range of clinical signs of Salmonella infections include
acute septicaemia, abortion, arthritis and respiratory disease
(Abouzeed et al. 2000; Akoachere et al. 2009). Salmonella
could also be found present in animal feedstuffs, leading to
subclinical gastrointestinal carriage or infectious disease in
animals. A characteristic feature of this bacterium is its wide
host range, which comprises most animal species including
mammals, birds and cold-blooded animals (Wilfred et al.
2000; Curtello et al. 2013). Generally, animals may be
infected without signs of clinical illness. As such, animals
could be vital in respect to the spread of infection between
flocks and herds and as sources of food contamination and
human infection (Abouzeed et al. 2000). In most cases,
salmonellosis is caused by contaminated food products,
particularly those of animal origin such as poultry, eggs,
beef and pork (Bouchrif et al. 2009).

Salmonella infections (salmonellosis) are considered as the
most common food-borne disease and have been recognized
globally in both developed and developing countries, resulting
to high morbidity and economic costs (Antoine et al. 2008;
Ammari et al. 2009). The contamination of food products with
Salmonella has given rise to severe health and economic
challenges, which have enthused various studies designed
to investigate the transmission routes of these organisms in
different farm animals and the environment (Winfield and
Groisman 2003; Ammari et al. 2009).

Antibiotics are used in food-producing animals for prophy-
laxis, to treat diseases or to aid in the growth and development

38

of farm animals. However, animals could be a source of food-
borne-resistant bacteria. Several studies carried out have doc-
umented the direct transfer of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from
animals to humans (Zare et al. 2014). Antimicrobial-resistant
Salmonella in food animals could acquire their resistance in
animals, which might lead to human infections with food-
borne-resistant bacteria through the food chain (Carattoli
2003; Stevens et al. 2006; Glenn et al. 2011). Also, they could
perpetuate the spread of antibiotic-resistant genes to human
by horizontal gene transfer through such mobile genetic
elements as plasmids and integrons (Igbinosa et al. 2013).
Class 1 integrons are one of the single biggest contributors
to multidrug-resistant microbial infections, carrying resis-
tance to many antibiotics in different pathogens globally
(Stokes et al. 2006).

The digestive tract of humans and animals persists as the
major reservoir of the contamination of food, and animals play
a role in the distribution of salmonellosis (Nisbet and Ziprin
2001; Bouchrif et al. 2009). In meat production, the leading
source of contamination of carcasses by Salmonella is the
evisceration process; faecal bacteria may accidentally contam-
inate the meat and meat products (Stevens et al. 2006;
Vandendriessche 2008; Bouchrif et al. 2009; Zare et al.
2014). Although non-typhoidal salmonellosis in humans is
usually a self-limiting disease, when symptoms persist, or
when immunocompromised persons are affected, it may have
serious consequences requiring appropriate antimicrobial
treatment. However, in animals, such symptoms may be dead-
ly; thus, treatment with appropriate antimicrobial agents be-
comes vital. Therefore, the surveillance of antimicrobial resis-
tance is necessary for successful treatment. The public health
measures to lessen the burden of infection, thus, take into
consideration the presence of the organism in animals
(Woldemariam et al. 2005; Akoachere et al. 2009). This study
was carried out to assess the antibiogram profiling and
antibiotic-resistant gene determinant of Salmonella in the
faeces of cows and goats in the Eastern Cape province of
South Africa.

Materials and methods

Sample collection

The animal faecal samples were obtained from an animal farm
in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa between
February and August 2010. Faecal samples were collected at
random using a sterile spatula into a sterile sample bottle. The
samples were maintained in cold chain immediately after
collection, and then transported to the laboratory for analysis.
Samples collected were from beef cows and meat goats. The
animal farm is a large commercial farm comprising of differ-
ent farm animals including about 50 cows and 70 goats.

Microbiological analysis

Ten grams of animal faecal sample was inoculated into 10 ml
of buffered peptone water as a pre-enrichment step and incu-
bated at 37 °C for 18 h. Aliquots from pre-enrichment were
inoculated into 10 ml of Rappaport-Vassiliadis Soya broth,
selective enrichment media, and incubated at 42 °C for 18 h
(Ammari et al. 2009). A loopful of the broth culture was
streaked on plates of Hektoen selective media and Salmonella-
Shigella agar. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h.
Suspected colonies of Salmonella from each plate were purified
(non-lactose fermenting with suitable colony morphology) and
collected for presumptive identification. All strains were stored
frozen at −80 °C in 20 % glycerol.

Biochemical identification

Pure presumptive colonies of Salmonella were subcultured on
a nutrient agar plate and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h; after-
wards, catalase and oxidase tests were carried out. Oxidase-
negative, catalase-positive isolates were further suspended in
normal physiological saline and turbidity adjusted to 0.5
McFarland standard. The bacteria suspension was inoculated
onto API 20E strips (bioMérieux, Marcy-L’Étoile, France)
following manufacturer’s instructions. After 24 h incubation
at 37 °C, strips were read according to manufacturer’s manual
and the results were secured using API 20E software (Shah
and Korejo 2012).

Antibiogram profiling of isolates

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using disc
diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar. Antibiotics were
selected based on drugs commonly used in the treatment of
diarhoea and those used in veterinary medicine. Antibiotics
used in the study includes the following: penicillins (PEN;
10 μg), cefotaxime (CEF; 30 μg), nalidixic acid (NAL;
30 μg), cephalothin (CEP; 30 μg), ciprofloxacin (CIP;
5 μg), gentamicin (GEN; 10 μg), chloramphenicol (CHL;
30 μg), tetracycline (TET; 10 μg), erythromycin (ERY;
15 μg), minocycline (MIN; 30 μg), vancomycin (VAN;
30 μg), oxacillin (OXA; 1 μg), ofloxacin (OFL; 5 μg), ampi-
cillin (AMP; 25 μg), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TXM;
25 μg), aztreonam (AZT; 30 μg) and streptomycin (STR;
10 μg). Discs were purchased from Mast Diagnostics (Mast
Group, Merseyside, UK). Isolates were identified as suscepti-
ble, intermediate or resistant according to the guidelines of the
clinical and laboratory standard institute (CLSI 2006).

Antibiotic-resistant gene determination

The genomic DNA of Salmonella isolates was extracted fol-
lowing the methods of Sambrook and Russell (2001) and

Igbinosa et al. (2013). The set of primers used for the detection
of antibiotic-resistant genes is shown in Table 1. The PCR
reaction was carried out in a total volume of 25 μl and the
following conditions: integron conserved segment (initial de-
naturation at 94 °C for 12 min, 1 min of denaturation at 94 °C,
1 min of annealing at 55 °C and 5 min of extension at 72 °C
for a total of 35 cycles; 5 s was added to the extension time at
each cycle); blaTEM gene (3 min at 93 °C, 40 cycles of 1 min at
93 °C, 1 min at 55 °C and 1 min at 72 °C and finally 7 min at
72 °C); blaampC gene (94 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles of 25 s of
denaturation at 94 °C, 40 s of annealing at 53 °C and 50 s of
extension at 72 °C and a final cycle at 7 min at 72 °C); Tet C
gene (3 min at 94 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C,
1 min at 65 °C and 1 min at 72 °C followed by 10 min at
72 °C); blapse1 (initial denaturation at 96 °C for 5 min, then 30
cycles of denaturation at 96 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C and
a single extension of 5 min at 72 °C). The amplified products
were electrophoresed in 0.8 % agarose gels (Hispanagar,
Spain) containing ethidium bromide 0.5 mg/l (Merck, South
Africa) for 1 h at 100 V in 0.5×TAE buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl,
20 mM Na acetate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.5), visualized and
photographed with an imaging system Alliance 4.7 XD-79
(UVITEC Cambridge) (Igbinosa et al. 2013).

Results

A total of 150 Salmonella were isolated from the faecal
samples collected. The isolates were identified based on bio-
chemical characteristics; however, further strain characteriza-
tion was not carried out. Eighty two (54.7 %) isolates were
recovered from cow faeces while 68 (45.3 %) were isolated
from goat faeces. Antibiotic susceptibility carried out showed
that these isolates were multidrug resistant (Table 2). Of the
150 isolates, 125 (83.3 %) were resistant to penicillin, 84
(56 %) were resistant to ampicillin while 74 (49.3 %) were
resistant to erythromycin. In addition, none of the isolates
were resistant to ciprofloxacin whereas absolute resistance

was observed against oxacillin and vancomycin (Table 2). In
general, isolates showed appreciable susceptibility (≥85 %)
against ofloxacin and nalidixic acid.

Some of the Salmonella isolates were found to possess the
antibiotic-resistant determinant screened. The prevalence of
the antibiotic-resistant genes detected were as follows:
integron conserved segment 42 (28 %), blaTEM gene 29
(19.3 %), blapse1 11 (7.3 %), blaampC 7 (4.7 %) while Tet C
was not detected in the Salmonella isolates. Figure 1 shows
gel electrophoresis of PCR products of the integron gene of
selected Salmonella isolates.

Discussion

Salmonella is a well-known zoonotic pathogen in animals and
humans. Animals could possibly spread these organisms in
the environment (Abouzeed et al. 2000; Akoachere et al.
2009). The occurrence of Salmonella in the faeces of cattle
and goats have been documented (Zare et al. 2014), potenti-
ating the fact that food-producing animals are carrier of faecal
shedding of Salmonella. Gragg et al. (2013) reported the
prevalence of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica sero-
types in cattle faeces among other sources in Mexico. Glenn
et al. (2011) reported the presence of Salmonella from food-
producing animals including cattle. Also, the occurrence of
Salmonella at variable frequency from different samples ob-
tained from goats (including faecal samples) in Ethiopia has
been documented (Woldemariam et al. 2005). The recovery of
Salmonella from cow faeces may not be surprising, as cattle
have been regarded as an important reservoir for Salmonella
(Gragg et al. 2013).

The recovery rate of Salmonella in the study was high.
Some studies have reported the low prevalence of Salmonella
in goat population (Mahmood et al. 2014). Similarly, a low
prevalence rate was reported by D’Amico et al. (2008) who
surveyed 133 milk samples, but Salmonella could not be
recovered even from a single sample of goat, sheep and cow’s
milk. Also, Radostits et al. (2007) reported the prevalence of

Salmonella in other species but none was detected in goats.
However,
the source of high prevalence of Salmonella
observed in these animals in the study could be via inges-
tion of contaminated feed (Kidd et al. 2002) or grazing
plants that may have been contaminated with untreated effluents
or sludge through fertilization (Akoachere et al. 2009). Another
speculation could be the hygiene status of the farm and farm
animals, as this could be a predisposing factor of high preva-
lence of Salmonella in the faeces of farm animals.

Salmonella isolates obtained in the study were highly mul-
tidrug resistant. The isolates from cow and goat faeces were
found to demonstrate variable resistance patterns. Isolates
from cow faeces were highly sensitive to gentamicin while

isolates from goat faeces were moderately sensitive. Another
observation was that isolates from goat were less sensitive to
some antibiotics including cephalothin, cefotaxime and chlor-
amphenicol among others (Table 2). It can therefore be de-
duced that isolates from cow faeces were more susceptible to
cephalosporin compared to isolates from goat faeces. On the
other hand, isolates from goat faeces were more sensitive to
the tetracycline (tetracycline and minocycline). In general,
most of the isolates were highly sensitive to quinolones
(ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid and ofloxacin), indicating that
quinolones are mainly the active antibiotics against
the
Salmonella isolates. Salmonella sensitivity to the quino-
lones has been reported from Cameroun (Akoachere et al.
2009), Iran (Dallal et al. 2010), India (Bhatia et al. 2007)
and Austria (Mayrhofer et al. 2004), suggesting a wide
distribution of Salmonella isolates sensitive to the quino-
lones. β-Lactamases confer resistance to the penicillin
group of antibiotics, first to fourth generation cephalospo-
rins and monobactams (Wu et al. 2011). This may be a
reason for the resistance observed against isolates to penicillin
and oxacillin and the moderate sensitivity observed with
Salmonella isolates against cephalothin and cefotaxime.

Salmonella isolates obtained in the study were found to
express the beta lactamase genes examined. The onset of
resistance of non-typhoidal Salmonella to extended-
spectrum cephalosporin antibiotics is noteworthy in public
health (Kruger et al. 2004). Studies have shown the occur-
rence of a wide range of beta lactamase genes in Salmonella
(Baraniak et al. 2002; Casin et al. 2003; Kruger et al. 2004;
Sjolund-Karlsson et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2014); however, these
were basically clinical isolates. On the other hand, a broad
distribution of blaTEM gene in Salmonella isolated from

Trop Anim Health Prod (2015) 47:37–43

animal samples has been documented, for instance, blaTEM
gene was detected in Salmonella isolated from cattle faeces in
Egypt (Dahshan et al. 2010) and in food-producing animal in
the USA (Glenn et al. 2011), blaTEM gene was found in
Salmonella recovered from cow and goat faeces in a study.
Although this is the first report of the occurrence of blaTEM
gene in Salmonella recovered from animal faeces in the
Eastern Cape province of South Africa, nonetheless, the prev-
alence of blaTEM gene in Salmonella from clinical samples in
South Africa including Eastern Cape province has been doc-
umented (Kruger et al. 2004). A relatively higher number of
Salmonella isolates in the study were found to harbour blaTEM
gene compared to clinical isolates reported (Kruger et al.
2004), but lower than Salmonella isolates from human and
food sources in Bulgaria (Archambault et al. 2006). blaampC
gene was detected in low prevalence in Salmonella isolates in
the study, and the occurrence of blaampC in Salmonella iso-
lates from human and animal sources has been documented in
the USA (Winokur et al. 2000), Romania (Miriagou et al.
2002), Taiwan (Yan et al. 2003) and in clinical isolates in
South Africa (Kruger et al. 2004) and South Korea (Lee et al.
2014).

Salmonella isolates in the study were found to harbour
blapse1 gene, this result is consistent with the findings of
Dahshan et al. (2010), as S. enterica serovars Stanley isolated
from cattle faeces was found to possess blapse1 gene. Also,
Salmonella isolates from food animal sources were found to
possess blapse1 gene (Glenn et al. 2011). It is interesting to find
out that all isolates that possessed blapse1 also had either
blaTEM, blaampC or both genes simultaneously. A similar
observation of the direct association of blapse1 and blaTEM
genes in Salmonella isolates has been documented (Dahshan
et al. 2010). The reason for this strong relationship is not clear,
but it reveals that Salmonella could possess beta lactamase
genes of several types, thereby conferring resistance to β-
lactamase antibiotics. A wide distribution of pse1 gene in
South African aquatic ecosystem has been speculated
(Igbinosa and Okoh 2012). Hence, source water may be a
possible source of these antibiotic-resistant determinants in
the animals. Therefore, good hygiene status and safe drinking
water are agitated in animal farms.

Tet C gene was not detected despite tetracycline resistance
observed in the Salmonella isolates. This was quite intriguing
despite tetracycline resistance exhibited by some isolates;
however, since Tet C is not the only tetracycline-resistant gene
that confers resistance to tetracyclines, there is a possibility
that other tetracycline-resistant determinant may be present in
the isolates. This fact is potentiated as other tetracycline-
resistant determinant has been detected in Salmonella isolates
elsewhere. For instance, Glenn et al. (2011) reported the
prevalence of tetracycline-resistant genes in Salmonella iso-
lates from food animals in Georgia. The capability of a mi-
croorganism to develop multiple drug resistances partly

results in their ability to acquire new antibiotic-resistant genes.
Mobile genetic elements called integrons determine a site-
specific recombination system that is responsible for the ac-
quisition of many antibiotic-resistant determinants (Hall and
Collis 1995; Igbinosa et al. 2013). Integron conserved seg-
ment of class 1 integron was found in some Salmonella
isolates. The presence of class 1 integron in Salmonella iso-
lates from animal sources has been documented (Dahshan
et al. 2010; Glenn et al. 2011). The detection of integron in
some Salmonella isolates indicates that these animals are
potential reservoir of antibiotic-resistant genes and are capable
of transferring antibiotic-resistant determinant to other com-
petent bacteria.

The results obtained in the study imply that cow and goat
faeces could be potential reservoirs of Salmonella and could
possibly cause infections as a result of contamination of food
products. There is a need for surveillance system to track
resistance patterns of Salmonella circulating in South Africa.
