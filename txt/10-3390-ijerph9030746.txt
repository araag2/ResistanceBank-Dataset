Abstract:  Little  information  is  available  on  relationships  between  the  biophysical 
environment  and  antibiotic  resistance.  This  study  was  conducted  to  investigate  the 
antibiotic  resistance  pattern  of  Escherichia  coli  isolated  from  child  stool  samples,  
cow-dung  and  drinking  water  from  the  non-coastal  (230  households)  and  coastal  (187 
households) regions of Odisha, India. Susceptibility testing of E. coli isolates (n = 696) to 
the  following  antibiotics:  tetracycline,  ampicillin/sulbactam,  cefuroxime,  cefotaxime, 
cefixime,  cotrimoxazole,  amikacin,  ciprofloxacin,  norfloxacin  and  nalidixic  acid  was 
performed by the disk diffusion method. Ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentration 
(MIC) values were determined for ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates (n = 83). Resistance to at 
least one antibiotic was detected in 90% or more of the E. coli isolates. Ciprofloxacin MIC 
values ranged  from 8 to 32 µg/mL. The odds ratio (OR) of resistance  in  E. coli isolates

from  children’s  stool  (OR  =  3.1,  95%  CI  1.18–8.01),  cow-dung  (OR  =  3.6,  95%  CI  
1.59–8.03, P = 0.002) and drinking water (OR = 3.8, 95% CI 1.00–14.44, P = 0.049) were 
higher in non-coastal compared to coastal region. Similarly, the co-resistance in cow-dung 
(OR  =  2.5,  95%  CI  1.39–4.37,  P  =  0.002)  and  drinking  water  (OR  =  3.2,  95%  CI  
1.36–7.41,  P  =  0.008)  as  well  as  the  multi-resistance  in  cow-dung  (OR  =  2.2,  95%  CI  
1.12–4.34, P = 0.022) and drinking water (OR = 2.7, 95% CI 1.06–7.07, P = 0.036) were 
also higher in the non-coastal compared to the coastal region.

1. Introduction  

The association of environmental factors with antibiotic resistance is an emerging issue [1,2]. The 
components of the environment are natural, physical as well as social and behavioural [3] and they all 
play an important role in modifying community health and effectiveness of medicines. A number  of 
studies document the effect of social and behavioural factors on antibiotic resistance [4], while little 
information is available on relationships between the biophysical environment and antibiotic resistance.  
Escherichia coli is present in the intestinal tracts of both humans and animals, is released into the 
environment through faecal material and is therefore used as an indicator of faecal contamination [5]. 
E. coli is also a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes [6]. In the natural environment the resistant 
bacteria and resistance genes from animal or environmental origin might transfer to humans [7,8]. Use 
of antibiotics is one of the factors contributing to resistance [4,9]. Among the antibiotics commonly 
used  both  in  human  and  veterinary  medicine  are  the  fluoroquinolones  [10],  with  ciprofloxacin  
being  the  most  consumed  fluoroquinolone  worldwide  [9].  As  a  consequence  of  this,  bacterial 
fluoroquinolone resistance has been reported both in both humans and animals [11].  

In the state of Odisha, endowed with multiple environmental niches, the infectious disease burden is 
high  in  comparison  to  other  Indian  states  [12],  however,  there  is  a  lack  of  healthcare  facilities. 
Furthermore, there is a lack of studies on antibiotic resistance. Globally, there is also a lack of studies 
on  prevalence  of  antibiotic  resistance  in  relation  to  different  geographical  regions.  Therefore,  we 
decided  to  investigate  the  antibiotic  resistance  patterns  in  E.  coli  isolates  from  two  contrasting 
biophysical environments—the coastal and non-coastal regions of Odisha. Children’s stools, cow-dung 
and  drinking  water  samples  were  included  in  this  study  as  representatives  of  both  community  and 
environmental sources.  

2. Experimental Section  

2.1. Study Settings 

This cross sectional study was conducted in two districts—“Malkangiri” (non-coastal) and “Puri” 
(coastal) of the state of Odisha (total population of 41.9 million) in India. The distinctive features of 
these two districts are given in Table 1 [13,14].

The sample size was calculated by considering the differences in proportions of antibiotic resistance 
between  the two  geographical  regions  (non-coastal  and  coastal)  for  each type  of  sample  (children’s 
stools, cow-dung and drinking water), attempting to test the null hypothesis of no difference between 
proportions,  with  a  conservative  estimated  proportion  of  antibiotic  resistance  equal  to  50%  in  each 
comparison  group;  alpha  level  =  0.05,  power  =  0.80  and  minimum  difference  in  proportions 
considered significant equal to 20%. The required sample size obtained by this calculation was at least 
103 isolates from each comparison group.  

Criteria  for  the  selection  of  the  actual  sampling  site  were  distance  from  the  seacoast,  vehicular 
accessibility and  feasibility of transportation of  samples to the  microbiology  laboratory. The census 
block (administrative area) of “Kalimela”, located at a distance of about 200 km from the sea coast, in 
the hilly district of “Malkangiri”, satisfied these criteria and was taken as a sampling site representing 
the non-coastal region. According to Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) ten kilometers of 
the landside of coastal structures is considered as a coastal area [15]. The census block of “Brahmgiri” 
in the district of “Puri”, offered an opportunity of sampling in an area closer to the sea coast (less than  
6  km  from  seacoast)  was  selected  as  a  sampling  site  representing  the  coastal  area.  Villages  were 
selected randomly from each census block. Within each village, all households having at least one cow 
and at least one child of three to nine years of age in good state of health (as reported by the head of 
the family) were selected for sampling. Children and cows are both commonly present in both areas. 
Children’s stool and cow-dung samples were thus chosen as they reflect the respective communities. In 
each selected household samples collected were from: child stool (from one child three to nine years  
of  age),  cow-dung  (from  one  cow)  and  drinking  water  (500  mL  from  the  drinking  water  storage 
container). The samples were collected in sterile containers in a single sampling time in the morning. 
The  collection  of  samples  from  a  village  was  continued  until  samples  were  collected  from  all  the 
eligible households. When no more suitable households were left in a village, sampling was continued 
in  the  next  geographically  contiguous  village.  The  process  of  sampling  was  continued  until  the 
required sample size was achieved in the coastal and non-coastal areas respectively. All samples were 
transported in an icebox (temperature less than 10 °C), to the microbiology laboratory for analysis.

During the sample collection process, along with the samples, information on the age and sex of the 
child, antibiotic treatment history of both the child and the cow, socioeconomic status of the family [16], 
source of drinking water, and defecation practices of household’s members was collected.  

Before  sample  collection,  the  procedures  and  purpose  of  the  study  were  explained  in  the  local 
language to the heads of the households and to the children. Informed consent was obtained from the 
heads of the households. The ethical committee of the Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences, Odisha, 
approved  the  study.  The  samples  were  collected  from  April  2010  to  May  2011.  A  pilot  study  was 
conducted before the main study to assess the feasibility.  

2.3. Isolation and Identification of E. coli 

The  bacterial  culture  and  isolation  were  carried  out  within  6  to  48  h  after  sampling  following 
standard  operating  procedure  as  described  by  Clinical  Laboratory  Standards  Institute  (CLSI)  
guidelines  [17].  For  each  child’s  stool  and  cow-dung  sample,  a  faecal  suspension  was  prepared  by 
adding a portion of the specimen onto 2–3 mL of 0.1% peptone water to make it 1:10 dilution. One 
loop  full  of  faecal  suspension  was  streaked  onto  MacConkey  agar  and  was  incubated  at  37  °C  for  
24  h.  The  lactose  fermenting  colonies  were  initially  assessed  by  their  characteristic  growth  on 
MacConkey  agar.  Each  isolate  was  further  confirmed  by  standard  biochemical  tests  designated  for  
E.  coli  (indole,  methyl  red,  Voges-Proskauer,  and  citrate  utilization  test)  [17].  The  enumeration  of  
E. coli from drinking water was performed by a two membrane filtration technique using membrane 
lauryl sulphate agar incubated at 37 °C and 44 °C [18].  

2.4. Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing 

One  E.  coli  isolate  per  sample  was  tested  for  susceptibility  by  the  Kirby-Bauer’s  disk  diffusion 
method  against  the  following  antibiotic  groups:  tetracyclines  (tetracycline  30  µg),  penicillins 
(ampicillin/sulbactam 10 µg/10 µg), 2nd generation cephalosporins (cefuroxime 30 µg), 3rd generation 
cephalosporins  (cefotaxime  30  µg  and  cefixime  5  µg),  cotrimoxazole  (1.25  µg/23.75  µg), 
aminoglycosides (amikacin 30 µg) and quinolones (ciprofloxacin 5 µg, norfloxacin 10 µg and nalidixic 
acid 30 µg) [17]. This panel of antibiotics was selected based on the antibiotic prescription patterns in 
local hospitals and veterinary dispensaries, and the CLSI guidelines [17]. Overnight cultures, grown on 
trypticase soy broth (optical density adjusted to MacFarland 0.5), were spread evenly on Mueller-Hinton 
agar plates. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The zones of inhibition were measured and 
interpreted as resistant or sensitive according to CLSI guidelines [17].  

Co-resistance (resistance to two antibiotic groups) and multi-resistance (resistance to at least three 

different antibiotic groups) were recorded.  

2.5. Determination of Ciprofloxacin Minimum Inhibitory Concentration 

Minimum  inhibitory  concentration  (MIC)  values  for  ciprofloxacin  were  determined  by  an 
Epsilometer test  for  a  sub-set of  ciprofloxacin-resistant  isolates  (n  =  83).  Only  isolates  that  showed 
resistance  to  ciprofloxacin  (irrespective  of  resistance  to  other  antibiotics  or  not)  were  subjected  to 
MIC.  The  first  35%  isolates  from  each  sample  type,  from  each  district  were  serially  selected. 

 

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2012, 9 
 
Commercially available ciprofloxacin EzyMICTM Strips (HiMedia, Mumbai, India) with a MIC range 
of 0.002 to 32 µg were used following manufacturer’s instructions. E. coli ATCC 25922 was used as 
control strain in both Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion and epsilometer tests.

2.6. Statistical Analysis 

The data were entered in Excel version Office 2007 and then transferred to Stata 10.1 (Stata Corp. 
College  Station,  TX,  USA)  software  for  statistical  analysis.  Differences  in  prevalence  of  antibiotic 
resistance, co-resistance and multi-resistance between the two geographical regions were assessed by 
chi-square  test.  The  associations  of  resistance,  co-resistance  and  multi-resistance  with  household 
characteristics  within  the  two  geographical  regions  were  determined  by  odds  ratios  (OR)  with  95% 
confidence  intervals.  P  <  0.05  was  considered  statistically  significant.  In  the  tables,  the  values  of 
percentages are presented as integer numbers.

3.2. Antibiotic Resistance Pattern 

In our study, 92%, 90% and 96% of E. coli isolates from children’s stool, cow-dung and drinking 
water respectively, was resistant to at least one of the tested antibiotics. A comparison of the antibiotic 
resistance  pattern  of  E.  coli  isolates  from  children’s  stools,  cow-dung,  and  drinking  water  from  
non-coastal  and  coastal  environment  is  presented  in  Table  3.  E.  coli  isolates  from  the  non-coastal 
region,  regardless  of  type  of  sample,  showed  significantly  higher  resistance  prevalence  to  both  2nd 
generation cephalosporins (cefuroxime) and 3rd generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime and cefixime) 
and nalidixic acid. Norfloxacin resistance was significantly  higher in non-coastal cow-dung isolates. 
Ciprofloxacin  resistance  was  significantly  higher  in  non-coastal  drinking  water  isolates  only. 
Additionally,  non-coastal  cow-dung  and  drinking  water  E.  coli  isolates  had  significantly  higher 
prevalence  of  resistance  to tetracycline  and  ampicillin/sulbactam.  Although  not  significant, the  only 
exception  from  non-coastal  isolates  having  higher  resistance  prevalence  was  the  higher  amikacin 
resistance among E. coli isolates from children’s stool in the coastal region. 

Table  4  shows  the  co-resistance  and  multi-resistance  of  E.  coli  isolates  from  children’s  stool,  
cow-dung  and  drinking  water  from  the  non-coastal  and  coastal  environment  to  different  groups  of 
antibiotics.  In  general,  we  found  that  the  co-resistance  and  multi-resistance  in  E.  coli  isolates  was 
higher in the non-coastal as compared to the coastal region.

3.3. Association of Resistance, Co-Resistance and Multi-Resistance 

The  association  between  the  resistance  patterns  (co-resistance  and  multi-resistance)  of  E.  coli 
isolates and the type of sample, geographic location and the households’ information was estimated. In 
E. coli isolates from children’s stools, resistance was associated with geographical region (OR = 3.1, 
95%  CI  1.18–8.01,  P  =  0.021)  with  higher  prevalence  in  the  non-coastal  than  coastal  region. 
Furthermore, resistance was also associated with sex of the children. Boys had 2.9 times higher odds 
(95% CI 1.21–6.86, P = 0.016) to carry a resistant isolate than girls, irrespective of the region to which 
they  belonged.  Co-resistance  and  multi-resistance  were  not  associated  with  any  of  the  variables. 
Among E. coli strains isolated from cow-dung, resistance (OR = 3.6, 95% CI 1.59–8.03, P = 0.002), 
co-resistance (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.39–4.37, P = 0.002) and multi-resistance (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.12–4.34, 
P  =  0.022)  were  associated  with  geographical  region,  with  higher  prevalence  in  non-coastal  areas. 
Similarly, in E. coli isolates from drinking water, resistance (OR = 3.8, 95% CI 1.00–14.44, P = 0.049), 
co-resistance (OR = 3.2, 95% CI 1.36–7.41, P = 0.008) and multi-resistance (OR = 2.8, 95% CI 1.06–7.07, 
P  =  0.036)  were  associated  with  geographical  region  and  the  prevalence  was  higher  in  the  
non-coastal  region.  The  association  between  resistance  pattern  (resistance,  co-resistance  and  
multi-resistance) in E. coli isolates and household’s information within each geographical region was 
also estimated. Within the non-coastal region stratum the multi-resistance (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.21–8.51,  
P = 0.019) in E. coli isolates from children’s stool were higher among boys than the girls.  

Apart  from  the  above,  none  of  the  compared  variables  were  associated  with  resistance,  

co-resistance or multi-resistance in E. coli isolates.  

3.4. Ciprofloxacin MIC Determination 

Ciprofloxacin MIC values ranged from 8 to 32 μg/mL, regardless of type of sample and geographic 
location, as shown in Figure 1. E. coli isolates from children’s stools had significantly higher levels of 

 

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2012, 9 
 
resistance (≥24 µg/mL, P = 0.025) when compared to cow-dung and drinking water isolates. Amongst 
cow-dung E. coli isolates, the highest level of resistance (≥32 µg/mL) was observed in isolates from 
the  non-coastal  region  only.  Overall,  E.  coli  isolates originating  from  the  non-coastal  region  tended  
to  have  higher  levels  of  resistance  as  compared  to  those  from  the  coastal  region,  albeit  not  
statistically significant.

4. Discussion 

In  our  study  we  compared  antibiotic  resistance  in  two  regions  with  distinct  geographical  and 
environmental  attributes.  To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  study  investigating  the  association  of 
antibiotic  resistance  patterns  in  E.  coli  isolates  from  community  and  environmental  sources  like 
children’s  stools,  cow-dung  and  drinking  water  with  two  different  natural  environments  and  their 
attributes.  We  identified  a  higher  prevalence  of  resistance  in  isolates  from  all  the  sources  in  the  
non-coastal  area  compared  to  the  coastal  area.  Compared  to  the  coastal  region,  the  distinguishing 
contrasting  physical  and  natural  environmental  features  of  the  non-coastal  region  were—maximum 
temperature 11 °C higher, height from sea-level 190 meters more, forest cover about 12 times more, 
population density 4.6 times less and literacy rate nearly half. As there is a lack of studies similar to 
ours  it  is  difficult  to  say  whether  the  combined  influence  of  these  environmental  features  has  any 
contribution towards our results. In addition, the social environmental characteristics of these regions 
could also have contributed to the results.

High  prevalence  of  antibiotic  resistance  (92%  to  at  least  one  of  the  tested  antibiotics  and  24%  
multi-resistance) among normal faecal flora E. coli isolates from children was observed in our study. 
In  contrast,  a  previous  study  from  Tamil  Nadu,  India  carried  out  in  2005  found  a  prevalence  63% 
resistance to at least one antibiotic and 32% multi-resistance in E. coli in healthy children’s stools [19] 
and  a  study  in  Greece  conducted  in  1998  reported  that  40%  of  healthy  children  carried  resistant  
E. coli [20]. A community-based study among  young children  in Peru suggested that environmental 
contamination with resistant bacteria significantly contribute to children’s carriage of antibiotic-resistant 
E. coli [21]. Our study was conducted in villages in India, where sanitation generally is very poor and 
hence such a possibility cannot be ruled out in our study. Furthermore, we found that the prevalence of 
resistance in E. coli isolated from children’s stool was higher among boys than girls in the non-coastal 
region.  Somewhat  contradictory  data  are  available  from  other  contexts.  For  example,  a  community 
study  from  United  Kingdom  on  susceptibility  in  urinary  coliform  isolates  found  that resistance  was 
more  frequent  in  isolates  from  boys  [22],  whereas,  a  study  from  Greece  found  that  resistance  in 
commensal E. coli isolates was higher when they were from girls [20].  

Veterinary use of antibiotics has been shown to result in antibiotics resistance in commensal E. coli 
isolates  from  farm  cattle  faeces  [23].  A  study  in  Pennsylvania,  United  States  found  40%  
multidrug-resistance among E. coli isolates in cow-dung from healthy lactating cows (no information 
was  available  on  individual  antibiotic  treatment)  [24].  In  our  study  19%  multi-resistance  E.  coli 
isolates  were  observed  in  cow-dung,  although  participants  informed  that  only  5%  of  cows  had  
been  given  antibiotic  treatment.  Antibiotics  and  antibiotic  resistant  bacteria  in  soil  and  aquatic 
environment  [25]  and  antibiotic  resistant  E.  coli  from  human  and  animal  sources  [26]  have  been 
previously documented. The selection of resistant bacteria at very low antibiotic concentrations have 
also been reported [27]. A previous study found that faecal pollution in rural water and rural watershed 
was dominated by cattle [28] as the source of resistance bacteria. More than 80% of households in our 
study did not have latrines but followed open-air defecation practice, which could also be one of the 
pathways  for  spread  of  antibiotic  residuals  and  resistant  bacteria  in  the  grassland  and  aquatic 
environments [25]. In the area of our study, cows generally graze in open fields and besides household 
water  sources,  drink  water  from  open  water  sources  like  ponds,  rivulets,  stagnant  water  etc.  It  is 
possible that this  might have had a role to play  in the development of resistance of  E. coli detected  
in cow-dung. 

We  found  that  24%  of  E.  coli  isolated  from  drinking  water  was  multi-resistant.  A  study  in 
Hyderabad, Pakistan found 63% multi-resistance E. coli isolates from drinking water [29] and a study 
from Tamil Nadu, India found eight of nine drinking water samples were resistant to at least one tested 
antibiotic  [19].  The  importance  of  emerging  pathogens  in  drinking  water  has  been  documented 
globally [30]. Antibiotic resistant bacteria have been found in Indian aquatic environment e.g., hospital 
waste water [31].  

Some  comparative  antibiotic  resistance  studies  of  different  nature  are  found  in  the  literature. 
Regional  differences  in  antibiotic  resistance  have  previously  been  documented  [32,33]  and  it  is 
suggested  that  this  could  result  from  different  local  co-selective  events  like  antibiotic  pressure  and 
independent  clonal  spread  in  each  region  [33].  For  example,  E.  coli  isolates  from  point  sources 
(industrial and municipal effluents) have been shown to have higher resistance compared to nonpoint 
sources (land runoff and septic tank seepage) [34]. Previous studies from Tamil Nadu, India [19] and 
 

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2012, 9 
 
from South Africa [35] have shown that prevalence of antibiotic resistance among commensal bacteria 
was slightly higher in rural population compared to urban population. However a study among adults 
from eight developing countries found the contrasting result that the prevalence of resistance in faecal 
E. coli was more common in urban than in rural areas [36]. 

756 

In our previous qualitative study [37]  in the same settings the  healthcare professionals perceived 
that behavioural and social environmental factors along with biophysical environmental factors could 
contribute to resistance development in different geographical  settings. It was also found that in the 
non-coastal  region  of  “Malkangiri”,  there  is  a  lack  of  registered  allopathic  doctors,  hence  so  called 
“quacks” (persons with no medical qualification) and some of the homeopathic and ayurvedic (Indian 
system of medicine) healthcare providers commonly prescribe antibiotic treatment (although they are 
not legally authorised to prescribe antibiotics). Compared to this, in the coastal region of “Puri” healthcare 
facilities  are  better  and there  is  availability  of  higher  numbers  of  trained  allopathic  doctors  [37]. In 
both  cases  unnecessary  or  irrational  antibiotic  prescribing  might  be  present.  However,  the  trained 
healthcare providers could be expected to have comparatively more rational prescribing compared to 
the  untrained  prescribers.  Additionally,  in  the  present  study  antibiotic  use  among  children  in  the  
non-coastal areas might have been underestimated since 22% of the respondents did not know if their 
child had taken antibiotics in the last year, while the corresponding figure was only 3% in coastal areas. 
Irrational/unnecessary antibiotic treatment has been cited as a cause of resistance development [4,9]. 
Surprisingly, a previous study in tropical South America found that heavy use of chloroquine to treat 
malaria  likely  selected for ciprofloxacin resistance in  E. coli [38]. This  might be one reason for the 
relatively higher quinolone resistance in Malkangiri (non-coastal) as chloroquine has been a commonly 
used medicine due to endemic malaria.  

The  impact  of  antibiotics  or  resistant  bacteria  on  humans  might  happen  in  several  ways.  When 
contaminated food is ingested, the bacteria might transfer resistance determinants to other bacteria in 
the  human  gut,  so  called  horizontal  gene  transfer  [7,8,39].  Additionally,  antibiotic  residues  in  food 
products  or  water  may  allow  the  selection  of  antibiotic-resistant  bacteria  after  the  food  or  water  is 
consumed [10]. Through excretion resistant bacteria might flow from the gut of humans and animals 
into  soil/terrain  and  water.  Therefore,  there  might  be  interaction  between  E.  coli  from  the  natural 
environment (soil/terrain and water), humans and animals.  

The  main  strength  of  this  study  is  that  it  has  isolated  and  compared  E.  coli obtained  from  three 
different  sources  (children’s  stool,  cow-dung  and  drinking  water)  from  the  same  household  in  two 
different contrasting natural environments. Furthermore, it has determined the antibacterial susceptibility 
pattern  using  standardised  methods  for  the  obtained  isolates.  In  addition,  MIC  determination  was 
performed for a sub-set of ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates. However, there are some limitations in this 
study. In spite of collecting about 34% excess isolates in case of children’s stool, still the calculated 
number of isolates from drinking water could not be reached. Nevertheless, there were still significant 
differences  in  E.  coli  resistance  prevalence  to  most  of  the  antibiotics  tested  between  the  two 
geographical  regions.  However,  it  cannot  be  ruled  out  that  a  larger  sample  size  would  have  led  to 
significantly  different  results  between  the  two  regions  also  for  the  remaining  antibiotics.  Another 
limitation was that we tested only one isolate per sample. However, in our pilot study we tested five 
isolates  per  sample  and  obtained  almost  identical  resistance  patterns  for  all  isolates  from  the  same 

 

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2012, 9 
 
sample. Thus, as we had limited funding, we decided to only include one isolate from each sample in 
the main study.

5. Conclusions 

In conclusion, this study shows that the overall prevalence of antibiotic resistance in E. coli isolated 
from children’s stool, cow-dung and drinking water was high and even higher in the non-coastal than 
the  coastal  environment.  Our  findings  suggest  the  need  for  better  understanding  of  the  interaction 
between human and animal faecal bacteria and the environment. Furthermore, this study implies the 
need for better drinking water quality management in rural Odisha, India. In addition, these findings 
can be used for improving antibiotic management.
