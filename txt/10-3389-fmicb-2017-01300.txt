A total of 154 non-duplicate Salmonella isolates were recovered from 1,105 rectal
swabs collected from three large-scale chicken farms (78/325, 24.0%), three large-scale
duck farms (56/600, 9.3%) and three large-scale pig farms (20/180, 11.1%) between
April and July 2016. Seven serotypes were identiﬁed among the 154 isolates, with
the most common serotype in chickens and ducks being Salmonella enteritidis and
in pigs Salmonella typhimurium. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that high
antimicrobial resistance rates were observed for tetracycline (72.0%) and ampicillin
(69.4%) in all sources. Class 1 integrons were detected in 16.9% (26/154) of these
isolates and contained gene cassettes aadA2, aadA1, drfA1-aadA1, drfA12-aadA2,
and drfA17-aadA5. Three β-lactamase genes were detected among the 154 isolates,

detected among the 154 isolates, and most of the isolates carried qnrA (113/154),
followed by qnrB (99/154) and qnrS (10/154). Fifty-four isolates carried ﬂoR among the
154 isolates. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis showed that nine sequence
types (STs) were identiﬁed; ST11 was the most frequent genotype in chickens and ducks,
and ST19 was identiﬁed in pigs. Our ﬁndings indicated that Salmonella was widespread,
and the overuse of antibiotics in animals should be reduced considerably in developing
countries.

INTRODUCTION

Salmonella is an important source of foodborne diseases that cause morbidity and mortality
worldwide. Among 94 million cases of non-typhoid Salmonella infections, it was presumed that
approximately 85% of the cases were induced by food origin Salmonella (Chiu et al., 2010). In
China, Salmonella causes an estimated 22.2% of foodborne diseases (Wang et al., 2007). Many
Salmonella serovars exist. More than 2,600 serovars are classiﬁed based on the reactivity of antisera
to O and H antigens (Stevens et al., 2009), and the serovars from farms have a signiﬁcant overlap
with those causing illnesses in humans (Alcaine et al., 2006). Animals have been recognized as an
important reservoir for Salmonella, and this pathogen can be transferred to humans via the food
chain, posing a serious threat to human health (Vo et al., 2006).

Prevalence of Salmonella from Animals

The use of antimicrobials is important

for the control
and treatment of Salmonella. However, antimicrobial- and
multidrug-resistant Salmonella strains have emerged,
leading
to treatment
failure (Gong et al., 2013). The increasing
prevalence of multidrug-resistance among Salmonella, not only
against
the front-line antimicrobials, chloramphenicol and
clinically
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole but
important
and
ﬂuoroquinolones,
is also an emerging problem (Lunguya
et al., 2013).

The spread of the antibiotic resistant potential in Salmonella
is mainly attributed to integrons. Integrons are DNA elements,
capable of
and
disseminating them using a mobile genetic element (MGE)
such as a plasmid among bacteria. The class I integron is
the most common integron type identiﬁed in multidrug-
resistant (MDR) Salmonella and plays an important role in the
dissemination of resistance genes among pathogens (Wright,
2010).

genes

In developed countries, many surveys have been conducted
at the molecular level to monitor the incidence of antibiotic-
resistant Salmonella in animal farms (Melendez et al., 2010;
Graciela et al., 2016). However,
the extent of antibiotic-
resistant Salmonella in many developing countries and the
resistance remain
molecular mechanisms underlying this
unclear. Therefore, we selected large-scale animal
farms as
sample sites, collected swab samples, isolated Salmonella and
characterized the molecular mechanisms of antimicrobial
resistance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Samples and Salmonella Isolation
From April to July 2016, rectal swabs were collected from
healthy animals on farms in Qingdao, Jinan and Zibo regions
in Shandong Province, China. All of the sampling sites were
visited only once. In total, 1,105 samples were collected in a
random manner from chickens (n = 325), ducks (n = 600), and
pigs (n = 180). The samples were independently collected from
individual animals, and the sample collection conformed to the
cluster random sampling principle. Farms were chosen based
on their scale with the following requirements: for chickens,
the breeding stock was >150,000 heads; for ducks, the breeding
stock was >100,000 heads, and for pigs, the breeding stock was
>1,000 heads. The owners of each farm gave permission for
rectal swab samples to be collected. The animals from which
samples were extracted remained alive and did not undergo any
surgery. Therefore, ethical approval was not required for the
study because the sampling process did not harm the animals.
All of the collected samples were transported in an ice box to our
laboratory within 6 h for further bacteriological analysis.

Isolation and identiﬁcation of Salmonella were performed as
described previously (Yan et al., 2010), with some modiﬁcations.
Brieﬂy, swabbing samples were placed into a sterile plastic bag
containing 100 ml of buﬀered peptone water (BPW) and mixed
vigorously for 3 min. The BPW mixture was then incubated for

24 h at 37◦C for pre-enrichment. Approximately 1 ml of pre-
enrichment cultures were incubated in 10 ml of selenite cysteine
(SC) broth and 10 ml of rappaport-vassiliadis (RV) broth at 42◦C
for 24 h, respectively. After selective enrichment, a loop-full of SC
and RV broth cultures were streaked onto xylose lysine tergitol 4
(XLT4) agar and incubated at 37◦C overnight. A minimum of two
presumptive Salmonella colonies was conﬁrmed by PCR using a
previously described method (Malorny et al., 2003).

Salmonella Serotyping
According to the manufacturer’s instructions, the serogroup and
serovars of Salmonella isolates were determined according to the
Kauﬀmann-White scheme by slide agglutination with O and H
antigens (Tianrun Bio-Pharmaceutical, Ningbo, China).

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing
A minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) assay, as described
by the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (Clinical
Laboratory Standards Institute, 2013), was used in this study to
test the susceptibility of 12 commonly used antibiotics (Table 1),
including ampicillin (AMP), amikacin (AMK), enroﬂoxacin
(ENO), ciproﬂoxacin (CIP), nalidixic acid (NA), ﬂorfenicol
(FFN), tetracycline (TET), ceftiofur (CEF), gentamicin (GEN),
neomycin (NEO), levoﬂoxacin (LVX), and fosfomycin (FOS).
Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC
700603) were used as the quality control strains in this study.
Salmonella isolates resistant
to more than three classes of
antimicrobials were deﬁned as MDR isolates.

Detection of Class I Integrons and
Antimicrobial Resistance Genes
Bacterial DNA was extracted using a TIANamp Bacteria DNA
Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Conserved primers were used for the detection
and identiﬁcation of class I integrons using previously described
primers and procedures (Kerrnet et al., 2002). PCR screening
for β-lactamase-encoding genes blaTEM, blaPSE−1, blaSHV, and
blaCTX−M was performed as previously described (Li et al., 2013).

Prevalence of Salmonella from Animals

Furthermore, PCR ampliﬁcation was used to screen for plasmid-
mediated quinolone resistance genes, qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrD,
and qnrS, which were the most frequently observed in China,
using previously described primers (Ahmed et al., 2013). Finally,
the ﬂorfenicol resistance gene, ﬂoR, was detected using previously
described primers (Ahmed et al., 2013). The PCR products
were puriﬁed and subsequently sequenced (Invitrogen, Beijing,
China). The obtained DNA sequences were compared with those
in GenBank using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST).

MLST
Seven housekeeping genes (aroC, dnaN, hemD, hisD, purE,
sucA, and thrA) were used to characterize Salmonella by MLST.
MLST was performed as described online (http://mlst.warwick.
ac.uk/mlst/dbs/Senterica/documents/primersEnterica_html). All
polymerase chain reaction products were puriﬁed and sequenced
(Invitrogen, Beijing, China), and the alleles and STs were assigned
according to the MLST scheme at http://mlst.warwick.ac.uk/
mlst/dbs/Senterica.

Data Analysis
The statistical package SPSS (version 15.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL,
USA) was used to compare the prevalence and MDR resistance
rate of Salmonella isolated from chickens, ducks and pigs, and a
P-value less than 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.

RESULTS

Prevalence and Serotypes of Salmonella
In this study, a total of 154 non-duplicate Salmonella isolates
(154/1105, 13.9%) were recovered. From chickens, 78 Salmonella
isolates were recovered (78/325, 24.0%) (Table 2), which was
signiﬁcantly higher than the Salmonella isolated from ducks and
pigs (P < 0.05). Seventy-eight Salmonella isolates were divided
into six serovars. The most common serovar was Salmonella
enteritidis (69/78, 88.5%) (Table 3).

From ducks, 56 Salmonella isolates were recovered (56/600,
9.3%) (Table 2), and they were divided into two serovars. The
most common serovar was Salmonella enteritidis (38/56, 67.9%)
(Table 3).

From pigs, 20 Salmonella isolates were recovered (20/180,
11.1%) (Table 2), and they were divided into three serovars.
The most common serovar was Salmonella typhimurium (13/20,
65.0%) (Table 3).

Characteristics of Class I Integrons and
Antimicrobial Resistance Genes
Among the 78 isolates recovered from chickens, 17 isolates
(17/78, 21.8%) contained four groups of resistance gene cassettes,
consisting of drfA1-aadA1 (1.7 kb, n = 7), aadA2 (1.2 kb,
n = 5), drfA17-aadA5 (2 kb, n = 3), and aadA1 (1.2 kb, n =
2). Three β-lactamase genes were detected among the isolates,
and blaTEM−1 (n = 25) was the most commonly isolated β-
lactamase gene, followed by blaPSE−1 (n = 7) and blaCTX−M−55
(n = 4). Three plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes
were detected among the isolates. qnrA (n = 53) was the most
commonly isolated plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance gene,
followed by qnrB (n = 44) and qnrS (n = 7). In addition, 23
isolates carried ﬂoR (Table 3).

Among the 56 isolates recovered from ducks, eight isolates
(8/56, 14.3%) contained three groups of resistance gene cassettes,
consisting of aadA2 (1.2 kb, n = 4), drfA1-aadA1 (1.7 kb, n = 3),
and drfA12-aadA2 (2 kb, n = 1). Three β-lactamase genes were
detected among the isolates. blaTEM−1 was the most commonly
isolated β-lactamase gene (n = 20), followed by blaPSE−1(n = 2)
and blaCTX−M−55 (n = 1). Three plasmid-mediated quinolone
resistance genes were detected among the isolates. qnrA was the
most commonly isolated plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance
gene (n = 44), followed by qnrB (n = 40) and qnrS (n = 2). In
addition, 13 isolates carried ﬂoR (Table 3).

Among the 20 isolates recovered from pigs, one isolate
(1/20, 5.0%) contained one group of a resistance gene cassette,
consisting of aadA2 (1.2 kb, n = 1). Three β-lactamase genes were

detected among the isolates. blaTEM−1 was the most commonly
isolated β-lactamase gene (n = 10), followed by blaCTX−M−55 (n
= 6) and blaPSE−1 (n = 5). Three plasmid-mediated quinolone
resistance genes were detected among the isolates. qnrA was the
most commonly isolated plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance
gene (n = 16), followed by qnrB (n = 15) and qnrS (n = 1). In
addition, 18 isolates carried ﬂoR (Table 3).

MLST
A total of nine STs among the 154 isolates were found. ST11
was the most common ST in both chickens and ducks, and it
was represented by 69 and 38 Salmonella isolates, respectively.
ST19 was the most common ST in pigs, and it was represented
by eight Salmonella isolates (Table 3). The STs in this study were
correlated with speciﬁc serovars, such as ST11 with Salmonella
enteritidis, ST19 and ST34 with Salmonella typhimurium, and
ST40 with Salmonella derby.

DISCUSSION

In this study, Salmonella spp. were recovered from chickens,
ducks and pigs in Qingdao, Jinan and Zibo regions. For the
chickens, the prevalence (24.0%) was signiﬁcantly higher than
that reported in Shanghai, China (4.5%) (Liu et al., 2010) but was
lower than that reported from chicken farms in Egypt (41.0%)
(Hanem et al., 2017). The prevalence (9.3%) in ducks was similar
to that obtained from duck farms in Sichuan province (12.0%)
(Li et al., 2013) but was lower than those reported in Penang,
Malaysia (39.0%) (Adzitey et al., 2012), and in South Korea
(65.2%) (Cha et al., 2013). For pigs, the occurrence ratio (11.1%)
was similar to those reported in previous studies of Salmonella
spp. in food products of animal origin in China (Jiang et al.,
2006; Li et al., 2013) but was higher than that reported from
conventional farms (3.5%) in Korea (Migma et al., 2015). Data
on the prevalence of Salmonella in diﬀerent studies were diﬃcult
to compare based on diﬀerences in regions, collection seasons,
sample types, isolation methodologies, culture methods, culture
media, and environmental conditions.

For serotyping, a total of seven serovars were found among
the 154 isolates, including six from chickens, two from ducks,
and three from pigs. The most common serotype in chickens
and ducks was Salmonella enteritidis. This result was consistent
with those from Shanxi province (Yang et al., 2010), but it
was diﬀerent from other reports that the dominant serotype in
chicken farms was Salmonella Colindale in Chad (Tabo et al.,
2013). The most common serotype in duck farms was Salmonella

typhimurium (Martelli et al., 2016). The dominant serotype in
pigs was Salmonella typhimurium, which was the most common
serovar isolated from humans and it can lead to severe human
and animal diseases (Deng et al., 2012), but it was diﬀerent from
other studies, where the dominant serotype in pig farms was
Salmonella IIIb in Henan province (Kuang et al., 2015), and
Salmonella derby in England and Wales (Miller et al., 2011). The
diﬀerence in dominant serotype among animals may be due to
diﬀerences in the pathogenicity of two serovars, geographical
regions and diversities (Volf et al., 2010; European Centre for
Disease Prevention Control, 2013).

Antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella is a threat to human
public health. As shown in Table 3, the high rates of antimicrobial
resistance were against
tetracycline (72.0%) and ampicillin
(69.4%) in all sources, which was similar to reports of Salmonella
isolates from Africa,
in which chickens exhibited resistance
to tetracycline (93.0%) and ampicillin (47.0%) (Zishiri et al.,
2016). These high resistance rates are due to its wide use
in animal feed and were consistent with other reports (Piras
et al., 2011; Shao, 2011; Bai et al., 2015). In addition, resistance
to ciproﬂoxacin in 35.9% of chickens, 80.4% of ducks, and
30.0% of pigs deserves our attention because resistance to
this antimicrobial agent may lead to the delay or failure of
ﬂuoroquinolone therapies (Van et al., 2007). In this study, all
of the isolates were susceptible to amikacin, which may be
because this antimicrobial is not used for therapeutic purposes
in veterinary medicine or as a growth promoter in conventional
animal fattening, and the result was consistent with other reports
(Eva et al., 2015). In this study, MDR Salmonella isolates were
frequently observed among chickens, ducks and pigs. In addition,
MDR Salmonella is serotype-dependent (Clemente et al., 2014):
the data provided evidence that Salmonella indiana, Salmonella
typhimurium and Salmonella enteritidis were strongly associated
with MDR phenotypes. Of particular concern, MDR strains could
transfer to humans via animal or animal-derived products and
pose a great risk to public health (Rosangela et al., 2016).

In this study, our results related to the incidence of class I
integrons (26/154, 16.9%) were similar to the report in Sichuan
(Li et al., 2013) but were higher than those reported in the
USA, as class I integrons were identiﬁed in only 2.8% of the
Salmonella isolates from bulk milk and milk ﬁlters (Van et al.,
2013). In the present study, the incidence of class I integrons
was signiﬁcantly higher in Salmonella from chickens (21.8%)
than Salmonella from pigs (5.0%). In addition, in this study, the
Salmonella isolates carrying class I integrons included Salmonella
enteritidis, typhimurium and indiana.

Prevalence of Salmonella from Animals

Production of β-lactamases is considered to be the main
mechanism of resistance in Gram-negative bacteria to overcome
penicillin-derived antibiotics, and the blaTEM and blaCTX−M
ESBLs can hydrolyse third and fourth generation cephalosporins.
In this study, a total of three β-lactamase genes were detected
among the Salmonella isolates recovered from chickens, ducks
and pigs: blaTEM−1, blaPSE−1, and blaCTX−M−55. Most of the
isolates carried blaTEM−1, which was similar to the report in
South Africa that blaTEM−1 was the most commonly identiﬁed
β-lactamase gene in Salmonella isolates from food-producing
animals (Igbinosa, 2015). In addition, in this study, most isolates
carried blaTEM−1 and blaCTX−M−55, which confer resistance to
ampicillin.

Quinolones are the ﬁrst choice for the treatment of invasive
and systemic salmonellosis that occurs in humans and animals
(Dimitrov et al., 2007). A total of three quinolone resistance genes
were detected among the Salmonella isolates recovered from
chickens, ducks and pigs: qnrA, qnrB and qnrS. qnrA was the
most commonly isolated plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance
gene consistent with a report in Henan, where qnrA, qnrB and
qnrS were identiﬁed in Salmonella strains isolated from retail
food with an incidence of 46.6, 12.7, and 19.5%, respectively
(Yang et al., 2013). It is well known that qnr genes confer
only low-level resistance to ﬂuoroquinolones, and accumulation
of quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) mutations
is necessary for S. enterica to be resistant to ﬂuoroquinolone,
especially ciproﬂoxacin (Eaves et al., 2004). In this study, most
Salmonella isolates containing a plasmid-mediated quinolone
resistance gene were resistant to ciproﬂoxacin, nalidixic acid and
gentamicin.

Florfenicol, a new chemosynthesis broad spectrum antibiotic
of chloramphenicol analogs,
is a ﬂuorinated derivative of
thiamphenicol. It is not approved for human use. In this study,
ﬂoR was identiﬁed in 35.1% of Salmonella strains isolated from
chickens, ducks and pigs, which was signiﬁcantly higher than
that reported in Egypt (1.0%) (Ahmed and Shimamoto, 2012).
In addition, ﬂoR was identiﬁed in 90.0% of Salmonella strains
isolated from pigs in this study. In this study, most Salmonella
isolates containing the ﬂoR gene were resistant to ﬂorfenicol.

MLST results reveal that a total of nine STs were identiﬁed
in this study. ST11 was the most frequent genotype that was
recovered in chickens and ducks, and ST19 was the most frequent
genotype that was recovered in pigs. ST11 belongs to Salmonella
enteritidis, and ST19 belongs to Salmonella typhimurium; they
all have continually been reported to cause human salmonellosis
in recent years (Cai et al., 2016; Kang et al., 2017). In addition,
our results revealed that the MLST patterns were generally
associated with serotypes and provided a reliable prediction of the
Salmonella serovars, which was consistent with previous research
(Achtman et al., 2012).

CONCLUSION

The prevalence of Salmonella was higher in the animal farms.
Moreover, many serovars reported in humans and MDR
Salmonella were recovered in this study. The high rates of
MDR Salmonella, class I integrons and antibiotic resistance
gene positive isolates detected suggest that measures must be
taken to facilitate the reasonable use of antimicrobials in animal
husbandry. Therefore, continuous surveillance of Salmonella and
associated antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella of animals is
essential to detect emerging Salmonella serovars and associated
resistance genes.
