SUMMARY

A variety of foods and environmental sources harbor bacteria that are resistant to one or more antimicrobial drugs used in medicine 
and agriculture. Antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli is of particular concern because it is the most common Gram-negative pathogen 
in humans. Hence this study was conducted to determine the antibiotic sensitivity pattern of E. coli isolated from different types of 
food items collected randomly from twelve localities of Hyderabad, India. A total of 150 samples comprising; vegetable salad, raw 
egg-surface, raw chicken, unpasteurized milk, and raw meat were processed microbiologically to isolate E. coli and to study their 
antibiotic susceptibility pattern by the Kirby-Bauer method. The highest percentages of drug resistance in isolates of E. coli were 
detected from raw chicken (23.3%) followed by vegetable salad (20%), raw meat (13.3%), raw egg-surface (10%) and unpasteurized 
milk (6.7%). The overall incidence of drug resistant E. coli was 14.7%. A total of six (4%) Extended Spectrum β-Lactamase (ESBL) 
producers were detected, two each from vegetable salads and raw chicken, and one each from raw egg-surface and raw meat. Multidrug 
resistant strains of E. coli are a matter of concern as resistance genes are easily transferable to other strains. Pathogen cycling through 
food is very common and might pose a potential health risk to the consumer. Therefore, in order to avoid this, good hygienic practices 
are necessary in the abattoirs to prevent contamination of cattle and poultry products with intestinal content as well as forbidding the 
use of untreated sewage in irrigating vegetables.

BACKGROUND

Escherichia coli is the most prevalent facultative anaerobic species 
in the gastrointestinal tract of human and animals, usually a harmless 
microbe, but it is also a medically important bacteria causing a number 
of significant illnesses14.

Vegetables may be contaminated through insufficiently-treated water 
and fertilizers or may be compromised by the use of biocides during 
cultivation7. Similarly, animals can also become infected from water or 
food contaminated with wastes of human or animal origin or with human 
carrier workers. One of the possible ways of entry of various microbes 
could be the handling of meat and meat products by adopting improper 
hygienic measures during handling and processing20.

Raw  meat  and  vegetables  are  particularly  likely  to  carry  large 
numbers of bacteria. The same E. coli and Klebsiella spp. serotypes 
have  been  found  in  food  and  in  the  patients  who  consumed  it11,12. 
A  sterile  diet  was  shown  to  lower  the  number  of  E.  coli  serotypes 
found  in  the  feces  of  test  persons6.  Bacteria  escaping  alive  through 
the digestive tract to the colon are often transient13, the resident flora 

having  a  protective  effect  against  intruders.  The  transfer  of  drug 
resistance within the gastrointestinal tract is still possible; thus, if our 
food contains substantial numbers of resistant bacteria, it could be an 
important source of resistance in fecal flora.

It has been suggested that resistance in bacterial populations may 
spread  from  one  ecosystem  to  another18.  The  wild  dissemination  of 
antimicrobial resistance among bacterial populations is an increasing 
problem worldwide.

Antibiotics are often used for therapy of infected humans and animals 
as  well  as  for  prophylaxis  and  growth  promotion  of  food  producing 
animals. Many findings suggest that inadequate selection and abuse of 
antimicrobials may lead to resistance in various bacteria and make the 
treatment of bacterial infections more difficult21. Antimicrobial resistance 
in E. coli has been reported worldwide. Treatment for E. coli infection 
has  been  increasingly  complicated  by  the  emergence  of  resistance  to 
most  first-line  antimicrobial  agents32.  Over  the  years,  resistance  to 
cephalosporins  among  members  of  enterobacteriaceae  has  increased 
mainly  due  to  the  spreading  of  Extended-spectrum  β-Lactamases 
(ESBL)40.

As commensal bacteria constitute a reservoir of resistance genes for 
(potentially) pathogenic bacteria, their level of resistance is considered 
to be a good indicator for selection pressure by antibiotic use and for 
resistance  problems  to  be  expected  in  pathogens24.  Hence  the  aim  of 
this study was to determine the antibiotic sensitivity pattern of E. coli 
isolated from different types of food items collected from in and around 
the Hyderabad city of Andhra Pradesh, India. The result of this study 
demonstrated that organisms harboring Extended Spectrum β-Lactamase 
(ESBL) enzymes are multi-drug resistant showing resistant to 12 or more 
drugs tested and thus, could pose serious challenge to the public health.

the edge of the plate. Plates were inverted and incubated aerobically at 
35+2 °C for 16 to 18 hours. The zone of inhibition and resistance was 
measured, recorded, and interpreted according to the recommendation 
of the CLSI (NCCLS 2002). The ATCC strain of E. coli 25922 was used 
as a control strain. All the bacteriological media and antimicrobial disks 
were purchased from HiMedia Laboratories, Mumbai, India. Isolates with 
resistance or with decreased susceptibility to any of the 3rd Generation 
Cephalosporin (3GC) were selected for further study.

Extended Spectrum β-Lactamase (ESBL) Confirmatory Tests

METHODS

A  total  of  150  samples  each  comprising  30  numbers;  vegetable 
salad  (carrot,  cucumber,  cabbage,  tomatoes,  spinach,  lettuce,  beet 
root and radish), raw egg-surface, raw chicken, unpasteurized milk of 
buffalo,  and  fresh  raw  meat  of  sheep  were  collected  randomly  from 
twelve different localities of Hyderabad. All samples were aseptically 
collected and then packaged in sterile polythene zip bags and carried 
to the laboratory in aseptic conditions in a cold box within two hours 
from the time of purchase. Duplicate samples were obtained whenever 
possible. All samples were analyzed within 2-4 hours after their arrival 
to the laboratory. A sharp sterile knife was used to cut samples from 
surfaces in sterile trays.

To isolate bacteria, a 25-g portion of samples (in case of eggs, each 
egg separately) was placed into sterile 225 mL Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) 
for 6-8 h at 37 ºC.

Culture  in  TSB  was  streaked  onto  MacConkey’s  agar  (MAC) 
plates and incubated for 18-24 hours at 35+2 °C. Lactose fermenting 
colonies were picked and identified8 by gram stain, motility and standard 
biochemical  tests,  viz.,  catalase,  oxidase,  fermentation  of  lactose  and 
glucose using triple sugar iron agar, production of indole, methyl red 
test, voges proskauer test, urease test and utilization of citrate.

Samples were also processed to isolate other medically important 
food  borne  pathogens  like  Salmonella  spp,  Staphylococcus  aureus 
and Bacillus cereus. Biochemically confirmed isolates of E. coli were 
subjected to antimicrobial sensitivity testing.

Antimicrobial  Susceptibility  Testing:  Susceptibility  tests  were 
performed  using  the  Kirby-Bauer  method  on  Mueller-Hinton  agar  in 
accordance  with  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards  Institute  (CLSI; 
formerly NCCLS) guidelines (NCCLS 2002)26 and using 19 antibacterial 
agents: Ampicillin  (10  mcg), Amoxycillin  (25  mcg), Amoxyclav 
(20/10  mcg  (30  mcg)), Aztreonam  (30  mcg),  Cefotaxime  (30  mcg), 
Ceftazidime (30 mcg), Ceftriaxone (30 mcg), Chloramphenicol (30 mcg), 
Ciprofloxacin (5 mcg), Colistin (10 mcg), Co-trimoxazole (1.25/23.75 
mcg),  Gentamicin  (10  mcg),  Imipenem  (10  mcg),  Meropenem  (10 
mcg),  Ofloxacin  (5  mcg),  Piperacillin+tazaobactum  (100/10  mcg), 
Streptomycin (10 mcg), Tetracycline (30mcg), and Tigecycline (15 mcg).

The E. coli isolates were inoculated in nutrient broth and incubated 
at 35+2 °C for five h. The broth was diluted in normal saline solution to 
a density of 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard. Cotton swabs were used 
for streaking the diluted broth onto Mueller-Hinton agar plates. After air 
drying, antibiotic discs were placed 30 mm apart and 10 mm away from 

342

Double Disc Synergy Test (DDST)17: The isolated colonies were 
inoculated  in  nutrient  broth  at  35+2  °C  for  five  h. The  turbidity  was 
adjusted  to  0.5  McFarland  standard  and  lawn  culture  was  made  on 
Mueller-Hinton agar using sterile swab. An Augmentin disc (20/10 mcg) 
was placed in the center of plate. Both sides of the Augmentin disc, a 
disc of cefotaxime (30 mcg) and ceftazidime (30 mcg), were placed with 
center to center distance of 15 mm to the centrally placed disc. The plate 
was incubated at 35+2 °C overnight. ESBL production was interpreted as 
the 3rd-generation cephalosporin disc, inhibition was increased towards 
the Augmentin disc or if neither discs were inhibitory alone but bacterial 
growth was inhibited where the two antibiotics were diffused together.

Phenotypic Confirmatory Disc Diffusion Test (PCDDT) for ESBL25: 
ESBL  production  was  confirmed  among  potential  ESBL-producing 
isolates by phenotypic tests. Lawn culture of the organism was made and a 
3rd-generation cephalosporins ceftazidime (30 mcg) disc and ceftazidime 
+ clavulanic acid (30 mcg + 10 mcg) disc was placed with 25 mm apart. 
An increase of ≥ 5 mm in zone of inhibition for ceftazidime + clavulanic 
acid compared to ceftazidime was confirmed as ESBL producers.

95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  was  calculated  for  incidence,  drug 
resistance  and  ESBL  production  in  E.  coli  strains. The  difference  in 
resistant  and  susceptibility  pattern  between  ESBL  and  non-ESBL 
producers of E. coli strains results was analyzed statistically using X2 
testing and p value of ≤ 0.05 was regarded as significant.

RESULTS

A total of 99 (66%) biochemically confirmed isolates of E. coli were 
isolated from a total of 150 different food items as listed in Table 1. All 
99 isolates of E. coli tested for their antibiotic profile against 19 different 
antimicrobial agents.

Resistance  to  one  or  more  antimicrobial  agents  was  found  in  22 
(14.7%) isolates of E. coli detected from the total of 150 samples and a 
pattern of multiple drug resistance was observed (Table 2). The dominant 
type of resistance was to ampicillin and amoxicillin identically detected 
in  20  (13.3%)  isolates,  followed  by  tetracycline  in  19  (12.6%),  co-
trimoxazole in 17 (11.3%), streptomycin in 12 (8%), ciprofloxacin and 
ofloxacin in 10 (6.6%) each, cefotaxime in 8 (5.3%), and gentamicin, 
chloramphenicol, and amoxyclave in 7 (4.6%) of each isolates. Twenty 
two E. coli isolates elicited 18 different patterns of antibiotic resistance 
to the agents used in this study (Table 2). None of the isolate was found 
resistant to imipenem, tigecycline and colisitin.

Of the 22 isolates of E.coli, eight were screened according to CLSI 
guidelines and selected for conformational tests of ESBL, namely, DDST

and PCDDT. Of these eight isolates, six isolates found ESBL-positive by 
the DDST were also ESBL-positive by the PCDDT and the remaining 
two isolates found ESBL-negative by both the techniques. Thus, a 100 
per cent concurrence was noted in the results obtained by the DDST and 
PCDDT for the eight isolates tested retrospectively. All the six strains of 
ESBL-producing E. coli, showed enhanced susceptibility to ceftazidime 
and/or cefotaxime in the presence of clavulanic acid, a typical finding 
for an ESBL producer.

A significant difference in resistant and susceptibility pattern was 
found between ESBL and non-ESBL producers of E. coli strains (Table 
2). In all the cases p value was < 0.05. Among non-ESBL producers 
only  two  isolates  showed  resistant  to  3rd  generation  cephalosporin, 
cefotaxime. Whereas all six ESBL producers were resistant to all 3GC 
tested  and  also  to  aztreonam.  Moreover,  only  ESBL  producers  have 
exhibited resistance to meropenem and piperacillin+tazobactum. Among 
six ESBL producers one strain was resistant to meropenem and another 
to piperacillin+tazobactam. All the six ESBLs were sensitive only to 
imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin + tazaobactum, tigecycline, colistin, 
chloramphenicol, gentamicin, streptomycin, ciprofloxacin and amoxyclav 
in different patterns.

The  number  of  antibiotics  against  which  each  isolate  showed 
resistance ranged between one and 14. Among the non-ESBL producers, 
two  were  exhibited  resistant  to  two  different  single  antibiotics 
(Tetracycline and Co-trimoxazole respectively), six were found to be 
resistant  to  less  than  five  antibiotics,  five  showed  resistance  to  5-7 
antibiotics  and  three  showed  resistance  to  8-9  antibiotics.  In  case  of 
ESBL producers, one isolate was resistant to 12 antibiotics, four to 13 
antibiotics and one to 14 antibiotics.

DISCUSSION

Antimicrobial  resistance  has  been  recognized  as  an  emerging 
worldwide  problem  in  human  and  veterinary  medicine2,10  both  in 
developed  and  developing  countries.  It  is  also  well  documented  that 
widespread use of antibiotics in agriculture and medicine is accepted as a 
major selective force in the high incidence of antibiotic resistance among 
gram-negative bacteria23. A variety of foods and environmental sources

on  large  plasmids,  and  these  also  carry  genes  for  resistance  to  other 
antimicrobial agents31.

Several studies have documented the drug resistant E. coli and other 

coliforms in vegetables29, poultry18, egg4, milk9 and raw meat35.

Fig. 1 - Antibiotic resistance flow chart in bacteria and the environment36.

In this study, the highest percentages of drug resistance in isolates of 
E.coli were detected from raw chicken (23.3%) followed by vegetable 
salad (20%), raw meat (13.3%), raw egg-surface (10%) and unpasteurized 
milk (6.7%). The overall incidence of drug resistant E. coli was 14.7%.

Antibiotic resistance in E. coli is of particular concern because it is 
the most common Gram-negative pathogen in humans, the most common 
cause of urinary tract infections, a common cause of both community 
and hospital-acquired bacteraemia33 as well as a cause of diarrhea19. In 
addition, resistant E. coli strains have the ability to transfer antibiotic 
resistance determinants not only to other strains of E.coli, but also to 
other bacteria within the gastrointestinal tract and to acquire resistance 
from other organisms28.

Different use patterns of antimicrobial agents are expected to have 
some impact on the distribution of antimicrobial resistance phenotypes1,22 
and  possibly  of  resistant  determinants.  The  result  of  the  antibiotic 
resistance analysis revealed that among 16 non-ESBLs, only four and two 
isolates had similar antibiotic patterns to four and five drugs respectively. 
All the six ESBLs had different patterns of drug resistance.

Current work revealed that all the co-trimoxazole resistant isolates 
except  one  were  multi-drug  resistant.  In  E.  coli,  trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole  resistance  often  correlates  with  the  presence  of 
dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) 
genes in integrons15,39. Multiple antibiotic resistance may be acquired 
through  mobile  genetic  elements  such  as  plasmids,  transposons,  and 
class 1 integrons34.

The number of studies describing the prevalence of ESBL-producing 
Enterobacteriaceae has increased rapidly around the world36. A total of 
six (4%) ESBL producers were detected in this study, two each from 
vegetable salads and raw chicken, and one each from raw egg-surface 
and raw meat. No ESBL producer was detected in the unpasteurized milk.

The  result  of  this  investigation  shows  that  organisms  harboring 
Extended  Spectrum  β-Lactamase  enzymes  are  multi-drug  resistant 
showing resistant to 12 or more drugs tested and thus, could pose serious 
challenge to the public health. ESBLs are often encoded by genes located 

344

In recent years, ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates have 
shifted  from  the  hospital  to  the  community  and  the  environment27. 
ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae have been recovered from different 
sources in the community, including cattle, chickens, pigs, raw milk, and 
lettuce16,30,37, and a recent study from India reported that a substantial 
number of tap water samples were contaminated with carbapenemase 
blaNDM-1 producing organisms38. Most of the studies on this subject have 
been conducted in developed countries, but the major epicenters of ESBL-
expressing bacteria are located in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East36.

CONCLUSIONS

Even though the incidence of multidrug resistant and ESBL producers 
were not high in our study but still it is a matter of concern, since there 
is a reservoir of antibiotic resistant genes within the community, and 
that the resistance genes and plasmid-encoded virulent genes are easily 
transferable  to  other  strains.  Pathogen  cycling  through  food  is  very 
common and might pose a potential health risk to the consumer.

Therefore, cautions are necessary to decrease the incidence of multi-
drug resistant strains of E. coli in animals and people. In order to achieve 
this, good hygienic practices are necessary from the farm to the family 
table especially in the abattoirs to prevent contamination of cattle and 
poultry products and abattoir environment with intestinal content. Health 
authorities  should  focus  on  implementing  the  legislation  that  forbids 
irrigation with untreated sewage water of both root and leafy vegetables.

Furthermore,  there  is  a  need  to  emphasize  the  rational  use  of 
antimicrobials  and  strictly  adhere  to  the  concept  of  “reserve  drugs” 
to minimize the misuse of available antimicrobials in agriculture and 
medicine. In addition, regular antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance 
is essential.

RESUMO

Resistência microbiana a drogas em linhagens de Escherichia coli 

isoladas de fontes alimentares

Variedade de alimentos e fontes ambientais contem bactérias resistentes 
a uma ou mais drogas antimicrobianas usadas em medicina e agricultura. 
Resistência antibiótica pela Escherichia coli é particularmente preocupante 
porque ela é o patógeno mais comum Gram negativo em humanos. Portanto 
este  estudo  foi  conduzido  para  determinar  o  aspecto  de  sensibilidade 
antibiótica da E. coli isolados de diferentes tipos de alimentos obtidos ao 
acaso de 12 localidades de Hyderabad, India. Um total de 150 amostras 
compreendendo saladas, vegetais, superfícies de ovos crus, galinhas cruas, 
leite não pasteurizado e carne crua foram processados microbiologicamente 
para isolar E. coli e estudar o quadro de sensibilidade antibiótica pelo 
método de Kirby-Bauer. A maior percentagem de resistência à droga foi 
isolada de E. coli obtidos de galinha crua (23,3%) seguido de saladas e 
vegetais (20%), carne crua (13,3%), superfície do ovo cru (10%) e leite 
não pasteurizado (6,7%). Incidência total de E. coli resistente foi de 14,7%. 
Um total de seis (4%) Extended Spectrum β-Lactamase (ESBL) produtores 
foram detectados, dois cada de salada de vegetais e galinha crua e um cada 
de superfície de ovo cru e carne crua. Espécies resistentes a múltiplas
