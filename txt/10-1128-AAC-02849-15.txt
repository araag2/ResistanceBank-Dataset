The aim 30 of this study was to identify genes conferring resistance to fluoroquinolones and 31 extended spectrum β-lactams in non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) from 32 food-producing animals and patients in China. In total, 133 and 21 NTS isolates 33 exhibiting concurrent resistance to ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime were cultured 34 independently from animals and human cases from 2009~2013. All of the isolates 35 were identified, serotyped and subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. 36 Importantly, the isolates with concurrent resistance to ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime 37 were all confirmed as S. enterica serovar Indiana. The presence of fluoroquinolone 38 resistance genes and extended-spectrum-β-lactamases (ESBLs) was established by 39 PCR and DNA sequencing. The occurrence and diversity of different genes conferring 40 fluoroquinolone resistance [qepA, oqxAB and aac(6')-Ib-cr] with mutations in 41 topoisomerase-encoding genes (gyrA and parC) and several ESBLs (including 42 CTX-M-65, CTX-M-27, CTX-M-15, CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-14/CTX-M-15) was 43 noteworthy. Genes encoded on mobile genetic elements were identified by 44 conjugation and transformation. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) used to 45 determine the genetic relationships between these isolates generated 91 pulsotypes 46 from 133 chicken isolates and 17 pulsotypes of the 21 clinical isolates that showed 47 considerable diversity. Analysis of the pulsotypes obtained between the isolates 48 showed some clones appeared to have existed for several years and that had been 49 disseminating between food-producing animals and humans. This study highlights the 50 emergence of ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime co-resistant S. enterica serovar Indiana 51 posing a threat to public health.  52 3   INTRODUCTION 53 Salmonellosis, caused by Salmonella enterica, is a global food-borne disease of 54 humans and livestock worldwide (1, 2). A total of 91,034 cases of human 55 laboratory-confirmed Salmonella infections and 61 fatal cases were reported in 2012 56 in 27 European countries (3). In high-income regions of North America, there are an 57 estimated 1.0 million Salmonella infections per year (4). In China, approximately 75% 58 (30 million) of the food-borne diseases every year are attributed to this bacterium (5). 59 Specifically, children younger than 5-years were the group most at risk of infection by 60 Salmonella as noted in data obtained across several cities in China (2, 6, 7).  61 Salmonellosis is generally a self-limiting illness; however, antimicrobial agents 62 may be required in severe cases, particularly in immune-compromised individuals, 63 children and the elderly (8). Fluoroquinolones and extended-spectrum β-lactams are 64 the front-line drugs of choice for treating salmonellosis (6, 9). However, in recent 65 years, an increase in the occurrence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella spp. 66 expressing resistance to these compounds has been observed in several countries. 67 Dissemination of antimicrobial resistance among non-typhoidal Salmonella isolates in 68 humans is thought to be predominantly due to the use of antimicrobial agents in food 69 animals (6, 10). Furthermore, infections with such drug-resistant Salmonella species 70 are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. 71 Ciprofloxacin resistance is mainly attributed to mutations of quinolone 72 resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of the genes encoding the target bacterial 73 topoisomerase enzymes (11). The presence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance 74 (PMQR)-encoding genes may also contribute to the ciprofloxacin resistance 75 phenotype (12). Although these PMQR genes confer only low-level resistance to 76 fluoroquinolones, the presence of PMQR (particularly qnr genes) may provide a 77 selective advantage for bacteria exposed to fluoroquinolones and facilitate 78 development of high-level chromosomal quinolone resistance.  79 On the other hand, it is acknowledged that the horizontal transfer of plasmids 80 carrying the ESBL genes is an important contributory factor in the epidemiology of 81 this bacterial ecosystem. The predominant ESBLs families of clinical importance 82 include TEM, SHV, and CTX-M (13). In Salmonella, the most commonly found 83 ESBLs types in Asia are those of the CTX-M group, which are usually located on 84 transmissible plasmids that have the capacity to disseminate among members of 85 Enterobacteriaceae (13). In other regions of the world such as in the US and Canada, 86 the AmpC β-lactamase, CMY-2, is the major contributor to ceftriaxone resistance in 87 Salmonella (14).  88 Recently, concurrent resistance to ceftriaxone/cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin S. 89 enterica serovar Indiana has been reported in isolates cultured from food-producing 90 animals (15, 16). Salmonella spp. have a variety of animal reservoirs and routes of 91 4   transmission that can result in human infection (17). However, foods of animal origin, 92 especially poultry and poultry products, are often involved in sporadic cases and 93 outbreaks of human salmonellosis (15) and contaminated raw or undercooked chicken 94 as primary vehicles of Salmonella transmission to human beings (18). Consequently, 95 concurrent resistance to ceftriaxone/cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin S. enterica serovar 96 Indiana poses a risk to humans and these features limit the treatment options available 97 when the organisms are encountered. Currently, there is limited information 98 describing the molecular epidemiology of ceftriaxone/cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin 99 co-resistant S. enterica serovar Indiana isolates.  100 Therefore, the objectives of this study are to investigate and characterise those 101 genes conferring resistance to cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin in co-resistant S. enterica 102 serovar Indiana isolates from both humans and food-producing animals in China. 103 MATERIALS AND METHODS 104 Ethics statement 105 The fecal samples were acquired with the written informed consent from the 106 patients. This study was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of China 107 National Center for food safety Risk Assessment, CFSA, according to the medical 108 research regulations of the Ministry of Health, China. This research 109 was conducted within China. 110 Bacteria and growth conditions 111 In total, 133 S. enterica serovar Indiana isolates with concurrent resistance to 112 ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime were recovered from poultry slaughterhouses (10.1%, 113 n=1320, isolates from whole chicken carcasses after dehairing and pre-cooling bath) 114 were collected from 3 cities (Hebi [n=88], Kaifeng [n=40] and Luohe [n=5]) in Henan 115 Province from February through November in 2012. Twenty-one S. enterica serovar 116 Indiana isolates with concurrent resistance to ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime were 117 cultured from patients (2.6%, n=802, isolates from fresh fecal swabs) in five different 118 geographical regions (Dengfeng [n=1], Jiyuan [n=5], Shangqiu [n=7], Zhenzhou [n=3] 119 and Zhoukou[n=5]) in 28 sentinel hospitals and 6 regional CDC diagnostic 120 laboratories located in Henan Province from 2009 to 2013. The age of the patients 121 varied from 1 month to 70 years in which more than half was less than 2 years (Table 122 1).  123 The protocols for isolating bacteria from animals used a modified method based 124 on the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection 125 Service (FSIS) Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook (USDA/FSIS, 2008) and 126 protocols applied to patient samples were described previously (19). Finally, both 127 isolates from animals and patients with typical Salmonella phenotypes were 128 confirmed by the API 20E test (bioMérieux, Beijing, China) and amplification of the 129 invA gene by PCR (20). For selecting concurrent resistance to ciprofloxacin and 130 5   cefotaxime in Salmonella isolates, all confirmed isolates were incubated in LB 131 supplemented with 1 mg/L ciprofloxacin and 4 mg/L cefotaxime. For all of the 132 Salmonella isolates that grew, serotypes were determined by slide agglutination with 133 commercial Salmonella antisera (Statens Serum Institute, Denmark) following the 134 Kauffmann-White scheme.  135 Antimicrobial susceptibility testing 136 Antimicrobial susceptibility of all the Salmonella isolates was determined by 137 agar dilution method and interpreted according to the Clinical and Laboratory 138 Standards Institute guidelines (CLSI 2012)(21) and the European Committee on 139 Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST-2012; www.eucast.org). The following 140 antimicrobial compounds were assessed: ampicillin, cefotaxime, 141 cefotaxime-clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, ceftazidime-clavulanic acid, 142 chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, tetracycline, tigecycline and 143 trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Multidrug resistance was defined as resistance to 144 three or more different classes of agents. Isolates with MIC values for either 145 cefotaxime or ceftazidime of 1 mg/L were further screened for ESBLs production by 146 determination of synergy between 0.25 and128 mg/L ceftazidime or cefotaxime and 4 147 mg/L clavulanate. Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 148 700603 were used as quality control organisms in antimicrobial susceptibility tests.  149 PCR Amplification and DNA sequence analysis 150 The quinolone resistance determination regions (QRDRs) of gyrA, gyrB, parC 151 and parE in Salmonella isolates were amplified by PCR as described previously (11). 152 All the Salmonella isolates were screened by PCR for transferable quinolone 153 resistance-encoding genes (PMQR) including, qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrD, qnrS, oqxAB, 154 aac-(6’)-Ib and qepA as previously described (11, 12). A multiplex PCR was used to 155 screen for blaCTX-M in all the ESBL-producing isolates (22). Another multiplex PCR 156 method was applied to screen for plasmid-mediated AmpC encoding genes in 157 clavulanic acid resistant isolates (23). All the PCR products were directly sequenced 158 (Takara Biotechnology Cooperation, Dalian, China) for sequence analysis and aligned 159 using the BLAST program (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/).  160 Plasmid replicon typing and conjugation experiment  161 Salmonella isolates were examined for the presence of 18 replicon (Inc) types by 162 polymerase chain reaction-based replicon typing [PBRT] (24). Transfer of resistance 163 was tested by filter mating assays. Conjugation experiments were performed with 164 Salmonella isolates as donors using a modified laboratory-based method and E.coli 165 MG1655 as the recipient (25). Transconjugants were selected as pink colonies on 166 MacConkey agar plates containing cefotaxime (4 mg/L), PCR and subsequently 167 S1-PFGE was performed to re-confirm the plasmid profiles in these transconjuctions 168 (6). 169 6   Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) 170 All Salmonella isolates were sub-typed by PFGE to determine their DNA 171 fingerprint profiles following digestion by the macrorestriction enzyme XbaI (New 172 England Biolab, Beijing LTD) according to the procedures developed by the Centers 173 for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PulseNet program (26). The interpretation 174 of the PFGE patterns was performed with BioNumerics software (Applied Maths, 175 St-Martens-Latern, Belgium) using the Dice Similarity coefficient. Dendrograms were 176 constructed on the basis of the Unweighted Pair Group Method of Averages (UPGMA), 177 position tolerance of 1%. Clusters were defined as DNA patterns sharing ≥85% 178 similarity. 179  180 RESULTS 181 Antimicrobial susceptibility testing 182 All 154 S. enterica serovar Indiana isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 183 cefotaxime, ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin and susceptible to imipenem and 184 tigecycline. Resistance to chloramphenicol was common (98.7%, 152/154), followed 185 by gentamicin (96.1%, 148/154), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (92.2%, 142/154) 186 and tetracycline (81.2%, 125/154) (Table 2). All Salmonella isolates expressed a 187 multidrug resistant phenotype (being resistant to at least three different classes of 188 antimicrobial compounds). In total, 12 antimicrobial resistance profiles were 189 identified among 154 S. enterica serovar Indiana isolates. The dominant resistant 190 profiles identified were determined to be AMP-CAZ-CHL-CIP-CTX-GEN-SXT-TET 191 (n=109) and AMP-CAZ-CHL-CIP-CTX-GEN-SXT (n=27), from both chicken 192 (87.2%, 116/133) and human (95.2% 20/21) isolates. In total, one hundred and fifty 193 three isolates (99.4%, 153/154) were confirmed as ESBLs-positive.  194  195 Identification of quinolone resistance-encoding genes 196 Of all 154 S. enterica serovar Indiana isolates, four-point mutations in QRDRs 197 were found in 152 isolates, of which 80 possessed amino acid substitutions in GyrA 198 (S83F, D87G), ParC (T57S, S80R) as the dominant types (51.9% ,80/154) along with 199 72 isolates that contained GyrA (S83F, D87N) , ParC (T57S, S80R) alleles. 200 Three-point mutations were identified in 2 isolates from poultry slaughterhouses with 201 the amino acid substitutions in GyrA (S83F), ParC (T57S, S80R).  202 PMQR-encoding genes were identified in 143 isolates (92.9%, 143/154) from 203 both chicken (n=122) and human (n=21) isolates, including, aac (6')-Ib-cr (n=117), 204 oqxAB (n=112), qepA (n=2). The following PMQR genes, including qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, 205 qnrD and qnrS were not detected. Ninety-eight isolates (63.6%, 98/154) possessed 206 more than one PMQR gene(s). Compared to the chicken isolates (60.9%, 81/133), 207 human isolates (81.0%, 17/21) showed a higher prevalence with two PMQR genes. 208 7   Ciprofloxacin MIC was measured and determined to be between 8 to 128 mg/L in all 209 these isolates. 210 Among 132 ciprofloxacin highly resistant (MIC ≥32 mg/L) isolates that included 211 112 poultry and 20 human isolates, four topoisomerase point mutations were detected 212 in each of 130 isolates and a further three in two isolates. PMQR genes were 213 identified in 127 isolates (two PMQR genes=96, one PMQR gene=31) and five 214 isolates only were negative for any of the PMQR genes. Among 37 isolates that 215 demonstrated a ciprofloxacin MIC ≥128 mg/L, these possessed four point mutations 216 in QRDRs with two PMQR genes [aac(6')-Ib-cr, oqxAB], of which 27 contained the 217 amino acid substitutions in GyrA (S83F, D87N) , ParC (T57S, S80R) and 10 with the 218 amino acid substitutions in GyrA (S83F, D87G), ParC (T57S, S80R). 219  220 Identification of β-lactamase resistance-encoding genes  221 Five blaCTX-M subtypes were identified among the 153 ESBLs-positive 222 Salmonella isolates, including blaCTX-M-65 (n=131), blaCTX-M-14 (n=15), blaCTX-M-15 223 (n=5), blaCTX-M-27 (n=1), and blaCTX-M-14 /blaCTX-M-15 (n=1). Salmonella isolates 224 containing blaCTX-M-65 were recovered from both poultry slaughterhouses (n=121) in 225 all sampling cities and from humans (n=10). Salmonella isolates containing 226 blaCTX-M-14 were also recovered from poultry slaughterhouses (n=11) in Hebi (n=3) 227 and Kaifeng (n=8) and humans (n=4). The remaining three blaCTX-M sub-types were 228 only detected in human isolates. Only three strains were AmpC-producing isolates 229 and these were cultured from poultry slaughterhouses. The blaCMY-2 gene was 230 identified in two ESBLs isolates with blaCTX-M-14 from Kaifeng and one clavulanic 231 acid resistant isolate from Luohe. 232  233 Association between extended-spectrum β-lactamase and plasmid-mediated 234 quinolone resistance genes 235 Among all 154 S. enterica serovar Indiana, the most frequent combination of 236 aac(6')-Ib-cr with oqxAB was in CTX-M-65-producing strains (n=89). The 237 combination of oqxAB with qepA was also only found in two CTX-M-65-producing 238 isolates with the amino acid substitutions in GyrA (S83F), ParC (T57S, S80R). 239 Isolates containing blaCTX-M-14 also possessed two PMQR genes, one PMQR gene and 240 none PMQR gene respectively. Isolates with blaCTX-M-15 contained two PMQR genes 241 or one PMQR gene. 242  243 Plasmid replicon typing and conjugation experiment  244 Among 154 isolates, 106 isolates carried at least one replicon type and six 245 different plasmid Inc types were detected ranging from one to three in these isolates. 246 The three most prevalent replicon types identified by PBRT included IncN (91.5%, 247 8   97/106), IncA/C (9.4%, 10/106) and IncI1-Ir (6.6%, 7/106). IncN was detected in all 248 bacterial isolates that were positive for the blaCTX-M-65 gene. IncA/C, IncFIA, IncFIB, 249 IncF and IncI1-Ir were only detected in isolates positive for blaCTX-M-14 and blaCMY-2 250 genes. Forty randomly selected poultry isolates containing different plasmid Inc types 251 along with 21 clinical isolates were selected as donors in the conjugation experiments. 252 Five transconjugants were obtained. Conjugative transfer frequencies recorded, 253 ranged from 10-7 to 10−8 transconjugants per recipient. Analysis of the plasmids in 254 these transconjugants identified IncA/C, IncI1-Ir, IncN types along with three other 255 isolates whose plasmid replicon types could not be confirmed with the primer sets 256 used. Transconjugants obtained using S. enterica serovar Indiana as donors, harboured 257 plasmids with sizes ranging from 130- to 285-kbp (Fig. 1, Table 3). Genes present in 258 the transconjugants included oqxA, oqxB, aac(6')-Ib-cr, blaCTX-M-14, blaCTX-M-15 and 259 blaCTX-M-65 (Fig. 1, Table 3). 260  261 PFGE analysis of Salmonella isolates  262 Ninety-one pulsotypes were identified among the 133 S. enterica serovar Indiana 263 from chicken by PFGE and 14 different clusters were denoted as clusters CC1-CC14 264 (Fig. S1). There were separate 18 PFGE patterns containing more than one isolate. 265 Isolates grouped into the same PFGE patterns mostly were recovered from the same 266 regions, but 4 indistinguishable pulsotypes contained isolates from different regions. 267 Some isolates within the same pulsotype possessed the same type of blaCTX-M but not 268 the same QRDR or PMQR profiles. The blaCTX-M-65 gene was identified in isolates in 269 81 pulostypes. Cluster CC1-1 had greatest number of high-level resistant 270 ciprofloxacin (MIC, ≥128 mg/L) isolates. In contrast, cluster CC13 and CC14 271 contained isolates with CTX-M-14 (Fig. S1). The 21 clinical isolates were divided 272 into 17 pulsotypes (Fig. 2). The predominant pulsotype was denoted as 273 INDX11.CN009, which included three isolates from the same city. Two pulsotypes 274 (INDX11.CN004 and INDX11.CN007) were found to contain two each, and the 275 remaining 14 pulsotypes contained a single isolate (Fig. 2).  276 DNA fingerprint comparisons between isolates cultured from food-producing 277 animals and patients by PFGE exhibited diversity among the strains. Three pulsotypes 278 (INDX11.CN005; INDX11.CN010 and INDX11.CN012) included isolates both from 279 chicken and humans (Fig. 2). Some of the remaining pulsotypes from patients showed 280 highly similar profiles with those from food-producing animals (Fig. 2). The results 281 further confirmed that some predominant clones may have existed in Henan for 282 several years and chicken should be a source of concurrent resistance to ciprofloxacin 283 and cefotaxime S. enterica serovar Indiana in humans. 284  285 DISCUSSION 286 9   In this study, we collected ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime co-resistant S. enterica 287 serovar Indiana isolates both from processed chicken in poultry slaughterhouses and 288 patients in Henan province which is one of the largest production centers in China for 289 broiler meat processing. Genes conferring resistance to fluoroquinolones and 290 extended spectrum β-lactams in these isolates were characterised and the collection of 291 bacteria was sub-typed by PFGE.  292 In the present study, our focus was to characterize Salmonella isolates that were 293 resistant to both fluoroquinolone and third-generation cephalosporin. All were 294 identified as serovar Indiana and interestingly this serovar has also been reported in 295 livestock in Beijing and Guangdong (15, 16) suggesting that it has a board 296 geographical distribution in China. Our data showed that 10.1% of the isolates 297 cultured from chicken were co-resistant to cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin a feature 298 previously reported by Wang et al (16), suggesting this strain seems to have become 299 established in some poultry flocks in China. Human clinical Salmonella isolates that 300 were resistant to these two antimicrobial compounds recently reported in S. enterica 301 serovar Kentucky ST198-X1, a much less prevalent serotype from France (27) and in 302 S. enterica serovar Typhimurium from China (28). In this study, only 2.6% of the 303 isolates from humans were identified as cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin co-resistant S. 304 enterica serovar Indiana which was first reported by our study. With the large-scale 305 use, of antimicrobial compounds over time, Salmonella isolates expressing resistance 306 to critically important antimicrobial agents such as fluoroquinolone and/or 307 extended-spectrum cephalosporin have been detected when cultured from animals and 308 patients in numerous locations with variable prevalence in China (15, 16, 28). 309 The emergence of cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin co-resistant S. enterica serovar 310 Indiana warrants continuous monitoring of the trend for development of antimicrobial 311 resistance in China. 312 Double amino acid substitutions in GyrA (S83F, D87N) / GyrA (S83F, D87G), 313 ParC (T57S, S80R) were noted in most of the study isolates. No mutations were 314 detected in either gyrB nor parE. These data are consistent with previous reported that 315 showed only those mutations in gyrA and parC mediate quinolone and 316 fluoroquinolone resistance. 317 PMQR-encoding genes were identified in 143 isolates a number that was higher 318 than previous studies reported (29, 30) but similar with the report by Jiang et al (15). 319 Furthermore, two PMQR-encoding genes co-existing in a single isolate were 320 frequently detected, a feature that was rarely observed in isolates from other countries 321 (29). The frequent use of olaquindox as a growth promoter in animals has been 322 suggested to exert a high selective pressure driving the acquisition of oqxAB and 323 contributing to its subsequent dissemination (28). Uniquely, one of the isolates 324 possessed three amino acid substitutions (denoted as W102R, D179Y, A160G) in 325 10   aac(6')-Ib-cr (31). Two others were detected with a qepA gene which was identified 326 previously in E. coli. To our knowledge, this is the first description of qepA in S. 327 enterica serovar Indiana in China and this gene has only been reported previously in S. 328 enterica serovar Typhimurium from Spain (32) and China (28). The qepA gene was 329 found in CTX-M-65-producing isolates alone, along with substitutions in GyrA (S83F) 330 and ParC (T57S, S80R). These data suggested that the acquisition of this transferable 331 quinolone resistance gene might be a rare event. Although PMQR confers only 332 low-level quinolone resistance, it can facilitate the emergence of high-level resistance 333 via mutation(s) in one or more of the topoisomerase genes (33). However, in most 334 isolates, two PMQR-encoding genes combined with multiple mutations in 335 topoisomerase genes resulted in high-level resistance to ciprofloxacin (MIC, ≥128 336 mg/L).  337 The ESBLs screening and characterization for these S. enterica serovar Indiana 338 showed that different variants of CTX-M family of β-lactamase were detectable in S. 339 enterica serovar Indiana and that they most likely contributed to the cefotaxime 340 resistance phenotypes of the host isolates. Sub-types of blaCTX-M genes identified in 341 humans isolates were more variable compared to those identified in food-producing 342 animals, which suggests that there were other sources in addition to chickens. The 343 blaCTX-M-65 was the predominant type existing both in food-producing animals and 344 humans and these differed from the types reported earlier in S. enterica serovar 345 Kentucky ST198-X1(blaCTX-M-1 / blaCTX-M-15) (27) and in S. enterica serovar 346 Typhimurium (blaCTX-M-14 ) (28). And also, genotypes blaCTX-M-14 and blaCTX-M-27 have 347 been found in S. enterica serovar Indiana isolates from chickens and pigs in 348 Guangdong (15) and blaCTX-M-24 was identified in S. enterica serovar Indiana from 349 chickens in Shandong (25). Why the predominant blaCTX-M in ciprofloxacin and 350 cefotaxime co-resistant S. enterica serovar Indiana isolates was blaCTX-M-65 in Henan 351 was not clear, but it suggests that the selection, dissemination and maintenance of 352 transmissible elements encoding these genes can occur during exposure to any of the 353 agents to which resistance is conferred. Interestingly, blaCTX-M is often located on 354 conjugative plasmids. It has been reported that ciprofloxacin-resistant S. enterica 355 serovar Kentucky ST198-X1 acquired the genes conferring resistance to 356 extended-spectrum cephalosporins only recently (27) and certain genotypes such as 357 blaCTX-M-55 are borne on plasmids that may have originated from E. coli possessing the 358 ability to disseminate to Salmonella and other bacterial species (34). Conjugative 359 systems in Gram-negative bacteria support transfer of mobile genetic elements 360 between different genera and in this study five transconjugants (8.25%, 5/61) were 361 obtained. According to the S1-PFGE, most of these harboured large plasmids of 362 greater than 200-kbp (data not show). Previously, several carbapenemase resistance 363 mechanisms (such as KPC, OXA-48, NDM, VIM) have been identified in S enterica 364 11   (27). None of the isolates in this study were found to be resistant to imipenem, though 365 surveillance for the emergence of these types of S. enterica serovar Indiana should be 366 undertaken as a routine assay. 367 The PFGE profile variation of the 154 isolates from poultry slaughterhouses and 368 humans demonstrated extensive genetic heterogeneity. Several bacterial isolates from 369 the same sampling place exhibited similar or indistinguishable PFGE pulsotypes 370 suggesting the potential for cross-contamination. Similar PFGE patterns of isolates 371 from different regions highlighted the possibility for the clonal spreading of some 372 co-resistant strains. When PFGE patterns were compared between bacteria cultured 373 from food-producing animals and humans this further confirmed the existence of 374 clones in Henan for several years. Most notably, the pulsotypes (INDX11.CN005, 375 INDX11.CN010, INDX11.CN012) from food-boring animals and chickens suggested 376 that chicken should be a source of these co-resistant S. enterica serovar Indiana in 377 humans. 378  379 CONCLUSION 380 Characterization of the genetic basis for resistance to both third-generation 381 cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone resistance identified plasmids as a major 382 contributing factor. Transmission of resistance genes such as those encoding 383 ESBLs, OqxAB and AAC(6')-Ib-c in Salmonella will facilitate the selection of these 384 MDR Salmonella, posing a threat to public health. On-going surveillance by 385 regulatory agencies is required to identify routes of transmission.   386  387 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by Beijing Natural Science 388 Foundation (7154252)  389  390 CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS None to declare391  12  References  392 1.
