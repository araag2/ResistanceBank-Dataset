Abstract 

The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  investigate  the  antimicrobial  resistance  in 

thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. isolated from different stages of the poultry meat supply 

chain in Argentina. Six poultry meat chains were studied from the reproductive farm to the 

chicken  at  the  retail.  Chickens  sampled  along  each  food  chain  were  from  the  same  batch. 

Samples collected were: a) cloacal samples from hens and chickens on the farm, b) chicken 

carcasses from the slaughterhouse and  retail  market.  Samples obtained were  examined for 

Campylobacter spp. Antimicrobial resistance was evaluated using the disk diffusion method. 

Almost  all  isolates  were  resistant  to  nalidixic  acid  (91.2%)  and  ciprofloxacin  (88.2%).  A 

large  proportion  of  thermotolerant  Campylobacter  isolated  from  hens  and  broilers  <1  wk 

showed resistance to erythromycin in comparison with the rest of the stages of the poultry 

meat  supply  chain  (P=  0.031).  Campylobacter  isolated  from  broilers  (both  <1  wk  and  >5 

wk)  and  carcasses  at  slaughterhouse  and  at  retail  showed  a  proportion  of  resistance  to 

ciprofloxacin  and  enrofloxacin  higher  than  isolates  from  hens  (P=  0.015  and  P=  0.031, 

respectively).  One  strain  was  resistant  to  all  the  antibiotics  analyzed,  and  46.1%  of  the 

isolates  were  resistant  to  three  or  more  drug  classes.  Almost  50%  of  the  isolates  were 

resistant to all quinolones tested (ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, and enrofloxacin), and 13.2% 

were  resistant  to  all  quinolones  and  erythromycin.  Campylobacter  strains  isolated  from 

carcasses at retail showed higher resistance to all quinolones than strains isolated from hens 

(P= 0.016). These results reflect an alarming situation with potential serious consequences 

to the public health.

1. Introduction 

Diarrheal  diseases  are  leading  causes  of  childhood  illness  and  death  in  developing 

countries  (Zaidi  et  al.,  2008).  Thermotolerant  Campylobacter,  especially  Campylobacter 

jejuni,  is  recognized  as  responsible  for  food-borne  gastro-enteritis  and  diarrheal  diseases 

worldwide (Avrain et al., 2003). In Argentina thermotolerant Campylobacter was found as 

the  most  important  gastrointestinal  pathogen  in  humans  (with  an  incidence  rate  of  22.4% 

and  13.6%  for  children  under  3  years  and  adults,  respectively)  (Fuentes,  2010).  These 

pathogens  are  frequently  found  in  the  intestinal  tract  of  a  wide  variety  of  wild  and 

domesticated animals, especially birds and animal origin foods, in particular poultry meat, 

are known to be the most important source of human campylobacteriosis (Signorini et al., 

2013; EFSA 2010). 

Although  most  cases  of  campylobacteriosis  may  be  asymptomatic  or  may  cause 

diarrheas and other serious sequels such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (Avrain et al., 2003). 

Antimicrobial  treatment  is  only  necessary  for  systemic  infections  (or  in  immune-

compromised  patients)  and  severe  or  long-lasting  Campylobacter  infections  (Luber  et  al., 

2003).  Macrolides  and  fluoroquinolones  (particularly  erythromycin  and  ciprofloxacin)  are 

the  first-  and  second-choice  antimicrobials  for  that  purpose.  Intravenous  aminoglycosides 

are also recommended for the treatment of serious Campylobacter bacteremia (Kassa et al., 

2007).  Resistance  to  antimicrobials,  particularly  to  macrolides  and  fluoroquinolones,  has 

been reported to be increasing (Avrain et al., 2003; Luber et al., 2003). In Argentina, only 

few studies have evaluated the antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter strains (Tamborini 

et al., 2012; Pantozzi et al., 2010) with a low number of strains analyzed. Additionally, no 

epidemiological  studies  in  Argentina  have  assessed  the  prevalence  of  Campylobacter

resistant  to  antibiotics  on  the  whole  food  chain  from  farm  to  fork.  This  information  is 

essential to establish a public health program to control the disease and it is considered as a 

starting point for a future monitoring program.  

In  poultry  meat  supply  chain  there  are  a  variety  of  environments  which 

thermotolerant Campylobacter have to adapt to survive. Biofilm formation is a strategy for 

Campylobacter  survival  in  suboptimal  conditions  such  as  temperature  variation,  aerobic 

atmosphere, and nutrient starvation (Brown et al., 2014). Biofilm appears to be an important 

reservoir of viable planktonic cells resistant to antimicrobials (Bae et al., 2014). 

Regarding  the  methods  to  evaluate  the  antimicrobial  resistance,  disk  diffusion 

method for aminoglycosides, quinolones, erythromycin, and tetracycline has showed a high-

level  correlation  with  agar  dilution  method.  Disk  diffusion  method  was  considered  as  a 

reliable,  easy-to-use  and  inexpensive  method  for  susceptibility  testing  of  thermotolerant 

Campylobacter spp., especially for screening purposes (Luangtongkum et al., 2007).  

The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  investigate  the  antimicrobial  resistance  in 

thermotolerant  Campylobacter  isolated  from  different  stages  of  the  poultry  meat  supply 

chain in Argentina. The criteria used to interpret susceptibility testing results were only for 

epidemiological monitoring purposes. 

 

2. Materials and methods 

2.1. Collection of Campylobacter isolates  

A  total  of  152  thermotolerant  Campylobacter  were  isolated  from  six  poultry  meat 

supply chains in Santa  Fe region in Argentina (Zbrun et al., 2013). The stages sampled in 

each poultry meat chain were: a) hens from breeder flocks, b) broilers in flocks (aged <1 wk

and > 5 wk), c) chickens at the slaughterhouse, and d) chicken meat at the retail market. The 

chickens sampled along the meat supply chain were from the same batch (defined as a group 

of chickens from the same flock, sent to the same slaughterhouse at the same time, and sold 

together at the same retail market). A total of 555 samples were collected from: a) cloacal 

samples from hens (n= 75) and chickens <1 wk (n= 180) and >5 wk (n= 180) on the farms, 

b) chicken carcasses from the slaughterhouse (6 – 7 wk of age) (n= 60) and the retail market 

(n= 60).  

Campylobacter  spp.  were  isolated  using  the  selective  media  Bolton  Broth  and 

Preston  Agar  (Bolton  and  Coates,  1983).  All  incubations  were  performed  under 

100 

microaerophilic  conditions  (5%  O2,  10%  CO2  and  85%  H2).  Preliminary  identification  of 

101 

thermotolerant  Campylobacter  spp.  was  based  on  colony  morphology,  microscopic 

102 

appearance  (curved  Gram-negative  bacilli  with  typical  motility),  and  the  following 

103 

phenotypic  characteristics:  oxidase  and  catalase  production,  and  hippurate  hydrolysis 

104 

reaction (Lior, 1984). All presumptive Campylobacter isolates were identified to the species 

105 

level (C. jejuni and C. coli) by multiplex PCR, as proposed by Vandamme et al. (1997). The 

106 

negative isolates were tested by PCR for C. lari (Klena et al., 2004). The positive isolates 

107 

were  subsequently  purified  on  Columbia  blood  agar  and  stored  in  glycerol  broth  (15% 

108 

glycerol and 85% serum broth) at -80 ºC (Terzolo et al., 1987). 

109 

2.2. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing 

110 

The  antimicrobial  sensitivity  of  Campylobacter  isolates  was  tested  by  the  disk 

111 

diffusion  assay  as  recommended  by  the  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards  Institute  in  the 

112 

standard M100-S23 (CLSI, 2013). Strains were removed from the freezer and streaked onto 

113 

Columbia blood agar and then incubated for 48 h at 42ºC under microaerophilic conditions. 

5 

 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT114 

Several  colonies  were  transferred  to  a  tube  with  5  ml  of  Mueller-Hinton  broth  to  reach  a 

115 

standard  inoculum  adjusted  to  0.5  McFarland.  Sterile  cotton-tipped  swabs  were  used  to 

116 

transfer  the  inocula  onto  Mueller-Hinton  agar  supplemented  with  5%  sheep  blood. 

117 

Antimicrobial disks were added after drying the plates for 5 min. The antimicrobials tested 

118 

were:  ampicillin  (10  µg)  (Britania),  erythromycin  (15  µg)  (Britania),  tetracycline  (30  µg) 

119 

(Britania),  nalidixic  acid  (30  µg)  (Britania),  enrofloxacin  (5  µg)  (Oxoid),  ciprofloxacin  (5 

120 

µg) (Britania), and gentamicin (10 µg) (Britania). The plates were incubated for 24 h at 42 

121 

ºC under microaerophilic conditions. C. jejuni ATCC 33560 was used as a reference strain. 

122 

The  zones  of  growth  inhibition  were  evaluated  according  to  the  standards  of  the  National 

123 

Committee for Clinical  Laboratory  Standards  (NCCLS) (Nobile et al., 2013).  If an isolate 

124 

was resistant to three or more drug classes, it was considered multi-drug resistant.  

125 

2.3. Statistical analysis  

126 

Chi-squared  and  Fisher´s  exact  two-tailed  test  were  used  to  compare,  for  each 

127 

antibiotic, the distributions of resistant Campylobacter isolates according to the stages of the 

128 

poultry  meat  supply  chain,  using  Infostat  software  (Universidad  Nacional  de  Córdoba, 

129 

Argentina).

3. Results 

132 

Table  1  shows  the  frequency  of  isolation  of  thermotolerant  Campylobacter  species 

133 

according to the stage of the poultry meat chain. Results showed the following distribution: 

134 

69.1%  (n=  105)  was  C.  jejuni,  28.3%  (n=  43)  was  C.  coli,  and  2.6%  (n=  4)  of  positive 

135 

samples were not possible to identify to species level. C. jejuni represented at least 68.2% of 

136 

the Campylobacter species in the samples collected from broilers in the farm (at both ages) 

6 

 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT137 

and carcasses at the slaughterhouse and the retail market. In contrast, the proportions of C. 

138 

coli and C. jejuni in the samples collected from hens were similar (47.2%).  

139 

The  lowest  resistance  was  observed  for  gentamicin  (7.9%)  and  erythromycin 

140 

(28.3%), while almost all isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid (91.2%) and ciprofloxacin 

141 

(88.2%).  Table  2  shows  the  frequency  of  C.  jejuni  and  C.  coli  isolates  resistant  to  the 

142 

antimicrobials  tested.  C.  coli  showed  higher  resistance  for  tetracycline  than  C.  jejuni  (P= 

143 

0.039). For the other antibiotics, the proportions of resistance were similar for both species 

144 

(P> 0.05) (Table 2). Regarding the four isolates of Campylobacter spp., that could not be 

145 

identified to species level, the four were resistant to ampicillin, two to erythromycin, one to 

146 

gentamicin, three to ciprofloxacin, three to nalidixic acid, three to tetracycline, and two to 

147 

enrofloxacin. 

148 

The  proportion  of  thermotolerant  Campylobacter  isolates  resistant  to  ampicillin, 

149 

gentamicin, nalidixic acid, and tetracycline was similar for all the stages of the poultry meat 

150 

supply  chain  (P>  0.05).  Almost  50%  of  the  thermotolerant  Campylobacter  spp.  isolated 

151 

from hens were resistant to erythromycin, whereas the proportion of resistant isolates from 

152 

broilers >5 wk and carcasses at the slaughterhouse and the retail was lower than 21.4% (P= 

153 

0.010,  P=  0.019,  and  P=  0.048,  respectively).  On  the  other  hand,  the  proportion  of 

154 

thermotolerant  Campylobacter  spp.  isolated  from  broilers  >5  wk  and  carcasses  at  the 

155 

slaughterhouse and at retail resistant to ciprofloxacin was higher than that of isolates from 

156 

hens  (P=  0.018,  P=  0.013,  and  P=  0.009,  respectively).  Additionally,  the  proportion  of 

157 

thermotolerant Campylobacter strains isolated from carcasses at slaughterhouse and at retail 

158 

resistant to enrofloxacin was higher than that of isolates from hens (P= 0.011 and P= 0.052, 

159 

respectively).  Campylobacter  strains  isolated  from  broilers  >5  wk  and  carcasses  at 

7 

 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT160 

slaughterhouse  and  at  retail  showed  non-significant  differences  in  the  proportion  of 

161 

resistance to the antibiotics tested (P> 0.05) (Table 2).  

162 

Only two isolates were sensitive to all the antibiotics tested and one was resistant to 

163 

all  the  antibiotics  analyzed.  Thirty-one  different  resistance  patterns  were  identified,  being 

164 

ampicillin,  ciprofloxacin,  nalidixic  acid,  and  tetracycline  (n=  17;  11.2%),  ampicillin, 

165 

ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, and enrofloxacin (n= 15; 9.9%), and ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, 

166 

nalidixic acid, tetracycline, and enrofloxacin (n= 15; 9.9%), the most common combinations 

167 

(Table  3).  About  46.1%  of  the  isolates  were  resistant  to  three  or  more  drug  classes. 

168 

Multidrug-resistant  isolates  were  associated  with  the  poultry  meat  supply  chain  stage  (P= 

169 

0.013) but not with the Campylobacter species (P= 0.099).  

170 

Quinolones and macrolides are the most important antibiotics used for the treatment 

171 

of  human  campylobacteriosis.  Considering  all  the  isolates  studied,  44.7%  (n=  68)  were 

172 

resistant to all quinolones tested (ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, and enrofloxacin), and 13.2% 

173 

(n=20)  were  resistant  to  all  quinolones  and  erythromycin  (Table  3).  The  thermotolerant 

174 

Campylobacter  spp.  isolated  from  carcasses  at  retail  showed  higher  resistance  to  all 

175 

quinolones than those isolated from hens (P= 0.016). The other poultry meat supply stages 

176 

had a frequency of isolates resistant to quinolones (P= 0.187) similar to that found in hens. 

177 

Additionally,  we  found  no  association  between  the  frequency  of  isolates  resistant  to 

178 

quinolones  and  quinolones  +  erythromycin  and  the  Campylobacter  species  (P=  0.326  and 

179 

P= 0.368, respectively).

4. Discussion 

182 

This  study  is  one  of  the  few  reports  on  antibiotic  susceptibility  of  Campylobacter 

183 

spp.  isolated  from  different  stages  of  the  poultry  meat  supply  chain  in  Argentina. 

184 

Campylobacter strains showed high susceptibility to gentamicin. Messad et al. (2014) also 

185 

reported this behavior and proposed that it could be the consequence of the limited use of 

186 

this antibiotic in poultry farms.  

187 

The thermotolerant Campylobacter strains tested in this study showed high resistance 

188 

to  quinolones,  specifically  ciprofloxacin,  nalidixic  acid  and  enrofloxacin.  Similar  results 

189 

have been previously observed in other countries (Messad et al., 2014; Nobile et al., 2013; 

190 

Luber  et  al.,  2003).  The  poultry  reservoir  has  a  fundamental  role  in  the  emergence  of 

191 

quinolone-resistant strains of Campylobacter (Giacomelli et al., 2014). The frequent use of 

192 

sub-therapeutic doses of these antibiotics, either as prophylaxis, therapeutic doses or growth 

193 

promoters in poultry farms, has been proposed as the main reason  for this high resistance 

194 

(Avrain  et  al.,  2003;  Messad  et  al.,  2014).  The  widespread  use  of  antibiotics  in  poultry 

195 

selects for antibiotic-resistant mutants which are able to spread throughout the meat supply 

196 

chain (Desmonts et al., 2004). Australia’s government banned the use of quinolones in food-

197 

producing animals and currently shows a low frequency of Campylobacter strains resistant 

198 

to fluoroquinolones (Wieczorek et al., 2013a). Additionally, it has been reported that flocks 

199 

treated with ionophores (as coccidicidals) had a higher proportion of Campylobacter strains 

200 

resistant to multiple antibiotics such as ampicillin, nalidixic acid, and tetracycline (Avrain et 

201 

al.,  2003).  All  this  suggests  that  the  control  tools  for  thermotolerant  Campylobacter 

202 

multiresistant  to  antibiotics  cannot  be  addressed  only  to  the  restriction  or  prohibition  of 

203 

antimicrobial drugs in animal feed. New production systems and new health tools should be 

9 

 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT204 

designed  to  address  the  public  health  problem  of  thermotolerant  Campylobacter  and 

205 

antimicrobial resistance. 

206 

Many  studies  regarding  the  prevalence  of  antimicrobial-resistant  Campylobacter 

207 

have been performed in  different  countries.  Each of these studies have shown a particular 

208 

pattern of antimicrobial resistance, which may be explained by the variations in the use of 

209 

antibiotic, origin of the samples, isolation techniques, and antimicrobial susceptibility tests 

210 

(Nobile et al., 2013). It is thus difficult to compare the prevalences among countries. In that 

211 

sense, a standard guideline should be developed to establish a global surveillance and thus 

212 

allow monitoring this  food-borne pathogen both  currently  and after the implementation of 

213 

effective control measures to avoid resistance dissemination through the food chain. 

214 

The most remarkable result of our study was the high frequency  of Campylobacter 

215 

strains with multi-drug resistance, especially to the antibiotics considered as first-choice for 

216 

serious Campylobacter infections (ciprofloxacin and erythromycin). The isolation of a high 

217 

proportion of Campylobacter strains resistant to all quinolones and resistant to quinolones + 

218 

erythromycin provides evidence of the key role of raw poultry meat in the exposure risk to 

219 

antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter strains in humans. This situation demands the adoption of 

220 

appropriate risk management measures to control the antibiotic use in food animals (Nobile 

221 

et al., 2013) and in human therapeutic treatment. 

222 

Our  results  indicate  that,  with  the  exception  of  tetracycline,  both  Campylobacter 

223 

species  had  the  same  frequency  of  antibiotic  resistance.  Tetracyclines  are  considered  the 

224 

second-choice  treatment  and  high  resistance  to  this  antimicrobial  may  have  a  negative 

225 

impact  on  public  health.  Many  studies  (e.g.  Nobile  et  al.,  2013;  Luber  et  al.,  2003)  have 

226 

reported the influence of Campylobacter species on the resistance to antibiotics. In general, 

10 

 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT227 

C. coli shows higher resistance than C. jejuni (Giacomelli et al., 2014). Apparently, C. coli 

228 

strains  have  an  intrinsic  ability  to  generate  resistance  against  some  antibiotics  such  as 

229 

erythromycin  (Luber  et  al.,  2003).  Wieczorek  et  al.  (2013b)  found  greater  resistance  to 

230 

antimicrobials for C. coli than for C. jejuni for tetracycline. On the other hand, Nobile et al. 

231 

(2013) found that, in general, C. jejuni shows higher resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, 

232 

and norfloxacin than C. coli.  

233 

In the present work, the Campylobacter strains isolated from the different stages of 

234 

the poultry meat supply chain presented the same frequency of antimicrobial resistance. The 

235 

colonization  of  broilers  with  thermotolerant  Campylobacter  seems  to  be  unavoidable.  The 

236 

high prevalence of these microorganisms was spreading throughout the poultry meat supply 

237 

chain.  In  this  regard,  it  would  be  useful  to  conduct  studies  in  order  to  investigate  the 

238 

genotypic variation among strains of Campylobacter spp. isolated from different stages of 

239 

the  poultry  meat  supply  chain  to  evaluate  whether  the  bacterial  population  was  a  stable 

240 

single genotype or had a mixed and changing profile according with the stage. However, the 

241 

strains isolated from hens showed higher resistance to erythromycin than the strains isolated 

242 

from  the  remaining  stages  of  the  poultry  meat  supply  chain.  On  the  other  hand,  the 

243 

frequency  of  resistance  to  quinolones  (ciprofloxacin  and  enrofloxacin)  was  higher  in  the 

244 

strains isolated from poultry in the farm and from slaughterhouse and retail carcasses than in 

245 

the strains isolated from hens. Four possible explanations might be proposed to clarify this 

246 

finding: a) Both the use of antimicrobials (frequency, dose and type of antimicrobial used) 

247 

and  other  animal  husbandry  practices  are  completely  different  between  hens  and  poultry 

248 

farms.  This  may  impact  on  the  selection  pressure  and  the  emergence  of  Campylobacter 

249 

strains  resistant  to  specific  antibiotics.  This  different  selection  pressure  is  responsible  for 

11 

 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT250 

generating specific clusters of Campylobacter strains at these two stages (hens vs. the rest of 

251 

the stages) of the poultry meat supply chain. Argentina does not have a surveillance system 

252 

on the use of veterinary drugs that allows collecting data on sales of antimicrobial agents. 

253 

This surveillance system dedicated to monitoring drug on species level is needed to assess 

254 

the true levels of antimicrobial use and therefore analyze the possible consequences of their 

255 

use  in  the  emergence  of  antimicrobial-resistant  strains;  b)  hens  have  a  higher  life  than 

256 

poultry and therefore greater potential exposure to antimicrobials applied for prophylactic or 

257 

therapeutic  purposes;  c)  the  biosecurity  measures  adopted  by  the  parent  flocks  are  much 

258 

stricter  than  in  poultry  farms.  Broilers  have  more  possibilities  to  be  in  contact  with  many 

259 

vectors (such as flies, rodents, and wild birds) which have been identified as reservoirs for 

260 

the  transmission  of  antibiotic-resistant  Campylobacter  to  poultry  (Sippy  et  al.,  2012).  In 

261 

addition  to  the  fact  that  the  ecological  conditions  are  different,  the  transmission  of 

262 

Campylobacter spp. from hen farms to poultry farms through eggs is unlikely (Zbrun et al., 

263 

2013); and d) poorly sanitized abiotic surfaces and juices released from avian meat, found in 

264 

slaughterhouse  and  retail  environment,  support  the  biofilms  formation,  which  reintroduce 

265 

planktonic microorganisms resistant to antimicrobials. Additionally, C. jejuni has the ability 

266 

to  form  biofilms  in  the  watering  supplies  and  plumbing  systems  of  animal  husbandry 

267 

facilities and animal-processing plants (Bae et al., 2014; Pearson et al., 1993). 

268 

The horizontal genes transmission has been identified as a relevant mechanism in the 

269 

dissemination  of  antibiotic  resistance  in  Campylobacter  spp.  Mobile  genetic  elements  are 

270 

commonly involved in the horizontal gene transfer, allowing the bacteria to acquire foreign 

271 

DNA  from  the  environment.  C.  jejuni  has  the  ability  to  develops  biofilms  on  different 

272 

abiotic  surfaces  as  a  mechanism  to  survive  in  suboptimal  conditions,  increasing  the 

12 

 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT273 

resistance  to  antimicrobials.  Campylobacter  biofilms  help  to  resist  a  variety  of  stressors 

274 

throughout poultry meat chain supply and appear to be an important reservoir of antibiotic-

275 

resistant C. jejuni under normal growth conditions even without antimicrobial pressure (Bae 

276 

et al., 2014).  

277 

An increase in the presence of antibiotic-resistant strains has also been observed in 

278 

Campylobacter  spp.  isolated  from  human  cases  (WHO,  2014).  This  emphasizes  that  these 

279 

results  reflect  the  behavior  of  Campylobacter  spp.  along  the  poultry  meat  supply  chain 

280 

(Luber et al., 2003). Studies conducted in Argentina testing Campylobacter strains isolated 

281 

from  humans  have  shown  remarkable  resistance  to  ciprofloxacin  (>70%)  and  tetracycline 

282 

(30-40%), but high susceptibility to erythromycin (Tamborini et al., 2012; Fuentes, 2010). 

283 

Antimicrobials  used  massively  in  both  human  medicine  and  veterinary  medicine  can 

284 

generate a high level of resistance (Wieczorek et al., 2013a). 

285 

Although  the  agar  dilution  technique  has  been  classified  as  the  standard  test  for 

286 

Campylobacter (McDermott et al., 2004), here we used the disk diffusion test to investigate 

287 

antimicrobial resistance. Because of its convenience, flexibility, and low cost, disk diffusion 

288 

has been standardized (EUCAST, 2012) and used widely to test rapidly growing pathogens 

289 

such  as  Enterobacteriaceae  and  also  modified  to  test  some  fastidious  organisms  (CLSI, 

290 

2013).  

291 

 

292 

5. Conclusions 

293 

The  finding  of  antibiotic-resistant  (especially  multi-drug  resistant)  Campylobacter 

294 

spp.  reflects  an  alarming  situation  with  potential  serious  consequences  to  the  health  of 

295 

poultry meat consumers. The frequency of antibiotic resistant Campylobacter was variable 

13 

 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT296 

in the different steps of the poultry meat chain supply. The use of antimicrobials in poultry 

297 

farms may generate a selection pressure and lead the emergency of Campylobacter strains 

298 

resistant  against  specific  antibiotics.  It  is  necessary  to  immediately  implement  husbandry 

299 

measures  with  the  aim  to  guide  the  rational  use  of  antibiotics  in  poultry  production. 

300 

Argentina  should  establish  a  surveillance  program  to  investigate  the  prevalence  and 

301 

tendency in prevalence of antibiotic-resistance Campylobacter throughout the poultry meat 

302 

supply chain which may be the scientific basis to establish a risk management policy.
