Abstract

The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  characterise
the  prevalence  of  class  1  integrons  and  gene
cassettes, 
tetracycline-resistance  genes,
phenicol-resistance  genes,  16S  rRNA  methy-
lase  genes,  extended-spectrum  β-lactamase
genes  and  plasmid-mediated  fluoroquinolone
resistance  determinants  in  184  Escherichia
coli isolates from chickens in Anhui Province,
China. Susceptibility to 15 antimicrobials was
determined  using  broth  micro-dilution.
Polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequenc-
ing  were  used  to  characterise  the  molecular
basis of the antibiotic resistance. High rates of
antimicrobial  resistance  were  observed;  131
out of the 184 (72.3%) isolates were resistant
to at least six antimicrobial agents. The preva-
lences of class 1 integrons, tetracycline-resis-
tance  genes,  phenicol-resistance  genes,  16S
rRNA methylase genes, extended-spectrum β-
lactamase genes and plasmid-mediated fluoro-
quinolone resistance determinants were 49.5,
17.4, 15.8, 0.5, 57.6 and 46.2%, respectively. In
82 isolates, 48 different kinds of coexistence of
the different genes were identified. Statistical
2)  analysis showed  that  the  resistance  to
(χ
amoxicillin,  doxycycline,  florfenicol,  ofloxacin
and  gentamicin  had  significant  differences
(P<0.01  or  0.01<P<0.05)  among  the  strains
that  carried  and  did  not  carry  the  resistance
genes,  which  showed  a  certain  correlation
between  antimicrobial resistance  and  the
presence of resistance genes.

Introduction

antimicrobial-resistance 
infections  have
increased  in  the  poultry  industry.  The  emer-
gence of Escherichia coli isolates with multiple
antibiotic-resistance phenotypes has been pre-
viously reported and is regarded as a serious
problem  (Maynard  et  al.,  2003).  Transfer of
resistance determinants by mobile genetic ele-
ments,  including  plasmids,  transposons,  and
gene  cassettes  in  integrons  (Carattoli,  2001;
Hall  and  Collins, 1995)  are  important  factors
that  contribute  to  the  increase  in  antibiotic
resistance  in  multiple-resistant  E.  coli.  In  a
previous study (Saénz et al., 2004), 17 multiple
antimicrobial-resistance nonpathogenic E. coli
strains  of  human,  animal,  and  food  origins
showed a wide variety of antibiotic resistance
genes,  many  of  them  carried  by  class  1  and
class  2  integrons.  The  main  purpose  of  the
present  study  was  to  investigate  the  preva-
lence and characteristics of class 1 integrons,
tetracycline-resistant  genes,  phenicol-resis-
tant  genes,  16S  rRNA  methylase  genes,
extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) genes
and  plasmid-mediated  fluoroquinolone  resist-
ance (PMQR) genes and their coexistence in
184  E.  coli isolates  collected  from  chicken

farms.Materials and methods
Bacterial isolates 

In this study, E. coli isolates (n=184) were
collected from chicken cloacae at four different
farms located in Anhui Province, China, from
March to May 2012. The data and location of
each farm are as follows: No. 1 chicken farm
(n=46,  located  in  Hefei  city),  No.  2  chicken
farm (n=44, located in Changfeng county), No.
3 chicken farm (n=44, located in Feixi county),
and  No.  4  chicken  farm  (n=50,  located  in
Feidong  county).  Sterile  cotton  swabs  were
used  to  collect  fecal  samples  from  chicken
cloacae.  The  swabs  were  immediately  trans-
ferred to sterile collection containers contain-
ing  Luria-Bertani  (LB)  broth  and  were  cul-
tured  at  37°C  overnight.  The  cultures  were
inoculated in E.coli Chromogenic Medium and
were grown at 37°C for 18-24 h. Then picked
up a single colony which was routinely grown
in LB or LB agar at 37°C for 18-24 h.

(SAR),  sulfamonomethoxine  (SUL)]  were
determined  using  the  broth  micro-dilution
method, according to the guidelines issued by
the  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards
Institute. E. coli ATCC 25922 was used as the
reference strain.

Genotypic resistance characterisa-
tion 

Class 1 integrons and gene cassettes, tetra-
cycline-resistance  genes  (tetA and  tetM),
phenicol-resistance genes (floR and fexA), 16S
rRNA methylase genes (armA and rmtB), ESBL
genes (blaCTX-M, blaTEM and blaSHV) and PMQR
genes (qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrD, qnrS, aac(6’)-
Ib-cr and  qepA)  were  detected  by  PCR  using
the primers listed in Table 1. All the PCR ampli-
cons were confirmed by dideoxy DNA sequenc-
ing.  The  DNA  sequences  obtained  were  com-
pared with those in GenBank using the BLAST
program (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

Results
Antimicrobial susceptibility of
Escherichia coli isolates

High  rates  of  resistance  to  OTC  (97.8%),
SUL (97.3%), DC (90.2%), AMX (82.6%), LOM
(77.7%),  CRO  (70.1%),  OFX  (67.4%),  ERO
(55.9%),  and  FFC  (52.7%)  were  observed
among  the  184  E.  coli isolates.  Low  rates  of
resistance to AMI (7.6%) and SAR (2.2%) were
observed.  The  resistance  rates  of  E.  coli iso-
lates from four chicken farms to 15 antimicro-
bials can be seen in Figure 1. One hundred and
thirty-one (72.3%) of the isolates were resist-
ant to at least six antimicrobial agents, while
25  (13.6%)  were  resistant  to  at  least  10  of
these drugs (Figure 2).

Detection of the six categories of
resistance determinants

The  PCR  results  showed  that  91  (49.5%)
strains harbored class 1 integrons. Seventy of
the 91 intl-positive isolates carried gene cas-
settes,  which  were  dfrA1-tnpAIS26-aadA1
(45/70), dfrA2-aadA12 (16/70) and dfrA1-aadA1
(9/70); 21 isolates did not carry gene cassettes. 
Tetracycline-resistance genes were detected
in 32 of 184 (17.4%) isolates (tetA, n=27; tetM,
n=5). Twenty-nine (15.8%) isolates possessed
phenicol-resistance  genes  (floR,  n=29);  no
fexA genes were detected. Only one isolate car-
ried a 16S rRNA methylase gene in the form of
rmtB; no isolates were positive for armA. 

ESBL genes were detected in 106 of the 184
(57.6%)  isolates  (blaCTX-M,  n=40;  blaTEM-1,

n=49; and blaTEM-206, n=17); no isolates were
positive for the blaSHV gene. Eighty-five out of
the  184  (46.2%)  isolates  possessed  PMQR
determinants.  Twenty-two  (11.9%)  isolates
carried  the  qnr determinant  and  63  (34.2%)
carried aac(6’)-Ib-cr. Among the qnr determi-
nants,  only  the  qnrS-type  gene  was  detected;
no isolates were positive for qnrA, qnrB, qnrC,
qnrD or qepA genes.

Coexistence of different resistance
genes 

Coexistence  of  different  resistance  genes
was  identified  in  82  E.  coli isolates.  There
were  48  different  kinds  of  coexistence  of
resistance genes (Table 2). Twenty-six isolates
carried three different genes, five isolates car-
ried  four  genes  and  three  carried  five  genes.
Only  one  isolate  harbored  six  genes,  which
were  dfrA2-aadA12, tetA, tetM, blaTEM-1, qnrS
and aac(6’)-Ib-cr.  The  combination  of  dfrA1-
aac(6’)-Ib-cr  was
tnpAIS26-aadA1
observed in eight E. coli isolates. 

Relationship between resistance
genes and antibiotic resistance of
the 184Escherichia coli isolates

and 

A χ

2 test was used to determine the relation-
ship between resistance genes and antimicro-
bial resistance  of  the  184  E.  coli  isolates.

Compared  the  resistance  to  AMX,  DC,  FFC,
OFX  and  GEN,  the  results  of  strains  carrying
resistance  genes  were  significantly  different
(P<0.01 or 0.01<P<0.05) from the strains not
carrying resistance genes, while resistance to
the  remaining  10  antimicrobials  showed  no
difference (P>0.05) (Table 3).

Discussion 

No information is available about the occur-
rence and distribution of the different resist-
ance  determinants,  such  as  integrons  and
gene  cassettes,  tetracycline-resistance  genes,
phenicol-resistance  genes,  16S  rRNA  methy-
lase genes, ESBL and PMQR genes in  E.  coli
from  chickens  in  Anhui  Province,  China,
therefore we screened 184 E. coli isolates for
the presence of these resistance determinants.
71.2% of the isolates were resistance to at least
six  antimicrobial  agents,  while  13.6%  were
resistance to at least 10 of these drugs, indicat-
ing  a  high  prevalence  of  multiple  antibiotic-
resistance  E.  coli
in  chickens  in  Anhui
Province. In Henan Province, the proportion of
multiple antibiotic resistance isolates in chick-
ens  was  76.5%  (Yuan  et  al.,  2010).  In
Shanghai,  56.9%  E.  coli  isolates  were  resist-

ance  to  10  to  15  antimicrobial  agents  (Ma  et
al.,  2009).  Additionally,  95.1%  E.  coli  isolates
from different regions showed multiple antibi-
otic  resistance  (Lin  et  al.,  2009).  The  differ-
ences  in  multiple  antibiotic  resistance  could
be caused by different antimicrobial usage in
these areas. 

In  this  study,  184  E.  coli

isolates  were
assayed for the presence of class 1 integrons.
49.5% of isolates carried class 1 integrons, har-
bouring gene  cassettes  such  as  dfrA1-tnpA
IS26-aadA1, dfrA2-aadA12 and  dfrA1-aadA1,
which encode resistance to sulfonamides and
aminoglycosides. There are differences in the
prevalence  of  the  class  1  integrons  in  China
and abroad. 52% of E. coli isolated from poultry
food possessed class 1 integrons (Soufi et al.,
2011) in Tunisia. In Spain, a study suggested
that  the  frequency  of  class  1  integrons  was
51%  (Marchant  et  al.,  2013).  In  China,  one
study  showed  that  60.4%  of  E.  coli  isolates
from chickens had class 1 integrons (Zhang et
al., 2009). In addition, 89.9% E. coli collected
from food-producing animals were positive for
class 1 (Lin et al., 2011). In this study, the fre-
quency  of  class  1  integrons  is  similar  to  the
data  obtained  abroad,  but  lower  than  the
domestic data. 

In  addition,  we  detected  tetracycline-resis-

16S  rRNA  methylase  genes.  The  results
showed  that  in  Anhui  Province,  the  frequen-
cies of tetA, tetM, and floR were 14.7, 2.7 and
15.8%, respectively. Only one isolate harbored
a  16S  rRNA  methylase  gene  (rmtB).  No  iso-
lates carried fexA and armA. In other studies,
the frequencies of tetA and tetM were 87.9 and
15.5%,  respectively  (Zhang  et  al.,  2010),  the
prevalence of floR was 45.1% (Du et al., 2007)
and the frequency of rmtB was 30.3% (Zhou et
al., 2010). Thus the frequencies of these three
genes  in  the  current  study  were  lower  than
those reported previously. 

The blaTEM-1 gene was the most common β-
lactamase  gene  among  E.  coli
isolates  in
Anhui  Province.  This  was  in  agreement  with
previous  findings  (Xia  et  al.,  2010).  With
respect to PMQR genes, qnrS and aac(6’)-Ib-cr
were  predominant,  while  other  PMQR  genes
were not detected in this study. 

Notably,  82  isolates  carried  more  than  two
types of genes, resulting in 48 different kinds
of  coexistence  of  class  1  integrons  and  gene
cassettes, 
tetracycline-resistance  genes,
phenicol-resistance  genes,  ESBL  and  PMQR
genes.  Thus  the  coexistence  of  resistance
genes was very common and varied in Anhui
Province. The most frequent coexistence was
dfrA1-tnpAIS26-aadA1 and aac(6’)-Ib-cr, which
was found in eight  E.  coli isolates, while the
others were found in ≤ four isolates. Six deter-
minants,  dfrA2-aadA12,
tetM, blaTEM-1,
qnrS  and aac(6’)-Ib-cr,  were  detected  in  an
individual  E.  coli isolate.  To  the  best  of  our
knowledge, this is the first report of these six
genes coexisting in an E. coli strain in China.
In addition, statistical analysis indicated a cor-

tetA,

relation between antimicrobial resistance and
the  presence  of  resistance  genes.  Except  for
CQN, the frequency of resistance to the other
14 antimicrobial agents in those isolates that
carried  resistance  genes  was  higher  than
those without resistance genes. This was espe-
cially the case for resistance to AMX, DC, FFC,
OFX and GEN (P<0.01 or 0.01<P<0.05), which
suggested that the prevalence of ESBL genes,
tetracycline-resistance  genes,  phenicol-resis-
tance genes, PMQR genes and aadA was relat-
ed, to a certain extent, to the observed resist-
ance to AMX, DC, FFC, OFX and GEN.

Conclusions

In conclusion, this is the first study describ-
ing the  prevalence  and  characteristics  of  six
categories  of  resistance  determinants  in  E.
coli isolates from chickens in Anhui Province,
China.  The  most  abundant  genes  were  ESBL
genes (57.6%), class 1 integrons (49.5%) and
PMQR genes (46.2%). In 82 isolates, 48 differ-
ent types of coexistence of the different genes
were identified. Six genes, dfrA2-aadA12, tetA,
tetM, blaTEM-1, qnrS  and aac(6’)-Ib-cr,  were
detected in an individual E. coli isolate for the
first  time.  Resistance  to  AMX,  DC,  FFC,  OFX
and GEN was significantly different (P<0.01 or
0.01<P<0.05)  among  the  strains  that  carried
and did not carry resistance genes, which indi-
cated that resistance genes contributed to the
corresponding antimicrobial resistance.
