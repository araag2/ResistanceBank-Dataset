ABSTRACT

Cheesemaking is one of the most important industries in Mexico. Among all the Mexican cheeses, fresh cheeses are the most
popular and most consumed cheese in Mexico and Latin America. However, in Mexico fresh cheese is frequently made with
unpasteurized milk and sold in public markets. This may increase the risk for contamination of dairy products with pathogenic
bacteria. The presence of multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria in food is an important public health concern. Diarrheagenic
Escherichia coli pathotypes (DEPs) are foodborne bacteria. This study investigated the presence of indicator bacteria and
multidrug-resistant DEPs in fresh cheeses. A total of 120 fresh cheese samples were collected from public markets in the city of
Pachuca, Mexico. The samples were analyzed for presence of fecal coliforms (FC), E. coli, and antibiotic resistant DEPs. FC and
E. coli were analyzed using the most-probable-number technique. DEPs were identiﬁed using two multiplex PCR methods.
Susceptibility to 16 antibiotics was tested for the isolated DEPs strains by the standard assay. The frequency of FC, E. coli, and
DEPs in the cheese samples was 50, 40, and 19%, respectively. The identiﬁed DEPs included Shiga toxin–producing E. coli
(STEC; 8%), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC; 6%), and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC; 5%). All isolated strains exhibited
resistance to at least ﬁve antibiotics. One, one, two, and three STEC strains were resistant to 14, 12, 11, and 10 antibiotics,
respectively. One strain of EPEC was resistant to 11 antibiotics, three EPEC strains to 9, and one strain to 7. One, one, and two
strains of ETEC were resistant to 10, 8, and 7 antibiotics, respectively. The results of the present study indicate that fresh cheeses
made with unpasteurized milk could be a risk for consumers, both for native people and visitors to Mexico.

Fresh cheeses such as panela and adobera are made from
whole or low-fat cow’s milk curd via casein coagulation with
rennet, in many cases without thermal treatment (35). These
cheeses have a high moisture content, a light ﬂavor, no rind,
and a short shelf life, and they require refrigeration (36). The
fresh cheeses are produced in coagulation vats using enzymes
and/or acids. Once curdled, the whey is drained off; the large
cheese clumps are removed, milled into curds, and salted; and
the ﬁnished cheese is packed in plastic bags for sale (16). In
Mexico, different types of fresh cheeses are made, including
panela, fresco, ranchero, Oaxaca, asadero, mozzarella, morral,
adobera, cottage, and cream (45). However, panela and

adobera are the types most widely sold in the Mexican
market.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations (FAO), for the period 2015 to 2024,
Mexico will maintain 11th place in dairy production,
producing approximately 13,021,600 L of milk per year
for every 1,000 head of dairy cows. Cow’s milk is used to
make diverse dairy derivatives, with approximately 17%
used for artisan products like sweets and cheeses (28, 45). In
the State of Hidalgo, Mexico, milk production amounts to
411.1 million L per year; this is marketed as unpasteurized
milk or is used for industrial and artisanal production of
cheeses. Nonetheless, approximately 56% of milk produc-
tion is used for the production of fresh handmade cheese.
Many fresh cheese producers in Mexico use unpasteurized
raw milk because they believe that the native microbiota of

PRESENCE OF MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT E. COLI PATHOTYPES ON CHEESES

Indeed,

raw milk confers pleasant aromas and ﬂavors to the ﬁnal
product. In addition, a signiﬁcant proportion of consumers
also prefer fresh cheeses made with raw milk (45). However,
dairy products made from unpasteurized milk represent a
risk to public health due to their pathogenic bacteria content
(41).
there are reports of disease outbreaks
associated with consumption of fresh Mexican-style cheeses
made with unpasteurized milk (13, 33). Most of these
outbreaks have been associated with Listeria monocytogenes
(33), Salmonella (13), and Brucella (1). Escherichia coli
O157:H7 is not common in dairy products but has been
responsible for outbreaks of diseases caused by consumption
of cheese made from unpasteurized milk (16). There are no
reports of disease outbreaks by E. coli pathotypes other than
the E. coli O157:H7 serotype associated with consumption
of fresh cheeses from unpasteurized milk.

(EIEC), enteroaggregative E. coli

However, a recent outbreak of entero-aggregative-
hemorrhagic E. coli
in several European countries (6)
highlights the importance of detecting diarrheagenic E. coli
pathotypes (DEPs) in various raw foods, such as fresh
cheeses made from unpasteurized milk. DEPs are classiﬁed
based on their virulence traits: enterotoxigenic E. coli
(ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enteroinvasive E.
coli
(EAEC), diffuse
adherent E. coli (DAEC), Shiga toxin–producing E. coli
(STEC), and entero-aggregative-hemorrhagic E. coli (EA-
HEC). The STEC pathotype includes E. coli O157:H7;
serogroups other than O157 are known as non-O157 STEC.
DEPs are the major cause of diarrhea in developed countries
and in visitors from regions where DEPs are not endemic
(18, 19, 39). In Mexico, DEPs have been associated with
diarrheal diseases both in native children (18) and visitors to
Mexico (43).

In addition to this problem, the emergence of antibiotic-
resistant pathogenic bacteria in food has recently been
reported, which represents an additional public health
concern. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic
bacteria is associated with the use of antibiotics in animals
raised for milk and meat production. Resistant bacteria can
be transmitted to humans through foods, particularly those
of animal origin such as fresh cheeses made from
unpasteurized milk (20).

No data exist on the presence of multidrug-resistant
DEPs in fresh cheeses sold in Mexico. The objective of this
study was to quantify the presence of fecal coliforms (FC),
E. coli, and multidrug-resistant STEC, EPEC, ETEC, EIEC,
and EAEC in fresh cheeses from public markets in Mexico.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Fresh cheese samples. A total of 120 cheese samples were
collected over a 5-month study period. Cheese samples were
purchased from six dairy retailers in each of three public markets
(18 retailers). The public markets of Pachuca sampled were
Primero de Mayo, Benito Jua´rez, and the Central de Abastos.
Samples were purchased every 3 weeks from each retailer,
resulting in 18 samples per day. Each fresh cheese sample was a
single circular unit weighing approximately 500 g. At the time of
purchase, the cheeses were in their original packaging under
refrigeration. Samples were placed in sterile plastic bags and
then in a refrigerated container containing frozen gel bags for

transport to the laboratory. They were analyzed within 2 h after
purchase.

Sample preparation. In the laboratory, each fresh cheese
sample (500 g) was placed in a sterile plastic bag and then
manually rubbed for 2 min to powder and homogenize the sample.
Afterward, 100 g of powdered cheese sample (subsample) was
added to a sterile plastic bag and 900 mL of sterilized peptone
water (0.1%; Bioxon, Mexico City, Mexico) was added to the bag.
The subsample was manually rubbed for 2 min while in the sealed
bag. Decimal dilutions were prepared using the above diluent. The
samples were analyzed to detect the presence of FC and E. coli,
according to U.S. Food and Drug Administration Bacteriological
Analytical Manual (BAM) (50), and to detect STEC, EPEC,
ETEC, EIEC, EAEC, and EHEC, exactly as previously described
(23).

Microbiological analysis. Quantiﬁcation of FC and E. coli
was performed by the most-probable-number (MPN) technique
exactly as described in BAM (50). Brieﬂy, from the homogenized
sample, decimal dilutions were performed in 0.1% sterilized
peptone water, and dilutions were inoculated into tubes containing
lactose broth (Bioxon) and Durham tubes. After incubation at 378C
for 48 h,
lactose broth tubes with bacterial growth and gas
production were transferred to tubes containing 2% brilliant green
bile lactose broth (Bioxon). After incubation at 44.5 6 28C for 48
h, the tubes that were positive for growth and gas production were
considered positive for FC. The quantiﬁcation of FC was
performed using the MPN tables (50). The value obtained was
expressed as MPN of FC per gram. Tubes that were positive for FC
were used to identify indole formation (50). All tubes that were
positive for indole and gas production were streaked onto eosin
methylene blue (Bioxon) agar. Two to three presumptive E. coli
colonies were selected from eosin methylene blue plates and
biochemically characterized by the indole, methyl red, Voges-
Proskauer, and citrate test (Bioxon). Biochemical conﬁrmation of
presumptive E. coli
isolates was done with the API 20E test
(bioM´erieux, Hazelwood, MO). Conﬁrmation of a single colony
such as E. coli is known to be sufﬁcient to consider that the
respective MPN tube is positive for E. coli. The concentration of E.
coli was calculated using the MPN tables (50). All conﬁrmed E.
coli strains were streaked on tryptic soy agar slant tubes, incubated
at 378C for 24 h, and maintained at 3 to 58C until they were used
for PCRs.

Multiplex PCRs for DEP locus identiﬁcation. All E. coli
strains isolated and conﬁrmed by biochemical tests were analyzed
using two multiplex PCRs to identify several genetic loci
associated with diarrheagenic E. coli, exactly as previously
described (23). Brieﬂy,
the ﬁrst multiplex PCR identiﬁes the
following loci: heat-stable and heat-labile enterotoxins (ST and
LT) for ETEC, intimin (eaeA) bundle-forming pilus for EPEC,
Shiga toxins 1 and 2 (stx1, stx2) and intimin (eaeA) for STEC, and
invasion-associated loci for EIEC. The second multiplex PCR
identiﬁes three EAEC plasmid-borne virulence genes, including
the master regulon (aggR), dispersin (aap), and the autotransporter
Tol C (aatA). STEC isolates were further characterized by the
expression of O157 lipopolysaccharide and H7 ﬂagellar antigens,
using only the E. coli O157:H7 latex agglutination test kit (RIM E.
coli O157:H7 latex assay kit, Remel, Lenexa, KS). The MPN for
STEC, EPEC, and ETEC was calculated following the MPN
method as described above (50).

Antibiotic susceptibility testing. All DEP isolates were
screened for antibiotic sensitivity to 16 different antibiotics using a
disk diffusion test as described by the Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (12). The strains isolated from the cheese
samples were cultivated in tryptic soy broth at 358C for 24 h. For
each, dilutions were made in peptone diluent and were plated on
Mueller-Hinton agar using the surface extension technique.
Afterward, paper disks containing the following antibiotics were
placed at speciﬁc concentrations (all lg/mL): amikacin (30),
amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (20/10), ampicillin (10), ceftriaxone
(30), chloramphenicol
(30), ciproﬂoxacin (5), colistin (10),
erythromycin (15), gentamicin (10), kanamycin (30), nalidixic
acid (30), neomycin (10), streptomycin (10), sulﬁsoxazole (250),
tetracycline (30), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (1.25/23.75).
The petri dishes were incubated at 358C for 24 h, and then the
diameter of the inhibition zone formed was measured (12).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Fifty percent of the samples presented evidence of poor
hygiene practices. The frequency of FC, E. coli, and DEPs
was 50, 40, and 19%, respectively (Table 1). The FC values
ranged from ,3.0 to 1,100 MPN/g. However, median
values indicate that, although some samples had elevated
levels of FC, most samples had low values. The FC
frequency was lower than the values reported in a study of
cheeses from markets located in Sao Paolo, Brazil, which
found 93% of samples positive (4); similarly, Ara ´ujo et al.
(3) reported FC in 82.2% of cheese samples from markets in
the City of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. However, Trmˇci´c et al.
(49) analyzed 273 cheese samples from markets located in
New York and found FC in 55.3% of the samples.

On the other hand, in general, the concentrations of E.
coli found in the cheese samples were lower than those
reported by Guzma´n et al. (24), who obtained values greater
than 1,100 MPN/g in samples of fresh cheeses from the
municipal markets of the State of Tabasco, Mexico.

In the present study, a total of 420 E. coli colonies were
isolated from the 120 cheese samples. This is because a
colony of E. coli was isolated from each tube positive for E.
coli obtained by the MPN procedure. All 420 E. coli
colonies were analyzed by PCR, and 125 colonies were
identiﬁed as DEPs. These results were used to calculate the
MPN of STEC, EPEC, and ETEC as described in ‘‘Materials
and Methods.’’ Note that all DEP colonies isolated from the
same cheese sample by the MPN procedure were considered
as only one DEP strain. Thus, 23 DEP strains were isolated
from all 120 cheese samples.

The identiﬁed DEPs included STEC (8%), EPEC (6%),
and ETEC (5%) (Table 2). Note that neither EIEC nor
EAEC were detected in any cheese sample. In the positive
samples,
the concentration of DEPs ranged from 3.6 to
1,100 MPN/g (Table 2).

No E. coli O157: H7 was detected in any STEC-
positive sample. This result agrees with previous reports in
which the serotype O157:H7 was not detected in any STEC-
positive food samples in Mexico (11, 21–23, 48). Ruminant
animals, especially cattle, are a primary reservoir of E. coli
O157:H7 and other EHEC pathogens (16, 39, 47). Many
human E. coli O157:H7 outbreaks have been linked to food
products derived from animals (such as cheeses) or to
contact with ruminant animals or their wastes. However, it
has been reported that the prevalence of E. coli O157 in
cattle and humans in Mexico is lower (8, 40) than that
reported in the United States. Because E. coli O157
outbreaks related with food products derived from animals
and cattle carriage of E. coli O157 are closely linked (10,
16), it appears that the low presence of E. coli O157 in food
in Mexico might be related to the lower prevalence of E. coli
O157 in Mexican cattle.

The ETEC frequency obtained in the present study is
similar to that reported by Jaafar et al. (31), who obtained
ETEC strains from 8.33% of 60 cheese samples collected
from different locations in Baghdad, Iraq. Similarly, for
STEC, the values obtained were similar to those reported by
Elhadidy and Mohammed (17), who found that 7% of
samples of cheese made from raw milk in Mansoura, Egypt,
were positive. However,
the EPEC frequencies obtained
were lower than those reported by Najand and Ghanbarpour
(38), who identiﬁed EPEC in 19.84% of Iranian soft cheese
samples.

As for the identiﬁed locus, the stx2 locus was detected in
four strains and the stx1 locus in six strains of STEC (Table
2). stx1 and stx2 were not simultaneously detected in any
strain. This result agrees with previous reports in which the
stx2 locus was present at lower rates than the stx1 locus in
STEC strains isolated from different foods in Mexico (11,
21–23, 48). Other researchers have also reported a higher
prevalence of stx1 than stx2 in non-O157 and O157 STEC
strains isolated from patients and food (26).

STEC strains are human pathogens associated with
foodborne diseases; some may cause hemorrhagic colitis,
which in some cases may progress to hemolytic-uremic
syndrome (HUS) (39). Ruminants, mainly dairy cattle, are
the predominant reservoir of STEC (10). The pathogenesis
of STEC is associated with different virulence factors such
as Shiga toxins (stx1 and stx2) (39). stx1 and stx2 strains have
been reported to cause different degrees and types of tissue
damage (34); stx2 is more toxic than stx1 for human renal
endothelial cells (34). Also, Orth et al. (42) have mentioned
that stx2 strains are associated with high virulence and the
ability to cause HUS, whereas stx1 strains are associated
with a milder course of the disease (non-HUS). Other major
virulence determinants in STEC include the locus of the
gene encoding the outer membrane adhesin, intimin (eae),
mediating a close contact between STEC or EPEC with
intestinal epithelial cells (30). However, some strains of
eaeA-negative STEC can cause HUS and occasional

outbreaks (44, 50). It has been postulated that these strains
of eaeA-negative STECs have other putative factors
associated with adherence and virulence (14, 44).

EPEC strains have been responsible for outbreaks of
diarrhea in both developed and developing countries (19,
39). EPEC strains have been isolated from various animal
species, such as bovine, goats, sheep, chickens, pigeons, and
seagulls (15). Typical EPEC strains contain both the eaeA
and bundle-forming pilus locus, whereas atypical EPEC
strains contain only eaeA (27). Unlike typical EPEC strains
found only in humans, atypical strains of EPEC from
different animal species have been isolated (15).

ETEC represents another major cause of diarrhea for
those who live in developing countries and for visitors from
regions where ETEC is not endemic (traveler’s diarrhea)
(39). ETECs are of human origin and,
therefore, are
indicators of fecal contamination. However, ETEC has been
isolated from pigs and cattle (37). ETEC is usually
transmitted by contaminated food. The ETEC pathotype
has been isolated in Mexico from jalape ˜no and serrano
peppers (11) and carrot juice (48).

Although in general

the minimum infective dose
estimated for these three DEPs is high (106 to 108 cells),
the three DEPs found in the cheeses analyzed were at
concentrations that should be considered as a potential risk

for the consumer. The concentration is reported per gram, so
if a person consumes 100 g of cheese, their exposure is
increased 100 times.

Many countries have implemented new hygiene rules
and safety systems to reduce the health risks associated with
cheese consumption, owing to the high number of outbreaks
that have occurred and the severity of infections caused by
the pathogens involved in such outbreaks. An additional
safety concern is the resistance of pathogenic bacteria to
antibiotics, which increases the risk and severity of the
disease (7).

All DEP strains isolated from the cheese samples
showed resistance to at least ﬁve antibiotics: amoxicillin–
clavulanic acid, amikacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, and
colistin (Table 2). One, one, two, and three STEC strains
were resistant to 14, 12, 11, and 10 antibiotics, respectively.
One strain of EPEC was resistant to 11 antibiotics, another
three EPEC strains to 9, and one strain to 7. One, one, and
two ETEC strains were resistant to 10, 8, and 7 antibiotics,
(5)
respectively (Table 2). Similarly, Bonyadian et al.
reported percentages of resistance of 30, 36, 23.4, and
4.25%, respectively, for gentamicin, nalidixic acid, ampi-
cillin, and streptomycin in strains of EAEC isolated from
artisanal cheeses from dairy farms in Iran. On the other
hand, Miranda et al. (35) reported similar results for strains

of E. coli
isolated from Arz ´ua-Ulloa organic cheeses
obtained from markets in Spain; they observed a resistance
to ampicillin, streptomycin, ciproﬂoxacin, and gentamicin in
37, 25, 8, and 4% of E. coli strains, respectively.

Hassan and Elmalt (25) isolated strains of ETEC from
47.8% of Egyptian cheese samples. Antibiotic resistance
was observed to nalidixic acid (42.9%), ampicillin (32.7%),
tetracycline (22.4%),
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
(14.3%), ciproﬂoxacin (4.1%), and cefoxitin (2%). Also,
the present study agrees with previous reports that showed
antibiotics to have limited efﬁcacy against strains of DEPs
isolated from different sources, such as dairy products,
vegetables, meats, ﬁsh and shellﬁsh, and human feces (9, 18,
47). However,
in the present study, most of the strains
isolated were sensitive to chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone,
whereas all strains were resistant to amoxicillin–clavulanic
acid, amikacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, and colistin.
These results also coincide with a study in which strains
of DEPs isolated from different foods, including vegetables,
were sensitive to chloramphenicol and nalidixic acid (9).
Also, strains of E. coli O157:H7 resistant to chloramphen-
icol have been isolated from raw milk of cattle, goats, and
sheep in Greece (47).

The recent emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria
may be due to abuse in the use of various antibiotics at
veterinary and human levels. At the veterinary level, they are
often used as growth factors; they are also used to control
various bacterial infections in humans and animals (2, 51).
Note that owing to the abuse of antibiotics in cattle, these
could be present in meat or milk, e.g., Ibarra et al. (29)
reported the presence of sulphonamides in milk samples.

In Mexico, there are no previous reports of the presence
of DEPs resistant to antibiotics in cheeses. However, the
presence of multidrug-resistant DEPs has been reported in
other foods (21, 22). The presence of STEC and uropatho-
genic E. coli
in fresh artisanal cheeses made with
unpasteurized milk has also been reported in Tabasco state,
Mexico (24).

Note that all antibiotics tested in this study are used in
human medicine. In fact, most of these antibiotics are
considered ‘‘critically important’’ or ‘‘very important’’ for
human medicine by the World Health Organization (51);
thus, their use should be restricted. However, almost all
types of antibiotics available to humans have also been used
in animal production (2, 51), and resistance to antibiotics has
been increasingly identiﬁed in pathogenic bacteria of
animals (32). Evidence from around the world has increased
in recent years, that the use of antibiotics in agriculture is an
important factor that conditions the resistance of bacteria to
antibiotics (46). However, although animal products are
considered to be the main foods containing such antibiotic-
resistant bacteria and genes, contamination occurring during
the preparation, handling, and processing of fresh food of
both animal and plant origin is becoming a concern.

Like other raw foods, cheeses made from unpasteurized
milk are potential vehicles for pathogens such as multidrug-
resistant strains of DEPs. In the production of fresh cheeses,
multiple sources of contamination with pathogenic micro-
organisms may occur during the collection and transport of
milk, and also during the processing, packaging, distribu-

tion, and marketing of cheeses. Once incorporated into food
preparation, cheeses made from unpasteurized milk can be
sources of cross-contamination. In addition, the personal
hygiene of the food handler is also an important factor of
contamination.

The results of the present study indicate that fresh
cheeses made with unpasteurized milk could be a risk for the
consumers in the Hidalgo state and for neighboring states.
Also,
the prevention and control of health risks by
multidrug-resistant DEP strains require the incorporation
and consistent application of good milking and manufactur-
ing practices throughout the milk production process and
during the production of the cheese, until its sale. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report in the literature on
the presence of multidrug-resistant STEC, EPEC, and ETEC
strains in fresh cheeses sold in Mexico.
