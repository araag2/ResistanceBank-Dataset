Abstract 
Background:  Staphylococcus species cause mastitis and wound infection in livestock and food poisoning in humans 
through ingestion of contaminated foods, including meat and dairy products. They are evolving pathogens in that 
they readily acquire drug resistance, and multiple drug-resistant (MDR) isolates are increasing in human and veterinary 
healthcare. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of Staphylococci and their drug resistance 
in dairy farms and abattoir settings of Addis Ababa.
Methods:  In this cross-sectional study, 193 samples of milk, meat, equipment and humans working in the dairy farms 
and abattoir were collected (dairy farms = 72 and abattoir sources = 121). Staphylococcus isolation and identification 
at the species level was done according to ISO-6888-3 using biochemical characteristics. An antimicrobial susceptibil-
ity test was conducted for 43 of the isolates using 15 antimicrobial agents commonly used for humans and livestock 
by the Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method following CLSI guidelines.
Results:  Staphylococcus organism were isolated from 92 (47.7%) of the total 193 samples, 50% in the dairy farms 
and 46.3% in the abattoir. The isolated species were S. aureus (n = 31; 16.1%), S. intermedius (n = 21; 10.9%), S. hyicus 
(n = 16; 8.3%), and coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CNS) (n = 24; 12.4%). Gentamycin was effective drug as all 
isolates (n = 43; 100%) were susceptible to it and followed by kanamycin (n = 39; 90.7%). However, the majority of 
the isolates showed resistance to penicillin-G (95.3%), nalidixic acid (88.4%), cloxacillin (79.1%), vancomycin (65.1%) 
and cefoxitin (55.8%). Of the 15 S. aureus tested for drug susceptibility, 73.3% of them were phenotypically resistant to 
vancomycin (VRSA) and all of the 15 isolates showed multi-drug resistance (MDR) to >3 drugs. Also, all of the tested 
CNS (100%), S. hyicus (100%) and the majority of S. intermedius isolates (88.9%) developed MDR.
Conclusion:  Alarmingly, the Staphylococcus isolates circulating in the dairy farms and abattoir in the study area 
harbor MDR. High level of Staphylococcus species isolation from personnel and equipment besides food (meat and 
milk) samples in dairy farms and abattoir settings reveals that the hygiene practice in the dairy farm and abattoir is 
substandard. Prudent drug use and improved hygienic practice is recommended in the dairy farms and abattoir to 
safeguard the public from the risk of acquiring infections and MDR pathogenic Staphylococcus.

Background
The  genus  Staphylococcus  comprises  of  several  species 
and  subspecies  [1].  The  genus  is  broadly  grouped  into 
two, namely, coagulase- positive and coagulase-negative 
Staphylococcus (CNS) [2, 3]. CNS consists of a group of 
various  Staphylococcus  species  that  affect  diverse  host 
ranges. Some of them have evolved to cause mastitis in 
farm animals [4] whilst some species colonize post-sur-
gical  wounds  (or  cause  infections  in  immunocompro-
mised people) in humans [3]. Of the coagulase-positive 
Staphylococci group, the three major pathogenic ones are 
S. aureus, S. intermedius and S. hyicus [5, 6]. These three 
species  are  associated  in  many  diverse  and  specialized 
forms with healthy and diseased farm animals and most 
of  common  pet  animals  [5].  They  are  the  major  patho-
gen causing mastitis although have tropism to different 
body  parts  of  various  hosts  [5,  7,  8].  They  are  versatile 
pathogens  with  the  ability  to  transfer  between  humans 
and livestock [6, 9, 10]. In human, they cause mild skin 
infection to more severe diseases such as pneumonia and 
septicemia [11]. In animals, their frequent involvement in 
mastitis results in contamination of milk and dairy prod-
ucts. They may found in a variety of locations in the dairy 
farms, abattoirs, food-processing units and on the body 
parts of the animals [12]. Staphylococci are also respon-
sible for contamination of food products, food spoilage, 
reduction  of  food  safety  and  shelf  life  and  cause  food-
borne  poisoning  via  production  of  deadly  enterotoxins 
[13–17]. Infected individuals are the source of Staphylo-
cocci  food  contamination  and  intoxication  at  any  point 
along the food chain [18]. Staphylococcal food poisoning 
has been reported as third cause of food-borne illnesses 
in the world [19].

Food  is  also  an  important  vehicle  for  the  transfer  of 
antimicrobial resistant (AMR) factor to intestinal tract of 
consumers very efficiently [20, 21]. AMR has become the 
main public health burden worldwide [22]. Further trans-
fer of AMR bacteria to humans via the food chain [23] 
and from livestock has been well documented [8]. In this 
context, livestock, milk and meat may serve as reservoirs 
for  human  infections  by  AMR  Staphylococcus  strains, 
thus allowing these microorganisms to persist and spread 
in  the  community.  Up  to  now,  many  researchers  have 
focused on the spread of resistant S. aureus in clinical set-
ting [11, 24]. However, only handful of studies have been 
conducted about the presence of AMR in food animals in 
Ethiopia [25, 26] and moreover, S. intermedius, S. hyicus 
and CNS have been poorly studied. Multiple-drug resist-
ant  (MDR)  staphylococcal  isolates  such  as  methicillin-
resistant S. aureus (MRSA) have been isolated primarily 
from human, and also from animal samples [27, 28]. A 
study conducted by Schmidt et al. [29] in the KwaZulu-
Natal  province  of  South  Africa  have  reported  humans 

working with farm animals carry far more AMR Staphy-
lococci than the farm animals they work with [29]. Thus, 
the  transfer  of  AMR  strains  of  Staphylococcus  between 
humans and cows may result in serious health problems.
In  Ethiopia,  irrational  antimicrobial  use  and  misuse 
behavior  is  frequent  [30],  which  could  exacerbate  the 
AMR issue in the country. The limited study on Staphy-
lococcus  species  isolated  from  chicken-related  samples 
in central and southern Ethiopia [31, 32] and Salmonella 
from  cattle-related  samples  in  south-eastern  Ethiopia 
[33]  have  reported  an  alarming  level  of  MDR  in  both 
bacteria. However, a good estimate of the magnitude of 
the prevalence of Staphylococcus species and their AMR 
pattern for both human and animals are hardly available 
in Ethiopia. Therefore, the aims of this study were to (i) 
isolate and identify Staphylococcus species in dairy farms 
and  slaughterhouses  in  Addis  Ababa  via  sampling  ani-
mals, food (milk and meat), farm and abattoir equipment 
and  personnel,  (ii)  determine  their  prevalence  distribu-
tion within farm and abattoir in different sample types, 
and  (iii)  evaluate  antimicrobial  susceptibility  profile  of 
Staphylococcus species.

Methods
Study area and design
This cross-sectional study was conducted from October 
2013 to April 2014 at Addis Ababa, which is situated at 
latitude  of  9°3′  and  38°43′  East  [34].  Samples  were  col-
lected from randomly selected dairy farms (dairy cows, 
farm personnel and dairy equipment) and Addis Ababa 
abattoir  enterprise  (slaughtered  cattle,  abattoir  per-
sonnel  and  abattoir  materials).  Hygienic  practices  of 
the  pre-milking,  milking  and  post  milking  activities  of 
dairy farms and pre-slaughtering, slaughtering and post 
slaughtering  activities  were  assessed  using  a  structured 
questionnaire.

Sample types, collection, transportation and storage
Overall, 193 samples were collected; samples from dairy 
farms included raw pooled udder milk (n = 40), tank milk 
(n = 8), pooled tank swabs (n = 8), pooled bucket swabs 
(n = 8) and pooled milkier hand swabs (n = 8). From the 
abattoir carcass swabs (n = 103), pooled slaughter lines 
swab from hanging materials (n = 6), pooled knife swabs 
(n = 6), pooled hand swabs (n = 6) were collected.
Samples  were  collected  aseptically  from  each  critical 
point. Raw milk samples were collected from two critical 
points, from the cows’ udder and milking bucket together 
with milkiers’ hand and container swabs. The swabbing 
was done before milk sampling using sterile swabs. From 
the abattoir, a pooled carcass swab included neck, fore-
legs, thoracic, abdomen, and hind legs. In addition, the 
slaughter  personnel’s  hands,  surface  of  meat-cutting

equipment  and  slaughter  line  were  swabbed  [35]  and 
each swab was kept in a different material.

For  every  swab  sample,  a  sterile  single  screw  capped 
tube  filled  with  4  ml  of  buffered  peptone  water  (BPW) 
was used. Prior to sampling, swab tips were moistened in 
the BPW and during sampling, the swab was rotated and 
rubbed against the sampled surface several times. After 
completion  of  swabbing,  the  swab  was  placed  inside  a 
screw-capped  tube  containing  BPW  and  transported 
using a cold chain to Microbiology laboratory of College 
of  Veterinary  Medicine  and  Agriculture,  Addis  Ababa 
University and stored at +4 °C for a maximum of 24 h 
until it was cultured [35].

Study methodology
Bacterial culture and species identification
The  techniques  recommended  by  the  International 
Organization  for  Standardization,  ISO  6888-3:  2003 
[35]  was  employed  for  the  isolation  and  identification 
of  Staphylococcus  species  from  abattoir  and  farm  sam-
ples. Final identification of Staphylococci organisms and 
species assignment were done based on Gram staining, 
hemolysis  of  blood  agar,  catalase  test,  sugar  fermenta-
tion test, oxidase test, coagulase test, oxidation–fermen-
tation test, and growth on mannitol salt agar and Purple 
agar base [35]. The biochemical test types used and the 
responses  of  Staphylococci  species  to  the  biochemical 
tests were summarized as shown in Table 1.

Antimicrobial sensitivity test
Disc  diffusion  testing  was  performed  for  Staphylococcal 
isolates  in  accordance  with  the  Clinical  and  Laboratory 
Standards  Institute  (CLSI)  (2008)  [36].  One  representa-
tive antimicrobial agent from each subclass of commonly 
used  antimicrobials  for  treatment  of  bovine  mastitis  or 
considered as important antimicrobial agents for human 
was  selected  for  susceptibility  testing.  The  phenotypic 
antimicrobial  sensitivity  response  of  each  isolate  was 
evaluated  using  panel  of  15  antimicrobial  discs.  The 

used  antimicrobial  agents  included  15  μg  erythromy-
cin (E), 10 μg streptomycin (S), 50 μg nitrofurantoin (F), 
10 unit penicillin-G (P), 5 μg ciprofloxacin (CIP), 25 μg 
sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim  (SXT),  5  μg  cloxacillin 
(OB), 30 μg cefoxitin (FOX), 30 μg chloramphenicol (C), 
30  μg  tetracycline  (TE),  10  μg  gentamycin  (CN),  30  μg 
vancomycin (VA), 30 μg kanamycin (K), 30 μg amoxicillin 
(AML), and 30 μg nalidixic acid (NA). All the discs were 
purchased from Oxoid, UK. The diameters of the zone of 
inhibition around the disks were measured to the nearest 
millimeter using rulers. The isolates were classified as sus-
ceptible, intermediate and resistant according to the inter-
pretative standards of CLSI (2008) [36]. Isolates showing 
resistance  to  three  or  more  antimicrobial  subclass  were 
considered as multiple drug resistant (MDR) [37].

Data analysis
Data was analyzed using SPSS software package (SPSS 20.0 
for window 7, SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). The proportions 
of Staphylococcus isolates in samples from the abattoir and 
dairy farms were computed. The Chi square (χ2) test was 
used to determine the difference in proportions of Staphy-
lococcus  among  different  sample  types  and  sources.  The 
significance level of α = 0.05 was taken as a cut-off value.
Results
Our  personal  observation  during  sample  collection 
showed that dairy farms and abattoir workers practiced 
substandard  hygiene.  The  number  of  Staphylococcus 
species isolated from personnel and equipment in dairy 
farms and abattoir was presented in Table 2.

Out of 193 samples, Staphylococci were isolated from 
92 (47.7%) samples, 36 from the dairy farms and 56 from 
the abattoir. The proportion of Staphylococcus isolates in 
the sample sources and types varied, but not significant 
(P > 0.05). Based on the biochemical tests, the predomi-
nant species was S. aureus (n = 31; 16.1%), followed by 
CNS (n = 24; 12.4%), S. intermedius (n = 21; 10.9%) and 
S. hyicus (n = 16; 8.3%) (Table 2).

Staphylococcus isolates from dairy farm
The  36  (50.0%)  isolates  identified  as  Staphylococci  spe-
cies  from  dairy  settings  were  tested  for  species  assign-
ment using biochemical characteristics. The majority of 
them were S. aureus (n = 15; 20.8%), followed by CNS 
(n = 9; 12.5%), S. intermedius (n = 6; 8.3%) and S. hyicus 
(n = 6; 8.3%). The frequency of isolation of Staphylococ-
cus varied between sample types and ranged from 37.5 to 
62.5%. Highest prevalence was observed in milkier hand 
swabs (62.5%), however, the difference was not significant 
(P > 0.05) (Table 2).

Staphylococcus isolates from abattoir
As indicated above from 121 abattoir source samples, 56 
(46.3%) isolates of Staphylococcus species were isolated. 
These isolates were grouped by biochemical test into S. 
aureus (n = 16; 13.2%), CNS (n = 15; 12.4%), S. interme-
dius (n = 15; 12.4%), and S. hyicus (n = 10; 8.3%). The 
frequency of isolation of Staphylococcus varied between 
sample types and ranged from 16.7 to 83.3%. The results 
showed  a  comparatively  higher  prevalence  in  knife  and 
slaughter hanging material swabs, each with 83.3%. This 
difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05).

Staphylococcus isolates from personnel
Staphylococcus  was  isolated  from  14  hand  swabs  from 
dairy farm workers (n = 8) and abattoir workers (n = 6). 
Staphylococcus  species  was  isolated  from  six  (42.9%) 
hand swab samples. The six isolates identified using bio-
chemical characteristics as S. aureus (n = 2; 14.3%), CNS 
(n = 2; 14.3%), S. intermedius (n = 1; 7.1%), and S. hyi-
cus (n = 1; 7.1%). The results showed a relatively higher 
prevalence in farm milkier hand swab having five (83.3%) 
compared to the one isolate (16.7%) from abattoir work-
ers’ hand swab. However, the difference was not statisti-
cally significant (P > 0.05).

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
Overall,  antimicrobial  susceptibility  test  was  performed 
on  43  Staphylococcus  isolates.  Eighteen  (41.9%)  isolates 
were  from  farms  and  25  (58.1%)  from  abattoir.  The  43 
isolates  tested  comprised  of  S.  aureus  (n =  15;  34.9%), 
CNS (n = 13; 30.2%), S. intermedius (n = 9; 20.9%), and 
S. hyicus (n = 6; 14.0%). Penicillin-G (P) resistance was 
the  highest  widespread  resistance  recorded  among  the 
isolates in this study (n = 41 isolates; 95.3%), followed by 
NA 38 (88.4%), OB 34 (79.1%), VA 28 (65.1%) and FOX 
24  (55.8%).  Conversely,  lower  resistance  was  recorded 
against  K  with  39  (90.7%)  susceptible  and  four  (9.3%) 
intermediates  (Table  3).  Of  the  15  antibiotics  tested, 
CN was currently the most effective drug as all of the 43 
(100.0%)  isolates  were  susceptible.  Among  the  isolates 
resistant to VA, S. aureus and CNS contributed for 39.3% 
(11/28) and 32.1% (9/28), respectively.
In this study, all of the S. aureus (n = 15; 100%), CNS 
(n = 13; 100%) and S. hyicus (n = 6; 100%) isolates exhib-
ited  MDR  as  each  isolate  at  least  resistant  to  >3  drugs 
simultaneously.  Among  the  nine  S.  intermedius  isolates 
tested,  8  (88.9%)  of  them  exhibited  MDR.  Alarmingly, 
some  isolates  of  Staphylococcus  species  demonstrated 
resistance to 13 different antimicrobial subclasses (MDR) 
at a time as shown in Table 4. The comparison of AMR 
patterns among various sample types showed there was 
not statistically significant differences (P > 0.05).

Discussion
Both coagulase-positive Staphylococci and CNS are com-
mensal opportunistic infections of animals and humans 
[38].  They  cause  superficial  skin  infection,  mastitis  and 
severe  invasive  diseases  in  farm  animals  and  wound 
infections  in  humans  [3,  5].  They  are  also  well  known 
for  their  food  poisoning  via  their  enterotoxins  [9,  13–
17] and for their ability to acquire AMR [38]. However,

a  good  estimate  of  the  magnitude  of  the  prevalence  of 
Staphylococcus species and their AMR pattern in differ-
ent  livestock  production  settings,  in  foods  of  livestock 
origin, and in humans involved in handling of the foods 
are poorly available in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was 
conducted  to  evaluate  the  prevalence  of  Staphylococci 
and their drug resistance in dairy farms and abattoir set-
tings of Addis Ababa.

In  this  study,  the  overall  prevalence  of  Staphylococci 
was  47.7%  of  193  tested  samples  collected  from  dairy 
farm  and  abattoir  settings,  suggesting  the  significant 

association  of  Staphylococci  species  with  livestock.  The 
Staphylococci prevalence was higher at both dairy farm 
(50.0%)  and  abattoir  (46.3%)  settings.  The  substandard 
hygienic practices during pre-milking, milking and post 
milking  activities  in  dairy  farms  might  have  contrib-
uted.  Milk  hygiene  and  udder-cleaning  operation  was 
insufficiently  conducted  in  Ethiopia  triggering  flare  up 
of  mastitis  [39].  In  this  regard,  poor  pre-milking  udder 
preparations  could  play  an  important  part  in  the  con-
tamination  of  milk  during  milking  [40,  41].  Similarly, 
poor  hygienic  practice  was  noticed  in  pre-slaughtering,

slaughtering  and  post  slaughtering  activities  within  the 
abattoir  during  this  study.  In  this  regards,  15.4%  of  the 
abattoir  workers  had  no  health  certificate  and  11.3%  of 
the butchers did not use protective clothes. There was no 
hot water, sterilizer and cooling facility in the abattoir in 
Ethiopia [42].

The  higher  prevalence  of  Staphylococci  at  both  dairy 
farm and abattoir settings in this study, indicating its (i) 
serious economic, animal welfare, food safety and pub-
lic  health  problem  and  (ii)  association  to  livestock  for 
its  transmission  between  animals  and  humans  in  live-
stock farm setting. Similar findings in its association with 
livestock  have  been  reported  from  elsewhere  [43,  44]. 
The predominant Staphylococci species detected in this 
study were S. aureus (16.1%), followed by CNS (12.4%), 
S. intermedius (10.9%), and S. hyicus (8.3%). These four 
Staphylococci species group are said to be the most path-
ogenic [5]. Furthermore, some animal-associated clones 
within these species group appear to have the capacity to 
colonize and cause disease in multiple host species [45]. 
They are versatile pathogens with the ability to transfer 
between  humans  and  different  livestock  [6,  9,  10]  with 
a possible switch from one-to-another host species [44, 
46].

The  Staphylococci  species  resilience  characteristics 
might be revealed in their ability to appear in a variety 
of locations in this study. In this regard, we isolated them 
from  bucket  swab  (37.5%),  tanks  swab  (50.0%),  tanks 
milk (50.0%), udder milk (50.0%), and milkier hand swabs 
(62.5%)  in  diary  settings.  We  also  isolated  them  from 
carcass  meat  (43.7%),  abattoir  workers’  hand  (16.7%), 
knife (83.3%) and slaughter hanging material (83.3%) in 
abattoir  settings.  Interestingly,  16.7%  of  abattoir  work-
ers  and  83.3%  of  milkier  personnel  carry  Staphylococci 
in their hand. It has been reported that about one-third 
of  humans  carry  Staphylococci  in  their  nasal  cavity 
[46].  Thus,  frequently  washing  of  the  abattoir  slaugh-
terers hand could be the possible factor responsible for 
the  relatively  low  prevalence  of  Staphylococcus  in  abat-
toir.  In  this  study,  Staphylococcus  isolates  were  isolated 
more  from  carcass  meat  swab  from  slaughtered  cattle 
than any other samples. This could be attributed to the 
higher sample size of the carcass meat samples than oth-
ers. The higher number of personnel workers at abattoir 
might  have  also  contributed  to  carcass  contamination. 
In general, our result revealed the substandard milk and 
meat  hygiene  and  personnel  and  equipment  hygiene 
practices  in  dairy  farms  and  abattoirs  during  handling, 
storage and processing of foods of livestock origin. Our 
finding agrees with the previous report from dairy farms, 
slaughterhouses, food-processing units and on the body 
parts of the animals and humans [12, 47]. For example, S. 
aureus (13.2%), CNS (12.4%), S. intermedius (12.4%), and 

S. hyicus (8.3%) were isolated from abattoir including car-
cass meat. Isolation of these Staphylococci species from 
meat demonstrated that they have entered the food chain 
to affect the food safety and public health [48, 49]. Con-
tamination of milk and meat by them could lead to food 
poisoning through production of Staphylococcal entero-
toxins. Available literature indicated that 62.9% of isolates 
from sheep milk [50] and 15–55.9% of isolates from dairy 
products  [16,  51–53]  produce  enterotoxin  with  marked 
geographical  differences.  Although  this  is  beyond  the 
scope of our paper, the culture of raw milk and raw meat 
consumption  in  Ethiopia  might  be  potential  sources  of 
Staphylococcal enterotoxin food poisonings to the public.
The prevalence of S. aureus in 193 tested samples was 
31(16.1%).  S.  aureus  was  isolated  from  nearly  all  sam-
ple  types  with  different  proportion,  but  not  from  abat-
toir  slaughter  worker’s  hand  swab  (0.0%).  This  finding 
is  similar  with  the  17.2%  prevalence  in  Egypt  [54]  and 
19.5%  from  human  and  animal  sources  [55],  but  lower 
than 75% in bovine bulk milks [56], 68% [14], 61.3% [57], 
40% [58] and 82.2% from cheeses made from raw cow’s 
milk [59]. The 10.9% S. intermedius prevalence detected 
in our study was similar with the 13% in cheese samples 
[59]  but  higher  than  the  2%  in  milk  and  milk  product 
samples  [58].  Similarly,  the  prevalence  of  S.  hyicus  was 
8.3% in our study. Almost half of the total isolates were 
isolated from carcass swab. It was higher than the 4% in 
milk and milk product samples [58] and 4.5% in cheeses 
[59]. CNS was the second most isolated species next to 
S. aureus in this study. It was isolated from almost all the 
samples except in knife swab. The predominant propor-
tion of CNS was isolated from carcass swab. The overall 
prevalence of CNS was 12.4%, which was lower than the 
54% in raw milk of cattle in Mongolia [60] and 29% [59]. 
The high number of CNS isolation in the current study 
may be indicator for poor hygienic practices in the dairy 
farms and abattoir. CNS is a part of the normal teat skin 
flora,  mucosa  of  humans  and  animals,  and  also  found 
free living in the environment [61, 62]. In the past, CNS 
was often regarded as skin flora opportunists. However, 
recent data indicate that they are associated with several 
subclinical and clinical infections [63].

Of  43  isolates,  42  (97.7%)  had  resistance  to  at  least 
one of the 15 antimicrobials tested. It had been reported 
that  about  90%  of  S.  aureus  isolated  from  patients  was 
found resistant in 1980s [64]. The antimicrobials we cur-
rently evaluated could be subjectively classified into four 
based on magnitude of resistance recorded in this study. 
These  include  (i)  highly  effective  antimicrobials  where 
all  isolates  were  susceptible,  (ii)  effective  antimicrobials 
as  >95%  isolates  were  susceptible,  (iii)  still  usable  anti-
microbials as >50% of isolates were susceptible, and (iv) 
not  recommended  for  use  as  >55%  of  the  isolates  were 

Beyene et al. BMC Res Notes  (2017) 10:171 

Page 7 of 9

resistant. In this regard, the general drug use policy rec-
ommends antimicrobials for use especially for treatment 
of infection in humans only if less than half (<55%) of the 
isolates are resistant [65].

Accordingly, CN and K are the most effective antimi-
crobials as all of the 43 Staphylococci isolates were sus-
ceptible to both in this study. In fact, four (9.3%) of the 43 
isolates had intermediate breakpoint response to K. Our 
finding  was  similar  to  earlier  studies  in  other  countries 
[55,  66,  67].  Few  isolates  had  resistance  to  CIP  (2.3%), 
thus,  fits  to  the  second  antimicrobial  category  listed 
above.  Third,  resistant  among  isolates  ranges  between 
16.3  and  48.8%  for  some  antimicrobials  in  this  study. 
Antimicrobials  in  this  group  include  S  (16.3%),  SXT 
(20.9%), AML (23.3%), C (23.3%), TE (34.9%), E (46.5%), 
and F (48.8%). Our finding is comparable to the findings 
of others [26], but contrary to the findings in Taiwan [47]. 
Fourth, >55% of the Staphylococci isolates had resistance 
to cefoxitin (55.8%), VA (65.1%), OB (79.1%), NA (88.4%), 
and P (95.3%). The resistance value recorded to P (95.3%) 
was the highest in this study. In another study in different 
geographical areas showed that it was 87.2% in Ethiopia 
[68], 80% in Sweden [69], 57% in Iran [70], 50% in Fin-
land [71], and 23% in West India [72]. In a separate study, 
70–73% of S. aureus strains isolated from various foods 
were resistant to β-lactam such as P and ampicillin [73]. 
Penicillin (P) and other β-lactam antibiotics are the most 
commonly used antimicrobials for the treatment of infec-
tion  of  mastitis  in  veterinary  practice  in  Ethiopia  [64]. 
The higher prevalence of penicillin resistant isolate could 
be, therefore, related to prolonged, improper and indis-
criminate usage as suggested by some authors [64, 74].

Overall,  all  (100%)  of  S.  aureus,  CNS,  and  S.  hyicus 
(whilst  88.9%  of  S.  intermedius)  isolates  had  resistance 
to >3 antimicrobials (MDR) of all the tested drugs. The 
share of MDR isolate by Staphylococci species among 43 
isolates was 34.9% S. aureus, 30.2% CNS, 20.9% S. inter-
medius, and 14.0% S. hyicus (Table 3) although it was not 
significantly  different  between  Staphylococcus  species. 
Most of MDR was primarily due to P, NA, OB, VA and 
FOX in this study. This finding is higher than the study 
result of Moon et al. [75] who reported that about two 
out of 21 S. aureus has been reported to be resistant to >3 
of  non-β-lactam  antimicrobials  including  P  and  E  [75]. 
Furthermore,  higher  MDR  was  observed  in  our  study 
than  (79%)  among  isolates  reported  in  Korea  [76]  and 
at  Jimma  Hospital,  Ethiopia  (80%)  [77].  The  abundance 
of  MDR  Staphylococci  isolated  from  milk  (farm),  meat 
(abattoir),  equipment  and  humans  could  pose  a  risk  to 
public health. Transfer of antimicrobial resistant bacteria 
to humans has been reported via the food chain [23] and 
from livestock [8]. AMR is a major public health burden 
worldwide  [22].  Staphylococcus  strains  have  developed 

MDR worldwide with broad diversity in prevalence rate 
in different regions [37].

Conclusions
The  present  study  revealed  high  proportion  of  Staphy-
lococcus  species  (47.7%)  (S.  aureus,  S.  intermedius,  S. 
hyicus  and  CNS)  in  dairy  farms  and  abattoir  settings 
at  Addis  Ababa.  Higher  proportion  of  isolation  rate  of 
Staphylococcus  species  from  farm  and  abattoir  person-
nel signals the existence of poor hygienic practices and 
consequently, its public health implication. All the tested 
isolates for antimicrobial susceptibility showed resistance 
to at least three antimicrobial agents except one S. inter-
midius isolate susceptible to all tested drugs. The isolates 
also showed good susceptibility profile to CN, K, and CIP, 
but resistance was observed against P, NA, OB, VA and 
FOX. Moreover, MDR was also observed against some of 
the commonly used antimicrobial agents. Thus, improv-
ing hygienic measures in the dairy farms as well as within 
the abattoir must be effected to safeguard the public from 
risk of staphylococcal food poisoning and acquiring MDR 
isolates.  Additionally,  future  research  should  consider 
identifying  Staphylococcus  enterotoxins  from  milk  and 
meat and genes responsible for AMR in Ethiopia.
