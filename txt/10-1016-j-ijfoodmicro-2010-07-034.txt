A total of 387 retail meat, seafood and milk powder samples were collected from nine cities in northern
China in 2005 and screened for the presence of Salmonella. Salmonella strains isolated were subjected to
serotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Salmonella was isolated from 81 (20.9%, 81/387) samples
and classiﬁed into 23 serotypes. The isolates were frequently resistant to sulfamethoxazole (86.4%),
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (48.1%), nalidixic acid (30.9%), tetracycline (19.8%), carboxybenzylpenicillin
(17.3%), amoxicillin (17.3%) and ampicillin (16.0%). The multiple resistance (resistance to ≥3 antibiotics)
was found in 29.6% (n =24) isolates. Additionally, 4 isolates from chicken displayed the ACSSuTNx proﬁle,
resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamide, tetracycline and nalidixic acid, in
particular, strain HBS084 showing the resistance to as many as 20 antibiotics. Salmonella from chicken
showed the higher frequency of antimicrobial resistance. Our ﬁndings indicate that in northern China food
products of animal origin can be a source of exposure for consumers to multiresistant Salmonella strains.

1. Introduction

Salmonella that includes more than 2500 different serotypes
represents a leading cause of foodborne infections worldwide (Chen
et al., 2004; Magistrali et al., 2008; White et al., 2002). The majority of
the infections are associated with ingestion of contaminated foods
such as poultry, beef, pork, egg, milk, cheese, seafood, fruits, juice and
vegetables (Brands et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2008).

Salmonella gastroenteritis is generally self-limiting illness, but
severe cases in immuno-compromised individuals, elderly persons or
neonates, and systemic infections may require effective chemother-
apy (Lee et al., 1994). Currently the increasing prevalence of
multidrug resistance among Salmonella and resistance to clinically
important antimicrobial agents such as ﬂuoroquinolones and third-
generation cephalosporins has also been an emerging problem in
China and other countries (Brands et al., 2005; Chao et al., 2007;
Gebreyes and Thakur, 2005). Additionally, multidrug-resistant Sal-
monella have been isolated, and they are in many serotypes, such as
Agona, Anatum, Choleraesuis, Derby, Dublin, Heidelberg, Kentucky,
Newport, Pullorum, Schwarzengrund, Senftenberg, Typhimurium and

Uganda (Chen et al., 2004; Gebreyes et al., 2004; Gebreyes and
Thakur, 2005; Pan et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2008). Therefore, the
particular concern is severity of the multidrug resistance in Salmo-
nella. The levels of resistance are varied and inﬂuenced by antimicro-
bial use to humans and animals, as well as the geographical
differences. In China, a major producer and consumer of animal
source foods, the per capita consumption of meats and seafood has
increased signiﬁcantly over the past century. With this increase in
consumption of food products of animal origin, it also comes with the
increased potential for exposure to foodborne pathogens through the
food chain. According to the foodborne diseases outbreaks report
which was released by the National Foodborne Diseases Surveillance
Network in China, during 1992–2005, among bacterial foodborne
illness outbreaks, salmonellosis is the second leading cause, and
approximately 10–20% of the outbreaks were caused by Salmonella
annually (Chen et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2004, 2006, 2008).

Historically, most studies on the prevalence and characterization
of the antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella have been restricted to
the isolates from clinical and/or veterinary sources (Khan et al., 2009;
Randall et al., 2004). Information on the potential role of food samples
in dissemination of multidrug-resistant Salmonella in China is very
limited. In the present study, we reported prevalence, serotypes, and
antibiotic resistance patterns of Salmonella strains isolated from food
products of animal origin in nine cities of Hebei province in the
northern China in 2005. Our overall aim was to clarify the correlation
of the antimicrobial resistance proﬁles, serotypes and isolation

sources, and to identify the most likely food sources responsible for
human salmonellosis outbreak in China.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Collection of food samples and isolation of Salmonella

Salmonella isolates were obtained through the National Active
Foodborne Pathogens Surveillance System. As shown in Table 1, a
total of 387 food samples including pork (n=45), chicken (n=120),
beef (n=45), mutton (n=45), seafood (n=96) and milk powder
(n=36) were randomly collected in open-air markets and large
supermarkets of nine surveillance points in Hebei province, located in
the northern part of China in 2005. The strains were independently
isolated from different and individual food samples.

Salmonella isolation and identiﬁcation were performed as de-
scribed previously (Chen et al., 2004; Dziadkowiec et al., 1995), with
some modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, each sample (25 g) was placed in
separate sterile plastic bags and washed with 225 ml buffered
peptone water (BPW) with shaking vigorously for 2 min. The rinse
was incubated at 37 °C in a water bath with shaking at 100 rpm for
8 h, then 10 ml of buffered peptone water was added to 100 ml
selenite cystine broth at 37 °C for 24 h. A loop of inoculum from the
selenite cystine broth was streaked onto bismuth sulﬁte agar and
Hektoen enteric agar and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. A minimum of
two of presumptive Salmonella colonies were picked from each plate
and stabbed into triple sugar iron and lysine–iron agar slants,
respectively, incubated for 24 h at 36 °C. Isolates with positive slant
reactions were then tested for agglutination with ATB ID 32E, which is
a standardized system for the identiﬁcation of Enterobacteriaceae and
other nonfastidious gram negative rods, and the result was deter-
mined automatically using the ATB Expression system (BioMérieux,
Lyon, France).

Salmonella isolates were stored in Luria–Bertani (LB) broth

containing 15% glycerol at − 80 °C until use.

(5 μg), oﬂoxacin (5 μg), tetracycline (30 μg), and chloramphenicol
(30 μg). The classes of the resistance level were deﬁned as described
by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, 2005) and
indicated as susceptible (S),
intermediate (I) or resistance (R).
Escherichia coli strain ATCC 25922 and ATCC 35218 were used as
control strains.

2.4. Statistical analysis

The statistical package SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was

used, and the P value less than 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.

According to the manufacturer's instructions, serotyping of
Salmonella isolates was carried out with the antisera available
commercially (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA).

3. Results and discussion

2.3. Susceptibility testing

A total of 28 antimicrobial agents currently used in the veterinary
and medical therapy were used. By the Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion
method, the isolates were tested against ampicillin (10 μg), piper-
acillin (100 μg), carboxybenzylpenicillin (100 μg), amoxicillin (20 μg),
cefazolin (30 μg), cephalothin (30 μg), ceftriaxone (30 μg), cefoper-
azone (75 μg), ceftazidime (30 μg), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (20/

3.1. Prevalence of Salmonella in retail food products

A total of 81 Salmonella isolates were recovered, representing
20.9% of samples tested (Table 1). The prevalence of Salmonella in food
products of other provinces in China was 2.32% in 2000 (Wang et al.,
2002), 3.32% in 2001, and 3.55% in 2002 (Wang et al., 2004). The
relatively higher isolation rate (23.9%) from meats observed in the
present study is consistent with previous reports from China as well
as other parts of the world (Chen et al., 2004; Chao et al., 2007; Van et
al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2008). These data can also support the previous
reports indicating that retail meat accounted for the largest
percentage (10–60%) of all food poisoning related outbreaks of
Salmonella infections in China (Chen et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2004, 2006,
2008). Moreover, we have also found the levels of Salmonella
contamination in seafood samples were much higher (20.8%),
indicating another potential cause of higher rate of enteric diseases.
No Salmonella was isolated from milk powder. Previous reports have
also suggested that milk and its products accounted for less than 5% of
all food poisoning related outbreaks of Salmonella infections in China
(Chen et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2004, 2006, 2008).

3.2. Serotyping and antibiotics susceptibility

Salmonella isolates are shown in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. The

resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents was predominantly seen
in Derby, Indiana and Saintpaul serotypes (Table 5). Additionally,
resistant phenotypes appear to be associated with particular
serotypes, for example, all isolates of S. Indiana and S. Saintpaul
isolates were multiresistant to ﬁve classes of antibiotics, including β-
lactams, sulfonamides, ﬂuoroquinolones, chloramphenicol and tetra-
cycline. Due to the limited number of isolates from foods, it is difﬁcult
to assess evidently the relationship between serotype and multiresistance.
Resistance to sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and
nalidixic acid was very common, this ﬁnding is in agreement with studies
from China and other countries (Chen et al., 2004; White et al., 2001, 2002;
Pan et al., 2009; Van et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2008). Nalidixic acid resistance
was especially prevalent in isolates from chicken meat. Previous studies
showed that Salmonella was predominant in chickens and particularly
resistant to quinolones including nalidixic acid since 2000 (Cheong et al.,
2007; Padungtod and Kaneene, 2006). These ﬁndings may not be
surprising as trimethoprim in combination with sulfamethoxazole has
been used for 30 years in human and veterinary medicine (Poros-
Gluchowska and Markiewicz, 2003), and quinolones and ﬂuoroquino-
lones are being used broadly in veterinary medicine in China since 1980s
(Chen et al., 2004).

In the present study, less than 5% of strains were resistant to ﬁrst
generation (cefazolin and cephalothin) and third-generation cepha-
losporins (ceftazadime). Other reports describe a decreasing suscep-
tibility of Salmonella strains from food products and veterinary
sources to these antimicrobials (Chao et al., 2007; Pan et al., 2009).

In the current study, Salmonella isolated from chicken showed a
greater degree of multiresistance than that from seafood and other
meats (p=0.0002) (Tables 4 and 5). It was observed that 9 isolates,
8 from chicken and 1 from seafood, were resistant to at least 10

antimicrobials, including 4 isolates (HBS121, HBS145, HBS138, and
HBS084) from chicken revealing the ACSSuTNx proﬁle (resistance to
ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamide, tetracycline,
and nalidixic acid). Interestingly, strain HBS084, of which serotype is
Indiana, showed the resistance to as many as 20 antibiotics (Table 5).
In conclusion, food products of animal origin may pose a risk in
serving as reservoirs and disseminating resistant Salmonella in Hebei
province of China. To reduce the risk of Salmonella infection, this will
require close cooperation between sectors involved in food hygiene,
prevention and control of diseases transmitted from animals to
humans, hospital infection control, resistance monitoring and prudent
use of antimicrobials in humans and animals. Additionally, consumers
should be very careful for high-risk foods, and take proper care for
prevention of the growth of the microorganisms, e.g., short-term

refrigerated storage of perishable foods and cooking before consump-
tion. For better understanding of Salmonella contamination sources
and prevention strategies, a large-scale future study is required in
particular endemic areas with samples collected from the consumers,
retail food shops, food-processing plants as well as from other natural
sources. Therefore a holistic management approach may be needed to
signiﬁcantly reduce the overall burden of Salmonella on human health.
