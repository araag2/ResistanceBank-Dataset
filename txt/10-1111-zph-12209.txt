Impacts
(cid:129) Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and strains with diverse
antimicrobial resistant patterns are prevalent in milk from semi-extensive
dairy cows in north-eastern Brazil.
(cid:129) Staphylococcus aureus from milk were clonally associated with bovine staph-
ylococci lineage strains, which have been found in other regions of Brazil
and worldwide.
(cid:129) Although MRSA was also isolated from milkers‚Äô hands, its low frequency and
distinct genotype from those MRSA found in milk suggest the possibility of
the farmers contaminating the milk with resistant isolates, particularly MRSA.

Summary

The aim of this study was to investigate the phenotypic and genotypic diversity
and anti-microbial resistance among staphylococci of dairy herds that originated
from Paraiba State, north-eastern Brazil, a region where such studies are rare.
Milk samples (n = 552) were collected from 15 dairy farms. Isolates were evalu-
ated for anti-microbial susceptibility by Kirby‚ÄìBauer disc diffusion method. Con-
Ô¨Årmation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was performed
using multiplex PCR targeting mecA and nuc genes in addition to phenotypic
assay based on PBP-2a latex agglutination. Clonal relatedness of isolates was
determined by pulsed-Ô¨Åeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence
typing (MLST) genotyping. Staphylococci were detected in 269 (49%) of the sam-
ples. Among these, 65 (24%) were S. aureus. The remaining 204 isolates were
either coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 188; 70%) or coagulase positive
other than S. aureus (n = 16; 6%). Staphylococci were cultured in seven (35%)
of the 20 hand swab samples, from which Ô¨Åve isolates were S. aureus. The isolates
were most commonly resistant against penicillin (43%), ampicillin (38%) and
oxacillin (27%). The gene mecA was detected in 21 S. aureus from milk and in
one isolate from a milker‚Äôs hand. None of the isolates were resistant to vancomy-
cin. PFGE Ô¨Åndings showed high clonal diversity among the isolates. Based on
MLST, we identiÔ¨Åed a total of 11 different sequence types (STs 1, 5, 6, 83, 97,
126, 1583, 1622, 1623, 1624 and 1625) with four novel STs (ST1622-ST1625).
The Ô¨Åndings show that MRSA is prevalent in milk from semi-extensive dairy
cows in north-eastern Brazil, and further investigation on its extent in various
types of milk production systems and the farm-to-table continuum is warranted.

Introduction

Staphylococci are ubiquitous bacteria in mammalian spe-
cies associated with different types of infections in humans,

companion animals and livestock. Staphylococcus aureus is
a major pathogen causing skin infections in humans as
well as clinical and subclinical mastitis in cows and other
milk-producing animals. Its occurrence in primary food

sources and role as a foodborne pathogen have not been
elucidated.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has
been widely known as a major nosocomial pathogen [often
referred as hospital-associated (HA) MRSA] and also
implicated as a major source of community-associated
infections in recent years (Gray, 2004; Crum et al., 2006).
MRSA strains express an alternative penicillin binding pro-
tein (PBP2a), which has a low afÔ¨Ånity to b-lactam agents
(Hartman and Tomasz, 1984). This protein is encoded by
the mecA gene usually found in large mobile genetic ele-
ments named staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec
(SCCmec), which can also confer resistance to anti-micro-
bial classes other than b-lactam agents making the infec-
tions more difÔ¨Åcult to be treated (Mombach Pinheiro
Machado et al., 2007).

There is a worldwide increase of community-acquired
MRSA infections (CA-MRSA) (Simor et al., 2010). Com-
munity-acquired MRSA have been reported increasingly in
the last two decades and in some cases have been shown to
be different from HA-MRSA (Vandenesch et al., 2003).
Although staphylococcal food poisoning outbreaks caused
by milk and dairies consumption have been reported
worldwide (Yamane, 2006), the role of livestock and the
overall signiÔ¨Åcance of MRSA as a foodborne pathogen
remains to be investigated. The Ô¨Årst reported CA-MRSA
infection in Brazil was found to be associated with ST30-
SCCmecIV (Rozenbaum et al., 2009), while the majority of
HA-MRSA infections is associated with the clone ST239-
MRSA-IIIA (Oliveira and De Lencastre, 2002). Overall,
studies on MRSA in Brazil have often been limited to the
more temperate southern regions. There is paucity of data
on the status of CA-MRSA in the more tropical north-east-
ern as well as Amazonian regions.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was Ô¨Årst
reported in milking cows in 1972 (Devriese and Hommez,
1975), and it has been reported from milk in other coun-
tries (Kwon et al., 2005; Haran et al., 2012). Despite the
few reports, characterization of MRSA from the milk value
chain is overall scarce. While MRSA detected in foodstuff
do not often match the isolates associated with human
infection episodes (Hata et al., 2008), some clonal com-
plexes found in human staphylococcal intoxications, such
as CC5 and CC30, have been detected in milk from mastitic
cows (Rabello et al., 2007). In recent years, unique strains
of MRSA, such as sequence type (ST) 398, commonly des-
ignated as livestock-associated (LA) MRSA, have been
reported from pigs and other food animals in various parts
of the world. The higher risk of harbouring MRSA ST398
has been associated with subpopulations that are in contact
to food animals, particularly pigs (Van Loo et al., 2007).
The genetic relatedness of MRSA from humans and animals
strongly support that ST398 or clonal complex (CC) 398 is

indeed a ‚Äòlivestock associated‚Äô MRSA (LA-MRSA) (Khanna
et al., 2008; Golding et al., 2010; Hasman et al., 2010;
Huber et al., 2010; LoefÔ¨Çer and Lloyd, 2010).

Characterization of MRSA from animal-derived foods
and investigations on the epidemiology of MRSA in animal
production systems are essential to elucidate the role of live-
stock and associated environment in the persistence and dis-
semination of MRSA in community settings. The objective
of the present study was to determine the occurrence, MRSA
and genotypic characterization of staphylococci from small-
holder semi-extensive milk production systems in the north-
eastern Brazil. To our knowledge, this is among the few
reports on the MRSA detection in livestock in this region.

Methods

Study design and origin of samples
A total of 15 dairy farms that were located within the State
of Paraiba, north-eastern Brazil, were included in this study.
The herd size of the farms ranged from 8 to 40 lactating
cows. Farms were managed with a semi-extensive produc-
tion system on natural pasture, and at different stages of lac-
tation. The breeds included mixed Holstein (Bos taurus)
and Gir (Bos indicus), a local zebu breed. Milk samples were
collected after each teat was disinfected using 70% ethanol
and dried with disposable paper towels. The Ô¨Årst few
streams of milk (foremilk) was discarded to avoid surface
contamination, and 15 ml samples were collected using
sterile glass tubes and kept on ice for transportation to the
Federal University of Paraiba (UFPB) laboratory. Milkers‚Äô
hand swabbing was performed after milking only from
those who provided a written consent to participate in the
study. Palms were swabbed with moistened cotton placed in
Stuart‚Äôs medium for transportation to the laboratory.

Staphylococci culture and isolation
A loopful of milk samples was streaked onto Baird‚ÄìParker
agar (Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, UK) supplemented with egg
yolk tellurite (Remel, Lenexa, KS, USA) and mannitol salt
agar (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ,
USA). After incubation for 24 h at 37¬∞C, colonies showing
morphological characteristics of staphylococci were evalu-
ated by Gram staining and catalase for genus identiÔ¨Åcation.
Cultivation on DNase agar (Oxoid Ltd) for 24 h at 37¬∞C
were used for initial screening and S. aureus and conÔ¨Årmed
using latex agglutination-based kit for S. aureus (Staphy-
test; Probac do Brazil, S~ao Paulo, Brazil).

Anti-microbial susceptibility testing

Anti-microbial susceptibility testing of isolates was per-
formed using Kirby‚ÄìBauer disc diffusion method according

to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI, 2013; Vet01-S4 and Vet01-S2). BrieÔ¨Çy, col-
onies were suspended in 0.7% saline and standardized to
0.5 McFarland. They were cultured onto Mueller‚ÄìHinton
(MH) agar and incubated at 37¬∞C for 18‚Äì24 h. Results were
obtained after interpreting the zones of inhibition against
nine antimicrobial drugs. The anti-microbials, abbrevia-
tions and disc potency were as follows: ampicillin (Am;
10 lg), ceftiofur (Cf; 30 lg), cephalothin (Ch; 30 lg),
erythromycin (Er; 15 lg), oxacillin (Ox; 1 lg), penicillin
(Pn; 10 U), pirlimycin (Pr; 2 lg), penicillin + novobiocin
(Pv; 30/24 lg), tetracycline (Te; 30 lg) and vancomycin
(Vc; 30 lg). Penicillin + novobiocin discs were made in
the laboratory following the protocol by Thornsberry et al.
(1997). BrieÔ¨Çy, 20 ll of a 312.5 lg/ml penicillin solution,
made from penicillin G potassium salt (Acros Organics,
Fair Lawn, NJ, USA), was added to a 30/24 lg novobiocin
disc. This resulted in 6.25 lg (10 U) of penicillin per 30 lg
novobiocin disc. The discs were prepared fresh under asep-
tic conditions and used on the same day. Reference strains
Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, S. aureus ATCC 25923 and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were used (American
Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA). Multidrug
resistance (MDR) was deÔ¨Åned here as resistance to three or
more classes of antimicrobials.

PCR for S. aureus and MRSA conÔ¨Årmation

Genomic DNA was extracted using a commercial kit
(DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kits, Qiagen, Valencia, CA,
USA) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs guidelines. BrieÔ¨Çy,
the lysis buffer contains a mixture of 20 mM pH 8.0 Tris‚Äì
HCl
(Fisher BioReagents, Fairlawn, NJ, USA), 2 mM
sodium EDTA (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), 1% Triton
X-100 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 20 mg/ml lyso-
zyme (Lysozyme Ultrapure; USB Corporation, Cleveland,
OH, USA). Molecular biology grade water (Eppendorf,
Hamburg, Germany) was used for the elution. DNA was
stored at 4¬∞C for further genotypic analyses. The genes nuc
(S. aureus conÔ¨Årmatory gene) and mecA (gene that encodes
methicillin resistance) were detected using a duplex PCR in
conditions previously reported (Oliveira and De Lencastre,
2002). The primers used for nuc gene ampliÔ¨Åcation

with an expected amplicon size of 861 bp. PCRs were
performed using beads (GE Healthcare Life Sciences,
Piscataway, NJ, USA) in a Ô¨Ånal reaction volume of 25 ll
containing 1 ll of template DNA. Thermocycling was per-
formed using the following conditions: initial denaturation
at 95¬∞C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 95¬∞C for 1 min,
54¬∞C for 1 min, 72¬∞C for 1 min and a Ô¨Ånal extension step
of 72¬∞C for 7 min. Aliquots of the PCR products (10 ll)
were electrophoresed in 2% agarose gels containing ethidi-
um bromide and visualized by ultraviolet transilluminator.
The amplicons were visualized using Gel Doc 2000 (Bio-
Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) and analysed by
Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories).

Genotyping by pulsed-Ô¨Åeld gel electrophoresis

Pulsed-Ô¨Åeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed
according to a modiÔ¨Åed protocol as recommended previ-
ously (Mulvey et al., 2001). BrieÔ¨Çy, S. aureus isolates were
grown overnight on MH agar (Becton, Dickinson and Com-
pany). The bacterial cell concentration was adjusted by
diluting cells with sterile cell suspension buffer to the OD
value 1.35 (range 1.3‚Äì1.4) at 610 nm wavelength. Agarose-
embedded cells were lysed, and intact genomic DNA was
digested with 25‚Äì40 U of SmaI restriction enzyme (New
England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) for at least 2 hours at
25¬∞C. The fragments were separated by CHEF DR-III sys-
tem (Bio-Rad Laboratories) with the following conditions
and reagents: 1% SeaKem Gold agarose (FMC BioProducts,
Rockland, ME, USA) in 0.59 Tris-borate-EDTA buffer,
temperature at 14¬∞C, voltage at 6 v/cm, run time of 19 h
with initial switch time of 5.3 and Ô¨Ånal switch time of
34.9 s. The PulseNet
‚Äòuniversal‚Äô standard marker strain
S. enterica serovar Braenderup H9812 was used as a molecu-
lar reference marker. The gels were stained with ethidium
bromide and visualized under UV trans-illumination, and
images were captured using Gel Doc 2000 (Bio-Rad Labora-
tories). PFGE gels were analysed by Bionumerics software
V. 4.61 (Applied Maths NV, Keistraat, Belgium) using Dice
similarity index and unweighted pair group average (UP-
GMA) cluster analysis. Banding patterns were compared
with 1% optimization and 1% band position tolerance.

Genotyping by multilocus sequence typing

Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed as
described before (Enright et al., 2000). Seven housekeeping
genes were targeted, and all the primers used were as rec-
ommended by the MLST global database system (http://
www.mlst.net). After DNA extraction, PCR ampliÔ¨Åcation

was performed on the seven targeted housekeeping genes:
carbamate kinase (arcC), shikimate dehydrogenase (aroE),
glycerol kinase (glk), guanylate kinase (gmk), phosphate
acetyltransferase (pta), triosephosphate isomerase (tpi) and
acetyl coenzyme A acetyltransferase (yqiL). PCRs were per-
formed using beads (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) in a Ô¨Ånal
reaction volume of 25 ll containing 1 ll of template DNA.
AmpliÔ¨Åcation was performed using a PTC-100 Program-
mable Thermal Controller (MJ Research Inc, Watertown,
MA, USA) with an initial 5-min denaturation at 95¬∞C, fol-
lowed by 30 cycles of annealing at 55¬∞C for 1 min, exten-
sion at 72¬∞C for 1 min and denaturation at 95¬∞C for 1 min,
followed by a Ô¨Ånal extension step of 72¬∞C for 5 min. The
ampliÔ¨Åed products were precipitated with 20% polyethyl-
ene glycol-2.5 M NaCl, resuspended in cold 70% ethanol
and reprecipitated; the DNA sequences of both strand were
determined using an automated sequencer (CEQ8000;
Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA) using 30 cycles
comprised by a denaturation step at 96¬∞C for 20 s, anneal-
ing at 50¬∞C for 20 s and elongation at 60¬∞C for 4 min. Alle-
lic proÔ¨Åles of the seven genes were assigned by comparing
the sequences at each locus to those of the known alleles in
the S. aureus MLST database (http://www.mlst.net). Based
on the allelic proÔ¨Åles for the seven genes for each of the iso-
lates, a ST was assigned.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistical analysis was used to provide informa-
tion about prevalence of Staphylococcus, and anti-microbial
susceptibility proÔ¨Åling. Data were analysed using the Fish-
er‚Äôs exact and the chi-square tests (SPSS 17.0; SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA) to compare the proportion of the phe-
notypic and genotypic differences of staphylococcal isolates
among the farms. Analyses were considered signiÔ¨Åcant
when P-value was < 0.05.

Results

Occurrence of S. aureus and other staphylococci. Of the
total 552 milk samples, 269 (49%) were positive for staphy-
lococci. The majority of these isolates (188; 70%) was iden-
tiÔ¨Åed as coagulase-negative staphylococci. A total of 65
(24%) Staphylococcus aureus and 16 (5.9%) coagulase-posi-
tive isolates other than S. aureus (n = 16) were also identi-
Ô¨Åed. At least one sample from all the 15 farms were found
to be positive for S. aureus with farm level prevalence rang-
ing between 5% and 25%. S. aureus was identiÔ¨Åed in 35%
(7 of 20) of the hand swab samples, from which Ô¨Åve isolates
(71%) were S. aureus, one coagulase-negative staphylococci
and one coagulase positive other than S. aureus.

Anti-microbial resistance phenotypes and occurrence of
MRSA. Frequency of anti-microbial resistance among the

staphylococci from milk samples is shown in Table 1. Of
the 269 staphylococci isolates, two-third (67%) were resis-
tant to at least one anti-microbial. About half (49%) of the
S. aureus isolates and 42% of CoNS isolates were pan-sus-
ceptible. At the farm level, proportion of pan-susceptibility
ranged from 0% to 65%. Isolates were most commonly
resistant to b-lactams including penicillin (43%), ampicil-
lin (38%) and oxacillin (27%); followed by tetracycline
(14%) and the macrolide and erythromycin (11%). There
was statistically signiÔ¨Åcant difference in the proportion of
resistance among the farms for ampicillin (P = 0.05), oxa-
cillin (P = 0.001) and penicillin (P = 0.006) but not for the
remaining anti-microbial agents. No vancomycin resistance
was detected. MDR was found in 8.9% of the isolates (24 of
269), from which 16 were S. aureus and eight were coagu-
lase-positive staphylococci other than S. aureus. There was
a large variation in proportion of MDR among the 15
farms, and the differences were not statistically signiÔ¨Åcant
(P = 0.368).

Twenty-one isolates from milk (8% of all staphylococci)
and one milkers‚Äô hand were also mecA positive and identi-

MRSA in Brazilian Dairy Farms

Ô¨Åed as MRSA based on phenotypic (PBP-2 latex agglutina-
tion) as well. Overall, 34 different anti-microbial resistance
patterns were identiÔ¨Åed (Table 2). Not all MRSA isolates
were MDR. AmPn R-type was the most predominant
among S. aureus (n = 33), while Ox only R-type was the
most common among CoNS species (n = 26) followed by
AmPn (n = 11).

strains of S. aureus, we found seven isolates carried both
mecA and blaZ, 10 carried mecA but not blaZ, two carried
blaZ but not mecA, and four were found to carry neither.
Neither of the two isolates with blaZ but no mecA were
found to be phenotypically oxacillin resistant. On the other
hand, all the seven isolates that carried both mecA and blaZ
were found to be multidrug resistant with resistance to at
least three anti-microbial agents including methicillin.

PCR for mecA and blaZ genes

The mecA gene was detected in 3% of the isolates, and the
one S. aureus isolate identiÔ¨Åed from a milkers‚Äô hand also
was mecA positive. Of 104 isolates tested for the blaZ gene,
we found 23 (23%) to carry this gene. Of the 16 MDR

Discussion

In this study, we found high prevalence of S. aureus in
dairy farms as compared to what has been reported in other
parts of the world (Virgin et al., 2009). As S. aureus is a
well-recognized agent of foodborne intoxications, the com-
mon occurrence of this organism in milk could be of public
health concern particularly in this region of Brazil, where
the habit of drinking raw milk is common. Sixteen different
outbreaks of staphylococcal intoxication caused by con-
suming contaminated dairy products were reported in cen-
tral Brazil within a 4-year period between 1998 and 2002
(Veras et al., 2008).

We found anti-microbial resistance commonly to b-
lactams, tetracycline and erythromycin. This Ô¨Ånding is
similar to reports in other parts of the world. However,
the Ô¨Åndings in this study indicated higher frequency of
resistance as compared to previous reports
in Brazil
(Lange et al., 1999; Aires-de-Sousa et al., 2007; Rabello
et al., 2007). The isolates expressed diverse resistance
patterns within farms and between farms. Resistance to
penicillin and ampicillin has been commonly reported in

Staphylococcus
Siqueira-Junior, 1995).

from livestock in Brazil

(Pereira and

Our study showed that 22 of 65 (33%) of S. aureus were
MRSA as conÔ¨Årmed by mecA PCR. This Ô¨Ånding is higher
than previous reports and could be of public health con-
cern considering the high rate of raw milk consumption in
the region. Previous reports showed a 1.3% (Lee, 2003) and
0.15% (Kwon et al., 2005) prevalence rates in Korea.
Another study in South America (Gentilini et al., 2000)
reported that no MRSA detected in a collection of 206
S. aureus isolates identiÔ¨Åed from mastitis cases in dairy
herds, while 3.2% of CoNS showed to be methicillin resis-
tant. No MRSA was detected in dairy farms in Finland
(Pitk‚Ç¨al‚Ç¨a et al., 2004), Korea (Moon et al., 2007) and USA
(Anderson et al., 2006). A recent study reported 4% herd
prevalence of MRSA in bulk tank milk samples in Minne-
sota, USA (Haran et al., 2012); mecA-positive staphylococci
in unpasteurized milk samples were reported at a rate of
7% in United Kingdom (McKay, 2008). However, direct
comparison of prevalence of MRSA reported in different
studies should be considered cautiously as considerable
variations in the study designs exist.

The detection of MRSA in milk has triggered a major
concern about the potential role of MRSA may play as a
foodborne pathogen, especially after
the detection of
LA-MRSA strain in bulk tank milk (Paterson et al., 2012).
It is also noteworthy to mention that the frequency of
MRSA in livestock reported in the last decade might be

MRSA in Brazilian Dairy Farms

biased as novel mechanisms of methicillin resistance in
S. aureus, such as mecC, have recently been reported in dif-
ferent countries, such as France (Laurent et al., 2012) and
Sweden (Unnerstad et al., 2013).

Although the mecA gene is the most common mecha-
nism for methicillin resistance, some of the isolates in the
present study also harboured blaZ gene, responsible for
b-lactamase production that could also play a role in oxa-
cillin resistance. Our observations in the current study
imply that isolates that carried both mecA and blaZ tend to
have a higher spectrum of resistance and are often MDR in
addition to oxacillin than those with only mecA.

and

cephalosporins

The widespread usage of b-lactam agents in local dairy
production for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes
could be the driving force for the common occurrence of
resistance to b-lactam agents such as ampicillin, penicillin
and oxacillin. In the current study, a questionnaire data
were collected in the farms and majority indicated the com-
mon usage of semisynthetic penicillins (benzathine cloxa-
cillin)
(cephalonium dihydrate,
cephapirin benzathine) in the dry-off treatments. Gentami-
cin bromhexine chlorhydrate, tetracycline and spiramycin
with neomycin were commonly reported to be used for the
treatment of clinical mastitis. A previous meta-analysis
study reported a signiÔ¨Åcant association between anti-mi-
crobials exposure and MRSA isolating from human
patients (Tacconelli et al., 2008). In animals, antibiotic use
mainly aminoglycoside has been considered to be a risk fac-
tor for colonization by MRSA in horses (Weese et al.,
2006). Some reports have shown that anti-microbial resis-
tance levels in organic farms are not different from those
found in conventional animal production systems (Roesch
et al., 2006; Thakur et al., 2007).

We found only one hand swab isolate collected from
milkers‚Äô hand that was resistant to methicillin and the iso-
late harboured the mecA gene. However, based on MLST
genotyping the ST, it was distinctly different from what
was found for S. aureus isolated from milk samples from
the same farm. This indicates independent source of con-
tamination between the hand and the milk. Considering
that hand swabs were collected after milking, a contamina-
tion originated from the cow cannot be disregarded.
Although the limited number of observations does not
allow us to take conclusion about
the contamination
routes, the fact that the human S. aureus isolate shared a
common ST type and a similar PFGE pulsotype (Fig. 1)
with one other bovine isolate from a different farm might
indicate the existence of common source MRSA clone(s)
in the region.

Overall, the frequency of MDR Staphylococcus in the cur-
rent study was low as compared to previously reported in
other studies on dairies (Roesch et al., 2006). In this study,
no isolates were found to be resistant to vancomycin.

Subclinical carriers of vancomycin-resistant staphylococci
have been documented in Brazil (Palazzo et al., 2005).

The diverse phenotypic resistance proÔ¨Åles (R-types)
could be linked to the genetic variability of the staphylo-
cocci isolates. Using MLST genotyping, we identiÔ¨Åed 11
different STs among 16 MRSA isolates. Of these, four STs
were reported for the Ô¨Årst time. PFGE discriminated the
MRSA isolates
into four major genotypic clusters at
genetic similarity level of 70%. The high genotypic vari-
ability could be explained by the environment and man-
agement differences among the farms, as extensive or
semi-intensive production systems are often expected to
have diverse genotypes due to their exposure to various
environmental sources. In a previous report about the
characterization of S. aureus causing bovine mastitis in
Rio de Janeiro (Rabello et al., 2007), the sequence types
ST126, ST97 and ST1 were commonly observed. Staphylo-
coccus aureus ST97 found in Brazilian herds has also been
associated with dairy in USA (www.mlst.net). Indeed,
S. aureus causing mastitis in cows that belong to clonal
complex (CC) CC126 and CC97, found in this study, are
also known to be clonally associated with bovine S. aureus
lineage strains worldwide (Smith et al., 2005). According
to a previous study performed in Rio de Janeiro State
(28), most found STs (747, 740, 126 and 751) related to
animal strains, except one isolate from buffalo (ST5),
which has been also isolated from human infections indi-
cating this is may be a common clone among humans and
animals. In summary, the present study indicates a low
prevalence of MRSA among dairy herds in Paraiba State,
Brazil. Although the isolates showed genotypic diversity,
the identiÔ¨Åcation of a common clone to humans and ani-
mals warrants further investigations about the role of mil-
kers in the epidemiology of MRSA in semi-extensive dairy
production systems.
