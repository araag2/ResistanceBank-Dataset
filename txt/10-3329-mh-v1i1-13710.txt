Escherichia coli known to cause food-borne illnesses worldwide that are closely associated with the consumption of conta-
minated poultry and egg products. This study was undertaken for cultural, biochemical and antibiotic sensitivity analyses 
of  E.  coli  recovered  from  apparently  healthy  chickens.  Cloacal  samples  (n=350)  were  aseptically  collected  from  layers 
(n=150), broilers (n=150) and indigenous chickens (n=50). The samples were enriched in nutrient broth and streaked onto 
eosin  methylene  blue  (EMB) agar, MacConkey  (MC) agar,  blood agar, salmonella-shigella  (SS)  agar and brilliant  green 
agar (BGA) for cultural characterization of the E. coli isolates. Culture-positive samples yielded characteristic colonies of 
E. coli  with  metallic  sheen  on  EMB agar, bright  pink  or  red colonies  on MC agar, hemolysis  on  blood agar,  slight  pink 
smooth colonies on SS agar and green color colonies on BGA media. The E. coli isolates produced acid and gas by ferm-
enting sugars (dextrose, sucrose, lactose, maltose and mannitol) and gave positive reaction to indole, methyl red (MR) and 
catalase tests, but were negative to Voges-Proskauer (VP) test. The prevalence of E. coli in layers, broilers and indigenous 
chickens  were 78.67, 82 and  70%,  respectively.  The antibiotic  sensitivity  pattern demonstrated  that E. coli isolates  were 
mostly sensitive to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and cephalexin, and resistant to streptomycin, tetracycline, amoxicillin and 
nalidixic acid.  Data  of this  study  suggested  that  intestine  of chicken could  be a  major  reservoir  of antibiotic  resistant E. 
coli. 

Introduction 
 
Escherichia  coli  are  Gram  negative  bacteria  under  the 
family Enterobacteriaceae. E. coli are widely distributed in 
nature,  being  present  in  soil  and  surface  water  and  in 
animal and human feces. The most important reservoir of 
E.  coli  is  the  intestinal  tract  of  animals  and  poultry 
(Bélanger  et  al.,  2011).  In  addition,  it  is  present  on  the 
bird’s  skin and  feathers.  These  bacteria cause colibacillo-
sis  in  chickens  which  is  characterized  by  air  sacculitis, 
cellulitis, omphalitis, peritonitis, salpingitis, synovitis and 
coligranuloma.  This  disease  has  an  important  economic 
impact on poultry production worldwide. The majority of 
economic losses results from mortality and loss of produc-
tivity of the affected birds (Otaki et al., 1995).  
 
E. coli strains always belong to both pathogenic and non-
pathogenic types (Pupo et al., 1997). In the caecal flora of 
healthy  chickens,  10-15%  of  the  E.  coli  strains  may 
belong  to  an  O-serotype.  As  soon  as  the  first  hour  after 
hatching, the birds start building up their E. coli flora. The

bacteria drastically increase their numbers in the gut. Birds 
may  be  infected  with  E.  coli  from  contaminated  environ-
ment, direct contact with sick birds, feces, water and feed 
(Dho-Moulin et al., 1999). Rodents may act as a carrier of 
avian  pathogenic  E.  coli  (APEC)  and  hence  a  source  of 
contamination for the birds (Barnes et al., 1997). 
 
Most of the strains of E. coli are harmless but some strains 
can cause food poisoning. E. coli food poisoning is usually 
caused by: enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) enterotoxige-
nic E. coli (ETEC); enterinvasive (EIEC) and enterohemo-
rrhagic E. coli (EHEC) (Mead et al., 1999). E. coli enters 
the  body  through  the  consumption  of  food  containing 
bacteria.  Eating  of  inadequately  cooked  meat  is  the  most 
common  way  that  causes  E.  coli  food  poisoning.  Raw 
poultry meat may contain E. coli that can cause food poi-
soning (Gormley et al., 2011). When a chicken is eviscera-
ted,  the  healthy  parts  can  be  easily  contaminated.  Food 
animal  such  as  cattle,  pig  and  chickens  appear  to  be 
reservoir  of  this  organism  (Geser  et al.,  2012). Multidrug 
resistance E. coli are produced due to use of antibiotics in 
animal’s  feeds  as  well  as  incomplete  course  of  treatment 
against E.  coli infection of humans and animals (Marshall 
et  al.,  1990).  The  present  study  was  undertaken  to  deter-
mine  the  prevalence  and  characteristics  of  E.  coli  in 
apparently healthy chickens at farms, live bird markets and 
villages of Mymensingh area in Bangladesh.

Materials and Methods 
 
Sample collection 
Swab  samples  were  aseptically  collected  from  apparently 
healthy  layers  of  Bangladesh  Agricultural  University 
(BAU)  Poultry  Farm  (n=100)  and  Boira  Poultry  Farm 
(n=50),  broilers  at  Kamal  Ranjit  (KR)  market  (n=50), 
BAU  Sesh-more  market  (n=50),  and  Kewatkhali  market 
(n=50)    and  indigenous  chickens  at  Boira  village  (n=50), 
Mymensingh.  Samples  were  obtained  from  16-18  weeks 
old laying hens, 10-12 weeks old broilers and 12-16 weeks 
old indigenous chickens.   
 
Enrichment 
Immediately  after  collection,  samples  were  separately 
enriched in Nutrient Broth (NB) by incubating at 370C for 
overnight. 
 
Isolation of E. coli 
After enrichment in NB, a small amount of inoculum from 
NB  was  streaked  duplicate  onto  eosin  methylene  blue 
(EMB)  agar  media  and  incubated  at  370C  for  overnight 
(Cheesbrough, 1985). 
 
Characterization of E. coli 
Characterization of the E. coli was performed on the basis 
of cultural characteristics, Gram staining, motility test and 
antibiogram profiles. Colonial morphology of E. coli such 
as-  size,  margin,  elevation  and  color  were  recorded  on 
EMB agar, nutrient agar (NA), brilliant green agar (BGA), 
blood agar, salmonella-shigella (SS) agar, triple sugar iron 
(TSI)  agar  and  MacConkey  (MC)  agar  media  to  study 
cultural characteristics (Cheesebourgh,1985). Biochemical 
characterization of E. coli was performed by sugar fermen-
tation  reactions.  Also,  methyl  red-Voges  Proskauer  (MR-
VP), catalase and  indole  tests  were  done according  to  the 
method described by Cowan (1985).  
 
Antibiogram study 
Ten  E. coli  isolates  were  randomly  selected  for antibiotic 
sensitivity  assay.  A  previously  described  modified  disc 
diffusion or Kirby-Bauer method (Bauer et al., 1966) was 
used  to  determine  the  susceptibility  of  E.  coli  isolates 
against  antibiotic  agents.  In  brief,  the  procedure  involved 
measuring  the  diameter  of  the  zone  of  inhibition  that 
results from diffusion of the antimicrobial agents into the 
medium surrounding the disc. The reactions of test organi-
sms  to  each  antibiotic  were  classified  as  sensitive,  inter-
mediate and resistant according to the diameter of zone of 
inhibition recommended by NCCLS (2003). Ten commer-
cially  available  antimicrobial  discs  (Oxoid  Ltd,  Baring-
stoke, Hampshire, England) were used in this study, which 
are  mentioned  with  corresponding  standard  disc  concen-
tration in Table 1.

Results 
 
Prevalence of E. coli  
The overall prevalence was 78.86%. The prevalence of E. 
coli in different chicken lines from all sources in this study 
are presented in Table 2. 
 
Cultural, staining and motility characteristics 
E.  coli  on  EMB  agar  produced  greenish  black  colonies 
with metallic sheen. On MC agar, the colonies were bright 
pink  in  color,  transparent,  smooth and  raised.    Hemolysis 
was  produced  in  blood  agar  media.  Slight  pink  smooth 
colonies  were  seen  on  SS  agar  and  green  color  colonies 
were found on BGA media. The organisms appeared Gram 
negative, small rod shaped and arranged in single, pair or 
short chain. All the isolates were found to be motile.   
 
Biochemical tests 
The  five  basic  sugars  viz.  dextrose,  sucrose,  lactose, 
maltose  and  mannitol  were  fermented  by  all  the  isolates 
with the production of acid and gas. Acid production was 
indicated by  the color  change  from  reddish  to  yellow  and 
the  gas  production  was  seen  by  the  appearance  of  gas 
bubbles in the inverted Durham's tubes. All E. coli isolates 
were catalase, indole and MR positive but VP negative.  
 
Antibiogram profiles 
Antibiotic  sensitivity  tests  of  chicken  E. coli  isolates  rev-
ealed  as  sensitive,  intermediate  and  resistant  profiles 
which are shown in Table 3.

Discussion 
 
In  this  study,  the  overall  prevalence  of  E.  coli  in  chickens 
was  recorded  as  78.86%.  Hossain  et  al.  (2008)  reported 
60% prevalence, whereas Nazir (2004) observed 62.5% pre-
valence  of  E.  coli  in  chickens.  In  another  study,  66.67% 
prevalence of E. coli was noticed in duck (Avishek, 2010).  
 
Antibiotic resistance of E. coli isolates of chickens recorded 
in  this  experiment  might  be  due  to  indiscriminate  use  of 
antibiotics  (Bonnet  et  al.,  2009).  These  drug  resistant  E. 
coli  can be spread in the environment where humans and

animals acquire infections resulting difficulties in treating 
these  cases  (Alexander  et  al.,  2009).  The  prevalence  of 
antibiotic resistant E. coli observed in this study appeared 
to  be  similar  to  several  other  studies  (Khan  et  al.,  2005; 
Nazir et al., 2005). Chicken intestine can serve as a reser-
voir  for  E.  coli  strains  capable  of  causing  extra-intestinal 
infection  in  avian  and  mammalian  hosts  (Ewers  et  al., 
2009).  Clinically,  healthy  chickens  probably  have  zoono-
tic potential since transmission between birds and humans 
via  physical  contact,  contaminated  dust  and  egg  is  possi-
ble.  Feces  tends  to  be  leaked  from  the  carcass  when  the 
evisceration stage itself gives an opportunity for the interi-
or  carcass  to  receive  intestinal  bacteria  (Gormley  et  al., 
2011). Contaminated meat and other foods may play a role 
in the local spread of E. coli strains (Vincent et al., 2010). 
The use of antimicrobial agents in food animal production 
may  cause  emergence  of  antimicrobial  drug-resistant 
strain  of  E.  coli.  Antimicrobial  drug-resistant  E.  coli  was 
reported  in  humans  due  to  the  consumption  of  contami-
nated chicken (Manges et al., 2007). 
 
Conclusion 

 

Data in this study suggested that chickens from farms and 
live  bird  markets  may  act as  major reservoir  of  E. coli  in 
Mymensingh region of Bangladesh. Harmful isolates of E. 
coli might cause food-borne illness and may spread resis-
tance strain in humans following consumption of contami-
nated poultry and poultry by-products.
