With the increase in commercial pig farming, there is a simultaneous increase in the use 
of antibiotics for prophylaxis as well as therapeutics in China. In this study, we evaluated 
the prevalence and resistance diversity of salmonellae isolated from feces of asymptomatic, 
live and slaughtered pigs. We analyzed 1,732 pig fecal samples collected over 8 months, 
at Henan province of China. The salmonellae were isolated and identified by PCR. They 
were serotyped using commercial antisera and assayed for the MIC of 16 antibiotics by 
broth microdilution method. The average prevalence of Salmonella was 19.4% (95% CI: 
17.6–21.4). Large farms (herd size ≥1,000) were found to have a higher prevalence as 
compared  to  the  small-  and  medium-scale  farms  (p  <  0.0001).  The  prevalence  of 
salmonellae in samples collected from the farms [11.77% (95% CI: 10.1–13.6)] and from 
the slaughterhouse [45.23% (95% CI: 40.3–50.30)] was statistically different (p < 0.0001). 
Uncommon serovars of Salmonella such as Agama and common serovars such as Derby 
and Typhimurium were isolated. High resistance (>80%) was recorded toward ciprofloxacin 
(100%), tetracycline (99.4%), doxycycline (97%), sulfamethoxazole (85.8%), ampicillin 
(81.6%), and amoxicillin (80.4%). Multidrug resistance (MDR) to four, five, and seven 
classes of antibiotics was recorded to be approximately 25% in the most prevalent serovar 
like Derby. We conclude that the presence of alarmingly high resistance, toward the critical 
antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams, in large swine farms in China, 
should draw public attention. These results highlight the need for continued antibiotic 
stewardship programs for judicious use of critical antibiotics in animal health as well as 
for producing safe pork.

INTRODUCTION

Fuelled  by  the  rapid  socio-economic  growth  and  urbanization 
of China, the average intake of meat, especially pork, increased 
from  37.1  g/day  in  1992  to  64.3  g/day  per  person  in  2012 
(He  et  al.,  2016).  With  the  population  growth  projected  to 
reach  1.4  billion  in  2020,  the  consumption  of  pork  is  also 
expected  to  surpass  100  g/day  per  person  by  2020  (CIIN, 
2018a).  In  2017,  Henan  province  alone  contributed  over  65 
million  live  pigs,  approximately  20%  of  the  whole  national 
consumption  (CIIN,  2018b).  The  boost  in  pig  production  and 
consumption  in  China  has  indirectly  increased  the  risk  of 
foodborne  zoonoses,  including  salmonellosis.  Previous  studies 
have  shown  that  Salmonella  is  one  of  the  leading  foodborne 
pathogens  on  food  commodities,  meat  in  particular,  and  play 
a  significant  role  for  causing  human  diarrhea  in  China  and 
elsewhere  (Pan  et  al.,  2018,  2019;  Paudyal  et  al.,  2018).

Routine  surveillance  of  potential  hazards  is  essential  to 
minimize  the  risks  of  disease  epidemics  as  well  as  other 
potential  threats  such  as  pathogens  and  antibiotic  resistance 
(AR).  The  finishing  herds  usually  ready  for  slaughter  require 
special  attention  in  the  surveillance  purpose  because  they 
could  disseminate  the  pathogens,  if  any  they  carry  in  the 
gut.  Studies  in  other  parts  of  the  world  have  investigated 
the carriage of salmonellae in apparently healthy, asymptomatic 
pigs  in  the  finishing  herds  (Baptista  et  al.,  2009,  2010,  2011; 
Wilhelm  et  al.,  2012).  There  are  numerous  studies  about 
antibiotic-resistant salmonellae in pigs in China. The prevalence 
of  AR  reported  in  these  studies  varies  greatly  but  generally 
is  reported  toward  critical  drugs,  including  quinolones  and 
cefotaxime  (Bai  et  al.,  2016),  tetracyclines  (Jiu  et  al.,  2017), 
quinolones, and cephalosporins (Jiang et al., 2014) or toward 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,  ampicillin,  and  tetracycline 
(Su  et  al.,  2018).

Pathogens  and  AR  can  arise  from  multiple  sources,  for 
example,  the  endemic  pathogens  circulating  in  the  farm  or 
pathogens  introduced  through  the  feed,  water,  workers,  and 
equipment.  Slaughterhouse  is  one  of  the  most  important  risk 
factors  that  can  act  as  a  mixing  vessel  for  any  kinds  and 
numbers of pathogens including Salmonella present in animals 
collected  from  different  unrelated  farms.  Under  favorable 
circumstances,  such  pathogens  can  be  disseminated  via  the 
meat  to  the  consumers.

topics  are  essential 

Previous  studies  on  similar 

for 
understanding  the  scope  and  magnitude  of  salmonellae 
prevalence,  as  well  as  the  corresponding  AR  crisis  in  China. 
However,  most  of  those  studies  have  focused  on  clinically 
diseased  pigs  or  retail-meat/pork.  The  overall  burden  of 
foodborne pathogens, including Salmonella, plays a significant 
threat  to  food  safety  and  public  health.  Because  Henan 
contributes a major segment of pork production in the Chinese 
national  scenario,  it  is  necessary  to  assess  and  inform  the 
stakeholders on the possible prevalence of zoonotic pathogens 
like  Salmonella  recovered  from  swine  finishing  herds  and 
slaughter facility. Additionally, co-existence of different models 
of  farming  systems,  for  example,  small  households  manual 
farms  with  less  than  100  animals  per  farm  to  large  intensive 

automated  commercial  farms  with  more  than  10,000  animals 
per  farm,  demand  different  strategies  to  prevent  and  curtail 
the  prevalence  of  pathogens  like  Salmonella  and  AR.  With 
an  aim  of  minimizing  these  knowledge  gaps,  we  examined 
the  distribution,  prevalence,  and  AR  patterns  of  Salmonella 
enterica  recovered  from  farms,  and  slaughterhouses  in  Henan 
province,  one  of  the  Chinese  leading  pig/pork  producers.

MATERIALS  AND  METHODS

to  estimate 

This  study  was  carried  out  in  a  cross-sectional  observational 
design, 
the  prevalence  of  various  serovars  
of salmonellae in pig feces. The quantification of the minimum 
inhibitory  concentration  (MIC)  of  16  molecules  belonging  
to  nine  different 
agents  was 
conducted  simultaneously.

Sample Collection
From  March  2017  to  November  2017,  a  total  of  1,732  fecal 
samples (approximately 100 g per animal) were collected from 
randomly  selected  36  small-  and  medium-scale 
farms 
(SMS-farms,  housing  <1,000  head  of  pigs),  nine  large-scale 
farms (housing ≥1,000 head of pigs), and two pig slaughtering 
facilities  at  Henan  province  in  China  (slaughtering  capacity 
of  3,000  heads  of  pigs/day).  In  pig  farms,  1,334  fresh  fecal 
samples (499 from large-scale farms and 835 from SMS-farms) 
were collected from apparently healthy or asymptomatic finishing 
pigs  by  non-invasive  sampling  technique.  In  addition,  a  total 
of  398  rectal 
two 
slaughterhouse facilities. The samples were collected aseptically 
and  processed  on  the  same  day  of  collection.

Isolation and Identification
The primary culture and isolation of the organism were done 
according  to  the  protocol  recommended  by  the  World 
Organization  for  Animal  Health  Terrestrial  Manual  (OIE, 
2016).  This  method  consists  of  pre-enrichment  in  buffered 
peptone  water  (BPW)  followed  by  enrichment  in  modified 
semisolid Rappaport Vassiliadis (MSRV) plate and final isolation 
on xylose lysine deoxycholate (XLD) agar plate. The obtained 
isolates  were  then  confirmed  by  polymerase  chain  reaction 
(PCR).  To  elaborate,  10  g  of  feces  were  added  to  90  ml  of 
BPW  and  incubated  at  37°C  for  18–20  h.  Three  hundred 
microliters  of  thus  incubated  BPW  was  transferred  to  MSRV 
semisolid  agar  plate  and  incubated  at  41.5°C  for  24  h.  An 
opaque  halo  in  the  MSRV  medium  is  indicative  of  growth. 
A  10  μl  loopful  of  the  bacterial  growth  from  MRSV  medium 
was  transferred  to  XLD  agar  plates  using  disposable  sterile 
inoculating  loops  and  these  plates  were  incubated  further  for 
18–20 h at 37°C. Typical round red colonies with black center 
on  XLD  media  were  considered  presumptive  of  salmonellae. 
Other  variant  forms  such  as  transparent  single  colonies, 
transparent  pink  colonies  or  transparent  colorless  colonies 
were  sub-cultured  on  Brilliant  Green  Agar  plates  for  two 
more  times  until  they  were  declared  negative  and  discarded.

Jiang et al. Multidrug Resistant Salmonella in HenanWe  picked  up  three  isolated  pure  colonies  for  each  sample 
and  sub-cultured  them  for  any  mixed  populations.  Upon 
obtaining  homogeneous  colonies  in  all  the  three  plates,  only 
one  pure  isolated  colony  from  the  plate  number  one,  was 
taken  and  purified  further  with  one  more  passage  in  XLD 
plates.  The  pure  colonies  were  then  seeded  in  Luria-Bertani 
(LB)  broth  for  serotyping  and  DNA  extraction  by  boiling 
method.  PCR  using  the  primers  for  amplification  of  the 
enterotoxin  stn  gene  for  the  confirmation  of  the  Salmonella 
was  performed  as  recommended  (Zhu  et  al.,  2015).

Serotyping
The  PCR  confirmed  salmonellae  were  serotyped  according  to 
White-Kauffmann-Le  Minor  scheme  by  slide  agglutination  to 
define  O  and  H  antigens  using  commercial  antisera  (S  &  A 
Reagents Lab, Bangkok, Thailand). Strains that did not express 
phase  2  flagellar  antigen  even  after  three  attempts  of  phase 
inversion  were  considered  monophasic.

Antibiotic Susceptibility Test
The  Salmonella  isolates  were  subjected  to  antibiotic  MIC  assay 
using the broth microdilution method following the recommended 
procedure (CLSI, 2012). Sixteen different molecules of antibiotics 
belonging  to  nine  classes  were  used  for  the  MIC  assay.  The 
cutoff  values  recommended  by  CLSI  (CLSI,  2016)  except  for 
enrofloxacin  (Hao  et  al.,  2013)  and  colistin  (EUCAST,  2019) 
were  used  for  the  categorization  of  the  results  (Figure  1).  The 
intermediate  category  was  merged  with  the  resistant  ones  for 
the  analysis  of  our  data.  The  classes  of  antibiotics  and  the 
MIC range (mg/L) used in our assay included penicillin (ampicillin 
or AMP, 0.5–64); beta-lactams (amoxicillin or AMC, 0.25–128); 
cephems  (cefotaxime  or  TAX,  0.125–128;  ceftriaxone  or  CRO, 
0.125–128);  aminoglycosides  (gentamicin  or  GEN,  0.125–128; 
kanamycin  or  KAN  1–128;  streptomycin  or  STR,  1–128); 

tetracyclines  (tetracycline  or  TET,  0.25–128;  doxycycline  or 
DOX,  0.25–128);  quinolones  (ciprofloxacin  or  CIP,  0.06–16; 
enrofloxacin  or  ENR,  0.06–16);  sulphonamides  (cotrimoxazole 
or COT, 1–512; sulfamethoxazole or SMX, 8–1,024); polypeptide 
(colistin  or  CTE,  0.125–4);  and  phenicols  (chloramphenicol  or 
CHL,  0.5–128;  florfenicol  or  FLO,  0.5–128).

Data Analysis
The  obtained  numerical  data  were  analyzed  using  Student’s 
t-test  and  ANOVA  in  GraphPad  Prism  vs  7  for  Windows 
platform.  The  alpha  (p)  level  of  less  than  0.05  was  considered 
significant  and  they  are  given  as  exact  values.  The  difference 
in  the  prevalence  of  the  two  types  of  farms  (SMS-farms  and 
L-farms) was compared using a two-sample independent t-test. 
A  Chi-square  test  was  used  to  compare  the  prevalence  among 
the L-farms, SMS-farms, and the slaughterhouse. The difference 
in the cumulative prevalence of resistance among the salmonellae, 
isolated from L-farms, SMS-farms, and the slaughterhouse with 
respect  to  the  individual  antibiotic  agent  was  compared  using 
two-way  ordinary  ANOVA.

RESULTS

Prevalence and Serovar Distribution
During the sampling period of 8 months (March to November 
2017),  a  total  of  1,732  fecal  samples  (398  from  the  rectum  of 
slaughtered  pigs  and  1,334  from  live  pigs)  were  collected  and 
analyzed.  The  spatial  distribution  of  these  sampling  sites  is 
shown  in  the  geographical  map  of  Henan  in  Figure  2.  This 
distribution  shows  that  our  sampling  frame  covered  a  larger 
geographical  area  within  Henan;  hence,  we  believe  that  these 
results  are  representative  of  the  total  population.  A  total  of 
337 samples (180 rectal samples collected at the slaughterhouse,

samples, while serovars like Agama and Agona, were isolated 
only from the farm samples. Serovars Bovismorbificans, Derby, 
Emek,  Newlands,  Rissen,  and  Typhimurium  were  isolated 
from  both 
total  positive  
isolates  (n  =  337),  serovar  Derby  was  the  most  prevalent 
(26.1%,  n  =  88)  in  the  samples  from  the  slaughterhouse, 
Typhimurium  was  more  prevalent  (16%,  n  =  54)  in  the 
farms’  samples.  The  spatial  (farms  and  slaughterhouses)

Antibiotic Resistance and Multidrug 
Resistance Pattern
Broth microdilution MIC assay was performed for 16 antibiotic 
agents  of  nine  different  classes.  The  prevalence  of  resistance 
among  Salmonella  isolates  against  the  different  classes  of 
antibiotics  is  shown  in  Figure  3B.  Notable  was  the  presence 
of high resistance toward some clinically important antibiotics 
such  as  fluoroquinolones  and  beta-lactams.  Low  resistance 
rates  (<3%)  against  cephems  and  colistin  were  recorded.  The 
overall  distribution  of  the  MIC  values  for  these  antibiotics  is 
shown  in  the  squashtogram  in  Figure  1.  The  results  showed 
that  this  difference  in  the  overall  average  resistance  among 
the sampling sites (L-farms, SMS-farms or SH) was statistically 
significant  (p  =  0.0128),  whereas  the  difference  in  resistance 
to individual antibiotic agents was statistically highly significant, 
p  <  0.0001  (Figure  4).

The  resistance  among  the  serovars 

isolated  from  the 
slaughterhouse  samples  was  compared  for  further  analysis.  It 
was  seen  that  while  the  resistance  among  the  serovars  was 
statistically  significant  (p  =  0.001),  the  difference  among  the 
antibiotics  was  highly  significant  (p  <  0.0001)  (Figure  5A). 
When the resistance between two types of farms were compared, 
variation  in  the  resistance  among  the  serovars  was  statistically 
non-significant  (p  =  0.2984),  whereas  the  variation  between 
the  individual  antibiotics  was  statistically  highly  significant 
(p  <  0.0001)  (Figure  5B).

The  tetra-,  penta-,  and  hepta-drug  resistance  patterns  were 
analyzed  for  the  isolates  shown  in  Figure  6A.  Tetra-resistance 
pattern  (ASSuT,  i.e.,  resistance  to  ampicillin,  streptomycin, 
sulfamethoxazole,  and  tetracycline)  was  the  most  frequently 
(maximum  of  25.8%  for  Derby)  seen  among  the  serovars. 
Penta-drug 
i.e.,  ASSuT  with 
chloramphenicol) was highest (23.4%) for serovar Derby. Hepta-
drug resistance (i.e., ACSSuT with amoxicillin and ceftriaxone) 
was  recorded  only  in  serovar  Typhimurium  (1.8%).

(ACSSuT, 

The  multidrug  resistance  (MDR)  patterns  were  also 
compared  in  relation  to  the  origin  of  the  isolates  (L-farms, 
SMS-farms,  and  slaughterhouses).  The  tetra-  and  penta-drug 
resistance  patterns  were  high  (>50%) 
for 
Typhimurium  and  high  (43%)  in  SMS-farms  for  Derby. 
Uncommon serovars like Agama (only on L-farms) and Emek 
(only  on  SMS-farms)  were  100%  MDR  (Figure  6B).  The 
prevalence  of  tetra-  and  penta-resistance  patterns  in  the 
serovars  isolated  from  slaughterhouse  was  more  than  40% 
except  in  serovar  Rissen  (Figure  6C).

87  samples  from  large-scale  farms,  and  70  from  SMS-farms’ 
fresh fecal samples) tested positive for Salmonella. The average 
prevalence  of  Salmonella  was  19.4%  (95%  CI:  17.6–21.4)  in 
this  study  (337  positives  out  of  1,732  samples,  Table  1).  The 
isolates  belonged  to  10  different  types  of  serovars.

The  difference  in  the  prevalence  of  salmonellae  isolates 
from  the  fecal  samples  collected  at  the  farms  [11.77,  95% 
CI:  10.1–13.6  (n  =  157,  N  =  1,334)]  and  at  slaughterhouse 
[45.23 95% CI: 40.3–50.30 (n = 180, N = 398)] was compared 
using the two-sample independent t-test. The analysis showed 
that  the  higher  prevalence  in  slaughterhouse  samples  was 
statistically  significant  (p  <  0.0001).  Among  the  45  farms 
included  in  the  study,  nine  farms  were  large  commercial 
farms  (L-farms)  with  ≥1,000  heads  of  live  pigs  while  36 
were small- and medium-scale farms (SMS-farms) with <1,000 
heads  of  live  pigs.  The  prevalence  of  salmonellae  in  L-farms 
was  17.43%  (95%  CI:  14.2–21.1),  whereas  in  SMS-farms,  it 
was  8.38%  (95%  CI:  6.6–10.5).  The  results  showed  that  the 
higher prevalence in L-farms is statistically highly significant 
(p  <  0.0001).  The  comparison  of  prevalence  among  the 
L-farms,  SMS-farms,  and  the  slaughterhouses  revealed  that 
the  difference  in  prevalence  among  these  was  statistically 
significant  (p  <  0.0001).

We  differentiated  10  various  serotypes  of  salmonellae  in 
the  total  337  positive  isolates.  The  distribution  of  these 
serovars at different sampling sites is given in Table 1. Among 
the  total  samples  collected  (n  =  1,732),  Derby  was  the  most 
prevalent  serovar  (8.14%,  n  =  141)  while  the  least  prevalent 
one  was  serovar  Agama  (0.06%,  n  =  1).  Serovars  such  as 
Chester and London were isolated only from the slaughterhouse

DISCUSSION

China  produces  and  consumes  more  than  half  (at  about  500 
million heads per annum) of the global pork demand (Larson, 
2015).  Henan  is  one  of  the  largest  pig  producing  provinces 
of China. There are more than 3,000 farms (rearing 100–10,000 
heads  of  pigs)  contributing  almost  62%  of  the  production, 
while  approximately  583  farms  with  a  herd  size  of  more  than 
10,000 contribute around 18% of the production (CIIN, 2018b). 

Pigs  and  pork  from  Henan  are  also  distributed  to  other 
neighboring  provinces  like  Zhejiang,  Shanghai,  Anhui,  and 
Shanxi or to the south as far as Guangdong. These distribution 
channels also serve as a conduit for the transmission of pathogens 
as  well  as  antibiotic-resistant  strains  from  the  farms  to  the 
distributors  and  the  consumers.  Thus,  the  prevalence  of  the 
pathogen  in  Henan  pig/pork  not  only  has  a  local  but  also 
widespread regional implication. Numerous earlier studies have 
reported  on  the  spatiotemporal  variation  of  the  prevalence  of

across  China  (Yan  et  al.,  2010;  Li  et  al.,  2013,  2014;  Lai  et  al., 
2014;  Bai  et  al.,  2015;  Kuang  et  al.,  2015;  Cai  et  al.,  2016;  Jiu 
et  al.,  2017;  Xu  et  al.,  2017;  Yi  et  al.,  2017;  Su  et  al.,  2018). 
These  studies  suggested  that  pathogenic  bacteria  from  animals 
can transmit AR determinants to strains isolated from humans.
In  this  study,  the  prevalence  of  the  serovar  Derby  was  the 
highest  (41%,  141/337).  An  earlier  study  from  Henan  which 
analyzed  eviscerated  pig  carcass  swab  samples  reported  that 
S.  Typhimurium  was  the  most  prevalent  serovar  followed  by 
Derby  (Bai  et  al.,  2015),  whereas  another  study  showed  that 
Derby  was  the  most  prevalent  serovars  in  pork  (Zhu  et  al., 
2019).  For  a  comparison,  serovar  Typhimurium  ranked  first 
and Derby ranked the third most frequent cause of non-typhoidal 
salmonellosis  in  human  patients  in  Henan  (Xia  et  al.,  2009). 
There  are  no  reports  on  the  presence  of  serovars  such  as 
Agama  and  Chester  in  Henan  pigs,  until  date.  Serovar  Derby

slaughterhouses (SH).

has  also  been  reported  to  have  the  highest  prevalence  in  the 
pig/pork  from  Jiangsu  (Li  et  al.,  2014)  or  from  Sichuan  (Li 
et al., 2013). Jiangsu and Henan are the neighboring provinces 
and  there  is  the  trade  of  pig/pork  between  these  two  places. 
Sichuan  is  one  of  the  top  producers  of  pig/pork  in  China.  It 
has  multiple  inter-provincial  trades,  which  are  likely  linked  to 
each  other  along  the  pork  value  chain.

The  prevalence  of  salmonellae  was  higher  in  large  farms 
as compared to smaller farms and the difference was statistically 
significant. Common knowledge dictates that larger farms have 
stronger  biosecurity  measures  and  generally  implement  good 
farming practices, which should have minimized the prevalence 
of  pathogens.  However,  the  farm  level  prevalence  is  a  multi-
factorial outcome and factors such as stocking density, endemic 
contamination  of  the  farm,  histories  of  infection  in  the  past, 
and  flawed  biosecurity  measures  could  all  be  responsible  for 
this  increased  prevalence.  Antibiotics  are  frequently  used  to 
act as insurance to prevent a disease epidemic that is associated 
with overcrowding and poor sanitation in pig production. This 
can  lead  to  lower  apparent  prevalence  but  probable  longer 
shedding stage (Patterson et al., 2016) and increased resistance 
in  small  farms,  which  is  evident  in  our  analysis.  The  situation 
is further exacerbated because some antibiotics are widely used 
as  a  feed  supplement  primarily  for  growth  stimulation.  This 
could  be  the  prime  reason  for  the  presence  of  almost  similar 
prevalence  rates  of  resistance  to  multiple  antibiotics  in  the 
SMS-  and  large  farms.

In  our  analysis,  samples  collected  from  the  rectum  of  the 
slaughtered  pigs  had  a  higher  prevalence  of  salmonellae  as 
compared  to  the  fresh  fecal  samples  collected  on  the  farm. 
The  slaughterhouses  from  where  the  samples  were  collected 
for  this  study,  provided  service  to  multiple  farms  (even  those 
beyond our sampling frame) throughout Henan. It was reported 
earlier  that  in  apparently  healthy  flocks  harboring  Salmonella, 
5–30%  of  the  animals  may  still  excrete  the  bacteria  at  the 
end of the finishing period which could probably double during 
transport  and  lairage  (Berends  et  al.,  1996).  Stress  due  to 
transportation, along with a number of factors like environmental

affect  the  pathogen  secretion  during  lairage  and  subsequent 
slaughter  (Simons  et  al.,  2016).

The presence of less common serovars such as Agama (n = 1), 
Agona  (n  =  2),  and  Emek  (n  =  3)  in  our  study  shows  that 
pigs  not  only  contribute  specific  pathogenic  serovars  such  as 
Typhimurium  or  Derby  to  humans  but  also  harbor  atypical 
strains.  These  atypical  strains  also  showed  higher  levels  of 
resistance  for  most  of  the  common  antibiotics  used  in  pig 
husbandry in Henan. This is of concern because atypical strains, 
which  are  apparently  harmless  to  pigs  or  humans,  under  the 
selective  pressure  of  different  antibiotics  used  in  pig  husbandry 
could  play  a  significant  role  in  the  transmission  of  resistance 
to  other  pathogenic  strains.  Increase  in  AMR  genes  under 
selective  pressure  in  swine  fed  with  medicated  feed  has  been 
previously  reported  (Looft  et  al.,  2012).  Currently,  there  are 
more than 20 classes of antibiotics with over 100 generic molecules 
but  not  all  are  equally  used  in  animal  husbandry  (Zhang  et  al., 
2015).  Antibiotics  are  usually  incorporated  in  animal  feed  at 
low  concentrations  (2.5–125  mg/kg)  as  growth  promoters  
for  an  undefined  time  period  (Marshall  and  Levy,  2011).  

An  earlier  report  on  a  survey  of  60  pig  farms  of  various  sizes 
during  2007–2008  in  Henan  province  suggested  that  antibiotics 
were  used  in  all  stages  of  pig  production,  from  weaning,  to 
growing and fattening, as additives in animal feed, via drinking 
water  or  individual  injection.  The  major  classes  of  antibiotics 
used  were  tetracyclines,  penicillins,  sulfonamides,  ceftiofur,  and 
florfenicol  (Zhang  et  al.,  2015;  Wu,  2018).

these  MDR 

The  occurrence  of  tetra-  or  penta-drug  resistance  in  high 
frequency  in  the  serovars  Derby  and  Typhimurium  decrease 
the  chances  of  success  of  therapeutics  at  the  farm  level.  The 
carriage  of 
(ASSuT,  ACSSuT,  or 
ACSSuTAmcCro)  by  the  pigs  could  potentially  contaminate 
the downstream along the slaughter-chain. As the Henan pigs/
pork  are  distributed  over  wider  geography  in  China,  this  can 
eventually lead to a spread of the resistance strains throughout 
the  pig/pork  food  chain.

Our  results  showed  that  the  effect  of  the  sampling  site  had 
a  significant  influence  on  the  prevalence  of  resistant  bacteria. 
A study from southern China reported that in typical large-scale 
commercial pig farms, the most frequently used “in feed” antibiotics 
were tetracyclines, bacitracin, or sulfonamides (Zhou et al., 2013).

Jiang et al. Multidrug Resistant Salmonella in HenanYet  another  analysis  from  2015  reported  that  in  the  various 
regions  of  China,  amoxicillin  had  the  largest  use  in  animals  as 
well  as  in  humans,  whereas  florfenicol  and  quinolones  were  the 
most common antibiotics used in pig farms (Zhang et al., 2015). 
We  can,  therefore,  infer  that  there  is  a  high  selection  pressure 
of  antibiotics  in  the  swine  gut  thereby  causing  the  appearance 
of high resistance to common “in feed” or therapeutic antibiotics 
such as sulfa-trimethoprim, tetracyclines, amoxicillin, ampicillin, 
and  chloramphenicol.  The  antibiotic  use  in  animal  production 
is  a  key  contributor  to  the  growth  of  animal  production  to 
ensuring food security in China over the last four decades (Wu, 
2018).  This  usage  rate  has  also  increased  with  the  expansion  of 
animal production and with more intensive livestock production. 
This  has  inadvertently  led  to  an  increase  in  the  risk  of  zoonotic 
pathogens such as Salmonella with high MDR capable of emergence 
and  dissemination  via  the  food  systems.

Unlike earlier studies that reported the presence of increasing 
levels of resistance by salmonellae to cephems class of antibiotics 
(Jiu  et  al.,  2017),  the  strains  in  our  collection  were  highly 
susceptible to this class of antibiotic. This finding is in accordance 
with regional differences and variations in the selection pressure 
on  different  farms  (Zhou  et  al.,  2013;  Collignon  and  Voss, 
2015).  The  resistance  of  atypical  strains  such  as  Agama  to  all 
other  classes  of  antibiotics  except  the  cephems  is  also  an 
interesting finding in the sense that this serovar is not generally 
associated with mammals but rather with reptiles and amphibians. 
Its  presence  and  the  general  resistance  is  a  matter  of  concern 
and  further  assessments.

CONCLUSION

The  prevalence  of  salmonellae  isolates  differed  significantly 
according  to  the  farm  size,  with  large  farms  having  more 
salmonellae as compared to the small farms with the maximum 
prevalence in the slaughterhouse samples. The presence of high 
level  of  resistance  to  critical  antibiotics  such  as  quinolones 
and beta-lactams in the various serovars of salmonellae isolated 
from apparently healthy/slaughtered pigs possibly illustrates the 
risk  of  acquisition  and  dissemination  of  such  MDR  via  the 
pork  food  chain.  Presence  of  highly  MDR  atypical  serovars 

exacerbates  this  risk  even  further  as  they  might  be  acting  as 
the  “dark  matters”  for  the  resistance  (Paudyal  and  Yue,  2019). 
This  could  eventually  lead  to  therapeutic  failures  in  animals 
as  well  as  humans  even  for  the  clinically  critical  antibiotics.
