ABSTRACT

This  study  aimed  to  determine  the  major  diseases, 
antimicrobial  use,  and  resistance  in  commensal  Esch-
erichia coli in dairy cattle in Jordan. Forty-three (large, 
n  =  21;  small,  n  =  22)  farms  were  surveyed.  A  vali-
dated questionnaire was administered to the herdsmen 
to elicit information about disease prevalence, antimi-
crobial knowledge, and antimicrobial use. In addition, 
fecal  samples  were  collected  from  5  lactating  animals 
on each farm. A total of 520 E. coli isolates were tested 
for  resistance  to  12  antimicrobials.  From  the  herds-
men’s perspective, the diseases that require use of vet-
erinary services in large and small production systems 
were mastitis (51.2%), metritis (51.2%), and enteritis 
(39.5%), and the most commonly used antimicrobials 
were oxytetracycline and streptomycin. Dairy herdsmen 
(83.7%) reported that it is easy to purchase antimicro-
bials  without  a  veterinary  prescription  and  97.7%  of 
them more frequently changed the antimicrobial drug 
rather  than  increasing  the  dose  when  presented  with 
nonresponse to treatment. Escherichia coli isolates ex-
hibited high resistance to streptomycin (47.5%), tetra-
cycline (45.4%), and ampicillin (34.2%). Less than 10% 
of isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol, kanamy-
cin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone. Overall, 
64.6 and 37.1% of the E. coli isolates exhibited resis-
tance to ≥1 antimicrobial and multidrug resistance (re-
sistance to ≥3 antimicrobial classes), respectively. The 
isolates exhibited 107 antimicrobial resistance profiles. 
This study indicates that antimicrobials are frequently 
misused in dairies in Jordan and that resistance among 
commensal E. coli toward antimicrobials of human and 
veterinary  importance  is  high.  Therefore,  educational 
programs  for  herdsmen  and  enacting  regulations  and

guidelines are necessary to promote the judicious use of 
antimicrobials in dairy animals in Jordan.

INTRODUCTION

The emergence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens 
compromises  the  effectiveness  of  clinical  treatment  of 
human  and  animal  infectious  diseases  and  has  major 
global  public  health  and  negative  economic  impacts 
(File et al., 2014; Friedman et al., 2016). Inappropriate 
antimicrobial  use  in  human  and  veterinary  medicine 
selects for resistance in bacterial pathogens, and some 
of these pathogens are zoonotic and can be transmitted 
from  animals  to  humans  (Leverstein-van  Hall  et  al., 
2011;  Landers  et  al.,  2012).  Antimicrobial  resistance 
is  a  worldwide  problem  and  exists  in  both  resource-
rich and resource-poor settings. This problem, however, 
might  be  more  severe  in  developing  countries  due  to 
less-restricted availability and use of antimicrobials in 
food animal production (WHO, 2014).

 

Studying  antimicrobial  resistance  in  commensal 
bacteria  is  valuable  as  these  bacteria  can  serve  as 
reservoirs  for  resistance  genes  and  can  transfer  these 
genes to pathogenic bacteria (DeFrancesco et al., 2004; 
EFSA,  2008).  Antimicrobial  resistance  in  commensal 
bacteria  is  positively  correlated  with  local  antimicro-
bial selective pressure and may be a risk for developing 
antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic bacteria (Hao et 
al., 2014). Thus, frequent monitoring of antimicrobial 
resistance  in  bacterial  isolates  from  animals  can  help 
detect  emerging  antimicrobial-resistant  phenotypes  in 
commensal  and  pathogenic  bacteria  within  the  food 
production chain.

Concerns  about  antimicrobial  resistance  led  to  the 
launching of surveillance and monitoring programs in 
resource-rich countries such as the United States, Can-
ada, Denmark, France, Sweden, and Norway (NORM/
NORM-VET,  2010;  RESAPATH,  2012;  CIPARS, 
2013;  DANMAP,  2014;  SWEDRES/SWEDVARM,

OBAIDAT ET AL.

2014; ECDC, 2015; NARMS, 2015). However, data on 
nonprescription antimicrobial treatment of livestock in 
resource-poor countries such as Jordan are lacking. Al-
though Jordan relies on beef importation to satisfy its 
domestic meat demand, dairy cattle are a major com-
ponent of the Jordanian animal industry and 2 dairy 
production  systems  exist  in  Jordan:  large  and  small 
scale. Large intensive production systems use modern 
management practices with zero-grazing and minimum 
separation between lactating and nonlactating cows in 
the same farm. These farms are predominantly located 
in the Al-Dulial area, which produces around 50% of 
the country’s milk (DoS, 2015). Small-scale production 
systems  are  scattered  in  different  regions  of  Jordan, 
mainly in the Highland area. In this system, cows are 
housed in small, traditional brick barns, with no sepa-
ration among cows, and herdsmen use more traditional 
management practices than in the large systems. Both 
systems raise Holstein-Friesian dairy cows and together 
contribute  US$160  million  annually  to  the  national 
gross domestic product (DoS, 2015).

To  better  define  the  use  of  antimicrobials  in  dairy 
production systems in Jordan, we surveyed dairy farms 
and  sampled  dairy  cattle  feces  to  investigate  disease 
incidence  and  antimicrobial  treatment  practices  and 
to estimate the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance 
among fecal Escherichia coli. In addition, we compared 
large and small dairy farms with respect to the above 
parameters.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Farm and Animal Selection

Forty-three farms (21 large farms from intensive pro-
duction systems in Al-Dulail area and 22 small farms 
from small-scale production systems in the Highlands) 
were selected and visited in 2015. Large production sys-
tems had >50 cows per farm, whereas the small-scale 
production systems had <50 cows per farm.

From each farm, 5 lactating cows that were 2 to 5 yr 
of age and had no antimicrobial treatment within the 
last  2  wk  were  eligible  for  inclusion  and  sampled.  In 
each farm, the number of cows from a sampling frame 
of all cows meeting these inclusion criteria was divided 
by 5 (total number of cows/5 = k) and every kth cow 
was  sampled.  To  prevent  selection  bias,  neither  indi-
vidual disease history nor milk production performance 
was known for the sampled animals. From our pretest 
activities,  we  found  that  herdsmen  were  unwilling  to 
allow  researchers  to  sample  more  than  about  5  cows 
because  they  did  not  want  researchers  to  spend  long 
periods of time on their farms.

Sampling Approach

In each area, designated and trained practicing vet-
erinarians  were  recruited  to  assist  with  questionnaire 
data  and  sample  collection  because  they  have  strong 
ties  with  the  herdsmen  (their  clients),  are  from  the 
same community, and speak the same dialect. This ap-
proach allowed access to the selected farms and helped 
ensure the accuracy of the questionnaire. To encourage 
voluntary  participation  from  herdsmen,  government 
veterinarians  did  not  participate  in  the  study.  The 
herdsmen were briefed about the study objectives, as-
sured  that  the  study  was  only  for  research  purposes, 
and that any generated data from their specific farm 
would be available to them upon request. Consent to 
conduct  interviews  and  collect  samples  was  obtained 
from the herdsman at each farm before beginning the 
study.

Questionnaire

A  modified  questionnaire  based  on  Redding  et  al. 
(2014) was developed and used in this study to inter-
view the herdsmen. The questionnaire was developed in 
Arabic, and then pretested with a convenience sample 
of  herdsmen  from  3  large  and  3  small  farms.  Neces-
sary revisions were made before the questionnaire was 
finalized.  The  repeatability  of  the  questionnaire  was 
examined by asking the same farmers the questions in 
2 ways: during a face-to-face interview and by phone 
call.  Then,  repeatability  was  determined  by  calculat-
ing the agreement between answers to 4 questions: (1) 
What do you do for animals that receive antimicrobial 
treatment? (2) Do you obtain prescriptions before ad-
ministering  antimicrobials  to  your  animals?  (3)  Does 
the  veterinarian  examine  the  diseased  animals  before 
prescribing  antimicrobials?  (4)  Do  you  use  antimi-
crobials  for  growth  promotion?  The  kappa  scores  for 
each question were 0.94 (very good), 0.90 (very good), 
0.86  (very  good),  and  0.83  (very  good),  respectively. 
The  questionnaire  was  divided  into  3  major  sections 
to  capture  overall  (1)  farm  management,  (2)  diseases 
of  concern,  and  (3)  antimicrobial  use.  The  herdsmen 
were also asked to list the importance of several factors 
that they use before choosing an antimicrobial, includ-
ing price, quality, brand, packaging, ease of acquisition, 
experience with the drug, and recommendation of the 
veterinarian or drug store vendor.

Commensal E. coli Isolation and Identification

Fecal samples (10 g) were collected with a clean rec-
tal sleeve from the distal rectum of each individual cow

and placed into sterile containers that were labeled and 
kept on ice until delivered to the Food Hygiene Labo-
ratories, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Jordan Uni-
versity of Science and Technology (Irbid) for analysis. 
Samples from 5 animals were taken from each farm and 
labeled with a unique identifier. A new rectal sleeve was 
used  for  each  animal  to  prevent  cross-contamination 
among the samples.

Escherichia coli was isolated from the fecal samples 
using  a  standard  protocol  as  follows.  Briefly,  10  g  of 
each  fecal  sample  was  mixed  with  225  mL  of  0.1% 
peptone water. Then, 20 mL of the fecal mixture was 
mixed with 20 mL of double-strength MacConkey broth 
(Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, UK) and incubated at 35°C 
for  24  h.  The  broth  culture  was  then  streaked  onto 
MacConkey agar (Oxoid) and incubated at 35°C for 24 
h. Suspected E. coli (pink) colonies were streaked onto 
eosin methylene blue plates (Oxoid) and incubated at 
35°C for 24 h. Metallic green colonies were considered 
presumptive E. coli and were streaked onto trypticase 
soy agar (Oxoid) and tested for indole and oxidase pro-
duction. Suspect (indole-positive and oxidase-negative) 
isolates were confirmed by PCR targeting the E. coli 
translation  elongation  factor  EF-Tu  (tuf)  gene  using 
the same primers and cycling conditions as previously 
described  (Maheux  et  al.,  2009).  Confirmed  E.  coli 
isolates were banked in trypticase soy broth with 20% 
buffered glycerol at −70°C for later antimicrobial resis-
tance testing.

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing

Pure  frozen  cultures  were  grown  on  trypticase  soy 
agar overnight at 37°C and adjusted to a 0.5 McFarland 
turbidity in 5-mL sterile normal saline tubes. Isolates 
were screened for susceptibility to a panel of 12 anti-
microbials on Mueller-Hinton agar (Oxoid) by the disk 
diffusion method, as described by the National Com-
mittee  for  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards  (CLSI, 
2014) guidelines. The following disks (Oxoid) were used: 
β-lactams  (ampicillin,  10  μg;  amoxicillin-clavulanic 
acid, 30 μg; cephalothin, 30 μg; and ceftriaxone, 30 μg), 
aminoglycosides  (gentamicin,  10  μg;  streptomycin,  10 
μg; and kanamycin, 50 μg); quinolones (ciprofloxacin, 5 
μg; nalidixic acid, 30 μg), phenicols (chloramphenicol, 
30  μg),  tetracyclines  (tetracycline,  30  μg),  and  folate 
pathway  inhibitors  (sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, 
25 μg). Isolates with intermediate susceptibility to the 
tested  antimicrobials  were  considered  “susceptible” 
for  analysis  purposes.  Escherichia  coli  ATCC  25922 
and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 were used as 
reference strains for the disk diffusion method quality 
control. An isolate was considered resistant when it was 

resistant to ≥1 antimicrobials and multidrug resistant 
when  it  was  resistant  to  ≥3  classes  of  antimicrobials 
(Magiorakos et al., 2012).

Data Analysis

Data  were  entered  in  Excel  (Microsoft  Corp.,  Red-
mond, WA) and analyzed using MedCalc for Windows 
(version  17.9;  MedCalc  Software,  Ostend,  Belgium). 
Chi-squared  and  Fisher’s  exact  tests  were  used  as 
appropriate  to  assess  the  differences  in  each  variable 
of  interest  (antimicrobial  resistance  outcome  or  ques-
tionnaire  variables)  independently  between  large  and 
small farms (Pagano and Gauvreau, 2000; Deeks and 
Higgins, 2010). Odd ratios were used to determine the 
association  between  farm-level  antimicrobial  use  and 
resistance among fecal E. coli isolates.

RESULTS

Disease Incidence and Use of Veterinary Services

The response rate for this study was 98%, with only 
one  farmer  declining  to  participate.  Overall,  51.2% 
of  the  dairy  herdsmen  reported  clinical  mastitis,  and 
the same number reported metritis as frequent animal 
health concerns that require veterinary service, followed 
by dystocia (41.9%), enteritis (39.5%), and respiratory 
infections (27.9%; Table 1). However, herdsmen in large 
dairy farms reported mastitis and metritis more than 
herdsmen in small farms and this was statistically sig-
nificant  (P  =  0.01).  Lameness,  left-displaced  aboma-
sum, and bloat were also reported by herdsmen in large 
dairy  farms,  and  dystocia  was  reported  by  81.1%  of 
herdsmen in small dairy farms (Table 1). We detected 
no significant differences between large and small farms 
in reporting enteritis and pneumonia. All of the dairy 
herdsmen reported using veterinary services; 19% of the 
large dairy farms and none of the small farms reported 
having a resident veterinarian (Table 1).

Acquisition of Antimicrobials

Antimicrobials were obtained from 3 sources in Jor-
dan:  veterinary  drug  stores,  Ministry  of  Agriculture 
(MOA)  offices,  and  practicing  veterinarians.  Among 
the  herdsmen  (n  =  43)  interviewed,  79.1%  reported 
obtaining  antimicrobials  from  veterinary  drug  stores, 
27.9% from field veterinarians, and 16.3% from MOA 
offices.  However,  one  large  farm  reported  obtain-
ing  antimicrobials  directly  from  the  manufacturers. 
In  addition,  83.7%  of  herdsmen  reported  that  it  was 
easy  to  purchase  antimicrobials  without  a  veterinary

prescription.  Among  herdsmen,  46.5%  reported  that 
the  veterinarian  always  examined  the  animals  before 
antimicrobial treatment, and 32.6% reported that they 
always obtained a prescription. However, 53.5% of the 
herdsmen  reported  that  their  veterinarian  sometimes 
examined  the  animal  before  antimicrobial  treatment 
and  67.4%  reported  that  they  usually  obtained  pre-
scriptions before purchasing antimicrobials (Table 1).

The herdsmen considered different factors when pur-
chasing antimicrobials but, in most cases (60.4%), price 
was the most important factor, followed by veterinary 
recommendations, and then experience. Packaging was 
the least important factor considered.

Antimicrobial Use

The most commonly used antimicrobials on the dairy 
farms were oxytetracycline, penicillin G with streptomy-
cin,  gentamicin,  and  sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. 
Less  commonly  used  antimicrobials  were  amoxicillin, 
tylosin, marbofloxacin, and ceftiofur. Use of tilmicosin, 
alamycin,  and  lincomycin/spectinomycin  was  rarely 
reported (Table 2).

The  dairy  cattle  diseases  most  commonly  treated 
with  antimicrobials  on  Jordanian  dairy  farms  were 
mastitis,  metritis,  enteritis,  and  respiratory  diseases. 
Mastitis was treated with intramammary infusions of 
amoxicillin (69.7%), followed in frequency by parenteral 
administration  of  oxytetracycline  (60.6%)  and  genta-
micin  (42.4%).  Oxytetracycline  was  used  significantly 
more  frequently  (P  ≤  0.05)  on  large  than  on  small 
farms  (Table  2).  In  general,  metritis  was  primarily 

treated with ceftiofur (75% of the cases) and in some 
cases with tylosin (37.5%). Enteritis was treated with 
antimicrobials and in most cases by sulfamethoxazole-
trimethoprim (94.1%). Respiratory diseases, including 
pneumonia, were treated with antimicrobials; the 3 ma-
jor  antimicrobials  used  were  oxytetracycline  (24.3%), 
oxytetracycline with tylosin (27.0%), and marbofloxa-
cin (32.4%). Other antimicrobials were rarely used in 
treating the 4 major diseases outlined in Table 2.

Antimicrobials  were  used  primarily  for  therapeutic 
purposes;  however,  a  few  (16.3%)  of  the  herdsmen 
reported  using  antimicrobials  for  growth  promotion 
in  calves,  including  oxytetracycline  (7.0%)  and  sulfa-
methoxazole-trimethoprim (7.0%). The latter practice 
was significantly more frequent in the large dairy farms 
than  on  the  small  farms.  On  the  other  hand,  90.7% 
of the herdsmen reported the use of antimicrobials for 
prevention,  specifically  for  dry  cow  therapy  (51.2%), 
and prophylactically when other animals are sick in the 
farm (53.5%; Table 3). Large dairy farms in Al-Dulail 
practiced  dry  cow  therapy  (76.2%)  significantly  more 
frequently than the farms in small-scale production sys-
tems (27.3%). Interestingly, all farms in the small-scale 
production systems reported administering antimicro-
bials to healthy cows prophylactically when other cows 
were  sick;  however,  very  few  herdsmen  reported  this 
practice in the large production systems (Table 3).

Management of Antimicrobial Treatments

Most  herdsmen  (74.4%)  reported  marking  recently 
treated  animals  for  identification,  but  this  was  sig-

nificantly more frequent among large farms than small 
farms. In general, 40.9% of herdsmen reported milking 
treated animals last. Most herdsmen (97.7%) reported 
changing the antimicrobial, rather than increasing the 
dose, when it did not appear to be effective before com-
pleting the treatment course. Most (95.3%) herdsmen 
also reported feeding the milk of treated cows to calves 
for 3 to 5 d rather than discarding it (Table 4).

Antimicrobial Resistance of Commensal E. coli

All  farms,  both  large  and  small,  had  at  least  one 
animal carry antibiotic-resistant E. coli. However, 89.5 
and  89.1%  of  individual  animals  in  large  and  small 
farms; respectively, shed antibiotic-resistant E. coli. A 
total of 520 E. coli isolates were confirmed by PCR and 
tested for antimicrobial resistance. The most frequent 
resistance phenotypes among the E. coli isolates in this 

study  included  resistance  to  streptomycin  (47.5%), 
tetracycline  (45.4%),  and  ampicillin  (34.2%).  Fewer 
than 10% of isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol, 
kanamycin,  gentamicin,  ciprofloxacin,  or  ceftriaxone. 
Overall,  65.6%  of  E.  coli  isolates  exhibited  resistance 
to at least one antimicrobial and 37.1% of the isolates 
exhibited multidrug resistance (Table 5).

Several unique multidrug resistance (MDR) profiles 
(n  =  107)  were  exhibited  by  the  E.  coli  isolates—78 
and 68 profiles from large- and small-scale production 
systems, respectively. Thirty-nine profiles were shared 
between  the  2  production  systems  and  are  presented 
in  Supplemental  Table  S1  (https:// doi .org/ 10 .3168/ 
jds .2017 -13665). Overall, the most common resistance 
profiles were cephalothin (n = 39), streptomycin (n = 
37), ampicillin-amoxicillin-clavulanic acid-tetracycline-
streptomycin  (n  =  23),  and  ampicillin-tetracycline-
streptomycin (n = 23). Diverse resistance profiles were

(supplementary  table).  Moreover,  we  found  no  clear 
association between the use of and microbial resistance 
to a given antimicrobial (Table 6).

DISCUSSION

This  study  provides  critical  information  regarding 
the antimicrobials used in Jordanian dairies. The most 
common diseases treated with antimicrobials in these 
dairies  (in  descending  order)  were  mastitis,  metritis, 
and enteritis. Interestingly, some of these diseases; spe-
cifically  enteritis,  can  be  caused  by  pathogens  other 
than bacteria, such as parasites and viruses. Redding et 
al. (2014) reported the use of antiparasitics and antibi-
otics for treating diarrhea cases in small farms in Peru, 
but noted that the antiparasitics might be used to treat 
bacterial and viral diarrhea causes, which would be in-
effective and exacerbate the drug-resistant fascioliasis 
in Peru. Mastitis in Jordanian dairies is treated with 
oxytetracycline,  amoxicillin,  and  sometimes  gentami-
cin,  which  is  a  critically  important  antimicrobial  for 

human  medicine  (WHO,  2012)  and  not  approved  for 
use in dairy cattle in the United States (Smith et al., 
2005). Metritis is mostly treated with ceftiofur, which 
is the same as in the United States (Galvão, 2012). The 
use of this antimicrobial is approved and has no milk 
withdrawal period and a short or no meat withdrawal 
period (Galvão, 2012). Although foot rot is a problem 
in  US  dairy  cattle  (Sawant  et  al.,  2005),  it  was  not 
reported to be a problem in Jordanian dairies, which is 
likely due to the drier climate.

This  study  showed  that  a  limited  number  of  anti-
microbial  classes  are  used  in  Jordanian  dairies;  and 
generally,  oxytetracycline  and  streptomycin  (critically 
important antimicrobials) are the most commonly used. 
These 2 antimicrobials are the most frequently used in 
the  United  States  and  Japan  as  well  (Sawant  et  al., 
2005;  Harada  et  al.,  2006;  Parveen  et  al.,  2006),  and 
oxytetracycline  is  the  most  commonly  used  in  small 
farms in Peru (Redding et al., 2014). Tetracyclines, sul-
fonamides, and β-lactams are the most commonly used 
in  Europe  (NORM/NORM-VET,  2010;  DANMAP, 
2014;  Merle  et  al.,  2014;  SWEDRES/SWEDVARM,

2014).  Other  studies  in  resource-poor  countries  re-
ported a similar limited number of antimicrobial classes 
for treating animals in Costa Rica, Sudan, and Kenya 
(Roderick et al., 2000; Luna-Tortos et al., 2006; Eltayb 
et al., 2012).

Antimicrobial  use  in  lactating  cows  could  lead  to 
residues in milk, which can have adverse public health, 
dairy  product  manufacturing,  and  economic  effects. 
This  risk  can  be  reduced  by  marking,  milking  last, 
and discarding the milk of treated cows following the 
recommended withdrawal period for each antimicrobial 
(Spiegel  et  al.,  2013).  In  our  study,  74.4%  of  herds-
men  marked  their  treated  animals  and  25.6%  milked 
those animals last. Although this finding suggests that 
herdsmen  are  following  correct  practices,  they  might 
do this because their milk cannot be used to make fer-
mented dairy products (antimicrobial residues slow the 
fermentation process by inhibiting the starter culture). 
However,  most  herdsmen  used  a  shorter  withholding 
period  of  3  to  5  d,  which  is  less  than  the  mandated 
withdrawal  period  for  the  widely  used  antimicrobial 
oxytetracycline. Herdsmen from small farms sell their 
milk to small dairy shops, which are numerous and scat-
tered throughout the country. These dairy shop owners 
generally have little knowledge of the adverse effect of 
antimicrobial  residues  on  human  health;  rather,  they 
focus on whether the milk ferments or not. The large 
dairy farms, however, sell their milk to large dairy plants 
that check physical characteristics of the milk, includ-
ing specific gravity, pH, fat percentage, and, sometimes, 
antibiotic  residues  for  antibiotics  that  are  important 
from the point of view of processing. Most herdsmen 
(95.3%) fed milk from treated cows to other calves on 
the farm for 3 to 5 d after treatment. A similarly high 

use of this practice was reported in England and Wales, 
where  65.4%  of  herdsmen  fed  mastitic  milk  to  calves 
(Brunton et al., 2014). The same scenario was reported 
in Sweden, where 56 and 79% of herdsmen fed milk to 
calves during the course of antimicrobial treatment and 
during the milk withdrawal period, respectively (Duse 
et al., 2013). This practice is associated with shedding 
cefotaximase (CTXM)-positive E. coli for a long period 
in  calves  (Brunton  et  al.,  2014),  as  well  as  shedding 
quinolone-resistant E. coli (Duse et al., 2015).

The  frequently  used  antimicrobials  in  dairy  farms 
in  Jordan  are  of  veterinary  importance  (OIE,  2015); 
however, some herdsmen (6%) reported using spectino-
mycin, which is not recommended for dairy cattle older 
than 20 mo because the withdrawal period of this anti-
microbial has not been established (FDA-CVM, 2015).
Jordanian  dairy  herdsmen  reported  changing  an 
antimicrobial  when  an  animal  did  not  respond  to  it 
during the course of treatment. Switching antimicrobi-
als has been described in Peru as well (Redding et al., 
2014),  where  64.6%  of  the  herdsmen  administered  a 
different  antimicrobial  and  16.9%  increased  the  dose 
when an animal did not respond to initial treatment. 
The  practice  of  using  antimicrobials  below  or  above 
the recommended doses was also reported in dairies in 
Switzerland (Gonzalez et al., 2010) and in veal calves 
in Belgium (Pardon et al., 2012).

In our study, a high percentage (64.6%) of the E. coli 
isolates exhibited resistance to at least one antimicro-
bial.  In  contrast,  lower  percentages  (<20%)  were  re-
ported in dairy cattle of resource-rich countries includ-
ing the United States, Germany, and Denmark (Lundin 
et al., 2008; Kaesbohrer et al., 2012; DANMAP, 2014). 
In  the  current  study,  the  MDR  profiles  included  2

common profiles; resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, 
and  streptomycin  (23  isolates  =  21.5%  of  the  MDR 
isolates) and resistance to these 3 antimicrobials plus 
sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim  (12  isolates  =  11.2% 
of  the  MDR  isolates),  amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid  (23 
isolates = 21.5% of the MDR isolates), and amoxicillin-
clavulanic acid and cephalothin (14 isolates = 13.1% of 
the MDR isolates). The ampicillin-tetracycline-strepto-
mycin  resistance  pattern  has  been  reported  by  other 
researchers  in  different  locations  (White  et  al.,  2000; 
Lim  et  al.,  2007;  Alexander  et  al.,  2010;  Kaesbohrer 
et  al.,  2012).  This  pattern  might  be  associated  with 
frequent exposure to minimal levels of tetracycline, of-
ten in combination with chloramphenicol (Blake et al., 
2003), and linked to transferable high-molecular-weight 
plasmids (Karczmarczyk et al., 2011).

Almost  half  of  the  isolates  (45.4%)  exhibited  resis-
tance  to  tetracycline  in  this  study.  Several  studies  in 
multiple  worldwide  locations  reported  frequent  resis-
tance to tetracycline among E. coli isolates (Teshager 
et al., 2000; Sayah et al., 2005; Lim et al., 2007; Lundin 
et al., 2008). The extensive use of tetracycline in human 
and veterinary medicine is attributed to their low cost, 
having few side effects and growth-promotion proper-
ties  (Chopra  and  Roberts,  2001).  Using  tetracycline 
to promote growth is performed in Jordan dairies for 
treating calves and is proven to augment tetracycline 
resistance  (Alexander  et  al.,  2010;  Love  et  al.,  2011; 
Marshall and Levy, 2011; Mirzaagha et al., 2011). The 
use of antimicrobials for growth promotion is banned 
in European countries (Maron et al., 2013). Moreover, 
the reported use of ceftiofur in Jordanian dairies can 
contribute  to  the  high  resistance  to  tetracycline  be-
cause the use of ceftiofur can co-select for and facilitate 
co-amplification of E. coli that exhibit co-resistance to 
tetracycline (Lowrance et al., 2007; Alali et al., 2009).

Considerable  resistance  to  chloramphenicol  was 
found in this study, despite no reported use of this anti-
microbial in dairy farms. Similar findings were reported 
in  Japan  (Lim  et  al.,  2007)  and  Korea  (Harada  and 
Asai, 2010). This might be attributed to co-selection of 
resistant determinants from using other antimicrobials 
(Bischoff et al., 2002; Harada and Asai, 2010) and to 
co-resistance with quinolone and nalidixic acid (Bialek 
et  al.,  2010).  In  addition,  resistance  to  tetracycline 
can be transferred in E. coli due to the genetic linkage 
among their resistance genes (Bischoff et al., 2002).

A  moderate  proportion  (26%)  of  the  isolates  ex-
hibited  resistance  to  cephalothin  (a  first-generation 
cephalosporin)  but  fewer  (3.8%)  exhibited  resistance 
to ceftriaxone (a third-generation cephalosporin). The 
resistance to ceftriaxone, despite no reports of its use 
in  dairy  farms  in  this  study,  might  be  attributed  to 

the wide use of ceftiofur—using ceftiofur can co-select 
for  resistance  to  ceftriaxone  (Tragesser  et  al.,  2006). 
This  led  the  US  Food  and  Drug  Administration  to 
limit  extra-label  use  of  cephalosporin  antimicrobials 
in  cattle,  chickens,  swine,  and  turkeys  (FDA-DHHS, 
2012). Therefore, continuous monitoring for resistance 
to third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins is war-
ranted  in  Jordan  because  these  agents  are  critically 
important  antimicrobials  in  human  medicine  (WHO, 
2012) and their resistance can be disseminated through 
the transfer of mobile genetic elements from animals to 
humans.

Resistance  to  fluoroquinolones  was  relatively  infre-
quent (ciprofloxacin = 3.8%) among the E. coli dairy 
cattle isolates in this study but high enough to cause 
public health concern as this class of antimicrobials is 
of medical importance. Similarly low percentages (less 
than  2%)  of  fluoroquinolone  resistance  were  reported 
in  Korea,  Italy,  Finland,  and  Sweden  (Harada  and 
Asai, 2010) and none were reported in Canada, France, 
Denmark, Germany, and Australia (Harada and Asai, 
2010).  The  reported  resistance  to  fluoroquinolones  in 
the current study might be attributed to the extensive 
use  of  tetracycline  because  resistance  to  fluoroquino-
lones  in  multi-antimicrobial  resistance  isolate  can  be 
co-selected  by  the  use  of  tetracyclines  (Asai  et  al., 
2007).  Moreover,  due  to  their  critical  importance  in 
human  medicine  (WHO,  2012),  the  use  of  fluoroqui-
nolones in veterinary medicine is decreasing in several 
countries and banned in other countries (Cheng et al., 
2012; Garcia-Migura et al., 2014).

This study showed no clear association between the 
use of and resistance to a given antimicrobial. However, 
our sample size was relatively small, we were unable to 
determine recent antimicrobial use, and it was not pos-
sible to have a control farm because there are no farms 
in Jordan with no or minimal antimicrobial use. None-
theless, our findings corroborate previous studies that 
did not find significant associations between antimicro-
bial use and resistance toward a named antimicrobial. 
Rather, antimicrobial use can be a contributing factor 
but probably not the main or single factor causing an-
timicrobial resistance (Bergman et al., 2009; Oliver et 
al., 2011). In our study, the reason why resistance did 
not  correlate  with  use  of  an  antibiotic  could  be  that 
the animals selected had not received treatment in the 
previous  2  wk.  Several  other  studies  have  found  that 
the resistance induced by use is transient (Jiang et al., 
2006; Lowrance et al., 2007; Checkley et al., 2008; Platt 
et  al.,  2008;  Mann  et  al.,  2011;  Morley  et  al.,  2011; 
Boyer and Singer, 2012). Moreover, because herdsmen 
choose antimicrobials based on experience, we assume 
that they would refrain from using antimicrobials with

which  they  previously  experienced  a  perceived  treat-
ment failure. Thus, an association between antimicro-
bial use and resistance might be difficult to detect.

CONCLUSIONS

Our research indicated that antimicrobials are mis-
used  in  Jordanian  dairies;  specifically,  antimicrobial 
agents are administered without a veterinary prescrip-
tion  and  recommended  withdrawal  times  are  not  ad-
hered  to.  Furthermore,  resistance  among  commensal 
E. coli toward antimicrobials of human and veterinary 
importance was high compared with that in other coun-
tries. To address this misuse and emerging resistance, it 
is essential to promote judicious use of antimicrobials in 
livestock operations, through educational programs for 
herdsmen and veterinarians conducted by the Ministry 
of Agriculture, veterinary association committees, and 
academic  institutions.  Immediate  interventions  that 
should be considered in Jordan include the use of cost-
effective  and  simple  antimicrobial  sensitivity  testing 
before  treating  animals.  Banning  the  use  of  critically 
important antibiotics for human health has been suc-
cessfully implemented in several countries and should 
be considered in Jordan.
