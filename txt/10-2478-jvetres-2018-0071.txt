Abstract 

Introduction:  The  study  aimed  to  isolate  thermophilic  Campylobacter  from  chickens  raised  three  rearing  methods, 
determine  its  antimicrobial  susceptibilities,  and  examine  resistance-related  genes  by  PCR.  Material  and  Methods:  Cloacal 
swabs  or  intestinal  contents  were  taken  in  Istanbul,  Sakarya,  and  Izmir  provinces.  Chickens  were  from  small  village-based 
family-run  businesses  (n  =  70),  organically  raised  (n  =  71),  and  conventionally  raised  broilers  (n  =  79).  The  samples  were 
cultured  on  modified  charcoal  cefoperazone  desoxycholate  (mCCD)  agar.  Suspect  isolates  were  identified  with  multiplex  PCR 
(mPCR). As per EUCAST standards, MIC values were derived by broth microdilution for tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic 
acid, kanamycin, gentamicin, and erythromycin in isolates of C. jejuni (n = 98) and C. coli (n = 83). Results: In C. jejuni, 78.6% 
tetracycline, 87.8% ciprofloxacin, and 81.6% nalidixic acid resistance was detected, but none was to kanamycin, gentamicin, or 
erythromycin.  In  C.  coli,  98.8%  ciprofloxacin  and  63.9%  nalidixic  acid  resistance  was  detected,  whereas  resistance  to  non-
quinolones  was  not  observed.  C257T  (Thr-86-Ile)  mutation  in  the  gyrA  gene  of  all  phenotypically  quinolone-resistant  isolates 
was detected through a mismatch amplification mutation assay PCR (MAMA-PCR). It emerged that all isolates bore the tet (O) 
resistance gene. Conclusion: Common tetracycline, nalidixic acid, and ciprofloxacin resistance exists in Campylobacter isolated 
from chickens raised three rearing methods.  
 
Keywords: chicken, antimicrobial resistance, PCR, stools, thermophilic Campylobacter. 

Introduction 

Thermophilic  Campylobacter  species,  including 
Campylobacter  jejuni  and  Campylobacter  coli,  are 
among  the  most  common  bacterial  gastroenteritis 
agents  in  both  developed  and  developing  countries 
(29).  Thermophilic  Campylobacter  species  are  flora 
bacteria  in  chicken  and  poultry  intestines,  these  being 
the  main  reservoir  for  this  pathogen.  Infection  in 
humans  occurs  as  a  result  of  intake  of  water  and  food 
contaminated  with  Campylobacter  by  the  digestive 
system.  Poultry-based 
foods  play  a  particularly 
important  role  in  the  spread  of  the  disease  (29). 
Thermophilic  Campylobacter 
infections  are  also 

closely 
a neurological disorder (10, 25, 29).

Sample  collection.  Between  October  2014  and 
May  2015,  a  total  of  220  cloacal  swabs  or  intestinal 
contents were taken from chickens in Istanbul, Sakarya, 
and  Izmir  provinces.  These  were  chickens  typical  of

a  sufficient  amount  to  represent  the  intestinal  contents 
comprehensively were planted onto the Campylobacter 
selective  supplement  modified  charcoal  cefoperazone 
desoxycholate (mCCD) agar surface. This microaerobic 
medium  was  incubated  for  24–48  h  at  42°C  and  the 
colonies  were  first  evaluated  in  terms  of  colony 
morphology  and  colour.  The  Gram  characteristics  of 
the  colonies  were  determined,  and  suspicious  colonies 
were  purified  by  passage  through  blood  agar.  Catalase 
positive/negative, 
isolates  were 
examined for their motile ability, and those which were 
mobile were considered suspicious (7).

The identification of isolates for Campylobacter spp. 
jejuni  (mapA  gene),  and  
(16S  rRNA;  23),  C. 
C. coli (ceuE gene) was performed by multiplex mPCR 
(Table  2,  26).  To  extract  genomic  DNA,  a  loopful  of 
bacterial  colonies  harvested  from  agar  plates  was 
suspended  in  0.5  mL  of  sterile  water,  heated  at  95°C 
for  10  min,  and  centrifuged  at  5,000  rpm  for  5  min  at 
4°C  (20).  Amplification  of  the  chromosomal  region 
was  performed  with  a  PCR  mixture  which  contained  
5 µL of 10× PCR buffer, 1.5 mmol of MgCl2, 2 µL of 
dNTP  mix 
(2.5  mM  each  of  deoxynucleoside 
triphosphate),  1  µL  of  forward  and  reverse  primers  
(2.5 pmol/µL MD16S1/S2, 10 pmol/µL MDmapA1/A2, 
and  10  pmol/µL  COL3/MDCOL2),  0.2  µL  of  Taq 
polymerase  (5  U/µL,  Takara  Bio  Inc,  Japan),  5  µL  of 
target  DNA,  and  up  to  50  µL  of  distilled  water. 
Amplification  was  performed  in  a  Maxygene  thermal 
cycler (Axygen, USA) with 35 cycles of 95°C for 60 s 
as  initial  denaturation,  95°C  for  15  s  as  denaturation, 
59°C  for  60  s  as  the  annealing  step,  72°C  for  90  s  as 
extension,  and  3  min  as  the  final  extension  step  at 
72°C. The products obtained after PCR were subjected 
to  electrophoresis  at  200  V  in  1%  agarose  gel  for  
30  min  and  were  stained  with  ethidium  bromide  
(0.5  μg/mL)  (26).  C.  jejuni  ATCC  33560  and  C.  coli 
ATCC 33559 were used as positive control strains.

It  was  revealed  by  the  PCR  that  all  isolates  
that  were  phenotypically  resistant  to  ciprofloxacin  
(86 C. jejuni and 82 C. coli) contained point mutations 
in  the  gyrA  gene  of  Thr-86-Ile  of  the  DNA  gyrase 
enzyme.  The  chain  reaction  also  showed  that  all 
isolates  that  were  phenotypically  tetracycline-resistant 
(77 C. jejuni) contained the tet (O) gene involved in the 
synthesis of the ribosomal protective protein.  

Discussion 

This  study  clearly  demonstrates  that  thermophilic 
Campylobacter species are commonly seen in chickens 
raised  by  three  different  methods.  The  antimicrobial 
resistance  rate  differs  according  to  the  chicken  rearing 
method  and  this  difference  stands  out  in  conventional 
broiler  isolates.  Isolates  with  multiple  antimicrobial 
resistance were not detected in this study.  

While  both  Campylobacter  species  (C.  jejuni  and 
C. coli) were isolated from organic broilers and village 
chickens, only C. coli was isolated from conventionally 
reared  broilers  (P  =  0.048).  C.  jejuni  was  the  most 
dominant  microorganism  isolated  from  both  organic 
broilers and village chickens. This finding is similar to 
those of previous studies (5, 33). The isolation of only 
C.  coli  from  the  samples  from  conventionally  reared 
chickens  was  determined  to  be  derogative  finding. 
There  are,  however,  studies  indicating  that  C.  coli  is 
isolated  as  the  dominant  species  in  commercial  ducks 
and  organic  and  free-range  chickens  (24,  29).  It  was 
thought  that  the  possibility  of  isolating  C.  coli  from 

conventionally  reared  broilers  may  depend  on  the 
hygiene of the poultry and shelter, the type of breeding 
of the animals, the season, and the drugs used.  

field  and 

The quinolone group antibiotics were used as feed 
additives  in  previous  years  (30).  El-Adawy  et  al.  (9) 
reported  resistance  to  nalidixic  acid  and  ciprofloxacin 
in  organically  grown  turkeys.  It  has  been  shown  
that  quinolone-resistant  Campylobacter  strains  in  the 
environment  could  be 
identified  on  a  30-metre  
wind-exposed 
that  quinolone-resistant 
Campylobacter  strains  could  also  contain  quinolone-
sensitive  strains  even  in  the  absence  of  antimicrobial 
use.  This  finding  is  consistent  with  other  studies 
showing  that  some  quinolone-resistant  strains  can 
survive  on  farms  for  several  rotations  (24).  The 
detection of nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin resistance 
from  organic  farming  isolates  in  this  study  was  found 
to be statistically significant (P < 0.001). It was thought 
that  the  detection  of  this  resistance  could  be  a  legacy 
effect of the production by the farms where the samples 
were  collected  of  reared  broilers  in  previous  years. 
While the use of quinolone antibiotics in village-raised 
chickens  and  floor-reared  broilers  is  unknown,  high 
resistance 
is 
detected.  Alfredson  and  Korolik  (2)  studied  poultry 
coops  and  reported  that  the  quinolones  used  in  the 
treatment  of  infections  led  to  the  development  of 
ciprofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter by their entering 
the  food  chain  as  a  result  of  selective  effect.  These 
authors  stated  that  a  large  number  of  resistant  clones 
had been selectively transferred as a result of quinolone 
treatment.  It  has  been  shown  in  previous  studies  that

the  use  of  quinolone  antibiotics  as  feed  additive 
increases  the  incidence  of  quinolone  resistance  in 
thermophilic Campylobacter isolates in Turkey (1, 4, 6, 
30,  32).  The  high  quinolone  resistance  in  this  study  is 
compatible  with  the  findings  of  researchers  both  in 
Turkey and in other countries.  

this  study, 

C257T  (Thr-86-Ile)  mutation  has  been  nominated 
as 
in  quinolone 
the  main  resistance  mechanism 
resistance  (34,  35).  While  Aslantaş  (4)  discovered  the 
same  mutation  on  all  his  isolates,  Kurekci  and  Onen 
(21)  reported  Ala40Ser  mutation  in  addition  to  this 
mutation. In this study, the statistical significance of the 
C257T  (Thr-86-Ile)  mutation  in  the  gyrA  gene  was 
found  to  be  significant  for  all  isolates  resistant  to 
ciprofloxacin  (P  <  0.001).  This  finding  is  similar  to 
other studies showing the significance of an increase in 
resistance  (8,  9,  18).  In 
tetracycline 
resistance  was  detected  in  C.  jejuni  strains  isolated 
from  organic  broiler  production  (P  <  0.001),  and  all 
these  isolates  carried  the  tet  (O)  gene,  which  was 
compatible with the results of Hungaro et al. (18). High 
tetracycline  resistance  in  thermophilic  Campylobacter 
strains  isolated  from  the  organic  production  type  has 
also  been  reported  in  another  study  (24).  Since 
antibiotics of the tetracycline  group  have been  used as 
feed  additives  for  both  treatment  and  protection  in 
farms and poultry for a long time (14), resistant strains 
could have been transmitted over the  years and can be 
found  extensively 
in  animal  housing  structures 
regardless of the rearing method. This finding revealed 
that  antibiotic  use  was  not  the  only  reason  for  the 
development of resistant bacteria.  

No  isolates  from  any  of  the  three  different 
production  types  showed  resistance  to  kanamycin, 
gentamicin, or erythromycin in the study. It seems that 
there  is  low  resistance  against  these  antibiotics,  as 
demonstrated  in  other  studies  in  Turkey  (1,  6,  17). 
According

concerning with European countries; it was reported to 
be  0%  in  Lithuania,  Austria,  and  Denmark,  2%  in 
Germany,  7%  in  Portugal,  and  8%  in  Belgium  (13).  It 
was  posited  that  the  low  resistance  to  these  antibiotics 
was due to their rare use in prophylaxis and therapy in 
the poultry industry.

resistance 

In  this  study,  isolates  carrying  multiple  antibiotic 
resistance  were  not  detected.  Elsewhere,  multiple-
antibiotic-resistant isolates have been reported in some 
studies  (1,  4,  31).  The  difference  between  reported  
rates  could  depend  on  the  antibiotic  test  sensitivity  of 
methods  used  by 
the  number  of 
antimicrobial agents, and the method of sampling.  

researchers, 

The 

that 

literature  reveals 

the  antimicrobial 
resistant Campylobacter isolates can be transmitted and 
are  long-lasting.  It  also  brings  to  light  that  antibiotic 
use  is  not  the  only  reason  for  the  development  of 
resistant  bacteria  and  reveals  the  problem  of  removing 
resistant isolates from farms. The rate of antimicrobial-
resistant  thermophilic  Campylobacter  increases  every 
year.  Particularly,  against  the  antibiotics  such  as  the 

 

quinolone  group  which  are  no  longer  used  as  feed 
additives,  the  resistance  is  bordering  on  becoming 
permanent.  Widespread  resistance  to  quinolone  and 
tetracycline, determined even in chickens which had no 
history  of  antibiotic  use,  compels  us  to  apply  these 
antimicrobials  nationally  only  in  a  controlled  and 
conscious manner.
