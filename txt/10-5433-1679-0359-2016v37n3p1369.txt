Abstract

Brazil currently ranks as one of the world leaders in food production and exportation. This scenario 
encourages the development of animal and plant health programs to ensure the production of safe food, 
helping the country to become an international provider of food for excellence. However, some health 
problems in dairy production, such as mastitis, have garnered increasing concern. This study aimed to 
estimate the prevalence of bovine mastitis in select properties located in the western Santa Catarina 
region, to assess the susceptibility profile to antimicrobial agents used for treatment and to check for the 
presence of genes (icaA and icaD) associated with biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus. In 148 
milk samples collected, 72.97% had bacterial growth (n = 108). Among the isolated microorganisms, 
21.62% (n = 32) were classified as Staphylococcus aureus, 18.91% (n = 28) as Staphylococcus sp. 
coagulase negative, 7.43% (n = 11) as Corynebacterium sp., 6.76% (n = 10) as Staphylococcus sp. 
coagulase positive, 5.41% (n = 8) as Nocardia sp. and 12.83% (n = 19) classified in different bacterial 
genera. Among the isolates submitted for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, it was observed that 8.95% 
(n = 6/67) had resistance to amoxicillin, 8.04% (n = 7/87) to ampicillin, 5.88% (n = 5/85) to cephalothin, 
3.40% (n = 3/88) to ceftiofur and enrofloxacin, 20.45% (n = 18/88) to streptomycin, 17.04% (n = 15/88) 
to  gentamicin  and  lincomycin,  31.81%  (n  =  28/88)  to  neomycin,  14.94%  (n  =  13/87)  to  penicillin 
and 25% (n = 22/88) to tetracycline. Staphylococcus sp. coagulase negative isolates showed higher 
multidrug resistance when compared to those of S. aureus and Staphylococcus sp. coagulase positive. 
Thirty-one strains of S. aureus isolates were genotypically tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 
yielding a positive result for the icaA gene in 83.87% of the samples, 80.64% positive for icaD and 
74.19% of these showed both genes. The results reinforce the importance of controlling this disease by 
adopting strict hygiene protocols and disinfection of equipment used for milking and the prescription 
of appropriate therapies to clinical and subclinical cases of mastitis, as well as evaluating not only the 
susceptibility profile of isolates but also the biofilm formation capacity.

O Brasil situa-se hoje como um dos líderes mundiais em produção e exportação de alimentos. Este 
cenário incita a elaboração de programas de sanidade animal e vegetal que garantam a produção de 
alimentos  seguros,  contribuindo  para  que  o  país  se  torne  um  fornecedor  internacional  de  alimentos 
por  excelência.  Entretanto,  alguns  problemas  sanitários  na  produção  leiteira,  como  a  mastite,  têm 
acarretado crescentes preocupações. O presente estudo teve como objetivo estimar a prevalência de 
mastite bovina em algumas propriedades localizadas na região Oeste de Santa Catarina, avaliar o perfil 
de  suscetibilidade  aos  antimicrobianos  empregados  para  tratamento  e  verificar  a  presença  de  genes 
(icaA e icaD) associados à formação de biofilmes em Staphylococcus aureus. Em 148 amostras de leite 
coletadas, 72,97% apresentaram crescimento bacteriano (n=108). Dentre os micro-organismos isolados, 
21,62% (n=32) foram classificados como Staphylococcus aureus, 18,91% (n=28) como Staphylococcus 
sp. coagulase negativa, 7,43% (n=11) como Corynebacterium sp., 6,76% (n=10) como Staphylococcus 
sp. coagulase positiva, 5,41% (n=8) como Nocardia sp. e 12,83% (n=19) classificados em diferentes 
gêneros bacterianos. Dentre os isolados submetidos ao teste de suscetibilidade aos antimicrobianos, 
observou-se 8,95% (n=6/67) de resistência à Amoxicilina, 8,04% (n=7/87) à Ampicilina, 5,88% (n=5/85) 
à  Cefalotina,  3,40%  (n=3/88)  ao  Ceftiofur  e  Enrofloxacina,  20,45%  (n=18/88)  à  Estreptomicina, 
17,04% (n=15/88) à Gentamicina e Lincomicina, 31,81% (n=28/88) à Neomicina, 14,94% (n=13/87) à 
Penicilina e 25% (n=22/88) à Tetraciclina. Ainda, os isolados de Staphylococcus sp. coagulase negativa 
apresentaram maior multirresistência quando comparados aos isolados de S. aureus e Staphylococcus 
sp. coagulase positiva. Trinta e uma amostras de S. aureus isoladas foram testadas genotipicamente 
pela  técnica  de  reação  em  cadeia  da  polimerase  (PCR),  obtendo-se  resultado  positivo  em  83,87% 
das amostras para o gene IcaA, 80,64% positivas para IcaD e 74,19% dessas apresentaram ambos os 
genes. Os resultados obtidos demonstram a importância do controle desta enfermidade pela adoção 
de protocolos rígidos de higiene e desinfecção dos equipamentos utilizados na ordenha e também a 
prescrição de terapias adequadas aos casos clínicos e subclínicos de mastite, bem como a avaliação não 
apenas do perfil de suscetibilidade dos isolados, mas também a capacidade de formação de biofilmes.

Introduction 

Brazil is considered one of the largest producers 
of  milk,  and  the  South  and  Southeast  regions  are 
the main producers. Santa Catarina state is the sixth 
largest  national  milk  producer,  and  approximately 
70% of Santa Catarina’s production is concentrated 
in  the  western  region  (IBGE,  2013),  playing  an 
important role for small farms from an economic and 
social point of view. Milk production is responsible 
for direct and indirect job creation and income to 
farmers, thus becoming one of the most important 
activities related to rural development. 

In  this  context,  the  quality  of  milk  is  essential 
for the competitiveness of dairy farming; quality is 
influential in both the manufacture of dairy products 
and derivatives as well as in consumer preference. 
Despite advances in the dairy cattle industry, one of 
the barriers to the development and consolidation of 
the dairy industry in Brazil is the quality of the milk 
(FAGUNDES; OLIVEIRA, 2004).

Some health problems in the dairy industry have 
caused increasing concerns. Mastitis is characterized 
by an inflammation of the mammary gland, usually 
infectious in nature, in which bacteria are the main 
etiological agents. This condition affects dairy cattle 
and leads to losses resulting from the reduction in 
milk production, animal value depreciation, limiting 
the production of derivative products, milk disposal, 
spending  on  medicines,  veterinary  fees,  labor 
augmentation,  early  disposal  of  females,  among 
others. Furthermore, the possibility of transmission 
of pathogenic microorganisms and/or their toxins or 
transfer of antibiotic residue through the milk pose 
severe risks to public health (FORSYTHE, 2002). 
the  main  agent 
associated  with  the  contagious  bovine  mastitis. 
Many  chronic  infections  caused  by  this  pathogen 
are  related  to  the  formation  of  biofilms;  this 
feature  hinders  the  action  of  macrophages,  and  it 
also provides resistance to various antibiotics and

environment (BOYEN et al., 2009). Several genes 
are  involved  in  the  individual  capacity  of  biofilm 
formation,  highlighting  the  icaA  and  icaD  genes 
(MELCHIOR et al., 2009). 

Antibiotic  use  in  the  treatment  of  mastitis  is 
frequent;  however,  there  has  been  an  increase  in 
the bacterial resistance index (BRITO et al., 2001). 
This  fact  reinforces  the  importance  of  adopting 
appropriate 
treatment  protocols  with  effective 
medicines, which must be selected from phenotypic 
and genotypic testing (COELHO et al., 2007). 

This  study  aimed  to  estimate  the  prevalence 
of  bovine  mastitis  in  dairy  farms  located  in  the 
western  region  of  Santa  Catarina  to  determine 
the main isolated microorganisms, to evaluate the 
susceptibility front of the main antibiotics used in 
the  treatment  of  this  disease,  as  well  as  to  check 
for  the  presence  of  genes  associated  with  biofilm 
formation in S. aureus strains. 

Material and Methods
Place of execution and collection of material

A  total  of  148  individual  milk  samples  were 
collected from 148 animals on 12 farms located in 
the western region of Santa Catarina. All properties 
analyzed had adopted the mechanics milking system, 
and  the  herds  were  composed  of  primiparous  and 
pluriparous  cows  of  different  races  and  different 
stages of lactation.

samples, 

All  procedures  performed  in  the  collection, 
transportation 
and 
identification  of  the  etiologic  agents  of  mastitis 
followed the recommendations of National Mastitis 
Council (2004). Prior to harvest, the ceilings were 
individually  cleaned  using  water  and  disposable 
paper  towels,  disregarding  the  three  foremilk  on 
black background mug to evaluate for the presence 
of clinical mastitis. The CMT (California Mastitis 
Test)  was  performed  to  confirm  the  presence  of 
subclinical  mastitis  without  the  evaluation  of 

different  degrees.  Prior  to  taking  the  samples,  the 
animal teats were disinfected with cotton that was 
soaked with 70% ethanol. Three milk jets from each 
teat were collected and stored in sterile vials, and 
CMT testing was performed on sample from each 
animal. The vials were opened only at the moment 
of harvest; they were opened in a horizontal position 
to  avoid  contaminants  entering  into  the  container. 
The  samples  were  duly  identified  and  kept  under 
refrigeration  (4  to  8  °  C)  during  transport  to  the 
microbiology laboratory for further analysis. 

Isolation and bacterial identification

The  cultivation  of  the  samples  was  performed 
on blood agar supplemented with 5% defibrinated 
sheep blood, MacConkey agar and Sabouraud agar. 
The plates were incubated at 36°C for 24 to 48 hours, 
the microorganisms were identified according to the 
morphological and staining characteristics according 
to the description presented by Markey et al. (2013). 
After  incubation,  the  colonies  were  evaluated 
according to the morphological characteristics and 
hemolysis  patterns.  Gram-staining  and  catalase 
tests were performed, the latter separating the likely 
Staphylococcus and Micrococcus strains (catalase-
positive)  from  Streptococcus  and  Enterococcus 
strains (catalase-negative); this also assisted in the 
identification  of  strains  of  Corynebacterium  sp. 
The isolates that were positive for the catalase test 
were submitted to the coagulase test tube, acetoin 
production  and  growth  on  agar  salt  mannitol. 
The  isolates  that  were  negative  in  the  catalase 
test  underwent  the  esculin  test,  bile  esculin  test, 
Pyrrolidonyl  arylamidase  test,  hippurate,  CAMP 
and  NaCl  6.5%  to  characterize  the  species.  For 
isolates that presented as Gram-negative, the tests 
used  were  oxidase,  OF,  motility,  indole, VM, VP, 
citrate, urea, gelatin, TSI, among others. 

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Once the strains had been isolated and identified, 
susceptibility testing to antibiotics was performed by

in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  of  the 
veterinary CLSI (2008) to evaluate the susceptibility 
profile  of  the  front  of  these  microorganisms 
compared  to  antimicrobials  commonly  used  in 
treatment of mastitis. The following antimicrobials 
classes  were  tested:  beta-lactams  –  penicillin  (10 
IU), amoxicillin (10μg), ampicillin (10μg), oxacillin 
(1μg),  cephalothin  (30μg)  and  ceftiofur  (30μg); 
aminoglycosides – streptomycin (10μg), gentamicin 
(10μg)  and  neomycin  (10μg);  lincosamides  – 
lincomycin (2μg); fluoroquinolones – enrofloxacin 
(5μg);  sulfonamides  –  sulfazotrim  (25μg)  and 
tetracycline – tetracycline (30μg). All isolates were 
stored on nutrient agar and then stored at –20 ° C in 
BHI broth and glycerol in a 8:2 ratio, respectively. 

Presence of genes associated with biofilm formation 
Isolates  of  Staphylococcus  aureus  were 
characterized  by  the  presence  of  genes  associated 
with the formation of biofilms (icaA and icaD) by 
PCR. The DNA extraction was performed according 
to  the  description  of  Rademaker  and  De  Bruijn 
(1997). 

For  PCR  execution,  4  µl  of  DNA  suspension 
were applied in 11μl of mix containing 20 pmol/μl 
of each primer, 2.5 mM of the deoxyribonucleotides, 
1.5μL 10 × PCR buffer (750 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.8) 
200 mM (NH4)2SO4 and 0.1% Tween 20) and 0.3 µL 
Taq DNA Polymerase 5 U / uL. This mixture was 
brought to the thermocycler with cyclical conditions 
suggested by Vasudevan et al. (2003). Modifications 
were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 ° C for 2 
min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 ° C for 45 s, 
annealing at 49.8 ° C for 45 s, 1 min extension at 
72  °  C  and  a  final  extension  of  7  min  at  72  °  C. 
In all reactions, negative control samples were used 
(without target DNA), and the positive control was 
S. aureus strain ATCC 25923. The banding patterns 
were  evaluated  using  a  100  bp  molecular  weight 
marker. 

The results of the PCRs were checked on 1.5% 
agarose  gel,  stained  with  ethidium  bromide  (2 
µg/  ml,  Sigma,  St.  Louis,  USA),  visualized  on  a 
transilluminator,  and  the  image  was  captured  and 
digitized  by  the  Kodak  2200  system  (Rochester, 
New York, USA). The primers for detecting icaD 
and icaA genes in S. aureus isolates are described 
in Table 1.

All isolates of Staphylococcus aureus presented 
sensitivity to ampicillin, cephalothin and ceftiofur; 
higher  levels  of  resistance  were  observed  in  the 
principles neomycin (37.5%, n = 12/32), gentamicin 
(28.12%,  n  =  9/32)  and  tetracycline  (12.5%,  n 
=  4/32),  which  are  principles  used  frequently  in 
systemic and topical treatments. 

Although S. aureus isolates are among the most 
prevalent and pathogenic in this study, CNS isolates 
showed  greater  resistance  to  the  total  number  of 
classes of antimicrobials evaluated when compared 
to S. aureus and SCP (Table 3). 

Multidrug-resistant  isolates  in  this  study  were 
defined  as  those  isolates  that  were  resistant  to 

three  or  more  antimicrobial  classes,  according  to 
Schwarz et al. (2010). One Enterococcus sp. isolate, 
nine CNS and three S. aureus presented multidrug 
resistance  profiles  to  antibiotics,  and  some  strains 
expressed  resistance  to  five  evaluated  classes. 
Multidrug resistance profiles are detailed in Table 3. 
Of  the  31  S.  aureus  isolates  evaluated  for  the 
presence  of  icaA  and  icaD  genes  associated  with 
formation  of  biofilm,  83.87%  had  the  icaA  gene, 
80.64%  icaD  the  gene  and  74.19%  were  positive 
for both genes. The DNA extraction of one isolate 
could not be performed; thus, it was not submitted 
for PCR analysis.

Discussion

Of  all  the  obtained  samples,  108  showed 
bacterial  growth  (72.97%),  which  reveals  a  high 
prevalence  of  mastitis  in  the  sampled  herds.  As 
reported  in  Zanela  et  al.  (2006),  the  high  mastitis 
levels are directly linked to hygienic conditions of 
the property and animal health, including flaws in 
the cleaning of pickets, management problems and 
milking environment, as well as failures in nutrition 
of animals. 

Of  the  148  isolates,  40  (27.03%)  showed  no 
microbial  growth.  Although  bacterial  isolation 
is  considered  the  gold  standard  technique  for 
characterizing 
the  etiology  of  mastitis,  some 
samples  of  milk  with  clinical  and  subclinical 
mastitis can present negative results (MAKOVEC; 
RUEGG,  2003).  This  fact  can  be  justified  due  to 
the intermittent elimination of the agent in chronic 
infections  or  from  their  reduced  presence  in  milk 
(SEARS et al., 1990). 

S. aureus was the most prevalent agent (21.62%) 
in  this  study.  Similar  data  were  described  by 
Ferreira et al. (2007) and Martins (2010) in which 

both observed a 21.5% of prevalence of S. aureus 
strains isolated in cases of subclinical mastitis. In 
both studies, the evaluated properties had adopted 
similar  managements  as  the  use  of  mechanical 
milking at different stages of lactation. They were 
unable to evaluate whether there was any pattern in 
temporal distribution, such as seasonality between 
the  isolated  microorganisms,  as  the  samples  were 
taken at different times of the year. 

S. aureus is considered to be the most important 
microorganism  in  contagious  mastitis  in  cattle. 
Despite  nearly  a  22%  prevalence,  this  percentage 
may  be  determined  to  be  low  when  compared  to 
the  ratios  reported  in  other  studies.  Unakal  and 
Kaliwal (2010) evaluated 105 samples of milk from 
different dairy farms and reported a prevalence of 
approximately 65% for this agent; other authors also 
reported a high prevalence (WAAGE et al., 1999). 
The  second  most  prevalent  agent  was  the 
CNS,  which  highlights  the  importance  of  this 
microorganism  as  the  etiologic  agent  of  mastitis 
in  this  study. Amaral  et  al.  (2003)  emphasize  the 
importance of infection in the mammary gland as a

term  processes  that  compromise  the  composition 
and milk production. In similar studies, the authors 
found CNS as the most prevalent agent (FREITAS 
et  al., 2005; TENHAGEN  et  al., 2006). A  similar 
result  was  found  by  Marques  et  al.  (2013),  who 
analyzed 272 samples of milk from eight properties 
of the South Fluminense region of the state of Rio 
de Janeiro and found 250 isolates of Staphylococcus 
spp.,  from  which  58%  (145/250)  were  CNS  and 
42%  (105/250)  Staphylococcus  sp.  coagulase 
positive. Of these, 36.2% (38/105) were identified 
as S. aureus. 

In relation to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, 
high bacterial resistance rates were observed when 
evaluating  antibiotics  neomycin, 
tetracycline, 
streptomycin, gentamicin, lincomycin and penicillin. 
Although some studies show higher resistance rates 
(RABELLO et al., 2005; ZAFALON et al., 2008; 
UNAKAL; KALIWAL, 2010), this may be related 
to the more frequent use of these agents and/or the 
presence of genes associated with biofilm formation 
(MELCHIOR et al., 2006a). 

Oliveira  (2002)  showed  a  high  percentage  of 
resistance  of  Staphylococcus  sp.  samples  isolated 
from animals with subclinical mastitis; the resistance 
was especially present in penicillin and tetracycline. 
These authors noted the incorrect and indiscriminate 
use of these antimicrobials was responsible for this 
situation. However, in the present study, there was a 
higher percentage of in vitro resistance to neomycin, 
gentamicin and streptomycin. These antibiotics are 
widely used in dairy cattle to treat various conditions 
(NETTO et al., 2005), especially uterine infections, 
often  in  under-dosing  due  to  the  application  in 
the  form  of  infusion.  In  addition,  several  drugs 
of  intramammary  application  have  these  three 
antimicrobials  in  their  compositions,  which  may 
have contributed to the increase in resistance rates, 
especially when therapy is administered incorrectly. 
Although  S.  aureus  was  the  most  frequently 
isolated  agent,  a  result  of  extreme  importance  in 

this study was that CNS multidrug-resistant isolates 
compared to S. aureus and SCP. Rajala-Schultz et al. 
(2004), in a study evaluating 202 bacterial agents, 
showed a prevalence of 78% of CNS, and of these, 
44%  were  resistant  to  more  than  one  antibiotic. 
Similarly,  Medeiros  et  al.  (2009)  also  found  CNS 
isolated  from  cows  with  subclinical  mastitis  with 
resistance  profiles  for  more  than  eight  different 
antimicrobial  compounds.  This  finding  reinforces 
the  importance  of  this  agent  in  cases  of  mastitis 
because the multidrug resistance to treatment may 
be associated with persistence of agents in the herd, 
leading  to  cases  of  chronic  infection  as  well  as 
predisposing to further infection. 

Human  diseases  caused  by  S.  aureus  multi-
resistant strains from animals are found worldwide, 
which makes it essential to assess the susceptibility of 
this isolated microorganism in relation to antibiotics. 
The  increasing  number  of  globally  distributed 
multi-drug resistant isolates from mastitis cases is 
a serious problem that causes increases in treatment 
costs and a greater likelihood of transmission of this 
disease due to the persistence of bacteria in the herds 
(SABOUR et al., 2004; FAGUNDES; OLIVEIRA, 
2004).  The  importance  of  carrying  out  accurate 
diagnosis 
identification 
of  agents  in  laboratories  and  in  vitro  analysis  of 
antimicrobial  susceptibility  is  emphasized,  mainly 
to  prescribe  the  most  appropriate  therapy  and  so 
reduce the risk of bacterial multidrug resistance. 

isolation  and 

through 

Most S. aureus isolates evaluated demonstrated 
the presence of one or both genes associated with 
biofilm formation. The ability of the bacterial agents 
to  form  a  biofilm  is  directly  related  to  microbial 
adhesion to a variety of surfaces, allowing it to be 
found  on  the  milking  environment,  including  the 
udder  and  teats  of  the  animals,  blowers,  milking 
machines and utensils used in the cleaning before 
and after milking. These factors make it difficult to 
control mastitis in dairy farms (LEE et al., 2012). 
In  the  biofilm,  bacteria  remain  less  susceptible  to 
the  action  of  antibiotics  and  innate  host  response 
by  preventing  phagocytosis,  as  well  as  favoring

in  the  environment.  Melo  (2012)  investigated  the 
presence  of  icaA  and  icaD  (genes  responsible  for 
the synthesis of the biofilm) in 94 S. aureus strains 
isolated from milk samples derived from cattle with 
subclinical mastitis and confirmed that 95.7% had 
both genes. Vasudevan et al. (2003) also analyzed 
S. aureus strains isolated from bovine milk samples 
with  subclinical  mastitis  and  found  100%  were 
positive  for  icaA  and  icaD,  thus  confirming  the 
potential  of  these  genes  as  virulence  factor  in  the 
pathogenesis  of  mastitis  of  ruminants.  The  high 
presence  of  icaA  and  icaD  genes  in  S.  aureus 
isolates  emphasizes  the  importance  in  controlling 
mastitis caused by this agent because once formed 
the biofilm, the infection is likely to become chronic 
and difficult to treat. 

Despite  the  high  presence  of  icaA  and  icaD 
genes,  only  three  S.  aureus  isolates  showed  a 
multidrug resistance profile with the disk diffusion 
test. Detection of the icaA and icaD genes in most 
tested isolates demonstrates that these strains may 
come to form biofilm once activation occurs. Thus, 
even  when  the  isolates  presented  sensitivity  to 
various antibiotics, this microorganism can remain 
protected  from  the  action  of  these  by  biofilms. 
The  discrepancy  between  the  results  of  in  vitro 
antimicrobial  susceptibility  and  the  in  vivo  cure 
obtained  by  antimicrobial  therapies  highlights  the 
importance of biofilm formation in vivo by S. aureus, 
which in turn has resulted in disappointing cure rates, 
especially  in  long  term  infections  (MELCHIOR 
et  al.,  2006b).  Melchior  et  al.  (2011)  evaluated  a 
collection of S. aureus isolates from bovine mastitis 
cases  by  antimicrobial  susceptibility  extended  to 
biofilm test (EBS) and found the duration of therapy 
as the most important factor for the bovine mastitis 
cure  rate.  However,  this  same  article  emphasized 
that  treatment  should  be  recommended  only  in 
recent S. aureus infections. 

Conclusion

Despite  the  role  that  the  high  prevalence  of 
bovine mastitis directly plays in the sustainability 
and  viability  of  dairy  cattle,  the  occurrence  of 
multidrug resistance coupled with gene expression 
capacity  that  is  associated  with  the  formation  of 
biofilms  reinforces  the  importance  of  controlling 
this disease by adopting strict protocols of hygiene 
and  disinfection  of  equipment  used  in  milking. 
Furthermore,  it  also  aids  in  prescribing  therapies 
appropriate to the clinical and subclinical mastitis, 
especially in S. aureus infections. 

Although  high  levels  of  susceptibility  have 
been found in S. aureus, the observed resistance to 
neomycin, gentamicin, and tetracycline antibiotics 
is  of  concern  because  they  are  frequently  used  in 
treatment  protocols  for  mastitis.  Furthermore,  the 
presence  of  icaD  and  icaA  genes  in  most  isolates 
emphasizes  the  importance  to  assess  both  the 
susceptibility profile of the isolates and the biofilm 
formation capacity. 

The presence of nine CNS strains with multidrug 
resistance profiles is extremely important not only 
for  the  control  of  bovine  mastitis  but  also  with 
regards  to  public  health  because  milk  is  a  major 
source of income for many producers; it is also an 
indispensable food for much of the population.
