Salmonellosis is an infectious zoonotic disease of socio-economic importance worldwide. Food animals
with subclinical infection as well as farm efÔ¨Çuents are usually the sources of contaminated meat, eggs
and milk, which cause diarrhoea and systemic infections in humans. The indiscriminate use of antibiotics
to curb salmonellosis in both animals and humans has contributed to the emergence and spread of drug-
resistant bacteria among both pathogenic and commensal organisms. The aim of the study was therefore
to determine the presence, serovar distribution and antimicrobial resistance proÔ¨Åles of Salmonella iso-
lated from domestic livestock species in South Africa. For this purpose,1069 rectal and cloacal swabs were
collected from pigs (n ¬º 322), chickens (n ¬º 286) and goats (n ¬º 461) from smallholder farms in Lim-
popo, Eastern Cape, Northern Cape, North West and KwaZulu Natal provinces of South Africa. The fre-
quency of occurrence of Salmonella per animal species was highest in pigs (5.90%; n ¬º 19), followed by
chickens (3.15%; n ¬º 9) and goats had the lowest proportion of 0.43% (n ¬º 2). Nine Salmonella serovars
were obtained including S. Techimani, a serovar that was not previously observed in South African an-
imals. Six isolates were assigned to Salmonella II. Some of the Salmonella were untypable (n ¬º 6). All
Salmonella isolates were sensitive to cefotaxime, enroÔ¨Çoxacin, Ô¨Çorphenicol and polymyxin B. Most of the
Salmonella isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial (n ¬º 20; 66.7%) and resistance was pre-
dominant towards trimethoprim (n ¬º 11; 36.7%), followed by ampicillin (n ¬º 5; 16.7%), oxytetracycline
(n ¬º 3; 10%), and kanamycin (n ¬º 1; 3.3%). The results illustrate the presence of diverse and rare Sal-
monella serovars that were not previously isolated from animals in South Africa. The pattern of devel-
opment of antibiotic resistance should be monitored and followed-up. The occurrence of elevated
trimethoprim resistant Salmonella in South African food animals could lead to the emergence and dis-
tribution of drug resistant salmonellosis in human beings.

1. Introduction

In South Africa, poultry is produced by large commercial
farmers, small scale farmers as well as households for eggs and/or
meat. Poultry is one of the cheapest sources of meat. A census that
was undertaken in 2014 indicated that there were approximately

140 million chickens at any one point in South Africa (South Africa
Poultry Association (SAPA, 2014). The majority of chickens were in
North West province (21.7%), followed by Western Cape province
(20.5%), Mpumalanga (17.0%), KwaZulu Natal (13.6%) and Gauteng
province (10.6%) (SAPA, 2014). Goats are found throughout the
country and are a source of meat and milk. In 2004, the South Af-
rican goat population was estimated to be 6.58 million (National
Agricultural Marketing Council, 2005). In 2010, the majority of
goats were found in the Eastern Cape province (37%) and Limpopo
provinces (20%), followed by KwaZulu Natal (13%), North West
(11%), Northern Cape (8%), Western Cape and Free State (4%),

Mpumalanga (2%), and Gauteng province (1%) (Department of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, 2011a). Between 2010 and
2011, the pig population in South Africa was estimated to be 1,584
million (DAFF, 2012), with Limpopo and North West provinces
being the largest producers and production has been increasing
from 2000 to 2009 (DAFF, 2011b).

Households and smallholder farms in the rural communities
keep livestock species under extensive low input farming systems
characterised by poor housing, low quality scavenging feed sources
and limited veterinary interventions. Livestock species are kept as
mixed Ô¨Çocks with minimum biosecurity. The low input production
system and limited biosecurity measures expose the different
livestock species to various pathogens. These livestock are raised
predominantly for food security reasons and they provide house-
holds with cheap and readily available source of meat, eggs and
milk. This is important from a socio-economic standpoint, but
livestock particularly those raised under low input biosecurity
systems, may pose a health risk to humans. It is therefore important
for the veterinary profession to offer solutions to these systems.

Salmonella serovars are some of the most important causes of
food-borne diseases worldwide. Salmonellosis is more likely to be
related to animal food products where they act as vehicles for
transmission (M√ºrmann, dos Santos, & Cardoso, 2009). Alcaine
et al. (2006) indicated that the Salmonella serotypes isolated from
farms are linked to the Salmonella spp causing diseases in humans.
A study in Spain revealed that 40.9% of pig herds were infected with
Salmonella spp (Arguello, S√∏rensen, Carvajal, Baggesen, & Rubio,
2013).
In South Africa, 19% Salmonella spp prevalence was
observed in poultry (Van Nierop et al., 2005).

Salmonella infections are related to management issues and
their control depends on controlling the source of contamination
and transmission. The poultry and pig industries are faced with
Ô¨Ånancial constraints due to these pathogens, and farmers have
resorted to the use of antimicrobial agents for treatment, control
and prevention. In addition, farmers use antimicrobial agents for
production purposes as growth enhancers. These growth pro-
moters are fed to the livestock or poultry to improve their intestinal
composition (Hur, Jawale, & Lee, 2011). This action may result in
antimicrobial resistance, which is a signiÔ¨Åcant public health threat.
The aim of this study was to determine the presence and dis-
tribution, serotypes and antimicrobial resistance proÔ¨Åles of Sal-
monella in domestic livestock species of South Africa. The study
targeted chicken, goats and pigs that are kept by smallholder and
rural households under
low input mixed-livestock farming
systems.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sample collection

The samples were collected from smallholder farms in Limpopo,
Kwa-Zulu Natal, North West, Eastern Cape and Northern Cape
provinces of South Africa. The samples were collected from April
2013 to September 2014 and they were analysed within 48 h. One
thousand and sixty nine samples (cloacal/rectal swabs) were
collected from free-range apparently healthy pigs (n ¬º 322), goats
(n ¬º 461) and chickens (n ¬º 286). The samples were placed in
Amies transport media and transported to the Bacteriology section
of Agricultural Research Council-Onderstepoort Veterinary
Institute.

2.2. Microbiological analysis

2.2.1. Bacterial isolation

Each sample was analysed according to ISO 6579, 2002. S.

Typhimurium ATCC 14028 and Escherichia coli 25922 were included
as positive and negative controls respectively.

2.2.2. Biochemical tests

All presumptive Salmonella isolates were subjected to a battery
of biochemical tests according to ISO 6579, 2002. Isolates showing a
combination of typical Salmonella biochemical reactions were
cultured on BTA and incubated at 37¬±1 C for 24 h, followed by
serotyping.

2.2.3. Serotyping

Salmonella spp serotyping was done using slide agglutination as
prescribed in the White-Kauffmann-Le Minor scheme (Grimont &
Weill, 2007; Popoff & Le Minor, 1997). Salmonella spp serotyping
was undertaken to identify surface antigens (Lipopolysaccharides,
O-antigens) and Ô¨Çagella antigens (H-antigens). Each isolate was
tested for autoagglutination prior to serotyping. Salmonella sus-
pensions that agglutinated on their own without addition of anti-
sera were considered autoagglunating or ‚Äòrough cultures‚Äô and these
were not further serotyped.

For O-typing, loopfuls of saline were separately placed on clean
glass slides, followed by mixing with Salmonella spp (grown on
nutrient agar) until a smooth opaque suspension was formed.
Drops of polyvalent O antisera were added to the bacterial sus-
pensions (antigen), followed by mixing for approximately 2 min.
Bacterial suspensions that remained homogenous were considered
negative, and clumping indicated positive reactions. Salmonella
isolates that reacted with polyvalent O antisera were further typed
with individual monovalent antisera and all reactions were noted.
For H-typing, the Salmonella spp colonies were subcultured
from nutrient agar and each isolate was separately inoculated on
one spot at the centre of Swarm agar, followed by overnight incu-
bation at 37¬±1 C. The bacterial cultures from the edge of the
Swarm agar were suspended in saline and mixed with H-antisera
pools as described for O-typing. The interpretation of negative and
positive (1 Phase) results was similar to that of O-typing. For H-
positive isolates, phase inversion was done prior to detection of
2 H-antigen Phase.

The results of both O and H-typing were combined in order to
determine the Salmonella serovar using the White-Kauffmann-Le
Minor scheme (Grimont & Weill, 2007; Popoff & Le Minor, 1997).

2.2.4. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

All 30 Salmonella spp isolates (Fig. 1) were subjected to anti-
microbial susceptibility tests. The colonies were inoculated in
nutrient broth and turbidity of the suspension was adjusted to 0.5
McFarland standard. A sterile swab was immersed in the nutrient
culture broth and aseptically streaked on Mueller Hinton agar in
three different directions to obtain conÔ¨Çuent growth. Antibiotic
disks (ampicillin (10 mg), cefotaxime (30 mg), enroÔ¨Çoxacin (5 mg),
Ô¨Çorphenicol (30 mg), kanamycin (30 mg), oxytetracycline (30 mg),
polymyxin B (300 mg) and trimethoprim (5 mg)] were dispensed
onto the Mueller Hinton agar and incubated at 37 C for 24 h. The
plates were examined for zones of
inhibition, which were
measured in mm and classiÔ¨Åed as resistant (R), sensitive (S) or
intermediate (I) according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI, 2014) or the manufacturer.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Presence and distribution of Salmonella

The presence and distribution of Salmonella in goats, pigs and
chickens is summarized in Fig. 2. Overall, thirty (2.81%) of 1069
isolates across species were positive for Salmonella. Of these

positive isolates, the frequency of occurrence of Salmonella spp
according to animal species was highest in pigs (5.90%; n ¬º 19),
followed by chickens (3.15%; n ¬º 9) and goats had the lowest
presence of 0.43% (n ¬º 2).

Despite the low proportion of Salmonella from healthy goats in
this study, these bacteria have potential of causing environmental
contamination, which poses a risk to human beings (Edrington
et al., 2009). On the contrary, the prevalence of Salmonella in
goats was higher in other studies. For instance, in a study that was
aimed at determining the prevalence of Salmonella in the faeces of
cows and goats in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa,
Igbinosa (2015) isolated Salmonella from 45% (n ¬º 68) and 55%
(n ¬º 82) of goat and cattle faeces respectively.

The Ô¨Åndings of our study highlights the need for designing and
implementing on-the-farm solutions that could be applied by
smallholder farmers to circumvent the proliferation of Salmonella

spp and antibiotic resistance among food production animals. The
control of Salmonella spp at the farm level is usually complicated,
hence a strategy that involves diverse approaches is recommended
(Forshell & Wierup, 2006). One of strategies would be to establish
the point of infection at the farm level through longitudinal studies
from the stage of weaning to animal slaughter (Ball, Magowan,
Taylor, Bagdonaite, & Madden, 2011). In addition, administration
of comprehensive questionnaires to small holder farmers will assist
with identiÔ¨Åcation of Salmonella prevalence drivers on the farm.
Questionnaire administration will aid the development of statisti-
cal models that can be used to identify factors that inÔ¨Çuence Sal-
monella prevalence (Ball et al., 2011).

3.2. Serotypes

Of the 30 Salmonella isolates, 9 serovars were identiÔ¨Åed
(Table 1). A rare serovar, S. Techimani was identiÔ¨Åed in 9 pigs from
Limpopo and Eastern Cape provinces and this serovar was not
previously identiÔ¨Åed in South African pigs. Six of the Salmonella
isolates were untypeable and could not be further analysed to
serovar level. The 24 typeable serovars were assigned to S. Chester
(n ¬º 1), S. Cardoner (n ¬º 1), S. Sambrae (n ¬º 1), S. Typhimurium
(n ¬º 1), S. Schwarzengrund (n ¬º 2), S. Aarhus (n ¬º 1), S. Pomona
(n ¬º 1), S. Senftenberg (n ¬º 1) and S. Techimani (n ¬º 9) respectively.
The six remaining isolates were classiÔ¨Åed as Salmonella II (n ¬º 6).
Table 1 summarises the diversity of Salmonella serovars among
pigs, goats and chickens in this study. S. Techimani was predomi-
nant in pigs, whereas Salmonella II occurred more frequently in
chicken. Five out of the 6 untypeable Salmonella were isolated from
pigs.

The results illustrate the presence of diverse Salmonella serovars
among pigs, chickens and goats raised by smallholder farmers in
South Africa. These Salmonella serovars could pose a risk to
smallholder farmers through animal handling or environmental
contamination, which usually complicates pathogen control. The
predominance of S. Techimani among the 30 isolates from this
study was unexpected, particularly because this serovar was not
identiÔ¨Åed in a retrospective study conducted over a 11 year period
in South Africa, even among the isolates from pigs (Kidanemariam,
Engelbrecht, & Picard, 2010). S. Techimani was isolated from cattle
in a study that was conducted in Ghana in 1961 (Guinee,

Kampelmacher, & Willems, 1961). Even so, as there is little infor-
mation available with regards to this serotype; thus it would be
paramount to extend the surveillance to more regions in South
Africa in order to establish not only the epidemiology of S. Techi-
mani, but also its human health impact (animal to human interface
under speciÔ¨Åc epidemiological conditions).

Two goats were positive for S. Typhimurium and S. Chester. S.
Typhimurium has a greater potential of causing human salmonel-
losis relative to other serotypes (Sarwari et al., 2001). This is
particularly important in smallholder farms as the animals are in
close contact with humans. A study in Australia tested for the
presence of Salmonella in goats, and relatively lower prevalence of
S. Typhimurium (13%) and S. Chester (11%) were observed as
compared to S. Saintpaul, which had a prevalence of 31% (Duffy,
Barlow, Fegan, & Vanderlinde, 2009).

Some of

the serotypes detected in this study include S.
Schwarzengrund, S. Pomona, S. Sambre, S. Aarhus, S. Cardoner and
S. Senftenberg. S. Schwazerngrund was isolated from chicken (3.3%)
and a pig (3.3%). In USA, S. Schwazerngrund has been linked to
outbreaks of human infections through handling of pet food
(Behravesh et al., 2010).

In this study, S. Senftenberg was isolated from a pig. S. Senf-
tenberg is a common serovar worldwide including South Africa
(Kidanemariam et al., 2010). Salmonella Sambre was isolated in
chicken. There is limited literature about S. Aarhus, S. Sambre and S.
Cardoner. The occurrence of these serovars in food animals owned
by smallholder farmers suggests that free-range animals in South
Africa may be a source of unique serotypes. The occurrence of un-
expected Salmonella in this study could indicate that food animals
raised by smallholder farmers could be an important source of
novel isolates. These could be important pathogens, hence they
must be further characterised.

Isolation of diverse Salmonella serovars among food animals
highlights the need for multisectorial interaction to prevent the
spread of these bacteria from animals and animal products to
humans. Implementation of this ‚Äòone health‚Äô approach requires
forging partnerships among stakeholders in animal and human
health, environment and ecosystems personnel and policy makers
(Centers for Disease Control, 2010; European Union External
Action,
2009;
Vandermissen and Welburn, 2014). Developing national partner-
ships similar to The Human and Animal Infections and Risk Sur-
veillance (HAIRS) group in the United Kingdom would be beneÔ¨Åcial
(Vandermissen and Welburn, 2014). Such an approach will provide
a robust national system for preventing proliferation of zoonotic
and emerging diseases through optimized surveillance.

The variations in Salmonella spp proportions and serovars
among different geographical areas highlights the need for sur-
veillance programmes that will generate information necessary to
implement relevant control measures in order to protect con-
sumers from possible risk of infection from contaminated food

(OfÔ¨Åce International des Epizooties (OIE) Terrestrial Animal Health
Code, 2015). A comprehensive programme covering the entire food
value chain continuum from ‚Äòfarm to fork‚Äô is important for Salmo-
nella control. The initial but imperative step in the control or
reduction strategy of Salmonella infection due to contaminated
eggs and poultry meat should be at the farm level (OIE Terrestrial
Animal Health Code, 2015, chap. 6.5). This would entail testing of
feed and healthy chicken that may be potential asymptomatic
carriers. The national programme for Salmonella surveillance and
control among animals could also be adopted from the OIE
Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2015) and European Union docu-
ments such as ‚ÄòGuidelines for the drafting of EU co-Ô¨Ånanced pro-
grammes for monitoring and eradication of zoonotic Salmonella in
certain poultry populations‚Äô document. Initially, serovars such as S.
Enteritidis, and S. Typhimurium could be targeted. The number of
sampling visits for the different animal species will be determined
using estimated national Salmonella prevalences and risk analysis
data. The national programme would recommend serotyping of all
Salmonella isolates, and assess these bacteria for antimicrobial
resistance. In addition, a vaccination programme (based on preva-
lence rates) should be developed as part of the Salmonella national
surveillance programme. The Salmonella control programme would
include culling of positive animals that incorporates the cost im-
plications prior to culling of animals. Laboratory diagnosis of Sal-
monella should be strengthened.
In addition, participation in
proÔ¨Åciency testing schemes should be compulsory for all labora-
tories involved in Salmonella diagnosis. Furthermore, Good Agri-
cultural Practice and Hazard Analyis Critical Control Points (HAACP)
approaches to food safety are crucial for prevention and control of
Salmonella spp in poultry.
In this study, Salmonella enterica subspecies salamae, also
known as Salmonella II, was isolated in chickens (n ¬º 5) and a pig
from Limpopo province. Salmonella II is commonly found in cold
blooded animals (Brenner, Villar, Angulo, Tauxe, & Swaminathan,
2000). A study conducted in Australia found that the most
frequently isolated Salmonella in commercially produced broiler
chickens was Salmonella II (Duffy, Dykes, & Fegan, 2012).

3.3. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

All Salmonella isolates were sensitive to cefotaxime, enro-
Ô¨Çoxacin, Ô¨Çorphenicol and polymyxin B. Most of the Salmonella
isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic (66.7%; n ¬º 20) and
resistance was predominant towards trimethoprim (n ¬º 11; 36.7%),
followed by ampicillin (n ¬º 5; 16.7%), oxytetracycline (n ¬º 3; 10%),
and kanamycin (n ¬º 1; 3.3%). No multi-drug resistance (resistance
to 3 antimicrobial classes) was observed. Table 2 summarises the
resistance proÔ¨Åles of the isolates. S. Techimani isolates showed co-
resistance to trimethoprim/oxytetracycline (n ¬º 2) and trimetho-
prim/ampicillin (n ¬º 1).

In South Africa, the issue of antimicrobial resistance is outlined

(Mendelson & Matsoso, 2015). The initiatives include Global Anti-
biotic Resistance Partnership (GARP) in South Africa (GARP-SA),
South African Antibiotic Stewardship Programme (SAASP), Infec-
tion Prevention and Control and National Core Standards (IPC and
NCS), and Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). Antimi-
crobial resistance is an important ‚Äòone health‚Äô challenge because it
affects animal health, human health and the environment, hence it
is imperative to develop a national plan that speciÔ¨Åcally targets the
use of antibiotics in animal production. On-the-farm solutions to
curbing Salmonella spp antibiotic resistance among goats, pigs and
chicken among smallholder farmers could be guided by activities of
the European Innovation Partnership for Agricultural Productivity
and Sustainability (EIP-AGRI). Antibiotic resistance could be mini-
mised through reducing the amount of antibiotic use by improving
the general health and welfare of animals (European Innovation
Partnership for Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability (EIP-
AGRI). This could be done through improving management, bio-
security and education and training of personnel including farmers,
farm workers and veterinarians (EIP-AGRI). In addition, particular
‚Äòalternatives to antibiotics‚Äô such as breeding and feeding using
speciÔ¨Åc approaches (control) of feed supplies and vaccination could

Furthermore,
enhanced information dissemination and changing the behaviour

(EIP-AGRI).

This study illustrated that pigs, chickens and goats owned by
smallholder farmers are a source of diverse Salmonella serovars,
including unexpected isolates that were not reported previously in
South Africa. The diverse Salmonellas serovars could be a source of
disease burden among animals and humans. Despite relatively low
prevalence, the high proportion of antimicrobial resistant Salmo-
nella spp isolated from food animals highlights the need for pru-
dent use of antibiotics. These Ô¨Åndings highlight the need for robust
national surveillance and control programmes for Salmonella and
antibiotic resistance in animal production as this will make a pos-
itive contribution to the ‚Äòone health‚Äô initiative.

4. Limitations of the study

This study did not establish whether there is a clear relationship
between antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance in pigs, goats and
chicken in the study areas. It will be important to obtain data on
