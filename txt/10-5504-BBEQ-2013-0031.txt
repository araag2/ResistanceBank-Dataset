ABSTRACT
Shiga-toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is recognized as an important foodborne pathogen responsible for sporadic 
cases to serious outbreaks worldwide. The morbidity and mortality associated with several recent outbreaks due to STEC have 
highlighted the threat this organism poses to public health. This study was conducted to identify, characterize the virulence traits 
and antibiogram of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) from different sources. A total of 384 samples from human, animal and 
environmental sources were collected from different locations in Ismailia city, Egypt.  E. coli isolates (n = 283) were identified 
by conventional microbiology culture, and phenotypically characterized with biochemical and motility tests. Multiplex PCR 
(mPCR) was applied for the detection of virulence genes (stx1, stx2, eaeA, and EHEC hlyA). From the overall prevalence of E. 
coli isolates, 31 % (89/283) were isolated from stools of people with diarrhea; 17.3 % (49/283) were from stools of sheep, cattle 
and chicken with diarrhea; 16.5 % (47/283) were from urine of peple with a urinary tract infection; 17.3 % (49/283) were from 
fresh water; 6.4 % (18/283) from seafood; 6.02 % (17/283) from processed meat products; 3.9 % (11/283) from dairy products; 
and 1.1 % (3/283) from poultry products (liver). The antibiotic sensitivity pattern showed that the isolates carried a multidrug 
resistance (MDR) phenotype to at least four antibiotics from different classes: erythromycin (E), gentamicin (CN), cefazolin 
(CZ), thiampinicol (TP), vancomycin (VA), ciprofloxacin (CIP), and ampicillin (AM). Shiga toxin was identified in ten suspected 
EHEC by mPCR. Serotyping of these 10 E. coli isolates demonstrated the circulation of five serotypes (O157, O158, O114, O125 
and O26) (10/283 [4%]): three isolates from people (serotype O157, O158), four isolates from animals (serotype O114, O26), 
two isolates from meat products (serotype O125, O158), and an isolate from fresh water (serotype O114). This study identified 
STEC O157 from human cases with diarrhea, and demonstrated that meat and water were contaminated with more than one 
serotype of non-O157 STEC strains. This is a cause of concern owing to their potential to cause human infections.

Introduction
enterohemorrhagic  Escherihia  coli  (ehec)  is  the  most 
important recently emerged group of foodborne pathogens (17, 
24). it can cause severe gastrointestinal disease, including fatal 
infections, and is being detected more frequently worldwide. 
transmission  occurs  through  consumption  of  undercooked 
meat,  unpasteurized  dairy  products  and  vegetables  or  water 
3834

contaminated  with  feces  of  carriers  (20),  primarily  because 
Shiga-toxin–  producing E. coli  (Stec)  are  found  as  part  of 
the normal intestinal flora of animals (23). Person-to-person 
transmission  has  also  been  documented  (36,  49). Although, 
several investigations have been carried out on the laboratory 
diagnosis of these organisms in recent years, this group still 
remains  the  most  difficult  to  detect.  EHEC  strains  not  only 
produce potent cytotoxins (verotoxins), but have also acquired 
the  ability  to  adhere  to  the  intestinal  mucosa  in  an  intimate 
fashion (7, 24, 30, 47). A common characteristic of all ehec 
strains  is  the  production  of  an  EHEC-specific  plasmid-
mediated  hemolysin  encoded  by  the  hlyA  gene  (52)  and  at 
least one Shiga-like toxin (encoded by stx1or stx2) (47). Many 
produce intimin, a 97 kDa attachment- and-effacement protein 
that is encoded by the eaeA gene (42). 

the  present  study  aimed  at  investigating  the  prevalence 
of  Stec  strains  from  different  human  and  environmental

characteristics  and  antimicrobial  susceptibility  were  also 
studied.

Materials and Methods
Sample collection
A total number of 384 samples were collected from different 
sources  in  ismailia  city,  egypt.  Sampling  included  various 
types of food, water and clinical samples represented by stool 
and urine to survey the prevalence and distribution of ehec in 
the collected samples.

Food. A total of 99 food samples were obtained randomly 
in plastic bags from different local markets. the food products 
included meat products, poultry products, seafood and dairy 
products. Twenty-five grams of each sample were combined 
with 225 mL of modified tryptic soy broth mTSB and incubated 
with agitation (120 rpm) for 24 h at 37 °c as described (18, 
22). After  24  h  enrichment,  aliquots  of  100  μL  were  plated 
onto eosin Methylene Blue (eMB) to presumptively identify 
isolates as Gram-negative enteric bacteria and E. coli (green-
metallic  colonies),  and  onto  Sorbitol  Macconkey  agar 
(SMAc) to test for sorbitol non-fermenting bacteria (colorless 
colonies). After 18 h to 24 h at 37 °c, characteristic colonies 
from eMB agar (green-metallic colonies) and SMAc agar were 
transferred onto tryptic Soy agar (Difco) for the biochemical 
identification.

Water.  thirty-one  water  samples  were  collected  from 
ismailia  freshwater  canal  and  examined  according  to  the 
standard  methods  described  by  APhA  (4).  typical  green 
metallic  colonies  were  introduced  into  SMAc  agar  and 
incubated at 37 °c for 24 h (4).

Stool. Fecal specimens were collected following standard 
methods described elsewhere (11, 12). Stool specimens were 
collected  at  the  early  stages  of  enteric  illness  from  patients 
with  diarrhea  to  ensure  that  pathogens  are  usually  abundant 
in the stool and before antibiotic therapy has been started. A 
fresh stool sample, or a rectal swab from a fresh specimen was 
collected with a sterile rectal swab and inoculated into tryptic 
soy  broth  transport  medium  (11).  Upon  arrival  to  the  lab, 
samples were streaked onto sorbitol Macconkey agar (Difco, 
USA)  culture  plates  supplemented  with  0.05  mg/L  cefixime 
in  order  to  examine  the  sorbitol  fermentation  activity. After 
24 h at 37°c, plates were examined and individual E. coli-like 
colonies  with  a  pink/pale  color  were  selected  and  subjected 
to further identification using biochemical standard procedures 
(18).

Urine. Specimens (n = 76, 24 from male patients and 52 
from female patients) were collected from the midstream urine 
(MSU) of symptomatic cases with an urinary tract infection 
(Uti).  Within  few  hours  after  collection,  all  urine  samples 
were  examined  following  standard  procedures  (32).  Urine 
specimens were diluted with 5 % saline solution, by treating 
10 µl of urine with 190 µl of saline solution. then, 100 µl 
from each diluted sample was directly used to inoculate eMB 
Biotechnol. & Biotechnol. eq. 27/2013/3

culture  agar  plates.  Using  a  sterile  loop,  grown  bacterial 
colonies were restreaked onto Cefixime Sorbitol MacConkey 
agar plates, and incubated for 24 h at 37 °c.
Phenotype characterization
Identification of the isolates. Purified suspected E. coli-like 
colonies (n = 283) were identified by examining the morphology 
of growing colonies on both eMB agar, and Mcconkey Agar 
plates.  Gram-staining  properties  were  determined  following 
the  procedure  described  by  Merchant  and  Packer  (45),  and. 
E. coli-like colonies were subjected to different biochemical 
tests, including sugar fermentation test, indole production test, 
Methyl-Red  and  Voges–Proskauer  (iMiVc)  tests,  following 
the standard methods described in cowan (18).

clindamycin, 

erythromycin, 

Antibiotic  susceptibility  test.  the  total  number  of  E. 
coli isolates (n = 283) were tested for their susceptibility to 
16  antimicrobial  agents:  augmentin,  ampicillin,  cefazolin, 
ciprofloxacin, 
gentamicin, 
imipenem,  nitrofurantion,  nitrofloxacin,  penicillin,  rifampin, 
spectinomycin,  tetracycline,  thiampinicol,  vancomycin.  the 
test was performed on Mueller–hinton Agar and the Kirby–
Bauer disk diffusion technique was used (33). the antibiogram 
of each E. coli colony was determined based on the breakpoints 
of  the  inhibition  zone  diameters  for  individual  antibiotic 
agents  and  as  recommended  by  the  disk  manufacturer.  the 
results  were  interpreted  according  to  the  guidelines  of  the 
national committee for clinical laboratory Standards (16) for 
antimicrobial  susceptibility  testing  (16).  Resistance  to  more 
than four antibiotics was taken as MDR. MDRi of individual 
isolates was calculated by dividing the number of antibiotics 
to  which  the  isolate  was  resistant  by  the  total  number  of 
antibiotics to which the isolate was exposed (13):

isolates with MDRi  values of over 0.2 % or 20  % were 

considered highly resistant.

Congo red (CR) binding assay. this test was used to test 
the individual E. coli isolates for their binding activity with the 
congo red dye as a marker indicative for intestinal invasion 
(6, 39, 48). individual E. coli colonies were cultured on congo 
red medium and incubated at 37 ºc for 24 h. culture plates 
were then transferred at room temperature for additional 24 h 
incubation.  Growth  of  red  colonies  indicates  congo-red–
positive (cR+) E. coli results. Different intensities in the dye 
uptake were scored as (+), (++) and (+++), while appearance of 
white colonies (E. coli which did not uptake the dye) indicates 
Congo-red–negative (CR−) E. coli.

Enterohemolysin 

(EHL)  production.  Detection  of 
hemolysin E. coli producers was performed according to the 
method  described  in  Beutin  et  al.  (8)  and  Blanco  et  al.  (9). 
Briefly, individual E. coli colonies were grown at 37 ºc for 24 h 
on tryptose blood agar (Difco) supplemented with 10 mmol/l 
cacl2 and 5 % washed defibrinated sheep blood in phosphate

completely clear zone under and around the colonies.
Detection of virulence genes
DNA template preparation
Boiling  method.  DnA  lysate  was  prepared  by  the  boiling 
method as described by Fragan et al. (24). A 1.0 ml aliquot 
of  l.B  culture  of  each  E.  coli  isolate  was  centrifuged  in  a 
1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube at 7000 rpm for 10 min and the 
supernatant  was  discarded.  the  cell  pellet  was  resuspended 
in 400 µl of sterile de-ionized water and boiled for 15 min 
to  20  min,  and  the  insoluble  material  was  removed  by 
centrifugation for 5 min. the supernatant was collected and 
stored at -20 °c until further testing.

Genomic  DNA.  Total  purified  genomic  bacterial  DNA 
was  extracted  from  overnight  cultures  of E. coli  isolates  on 
trypticase  Soya Agar  tSA,  with  a  genomic  DnA  mini  kit 
(qiAGen,  qiAamp,  USA)  according  to  the  manufacturer’s 
instructions.

PCR assay for virulence genes. the DnA templates of 283 
samples were subjected to mPCR for screening of virulence 
genes  stx1  and  stx2,  eae  A  and  hyl  A  genes,  with  specific 
primers  as  described  elsewhere  (Table  1).  Positive  controls 
included DnA lysate prepared from clinical specimens positive 
for Shigella dysentery (WS15443); and eae and hlyA, which 
were  kindly  provided  by  US  naval  Medical  Research  Unit 
#3  (nAMRU-3)  laboratories,  cairo,  egypt. the  production 
of enterohemolysin was assayed on 75 E. coli isolates which 
had demonstrated a beta-hemolytic phenotype. the invasion 
capability was tested only on shiga-toxin–producing strains by 
eae A specific primers.

PCR cycle conditions. PcRs for detection of stx1, stx2, 
eae  and  hlyA  genes  were  performed  with  commercially 
manufactured  oligonucleotide  primers.  Primers  and  the 
predicted  lengths  of  PCR  amplification  products  are  listed 
in Table 1. these primers were chosen because they amplify 
conserved  regions  of  the  target  genes  and  allow  single-step 
identification of amplified DNA fragments that are visualized 
as stained bands after migration on agarose gel electrophoresis. 
PcRs were performed in 25 µl reaction mixture containing 
2  µl  of  template  DnA,  5  µl  of  5x  PcR  buffer,  4  µl  of  a 
2.5 mmol/l mixture of deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 2 µl 
of 25 mmol/l Mgcl2, 0.25 µl of 5 U Ampli taq Gold DnA 
polymerase per microliter, and 2 µl of a 20 µmol/l solution 
of each primer. the thermo-cycling conditions were done in a 
Gene Amp PcR system 9700 (AB Applied Biosystems).

Gel electrophoresis. PcR products (5 µl) were evaluated 
in 2 % agarose gel at 120 mV for 30 min. A molecular marker 
(1  kb  DnA  ladder;  Gibco/BRl)  was  run  concurrently. the 
DnA bands were visualized and photographed under UV light 
after the gel was stained with ethidium bromide.
Serotyping analysis
Serotyping  for  somatic  “o”  antigen  of  E.  coli  cultures 
propagated  in  an  18  h  nutrient  broth  culture  at  37  °c  was 
3836

in 

determined  commercially 
the  clinical  Microbiology 
Reference Unit, central health laboratories (cairo, egypt). 
Slide  agglutination  test  (39)  was  used,  with  8  diagnostic 
polyvalent  and  43  corresponding  monovalent  anti-coli  sera 
provided by Denka Seiken (Japan). the strains which failed 
to give agglutination results with any of the available antisera 
were recorded as non-typeable strains.

Results and Discussion
Stec cause cases of diarrhea, bloody diarrhea and hemorrhagic 
colitis.  Stec 
infection  also  causes  hemolytic-uremic 
syndrome (hUS), a life-threatening condition characterized by 
hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure (56). 
transmission  of  Stec  occurs  through  contaminated  foods, 
such  as  ground  beef,  through  contaminated  water  and  by 
person-to-person spread (52, 55). in some countries, o157:h7 
(o157) is the most common serotype of Stec (26) and is the 
serotype most often associated with hUS (57). Approximately 
150  non-o157  Stec  serotypes  also  cause  diarrheal  disease 
(44, 50). Some studies suggest that non-o157 Stec infection 
causes milder disease than o157 infection (10). Most of the 
medical  significance  reports  on  O157  STEC  are  published 
in  developed  countries,  and  only  a  handful  of  reports  are 
available  in  developing  countries,  with  nearly  no  data 
available on non-o157 Stec from countries in north Africa 
and the Middle East. The aim of the present study was, first, to 
identify the frequencies of o157 and non o157 Stec among 
different  human,  animal  and  environmental  sources;  and, 
second, to characterize in more details the genetic background 
and virulence traits of suspected Stec isolates.

A  total  of  283  E.  coli  isolates  were  recovered  from  384 
samples  collected  from  different  sources  in  ismailia  city, 
egypt,  one  of  the  largest  governorates  located  in  the  north 
east  of  egypt,  on  the  west  bank  of  the  Suez  canal.  the 
prevalence of E. coli isolates among the different sources is 
demonstrated  in  Table  2. the  prevailing  part  of  the  E.  coli 
isolates were obtained from human stools (31.43 %), animal 
stools  (17.3  %),  human  urine  (16.5  %),  fresh  water  (8.0%), 
and processed meat products (6.1 %), while a lower percent of 
E. coli isolates was from dairy products (3.9 %), and poultry 
products (1.1 %). Seventy percent (n = 194) of the 283 E. coli 
isolates  clearly  demonstrated  an  invasive  phenotype  on  cR 
agar, while 26 % (n = 75) showed a beta-hemolytic pattern on 
Blood agar. An invasive pattern was recorded in considerably 
high ratios: 86 % of the isolates from diarrheic animals, 83 % 
of those from seafood isolates, 82 % of the isolates from meat 
products, 77 % of the ones from Uti patients, and 73 % of 
the  isolates  from  diarrheic  patients.  the  beta-hemolytic 
phenotype  was  widespread  among  the  isolates  from  various 
food  products:  poultry  (66  %),  processed  meat  (47  %),  and 
seafood (33 %). twenty-two percent (n = 61) of the isolates 
shared a common phenotype with respect to the presence of 
both an invasive pattern on cR and beta-hemolytic activity. 
Fourteen of these 61 isolates were from human stools, 16 from 
animal stools, 13 from Uti patients, 6 from fresh water, 10

from meat products, 1 from poultry, and 1 from seafood. these 
percentages were near to those obtained by other authors (1, 
31, 51) who found that a positive congo red and hemolysin 
profile  were  widespread  among E. coli  strains  isolated from 
diseased  animals.  in  our  study,  most  of  the  cR-  and  ehl-
positive strains were observed in clinical samples isolated from 
patients with diarrhea and Uti, which indicates the potential of 
these strains to cause disease and corroborates with findings 
described elsewhere (29), emphasizing the role of hemolysin-
producing E. coli in the increased pathogenic potential and the 
critical  role  these  organisms  play  in  causing  extra-intestinal 
infection.

the antibiogram pattern of the 283 E. coli isolates shown in 
Table 3 indicates that antibiotic resistance is common among 
most of the E. coli isolates. the results demonstrated that 75 % 
(n = 211) of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin, followed 
by 69 % (n = 195) resistant to vancomycin, 64 % (n = 180) 
to penicillin, and 60 % (n = 169) to erthromycin. the results 
showed that near 50 % of the tested isolates were augmentin 
resistant. less common was the resistance to noR (36 %) and 
iPM (28 %). the antibiograms of the E. coli strains carrying 
different virulence genes is given in Table 4. Most strains had 
a significantly high MDRI, demonstrating resistance to at least 
four  antibiotics  belonging  to  different  classes:    e,  cn,  cZ, 
tP, VA, ciP, and AM. Strains from the o157 serotype were 
sensitive to ciP and noR, while 30 % of the non-o157 strains 

3838

were found to be resistant to ciP, and 90 % showed MDR to at 
least three antibiotics.

laboratories.  Key 

issues  concerning 

the  detection  of  ehec  poses  a  challenge  for  clinical 
microbiology 
their 
detection  include  the  need  to  distinguish  ehec  from 
commensal varieties of E. coli (5, 21). the currently accepted 
method for detection is direct plating on SMAc or other media 
such as cefixime-SMAC or SMAC supplemented with cefixime 
and tellurite (ct-SMAc) (51). culture on SMAc is a simple 
method for screening for ehec o157, but it cannot identify 
non-o157 serotypes. the multiplex PcR approach for detection 
of stx1, stx2, eaeA and ehec hlyA genes, is advantageous for 
rapid detection of ehec pathogenicity factors and is highly 
recommended. our study demonstrates that non-o157 Stec 
strains compose a significant proportion (70 %) of all STEC 
strains  detected.  SMAc  culture  was  selected  for  detection 
of Stec, and 10 Stec strains primarily appeared as typical 
E.  coli  colonies  (pink-red),  and  could  not  be  differentiated 
from  other  pathogenic  or  non-pathogenic  (commensal)  E. 
coli which grow on the same medium. We applied the PcR 
assay for Shiga- toxin detection and found the assay to be an 
excellent, sensitive, and specific tool for accurate detection of 
Stec related both to o157 and to non-o157 serotypes. our 
data support the consideration of others for the mandated use 
of a Shiga-toxin assay for the identification of STEC (37).

Ten  Shiga-toxin–producing  strains  were  identified  by 
mPcR  screening  of  a  total  of  283  E.  coli  isolates. three  of

the  ten  isolates  (ec255:o157,  ec306:o158,  ec322:o114) 
were positive for both stx1 and stx2. Fig. 1 demonstrates the 
two PcR bands of stx2 (110 bp) and stx1 (349 bp). the other

ec357:o114,  ec291:o26,  ec158:o158,  ec94:o157)  were 
positive  for  stx1  (Fig.  1).  the  ten  Shiga-toxin–producing 
strains were tested for the eaeA virulence gene as a marker 
indicative for intestinal invasion. three of them were positive 
for the eae gene with a 890 bp band size (Fig. 2). in addition, 
PcR testing of the 75 beta-hemolytic E. coli isolates yielded 
two hlyA positive strains with a 165 bp band size (Fig. 3).

When  only  a  Shiga-toxin  assay  is  used,  it  is  important 
to  subculture  the  positive  samples  for  Stec  detection  and 
serotyping, in order to identify and limit potential outbreaks of 
Stec infection. We were able to identify molecular markers 
(stx1, stx2 and hlyA) for ehec in the ten Stec isolates, which 
represented 4 % of the total isolates. three strains carried both 
stx1 and stx2, seven strains carried stx1 only, one strain carried 
stx1, stx2 and hlyA, and three strains carried stx1 and eaeA. it 
was of a particular concern to find that all the 10 STEC with 
o157 and non-o157 serotypes were positive for both cR and 
hemolysis tests on blood agar, indicating that both serotypes 
possess  similar  virulent  phenotypic  characteristics.  Most 
studies  of  o157  and  non-o157  Stec  have  included  mixed 
populations of adults and children (10, 11). While outbreaks 
of non-o157 Stec have been reported in children (22), and 
in 38 % of Stec infections among a pediatric cohort (38), our 
results identified seven STEC strains that were isolated from 
clinical samples, of which four were isolated from stools of 
diarrheic animals and two (o157 and non-o157) were from 
adult patients with Uti and one (o157) was from the stool 
of a diarrheic child under 5 years of age. Data collected from 
multiple sites in the world showed that the highest incidence of 
both E. coli o157 infection and hUS occurred among 5-year-
old  children  and  that  the  median  age  of  patients  with  hUS 
was  4  years  (26).  nevertheless,  the  incidence  of  non-o157 
Stec infection and the clinical squeal need to be more clearly 
defined (38). E. coli accounts for the majority of urinary tract 
infections in young adults and pregnant women (34). ehec 
causing hemolytic colitis (hc) (35), a severe form of diarrhea, 
has been associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome (hUS), 
which  may  progress  in  some  patients  to  renal  failure  (41). 
hUS is a life-threatening condition especially among children 

3840

and elderly people (40). in nigeria, Akinduti et al. (3) isolated 
ehec  serotype  o157:h7  from  urine  samples  of  adult  male 
and female patients suffering from severe Uti. the authors 
reported a very high prevalence (46.4 %) of E. coli 0157:h7 (n 
= 372, out of 1205) among the tested patients, demonstrating 
that renal diseases associated with severe UTI were majorly 
caused  by  E.  coli  o157:h7.  the  percent  of  Stec  in  our 
clinical samples from Uti cases is notably high, considering 
the small number of Uti cases (n = 47) included in the study. 
To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  report  from 
egypt  to  identify  non-o157  Stec  from  patients  with  Uti, 
which  recommends  further  community  and  hospital-based 
surveillance studies to better estimate the prevalence of ehec 
in this region and their impact on disease complexity. christina 
et al. (15) surveyed 5110 children for Stec at the children’s 
hospital Boston and demonstrated that 50 cases (0.9 %) had 
confirmed STEC infection; 33 were O157:H7 and 17 were non-
o157:h7 belonging to different serotypes, such as o25:h11, 
o26:h11, o26:h28, o111: nonmotile, o118:h16, o126:h1, 
o130:h11,  o145:  nonmotile,  and  o146:h28.  however, 
there  were  no  significant  differences  in  disease  severity 
or  laboratory  manifestations  of  Stec  infection  between 
children with o157:h7 and those with non-o157 Stec. our 
survey identified a comparable percent in the distribution of 
non-o157 serotypes as those reported by christina et al. (15): 
we  identified  that  four  different  non-O157  serotypes,  which 
belonged to o158, o114, o125, and o26, were isolated from 
clinical samples, meat products and fresh water.

We  additionally  demonstrated  the  in  vivo  comparable 
toxicity  of  Shiga  toxin  derived  from  both  o157  and 
non-o157serotypes.  Serotyping  of  the  10  Stec  strains 
demonstrated the circulation of five serotypes (O157, O158, 
o114, o125 and o26) (Table 4): three isolates from people 
(serotype o157, o158), four isolates from animals (serotype 
o114, o26), two isolates from meat products (serotype o125, 
o158) and an isolate from fresh water (serotype o114). three 
Stec strains, belonging to three serotypes, positive for both 
stx1 and stx2 were isolated from a urine sample of a female 
patient  with  Uti  (serotype  o157),  a  stool  from  an  infected 
sheep  (serotype  o114)  and  from  a  meat  product  (serotype 
o158).

Stec  are  associated  with  a  broad  spectrum  of  human 
illnesses  throughout  the  world,  ranging  from  mild  diarrhea 
to hc, hUS and ttP. complications arising from antibiotic 
treatment of Stec-related human infections have also been 
reported  (19).  our  studies  on  the  antibiotic  susceptibility 
pattern for the 10 Stec strains indicated that all Shiga-toxin–
producing strains (o157 and non-o157) showed resistance to 
commonly  used  antibiotics  such  as  ampicillin,  vancomycin, 
penicillin,  erythromycin,  tetracycline,  augmentin,  cefazolin, 
and  ciprofloxacin.  In  addition,  a  considerably  high  MDRI 
phenotype was identified in both serotypes. It is of concern to 
find that 88 % (7/8) of the non-O157 strains showed resistance 
to ampicillin, of which six were MDR with e/t and 38 % were 
resistant to ciprofloxacin. The two O157 strains were resistant 

Biotechnol. & Biotechnol. eq. 27/2013/3

Downloaded by [University of Illinois Chicago] at 13:49 08 December 2014 to ampicillin and showed MDR to more than four antibiotics. 
the MDRi phenotype of both the o157 and non-o157 strains 
signifies that STEC are highly resistant to available antibiotics, 
limiting the selection of treatment choice. MDR among E. coli 
isolates has been subject of concern worldwide (14, 43).

Ground  beef  and  other  bovine  products  have  often  been 
implicated  as  sources  of  Stec  (27),  along  with  other  food 
products (2, 53, 54). occasional outbreaks of Stec have also 
been associated with public drinking water (55) and swimming 
in  contaminated  water  (25,  28,  46).  our  investigation  also 
demonstrated  that  of  three  non-o157  Stec  strains,  two 
(ec306:o158,  ec150:o125)  were  isolated  from  processed 
meat products and one (ec357:o114) from the main fresh water 
canal of ismailia. it is not clear whether the contamination of 
meat and water was of animal or human origin but conceivably, 
a combination of the above origins could explain the presence 
of Stec strains found in such isolates.

We are in the process of analyzing PFGe results of all Stec 
strains to compare the clonality and define the relatedness of 
the strains. in this study, most of the Stec strains were shown 
to  possess  a  combination  of  two  or  more  of  the  virulence 
factors (cR indicator, hemolysin production as well as stx1, 
stx2, hlyA and eaeA).

Conclusions
the  presence  of  multiple  virulence  factors  increases  the 
virulence  of  microorganisms,  since  such  factors  function 
synergistically to overcome and defeat normal host defenses. 
thus,  strains  with  more  virulence  factors  are  potentially 
considered as virulent pathogens. Our findings may imply that 
the isolates from the examined sources could be considered 
as potentially pathogenic. it is of interest that Stec serotype 
O104  was  not  identified  from  the  environmental  sources 
tested in the present study, as fenugreek imported from egypt 
was  blamed  as  the  most  likely  source  of  the  2011  Stec 
epidemic in Germany that fatally affected 49 people. one of 
the limitations of our investigation, however, is that we could 
not identify (H) flagellar antigen for the isolated STEC, since 
it  was  commercially  unavailable  at  the  time  of  our  study. 
Additionally, this is considered as a lab-based study and with 
the  small  number  of  disease  cases  involved  and  the  lack  of 
clinical data, we could not determine an association between 
disease severity and a specific STEC serotype.
