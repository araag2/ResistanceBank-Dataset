Abstract

Background and Aim: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the most recognized “superbugs” 
and a common cause of community-associated and nosocomial infections; furthermore, when chicken meat is considered 
a good growth medium for S. aureus to make a plausible vehicle to propagate MRSA, then this study was conducted to 
evaluate the efficiency of ozonated water (0.5 ppm) in the elimination or reduction of MRSA contaminating fresh and frozen 
chicken meat sold in local markets in the Wasit Province.
Materials and Methods: A total of 72 samples of fresh and frozen chicken meat were randomly collected from dissimilar 
native markets: Fresh chicken meat (n=32) and frozen chicken meat (n=40). Isolation and identification of MRSA isolates 
were conducted using standard bacteriological, biochemical, RapID™ Staph Plus System (Remel, R8311009), and latex 
agglutination tests such as Dry SPOT Staphytect Plus (Oxoid, DR0100M) and PBP2’ Test Kit (Oxoid, DR0900A). The 
generation of ozone (O3) was carried out using O3 generator (A2Z/AQUA-6, USA), and its concentration (ppm) in water 
was determined using CHE-Mets®-Kit, USA.
Results: A total of 39 (54.2%) of 72 fresh and frozen chicken meat were positive for S. aureus; of those 39 positive samples, 
13 (33.3%) were identified as MRSA. The antibiotic sensitivity test results revealed that all MRSA isolates had multiple 
resistance to at least four antimicrobial agents for which these isolates had 12 antibiotic resistance patterns. Results of O3 
treatment in MRSA isolate contaminating 13 of both fresh and frozen chicken meat samples showed that, after treatment 
with ozonated water (0.5 ppm/4°C), the overall negative samples were 23.1% and 69.2% for 30 and 45 min, respectively. 
The decrease in the percentage of positive samples was very significant from a public health perspective. Furthermore, the 
antimicrobial efficacy of ozonated water (0.5 ppm) on the reduction of the MRSA count (log10 colony-forming units [CFU]/ml) 
was assessed in four positive samples of fresh and frozen chicken meat, and the results revealed that, after treatments, the 
overall reduction was 2-4 log10 (CFU/ml) after 45 min. This reduction is highly significant from a public health perspective.
Conclusion: From the data obtained from this study, it can be concluded that fresh and frozen chicken meat sold in the 
different markets of Wasit Province was highly contaminated by S. aureus during the study period with a total prevalence 
of 54.2%; among those, 33.3% were recognized as MRSA. Under the conditions described in the present study, O3 at the 
concentration of 0.5 ppm is highly effective in reducing the number of MRSA-positive samples and the number decreased 
with increased exposure time to ozonated water at the same concentration. These findings indicated that O3 treatment might 
constitute the basis for an alternative method to reduce meat contamination with foodborne pathogens such as MRSA.

Introduction
The strains of S. aureus transmitted by food tend to 
be resistant to different types of antibiotics [4]. Today, 
methicillin-resistant  S.  aureus  (MRSA)  has  become 
a  serious  health  problem  due  to  its  high  resistance 
to different types of antibiotics [5]. MRSA has been 
found in several meat-producing animals throughout 
the  world,  including  pigs,  chickens,  and  cattle  [6]. 
The  prevalence  of  livestock-related  MRSA  in  farm 
animals is increasing, and the resulting foods may be 
contaminated [7]. On the other hand, the appearance 
of ST398 in bovine [8], CC398 and CC5 in poultry [9], 
and  the  probability  of  these  strains  to  cause  serious 
infections and even death in humans [10] demonstrate 
the importance to investigate meat products such as 
poultry  meat  as  possible  vehicles  for  the  transmis-
sion of MRSA at the consumer level [8]. Worldwide,

Staphylococcus aureus is an illustrious opportu-
nistic foodborne pathogen and is involved in numer-
ous nosocomial and community-associated outbreaks 
worldwide [1]. It is a dangerous bacterium consider-
ing its negative consequences for animal health and 
its  ability  to  transmit  from  animals  to  people  and 
vice versa [2]. In addition, toxigenic foodborne strains 
of S. aureus also pose a threat to humans who ingest

years due to its low-fat content, excellent quality pro-
tein,  quick  preparation,  and  cost-effectiveness  com-
pared to red meat [11]. The contamination of chicken 
meat  by  pathogenic  and  harmful  bacteria  occurs 
mainly during scalding, plucking, and evisceration of 
chicken carcasses. In addition, cross-contamination of 
processing water and equipment increase the opportu-
nity for contamination in the processing stages [12]. 
Therefore,  to  eliminate  bacterial  contaminants  in 
chicken meat, numerous processing techniques have 
been developed in the food industry, including chlo-
rine,  high-pressure  processing,  gamma  radiation, 
ultraviolet  radiation,  and  ozone  (O3)  [13].  Chlorine 
is widely used in the sanitation of poultry operations, 
and the use of chlorine is more scrutinized due to the 
problems of toxicity and disinfection byproducts that 
have proven to be harmful to food safety and from the 
environmental point of view [14].

Researchers  in  the  food  industry  are  trying  to 
find alternative cleaning and disinfecting agents that 
are effective against spoilage of food and pathogenic 
bacteria that are harmless to humans and the environ-
ment. These investigations of chlorine alternatives in 
poultry  operations,  particularly  in  the  chiller,  are  of 
interest  to  the  poultry  industry  [12].  O3  is  the  natu-
ral substance in the atmosphere that has involved the 
attention of food scientists as an alternative disinfec-
tant [15]. This gas can be applied in the food indus-
try  for  bacterial  elimination,  inactivation  of  viruses, 
and others [16,17]. Even if it does not leave harmful 
residues  in  the  treated  products,  it  decomposes  rap-
idly into oxygen [18]. The use of O3 increased after 
its designation as generally recognized as safe by the 
Food  and  Drug Administration  in  1997  [19].  It  has 
been reported that O3 eliminates foodborne pathogens 
such  as  Salmonella,  Listeria  monocytogenes,  and 
S. aureus [20]. Therefore, O3 is considered the most 
appropriate  for  the  elimination  of  microbes  of  food 
safety problems [21].

In  Iraq,  chicken  meat  is  considered  the  most 
popular  meat  in  many  communities,  and  due  to  the 
absence of data on the prevalence of MRSA in chicken 
meat, this study was conducted to investigate the level 
of  contamination  of  chicken  meat  with  MRSA  that 
would help in the evaluation of the effect of O3 treat-
ment on the microbiological safety of chicken meat 
sold in Wasit markets.
Materials and Methods
Ethical approval

Ethical approval is not necessary to pursue such 
type  of  study.  Meat  samples  were  collected  from 
markets.
Collection and processing of samples

From November 2017 to February 2018, a total 
of 72 samples of chicken meat, including fresh chicken 
meat  (n=32),  locally  produced  frozen  chicken  meat 
(n=20),  and  imported  frozen  chicken  meat  (n=20), 
Veterinary World, EISSN: 2231-0916 

were collected at random from several supermarkets 
and retailer stores. The samples were packaged in a 
sterilized  polyethylene  bag  and  sent  to  the  labora-
tory with ice packs in 3 h. The chicken samples were 
divided into two parts: The first portion was subjected 
to microbiological evaluation and the second portion 
was kept in a freezer at −18°C for further analysis.
Isolation and identification of S. aureus and MRSA

The  samples  were  analyzed  and  processed 
according  to  standard  food  microbiological  proce-
dures [22-24], with some modification. A portion of 
10 g was cut and transferred into the sterilized plastic 
bag, then supplemented with 90 ml of buffered peptone 
water (BPW) (Oxoid, CM0509), and homogenized in 
a  stomacher  for  3  min. About  5  ml  of  the  homoge-
nate was removed into 50 ml of Tryptone Soya Broth 
(Oxoid, CM0129) with 0.6% yeast extract (YE). After 
incubation  at  35°C  for  18  h,  20  µL  of  the  culture 
was plated onto Baird-Parker agar (Oxoid, CM1127) 
supplemented  by  Egg  Yolk  Tellurite  and  incubated 
overnight  at  37°C.  Colonies  exhibiting  typical  mor-
phological  characteristic  of  MRSA  on  Baird-Parker 
agar (bright black colonies surrounded by 2-4 mm clear 
zones after 48 h) were purified on Baird-Parker agar 
without supplement at 35°C for 24 h and preserved on 
Tryptic Soy Agar-YE at 4°C with 0.02% of thiomersal 
solution  [25].Further  identification  based  on  Gram-
staining,  fermentation  of  mannitol  salt  agar  (Oxoid, 
CM0085), activity of blood hemolysis on horse blood 
agar  (Oxoid,  CM0854),  catalase  activity,  coagulase 
test (rabbit and human plasma) was done [22-26]. In 
addition,  the  RapID™  Staph  Plus  System  (Remel, 
R8311009) was used to confirm the identification of 
S. aureus at the species level. The isolates of MRSA 
were identified using SPOT Staphytect Plus (Oxoid, 
DR0100M), which is a latex agglutination test for the 
detection of aggregation factor, protein A, and some 
polysaccharides  found  in  MRSA  isolates  [27].  The 
isolates were identified another time using PBP2’ Test 
Kit (Oxoid, DR0900A), which is a latex agglutination 
test for the rapid detection of PBP2a in the S. aureus 
isolates  whereby  agglutination  was  observed  within 
3 min indicating PBP2a positive (MRSA) [27].
Antibiotic sensitivity test of MRSA isolates

A  Kirby–Bauer  disk  diffusion  technique  on 
Mueller-Hinton agar (Oxoid, CM0337) according to 
the  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards  Institute  [28] 
was adopted to assess the antimicrobial susceptibility 
of the MRSA isolates against 10 antimicrobial agents: 
ME  (5  μg),  cefoxitin  (FOX)  30  μg,  oxacillin  (OX) 
1 μg, gentamicin (GM) 10 μg, ofloxacin 5 μg, erythro-
mycin (E) 15 μg, tetracycline (T) 30 μg, enrofloxacin 
(ENF)  5  μg,  vancomycin  (VAN)  30  μg,  and  fusidic 
acid (FA) 10 μg (Oxoid, UK).

39 (54.2%) of 72 were positive for S. aureus by which 
the prevalence of S. aureus isolates in fresh and fro-
zen chicken meat was 59.4% and 50%, respectively. 
Imported  chicken  meat  displayed  the  lowest  preva-
lence (45%), while fresh chicken meat had the high-
est prevalence (59.4%). Furthermore, the results also 
revealed that 13 (33.3%) of 39 S. aureus isolates were 
recognized  as  MRSA  with  isolation  percentages  of 
42.11%  and  25%  in  fresh  and  frozen  chicken  meat, 
respectively.

Antibiotic resistance patterns (ARP) of 13 MRSA 
isolates recovered from fresh and frozen chicken meat 
samples were scrutinized, and the results are shown 
in  Figure-1.  The  results  revealed  that  MRSA  iso-
lates presented high prevalence of resistance against 
ME  (100%),  OX  (92.3%),  FA  (92.3%),  E  (84.6%), 
and  FOX  (69.2%)  and  low  prevalence  of  resistance 
against T (46.2%), ENF (38.5%), GM (30.8%), VAN 
(23.07%),  and  OFL  (7.7%).  Data  analysis  revealed 
that  there  were  significant  differences  in  the  levels 
of resistance by chicken source only seen with FOX 
(p=0.05) and VAN (p=0.01) (Table-2). The acquired 
results  (Table-3)  revealed  that  all  MRSA  isolates 
(100%)  exhibited  multidrug  resistance  (MDR)  to  at 
least four antimicrobials by which these isolates dis-
played 12 ARPs (Table-3). Although no pattern was 
common  between  fresh  and  frozen  chicken  meat, 
two  isolates  (one  recovered  from  fresh  and  another 
recovered from frozen chicken) were resistant to nine 
antimicrobials,  with  which  the  fresh  MRSA  isolate 
offered resistance to six classes of antimicrobials and 
exhibited the MDR model of ME, FOX, OX, FA, E, T, 
GM, ENF, and OFL, while the frozen MRSA isolate 
offered  resistance  to  seven  classes  of  antimicrobials 
and  exhibited  the  MDR  model  of  ME,  VAN,  FOX, 
OX, FA, E, T, GM, and ENF.

The results (Table-4) revealed that, after treatment 
with ozonated water (0.5 ppm/30 min/4°C), three sam-
ples (23.1%) were negative (no bacterial growth on the 
surface of the agar) and 10 samples (76.9%) were posi-
tive (>100 colonies/plate), while after an extended time 
to 45 min, nine samples (69.2%) were negative and four 
samples  (30.8%)  were  positive  (<30  colonies/plate). 
To evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of ozonated water 
(0.5 ppm) on reducing the MRSA count (log10 CFU/ml), 

was  carried  out  using  O3  CHE-Mets®-Kit  and  as  a 
technique  implemented  by Abdulateef  [29].  Briefly, 
a  plastic  container  was  occupied  with  1.5  L  of  tap 
water  and  enclosed  by  its  cover. The  aeration  stone 
was injected into the container through a hole in the 
cover. 5 exposure times (contact times) were chosen 
(5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 min). After each exposure time, 
the tap water was altered, and the container flushed 
with  new  tap  water,  and  the  process  was  recurrent. 
The  empty  sample  cup  was  supplemented  with  five 
droplets  of A-7400 Activator  and  then  filled  to  the 
25  ml  mark  with  the  ozonated  water,  the  CHEMet 
ampoule tip was located into the cup, and the tip of 
the ampoule was broken and occupied by the ozonated 
water, then inverted several times, and left for 1 min 
for  color  change. The  ampoule  was  placed  between 
the color standards until the best color was matched 
by high range comparator [29]. The highest concen-
tration among the 5 times used was got at 15, 30, and 
45 min, which was 0.5 ppm/in water.
The effect of ozonated water (0.5 ppm) on MRSA

The  second  portion  of  each  positive  sample  of 
chicken  meat  (from  the  first  step)  was  exposed  to 
the second step. In this test, O3 gas was injected into 
the water using aeration stone (Diffuser) and spread 
evenly through the water. The O3 generator was sup-
plied with 1 L/min (600 mg/h) of compressed air as 
a feed gas. The samples were deiced in a refrigerator 
overnight  and  then  submerged  into  ozonated  water 
at  4°C.  The  ozonated  water  was  spread  within  the 
chicken meat samples for 2 different experience times 
(30  and  45  min). A  portion  of  10  g  of  each  sample 
was chopped and moved into a sterile plastic bag and 
treated as described previously. The bactericidal effect 
of  O3  was  achieved  using  the  method  of  Miles  and 
Misra  [30],  through  estimating  the  number  of  colo-
ny-forming units (CFU) in a bacterial suspension in 
which a sequence of decimal 10 dilutions of enrich-
ment broths was diluted with sterile BPW tubes (1 ml 
broth/9  ml  BPW),  and  then,  5  drops×20  μl  of  each 
dilution sequence was let fall onto Baird-Parker agar 
and let dry before incubation at 37°C for 24 h. The 
microbial load log titer was calculated as follows:

CFU per ml=Average number of colonies for a 

dilution×50×dilution factor [30].
Statistical analysis

The effect of the variables (antibiotics) on MRSA 
isolates  based  on  chicken  source  was  determined 
using Chi-square test through Statistical Package for 
the Social Sciences ver. 18.0 (IBM,USA). The signifi-
cant differences among variables (p-value) in any test 
were as follows:

S=Significant difference (p<0.05).
NS=Non-significant difference (p>0.05).

Discussion

Contamination  of  meat  with  S.  aureus  can 
occur  directly  from  infected  animals  destined  for 
food  production  or  can  occur  as  a  result  of  human 
contamination  by  poor  hygiene  procedures  during 
production  processes  as  humans  can  also  harbor 
microorganisms [31]. Cross-contamination of chicken 
meat can also occur due to poor hygienic and storage 
conditions of these products [32]. This study was car-
ried out to imply that MRSA contamination of chicken 
meat sold in the Wasit markets is not rare.

In  this  study,  the  prevalence  of  S.  aureus  in 
chicken meat was determined as 54.2%. This finding 
is similar to that obtained by Krupa et al. [33] who 
found that the prevalence of S. aureus in chicken meat 
is >52% and up to 93%. The prevalence of S. aureus 
in chicken meat samples of this study was higher than 
that of the USA (17.8%) [8], Egypt (21.4%) [34], and 
Romania (7.5%) [35].

The higher prevalence (59.4%) of S. aureus in 
fresh  chicken  meat  during  this  study  can  be  traced 
back to the fact that, in Iraq, most chickens are sold in 
plucking markets that lack hygienic measures which 
lead  to  increase  the  possibilities  for  the  contamina-
tion of slaughtered chicken with S. aureus. Moreover, 
the relatively higher prevalence (55%) of S. aureus in 
local frozen chicken meat may be attributed to poor 
performance  of  slaughter  operations  which  lead  to 
increase the contamination potential. Furthermore, the 
results also revealed that 33.3% of S. aureus isolates 
were recognized as MRSA. This finding is similar to 
that reported by Dehkordi et al. [4]. In their study in 
Iran, the authors found that chicken meat had the high-
est prevalence of MRSA among other hospital food 
samples up to 32.43%. The prevalence of MRSA in 
S. aureus isolated from chicken meat samples of this 
research was higher than that of the USA (26%) [36], 
Canada (1.2%) [37], Germany (25.0%) [38], and Brazil 
(23.30%) [39]. A comparison between numerous stud-
ies can be difficult due to the wide variety of factors 
that  contribute  to  the  differences  observed  between 
the studies such as differences in culture methodolo-
gies and differences in the sampling techniques, and 
the type of sample (whole chicken or minced chicken 
meat) should also be considered.

The presence of resistant bacteria in chickens can 
lead to their presence in chicken carcasses and their 
products,  which  poses  a  risk  to  human  health  [40].

All MRSA isolates in this study showed a high prev-
alence of resistance to beta-lactams, FA, and E, while 
these isolates exhibited a low prevalence of resistance 
against T, ENF, GM, VAN, and OFL (Figure-1).

The  increased  resistance  to  beta-lactams  (ME, 
OX, and FOX) could be related to the widespread usage 
of penicillin in livestock and poultry as feed additives 
and growth promoters, while resistance against mac-
rolides could be attributed to application of spiramy-
cin which is most commonly used for the promotion of 
growth in poultry production [41]; this use may sup-
port the selection of resistance to E in MRSA isolates 
due  to  cross-resistance  relations  among  the  chemi-
cally related antimicrobials. Resistance to tetracycline 
can be credited to its wide use in the prophylaxis and 
therapy of human and animal infections and as addi-
tives  for  livestock  and  poultry  [42].  Moreover,  the 
antimicrobial-resistant  bacteria  such  as  Enterococci 
Veterinary World, EISSN: 2231-0916 

spp.  were  detected  in  numerous  food  samples  such 
as frozen broiler meat [42], and these bacteria exhibit 
resistance  to  several  antibiotics  such  as  bacitracin, 
ciprofloxacin,  E,  streptomycin,  T,  and  VAN,  which 
may be allocated the resistance to MRSA against these 
antimicrobials [43]. This finding is supported by the 
results recently obtained by Elmal and Can [44]. In 
their study in Turkey, they found that broiler meat was 
more  commonly  contaminated  with  vancomycin-re-
sistant Enterococci among all other experienced food 
samples with the prevalence of 57.1%.

On the other hand, VAN was considered a magic 
drug for the treatment of resistant S. aureus to β-lac-
tams,  and  this  could  be  explained  the  significant 
effect (p=0.01) for VAN on MRSA isolates (Table-2). 
Resistance  to  fluoroquinolone  among  S.  aureus  iso-
lates could be attributed to its use as prophylaxis in the 
poultry  productions,  which  may  have  been  selected 
1449

Available at www.veterinaryworld.org/Vol.11/October-2018/14.pdffor  resistant  strains  to  fluoroquinolones  that  exist 
today  [45].  The  onset  of  resistance  to  GM  may  be 
related to the use of apramycin (aminoglycoside, struc-
turally related to GM) for veterinary treatment [46].

The finding of antibiotic resistance profile of this 
study  is  in  accordance  with  the  previous  reports  of 
Dehkordi et al. [4]. In their study in Iran, the authors 
found  that  the  prevalence  of  antibiotic  resistance  in 
MRSA isolates against penicillin, ceftaroline, T, GM, 
E,  ciprofloxacin,  levofloxacin,  and  rifampicin  was 
100%, 100%, 100%, 80%, 80%, 40%, 40%, and 20%, 
respectively.  Another  study  conducted  by  Waters 
et  al.  [36]  in  which  they  documented  a  high  preva-
lence  of  resistance  in  S.  aureus  isolates  recovered 
from  meat  and  poultry  products  against  β-lactams 
(penicillin and OX), T, fluoroquinolones, daptomycin, 
and VAN. Furthermore, Jackson et al. [47] reported 
that the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in MRSA 
isolated from beef meat against ciprofloxacin, E, gati-
floxacin, levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and 
T  was  100%,  100%,  100%,  100%,  75%,  25%,  and 
25%, respectively.

The  acquired  results  (Table-3)  revealed  that  all 
MRSA  isolates  (100%)  exhibited  MDR  to  at  least 
four antimicrobials. Multiple drug resistance has been 
defined  as  an  isolate  that  displays  resistance  to  three 
or  more  antimicrobials  simultaneously  [47].  Multi-
resistance can be attributed to the presence of some resis-
tance genes commonly found in Staphylococci that help 
to explain the spread of resistance to antibiotics [47]. 
In addition, MDR may reflect the acquisition of differ-
ent elements of resistance in the same DNA molecule 
or unique elements, such as multidrug pumps, which 
specify the activity of the antibiotic efflux pumps incor-
porated in the membrane against numerous antimicro-
bial agents [48]. The mechanisms of genetic resistance 
could  be  chromosomal  or  plasmidic  and  represent  a 
combination of endogenous and acquired genes [49].

MDR to at least three antimicrobials in MRSA 
isolated from retail meat was previously detectable by 
Jackson et al. [47] who found that all MRSA isolates 
exhibited  MDR  to  at  least  three  antimicrobials,  and 
two classes of antibiotics of that 28.6 % of the iso-
lates exhibited resistance to nine antimicrobials with 
the percentages of 14.3%, 14.3%, and 42.9% for the 
MDR model of AMP GEN PEN, AMP CIP ERY GAT 
PEN, and AMP CEF CIP ERY GAT LEV OXA PEN, 
respectively. Daka et al. [50] reported that the preva-
lence of MDR in MRSA isolated from milk samples 
to 3 or 4, 6, and 7 antimicrobials was 51%, 42.9%, and 
6.1%, respectively. Furthermore, Momtaz et al. [51] 
found that 31.69% of the S. aureus isolates recovered 
from chicken meat were exhibited MDR against three 
or  more  antibiotics.  Rong  et  al.  [52]  in  their  inves-
tigation  found  that  90.6%  of  the  S.  aureus  isolates 
recovered from aquatic products displayed resistance 
to three or more antimicrobial agents.

O3  is  used  in  a  wide  variety  of  agricultural 
products  such  as  vegetables,  fruits,  and  fish.  It  is 
Veterinary World, EISSN: 2231-0916 

characterized by a high oxidation potential that trans-
mits  bactericidal  and  viricidal  possessions  [15,53]. 
The  results  (Table-4)  of  the  current  study  indicated 
that, after treatment with ozonated water for 30 min, 
3/13  (23.1%)  samples  were  negative  for  MRSA, 
while, after extension the exposure time for 45 min, 
the  number  of  negative  samples  were  increased  to 
reach 9/13 (69.2%). In addition, the results (Table-5) 
revealed  that,  after  treatment  with  ozonated  water 
for 30 min, MRSA levels had decreased by 1-2 log10 
CFU/ml, but this reduction increased with an exten-
sion the exposure time to 45 min to achieve 2-4 log10 
CFU/ml, and this reduction is highly significant from 
a public health perspective.

O3  is  a  powerful  wide-spectrum  antimicrobial 
agent that is energetic against bacteria, fungi, viruses, 
protozoa,  and  bacterial  and  fungal  spores  [15].  The 
inactivation of bacteria by O3 can be related to its high 
instability that leads to its rapid decomposition in free 
radicals, so its reactivity is credited to the oxidizing 
power of these free radicals and their ability to spread 
through the biological membranes, attacking cellular 
components, disturbs usual cellular activity responsi-
ble for microbial damage [16-20,53]. The results of this 
study indicated that the number of persisting bacterial 
cells represented by CFU from treated samples was 
lower than that of untreated samples. In addition, the 
number decreased with the increased exposure time to 
ozonated water at the same concentration (0.5 ppm), 
and  the  plausible  explanation  may  be  due  to  longer 
O3  contact  time  with  microorganisms  which  results 
in  a  reduction  in  the  inactivation  rate.  Furthermore, 
O3  treatments  were  performed  at  4°C.  In  general,  a 
reduction in the temperature of the aqueous medium 
rises the solubility and stability of O3, enhancing  its 
availability in the medium and consequently its effi-
cacy rises [53].

The  effectiveness  of  O3 

treatment  during 
immersion cooling as an intervention to improve the 
microbial safety of chicken carcasses had previously 
established by Jindal et al. [54] who found that O3 as 
0.44-0.54 ppm at 4°C for 45 min reduced the levels of 
aerobic plate count, Coliforms, and Escherichia coli on 
broiler sticks by 95.5%. Furthermore, they stated that 
the  microbial  reductions  after  treatment  for  15  min 
were  lower  than  those  acquired  after  treatment  for 
45 min, in which after O3 treatment for 15 min, the 
levels  of  Coliforms  and  E.  coli  were  reduced  by 
1.50 and 0.01 log10, respectively, whereas after treat-
ment for 45 min, the levels of Coliforms and E. coli 
were reduced to less than detection limit (0.00 log10 
CFU/ml). Hecer et al. [55] in their study compared the 
effects of two antimicrobial applications (O3 and chlo-
rine) as 1.5 ppm and 30 ppm for 7 min, respectively. 
They reported that the average effects of O3 and chlo-
rine  on  the  number  of  Staphylococcus/Micrococcus 
were 81.33% and 50%, respectively.

The results of this study are in accordance with 
the  previous  results  of  de  Boer  et  al.  [56]  in  which 
1450

Available at www.veterinaryworld.org/Vol.11/October-2018/14.pdfthey  described  gaseous  O3  as  a  successful  interven-
tion  to  destroy  MRSA  in  extensively  contaminated 
home environment when using O3 as an intervention 
to eliminate these bacteria from a carrier with eczema. 
Another study conducted by Burgassi et al. [57] esti-
mated  the  bactericidal  effect  of  O3  as  5-320  mg/L 
at  20°C  for  15  min  on  S.  aureus,  MRSA,  and 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and they found that no fea-
sible bacteria of S. aureus and MRSA were detected 
after O3 treatment. In addition, Song et al. [58] in their 
study assessed the effectiveness and safety of topical 
O3 on the treatment of skin infection with MRSA, and 
they reported that ozonated oil could disinfect up to 
98% of S. aureus and MRSA in 5 and 15 min, respec-
tively.  Furthermore,  they  concluded  that  ozonated 
water (1 mg/L) could sterilize 100% of S. aureus and 
MRSA in 1 min.
Conclusion

From  the  data  acquired  from  this  study,  it  can 
be concluded that fresh and frozen chicken meat that 
sold in the dissimilar marketplaces of Wasit Province 
was  extremely  contaminated  with  S.  aureus  during 
the  study  period  with  a  total  prevalence  of  54.2%; 
among  those,  33.3%  were  recognized  as  MRSA.  In 
addition, with respect to antibiotic resistance, the phe-
nomenon of MDR was recognized in all experienced 
isolates whereby these isolates exhibited 12 ARPs to 
four or more antimicrobial agents (MDR), and t hen 
take  into  consideration  that  the  contaminated  food 
is an important vehicle for the transfer of resistance 
to  antibiotics,  so  this  prevalent  of  MDR  is  a  public 
health concern when these life-saving antimicrobials 
are used to treat patients. Under the conditions des-
ignated in the existing study, O3 at the concentration 
of  0.5  ppm  is  highly  active  in  reducing  the  number 
of MRSA-positive samples and the number decreased 
with increased contact time to ozonated water at the 
same concentration. These results are very important 
from the public health point of view. Moreover, these 
results  have  recommended  that  ozonated  water  can 
be  used  as  a  likely  antibacterial  intervention  to  dis-
infect  broiler  meat  against  pathogenic  bacteria  such 
as MRSA, both during immersion cooling in poultry 
slaughterhouses or before domestic cooking (at home 
and in restaurants).
