Layer Farms in Northern Jordan Using Microbroth
Dilution and Disc Diffusion Techniques

Abstract: Campylobacter jejuni is an important pathogen of signiﬁcant public health importance. This pathogen is
associated with human infection and has been isolated from mammals and birds. Ninety-two cloacal C. jejuni isolates were
identiﬁed from 35 layer farms in Northern Jordan. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using minimal inhibitory
concentration (MIC) and disc diffusion techniques with variable suggested breakpoints. Using MIC and EUCAST cut-off
values, the study revealed a signiﬁcantly high resistance level (100%) among the layers’ isolates against ciproﬂoxacin and
tetracycline. A relatively high resistance (41%) toward gentamicin and amoxicillin and low resistance to nalidixic acid
(21%), erythromycin (14%), and ﬂorfenicol (6.5%) were also found. This high level of resistance may indicate abuses in
the handling of antibiotics, which may require stricter control in the local layer industry. A good agreement between
the 2 techniques used was demonstrated and the disc diffusion technique could be used as a rapid screening test for
antimicrobial susceptibility of C. jejuni to many antibiotics using speciﬁc Campylobacter breakpoints.

source of infection to handlers and consumers. The abuse of antibiotics in layer chicken farms may lead to resistance of
animal-origin human pathogens and potentially be reﬂected in human campylobacteriosis treatment. C. jejuni of chicken
origin is quite resistant to most commonly used antibiotics and the careful selection of correct antibiotic treatment is
necessary.

Introduction

Poultry ﬂocks are considered natural hosts of Campylobacter
spp. with worldwide prevalence ranging from 10% to 82%. Campy-
lobacter spp. are a leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in hu-
mans with about 400 million cases of campylobacteriosis being
reported annually worldwide by the European Food Safety Au-
thority (EFSA) (EFSA 2006). However, due to underreporting,
the true incidence is estimated to be 10 times higher than what is
documented (Gibreel and Taylor 2006). The majority of campy-
lobacteriosis cases are self-limiting; however, in prolonged cases or
bacteremia, the macrolides, ﬂuoroquinolones, or gentamicin are
the drugs of choice. Resistance of C. jejuni to tetracycline, ery-
thromycin, ciproﬂoxacin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, and chloram-
phenicol has been reported (Luangtongkum and others 2007). An-
tibiotics resistance in Campylobacter isolates from both humans and
animals against ciproﬂoxacin and ﬂuoroquinolones is continuously
increasing (de Jong and others 2009; Geenen and others 2011). In
the Netherlands, approximately 50% of the Campylobacter isolates
from humans were resistant to ciproﬂoxacin compared with 35%
in the period 2002 to 2005 (Geenen and others 2011). In Europe,
a steady increase in ﬂuoroquinolone resistance in Campylobacter
has been observed in many countries (de Jong and others 2009).

Results from EU Member States show that the antimicrobial resis-
tance of C. jejuni against ﬂuoroquinolones in poultry ranges from
16.7% in Denmark up to 100% in Hungary and Latvia (Geenen
and others 2011). In developing countries, the unrestricted use of
antimicrobials in both human and veterinary medicine has initiated
an ongoing debate regarding the use of these drugs in livestock.
There is a scarcity of data on C. jejuni resistance rates in developing
and Middle Eastern countries even though Campylobacter remains a
major cause of acute enteric diseases in these countries (Moore and
others 2006). Talhouk and others (1998) tested Campylobacter iso-
lates from diarrheic human stools, chicken caeca, and raw chicken
carcasses in Lebanon. Most of these isolates had high to moderate
susceptibility to gentamicin (97%), amoxicillin clavulanate (95%),
clindamycin (77%), chloramphenicol (77%), and ampicillin (69%).
However, some isolates showed lower susceptibility against tetra-
cycline (49%), erythromycin (47%), ciproﬂoxacin (39%), and nor-
ﬂoxacin (36%). In Jordan, C. jejuni was isolated from 0.9% of 1400
diarrheal Jordanian patients and 77% exhibited resistance toward
cotrimoxazole (Battikhi 2002).

In a local study on 38 broiler isolates, 21 isolates (55%) showed
multidrug resistance and the remaining isolates
(17%) were
totally sensitive to the tested drugs (erythromycin, gentamycin,
tilmicosin,
norﬂoxacin ciproﬂoxacin, doxycycline tetracycline,
amoxicillin, chlortetracycline, and trimethoprim). Of
the 21
multidrug-resistant isolates, 2 were resistant to only 2 antibiotics
(amoxicillin and trimethoprim), 3 were resistant to 9 antimi-
crobials, and the other 16 isolates were resistant to all tested
antimicrobials (Osaili and others 2012).

ing methods, including broth microdilution, agar dilution, disc

diffusion test, and the epsilometer test (E-test), have been re-
ported to measure antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter spp.
with contraversal results (Ge and others 2002; McDermott and
others 2005; Luangtongkum and others 2007; Miﬂin and others
2007; Lehtopolku and others 2012). The objectives of this work
are to present the ﬁrst results of an antimicrobial susceptibility
assay of local C. jejuni isolated from layer farms and compare re-
sistance patterns using both microbroth dilution and disc diffusion
techniques with variable suggested breakpoints.

Materials and Methods
Campylobacter jejuni isolates

The method described by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) 10272-1 (2006) was followed for the iso-
lation and identiﬁcation of C. jejuni. There are 35 separate layer
chicken farms of mainly the Lohmann breed operating in Irbid
Governorate (Northern Jordan), which comprise 43 houses. Cloa-
cal swabs were collected from layers in all 43 houses, where each
1000 birds were represented by 5 swabs from 5 randomly selected
birds. Samples were transported to our Food Research Laboratory
under sterile cool condition and kept refrigerated (8 °C) to be
examined within 6 to 8 h. Swabs were enriched using Bolton
broth (Oxoid, U.K.) followed by plating on selective mCCD agar
(Oxoid, U.K.). C. jejuni was conﬁrmed morphologically and bio-
chemically (catalase, oxidase, motility, microaerophilic growth at
25 °C, growth at 41.5 °C under aerobic conditions, DRYSPOT
agglutination, and Hippurate hydrolysis) as described by Donni-
sion (2003) and ISO (2006). Isolates were kept at −80 °C in
nutrient broth (Oxoid, U.K.) with 15% glycerol and subcultured
after thawing on Columbia Blood Agar (Oxoid, U.K.) as outlined
by Gorman and Adley (2004). Subcultured isolates were stored at
refrigerator temperature during processing and for no more than
3 d.

Ninety-two isolates were conﬁrmed molecularly as C. jejuni
using PCR techniques targeting the putative oxidoreductase sub-
(cid:3)
unit in the C. jejuni genome. The primers pair F (5

Antimicrobials susceptibility tests

The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 9 antimicro-
bials were tested by the broth dilution method as described by the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI 2008). Standard-
ized concentrations of antimicrobial agents were added to sterile
microarray wells and diluted in serial 2-fold dilutions across the
plates. Stock solutions of antimicrobials were prepared at a concen-
tration of 1280 μg/mL, or 40 times of the highest used concen-
tration (CLSI 2008). Fifty microliters of the working dilution of
each antimicrobial was serially diluted in 50 μL Mueller–Hinton
Broth (Oxoid, UK) to obtain a 2-fold dilution series starting at 0.5
and up to 24 μg/mL. Cultures were prepared in saline to turbidity
equal to McFarland 0.5 and then diluted onto Mueller–Hinton
broth with 5% deﬁbrinated horse blood (Oxoid, UK) to obtain
an inoculum of approximately 105 CFU/mL and 100 μL of in-
oculum was pipetted into each well. MICs were deﬁned as lowest
concentrations in wells with no visual growth. Susceptibility pro-
ﬁles were determined by comparing the calculated MIC values to
published breakpoints for each tested antimicrobial.

The EUCAST disc diffusion methodology for C. jejuni was also
followed to determine the susceptibility or resistance level. For
the disc diffusion method, the inoculum equivalent to McFarland
0.5 turbidity (Oxoid, U.K.) was transferred onto Mueller–Hinton
plates with 5% deﬁbrinated horse blood using cotton-tipped swabs
to produce a conﬂuent lawn of bacterial growth. Once the inocu-
lum was dried on the plates, antibiotic discs were distributed over
them. Then, the plates were incubated at 42 °C for 24 h under
microaerobic conditions. The zone diameter was measured with
slipping calipers. MIC and disc diffusion tests of each antimicro-
bial were performed 3 times for each antimicrobial and isolate.
For comparison, C. jejuni ATCC 33560 was used as the control
organism.

The antimicrobials examined represent those commonly used
in Jordan’s poultry industry: ampicillin, erythromycin-SCN, gen-
tamicin sulfate, ciproﬂoxacin, doxycycline HCl, tetracycline HCl,
amoxicillin 3H2O, ﬂorfenicol, and nalidixic acid. These antibi-
otic powders were obtained from Tocelo Chemicals (Holland)
through Arab Veterinary Industries Company (AVICO, Jordan),
and nalidixic acid from Oman Biochem and Pharmaceuticals LLC
(Oman) through Dar Al Dawa Company (Jordan).

All antibiotics discs were obtained from Arab Company for
Medical Diagnostics, Jordan (ARCOMEX), except for nalidixic
acid (Bioanalyse, Turkey).

Quality control and antimicrobial breakpoints

The quality control ranges of antibiotic resistance of the refer-
ence strain C. jejuni ATCC 33560 used in this study are presented
in Table 1. From EUCAST (2012, 2016), the proposed zone diam-
eters for deﬁning the disc diffusion breakpoints for Campylobacter
are only available for ciproﬂoxacin, erythromycin, tetracycline,
and doxycycline. For the other antimicrobials, breakpoint values
of the Antibiogram Committee of the French Society for Micro-
biology (Comite De L’antibiogramme De La Societe Francaise
De Microbiologie Recommendations 2012) were used (Table 2).
The EUCAST (2012, 2016) cut-off values for the microdilution
method used in this study are also presented in Table 2.

Statistical analysis

The correlation and level of agreement between the standard-
ized broth dilution method and the agar disc diffusion method
were calculated using percentage agreement and kappa statistic
(Viera and Garrett 2005) using IBM SPSS Statistics.

Results

Using the microdilution test, no signiﬁcant variations were
observed between the 3 replicates for each antibiotic or isolate.
Coefﬁcient of variation was 0.0% to 4.0%. For disc diffusion read-
ings for all compounds or strains there was a substantial variation

Based on results

(up to 7%) between the repetitions. The mean value of the coef-
ﬁcient of variation for each tested antimicrobial was close to 10%.
from broth microdilution technique and
EUCAST sensitivity cut-off values (ࣘ mg/L), all 92 isolates
(100%) were completely resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, and
ciproﬂoxacin, and 95% were resistant to doxycycline. In addi-
tion, 41% of the isolates were also resistant to amoxicillin and
gentamicin and 21% to nalidixic acid while 14% and 6.5% were
resistant to erythromycin and ﬂorfenicol, respectively (Table 3).
EUCAST-Disc diffusion cut-off values are given for the 4 antibi-
otics (tetracycline, doxycycline, ciproﬂoxacin, and erythromycin)
and their calculated resistance percentages for the studied isolates
were 100, 100, 100, and 66, respectively. Highly signiﬁcant statisti-
cal correlations were calculated for tetracycline and ciproﬂoxacin,
but not for erythromycin, between the 2 techniques (Table 3).

Results of disc diffusion, MICs techniques along with the
French breakpoints are presented in Table 4. Using the break-
point values of the disc diffusion method, 100% of the isolates
were resistant to ampicillin, ciproﬂoxacin, and nalidixic acid and
95% were resistant to tetracycline. However, only 16% were resis-
tant to doxycycline; 63% to erythromycin; 53% to amoxicillin; and
22% to gentamicin. Using the broth dilution technique, there was
100% resistance to ampicillin, ciproﬂoxacin, and tetracycline, with
70% resistance to erythromycin and 50% to amoxicillin suggesting
good agreement between the 2 techniques. However, higher resis-
tance values were found for doxycycline (41%), gentamicin (38%),
and nalidixic acid (63%) using MIC, with no signiﬁcant correla-
tion between the 2 techniques (Table 4). All isolates tested in the
current study are multidrug-resistant (resistant to ࣙ3 antibiotics).

Discussion

This study revealed a signiﬁcantly higher level of resistance of
local C. jejuni isolates to most antibiotics under study. These resis-
tance levels recorded for layer isolates are much higher than those
reported in a previous local study of broiler isolates (Osaili and
others 2012). This might be related to the longer life span of layers
and, thus, an increased probability of exposure to antimicrobials. It
also corroborates other observations, where signiﬁcant differences

broiler and layer Campylobacter isolates are reported (Bester and
Essack 2008).

Several countries have reported increasing resistance rates for
ﬂuoroquinolones, but not for macrolides or tetracycline (Gau-
dreau and Gilbert 2003). In France, however, the resistance of
human isolates to ﬂuoroquinolones has decreased in association
with similar trends noticed in poultry and pig isolates (Gallay and
others 2007). The rapid emergence of ﬂuoroquinolones-resistant
Campylobacter worldwide may be partially attributed to the en-
hanced ﬁtness of this pathogen and related to the broad use of ﬂu-
oroquinolones in veterinary medicine, especially in poultry. The
resistance patterns for ﬂuoroquinolones and tetracyclines reported
in this study are signiﬁcantly higher than antimicrobial resistance
reported in the European Union (EFSA 2006). Speciﬁcally, EFSA
recorded Campylobacter isolated from 20% to 64% of poultry, other
meats, and animals were resistant to ﬂuoroquinolones. Broad spec-
trum and inexpensive tetracyclines are extensively used in poultry,
livestock, and human medicines. Therefore, it is not surprising to
ﬁnd high resistance rates in Jordan (this study), the United King-
dom (Piddock and others 2008), the United States (Son and others
2007), Spain and Japan (Itoh and others 1984), and Australia (Pratt
and Korolik 2005). All isolates tested in this study exhibit resis-
tance to tetracyclines (doxycycline, tetracycline). High incidences
are generally recorded in the United States for conventionally and
organically grown chickens and in Canada, where more than 50%
of C. jejuni isolates from chickens were resistant to tetracycline
(Deckert and others 2010). In addition, the high resistance to en-
roﬂoxacin (100%) reported here does not correlate with the low
incidence of resistance (7%) reported in Sweden (Lindmark and
others 2004) or 29.5% in Japan (Haruna and others 2012).

Most C. jejuni usually produces β-lactamases; therefore, it is
traditionally not treated with β lactams. The 100% resistance to
ampicillin found in our study agrees with that found in clinical
and environmental isolates in developing countries (Baserisalehi
and others 2005; Khorsavi and others 2011). Lower resistance is
cited in developed locations, such as Australia, Germany, Canada,
and Ireland (46%, 9.1%, 22%, and 33%, respectively) (Oza and
others 2003; Gu´evremont and others 2006; Unicomb and others
2006; D¨ohne and others 2012). High resistance rates are generally
reported toward amoxicillin (Bester and Essack 2008) which is
close to the 40% to 50% resistance reported in this study.

Worldwide, resistance to aminoglycosides is generally very low
because gentamicin is rarely used in the poultry industry and,
hence, resistance to gentamicin has not been reported in many
countries (Wardak and others 2007; Deckert and others 2010;
Zhao and others 2010). However, gentamicin is used locally in
veterinary medicine practices and, therefore, this study reports a
20% to 40% resistance rate, which agrees with the 19% and 26%
reported in South Africa and India, respectively (Baserisalehi and
others 2005; Bester and Essack 2008).

Campylobacter resistance to macrolides is of public health im-
portance because erythromycin is the drug of choice for treat-
ing human campylobacteriosis. High resistance to erythromycin is
usually linked to high levels of tylosin used in the poultry industry
(Iovine and Blaser 2004), and this may explain the 14% to 70%
resistance level (depending on the method used) observed in our
isolates. High resistance percentages were also reported by Bester
and Essack (2008) and Baserisalehi and others (2005), although
recent reports from developed countries show complete suscep-
tibility toward erythromycin (Wardak and others 2007; Deckert
and others 2010; D¨ohne and others 2012).

agreement, 0.61 to 0.80 substantial agreement, 0.81 to 0.99 almost perfect agreement.

The lowest resistance pattern recorded in this study was toward
ﬂorfenicol (6.5%), which was calculated according to the EU-
CAST cut-off values. This trend parallels the very low resistance
percentages (0.0 to 2.6) reported for chloramphenicol (Deckert
and others 2010) and nonresistance to ﬂorfenicol (Zhao and oth-
ers 2010).

Multidrug resistance among C. jejuni isolates from both animal
and human sources is increasing. In addition to quinolones, isolates
are commonly resistant to macrolides, tetracycline, and ampicillin.
Results show that the CmeG gene functions as a multidrug efﬂux
transporter, thus contributing to antibiotic resistance and oxidative
defense in Campylobacter spp. (Jeon and others 2011). The general
percentage of multidrug-resistant isolates has been reported as up
to 15% to 43% (H¨anninen and Hannula 2007; Bester and Essack
2008). Not surprisingly, all our tested isolates exhibited multidrug
resistance, which indicates the widespread misuse of antibiotics
in the local layer industry. Antimicrobials used in laying birds
are usually deposited in the eggs (Goetting and others 2011).
Therefore, the unwise use of antimicrobials in layer hens will
affect public health through egg consumption or consumption of
the birds at the end of laying cycle.

Using EUCAST breakpoints, this study demonstrates a per-
fect statistical agreement (kappa) between the 2 techniques (MIC
compared with disc diffusion) for ciproﬂoxacin and tetracycline,
but not for erythromycin. However, using French breakpoints,
there was a highly statistical agreement between disc diffusion
and broth dilution techniques for ampicillin, amoxicillin, ery-
thromycin, ciproﬂoxacin, and tetracycline. Similarly, there was
substantial agreement for gentamicin and nalidixic acid and mod-
erate agreement for doxycycline as statistically calculated (kappa

values). Similarly Luangtongkum and others (2007) reported a
high level of agreement and correlation between the 2 meth-
ods for gentamicin, ciproﬂoxacin, norﬂoxacin, and nalidixic acid,
but not for erythromycin. These apparent disagreements in de-
termining the resistance values vary according to the investigated
antimicrobial agent(s) and the cut-off values used (Ge and others
2002; Moore and others 2006).

The use of different techniques (MIC, disc diffusion, E-test, agar
or broth dilutions) makes it difﬁcult to compare otherwise sim-
ilar studies on Campylobacter antimicrobial susceptibility. The use
of different breakpoints is also confounding when comparing an-
timicrobial resistance. It is suggested by several authors (Moore and
others 2006; Van der Beek and others 2010) that the MIC tech-
nique is the preferable method to test Campylobacter susceptibility.
However, disc diffusion has also been suggested by reference lab-
oratories, international organizations, and other researchers (EU-
CAST, CA-SFM, CLSI, BSAC, Ge and others 2002). The results
of this study show perfect agreement between disc diffusion and
broth microdilution methods for 6 out of the 9 studied antibiotics
(Table 4), which agrees with other ﬁndings (Luangtongkum and
others 2007; Miﬂin and others 2007). However, Lehtopolku and
others (2012) considered disc diffusion a nonreliable tool for test-
ing Campylobacter spp. Therefore, this study supports suggestions
that qualiﬁed multilaboratory disc diffusion studies are being em-
phasized for the creation of international standardized breakpoints.

Conclusions

It appears that antibacterial resistance is a serious and challeng-
ing issue. Use of antibacterial should be limited to situations where
the drugs are necessary for ensuring animal health and welfare and

done under veterinary guidance through efﬁcient global and local
monitoring systems. Variation in resistance detected by different
geographical regions in the world necessitates continuous public
health monitoring of Campylobacter spp. antimicrobial suscepti-
bilities. The high levels of antimicrobial resistance found among
Campylobacter isolates in this study require shared responsibility
between farmers, veterinarians, and authorities in Jordan for the
judicious use of antibiotics in poultry farms. The disc diffusion
method is ﬂexible, convenient, and not labor-intensive compared
with the MIC technique. The breakpoints used for disc diffusion
may not provide a very reproducible method for susceptibility test-
ing of C. jejuni. This is a major concern due to the common use
of this method in routine microbiology laboratories and in some
research studies. Disc diffusion may be used as a rapid screen-
ing test and further studies must assess whether this method and
corresponding breakpoints could be improved.
