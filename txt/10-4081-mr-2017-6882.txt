Abstract

The  availability  and  popularity  of
processed,  ready-to-cook  (RTC)  poultry
products  are  increasing  in  India.  Though
fresh poultry is known to be contaminated
with  Salmonella,  the  prevalence  of  this
foodborne  pathogen  in  RTC  poultry  prod-
ucts  is  not  reported.  Eighty-seven  chilled
and frozen RTC poultry samples of 4 differ-
ent brands obtained from supermarkets and
departmental  stores  in  Mumbai  were  ana-
lyzed  for  the  presence  of  Salmonella. The
prevalence of Salmonella was higher (51%)
in chilled RTC samples as compared to the
frozen RTC samples (5%). The frozen RTC
samples  of  one  brand  were  free  from
Salmonella.  S.  Typhimurium  (75.2%)  was
the most prevalent serovar, followed by S.
Enteritidis  (23%)  and  S.  Weltevreden
(1.7%). A  high  percentage  (81.4%)  of  the
isolates  were  found  to  be  resistant  to  5  or
more antibiotics and class 1 integron, which
has been shown to confer multi-drug resist-
ance, was detected in 69.9% of the isolates.
Multiple antibiotic resistance index of iso-
lates  was  high  (0.6)  indicating  the  indis-
criminate  use  of  antibiotics  during  poultry
farming.  High  genetic  diversity  was
observed  among  the  Salmonella serovars
based on Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis
profiles.  Results  showed  the  presence  of
multi-drug resistant Salmonella serovars in
processed,  chilled  RTC  poultry  products
marketed in Mumbai, India. 

Introduction

Salmonella is one of the most important
foodborne  pathogens.  Poultry  meat,  eggs
and  foods  of  animal  origin  are  important
sources of human Salmonella infections.1,2
The  ubiquitous  distribution  of  Salmonella
in the natural environment,3 and its preva-
lence in many foods have made inspection a

requirement  world-wide.4-6
mandatory 
Salmonella is  often  transmitted  to  humans
through  the  food  chain,  with  over  95%  of
salmonellosis cases attributable to the con-
sumption  of  undercooked  or  mishandled
pork, poultry and eggs.6-8 A multistate out-
break  of  Salmonella Heidelberg  infections
linked  to  foster  farm  brand  chicken  has
been reported.9

ent  brands  were  obtained  from  various
supermarkets  and  departmental  stores  in
Mumbai  (Supplementary  Table  S1).  The
chilled RTC samples included mixed bone-
less  chicken,  leg  cut,  precut,  soup  pieces,
kheema,  assorted  cut  pieces,  lollipops  or
drumsticks. The frozen RTC samples were
comprised  of  sausages,  kheema,  cutlet,
nuggets, tandoori chicken nuggets, tandoori
chicken  tikka,  chicken  samosa,  salami
slices, sheekh kebab, burger patty, lollipops,
and  spring  roll.  The  frozen  RTC  samples
contained ingredients such as flour, onion,
water,  spices  and  condiments  (coriander
leaves,  garlic,  ginger,  red  chili  powder,
coriander  powder,  curry  powder,  turmeric
powder,  green  chili,  kasoori  methi,  edible
vegetable oils, soya bean granules, iodized
salt,  and  acidity  regulators-INS  330,  452).
The samples were brought in ice and ana-
lyzed immediately. 

Emergence  of  multi  drug  resistant
Salmonella has  been  reported  worldwide
and it is a major public health concern.6,10-
12 The antimicrobial resistance is frequently
associated with integrons, transposons, and
plasmids, which are involved in horizontal
transfer  of  antibiotic  resistance  genes
among bacteria and increase in the overall
resistance  gene  pool.11,13,14 Integrons  are
genetic  elements  able  to  capture,  integrate
and rearrange open reading frames (ORFs)
embedded in variable regions of genes cas-
sette  units  and  convert  them  to  functional
genes  by  ensuring  their  correct  expres-
sion.15 Integrons do not transfer themselves;
instead  facilitate  transmission  of  antibiotic
resistance  genes  via  transposons  or  con-
jugative  plasmids.16 Class  1  integron,  the
most  common 
located  on
Salmonella  genomic  island  1  (SGI  1),  has
been  detected  in  different  Salmonella
serovars  such  as  S. Typhimurium,  S.
Bareily, S. Oslo, and S. Newport in several
countries.4,10,13 There are reports on multi-
drug  resistant  Salmonella isolated  from
India.4,13,17 However, 
of
Salmonella in RTC food samples in India is
not  well  documented.  Moreover  there  are
very few studies on molecular characteriza-
tion of these Salmonella isolates.4,18

Fresh poultry slaughtered in local shops
is  generally  preferred  by  consumers  in
India. However, due to changes in life style
and modernization, fresh chilled and frozen
RTC  poultry  products  has  become  readily
available in retail high end shops and super-
markets in major cities. But, there are few
studies  on  the  presence  of  Salmonella in
these RTC products from India.18 The aim
of  present  study  was  to  i)  screen  branded
RTC poultry products from Mumbai for the
presence of Salmonella, ii) study the antimi-
crobial resistance profile of Salmonella iso-
lates  and  presence  of  class  1  integron  in
MDR strains and iii) characterize these iso-
lates  by  Pulsed  Field  Gel  Electrophoresis
(PFGE).

Isolation of Salmonella

The isolation of Salmonella was carried
out as per US-FDA Bacteriological analyti-
cal  manual  8th edition.19 Microbiological
media  and  antibiotic  disc  were  from
HiMedia  Laboratories,  Mumbai,  India.
Twenty  five  grams  of  poultry  meat  were
homogenized in 225 mL lactose broth and
incubated at 37°C for 24 h. After the initial
pre-enrichment step, the samples were fur-
ther  enriched  in  Tetrathionate  broth  and
Rappaport-Vassiliadis medium at 43°C for
24 h. A loopful culture from each of these
media  was  streaked  on  Bismuth  Sulfite
Agar  (BSA),  Xylose  lysine  Deoxycholate
Agar  (XLDA),  and  Hektoen  Enteric Agar
(HEA)  and  plates  were  incubated  at  35°C
for 24 h. After pre-enrichment, enrichment
and plating on selective agar plates, typical
Salmonella were isolated, and identified by
biochemical tests like glucose test by Triple
sugar iron agar (TSI), lysine decarboxylase
test by Lysine Iron Agar (LIA), Urease test
(Urea  broth),  IMViC  test.19 Isolates  were
serotyped  at  the  National  Salmonella and
Escherichia Centre,  Central  Research
Institute, Kasauli, India. 

Antimicrobial susceptibility test

Salmonella isolates  were  screened  for
antibiotic  sensitivity  using  15  different
antibiotics  by  agar  diffusion  method  as
described  by  Clinical  and  Laboratory
Standards  Institute  (CLSI).20 Salmonella
isolates  were  grown  in  Mueller-Hinton
broth  (HiMedia)  overnight  to  prepare
inoculum  in  order  to  achieve  colony  sus-
pension to match with McFarland standard
0.5.  The  culture  suspensions  were  evenly
spread on Mueller-Hinton Agar (HiMedia)
and antibiotic discs were placed on agar sur-
face followed by further incubation at 37°C
for 24 h. Antibiotic resistance profiles were
assigned according to CLSI as resistant (R),
intermediate (I), or sensitive (S) after meas-
uring average zone diameter.5 The type and
concentration of antibiotics in disc were as
(AMP)  10  µg;
follows,  Ampicillin 
Chloramphenicol 
µg;
Streptomycin  (STR)  25  µg;  Cephalothin
(CEP) 30 µg; Nalidixic acid (NAL) 30 µg;
Ciprofloxacin  (CIP)  10  µg;  Ceftriaxone
(CTR)  30  µg;  Sulfamethizole  (SMZ)  300
µg;  Enrofloxacin 
10  µg;
Chlortetracycline (CTC) 30 µg; Kanamycin
(KAN)  30  µg;  Oxytetracycline  (OTC)  30
µg;  Ofloxacin  (OFX)  2  µg;  Trimethoprim
(TMP) 30 µg; and Tetracycline (TET) 30 µg
(HiMedia).  Multiple  antibiotic  resistance
(MAR)  index  is  calculated  as  the  ratio  of
number  of  resistant  antibiotics  to  which
organism  is  resistant  to  total  number  of
antibiotics to which organism is exposed.6

Molecular characterization of
Salmonella

Salmonella isolates were tested for the
presence  of invA  gene  by  PCR  amplifica-
tion  using  the  primers  as  previously
described  by  Chiu  et  al.21 The  Integron
region was PCR amplified from MDR iso-
lates using class 1 integron specific primers
(CSL1 and CSR1) as previously described
by Khan et al.13

PFGE  was  performed  as  per  the  Pulse
Net  USA  protocol  with  50  U  of  XbaI
(Bangalore  Genei,  Bangalore,  India)  at
37°C.22 PFGE  was  carried  out  with  Gene
Navigator System (Amersham Biosciences,
Sweden) in 1% agarose gel [Seakem® Gold
Agar  (Lonza,  Rockland,  USA)]  in  0.5  X
Tris-Borate  EDTA  buffer  at  9°C.  Pulse
times ramped from 5 to 120 s during a 25 h
run at 160 V. Lambda ladder PFGE marker
(New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MS, USA)
was used as molecular weight standard. The
gels  were  stained  with  ethidium  bromide.
The bands were analyzed visually and the 0
and 1 matrix (binary matrix) was developed
based on the presence or absence of partic-
ular size band on the gel in all the samples.
The matrix was analyzed using FREETREE
software (Version 0.9.1.50, Folia Biologica,
2001).  Strains  differing  by  one  band  were
considered as different pulsed field profiles
(PFPs). The relatedness of the isolates was
analyzed  using  Nei  and  Li/Dice  distance
similarity calculations and neighbor joining
as  the  tree  building  algorithm.  The  output
tree  was  visualized  using  the  Tree  View
software  (Version  1.5.2,  Roderic  D.  M.
2005). 

Results and Discussion 
Prevalence of Salmonella

High percentage of chilled RTC poultry
samples (53% of brand 1 and 50% of brand

2)  were  positive  for Salmonella as  com-
pared to frozen RTC samples (5% samples
of brand 4). The samples from brand 3 were
free  from  Salmonella (Table  1).  Present
investigation  shows  both  fresh  chilled  and
processed frozen RTC poultry products are
contaminated  with  Salmonella.  Poultry
meat  and  egg  are  established  as  a  major
source of contamination by Salmonella.6,22
Presence of Salmonella in fresh poultry has
been  well  reported  worldwide.6,8 In  the
present  study,  samples  were  taken  from
very  diverse  products.  The  comparison
between  these  products  with  respect  to
Salmonella incidence  is  difficult,  but  irre-
spective of the products, high incidence of
Salmonella was  found  in  all  the  samples
except  one.  It  was  found  that  minimally
processed,  fresh  RTC  poultry  samples
(mixed boneless, soup pieces, mixed bone-
less, precut, drumstick and leg cut ) and also
processed  fresh/frozen  RTC  poultry  sam-
ples  (from  brand  1  lollipops  and  kheema)
were  contaminated  with  S.  Typhimurium
and  S.  Enteritidis.  The  fresh  RTC  poultry
(brand  1  and  2)  comprised  of  both
processed  and  un-processed  poultry  prod-
ucts. Therefore, there is a high level of the
Salmonella incidence  in  these  products
(Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). Out
of 113 Salmonella isolates, 75.2% were S.
Typhimurium, 23% were S. Enteritidis and
1.7% were S. Weltevreden (Table 1). Thirty
four percent of Salmonella positive samples
were contaminated with at least 2 serovars
(Table  1  and  Supplementary  Table S1).  S.
Typhimurium  and  S. Enteritidis  were  the
most frequently reported serovars associat-
ed  with  human  foodborne  illnesses  and
poultry  industry  in  India.6,8 Also,  S.
Typhimurium is one of the most commonly
detected  serovars  from  animals  used  for
food and retail meat in the USA.10

were  multi-drug  resistant  (MDR)  with
resistance to 5 or more different antibiotics.
S. Typhimurium (17 isolates), S. Enteritidis
(11 isolates) and S. Weltevreden (2 isolates)
with MAR index from 0.5333 to 0.6 were
resistant to more than 8 antibiotics belong-
ing  to  different  class  of  antibiotics  (Table
2). Multidrug resistance has been reported
in a number of serovars of Salmonella from
different  foods.13,17 Salmonella isolates
from brand 1 and brand 2 were resistant to
9 different antibiotics; whereas, Salmonella
isolates of brand 4 were resistant to 4 antibi-
otics  (Table  2).  Ninety  percent  of  S.
Typhimurium  isolates  were  resistant  to
NAL,  CTC,  KAN,  OTC  and  TET.  All  S.
Enteritidis  isolates  were  resistant  to  KAN
and OTC, while more than 80% of isolates
were resistant to NAL and CTC. Both the S.
Weltevreden isolates were resistant to AMP,
NAL,  SMZ,  CTC,  KAN,  OTC,  and  TMP
(Table S2). The sensitivity pattern indicated
that  all  isolates  were  sensitive  to  CHL,
STR,  CIP,  CTR,  EFX,  and  OFX
(Supplementary Table S2). 

A  total  of  19  antibiotic  resistance  pat-

terns were observed. The most predominant
antibiotic  pattern  was  NAL,  SMZ,  CTC,
KAN,  OTC,  TMP,  TET  (29  isolates)  fol-
lowed  by  AMP,  CEP,  NAL,  SMZ,  CTC,
KAN, OTC, TMP, TET (16 isolates) (Table
2).  Multiple  antibiotic  resistance  (MAR)
index  of  both  S. Typhimurium  and  S.
Enteritidis  was  0.6  while  that  of  S.
Weltevreden was 0.53 (Table 2). The high
MAR index indicates indiscriminate use of
antibiotics  in  poultry  farming  for  growth
promotion, prophylaxis as well as therapeu-
tic purposes. The injudicious use of antibi-
otics  in  poultry  which  has  increased  the
emergence and maintenance of MAR bacte-
ria in the environment has been reported.1,6 

Molecular characterization

All  the  Salmonella serovars  isolated
from poultry were invA positive. The invA
gene is located on Salmonella Pathogenicity
Island 1 (SPI-1), which is essential for the
invasion  of  host’s  epithelial  cells  by
Salmonella. This gene is highly conserved
in Salmonella serotypes and has been used
as  a  potential  target  for  Salmonella detec-

tion.23 In a study of 630 different strains of
Salmonella enterica, 99.4% of strains were
found to harbour the invA gene.24 Whereas
another study reported the presence of invA
gene in Salmonella is not universal, as dur-
ing  their  study  out  of  35  tested  strains  of
Salmonella,  33  harboured  sseL  as  well  as
invA virulence genes, however two strains
(Salmonella Molade  and  Salmonella
München),  did  not  harbour  the  invA  viru-
lence gene.25

Seventy percent of the Salmonella iso-
lates  carried  the  class  1  integron.  Class  1
integron  specific  PCR  detected  double
amplicons (1 kb and 1.2 kb) in 53.9% iso-
lates  (Supplementary  Figure  S1).  The  rest
of  the  class  1  integron  positive  isolates
showed multiple bands. These results were
consistent  with  earlier  studies.11,26-28
Integrons  may  carry  antibiotic  resistance
gene  cassettes,  which  confer  resistance  to
antimicrobials.13 In the present study, 82%
of the integron positive isolates were MDR.
But interestingly, 18% of the integron posi-
tive  isolates  were  non-MDR  (resistant  to
less  than  5  antibiotics).  Ampicillin  and

tetracycline resistance of these isolates may
be due to presence of genes responsible for
antibiotic  resistance  on  class  1  integron.29
However, resistance to NAL could be due to
mutation in the target genes of proteins of
these antibiotics.14 Resistance to KAN, and
OTC  could  be  attributed  to  inhibition  of
protein  synthesis.26 It  was  found  that  26
MDR strains of Salmonella lacked the class
1  integron. This  could  be  due  to  the  pres-
ence  of  antibiotic  resistance  genes  else-
where on the chromosome as reported earli-
er.11,26

Vast  genetic  diversity  was  observed
the  S.  Typhimurium  and  S.
among 
S.
Enteritidis 
Typhimurium  isolates  were  clustered  into
twenty 
patterns
(Supplementary Figure S2). The major clus-
ter of S. Typhimurium comprised of 13 iso-
lates  from  brand  2  and  4  samples
(Supplementary  Figure  S2).  Twenty  six  S.
Enteritidis  isolates  were  grouped  into  5
PFGE  patterns.  Fifteen  S.  Enteritidis  iso-
lates  from  brand  1,  2  and  4  samples  were
clustered 
patterns
(Supplementary Figure S3). The PFGE pat-
terns clearly indicated that Salmonella spp.
isolated  from  the  poultry  samples  were  of
same clonal origin. For example, the PFGE
pattern  of  S.  Typhimurium  isolate  no  445
from  brand  4  was  same  as  that  of  S.
Typhimurium isolate no 501 from brand 2.
Also,  PFGE  patterns  of  S.  Enteritidis  iso-
lates no 32,123 and 458 were same; howev-
er, these serotypes were isolated from brand
1, 2 and 4, respectively. Previous study on
genetic  diversity  of  Salmonella showed
in  Salmonella isolates
high  diversity 
obtained from different food samples.30
However, there is no PFGE data bank like
PulseNet  (http://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/)
program in India. Therefore, it is very diffi-
cult  to  trace  Salmonella isolated  from  dif-
ferent regions and tag them to the source of
origin.  Moreover,  serovars  isolated  at  dif-
ferent time periods of the year also showed
same  PFGE  pattern,  for  example,  S.
Enteritidis isolate no 32 and 242 were from
same brand but they were isolated in differ-
ent months. These results indicate that same
Salmonella serovars  are  present  in  poultry
products  from  different  brands.  Similarity
in PFGE patterns could be due to cross-con-
tamination that most likely happened during
processing  and  handling,  which  would
account for the isolation of same organism
at different stages of processing from differ-
ent meat carcasses.31 One of the sources of
contamination could be the feed used in the
poultry farms.32,33

Conclusions

Present  study  demonstrates  the  high
incidence of Salmonella in poultry samples.
We  also  observed  high  percentage  of
Salmonella isolates  resistant  to  multiple
antibiotics. Our study also reveals that, the
modern  food  processing  methods  adopted
by poultry industry are insufficient to pro-
duce  microbiologically  safe  poultry  prod-
ucts. We observed that minimally processed
fresh  chilled  RTC  poultry  products  and
processed, frozen RTC poultry samples are
contaminated  with  S.  Typhimurium,  S.
Enteritidis  and  S. Weltevreden  serovars.  It
may be due to poor processing practices fol-
lowed  by  the  poultry  industry.  Recently
more stringent food laws are being imple-
mented to improve the processed food qual-
ity in India.
