Different samples were collected from three swine farms in China to investigate the spread of antibiotic-resistant
Escherichia coli. A total of 130 E. coli isolates were obtained from feces, air, river water, silt, and soil samples and
characterized. The susceptibility of the E. coli isolates to 19 antibiotics was tested. The results revealed that the
resistance rates of the E. coli isolates against 9 antibiotics were high. The minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC) values of ciproﬂoxacin, oﬂoxacin, and nalidixic acid were mainly in the ranges of 2–64, 8–64, and 8–64
μg/ml. The plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes qnr, aac(6′)-Ib-cr, qepA, and oqxAB were de-
tected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the similarity of E. coli from different samples was identiﬁed
by pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The detection rates of the qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, aac(6′)-Ib-cr, qepA, and
oqxAB genes in the E. coli isolates from three swine farms were in the range of 10.87–23.08%, 13.04–20.51%,
40.00–43.48%, 30.43–38.46%, 6.52–12.82%, and 7.69–17.39%, respectively. The PFGE result showed that 49%
(49/100) of isolates originating from air, river water, soil, and silt samples had ≥85% similarity to fecal-
obtained isolates, and 40.82% (20/49) of them shared the same PMQR genes with fecal-obtained isolates. This in-
dicated that E. coli carrying PMQR genes and originating from feces in swine farms could spread to the external
environment, which could be a potential threat to the public environment and human health.

1. Introduction

B. Wu et al. / Science of the Total Environment 665 (2019) 33–40

Escherichia coli is a Gram-negative bacterium commonly found in
the intestines of humans and animals (Schroeder et al., 2004;
Schierack et al., 2006), and it is also the main etiologic agent of farm an-
imal diarrhea and acute urinary tract infections (Makrina et al., 2012;
Manges, 2016). It is an opportunistic pathogen that is widely present
in animal farms and their surrounding environments (Duan et al.,
2006; Gao et al., 2015). Quinolones are broad-spectrum antibiotics
that have become the most widely used in clinical practice after several
generations of development. It play an extremely important role in the
treatment of bacterial infections such as E. coli (Michael and Jason,
2014) and are often used to treat and prevent diseases in pig farms in
China (Tian et al., 2009, 2012; Yuan et al., 2009). With the use and
even abuse of quinolones, especially in some developing countries, re-
sistance to these drugs is becoming more common and spreading
(Hart and Kariuki, 1998). The resistance rate against quinolones of clin-
ical isolates of E. coli from human hospitals has gradually increased up to
70% in China in recent years (Zhu et al., 2011; Xiao et al., 2011).

There are four main mechanisms of E. coli resistance to
ﬂuoroquinolones: 1) mutations of the genes encoding the target enzyme
DNA gyrase (encoded by gyrA and gyrB genes) and topoisomerase IV
(encoded by parC and parE), 2) efﬂux of quinolones by hyperexpression
of chromosomal pumps or acquisition of plasmidic pumps (e.g., qepA,
oqxAB), 3) the decrease in membrane permeability, and 4) enzymatic in-
activation by AAC-(6′)-Ib-cr (Mirzaii et al., 2018; Recacha et al., 2017).
Quinolone resistance was originally thought to be mediated by chromo-
somal gene mutations, which block DNA replication by inhibiting DNA
rotatase and topoisomerase IV. However, the plasmid-mediated quino-
lone resistance gene (PMQR) qnr was ﬁrst identiﬁed in a clinical isolate
of Klebsiella pneumonia in 1998 (Martinez-Martinez et al., 1998),
followed by a second mechanism for PMQR in 2006: the modiﬁcation
of certain quinolones by a particular aminoglycoside acetyltransferase,
aac(6′)-Ib-cr (Robicsek et al., 2006). A third mechanism for PMQR was
added in 2007 with the discovery of plasmid-mediated quinolone efﬂux
pumps QepA (Yamane et al., 2007; Périchon et al., 2007) and OqxAB
(Hansen et al., 2007). Horizontal gene transfer of these PMQR determi-
nants between bacteria have contributed to the decrease in susceptibil-
ity to ﬂuoroquinolones (Gay et al., 2006; Cattoir et al., 2008; Zhou et al.,
2011; Li et al., 2012), which has attracted wide attention. Studies have
shown that E. coli isolated from different environments carries both
ESBL and PMQR genes (Wang et al., 2012), and they usually coexist on
the same plasmid. Plasmids carrying multiple resistance genes can
transfer the multiple resistance among different strains, which poses a
great threat to the treatment of human and animal diseases (Jiang
et al., 2012).

Food-producing animals are considered a reservoir of resistant bac-
teria (Carattoli, 2008; Ma et al., 2009). Bacteria including the pathogenic
ones carried by food-producing animals could spread to surrounding
environments through different routes, such as air, water and waste
(McEachran et al., 2015; Sanchez et al., 2016), which might result in in-
fections in animals and farm workers (Fiegel et al., 2006; Létourneau
et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2016). The direct efﬂuence of waste to the environ-
ment and the application in agriculture have contributed to the dissem-
ination of resistant bacteria (Buchberger, 2007; Chee et al., 2009; Liu
et al., 2012). Large amounts of (ﬂuoro)quinolone-resistant E. coli are
contained in animal houses, especially E. coli carrying PMQR genes
(Chen et al., 2012; Jiang et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012). The PMQR
mechanism is widely distributed in bacterial plasmids in various envi-
ronments around the world (Strahilevitz et al., 2009). In the small ani-
mal hospitals in Shaanxi province, China, 80% of isolates harbored at
least one PMQR gene, and 40% of isolates harbored more than one
PMQR gene (qnrB, qnrD, qnrS, qepA, or aac(6′)-Ib-cr). At present, re-
search on the mechanisms of ﬂuoroquinolone resistance in E. coli is
mainly focused on clinical isolates and pathogenic E. coli (Mirzaii et al.,
2018; Piekarska et al., 2015). More research has been done on the

resistance mechanisms of the gyrA and parC mutations, but less atten-
tion has been given to E. coli carrying PMQR genes isolated from farms
(Piekarska et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2015). There are fewer studies on
the transmission of these resistant bacteria from swine farms to the sur-
rounding environment (Chen et al., 2012; Gao et al., 2015). Thus, in this
study, E. coli was isolated from fecal and environmental samples from
three swine farms to test the antibiotic susceptibility. The similarity of
the PMQR genes was examined to investigate the spread of quinolone-
resistant E. coli from breeding environments to the surrounding envi-
ronments, which has far-reaching effects in veterinary public health
and epidemiological signiﬁcance.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Swine farms

Between February and July 2014, fecal and environment samples
were collected from three swine farms located in Tai'an, Shandong
Province, China. The swine farms are located on the east side of the vil-
lages. The distances between the swine farms and the nearest village
ranged from 500 to 800 m. All farms investigated were equipped with
exhaust fans and were all naturally ventilated through the doors and
windows according to the indoor temperature. The feces were removed
daily and then accumulated for land application. The swine houses were
disinfected once or twice per week with peracetic acid and sodium hy-
pochlorite. The animal densities were 0.9–2.9 animals per square meter.
Subtherapeutic doses of broad-spectrum antibiotics such as tylosin,
penicillin, streptomycin, and tetracycline were used for prophylaxis
and growth promotion.

2.2. Sampling of airborne E. coli

E. coli was collected from the air inside the swine houses using a six-
stage Andersen sampler (Andersen, 1958). Samplers with MacConkey
agar plates (Oxoid, CM0115) were placed in the middle of the houses
approximately 80 cm above the ground, and the indoor air was col-
lected at an airﬂow rate of 28.3 L/min for 1 to 5 min. Airborne E. coli
from the outdoor air was also collected using a Reuter centrifugal sam-
pler (RCS) at 1.5 m above the ground level with an airﬂow rate of
40 L/min for 0.5–8 min at two upwind sites (10 and 50 m away) and
seven downwind sites (5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 400 m away). Sam-
ples were collected from each site in triplicate.

The collected samples were cultured at 37 °C for 24–48 h, and then
the Gram status of the colonies was determined. Gram-negative colo-
nies were subcultured in eosin methylene blue (EMB) agar (Tian He,
Hangzhou, China) and identiﬁed by an API 20 E system (Bio Merieux,
Marcy-I'Etoile, France). All isolates were stored at −20 °C in 50%
glycerin.

2.3. Fecal, silt, river water, and soil sampling

Fifty fresh fecal samples were collected randomly from each swine
farm, and 50 silt, river, and soil samples were collected at each different
site (5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 400 m away from the outfall of the
farms). All samples were collected aseptically, stored at 4 °C, and ana-
lyzed within 24 h. Fecal, silt, river, and soil samples were diluted 10-
fold with 0.9% NaCl solution. Vacuum ﬁltration (TOM-JET1 water jet

air pump) was also used to concentrate the microbial populations
(Reinthaler et al., 2003). The diluted samples were spread onto an
EMB agar plate. After incubation at 37 °C for 18 to 20 h, colonies with
a characteristic metallic sheen were selected and streaked on a
MacConkey agar plate. The plate was incubated overnight at 37 °C,
after which pink colonies were selected, and the isolates were assessed
accordingly.

2.4. Antibiotic susceptibility test and determination of minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) by microdilution broth method

Antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out by a disk diffusion
method on a Mueller-Hinton agar plate with E. coli ATCC 25922 as a ref-
erence strain. The susceptibility of the following antibiotics was tested
according to the manufacturer's instructions: ampicillin 10 μg (AMP),
piperacillin 100 μg (PIP), amoxicillin 20 μg/clavulanic acid 10 μg
(AMC), ampicillin 10 μg/sulbactam 10 μg (A/S), piperacillin 100 μg/
sulbactam 10 μg (P/T), cephalothin 30 μg (CEP), cefuroxime 30 μg
(CXM), aztreonam 30 μg (ATM), gentamicin 10 μg (GEN), kanamycin
30 μg (KAN), streptomycin 10 μg (STM), amikacin 30 μg (AMK),

tetracycline 30 μg (TET), ciproﬂoxacin 5 μg (CIP), oﬂoxacin 5 μg (OFX),
nalidixic acid 30 μg (NAL), sulfamethoxazole 25 μg (SXT), chloramphen-
icol 30 μg (CAP), and nitrofurantoin 300 μg (NIT) (Tan Hou Ocean Devel-
opment Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China).

Ciproﬂoxacin, oﬂoxacin, and nalidixic acid were diluted to different
concentrations, and then the MIC values of tested bacteria and reference
strain (ATCC25922) were detected. The test method, judgment stan-
dard, and quality control test were carried out by the American Clinical
Laboratory Standardization Committee (NCCLS, 2004).

2.5. Identiﬁcation of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes

The DNA templates of the E. coli isolates were prepared with a boil-
ing method. PCR was used to detect the antibiotic-resistance genes
qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, qnrS1, qnrS2, aac (6′)-Ib, aac (6′)-Ib-cr, qepA, and
oqxAB. The primer sequences and annealing temperatures are listed in
Table 2. The ampliﬁcation reactions were performed as previously de-
scribed (Cheng et al., 2006). Each sample was tested three times, and
isolates that were conﬁrmed by sequence and blast analysis were used
as quality controls.

2.7. Pulsed ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE)

To determine the genetic relatedness of the E. coli isolates, their ge-
nomic DNA were digested with the restriction enzyme XbaI and then
subjected to PFGE analysis according to the PulseNet Standardized Lab-
oratory Protocol (PulseNet., 2002) using the CHEF Mapper™ System
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and previous literature (Tenover
et al., 1995). The Salmonella (H9812) serotype Braenderup strain re-
stricted with XbaI was used as a molecular weight standard. Cluster
analysis of the pulsotypes was carried out using the Dice coefﬁcient
method in UPGMA (optimization: 1.5%; band position tolerance: 1.5%)
in BioNumerics (Version7.6, Applied Maths, Inc.).

2.6. Qnr gene sequence determination and analysis

The 58 qnrS PCR positive product and 21 qnrB PCR positive product
were puriﬁed and ligated into the PMD18-T cloning vector and then

transferred into DH5ɑ competent cells. The positive strain that had

been successfully cloned with the qnrS target fragment was cultured

In total, 130 E. coli isolates were obtained from the three swine
farms, including 30 fecal isolates, 26 indoor air isolates, 21 down-
wind air isolates, 21 river water isolates, 14 silt isolates, and 18
soil isolates (Table 1). No isolates were obtained from upwind air
samples.

3.2. Antibiotic susceptibility test and determination of MIC value of cipro-
ﬂoxacin, oﬂoxacin, and nalidixic acid

The E. coli strains showed diverse susceptibility among swine farms
(Table 3). On the whole, the resistance rates were over 90% against TET,
64.10–84.78% against AMP, 66.67–79.49% against KAN, 60.00–76.09%
against SXT, and over 70% against GEN and STM. The isolates resistant
to CIP from fecal, indoor air, downwind air, river, soil and silt samples
were #24, #19, #16, #14, #12, and #10, respectively; those resistant
to OFX were #25, #19, #16, #15, #10, and #7; and those resistant to
NAL were #26, #22, #16, #14, and #9. Isolates from all three farms dem-
onstrated susceptibility to A/S, P/T, ATM, and AMK. In addition, six iso-
lates from farm B were resistant to ATM.

All E. coli isolates from the three farms were resistant to at least three
antibiotics. Resistance to eight antibiotics (23.08%) was the most preva-
lent phenotype among all strains, followed by resistance to seven anti-
biotics (15.38%). E. coli isolates obtained from farm A were resistant to
3–11 antibiotics, while isolates from farms B and C were resistant to
3–13 antibiotics.

The MICs of the 130 E. coli isolates were determined by the
microdilution method. The MIC values of ciproﬂoxacin, oﬂoxacin, and
nalidixic acid were mainly in the ranges of 2–64, 8–64, and 8–64 μg/mL,
which correspond to low-medium resistance and less highly resistant.

3.3. Detection results of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes

The genes detected among the 130 E. coli isolates were qnrA,
qnrB, qnrS, aac(6′)-Ib, aac(6′)-Ib-cr, qepA, and oqxAB. In total,

82.31% (107/130) of the E. coli
isolates carried at least one
PMQR gene, and Table 4 shows the different association patterns
of PMQR genes per strain (including for each type of sample:
fecal, indoor air, downwind air, and so on). The results showed
that 63 isolates carried one PMQR gene, 32 isolates carried two
PMQR genes, 10 isolates carried three PMQR genes, and 2 iso-
lates carried four PMQR genes. The detection rates of the qnrA,
qnrB, qnrS, aac(6′)-Ib, aac(6′)-Ib-cr, qepA, and oqxAB genes in
the E. coli isolates from the three swine farms were in the ranges
of 10.87–23.08%, 13.04–20.51%, 40.00–43.48%, 31.11–41.03%,
30.43–38.46%, 6.52–12.82%, and 7.69–17.39%, respectively.

All oqxA-positive isolates were also screened for oqxB. The dominant
PMQR gene was the qnrS gene, and the detection rate of the qepA gene
was the lowest among all the swine farms investigated. The QepA
gene was detected in ﬁve, four, and three isolates in the three farms,
respectively.

3.4. Sequence analysis of bacteria resistance genes qnrS and qnrB

The results of the 58 PCR positive product sequencing was 54
strains of qnrS and 4 false-positive results. In addition, the typing
results of the 54 qnrS positive strains showed that 39 of them
belonged to qnrS1 and 15 belonged to qnrS2. The result of 21 qnrB
PCR positive product sequencing was 19 strains of qnrB and 2
false-positive results. The typing results of 19 qnrB positive strains
showed that 10 of them belonged to qnrB2, six belonged to qnrB9,
and three belonged to qnrB31.

The E. coli isolates showed diverse PFGE proﬁles, which fully
reﬂected the genetic polymorphism of E. coli. The similarity of the
E. coli isolates was 65–100% in the three swine farms. The PFGE results
showed N85% similarity in 14, 11, 9, 7, and 10 isolates from indoor air,
outdoor air, soil, silt, and river samples, respectively. In swine farm A
(Fig. 1), the samples Dw100m-2 and Indoor-3 had N85% similarity to
the Fecal-5 sample and carried the same PMQR genes: qnrA and qnrS.
In swine farm B (Fig. 2), the samples Dw10m-1, Dw100m-1, and Soil
200m-2 had N85% similarity to the sample Fecal-3 and carried the
same PMQR gene, qnrB. The similarity between the samples Fecal-8
and Indoor-1 was 100%, and both carried the qnrS genes. In swine
farm C (Fig. 3), the samples River100m-2, Indoor-6, and Soil100m-2
had above 85% similarity to Fecal-1 and carried the same PMQR gene,
qnrS. The similarity between samples Fecal-3 and Soil200m-3 was
100%, and both carried qnrS genes and aac(6′)-Ib-cr genes. Some isolates
were detected in multiple types of samples along the environmental
transmission gradient from feces to soil, and they carried the same resis-
tance genes.

4. Discussion

In this study, 130 E. coli Isolates from different swine farms all
showed high resistance against (ﬂuoro) quinolones (CIP, OFX, and
NAL), aminoglycosides (GEN, KAN, and STM), TET, SXT, and AMP. The
resistance rate against (ﬂuoro)quinolones was in the range of
74.36–82.61%, which is consistent with previous studies (Gao et al.,

2015; Zhu et al., 2011; Xiao et al., 2011). Furthermore, 93.08% (121/
130) of the isolates were sensitive to at least 5 antibiotics, and some
were sensitive to as many as 10–13 antibiotics. Antibiotic susceptibility
was similar between farms, but there was also a large difference in drug
resistance among individuals, which may be related to the different
management systems of drug use in the different farms. This indicated
that the high resistance rate might be related to the multiple and inap-
propriate use of these antibiotics (Teuber, 2001; Lipsitch et al., 2002;
Rosa and Carlos, 2013). The PMQR genes were very common in the
farms, with 82.31% (107/130) of the E. coli isolates carrying at least
one. qnrS and aac(6′)-Ib-cr were the main PMQR genes, and multiple
PMQR genes coexisted in the same isolates, which improves the resis-
tance of the bacteria to antimicrobial drugs. In the qnr gene family,
two variants of qnrS were detected: qnrS1 and qnrS2. There are many
variants of qnrB, the most easily mutated genotype (Wang et al.,
2011), which is consistent with our results. Variable qnr resistance
genes in E. coli could signiﬁcantly improve the resistance to quinolones.
In animal houses, there are large amounts of feces and waste con-
taining resistant bacteria, which could enter into the air through animal
activities and form into bio-aerosols. The transmission of bio-aerosols
carrying pathogens or resistant bacteria could pose threats for animals
and public health. PFGE experiments on E. coli with different sources
in different swine house showed that their similarity was very high
(as much as 100%). A total of 47 E. coli isolates were obtained from in-
door air samples and outdoor air samples at 10 m, 50 m, 100 m,
200 m, and 400 m downwind. PFGE showed that 25 isolates were clon-
ally related to fecal isolates, including 9 isolates carrying the same PMQR
genes, which indicates that airborne transmission was a possible route

for E. coli carrying PMQR genes. In addition, the same origin as fecal iso-
lates was observed in 10 and 9 E. coli isolates from river water at 10 m,
50 m, 100 m, and 200 m away and from soil at 50 m, 100 m, 200 m, and
400 m away. Furthermore, 7 E. coli isolates from silt at 5 m, 10 m, and
20 m were clonally related to fecal isolates. This indicates that E. coli car-
rying PMQR genes and originating from indoor feces could transmit be-
tween the internal and external environments of the swine farms
through the river, air, soil, and silt.

It has been reported that approximately 75% of antibiotics cannot be
absorbed by animals and leak into the waste (Donohoe, 1984; Chee et al.,
2009). Although some antibiotics are discharged into surrounding rivers
during irrigation or fertilization processes, most antibiotics in the open-
air lagoons are re-applied to the surrounding agricultural ﬁelds. Signiﬁ-
cant amounts of antibiotics can be found in manure and waste slurries
(Gavalchin and Katz, 2015; Pedro et al., 2009). Thus, antibiotic-resistant
bacteria from indoor feces could spread to surrounding environments
and pollute the air (≥400 m), river (≥200 m), soil (≥400 m), and silt
(≥200 m).

The transmission distance varies with the media, which might be
due to the high mobility of air and river water and the low mobility of
silt. The distance was much longer in soil than in river water, which
might be related to the artiﬁcial transmission by villagers' farming activ-
ities like irrigation, and this artiﬁcial spread could be unlimited
(McEachran et al., 2015; Sanchez et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2012). The trans-
mission of antibiotic-resistant E. coli not only poses a threat of infection
to the animals raised but also tends to cause the spread of epidemic dis-
eases. The detailed inﬂuences and mechanisms behind this transmis-
sion should be investigated further.

5. Conclusion

The present study revealed that E. coli carrying PMQR genes and
originating from feces in swine farms could spread to the external envi-
ronment. These bacteria pollute the nearby air, water, silt, and soil,
which could be a potential threat to the public environment and
human health.
