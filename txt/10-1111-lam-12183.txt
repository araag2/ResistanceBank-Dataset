Signiﬁcance and Impact of the Study: Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus are important
agents of foodborne diseases. Occurrence of these infectious agents was established in meat and meat
products in Zaria, Nigeria. Majority of isolates obtained from this study, displayed multidrug resistance
to commonly used antimicrobial agents, including methicillin resistance among the Staph. aureus iso-
lates. The potential virulence of L. monocytogenes found in ready-to-eat food was documented by the
carriage of hly A gene by one of the isolates. A different mechanism of methicillin resistance or differ-
ent homologue of mec A gene may be circulating among Nigerian isolates.

Abstract

The bacterial genera Listeria and Staphylococcus have been frequently isolated
from food products and are responsible for a number of animal and human
diseases. The aim of the study was to simultaneously isolate and characterize
L. monocytogenes and Staphylococcus species from 300 samples of raw meat and
meat products, to determine the susceptibility of the organisms to commonly
used antimicrobial agents and to determine the presence of haemolysin A (hyl)
virulence gene in L. monocytogenes and staphylococcal cassette chromosome
mecA (SCCmec) gene in the Staph. aureus isolates using PCR. Of the 85
Listeria isolates tested, 12 L. monocytogenes were identiﬁed and tested for their
sensitivity to 14 antimicrobial agents. All the 12 isolates (100%) were resistant
to nine antimicrobial agents, but however sensitive to gentamicin. Only one
isolate was
found to harbour the hylA gene. Twenty-nine isolates were
conﬁrmed as Staph. aureus by the Microbact 12S identiﬁcation system and
were all presumptively identiﬁed as methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus species
using oxacillin-resistant Staph. aureus basal medium (ORSAB). The 29
Staph. aureus
isolates were tested for their sensitivity to 16 antimicrobial
agents, and 11 were resistant to methicillin. None of the 11 Staph. aureus
isolates harboured the methicillin resistance, mecA gene.

Introduction

Meat is generally regarded as one of the most commonly
consumed and nutritious items of human diet (Fapohunda
et al. 1985). In the Nigerian markets, many different types
of ready-to-eat meat and meat products are available
in diversity of forms as delicacies, which include ‘suya’,

‘balangu’, ‘kilishi’ (Igene et al. 1983) and ‘dambun nama’.
The high ambient temperature and humidity coupled with
poor handling practices predispose such meat products to
massive microbial contamination and rapid deterioration
(Abdullahi et al. 2006). Several micro-organisms have been
incriminated in foodborne illnesses resulting from con-
sumption of contaminated meat and meat products. These

Listeria and Staphylococcus in meat

organisms include Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocyt-
ogenes, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus
cereus, Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens (Saide-
Alboronz et al. 1995). The genus Listeria consists of a
group of Gram-positive rod-shaped bacteria with eight
species, L. monocytogenes, L. ivanovii, L. seeligeri, L. innoc-
ua, L. welshimeri and L. grayi. Two new species, L. marthii
and L. roucourtiae, have been recently reported (Leclercq
et al. 2009). However, only L. monocytogenes and L. ivano-
vii exhibit pathogenic features, with human cases of L. iva-
novii infection being quite rare (Cummins et al. 1994).
There have been reports of listeria-associated gastroenteri-
tis following the consumption of different food types (Frye
et al. 2002). Listeria monocytogenes is well known for its
ability to form bioﬁlms and to establish harbourages on
food-processing equipment (stainless steel, plastic and
rubber surfaces), making its eradication even more difﬁ-
cult, which may allow the contamination of ready-to-eat
food products (Carpentier and Cerf 2011). Its presence in
faeces or on the hides of food animals facilitates its entry
into meat slaughter areas, onto carcasses and subsequently
onto raw meat products (Peter and Rachel 2007). Listeria
can grow and multiply at temperatures between 3°C and
45°C or even lower (Mejlholm et al. 2010).

Staph. aureus

Staphylococci are ubiquitous in nature, being isolated
frequently from food products and responsible for a
number of animal and human diseases (Payne and Wood
1974). Infections caused by Staph. aureus have been a
major cause of morbidity and mortality in humans (Kloos
1997). Methicillin-resistant
is
known to be one of
the most prevalent nosocomial
pathogens throughout the world and to be capable of
causing a wide range of hospital-linked infections (Lee
2003); it can also serve as source of community acquired
infections and spread of MRSA. Products bought in the
markets are a reﬂection of human and environmental
contamination at point of sale due to products being dis-
played uncovered and subjected to handling by prospec-
tive buyers (Adesiyun 1984).
In developed countries,
stringent control of antibiotic use coupled with effective

(MRSA)

surveillance of antibiotic resistance patterns in the popu-
lation has successfully reduced the prevalence of antibiotic
resistance in infectious agents (Davies and Davies 2010).
The situation is however different in less developed coun-
tries such as Nigeria, where antimicrobial agents are read-
ily available for purchase in local drug stores without
prescription. Such a practice has led to misuse of antibi-
otics with the associated high prevalence of antibiotic
resistance among Staphylococcus species (Adekeye 1979;
Paul et al. 1982). The aim of this study was to determine
the presence of Staph. aureus, including methicillin-resis-
tant strains and L. monocytogenes in raw meat and ready-
to-eat meat products and their public health signiﬁcance
in Zaria, Nigeria.

Results and discussion

â

Of the 300 analysed, 85 isolates were characterized as
Listeria species by conventional biochemical tests. These
were further subjected to latex agglutination test, of which
40 were identiﬁed as Listeria species. The 40 Listeria iso-
12L test sys-
lates were further tested using the Microbact
tem which conﬁrmed 12 isolates as Listeria monocytogenes;
the other 24 Listeria species conﬁrmed were L. ivanovii (19
isolates), L. seeligeri (1 isolate) and L. grayi (four isolates).
Four of the 40 isolates did not meet the 75% cut-off point
12L
criteria for species identiﬁcation by the Microbact
test, even though three were found to belong to the species
L. monocytogenes with levels of probability at 5052, 4414
and 4414%, and one to the species L. seeligeri had 5212%
level of probability (Table 1).

â

All the 12 L. monocytogenes isolates were found to be
resistant to nine of the 14 commonly used antimicrobial
agents tested. However, most of the isolates were suscepti-
ble to the aminoglycosides, gentamicin and kanamycin,
and also to ciproﬂoxacin.

The susceptibility testing of 12 L. monocytogenes iso-
lates gave seven antimicrobial resistance patterns, with ‘P,
SXT, E, AMC, F, C, TE, S, AMP, MY, W’ and ‘P, SXT, E,
AMC, F, TE, S, AMP, MY, W’ having the highest

frequency of occurrence (three times each) and P, SXT,
E, F, C, TE, S, AMP, MY, W (two times). Although the
other patterns appeared only once, the antibiotics P, SXT,
F, TE, AMP, S, MY and W appeared in all the patterns.
The PCR results showed that only one of the 12 isolates
(SMS3) was found to harbour the hylA gene (Fig. 1).

Of the 300 samples of raw meat and meat products
analysed, 101 isolates of Staphylococcus species were char-
acterized by conventional biochemical tests giving a prev-
alence rate of 337%. The raw meat samples had the
highest isolation rate of 311% followed by suya (289%).
Kilishi yielded the least number of Staphylococcus species
positive samples of 83% (Table 2).

Forty isolates, proportionately distributed among the
different sample types were selected out of the 101 isolates
â
of Staphylococcus species and tested by the Microbact
12S identiﬁcation system, which resulted in the conﬁrma-
tion of 29 Staph. aureus,
four Staph. intermedius and
three Staph. hyicus species. Four of the 40 isolates did not
meet the criteria for acceptance by the Microbact 12S
identiﬁcation test system, but three were found to belong
to the species Staph. hyicus, having the following per cent
probabilities: (5016, 4982 and 3616%) and one to the
specie Staph. aureus with a per cent probability of 6466%
(Table 2).

All the 29 Staph. aureus isolates tested were found to
be resistant to one or more of the 16 antimicrobial agents

agents. Low levels of

used, with high percentage resistance to the beta-lactam
antimicrobial
resistance were
observed to gentamicin, sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim
and nitrofurantoin. The susceptibility testing gave 22 anti-
microbial resistance patterns, with ‘P, AMP, MY’ having
the highest frequency of occurrence, followed by ‘P, S,
AMP, MY; P, AMC, TE, AMP, MY, MY’. Although the
other patterns appeared only once, P, AMP, MY, MET
and OX beta-lactams
in these
patterns (Table 3).

appeared repeatedly

Although all the 29 conﬁrmed Staph. aureus isolates
tested using ORSAB medium were found to give methicil-
lin-resistance phenotype, only 11 were found to be methi-
cillin resistant following the Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion
method. The PCR results showed that none of the 11
Staph. aureus isolates tested was found to harbour the
mecA gene.

The 4% prevalence of L. monocytogenes established in
this work is an indication that ready-to-eat meat products
contaminated with Listeria spp were being offered for sale
in Zaria and this is of public health concern. This preva-
lence is lower than the 92% prevalence reported by
Chukwu et al. (2006) from retailed smoked ﬁsh in Jos,
Nigeria and higher than the 24% from meat and meat
products in Morocco earlier reported by Ennaji et al.
(2008). It is however similar to the 47% reported by
in Turkey.

Adesiyun (1984), Umoh et al. (1990) and Abdullahi et al.
(2005) also reported high levels of contamination of
ready-to-eat meat and various foods with Staphylococcus
species in Zaria. The differences in prevalence could also
be as a result of the different geographical
locations or
possibly due to methods of isolation and identiﬁcation. It
could additionally be due to the methods used in process-
ing the meat products because there are no established
and regulated methods. The highest rate of isolation of
Listeria and Staphylococcus species from raw meat may be
due to the fact that it has not been subjected to heat
treatment and no condiments added that could either kill
or suppress the growth of
these organisms. This was
followed by ‘suya’, which could suggest environmental
contamination because when prepared, ‘suya’ is not left
on the ﬁre to keep it hot such as ‘balangu’. ‘Kilishi’ had
the least rate of isolation, and this could be attributed to
the fact that it may have a lower water activity when
compared with all the other meat products sampled in
this study. The levels of contamination of the products
may also be an important point to consider.

Antimicrobial susceptibility of 12 L. monocytogenes to
14 antimicrobial agents showed all the isolates to be sus-
ceptible to gentamicin, which is similar to the ﬁndings of
Ennaji et al. (2008) and Aurelli et al. (2003). However, all
the isolates were resistant to nine of 14 antimicrobial
agents. The study of Ennaji et al. (2008) and Aurelli et al.

Listeria and Staphylococcus in meat

the

resistance patterns

(2003) reported that penicillin and ampicillin showed
good activity against L. monocytogenes, which was entirely
different from what we observed in this study, in which
all the isolates were resistant to these beta-lactam antimi-
crobial agents. This increasing resistance may be due to
indiscriminate use of antimicrobial agents. There were
resistance patterns observed for
seven antimicrobial
L. monocytogenes. All
showed
multiple resistance with high frequency of resistance to
sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim, nitrofuran-
penicillin,
toin,
lincomycin
and trimethoprim. There have been reports of acquired
multiple resistance in L. monocytogenes mediated by self-
transferable plasmids (Charpentier and Courvalin 1999).
As all the L. monocytogenes isolates showed multiple resis-
tance to antimicrobial agents, the implication could be
that the cost of treatment will be very high when humans
are infected with these zoonotic pathogens; these ﬁndings
are in agreement with the reports of Lungu et al. (2011).

streptomycin, ampicillin,

tetracycline,

Only one of the 12 isolates was found to harbour the
hlyA gene, which is not in agreement with the results
obtained by Jallewor et al. (2007) who reported the car-
riage of hlyA by almost all isolates of L. monocytogenes.
This may be due to the fact that not all L. monocytogenes
are virulent, because some are considered as environmen-
tal strains. The presence of hlyA virulence gene in multi-
drug-resistant zoonotic bacteria will be of great concern
to clinicians in treatment of patients infected by such an
organism. The fact that such an organism was isolated
from ready-to-eat meat product raises the possibility of
occurrence of such an isolate in other food products of
animal origin such as milk or local milk products. As
L. monocytogenes isolates were obtained from ready-to-eat
meat products, this organism is likely to have originated
in the environment.

antimicrobial

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 29 Staph. aureus
showed all the isolates to be resistant to one or more of
the
agents used, but none was
simultaneously resistant to all the antimicrobial agents.
Eighty-two per cent of the isolates were susceptible to gen-
tamicin, sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim and nitrofuran-
toin, respectively, but the isolates were least susceptible to
the beta-lactam antimicrobial agents and tetracycline. The
resistance of these isolates to the beta-lactam antimicrobial
agents could be due to the indiscriminate use of such anti-
microbial agents in both human and veterinary medicine
due to their availability and affordability. In the USA,
Staph. aureus
reported to be the most commonly
resistant organisms to methicillin and other members of
the beta-lactam antimicrobial agents; and Staph. aureus
isolates were reported to have multiple resistance to
antimicrobial drugs (Carla et al. 2009). This resistance is
said to severely hamper treatment options.

There were

22

antimicrobial

resistance patterns
observed with the Staph. aureus
isolates, of which 18
showed multiple resistance. The isolates showed high
frequency of
to penicillin, ampicillin and
lincomycin, which appeared in 18 of the 22 patterns. The
frequency of resistance to penicillin, ampicillin and linco-
mycin was similar to the reports of Kwaga and Adesiyun
(1984), Umoh et al. (1990) and Abdullahi et al. (2005),
respectively, who reported wide spread resistance of staph-
ylococci to ampicillin and penicillin. The multiple resis-
tance of these isolates to the commonly used antimicrobial
agents is of serious public health importance in terms of
treatment options. As antimicrobial resistance may be car-
ried on plasmids and other mobile genetic elements, there
may be possibility of transfer of these multiple resistance
to other bacterial species. Comparison of methicillin resis-
tance by the use of ORSAB test and the disk diffusion
isolates
method showed that all
expressed methicillin-resistance phenotype using
the
ORSAB test, while the disk diffusion test showed only 11
of the 29 isolates to be resistant to methicillin. The disk
diffusion test is a standard method of determining the sus-
ceptibility of isolates to antimicrobial agents, while the
ORSAB test is a presumptive test that helps in identifying
possible methicillin-resistant isolates. We suggest therefore
that more work be carried out to validate the use of
ORSAB as a rapid method for accurate detection of methi-
cillin-resistant isolates.

the 29 Staph. aureus

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out on 11
Staph. aureus isolates that were phenotypically resistant to
methicillin and oxacillin to detect carriage of mecA gene.
The result showed that none of the isolates tested was
found to harbour the mecA gene. The absence of mecA
gene from the 11 Staph. aureus suggested that the isolates
may not harbour the mecA gene or might have lost the
gene during subculturing (Van Griethuysen et al. 2005).
Earlier report of mecA indicated the risk of losing mecA-
bearing plasmids during subculturing and storage. It is
also possible that the primers used could not amplify the
mecA gene because of the existence of different variants
of the gene (Garcia-Alvarez et al. 2011). In Staph. aureus,
resistance to penicillin occurs through two mechanisms:
the production of
the beta-lactamase enzyme and the
resistance encoded by the mecA gene. Resistance to methi-
cillin by the eleven isolates therefore could be as a result
of the production of the beta-lactamase enzyme encoded
by the blaZ gene.

It appears

such as plasmids,

transposons and
mobile elements,

that other mechanism(s) may be
involved in the methicillin resistance than due to mec
genes, which is traditionally considered to contribute to
the resistance, and this is in agreement with an earlier

report
(Weller 1999). Studies conducted by Garcia-
Alvarez et al. (2011) reported that molecular techniques
for detection of MRSA with PCR or slide agglutination
tests do not detect certain strains of MRSA isolated in the
United Kingdom and Denmark. The study identiﬁed a
novel mecA homologue that shows phenotypic resistance
to methicillin but was negative for mecA using PCR. This
means that when these tests are used either for primary
detection or for conﬁrmation of MRSA, a chance exists
that a false-negative result is obtained. The search for this
MRSA strain also yielded several
isolates that had an
MRSA phenotype, but no mecA gene that could be
detected by PCR. This may explain the results obtained in
this study regarding failure to detect mecA gene among
the isolates. The isolates may possess other mecA homo-
logues or other mechanisms
leading to beta-lactam
resistance. Diagnostic protocols, whether for clinical or
epidemiological purposes, should consider the ramiﬁca-
tions of not detecting Staph. aureus strains that carry this
new mecA homologue.

In conclusion, raw meat and meat products in Zaria,
Nigeria, were found to be commonly contaminated with
L. monocytogenes
and Staph. aureus, which displayed
resistance to several antimicrobial agents. The antimicro-
bial resistance patterns of the two organisms may be sug-
gestive of the extent of misuse of antibiotics in medical
and veterinary practices in Nigeria. Similarly, the level of
contamination of raw meat and meat products with
L. monocytogenes and Staphylococcus species may be an
indication of human and environmental contamination
and should be regarded as being potentially hazardous to
consumers.

Materials and methods

Samples of meat and meat products were obtained from
Zaria city and Tudun wada markets in Zaria local govern-
ment area, and from Sabon gari and Samaru markets in
Sabon gari local government areas and from Zango abat-
toir in Sabon gari local government area.

Sample collection was based on convenience sampling
method. Three hundred representative samples of all sam-
ple types (suya’, ‘balangu’, ‘kilishi’, ‘dambun nama’ and
raw beef) were obtained based on their availability in the
market. Adequate quantities of each product were col-
lected in the manner offered to prospective customers
and then placed aseptically into a sterile polythene bag
and transported to the laboratory in coleman box with
ice packs.

Aseptically, 10 g of each sample was added to 90 ml
Listeria enrichment broth (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK)
containing Selective Listeria Enrichment Supplement in a

Listeria and Staphylococcus in meat

stomacher (Coldworth Stomacher, Seward, London) at
room temperature and incubated at 30°C for 24 h. Liste-
ria species were isolated on chromogenic Listeria agar
(Oxoid) and identiﬁed using the following conventional
biochemical methods: Gram staining, catalase, aesculin,
triple sugar iron (TSI) reaction, urease, sugar fermenta-
tion tests (lactose, sucrose, mannitol and xylose) and
haemolysis on 5% sheep blood agar (Barrow and Feltham
1995). Isolates suspected to be Listeria species were tested
using the Oxoid Listeria latex agglutination kit (Oxiod,
Basingstoke, UK). Positive isolates of the Latex test were
12S test systems to
further tested using the Microbact
conﬁrm the species of Listeria (Oxiod, Basingstoke, UK).
Staphylococcus species were isolated using Baird–Parker
agar (Oxoid) and identiﬁed using the following conven-
tional biochemical methods: Gram staining, catalase,
coagulase, sugar fermentation (mannitol, glucose, xylose
and arabinose), haemolysis on 5% sheep blood agar, pig-
mentation (mannitol salt agar) and DNase activity as
described by Barrow and Feltham (1995). Forty presump-
tive Staphylococcus isolates were subjected to the Microb-
act 12S test systems (Oxiod, Basingstoke, UK).

The

susceptibilities

of

L. monocytogenes

and
Staph. aureus isolates to 14 and 16 antimicrobial agents,
respectively, were determined by the Kirby–Bauer disk dif-
fusion method on Mueller–Hinton agar (Bauer et al. 1966)
and interpreted according to the recommendations of Clin-
ical Laboratory Standard Institute (2004). The antimicro-
bial agents and their respective concentrations used for
both organisms were as follows: penicillinG 10 IU, sulpha-
methoxazole trimethoprim 25 lg, gentamicin 10 lg, cipro-
ﬂoxacin 5 lg, erythromycin 15 lg, amoxicillin–clavulanic
acid 30 lg, nitrofurantoin 50 lg, hloramphenicol 30 lg,
tetracycline 30 lg, streptomycin 10 lg, kanamycin 30 lg,
ampicillin 10 lg,
lincomycin 10 lg, trimethoprim 5 lg;
while methicillin 5 lg and oxacillin 1 lg were added to the
panel for Staph. aureus. Oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus basal medium (ORSAB) was also used to determine
methicillin resistance. All
agents were
obtained from Oxoid

antimicrobial
Ltd, Basingstoke, UK.

Establishment of the virulence potentials of Listeria
monocytogenes using PCR, targeting the hylA gene

â

PCR was used to detect the presence of hylA virulence
gene. Pure DNA was obtained using a DNA extraction kit
(ZYMO
, Inqaba biotech, South Africa). Ampliﬁcation
of the hlyA gene was carried out using Lis 1 – 5′- GCAT
CTGCATTCAATAAAGA -3′ (forward) and Lis 2 – 5′- TG
TCACTGCATCTCCGTGGT -3′ (reverse) primers (Border
et al. 1990), yielding a PCR product of 174 bp. PCR
was performed in a 25 ll volume containing 125 ll
DreamTaqTM PCR Master Mix, 10 ll
template DNA,

125 ll forward primer, 125 ll reverse primer. Ampliﬁca-
tion was carried out using 35 cycles of ampliﬁcation at
95°C for 45 s, 60°C for 45 s, 72°C for 1 min, with an ini-
tial denaturation at 95°C for 4 min and a ﬁnal extension
at 72°C for 5 min. This was carried out in a Thermal
cycler (Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR system 9700
version 305). The amplicons were run in 15% agarose
gel. A 100-bp DNA ladder (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland)
was used. An automatic UV transilluminator (UVtec,
Sigma, Germany) was used to view the bands of the PCR
products and photographed using a Bioproﬁle gel docu-
mentation system (Mitsubishi, Tokyo, Japan).

PCR was used to detect the presence of mecA gene in 11
Staph. aureus isolates. Pure DNA was obtained using a
Inqaba biotech, South
DNA extraction kit (ZYMO
Africa). Ampliﬁcation of
the mecA gene was carried
out using the primers MR1 5′AAAATCGATGGTAA
AGGTTGGC-3′
and MR25′-AGTTCT
GCAGTACCGGATTTGC-3′ (reverse; Lee 2003), yielding a
PCR product of 533 bp. PCR was performed in a 25 ll vol-
ume containing 25 ll MgCl2, 25 ll RT buffer, 25 ll
 1), 1 ll
dNTPs, 1 ll mecA forward primer (10 pm ll
 1), 05 ll Taq polymerase,
mecA reverse primer (10 pm ll
25 ll template DNA, 125 ll nuclease free water. Ampliﬁ-
cation was carried out using 40 cycles at 94°C for 30 sec-
onds, 55°C for 30 seconds and 72º C for 1 min, with an
initial denaturation at 94°C for 4 min and ﬁnal extension
step at 72°C for 5 min. This was carried out in a Thermal
cycler (Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR system 9700
version 305). The amplicons were run in 15% agarose gel.
A positive control Staph. aureus
isolate (ATCC 33591
strain) for mecA gene with an expected band size of 533 bp
was used. A 100-bp DNA ladder (Finnzymes, Espoo,
Finland) was used.
