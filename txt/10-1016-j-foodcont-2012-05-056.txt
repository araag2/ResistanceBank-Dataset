This study was aimed to determine the prevalence of Salmonella spp. in foods of animal origin sold at
retail stores over the period 2005e2011 in San Luis, Argentina. Characterization of isolates was per-
formed by biochemical and serological tests, antimicrobial susceptibility assays, detection of invA inva-
sion gene by PCR and comparison of genomic proÔ¨Åles by XbaI DNA restriction and PFGE. Twenty seven
Salmonella strains were detected in 27 (6.32%) of 427 samples of foods analysed. Sixteen S. Enteritidis and
one S. Montevideo strains from chicken meat (17 positive samples/115 total samples), six S. Anatum
strains from pork sausages (6/90), two S. Typhimurium strains from liquid egg (2/60) and two S. Mon-
tevideo strains from chicken giblets (2/62) were isolated. No Salmonella strains were recovered from
chicken carcasses (0/100). Salmonella strains were susceptible to antimicrobials commonly used for
clinical treatment. All isolates carried the invA gene. DNA restriction and PFGE analysis revealed similar
genomic proÔ¨Åles within each Salmonella serovar regardless of the food type, sampling year, or retail store
where samples were purchased, suggesting the possibility of circulation and transmission of clones of
limited diversity in our region.

1. Introduction

Salmonella spp. includes a large number of serovars that inhabit
the intestinal tract of various domestic and wild animal species.
Some of them have a predilection for a particular host and cause
disease in humans and animals, while others are in a large number
of reservoirs allowing them to spread to the environment (Ibar
et al., 2009).

In humans, salmonellosis is usually related to the consumption
of contaminated foods. Typical foodstuffs from which Salmonella
has been isolated include pork (Prendergast et al., 2009), chicken
meat (Chen, Hwang, Wang, Shih, & Tsen, 2011; White et al., 2007),
eggs (Fearnley, Raupach, Lagala, & Cameron, 2011; Murchie et al.,
2007), bovine meat (Gallegos-Robles et al., 2009), dairy products
(De Buyser, Dufour, Maire, & Lafarge, 2001) and vegetables
(Sant‚ÄôAna, Landgraf, Destro, & Franco, 2011).

In recent years, Salmonella infections have been the most
frequently illnesses reported (17.6 per 100,000 persons) in United
States. The most common serovars were S. Enteritidis, S. Newport

and S. Typhimurium (CDC, 2011). In Latin America, PulseNet Latin
America and Caribbean Network working between 2005 and 2009
was able to collect 849 Salmonella spp. strains associated to
outbreak and sporadic cases. These strains included 70 S. Typhi, 554
S. Typhimurium and 225 S. Enteritidis from Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
Colombia, Costa Rica and Paraguay (Campos et al., 2012). Other-
wise, Sant‚ÄôAna et al. (2011), demonstrated the presence of S.
Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium from minimally processed vegeta-
bles in Brazil, while in Chile, Salmonella was isolated from 6 out of
560 samples of chicken carcasses and giblets (Ulloa, Gonz√°lez,
Hern√°ndez, Villanueva, & Fern√°ndez, 2010). In Uruguay, eggs and
chicken meat were identiÔ¨Åed as the source of infection during an
outbreak due to Salmonella Enteritidis (Betancor et al., 2010).

In Argentina, a signiÔ¨Åcant increase in the number of S. Enter-
itidis isolates from foods associated with foodborne outbreaks has
been observed since 1987 (Caffer & Eiguer, 1994). During the period
2000e2005,
the National Reference Laboratory studied 443
Salmonella isolates derived from foods associated to outbreaks and
reported S. Enteritidis (31.8%), S. Typhimurium (19.6%), S. Newport
(6.9%), S. Agona (6.1%) and other serovars in a lower frequency. On
the other hand, from 2006 S. Typhimurium was the most frequent
serovar isolated from humans, animals and foods (Caffer et al.,
2010). Although Salmonella foodborne outbreaks are uncommon

50

in our region, the consumption of slightly cooked poultry, pork and
meat products and the preparation of pastry, mousse, mayonnaise
and other foods using unpasteurized raw eggs constitute the major
risk of Salmonella illness for consumers (Satorres, Pederiva, &
Centorbi, 1998).
the vertical and horizontal
contamination of eggs by Salmonella serovars has been demon-
strated (Martelli & Davies, 2012).

In this regard,

Concern about poultry, meats and other foodstuffs contami-
nated with foodborne pathogens has gained considerable attention
because of
the increased incidence of antimicrobial-resistant
bacteria associated with human illness (Khan, Melvin, & Dagdag,
2007). Some authors have reported that the antimicrobial resis-
tance of Salmonella strains may be associated with the expression of
certain virulence genes including invA (Dione et al., 2011). This gene
is carried on a region of the bacterial chromosome known as the
Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1) and encodes a factor
related to the process of invasion of the intestinal epithelium. The
demonstration of invA gene in Salmonella isolates can be epide-
miologically relevant (Chacon, Barrantes, Garcia, & Achi, 2010).

A molecular technique such as pulsed-Ô¨Åeld gel electrophoresis
(PFGE) is used for subtyping of Salmonella spp. isolates. Several
studies indicate that PFGE may offer an improved level of
discrimination over other genotypic methods for the epidemio-
logical characterization of Salmonella spp. The use of PFGE in
combination with XbaI DNA restriction has been widely recognized
as a reference method for Ô¨Ångerprinting Salmonella serovars
(Ammari et al., 2009a; Kalender, Sen, Hasman, Hendriksen, &
Aarestrup, 2009).

The objectives of this study were i) to determine the prevalence
of Salmonella spp. in foods of animal origin for human consumption
in our region ii) to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of the
isolated strains, iii) to assess the presence of the invA virulence gene
by PCR, and iv) to determine possible genetic relationships among
these Salmonella isolates by PFGE.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sample collection

A total of 427 samples were purchased at random over the
period 2005e2011from twelve retail stores and supermarkets
located in San Luis City, Argentina. The studied samples were: i)
chicken meat (n ¬º 115), including chicken thigh, leg and breast, ii)
chicken carcass (n ¬º 100), iii) chicken giblets (n ¬º 62), iv) liquid
eggs (n ¬º 60) and v) pork sausages (n ¬º 90). After purchase, each
sample was transported in its original container under refrigeration
and used for Salmonella isolation and identiÔ¨Åcation within 24 h of
collection.

2.2. Microbiological analysis

Salmonella cultures from all samples were performed according
to the FDA Bacteriological Analytical Manual
(Andrews &
Hammack, 2007) with some modiÔ¨Åcations. Typical colonies from
each medium were picked and tested by Gram staining and stan-
dard biochemical methods (Le Minor, 1984). Serological tests for
Salmonella strains were performed using poly-O antiserum (SanoÔ¨Å
SA, Paris, France). Results were conÔ¨Årmed by Reference Center for
Enterobacteria, National Institute of Infectious Diseases INEI-ANLIS,
Buenos Aires, Argentina.

2.3. Antimicrobial susceptibility

The antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella isolates was
determined by the disk diffusion method on Mueller Hinton agar

(MH; Britania, Buenos Aires, Argentina) performed according to the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines (CLSI, 2009).
The following antibiotic disks (Britania) were used: ampicillin,
10 mg (AMP); colistin 10 mg (COL); chloramphenicol, 30 mg (CHL);
gentamicin,
(TET);
trimethoprimesulfamethoxazole, 25 mg (TMS); ciproÔ¨Çoxacin, 5 mg
(CIP); neomycin, 30 mg (NEO); kanamycin, 30 mg (KAN); furazoli-
done, 5 mg (FUR); nalidixic acid, 30 mg (NAL); cefotaxime, 30 mg
(CTX); ceftriaxone, 30 mg (CRO) and phosphomycin, 50 mg (PHO).
Zones of growth inhibition were evaluated according to CLSI
standards (2009). Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was used as a control
strain.

2.4. Polymerase chain reaction for detection of invA gene

DNA extraction was made using a boiling protocol as described
by Leotta et al. (2005). PCR was performed in a thermal cycler
Techne TC-512 (Techne Inc., Duxford, UK). A 25 ml volume of
a reaction mix containing 1X PCR buffer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 1 pmol/ml of each speciÔ¨Åc primer (forward 50-CAA AGG TTC
AGA ACG TGT CG-30and reverse 50-GAT ATT CCG CCC CAT ATT
ATC-30), 0.04 U/ml Taq polymerase, 2 ml template, and ultrapure
water was prepared. The primers were designed in this study
using the PubMed database (GenBank accession number
M90846.1) and OligoCalc software (Kibbe WA.
‚ÄòOligoCalc: an
online oligonucleotide properties calculator‚Äô, 2007). PCR was
performed as follows: 94 C for 3 min, then 30 cycles of 94 C for
30 s, 60 C for 30 s and 72 C for 30 s, and a Ô¨Ånal extension of
72 C for 5 min. The products were analysed by 2% agarose gel
electrophoresis in comparison with a 100-bp molecular weight
DNA marker (Productos Biol√≥gicos, Quilmes, Argentina). The
bands were visualized by staining with GelRed√í Acid Gel Stain
(Biotum, Hayward, CA, USA), 1.5 ml stock solution/40 ml gel, and
photographed with a 6.0 mega pixels digital camera (Sony Cyber-
shot; Sony Corporation, New York, USA).

2.5. Pulsed-Ô¨Åeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE)

DNA preparation was as described previously (Ribot et al.,
2006). Chromosomal DNA contained in agarose plugs was diges-
ted with 10 U of XbaI (Fermentas, Burlington Ontario, Canada), and
PFGE was performed with a CHEF-DRIII system (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA), using an electric Ô¨Åeld of 6 V/cm at 14 C, angle of 120 and
switching times of 1.8e20 s over 20 h. Migration of the DNA frag-
ments was achieved in a 1.0% pulsed-Ô¨Åeld agarose gel (Bio-Rad)
submerged in 0.5X TBE buffer (45 mmol/l Tris-Borate and 1 mmol/l
EDTA) and Salmonella Braenderup H9812 was used a molecular
reference marker. The gels were stained with Gel Red√í Acid Gel
Stain (Biotum) and photographed.

2.6. Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis on detection frequency of Salmonella strains
related to the food type studied was performed using Chi-square
test (Analytical Software, Tallahassee FL, USA). Calculations were
based on conÔ¨Ådence level equal or higher than 95% (p  0.05 was
considered statistically signiÔ¨Åcant).

The discrimination index (DI) values of PFGE were calculated by
Simpson‚Äôs diversity index, as presented by Hunter and Gaston
(1998). Clustering of the patterns obtained by the PFGE was per-
formed using Statistica 6.0 software (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA)
and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average
(UPGMA).

3.1. Prevalence of Salmonella serovars in foods

A total of 27 (6.32%) out of 427 samples of foods were Salmonella
spp. positive; the frequency of isolation was signiÔ¨Åcantly higher
from chicken meat than from the other samples (p  0.05). The
strains classiÔ¨Åed into four serovars were distributed as follows:
16 S. Enteritidis and one S. Montevideo strains from chicken meat
(17 positive samples/115 total samples), six S. Anatum strains from
pork sausages (6/90), two S. Montevideo strains from chicken
giblets (2/62) and two S. Typhimurium strains from liquid egg (2/
60). No Salmonella strains were recovered from chicken carcasses
(0/100). The most frequently isolated serovar was S. Enteritidis
(59.26%) followed by S. Anatum (22.22%), S. Montevideo (11.11%)
and S. Typhimurium (7.40%) (Table 1).

3.2. Antimicrobial susceptibility

All Salmonella strains were susceptible to ciproÔ¨Çoxacin, chlor-
amphenicol, colistin, gentamicin, kanamycin,
trimethoprime
sulfamethoxazole, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. All S. Enteritidis
and S. Montevideo strains were resistant to furazolidone, while S.
Anatum and S. Montevideo isolated from chicken giblets were
resistant to tetracycline. Resistance to nalidixic acid, ampicillin,
phosphomycin, or tetracycline was observed in some S. Enteritidis
strains. Two S. Typhi strains were resistant to neomycin (Table 2).

3.3. PCR

All strains ampliÔ¨Åed a 421 pb region corresponding to Salmo-

nella invA gene (data not shown).

No association between the antimicrobial resistance proÔ¨Åles

and the presence of invA gene was observed.

3.4. PFGE

PFGE of XbaI-digested genomic DNA from 27 Salmonella isolates
showed four different macrorestriction proÔ¨Åles, each correspond-
ing to a different serovar. No differences were observed between
PFGE proÔ¨Åles of S. Montevideo when isolates from different foods
(chicken meat and chicken giblets) were compared. DNA restriction
patterns of 11, 14, 16 and 14 fragments ranging from 20.5 to 1135 kb
were obtained for S. Enteritidis, S. Montevideo, S. Anatum and S.
Typhimurium, respectively (Fig. 1).

samples)

The Salmonella search was positive in a 6.32% of 427 foods of
animal origin for human consumption analysed in our region. The
77.7% of positive Salmonella samples (21 samples/27 total samples)
corresponded to chicken products and the remaining 22.3% (6
samples/27 total
corresponded to pork sausages
(p  0.05). In a study performed in Mexico, Zaidi et al. (2006) found
high Salmonella spp. prevalence from pork (58.1%), beef (54%) and
poultry (39.7%). A high Salmonella prevalence was also observed by
Ibar et al. (2009) who reported 24.1% of Salmonella recovery from
386 porcine samples in slaughterhouses from Argentina. Salmonella
spp. is often found in the ovary or intestinal tract of food-producing
animals such chicken and pigs, respectively. During the slaughter,
this pathogen can contaminate carcasses and meats, resulting in
a source of foodborne illness. Several surveys have been under-
taken in poultry slaughterhouses to identify processing areas
where microbial cross-contamination can occur (Hinton, Cason, &
Ingram, 2004; Northcutt, Buhr, & Dickens, 2002). Similarly, pigs
can be reservoirs of serovars potentially pathogenic to humans and
source of infection through the consumption of their products
(GrifÔ¨Åth, Schwartz, & Meyerholdz, 2006). In this study, twenty
seven strains were isolated and the prevalence order of Salmonella
serovars was: S. Enteritidis (59.26%), S. Anatum (22.22%), S. Mon-
tevideo (11.11%) and S. Typhimurium (7.40%). Rivoal et al. (2009)
obtained 63.9% and 17.4% of S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium
respectively, from 144 whole liquid egg samples in France, and
Ammari et al .(2009b) reported the isolation of S. Enteritidis as
prevalent serovar from food samples in Morocco. Negative Salmo-
nella detection on chicken carcasses could be attributed to a low
contamination level undetectable by culture techniques, or to the
presence of injured bacteria which could not be re-grown during
enrichment.

In this study, resistances to ampicillin and nalidixic acid were
observed in 25 and 31% of S. Enteritidis strains, respectively.
Resistance to penicillins by Salmonella is attributable to the
acquired ability of the strains to produce b-lactamase. Instead,
quinolone resistance has been initially attributed to point muta-
tions in the gyrA gene encoding the A subunit of gyrase, whose
complex with DNA is the primary target. Changes at Ser-83 or at
Asp-87 of the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) in
the A subunit are the most frequent changes observed in nalidixic
acid-resistant strains (Hur, Jawale, & Lee, 2012). S. Typhimurium
isolated from liquid eggs were neomycin-resistant. Resistance to
aminoglycoside antibiotics in Salmonella is associated with modi-
fying enzymes which function by phosphorylating, acetylating or
adenylating certain aminoglycosides. Another resistance mecha-
nism is associated with the modiÔ¨Åcation of the drug-binding target
within the cell (Hur et al., 2012). Several Salmonella strains showed
resistance to tetracycline. This is highly associated with the acqui-
sition and expression of efÔ¨Çux pumps that reduce toxic levels of the
drug in the bacterial cells. In Salmonella, these efÔ¨Çux pumps are
encoded by the tet genes (Hur et al., 2012). Resistance to furazoli-
done and phosphomycin were also observed. However, most of
strains isolated in the present study were susceptible to antimi-
crobials commonly used for clinical treatment.

The invA gene has been widely used in studies for the detection of
Salmonella spp. in food samples (Chacon et al., 2010). In a study on
prevalence of virulence genes in non-typhoidal Salmonella isolated
from humans, animals and food products in Gambia and Senegal,
Dione et al. (2011) observed high prevalence (99.5%) of strains carrying
invA. They found signiÔ¨Åcant association between the presence of
this gene and other virulence genes and the antimicrobial resistance
to amoxicillin, ticarcillin, trimethoprimesulfamethoxazole, tetracy-
cline, trimethoprim, spectinomycin, streptomycin, sulfonamides and

in Korea.

Epidemiological investigation of this pathogen using molecular-
based methods is especially valuable. PFGE has been widely used to
determine strain relatedness, conÔ¨Årm outbreaks and identify the

sources of strains (Hur et al., 2011). In this study, PFGE was used for
subtyping Salmonella spp. strains. The PFGE analysis indicated that
some of the Salmonella isolates are indistinguishable and/or highly
related; the dendrogram showed that PFGE differentiated into
groupings that correlated with serovars. Moreover, PFGE analysis
revealed matching between S. Montevideo strains isolated from

chicken meat and giblets samples, suggesting that chicken can be
reservoirs and source of Salmonella dissemination in the region. The
similarity observed in DNA proÔ¨Åles within each Salmonella serovar
regardless of the food type, sampling year or retail store where
samples were purchased, suggested the possibility of circulation
and transmission of clones of limited diversity in our region. In
contrast, Rivoal et al. (2009) could discriminate different DNA
proÔ¨Åles among S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium or S. Infantis isolates
by using SpeI and XbaI restriction followed by PFGE. These authors
noted that XbaI enzyme permitted better discrimination than SpeI
enzyme within the Enteritidis serovar.

5. Conclusions

The present study showed low prevalence of Salmonella serovars
in foods of animal origin for human consumption in our region. The
highest Salmonella recovery was observed in chicken meat being S.
Enteritidis the predominant serovar. The invasion potential of strains
was assessed by detecting the invA gene by PCR. SigniÔ¨Åcant antimi-
crobial susceptibility was observed in all cases and PFGE revealed
homogeneous DNA restriction patterns within each serovar.

Isolation of Salmonella species from foods of animal origin in our
region emphasizes the need to continue the consumer‚Äôs education
on proper food handling and cooking practices to decrease the risk
of transmission of Salmonella from contaminated meat, poultry and
eggs products.

The Salmonella surveillance on these foods and the character-
ization of the isolates can contribute to the understanding of the
epidemiology of this pathogen and to alert to public health
organisms about risks for the human health.
