One mcr-1-carrying ST34-type Salmonella Typhimurium WW012 was cultured from
3,200 ready-to-eat (RTE) pork samples in 2014 in China. Broth dilution method was
applied to obtain the antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella Typhimurium WW012.
Broth matting assays were carried out to detect transferability of this phenotype
and whole-genome sequencing was performed to analyze its genomic characteristic.
Thirty out of 3,200 RTE samples were positive for Salmonella and the three most
frequent serotypes were identiﬁed as S. Derby (n = 8), S. Typhimurium (n = 6), and
S. Enteritidis (n = 6). One S. Typhimurium isolate (S. Typhimurium WW012) cultured
from RTE prepared pork was found to contain the mcr-1 gene. S. Typhimurium WW012
expressed a level of high resistance to seven different antimicrobial compounds in
addition to colistin (MIC = 8 mg/L). A single plasmid, pWW012 (151,609-bp) was
identiﬁed and found to be of an IncHI2/HI2A type that encoded a mcr-1 gene along with
six additional antimicrobial resistance genes. Plasmid pWW012 contained an IS30-mcr-
1-orf-orf-IS30 composite transposon that can be successfully transferred to Escherichia
coli J53. When assessed further, the latter demonstrated considerable similarity to
three plasmids pHYEC7-mcr-1, pSCC4, and pHNSHP45-2, respectively. Furthermore,
plasmid pWW012 also contained a multidrug resistance (MDR) genetic structure
IS26-aadA2-cmlA2-aadA1-IS406-sul3-IS26-dfrA12-aadA2-IS26, which showed high
similarity to two plasmids, pHNLDF400 and pHNSHP45-2, respectively. Moreover,
genes mapping to the chromosome (4,991,167-bp) were found to carry 28 mutations,
related to two component regulatory systems (pmrAB, phoPQ) leading to modiﬁcations

identiﬁed in this mcr-1 harboring S. Typhimurium. In addition, various virulence factors
and heavy metal resistance-encoding genes were also identiﬁed on the genome of S.
Typhimurium WW012. This is the ﬁrst report of the complete nucleotide sequence of
mcr-1-carrying MDR S. Typhimurium strain from RTE pork in China.

INTRODUCTION

Salmonella is often acquired from contaminated food, and is an
important zoonotic bacterium linked to cases of gastroenteritis
and bacteremia. This bacterium is now the leading cause of
global bacterial food poisoning out breaks and is associated
with increased morbidity and mortality (Kirk et al., 2015).
There are estimated to be 94 million cases of gastroenteritis
globally per year, with 155,000 deaths attributed to this
bacterium (Majowicz et al., 2010; Gallati et al., 2013). It was
reported that between 1994 and 2005, approximately 22% of
food borne infections in China were caused by Salmonella
(Wang et al., 2007). Of note, Salmonella Typhimurium is
one of the most prevalent serovars identiﬁed among these
food borne illnesses in China (Zhang et al., 2014). Salmonella
Typhimurium strains are most commonly isolated from retail
meat particularly pork in China, and both sporadic and outbreak-
associated cases of human salmonellosis caused by this bacterium
often need clinical therapy (Zhang et al., 2016). Moreover,
this bacterium has the potential
to act as a reservoir for
diﬀerent antimicrobial resistance-encoding genes (Zhang et al.,
2016).

resulting in structural modiﬁcation of

The relevance of S. Typhimurium is also marked by its
capability to acquire resistance determinants, to various drug
classes, especially those that are third-generation cephalosporins,
tetracyclines, (ﬂuoro) quinolones,
folate pathway inhibitors,
phenicols, penicillines, aminoglycosides and macrolides (Wong
et al., 2014; Yi et al., 2017). Resistance to polymyxin in
bacteria including Salmonella is commonly due to chromosomal
mutations in two component regulatory systems (e.g., pmrAB
and phoPQ)
lipid
A. Therefore, bacterial resistant to polymyxin was historically
thought
to be rare (Lee et al., 2014). However, recently,
a new plasmid-encoding polymyxin resistance gene, mcr-1,
was discovered from bacterial isolated from the environment,
animals, and humans in China (Liu et al., 2016). Subsequently,
occurrence of the mcr-1 gene has been reported worldwide,
indicating a newly recognized global distribution. Furthermore,
the mcr-1-bearing plasmids were found to possess the ability
to disseminate between food-producing animal and human
bacteria and were also highly stable in these backgrounds,
even in the absence of polymyxin selection (Anjum et al.,
2016; Kempf et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016; El Garch et al.,
2017).

The mcr-1 gene in Salmonella was originally detected
from human and food in England and Wales,
including 8
S. Typhimurium, 1 S. Paratyphi B var Java and 1 S. Virchow
strains (Doumith et al., 2016). Since then, this gene was reported

from Salmonella isolates in Europe, the United States, and China,
from humans, food-producing animals, and their surrounding
environment, and retail meat (Anjum et al., 2016; Campos et al.,
2016; Figueiredo et al., 2016; Quesada et al., 2016; Vinueza-
Burgos et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016). Nonetheless, to date, few
reports of the detection of mcr-1 have been cited in Salmonella
from ready-to-eat (RTE) pork meat in China. In this study, we
report for the ﬁrst time, the prevalence of Salmonella species
among RTE pork in China, and while one S. Typhimurium
isolate was then found to be positive for the mcr-1 gene, which
was located on a large transferable plasmid, along with multiple
antimicrobial resistance genes. The complete genome sequence
of both the plasmid and chromosome was determined to shed
insight into the diversity and complexity of this interesting
strain.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Strains Isolation
A total of 3,200 RTE pork samples were collected from 32
retail outlets and 32 commercial hypermarkets, in 32 provincial
capitals of China in 2014 (Figure 1). Fifty RTE pork samples
were collected at each sampling site and all were stored inside
tightly sealed aseptic bags, surrounded by a biological
ice
bag, and then placed in a box maintained at a temperature
lower than 4◦C. Samples were immediately transported to the
laboratory and subjected to microbiological analysis within
2 h. All samples were subjected to qualitative analysis for
Salmonella using an enrichment method described by the
National Food Safety Standard of China-Food microbiological
examination, Salmonella (GB 4789.4-2010). Finally, presumptive
Salmonella were selected for biochemical conﬁrmation using
API 20E test identiﬁcation test strips (bioMérieux, Marcy l(cid:48)
Etoile, France), as well as for molecular identiﬁcation using
PCR assay targeting the invA gene (Malorny et al., 2003).
For all of the conﬁrmed Salmonella isolates, serotypes were
determined by the slide agglutination test, using Salmonella
antisera (Statens Serum Institute, Denmark) according to
the Kauﬀmann–White scheme. All conﬁrmed Salmonella
isolates were stored in brain heart infusion broth with 40%
[v/v] glycerol (Land Bridge, Beijing, China) at −80◦C. Each
sample retained was represented by at
least one bacterial
isolate.

Detection of mcr-1 Gene

extraction kit (TianGen DNA Kit DP302, Beijing, China)
was used to extract
the genomic DNA from the culture
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A NanoDrop-2000
spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, NH, United States)
was then used to evaluate the quality of DNA. PCR was
performed to conﬁrm the presence of the mcr-1 gene among
the studied strains using primers targeting mcr-1 as reported
previously (Liu et al., 2016). The genetic identity of all amplicons
was subsequently conﬁrmed by nucleotide sequencing (Liu
et al., 2016). Finally, one S. Typhimurium isolate designated as
S. Typhimurium WW012 was determined to harbor the mcr-1
gene and this isolate was selected to perform the follow-up
experiments.

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests (AST)
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of the S. Typhimurium
WW012 isolate was performed using broth dilution method,
using the Biofosun R(cid:13) Gram-negative panel (Fosun Diagnostics,
Shanghai, China). Data obtained was interpreted according to
standards and guidelines described by Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute [CLSI] (2016). Additionally, we also used the
National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS)
protocol when CLSI standards were not available. The panel of
21 antimicrobial compounds as shown in Table 1 was tested
Reference Escherichia coli strain ATCCTM25922 was used as the
quality control.

Conjugal Plasmid Transfer and
Characterization
The mcr-1 harboring S. Typhimurium WW012 isolate was
analyzed for its ability to transfer the colistin resistance
phenotype using broth matting to the plasmid-free recipients,
E. coli J53. Transfer of mcr-1 to transconjugants was conﬁrmed
by PCR (Cui et al., 2017). Plasmid DNA proﬁles of both

Prevalence of mcr-1-Positive Salmonella
In this study, we collected and tested a total of 3,200 RTE
pork samples from 32 provincial capitals in China in 2014.
Thirty (30/3,200, 0.94%) samples were positive for Salmonella;
one isolate from each sample was selected for subsequent
analyses. In total, thirty isolates were recovered (comprising 10
serotypes), and the three most frequent serotypes among RTE
pork samples covering 66.7% of the total, were identiﬁed as
S. Derby (n = 8), S. Typhimurium (n = 6), and S. Enteritidis
(n = 6). One (1/30, 3.3%) S. Typhimurium isolate (designated
as S. Typhimurium WW012) was cultured from RTE prepared
pork collected from a convenience market in Nanning city,
Guangxi Province, and found to contain the mcr-1 gene.
The sampling details of isolates are shown in Supplementary
Table S1.

Susceptibility to Antimicrobial
Compounds
In this study, S. Typhimurium WW012 expressed a level of
high resistance to seven diﬀerent antimicrobial compounds in
addition to colistin (MIC = 8 mg/L) (Table 1). The isolate was
susceptible to all tested penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems,
and macrolides (Table 1). Moreover, S. Typhimurium WW012
was also found to be susceptible to enroﬂoxacin, whilst expressing
an intermediate resistant phenotype to ciproﬂoxacin (Table 1).

Horizontal Transfer of mcr-1 Genes and
Associated Determinants
One plasmid was identiﬁed from S. Typhimurium WW012
by S1-PFGE and the conjugation assay showed that it could
be transferred to a plasmid-free recipient E. coli J53 with a
conjugation frequency of 1.2 × 10−6 as determined under
laboratory conditions (Table 2 and Supplementary Figure S1).
MIC value of
the transconjugant were recorded at 8mg/L
using broth dilution test, which showed 64-fold increase in
when compared with the recipient E. coli J53 (0.125 mg/L).
This transconjugant expressed a MDR phenotype and was
found to be resistance to ﬁve antimicrobial compounds
including of
trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin,
tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and ﬂorfenicol, in addition to
colistin.

Genome Sequence Information
The S. Typhimurium WW012 genome consisted of a single
circular chromosome and a circular plasmid (Table 2 and
Supplementary Figure S2). The chromosome consisted of
4,991,167 bp with 4,684 predicted ORFs along with 110 RNAs.
Meanwhile, a single circular extra-chromosomal element was
identiﬁed and denoted as plasmid pWW012 of IncHI2 and
IncHI2A replicon types. The total size of plasmid pWW012 was
151,609 bp including 168 predicted ORFs with the average GC
content of 45.0% (Table 2). Moreover, the multilocus sequence
type (MLST) of S. Typhimurium WW012 was identiﬁed as ST34
(Table 2).

Acquired Antimicrobial
Resistance-Encoding Genes Identiﬁed in
the Bacterial Genome
The CARD database was queried to identify resistance related
genotypes on the genome of S. Typhimurium WW012. A total
of 21 antimicrobial resistance genes (two genes were identiﬁed
as aadA2) were identiﬁed, which encoded resistance to 11
antimicrobial agents of 10 diﬀerent classes, including 14 genes
on the chromosome and 7 on the plasmid (Table 2 and
Supplementary Figure S2). In detail, when compared with
S. Typhimurium LT2, one missense mutation in gyrA (D87N)
and a total of 24 missense mutations in the PmrAB and
PhoPQ systems were found within the chromosome of
S. Typhimurium WW012. Moreover, four and ﬁve additional
antimicrobial resistance genes of strA/B, sul2, tet(B) were also
found within the chromosome and plasmid, respectively, (Table 2
and Supplementary Figure S2).

S. Typhimurium WW012 possessed SPI-3, SPI-4, SPI-5, SPI-13,
SPI-14, and C63PI (Table 3) in addition to SPI-1 and SPI-2.
Moreover, 63 ﬁmbrial adherence-encoding genes and other

(Supplementary Figure S3A). The insertion
respectively,
element IS30 showed 100% (95% query coverage) of homologous
sequence with ISApl1 in plasmid pHNSHP45-2, where in 17
amino acids were missing at the 5(cid:48)-end comparing with the latter
(Supplementary Figure S3A). In addition to the mcr-1 gene
locus, plasmid pWW012 also contained an additional MDR gene
cassette embedded in a complex class 1 integron of 15.2-kbp
(Supplementary Figure S3B) bracketed by two IS26 elements
in but found in inverted orientations directions, at a distance
from the mcr-1 gene locus (Supplementary Figure S2). The
class 1 integron was preceded by a copy of insertion element
IS26, and two transposase-encoding genes tnpR and tnpM,
followed by the aadA2, cmlA1, and aadA1 genes. Downstream
of these resistance genes, an interesting resistance gene locus
consisting of IS406–sul3-orf -orf -orf -IS26 was identiﬁed. This
locus was followed by one integrase, two resistance genes of
dfrA12 and aadA2, and the IS26 element. This structure has also
been identiﬁed in two E. coli originated plasmids designated
as pHNLDF400 (KV019258.1) and pHNSHP45-2 (KU341381)
(Supplementary Figure S3B).

DISCUSSION

In the past, Salmonella has attracted much attention owing to its
important role as a food-borne pathogen. Recent studies reported
on the prevalence of Salmonella and plasmid-encoded polymyxin
resistance genes, containing mcr-1, among humans,
food-
producing animals and food samples in China and elsewhere
(Anjum et al., 2016; Campos et al., 2016; Doumith et al.,
2016; El Garch et al., 2016; Figueiredo et al., 2016; Kempf
et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016; Quesada et al., 2016; Yang et al.,
2016). However,
limited comprehensive epidemiological data

are available describing the prevalence of Salmonella and mcr-1
gene among RTE pork samples in China, although pork and
pork-related products are the main source of animal protein for
Chinese consumers. To the best of our knowledge, the current
study was the ﬁrst report on the epidemiological prevalence
and detection of Salmonella and mcr-1 gene among RTE pork
samples in China. Generally, the prevalence rate of Salmonella
and the mcr-1 gene among RTE pork samples was relatively low
in this study, while similar results were observed from clinical,
pigs and retail pork in previous studies (Figueiredo et al., 2016;
Quesada et al., 2016; Cui et al., 2017). However, considering the
fact that these RTE pork samples are positive for Salmonella
and therefore would not be heated or cooked the infectious
risk would increase. In China, only prepackaged RTE foodstuﬀs
have a pathogen limiting standard applied at National level. In
this study all RTE pork samples were collected from marketing
sites and nearly 87% of the samples that were positive for
Salmonella were unpackaged. Although these pork samples were
permitted for sale by the food hygiene bureau at the beginning,
unpacked treatment may later increase the probability of the
contamination of Salmonella during their shelf-life. Therefore,
limited standard and eﬀective legislation in RTE pork to prevent
and control the contamination of Salmonella should now be
considered.

In this study, we successfully recovered and characterized one
Salmonella isolate (S. Typhimurium WW012) that harbored a
mcr-1-bearing plasmid from a RTE prepared pork sample in
China. The genus Salmonella consists of a number of serovars,
where in it is reported that the most often detected serovar
harboring the mcr-1-was Typhimurium (Doumith et al., 2016;
Cui et al., 2017), suggesting that the acquisition and prevalence
of mcr-1-bearing mobile elements may require a speciﬁc genetic
background. The relationship between S. Typhimurium and
mcr-1-bearing plasmids warrants further investigation (Doumith
et al., 2016). This RTE pork isolate expressed a MDR phenotype
in addition to colistin. Notably, all of the resistant antimicrobial
agents tested in this study are widely used at human and
veterinary clinics. Carnevali et al. (2016) screened for the
mcr-1 gene in 4,473 Salmonella isolates from human, food-
producing animal, food and environment samples and identiﬁed
25 positive isolates of human and veterinary origin, all of
which were susceptible to broad-spectrum cephalosporins. The
S. Typhimurium WW012 isolate in this study was also susceptible
to all tested cephalosporin antimicrobials. Similar results were
reported from human, food-producing animals in China (Li et al.,
2016; Yi et al., 2017).

A laboratory-based conjugation assay revealed that the mcr-1
gene was transferrable to the plasmid-free recipient E. coli
J53, with a frequency of 1.2 × 10−6. In contrast, the transfer
frequency of the IncI2-type plasmid carrying the mcr-1 gene
reported in the original study was surprisingly higher, ranging
from 10−1 to 10−3 between E. coli strains (Liu et al., 2016).
In this study these data showed that
the
mcr-1 gene from S. Typhimurium WW012 to E. coli had
a frequency that was lower. Nonetheless,
it was conﬁrmed
that the mcr-1-carrying IncHI2-type plasmid in this study can
be transferred between diﬀerent genera of Enterobacteriaceae.

Characteristic of mcr-1 Harboring Salmonella

Of note, according to previous reports, the IncHI2 replicon
was one of the most common found in Salmonella (Campos
et al., 2016; Doumith et al., 2016). Moreover, several reports
conﬁrmed mcr-1-positive Salmonella that were expressing a
MDR phenotype (Doumith et al., 2016; Figueiredo et al., 2016;
Yang et al., 2016). Notably, the current data showed that this
transconjugant showed resistance to ﬁve antimicrobial agents in
addition to colistin, indicating that S. Typhimurium WW012
could not only transfer the mcr-1 gene but also other MDR-
encoding genes into other Enterobacteriaceae strains. Therefore,
once this clone carrying mcr-1 gene disseminates from RTE
pork to humans via the food chain,
it could be expected
to promote the forward dissemination of the latter marker
and other members of the Enterobacteriaceae. In this study
S. Typhimurium WW012 belonged to ST34, which is the
predominant sequence type in southern China (Sun et al.,
2014). Recently, the mcr-1 gene was also detected in MDR S.
Typhimurium (ST34) in China and Europe (Doumith et al., 2016;
Li et al., 2016).

In this study, the plasmid mediated colistin resistance gene
mcr-1 was found to be located in a composite transposon
with the structure IS30-mcr-1-orf -orf -IS30, which was similar
to those found previously on two E. coli plasmids pHYEC7-
mcr-1 (KX518745) and pHNSHP45-2 (KU341381), and one
C. braakii plasmid pSCC4 (CP021078, unpublished) (Liu et al.,
2016; Wang et al., 2018). Unlike plasmid pHNSHP45-2, the
original IncHI2-type mcr-1-carrying episome, the mcr-1 gene
located on plasmids pWW012, pHYEC7-mcr-1 and pSCC4
was bracketed by IS30 elements. According to a latest report,
ISApl1 is a member of the IS30 family of insertion sequences,
which utilize a ‘copy-out, paste-in’ mechanism with a targeted
transposition pathway requiring the formation of a synaptic
complex between an inverted repeat (IR) in the transposon
circle and an IR-like sequence in the target (Wang et al.,
2018). IS30 is related to site-speciﬁc recombination, which
could mediate the transmission of mcr-1 among diﬀerent
bacterial species. Moreover, it was found that several resistance
genes were also found to be present and located between
two IS26 elements on plasmid pWW012,
in which a class
1 integron similar to that found in plasmids pHNSHP45-2
and pHNLDF400 (KY019258.1) also existed (Liu et al., 2016;
Wang et al., 2017). The recovery of plasmid pWW012 that
harbored structurally similar mobile elements to these contained
in these reported plasmids implied that genetic exchange
between such plasmids was common, and that such plasmids
could readily be transferred to other bacteria, constituting one
major evolution and resistance development route for bacterial
pathogens.

In addition to the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene
mcr-1, genes found on chromosome containing mutations,
encoding two component regulatory systems (pmrAB, phoPQ),
were also found in this study. These chromosomal mutations
mediated mechanisms were thought to lead to the modiﬁcation
of lipid A, which anchors the lipopolysaccharide molecule to
the outer membrane, resulting in reduction in the aﬃnity to
colistin (Lee et al., 2014). Moreover, a target gene mutation
in the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) on

the chromosome were identiﬁed in gyrA mutation (giving rise
to D87N amino acid substitution) in this mcr-1 harboring
S. Typhimurium. The latter is frequently reported in other MDR
Salmonella species in China (Wong et al., 2014). In addition,
strA/B encoding streptomycin resistance and sul2 encoding
sulfamethoxazole resistances were also detected to locate on the
chromosome of S. Typhimurium WW012.

In this study, 201 virulence genes were found on the
chromosome of S. Typhimurium WW012 when queried through
VFDB. Type-three secretion systems (T3SS) encoding genes
related to SPI-1 and SPI-2 were commonly detected. Both SPI-
1 and SPI-2 contained two independent type three secretion
systems (denoted as TTSS SPI-1 and TTSS SPI-2, respectively)
that can inject eﬀect or proteins into host cells, which are crucial
for various stages of infection (Weening et al., 2005). Comparison
of the genomes S. Typhimurium WW012 with the reference or
complete sequences in NCBI for the presence of SPIs showed that
SPIs in S. Typhimurium WW012 were closely related to their
equivalents in S. Typhimurium LT2 (McClelland et al., 2001),
and shared some of those in S. Typhi CT18 and S. Indiana
C629 (Parkhill et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2016). Additionally,
63 ﬁmbrial adherence encoding genes on the chromosome of
S. Typhimurium WW012 were also identiﬁed in this study.
Several in vitro studies have suggested that ﬁmbrial-encoding
genes found in Salmonella could mediate the attachment of this
bacterium to epithelial cells in the host (Leclerc et al., 2016;
Peters et al., 2017). The latter phenotype may support long-term
intestinal carriage of this bacterium.

Heavy metal compounds as well as antimicrobial agents
are widely used as feed additives in food-producing animals
for therapy, and growth purposes in China (Hu et al., 2017).
Because of their stable and persistent characteristics, when heavy
metals accumulate to speciﬁc concentrations, they potentially
result in resistance among bacteria cultured from food-producing
animals. Heavy metal resistance-encoding genes have also been
identiﬁed in diﬀerent environments (Deng et al., 2017). Recent
research data showed that a relationship between the acquisition
of heavy metal resistance genes and antimicrobial resistance
genes, and antimicrobial resistance may arise through co-
resistance or cross-resistance to metals or co-regulation of
resistance pathways (Argudín et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2017).
In this study, 28 and 7 heavy metal resistance genes were
found on the chromosome and plasmid, respectively. These
heavy metal resistance genes might
increase antimicrobial
resistance capacity within this bacterium, through co-selection of
determinants.

CONCLUSION

This study ﬁrstly reported the epidemiological prevalence and
detection of Salmonella and mcr-1 gene among RTE pork samples
in China. These data highlight the importance of role played by
S. Typhimurium in the dissemination of MDR genes. Although
the mechanisms remain to be further described, the emergence
of MDR genes particularly mcr-1, along with various virulence
factors and heavy metal resistance genes, on the chromosome and

protection of public health.
