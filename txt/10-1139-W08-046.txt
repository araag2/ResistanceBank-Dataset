Abstract: The presence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains in feces samples of cattle was determined
using the cytotoxicity assay on Vero cells and a screening PCR system to detect stx genes. The STEC isolates were sero-
typed, tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, and analyzed for virulence genes using multiplex PCR. The verocytotoxin-
producing E. coli – reverse passive latex agglutination (VTEC–RPLA) assay was also used to detect Shiga toxin production.
The frequency of cattle shedding STEC was 36%. The isolates belonged to 33 different serotypes, of which O10:H42,
O98:H41, and O159:H21 had not previously been associated with STEC. The most frequent serotypes were ONT:H7 (10%),
O22:H8 (7%), O22:H16 (7%), and ONT:H21 (7%). Most of the strains (96%) were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents
tested. Shiga toxin was detected by the VTEC–RPLA assay in most (89%) of the STEC strains. The frequency of virulence
markers was as follows: stx1, 10%; stx2, 43%; stx1 plus stx2, 47%; ehxA, 44%; eae, 1%; and saa, 38%. Several strains belong
to serotypes associated with human disease, and most of them carried a stx2-type gene, suggesting that they represent a risk
to human health. The screening PCR assay showed fewer false-negative results for STEC than the Vero-cell assay and is
suitable for laboratory routine.

______________________________________________________________________________________

Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains are
an important cause of food-borne disease, representing a
serious problem to public health in several countries. These
organisms are associated with sporadic cases and outbreaks
of diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and hemolytic uremic syn-
drome (WHO/CSR/APH 1998; Mainil and Daube 2005).
More than 400 serotypes of STEC have been described, and
over 150 implicated in human disease (WHO/CSR/APH
1998; Zweifel et al. 2005). The main virulence factor of
STEC is the Shiga toxin (Stx) of which 2 major types, Stx1
and Stx2, exist; variant forms have also been described. In
addition to Stx, STEC may also carry genes such as eae,
which is encoded in the pathogenicity island LEE (locus of
enterocyte effacement), coding for
the adhesin intimin,
which mediates the production of attaching and effacing le-
sions on intestinal mucosa; and ehxA that codes for entero-
hemolysin (Mainil and Daube 2005). The Saa protein
(STEC auto agglutinating adhesin), coded by the saa gene,
is also a putative virulence factor in LEE-negative strains
(Paton et al. 2001).

Since STEC strains have biochemical properties similar to
those of E. coli from normal enteric flora the detection of
Shiga toxins, using the cytotoxicity assay in Vero cells or
immunological tests, or the presence of genes coding for
these toxins are alternatives to identify such strains (Karch
et al. 1999; Bettelheim and Beutin 2003).

Cattle are the major reservoir of STEC, and the fecal con-
tamination of meat during slaughter is the main route by
which these pathogens enter the food supply (Meng and
Doyle 1998). The dispersion of manure in the environment
and its use as fertilizer can also be a source of food contam-
ination (Caprioli et al. 2005). Few epidemiologic studies on
the occurrence of STEC have been conducted in Brazil, and
most of these report isolates from the Sa˜o Paulo and Rio de
Janeiro states (Cerqueira et al. 1999; Leomil et al. 2003;
Irino et al. 2005). Parana´ State has a cattle herd composed
of approximately 10 million animals (www.agricultura.gov.
br), while the herd of the whole of the South region consti-
tutes about 15% (30 million animals) of the Brazilian herd,
most of which have been raised in an extensive grazing sys-
tem, based on free-range pasture.

In this work, the presence of STEC in beef cattle from
Parana´ State of southern Brazil was determined using a
PCR screening system and the cytotoxicity assay in Vero
cells. STEC strains were differentiated by serotype; antimi-
crobial susceptibility; stx typing; and the presence of eae,
ehxA, and saa genes. Three serotypes (O10:H42, O98:H41,
and O159:H21), out of 33 found in the cattle samples, were
not previously associated with production of Shiga toxin and

may represent a yet unidentified potential hazard for human
health.

Swabs of rectal feces from 190 healthy cattle (140 adults
and 50 calves less than 2 months old), extensively grazed,
from 43 different localities of Parana´ State, were collected
from slaughterhouses from December 2002 to November
2003. Samples from up to 5 randomly chosen animals from
each location were collected. Swabs containing the fecal
samples were transported in Cary–Blair medium and within
6 h were cultured on sorbitol–MacConkey agar. For each
sample, up to 10 colonies, including sorbitol-negative and
sorbitol-positive colonies, were selected and identified using
the following biochemical tests: acid from glucose, gas from
glucose, H2S, urease, L-tryptophane deaminase,
indole,
lysine decarboxylase, and motility. Those confirmed as
E. coli were tested for Shiga toxin production using the
cytotoxicity assay in Vero cells (Gentry and Dalrymple
1980) and for
the presence of stx genes by using a
screening PCR protocol (Lin et al. 1993) with primers
LinF (5’ GAACGAAATAATTTATATGT 3’) and LinR
(5’ TTTGATTGTTAC(A/C)GTCAT 3’). DNA was ex-
tracted by the boiling method (Olsvik and Strockbine
1993). A multiplex PCR protocol was used to detect the
stx1, stx2, eae, ehxA, and saa genes (Paton and Paton
2002);
this assay was used twice for each strain. For
strains in which doubt persisted, PCR with a single pri-
mer pair was used. STEC O157:H7 (EDL 933) and
E. coli ATCC 25922 were used as positive and negative
controls, respectively. In addition, the VTEC–RPLA Seiken
(Denka Seiken Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was performed ac-
cording to the manufacturer’s instructions, to a maximum
extract dilution of 1:16. Titres higher than 1:4 were consid-
ered positive for Shiga toxin.

Of 190 stool samples analyzed, 69 (36%) were positive
for STEC that were found only in adult cattle. Most of the
strains were sorbitol positive (Table 1). Samples from 3 ani-
mals had 2 different STEC strains isolated with distinct sor-
bitol reactions, belonging to different serotypes and carrying
distinct sets of virulence markers, producing a total of 72
STEC strains. Animals shedding STEC were found in 27
(63%) of the 43 localities. There was a clear difference in
STEC frequency according to the period of collection—
summer having the highest frequency (56%) and winter the
lowest
frequency of STEC during
summer was also described in other studies (Karch et al.
1999). The overall frequency (36%) was similar to that
found in Rio de Janeiro (Cerqueira et al. 1999) but higher
in Sa˜o Paulo (Leomil et al. 2003; Irino et al.
than that
2005), both in the southeast of Brazil. Studies conducted in

(26%). The highest

states from southern Brazil reported STEC frequencies of
49% and 39% in Rio Grande do Sul (Moreira et al. 2003;
Timm et al. 2007) and 59% in Parana´ (Farah et al. 2007).
The higher frequency of STEC in cattle of Parana State re-
lated by Farah and co-workers could be associated with the
period, early autumn, and localities in which the samples
were collected. Our studies indicate that there is seasonal
variation in the frequency of STEC recovery from cattle,
and further work will be necessary to clarify the reasons.
Considering that in the present work samples were collected
for 1 year, these results could reflect a better estimate of
STEC occurrence. It was also observed that the distribution
of cattle shedding STEC was not uniform in the different re-
gions of the State—the highest frequencies (68%) were
found in cities of the northwest, the lowest (18%) in the
southeast. This should be related to differences in the cli-
mate and (or) management of the cattle.

STEC strains were serotyped using O (O1 to O181) and H
(H1 to H56) antisera prepared at the Adolfo Lutz Institute,
Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil. The strains were classified into 33 distinct
groups according to the serotyping reactions (Table 1), of
which, O10:H42, O98:H41, and O159:H21 had not previ-
ously been associated with STEC. Except for serotypes
O79:H–, O110:H2, O117:H8, O124:H11, O181:H4,
ONT:H38, and OR:H10, and those not previously associated
with STEC, all other serotypes have been associated with
human infection (Prager et al. 2005; http://www.
microbionet.com.au/vtectable.htm; http://www.lugo.usc.es/
ecoli/SEROTIPOSHUM.htm). The most frequent serotypes
were ONT:H7 (10%), O22:H8 (7%), O22:H16 (7%), and
ONT:H21 (7%). Strains ONT:H7 and O22:H8 were also pre-
dominant in the studies by Farah et al. (2007) and Timm et
al. (2007) in cattle from the Parana´ and Rio Grande do Sul
states but not in other states in Brazil; on the other hand,
serotype O22:H16 was found to be among the most common
serotype isolated in the Rio de Janeiro and Sa˜o Paulo states
(Cerqueira et al. 1999; Aidar-Ugrinovich et al. 2007). This
suggests that different serotypes may prevail
in different
geographic regions of this country. The finding that serotype
O111 is the most frequently isolated from human infections
(Vaz et al. 2004) and cattle from Sa˜o Paulo State (Irino et

this

al. 2005; Aidar-Ugrinovich et al. 2007), though it was not
found in cattle from other states (Cerqueira et al. 1999;
Moreira et al. 2003; Farah et al. 2007; Timm et al. 2007),
supports
suggestion. Serotypes ONT:H7, O22:H8,
O22:H16, and ONT:H21 were already associated with hu-
man disease (http://www.microbionet.com.au/vtectable.htm,
http://www.lugo.usc.es/ecoli/SEROTIPOSHUM.htm); how-
ever,
to our knowledge, human infection in Brazil asso-
ciated with these serotypes was not reported, although they
are commonly found in cattle from this country. One possi-
bility is that the strains prevalent in Brazil have a low level
of virulence.

the

strains

The susceptibility pattern of the STEC strains was deter-
mined by the disk diffusion method (National Committee
for Clinical Laboratory Standards 2000), using the following
antimicrobials:
ampicillin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol,
ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, nalidixic acid, nitro-
furantoin,
tetracycline, and trimethoprim–
streptomycin,
sulfamethoxazole. Most
(96%) were
of
susceptible to all antimicrobials tested (Table 1). Three
strains showed an intermediate response to tetracycline.
None of the strains were resistant to any of the antimicro-
bials tested, which is in contrast to the resistance level found
in STEC isolated from cattle in other countries (Maidhof et
al. 2002; Schroeder et al. 2002; Mora et al. 2005). However,
a high frequency of susceptibility was also found in STEC
strains isolated from cattle from Sa˜o Paulo State, and among
the strains that showed resistance to antimicrobials, all of
them were resistant to tetracycline (Cergole-Novella et al.
2006). The low level of resistance found may be associated
with the fact that the most common cattle management sys-
tem is free roaming on grassland, and food supplement con-
taining antibiotics is not a common practice (www.seab.pr.
gov.br) possibly due to its high cost in this country.

The virulence markers were found in 11 different combi-
nations (Table 1), the most frequent being stx2 (27%) and
then stx1 stx2 and stx1 stx2 ehxA saa (16% each). The high
frequency of the stx2 gene (89%) suggests a potential hazard
for human health, since stx2 is related to higher virulence
(Boerlin et al. 1999; Beutin et al. 2004). The eae gene was
found in only one strain and in association with stx1 and

ehxA. The presence of stx2 plus eae is associated with a
more severe form of the human disease (Boerlin et al.
1999; Beutin et al. 2004). Although certain serotypes of
STEC lacking the eae gene may also cause severe disease,
this result suggests that the low prevalence of the stx2 eae
genotype may be related to the rare occurrence of hemolytic
uremic syndrome in Brazil (Guth et al. 2002). The saa gene
was found only in 28 (38%) strains, so other types of adhe-
sins may be involved in the adhesion mechanisms of these
strains. The ehxA gene was found in 32 (44%) strains, 22 of
which tested positive for the saa gene, indicating a signifi-
cant association between these genes of plasmid origin
(Paton et al. 2001).

Some of the strains belonging to the same serotype car-
ried different complements of virulence genes (Table 1), in-
dicating genetic and biochemical diversity of the isolates
which may differ in the ability to cause disease. Thus sero-
typing is not enough to define virulence and virulence genes
should be identified in the epidemiologic surveys to better
evaluate the risk that STEC strains represent
to human
health.

Divergent results between the cytotoxicity assay in Vero
cells and the PCR screening assay for stx genes were ob-
served in 3 strains (Table 1). The multiplex PCR assay re-
vealed that 2 of these strains contained copies of stx1 plus
stx2, but by the cytotoxicity assay they were false negatives,
although Stx expression was detected by the VTEC–RPLA
assay (Table 1). Only one false negative in the PCR screen-
ing was latter shown to have the stx1 gene by multiplex
PCR, and a weak reaction for Stx1 was observed in the im-
munoassay. This suggests the presence of a stx1 allele not
recognized by the primers used in the screening PCR.
Although there was no significant difference when the re-
sults of the Vero cell and PCR screening assays were com-
pared by the c2 test (c2 = 0.04, P = 0.83), the latter offers
clear advantages for routine use, since it is easier to per-
form,
less expensive, and allows faster detection of stx-
containing bacteria.

Sixty-five strains (90%) reacted positively in the VTEC–
RPLA assay. Three of the strains identified as producing
Stx1 by the VTEC–RPLA assay were found to contain stx1
plus stx2 genes by the multiplex PCR. The 7 STEC strains
for which the VTEC–RPLA assay was negative (Table 1)
were shown to carry stx1 plus stx2, stx2, or stx1; all these
strains were positive in the Vero cell assay, indicating that
they produce active Shiga toxin and that the negative result
observed in the VTEC–RPLA is probably due to a Stx var-
iant not recognized by the antibodies used in the assay or to
a low level of expression. Negative results for strains har-
boring variants of stx2 were already observed for VTEC–
RPLA assay (Beutin et al. 2004), and substantial differences
in the amount of Stx produced by strains with various stx
alleles were found by Orth et al. (2007).

In conclusion, this work showed the presence of serotypes
of STEC associated with human disease in cattle from Par-
ana´ State. All strains belonged to non-O157 serogroups,
which may explain the prevalence of non-O157 serogroups
in human infections by STEC in Brazil (Vaz et al. 2004;
Cergole-Novella et al. 2006), and most of them were suscep-
tible to all the antimicrobials tested. Although most of the
strains presented a stx2-type gene, they may be less virulent,

since they do not contain the eae gene. The low level of vir-
ulence of these strains could explain why, in Brazil, STEC
are associated with uncomplicated diarrhea, and why cases
of severe disease such as hemorrhagic colite and hemolytic
uremic syndrome are so rare. However, lateral transfer of
virulence genes may give rise to new STEC strains with un-
predictable behavior. Thus, although some of these strains
have not been associated with severe disease in humans,
they can represent a potential hazard for human health.
