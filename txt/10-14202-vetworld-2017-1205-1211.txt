Abstract

Aim:  The  aim  of  our  study  was  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  detection  of  the  genes  responsible  for  the  multiple 
antibiotic resistance S. aureus isolated from food of animal origin in Egypt.
Materials  and  Methods:  A  total  of  125  samples  were  randomly  collected  from  milk,  meat,  and  their  products  from 
Giza and Beni-Suef Governorates markets. The S. aureus isolates were subjected to antimicrobial sensitivity tests using 
four antibacterial disks (Oxoid), and then the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for detection of antibiotic 
resistance genes.
Results: Out of 125 samples, 19 S. aureus isolates were detected. All detected isolates were multiple drug resistance (MDR). 
The penicillin-, erythromycin-, kanamycin-, and tetracycline-resistant isolates were examined by PCR for resistance genes 
blaZ, (msrA, ermB, and ermC), aac(6’)aph (2’’), and tetK. The isolates harbored these resistance genes with percentage of 
100% (100%, 0%, and 100%), 62.5%, and 100%, respectively.
Conclusion: Contaminated foods of animal origin may represent a source of MDR S. aureus that can be a major threat to 
public health.

Introduction

The development of multiple antibiotic-resistant 
bacteria due to misuse of antibiotics in animals and 
poultry  production  is  well  authenticated  for  patho-
genic bacteria [1,2]. Contaminated food of animal ori-
gins with antibiotic-resistant bacteria can be a great 
threat  to  public  health,  and  the  antibiotic  resistance 
determinants can be transferred from antibiotic-resis-
tant bacteria to other bacteria affecting human [3,4]. 
Identical elements of antibiotic-resistant genes found 
in bacteria that affect both animals and humans have 
shown the role of raw foods in the dissemination of 
these resistance genes through the food chains [5,6] or 
through occupational contact with livestock [7].

The  multiple  antibiotic-resistant  bacteria  were 
commonly isolated from food of animal origin such 
as  raw  milk  and  unpasteurized  dairy  products  [2,8] 
and  meat  products  [9],  the  resistance  genes  can  be 
transferred  from  antibiotic-resistant  bacteria  to  the

intestinal flora of humans through food products, and 
the  commensally  flora  can  be  a  reservoir  of  resis-
tant  genes  for  pathogenic  bacteria  [10].  The  high 
prevalence  of  multidrug-resistant  Staphylococcus 
aureus was discovered from food of animal origin in 
Europe, Canada, and United States in multiple stud-
ies [11,12], which represents a huge problem in public 
health [13,14].

The aim of our study was polymerase chain reac-
tion (PCR) detection of the genes responsible for the 
multiple antibiotic resistance S. aureus isolated from 
food of animal origin in Egypt.

Ethical approval

No  animals  were  involved  in  the  study  at  any 

stage.
Samples

A total of 125 samples were collected from meat, 
milk,  and  their  products  from  Giza  and  Beni-Suef 
Governorates markets (Table-1), and all samples were 
aseptically  collected  and  examined  for  detection  of 
S. aureus.
Identification and characterization of S. aureus

One  loopful  from  prepared  incubated  samples 
was  plated  onto  nutrient  agar  (Difco)  and  mannitol 
1205

examined  for  bacterial  growth.  The  suspected  colo-
nies  were  identified  morphologically  and  biochemi-
cally [15].
Antimicrobial sensitivity test for identified strains

The  antimicrobial  sensitivity  tests  were  done 
by  disk  diffusion  technique  [16]  using  4  antibac-
terial  disks  (kanamycin,  penicillin,  erythromycin, 
and tetracycline) - Oxoid - the degree of sensitivity 
was  interpreted  according  to  Koneman  et  al.,  and 
CLSI [17,18].
PCR detection of the resistance genes

PCR was performed for detection of resistance 
genes  in  biotechnology  center  in  the  animal  health 
institute according to Sambrook and Russel [19]. The 
primers  were  synthesized  by  Metabion  Company, 
Germany, as mentioned in Table-2.

Discussion

The livestock products could be a source of expo-
sure to multidrug-resistant S. aureus strains as a result 
of hazardous misuse of antibiotics in animal treatment 
and unhygienic livestock practices [2]. Food of animal 
origin is an ideal culture medium for growth of many 
organisms  [22]. They  are  considered  as  a  shelter  of 
different types of microorganisms through processing, 
handling, preparation, and storage as well as distribu-
tion  [23].  They  are  considered  as  major  sources  of 
foodborne  diseases  and  have  been  linked  to  serious 
outbreaks of food poisoning worldwide.

The  result  showed  in  Table-3  reported  that 
S. aureus isolated from raw milk and milk products 
(Kareish  cheese  and  yoghurt),  and  from  meat  and 
meat  products  (burger  and  luncheon)  were  13.8% 
and 16.6%, respectively. A higher recovery rate was 
obtained by El-Jakee et al. [24], they isolated S. aureus 
from cow milk (22.7%) and buffalo milk (16%), and 
on the other hand, El-Jakee et al. [25] revealed that raw 
milk contaminated with S. aureus with an incidence 
of 56%. While Jamali et al. [26] reported S. aureus 
with  a  percentage  of  15.7%  and  12.4%  from  dairy 
products and raw milk, respectively, Imani et al. [27] 
found 4% of milk and 32% of dairy products contam-
inated  with  S.  aureus,  similar  results  were  obtained 
by Song et al. [28], who isolated S. aureus from raw 
milk  with  a  percentage  of  20.2%.  Higher  results  of 
S.  aureus  contamination  were  reported  in  raw  milk 
by Gwida and El-Gohary [29]. They recorded 56.66% 
of S. aureus present in market milk. The prevalence 
of S. aureus in Kareish cheese in our results is lower 
than the result reported by Hosny et al. [30], who iso-
lated S. aureus with a percentage of 17% from milk 
shops  and  street  vend  but  reported  the  same  result 
from brand cheese. The presence of S. aureus in milk 
was variable in different regions, and these variations 
may be due to season, number of animals on the farm, 
farm size, hygiene status, variation in sampling, farm 
management practices, geographical location, and dif-
ferences in detection methods and variation in types 
of  samples  evaluated.  El-Sayed  et  al.  [31]  revealed 
that in Egypt the difference in white soft cheese due 
to  acidity  as  Domiati  or  Kareish  acid  coagulation, 
enzyme coagulation, keeping temperatures, different 
salt concentrations, and ripening in brine solutions are 
factors affecting the microbiological quality of these 
varieties.

The incidence of S. aureus in meat products in 
our  study  agrees  with  the  findings  of  the  study  by 
Fox et al. [32], who tested 124 raw meat samples for 
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) including pig 
(n=63),  poultry  (n=50),  and  turkey  (n=11)  collected

was isolated from 9 (73%) samples (4 poultry, 3 pig, 
and 2 turkeys) from different butchers and supermar-
kets. While  Pesavento  et  al.  [33]  isolated  S.  aureus 
from raw meat 23.86%. Another study by Ge et al. [34] 
detected S. aureus from retail meats of turkey, pork, 
beef,  and  chickens.  While  Ali  et  al.  [35]  isolated 
S.  aureus  from  meat  samples  with  a  percentage  of 
7%. Hassanin [36] isolated S. aureus from burger and 
luncheons agreed with our results with a percentage 
of 25% and 47.5%, respectively, but differ in minced 
meat (65%). S. aureus was isolated from meat prod-
ucts with a percentage of 30% by Abdaslam et al. [37]. 
While Li et al. [38] were recorded 27.9% of S. aureus 
isolates from food sample. Another study recovered 
S. aureus in 27 from 165 retail meat samples with a 
percentage of  16.4%  [39].  On  the  other  hand,  Song 
et al. [28] isolated S. aureus 21.3% from frozen food 
and 28.1% from raw meat samples.

Transmission  of  antibiotic-resistant  S.  aureus 
strains  can  be  done  by  contaminated  foods  with 
resistant  bacteria  [40].  Some  researchers  reported  a 
primary relationship between the prevalence of antibi-
otic-resistant bacteria and the misusing of antibiotics 
for therapeutic purposes in animals [41].

The  result  of  our  S.  aureus  sensitivity  test 
(Table-4)  revealed  that  14  out  of  19  identified 
S. aureus isolates were resistant to penicillin (73.6%), 
while  11  isolates  exhibited  resistance  against  tet-
racycline  (57.8%),  5  isolates  were  resistant  to

erythromycin  (26.3%),  and  8  isolates  were  resistant 
to  kanamycin  (42.1%). All  the  isolates  were  multi-
drug  resistance  (MDR)  because  they  were  resistant 
for more than one antibiotic class. The same results 
were found by Ammar et al. [42], and they observed 
MDR  S.  aureus  (MDRSA)  among  85%  of  isolates 
recovered from examined milk and meat product sam-
ples. Approximately  10.4%  from  S.  aureus  detected 
in retail meats in 1-year survey (2010-2011) collected 
from eight U.S. states were MDRSA Ge et al. [34]. 
While  Jamali  et  al.  [26]  stated  that  36.3%,  46.6%, 
and 12.8% of isolates were resistant to one, two, and 
more than two antimicrobial agents, respectively, and 
found  that  S.  aureus  resistant  to  tetracycline  with  a 
percentage  of  56.1%,  chloramphenicol  (3.7%),  and 
gentamicin (2.1%) but low incidence in case of eryth-
romycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, penicillin G, and 
oxacillin. Our study agreed with many reports indicat-
ing a high percentage of multidrug-resistant S. aureus 
isolates  from  food  of  animal  origin  [32,43-45]. The 
same results obtained by Argudín et al. [46], and they 
found that S. aureus resistant to oxacillin (95%) and 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  (4%)  but  differed  in 
erythromycin (70%), tetracycline (100%), kanamycin 
(29%), and gentamicin (14%) and also reported that 
4%, 30%, 21%, and 33% of S. aureus isolates were 
resistant to more than four, three, and five classes of 
antibiotics, respectively. Tan et al. [47] disagreed with 
our results, and they stated that 94.59% of the strains 
were resistant only to one of the antibiotics or did not 
resistant  to  all  of  the  tested  antibiotics,  while  only 
5.41% of S. aureus strains were multidrug resistant, 
while Teramoto et al. [48] found that S. aureus iso-
lates from conventional retail meat were resistant to 
both erythromycin 50.0% and tetracycline 58.3%.

PCR-based molecular methods are preferred for 
determination of antibiotic-resistant genes. Recently, 
many studies have demonstrated the extremely high 
capacity  of  molecular  methods  such  as  PCR  and 
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis; these methods were 
increasingly used for their specific, rapid, reliable, and 
accurate detection of bacteria and genes of interest [49]. 
Nowadays, the detection of antibiotic-resistant genes 
was  accomplished  by  PCR  methods  directed  to  the 
linA,  tetK,  msrA,  msrB,  ermA,  ermC,  aacA-D,  and

used to survey clinically relevant antibiotic resistance 
genes frequently encountered in S. aureus.

The  results  revealed  that  all  tested  isolates  of 
S.  aureus  which  were  resistant  to  penicillin  carried 
blaZ genes, the erythromycin-resistant isolates carried 
ermB, msrA, and ermC with a percentage of 0%, 100%, 
and  100%,  respectively,  and  aminoglycoside  gene 
aac(6’)  aph  (2’’)  (kanamycin  resistance  gene)  pres-
ent in a percentage of 62.5% in the resistant isolates 
while  the  tetracycline-resistant  isolates  carried  tetK 
gene with a percentage of 100%. Our findings agreed 
with McCallum et al. and Argudín et al. [46,51], they 
reported that tetK gene was present in a percentage of 
91% of tetracycline resistant, 70% of erythromycin-re-
sistant isolates carried resistance genes (encoded by 
ermC, ermA, and ermB, alone or in combination), and 
aac(6’)aph  (2’’)  gene  found  in  kanamycin-resistant 
gene,  while  penicillin-resistant  isolates  carried  blaZ 
gene 94%. While Jamali et al. [26] found that blaZ 
(97.4%) and tetK (41.8%) present in penicillin- and 
tetracycline-resistant isolates, respectively, and msrA 
and ermC genes (erythromycin resistance gene) pres-
ent in high prevalence as our results but with differ-
ent prevalence of ermB gene. The high prevalence of 
the blaZ and tet M resistance genes in this study is in 
agreement with the results reported by Gao et al. [52]. 
The  same  findings  were  obtained  by  Li  et  al.  [38], 
on msrA, ermC, tetK, and blaZ genes with different 
results for ermB. Duran et al. [20] reported erythromy-
cin resistance genes (ermA, ermB, ermC, and msrA), 
one of them at least was present in erythromycin-re-
sistant isolates, tetM or tetK or both resistance genes 
isolates were found in tetracycline-resistant isolates, 
aac(6’)aph(2’’)  presents  in  gentamicin  susceptible 
S. aureus isolates, and major of staphylococci tested 
possessed the blaZ gene (89.9%). Argudín et al. [46] 
reported that all strains resistant to ampicillin–penicil-
lin carried the blaZ gene, and they detected the genes 
responsible for erythromycin resistance together with 
inducible  resistance  to  clindamycin  were  ermA  and 
ermC while resistance to erythromycin only was asso-
ciated with the presence of either msrB or msrB msrA. 
A high prevalence of ermB gene than ermC in food of 
animal origin was detected by Martineau et al. [53].
Conclusion

Foods of animal origin may represent a source 
of MDR S. aureus that can be a major threat to public 
health infection for humans.
