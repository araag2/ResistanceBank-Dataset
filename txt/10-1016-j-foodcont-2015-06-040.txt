This study surveyed the distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility proÔ¨Åles and serotype of Salmonella
isolated from three slaughterhouses, and performed molecular typing on these isolates, to understand
the relationship between strains of Salmonella obtained from the pork production chain in Yangzhou,
China. Samples from slaughtered pigs and the slaughtering environment were collected from three
slaughterhouses in Yangzhou, Jiangsu province, from October 2012 to July 2013. The positive identiÔ¨Å-
cation rates of Salmonella in slaughtered pigs and the environmental samples were 46.6% and 48.8%,
respectively. The prevalence of Salmonella in slaughterhouses were affected by seasonal factors and
reached the peak in summer. Among the Salmonella serovars identiÔ¨Åed, S. Derby was most prevalent in
slaughterhouses, but other serovars like S. Typhimurium, S. Meleagridis and S. Anatum were also
widespread. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that 32 and 131 different MDR patterns were
found among the strains from the environment and slaughtered pig samples, respectively. Fifty-six
isolates of S. Derby and 16 strains of S. Typhimurium were characterized by the technique of pulsed-
Ô¨Åeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using the restriction enzyme Xba I. 35 and 11 PFGE patterns were
generated among the selected isolates. Four isolates of S. Derby isolates with the same pattern (PF26)
were isolated from cooling water, evisceration and carcass, suggesting that cross contamination occurred
between the environment and the slaughtered pigs. Six S. Typhimurium in cluster 1 with the same ST
type (ST19) came from different parts of the slaughtered pig, which could have occurred because of
horizontal transmissions along the slaughtering process. The same PFGE patterns of Salmonella were
found in both samples from carcasses in the slaughterhouse and in the Yangzhou pork market, proving
that Salmonella had spread from the slaughterhouse to the pork market. In conclusion, our study
demonstrate that serious cross contamination occurred in Yangzhou slaughterhouses and can contribute
Salmonella contamination in pork sold in the local public market.

1. Introduction

Salmonella is recognized as a major human food-borne pathogen
and can cause a heavy economic burden for health care systems
worldwide. Animals used as food play a role as a primary reservoir
of non-typhoid Salmonella, and most human Salmonella infections
are a consequence of eating foods of animal origin contaminated
with Salmonella (EFSA, 2011). Contaminated pork and pork

products are major sources of human Salmonella infections in many
countries (Bonardi et al., 2013; De Busser et al., 2011; Delhalle et al.,
2009).

Research has shown that Salmonella transmission may occur
throughout the pork production chain (Lo Fo Wong et al., 2004),
and many opportunities exist within the pig slaughterhouse for the
contamination of pork carcasses with Salmonella. Based on an EFSA
report (EFSA, 2011), the prevalence of Salmonella-positive swine-
breeding holdings and swine-production holdings in the Euro-
pean Union was 28.7% and 33.3%, respectively, indicated a serious
contamination in pig farms. The prevalence of shedding pigs may
increase from farm to abattoir, mainly because of the stress of
transportation, consequently increasing interinfection of pigs

during lairage. Salmonella is spread to the carcass surface mainly
from the carrier pig during the evisceration and slaughter opera-
tions can inÔ¨Çuence the bacterial contamination of pork carcasses in
many ways, therefore, proper slaughter operation and good hy-
gienic practices in the slaughterhouse can have a positive effect on
the elimination of contamination in carcasses (Bonardi et al., 2003;
De Busser et al., 2011). Slaughterhouses vary in their capability of
dealing with Salmonella-positive pigs. Proper cleaning and control
measures can reduce the risk of carcass contamination in slaugh-
terhouses. In this sense, identifying the serotype and genotype of
Salmonella isolates throughout the pig production chain were
necessary to determine the cross-contamination and explore the
relationship of the strains isolated from the environment and the
pig carcass.

Salmonella enterica serotypes Derby and Typhimurium were the
two most commonly detected serotypes in carcasses and in both
clinical and nonclinical veterinary swine samples (Foley, Lynne, &
Nayak, 2008). S. Typhimurium was also the most frequently iso-
lated serotype from all human invasive infections reported. Similar
results were reported by EFSA, where the most frequently reported
serovars in human salmonellosis were in agreement with those
isolated in slaughter pigs (EFSA, 2011). These Ô¨Åndings support the
notion that pigs and pork contribute to Salmonella infection in
humans, although it is acknowledged that foods from other animal
species also play a role as a source of these infections in humans
(Hugas et al., 2014).

China is the largest producer of pork with the fastest growth rate
in the world and this growth will continue in 2014: swine pro-
duction is expected to reach 723 million head, pork production is
expected to increase by two percent to 54.7 million tons, and
consumption expected to rise to 55 million tons (Schneider et al.,
2014). However, few reports have been published on Salmonella
contamination throughout the slaughter process in China. There-
fore, the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and
antimicrobial resistance patterns of Salmonella contamination
along the slaughter line through the detection of Salmonella in
slaughtered pigs and their slaughterhouse environmental samples.
Furthermore, sero- and genotyping were performed to deÔ¨Åne
clonal relationships between isolates, assessing the dispersion of
recovered strains and their involvement in cross contamination.
Some of the strains isolated from pork in our previous study were
also involved in our analysis to reveal the correlation between these
two studies.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Slaughterhouse description and sample plan

The study was carried out from October 2012 to July 2013 in
three slaughterhouses (A, B and C) in Yangzhou, which were
distributed in different areas of Yangzhou and represented 80% of
the annual number of pigs slaughtered in Yangzhou. Table 1 de-
scribes the situations of the three slaughterhouses. Each visit was
performed on a Tuesday during the nine sampling visits: V1
(slaughterhouse A, December 2012; slaughterhouse B, November
2012; slaughterhouse C, October 2012), V2 (slaughterhouse A, April

Table 1
Description of the three slaughterhouses included in the study.

2013; slaughterhouse B, March 2013; slaughterhouse C, February
2013), V3 (slaughterhouse A, July 2013; slaughterhouse B, June
2013; slaughterhouse C, May 2013) and sampling started with the
Ô¨Årst batch of pigs slaughtered that day.

2.2. Slaughterhouse samples

A total of 684 samples were collected from the three slaugh-
terhouses, of which 522 were slaughtered pig samples and 162
were slaughterhouse environmental samples. The description of
the number and type of samples are shown in Table 2.

2.2.1. Slaughtered pig samples

From each chosen slaughtered pig, samples were collected as

follows:

Mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs): At least 5 lymph nodes in the
ileocaecal regions were cut out of the intestine packet with a sterile,
disposable scalpel.

Carcass swabs: Carcass swabs were selected at three high-risk
cross-contamination points along the slaughter line (submitting,
evisceration, and after washing carcass). Carcasses were swabbed
on the external and internal surfaces at four different points: cheek,
ham (right and left), rib cage and neck-upper-shoulder. Sampling
was done using a sterile moistened (0.1% peptone water) cotton ball
to swab a square of 15  15 cm within each point (approx. 1350 cm2
in total). The Ô¨Åve cotton balls collected from each carcass were
pooled and put into a sterile stomacher bag.

2.2.2. Environmental samples

During the slaughter process, environmental samples were also

collected as follows:

Scalding and cooling water: During slaughtering activities, 10 ml
of water samples were taken from the scalding and cooling tank
(The temperature range were kept between 5 and 10 C) once every
hour. The water samples were collected using a sterile collection
tube and the temperature was measured.

Lairage: At the beginning of the sampling, pens in the lairage
were already Ô¨Ålled with pigs to be slaughtered that day. For every
visit, Ô¨Åve pens were sampled using the overshoes method which
was carried out by walking around in an ‚Äò‚Äò8‚Äô‚Äô-shaped track in the
pen using one pair of disposable,
liquid absorbing overshoes
(Cobbaut, Houf, Douidah, Van Hende, & De Zutter, 2008).

Floor: The slaughterhouses were divided into Ô¨Åve parts, ac-
cording to the overall layout of the slaughterhouses and each part
covered a 1  1 m2 area. Sampling was done using four sterile
moistened (0.1% peptone water) cotton balls to swab each part. The
four cotton balls collected from each part were pooled and put into
a sterile stomacher bag.

Visceral processing countertop and waste water: At the end of
slaughtering, four areas of the countertop were sampled according
to its size and each part covered a 1  1 m2 area. The sample
method was the same as with the slaughterhouse Ô¨Çoor. During
slaughtering activities, water samples were taken from the
sewerage tank in the visceral processing room or the drain in the
countertop (slaughterhouse B without the visceral processing
room).

Each slaughterhouse had been visited 3 times.

Sterile gloves were used during the sampling procedures and
were changed between each sample. Samples were sent to the
laboratory in cooled containers (5e10 C) within the same day for
immediate analysis.

2.3. Sample preparation

2.3.1. Slaughtered pig samples preparation

Mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs): Once in the lab, the MLNs
were processed as previously described (Regulation EC 668/2006)
by removing the fat and the capsula followed by immersion in
alcohol 70% (v/v) and Ô¨Çaming to sterilize its surface. Finally, the
MLNs were cut into small pieces using sterile scissors, weighed and
transferred into 225 ml of buffered peptone water (BPW) (Difco, BD,
USA) for 18 h at 37 C.

Carcass swabs: All swabs of one carcass and according to one
sampling place were pooled and immediately immersed in 50 ml of
BPW and incubated directly by shaking.

2.3.2. Environmental samples preparation

Waste water, Scalding and cooling water: All the water samples
were carried pre-enrichment directly without the need to process.
Lairage, Floor and Visceral processing countertop samples: The
carcass swabs samples were immediately immersed in 50 ml of
BPW and incubated directly by shaking.

2.4. Salmonella isolation and identiÔ¨Åcation

Pre-enrichment was performed by 1:10 dilution of scalding
tank, cooling tank and waste water in BPW followed by incubation
at 37 C for 18e24 h. The swab samples such as carcass swabs,
lairage and Ô¨Çoor samples that were already immersed in 50 ml of
BPW were shaken and directly incubated. After stomaching, the
buffered peptone water suspensions were incubated at 37 C for
24 h, and 0.1 ml of this broth culture was subcultured in 10 ml of
rappaport-Vassiliadis enrichment broth (RV) broth (Difco, BD, USA)
at 42 C for a further 24 h. Following incubation, one loopful of each
RV broth was streaked onto xylose lysine tergitol 4 (XLT4) (Difco,
BD, USA), which was then incubated at 37 C for 24e48 h. The
presumptive Salmonella colony was picked from each plate and
streaked onto biochemical test triple sugar iron (TSI) (slants) and
lysine iron (LIA) agars (Hangzhou Microbial Reagent Co.), and
incubated for 24 h at 35 C. Isolates with typical color reactions
were conÔ¨Årmed as Salmonella based on results of the API-20E test
kit (bioMerieux, Marcy l‚ÄôEtoile, France). All strains were serotyped
according to the Kauffman-White scheme (Grimont et al., 2007).

2.5. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Antimicrobial resistance was determined by agar disk diffusion
tests on M√ºeller-Hinton agar plates according to the guidelines of
the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute CLIS (Clinical
Laboratory Institute Standards, 2009). The isolates were tested

against a total of 16 antimicrobials as follows: ampicillin (Amp,
10 mg), mezlocillin (Mez, 75 mg), cefazolin (Cfz, 30 mg), ceftriaxone
(Cro, 30 mg), cefotaxime (Ctx, 30 mg), gentamicin (Gen, 10 mg),
kanamycin (Kan, 20 mg), streptomycin (Str, 10 mg), tetracycline (Tet,
30 mg), chloramphenicol (Chl, 30 mg), oÔ¨Çoxacin (Ofx, 5 mg), enro-
Ô¨Çoxacin (Enr, 5 mg), norÔ¨Çoxacin (Nor, 5 mg), ciproÔ¨Çoxacin (Cip, 5 mg),
nalidixic acid (Nal, 30 mg) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Sxt,
1.25e23.75 mg). Pure cultures were grown overnight in Lur-
iaeBertani Broth (LB) (Merck, Germany) at 37 C and the concen-
tration was adjusted using sterile saline solution until a 0.5
McFarland turbidity was attained. One hundred microliters of the
culture was then swabbed onto Mueller Hinton agar using a sterile
cotton swab. Antimicrobial disks were placed on the surface of the
agar plate with enough distance to avoid overlapping of inhibition
zones. The plates were incubated at 37 C for 16e18 h and the re-
sults were interpreted as sensitive, intermediate, or resistant ac-
cording to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines
(Clinical Laboratory Institute Standards, 2012). Escherichia coli ATCC
25922 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 were used as quality
control strains. An isolate was deÔ¨Åned as ‚Äòresistant‚Äô after conÔ¨År-
mation of resistance to at least one agent tested, while ‚Äòmultidrug-
resistances‚Äô (MDR) was deÔ¨Åned as resistance to two or more agents.

2.6. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and sequence data analysis

Strains were grown aerobically in LuriaeBertani broth with
shaking at 37 C for 16e18 h. Genomic DNA isolation was carried
out using the TIANamp Bacteria DNA Kit (TIANGEN Biotech Co., Ltd,
China) according to the manufacturer's protocol. MLST was carried
out based on the scheme published on the Multilocus Sequence
Typing home page (http://mlst.ucc.ie/mlst/dbs/Senterica, accessed
December 30, 2012). MLST results were analyzed using Bio-
Numerics 5.0 software (Applied-Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium) and a
Minimum Spanning Tree (Le Hello et al., 2011) was made to study
the relatedness of
from the three
slaughterhouses.

The isolates that were chosen for PFGE are shown in Table 3.
Besides these, isolates with the same serotypes from pork, which
were previously isolated in our routine monitoring (Li et al., 2014),
were also used (Table 3). PFGE was performed according to the

protocol developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC) (Ribot et al., 2006). BrieÔ¨Çy, DNA embedded in
agarose plugs was digested with 50 U of Xba I (TaKaRa, Biotech-
nology Co. Ltd., Dalian, China) for 3 h in a water bath at 37 C. The
digested DNA was separated by electrophoresis in 0.5  TBE buffer
at 14 C for 22 h using a CHEF Mapper electrophoresis system (Bio-
Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) with pulse times of 2e63.8 s. The PulseNet
‚Äúuniversal‚Äù standard strain, S. enterica serovar Braenderup H9812,
was used as the control strain. PFGE agarose gels were stained with
ethidium bromide and the DNA band images were visualized on a
UV trans-illuminator (Bio-Rad). PFGE patterns were interpreted
with the aid of BioNumerics 5.0 software (Applied-Maths, Kortrijk,
Belgium) and compared by cluster analysis using Dice coefÔ¨Åcient
and the unweighted-pair group method with arithmetic averages
(UPGMA dendrogram type) with a position tolerance of 1.5% and
optimization of 0.5%.

2.8. Statistical analysis

Statistical comparison of Salmonella positive rates between
different slaughterhouses and different points in the same
slaughterhouse as well as the isolates resistance rate to the 16
antimicrobials were analyzed with the Chi-square (c2)test, which
was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
(version 15.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL) with p  0.05 considered as sta-
tistically signiÔ¨Åcant.

3. Results

3.1. Salmonella prevalence and serotypes

Among the total of 684 samples analyzed, 322 (47.1%) were
positive for Salmonella. The prevalence of positive samples was
51.6%, 47.9% and 43.1% in slaughterhouses A, B and C, respectively
(Table 4). No signiÔ¨Åcant differences were found amongst the
different slaughterhouses (c2 ¬º 2.6, p ¬º 0.27). However, high var-
iations were observed amongst the different sampling occasions at
the same slaughterhouse. On different sampling occasions, the
positive rates of Salmonella in slaughterhouse A ranged from 39.4%
to 59.3% (p < 0.05), from 36.6% to 64.8% in slaughterhouse B
(p < 0.05) and from 39.5% to 45.3% (p > 0.05) in slaughterhouse C
(Table 4).

On the three different sampling occasions (V1, V2 and V3), the
prevalence of Salmonella-positive slaughtered pigs samples ranged
from 38.5% to 59.2%. There were extremely distinct differences in
the Salmonella-positive rate for the different sampling occasions
(c2 ¬º 0.8, p < 0.01), and the risk of slaughtered pigs samples being
contaminated by Salmonella was two times higher at V3 than
compared with V1 (OR ¬º 2, 95% CI:1.3e3.1) and V2 (OR ¬º 2.3, 95%

CI:1.5e3.6) but there was no signiÔ¨Åcant difference between V1 and
V2 (p > 0.05).

With regards to slaughtered pigs, Salmonella was found most
frequently on carcass swab samples after evisceration (68.0%) and
after washing carcass samples (58.0%) which were much higher
than the submitting samples (32.0%) and lymph node samples
(7.0%). On carcass swab samples after eviceration especially, for
almost all the visits the prevalence rate of Salmonella was higher
than 50.0%, and in B3 the rate even reached 100.0% (Table 5).

As with the trend found for the slaughtered pig samples, the risk
of environmental samples positively contaminated with Salmonella
was also two times higher in V3 as compared with V1 (OR ¬º 2, 95%
CI:0.98e4.6) and V2 (OR ¬º 2.7, 95% CI:1.2e5.8) and there were
signiÔ¨Åcant differences between Salmonella prevalence in the envi-
ronmental samples. In addition, overshoes taken in the lairage were
highly contaminated with a small variation (ranging from 33.3 to
46.7%) between the three slaughterhouses.

isolates,

Thirteen different serotypes were identiÔ¨Åed among the 322
Salmonella isolates (Table 6). S. Derby was the most prevalent
serotype accounting for 52.8% of all
followed by S.
Meleagridis (13.4%) and S. Typhimurium (9.3%). Table 7 shows the
details of the Salmonella serotypes isolated from the slaughtered
pigs and environmental samples per slaughterhouse and per visit.
S. Derby was widely present in both slaughtered pigs and the
environmental samples collected from all three slaughterhouses.
Differences in serotypes were observed between the different
slaughterhouses and the different visits. S. Saintpaul, S. Agona, S.
Give and S. Corvallis were only found in slaughterhouse C, whereas
S. Leeson and S. Worthington were only detected in slaughterhouse
B. There were only four serotypes found in all slaughtered pigs and
the environmental samples sampled from slaughterhouse A, where
all isolates were identiÔ¨Åed as S. Derby, however one S. Infantis strain
was found during visit 2 to slaughterhouse A. In addition, all the
serotypes detected from the cooling water and Ô¨Çoor were also
found in strains isolated from slaughtered pig samples, similar to
the serotypes identiÔ¨Åed from slaughtered pigs in the lairage and
during submitting.

kanamycin (8.0%) was sporadic. For chloramphenicol, 28 (11.3%) of
the isolates were classiÔ¨Åed as resistant. Representing the sulfon-
amides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance was found in
69 of the Salmonella isolates. There were no differences in the
resistance rates of tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,
ampicillin, streptomycin and nalidixic acid between Salmonella
isolated from the environment and the slaughtered pig samples,
which ranged from 18.5% to 31.2% (p > 0.05).

There were 51 and 181 isolates resistant to at least one anti-
microbial, which presented 20 and 68 kinds of drug-resistant pat-
terns respectively, and the most common type were TET with the
percentages of 25.5% and 12.2% (Table 9). For MDR phenotypes, 32
and 131 different patterns were found among the strains from the
environment and slaughtered pig samples. One Salmonella Typhi-
murium isolate collected from slaughtered pig samples was resis-
tant to 11 antimicrobials (AMP, CFZ, CHL, GEN, KAN, MEZ, NAL, NOR,
STR, SXT and TET). The most common MDR patterns were SXT TET
(25%, 8/32) and STR TET (9.3%, 3/32) in environmental isolates,
while TET (13%, 17/131) and STR TET (5.3%, 7/131) were found in
isolates from slaughtered pig samples.

study, represented by 164 Salmonella isolates, followed by ST463
(43) and ST34 (28). Most STs obtained in this study were correlated
with certain serovars, such as ST40 with Salmonella Derby, ST13
with Salmonella Agona, and ST46 with Salmonella Newport.
Through cluster analysis, two clone complexes CC34 and CC40 were
found in the minimum spanning tree. In addition, ST34 and ST818
were the single-locus variants of ST19 and ST40, respectively.
Through a minimum spanning tree, we also found that slaughter-
house C had the most ST patterns while the least ST patterns were
found in slaughterhouse A.

3.4. PFGE analysis

As shown in Fig. 2, 56 ST40 S. Derby isolated from slaughter-
house and pork were identiÔ¨Åed as thirty-Ô¨Åve PFGE patterns, which
were grouped into seven clusters. PFGE Ô¨Ångerprinting proÔ¨Åles
grouped the isolates by origin, such as the strains typed as PF1 and
PF2 with the closer genetic distances all isolated from slaughter-
house A, and the strains with PF21 and PF22 types in Cluster 1 were
from slaughterhouse C. However some isolates from the same
slaughterhouse belonged to different clusters. For example, two
isolates grouped into cluster 7, while the remaining isolates
grouped mainly into cluster 1 and 3. Of particular interest was the
Ô¨Ånding that strains with the same PFGE types also shared the same
drug-resistance pattern, such as the isolates typed as PF1, PF3, PF12
and PF14. Nearly half of the S. Derby isolates obtained from pork
showed the same PFGE types as the isolates in slaughterhouse C.
Moreover, the same PFGE type can also be found in isolates from
Yangzhou pork and the carcass samples in two slaughterhouses. In
addition, four S. Derby isolates typed as PF26 were detected from
the cooling water and slaughtered pig samples in slaughterhouse A.
Sixteen Salmonella Typhimurium isolates showed ten patterns
and three clusters using a cutoff value of 85% similarity (Fig. 3).
Isolates in each cluster also showed similar resistance phenotypes
and ST types. The Ô¨Årst cluster contained Ô¨Åve S. Typhimurium iso-
lates of slaughtered pig samples from submitting, evisceration and
the carcasses. Four PFGE types (PF5, PF6, PF7 and PF10) were
identiÔ¨Åed from the six isolates in Yangzhou pork, four of which
showed the closest genetic relatedness with isolates from slaugh-
terhouse C and were clustered in group 2. However, the remaining
two strains have a further genetic distance than the others.

As far as the environment was concerned, no Salmonella was
detected in all scalding water samples, while an 80% positive rate
was observed in a slaughterhouse in Vietnam (Thai, 2007). Based
on the temperature measurement, we found the temperature of the
water in the scalding pool was maintained at above 60 C, which
effectively kills the Salmonella in the water. However, Salmonella
was identiÔ¨Åed from the cooling water samples in all visits, espe-
cially C3, B3, A1 and A2 in which all samples were detected as
Salmonella-positive. The slow circulation speed of the pooling wa-
ter and Salmonella leakage from the cavity of slaughtered pigs may
account for this result. In the summer, because of high tempera-
tures and poor water circulation, cooling water could become a
broth enriched with bacteria and contaminate all of the slaughtered
pigs that pass through the water continuously.

The prevalence of Salmonella in the lairages was similar to a
previous report from EFSA. Studies show that Salmonella can be
detected in the intestines of a slaughtered pig after just a 30 min
stay in the lairage, which can be an important cause of Salmonella
contamination at the surface of a slaughtered pig's body (EFSA,
2011).

The most prevalent serotypes were S. Derby and S. Typhimurium
followed by S. Anatum and S. Meleagridis. These results are in
accordance with other similar studies carried out in slaughter-
houses (Arguello et al., 2012; Bonardi et al., 2013; De Busser et al.,
2011; Gomes-Neves et al., 2012; Piras et al., 2011). In recent years,
S. Derby has become more frequent in worldwide pork production.
Based on a baseline EU survey, S. Derby was the most frequently
isolated serovar in both breeding and production holdings and can
become the potential source of the bacteria disseminated to
slaughtered pigs (EFSA, 2011). Moreover, S. Derby is also isolated
from cases of human salmonellosis and have been reported in
China and other countries (Hauser et al., 2011; Kerouanton, Rose,
Weill, Granier, & Denis, 2013; Ling et al., 2001). In our study, S.
Derby was also widely spread in carcass samples, which would then
be sold in public markets after splitting and weighing. Therefore,
we conclude that S. Derby can survive in certain niches of the three
slaughterhouses, and may become part of the resident Ô¨Çora (house
strains) and can result in subsequent carcass contamination of
slaughtered pigs passing along the slaughter line. In this way, all the
serotypes associated with swine species may lead to Salmonella
contamination of pork and cases of non-typhoidal salmonellosis
have been described in humans. There were various kinds of
serotype identiÔ¨Åed in this study, many of which were reported in
this city for the Ô¨Årst time. This could be related to the diverse source
of pigs in different slaughterhouses (Pan et al., 2010; Wang, Jiao, Liu,
Chen, & Huan, 2007; Zhou et al., 2013). We hypothesize that the
slaughterhouse can serve as a transport hub, where different Sal-
monella serotypes carried by pigs from different regions can be
released and subsequently through the pork on sale in the public
market, which causes a serious threat to public health.

The presence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens in food and
food products could enable the bacteria to spread via the food chain
to humans, causing infections (Angulo, Baker, Olsen, Anderson, &
Barrett, 2004). Observations in this study on the prevalence of
antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella isolates are in accordance
with other studies carried out at slaughterhouses (Bonardi et al.,
2013; Botteldoorn, Herman, Rijpens, & Heyndrickx, 2004), where
resistance to tetracycline was the most common phenotype
observed in 75.6% of the 716 isolates of S. enterica, followed by
ampicillin,
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and streptomycin.
Similar results were found in Salmonella isolates from food-
producing animals in our country (Han, Liu, Hou, Chen, & Peng,
2014; Yang et al., 2010). These drugs are commonly used in veter-
inary clinical medicine, which means the using of antibiotics in pig
production process is both complex and frequently in China.

was high. Salmonella was recovered from slaughtered pigs and in
their slaughterhouse environmental samples with an overall
prevalence of 46.6% and 48.4%, which was similar to that of pre-
vious studies conducted in slaughterhouses in Vietnam (48.8%) and
Belgium (48.2%) (De Busser et al., 2011; Thai, 2007), but higher than
those reported in the other areas of China and some developing
countries such as Italy, Denmark, Spain and Southwest China
(Baptista, Dahl, & Nielsen, 2010; Bonardi et al., 2013; De Busser
et al., 2011; Piras, Brown, Meloni, Mureddu, & Mazzette, 2011;
Hou, Liu, Han, & Wu, 2013). This could be because the poor Sal-
monella control measures taken during the slaughtering processing
caused serious Salmonella cross-contamination in the three
slaughterhouses. Contrary to what was expected, albeit with better
hygienic conditions and newer devices, we were unable to Ô¨Ånd a
signiÔ¨Åcant difference in Salmonella prevalence between the three
slaughterhouses. This illustrates that the key points of the slaugh-
tering process in different slaughterhouses should be ascertained
and well controlled.

Slaughtered pigs and environmental samples were higher at
risk of being contaminated during visit 3, which was from April
2012 to July 2012, compared with the rest of the survey period. The
effect that these same sampling months increased the risk of
surface contamination of carcasses was previously reported (EFSA,
2008a). It illustrates that the prevalence of Salmonella in slaugh-
terhouses may be greatly affected by seasonal factors, but this
hypothesis should be studied further and conÔ¨Årmed by additional
studies. In our research, the prevalence of Salmonella in lymph
node samples ranged from 12.5% to 25%, in accordance with 13.9%
reported from EFSA (EFSA, 2008a,b). In literature, several authors
emphasize the role of Salmonella-infected pigs in causing
contamination and cross contamination during the slaughtering
process, so it is quite necessary to perform pre-slaughter in-
spections and quarantines (Arguello, Carvajal, Collazos, Garc√≠a-
Feliz, & Rubio, 2012). There were large differences in Salmonella
between slaughtered pig samples at different sampling sites, such
as in B3 the prevalence of Salmonella in submitting samples was
only 6.7%, but in carcass samples the positive rate raised was as
high as 60% (p < 0.01), suggesting that an incorrect slaughter
process and cross-contamination within the slaughterhouse can
lead to Salmonella contamination in pigs that were not carriers
(Arguello et al., 2012).

MLST could be used to overcome the limitations of the tradi-
tional serotyping method and provide reliable identiÔ¨Åcation of the
most common Salmonella serotypes and their associated evolu-
tionary information. In our study, we used MLST as a regular tool for
Salmonella preliminary classiÔ¨Åcation and for rapid and accurate
identiÔ¨Åcation of serotyping (Achtman et al., 2012). ST40 was the
most common genotype in isolates recovered from the three
slaughterhouses in this study, which was in accordance with our
study on retail pork in Yangzhou (Li et al., 2014). According to the
previous report, ST40 Salmonella isolates may spread widely
throughout the pork production chain. The remaining common STs
in Salmonella from the three slaughterhouses such as ST34, ST155
and ST64 were also frequently in Salmonella from the retail pork (Li
et al., 2014). However, S. Typhimurium ST34 and ST19, which were
associated with the ACSSuT type (resistance to amoxicillin, chlor-
amphenicol,
and tetracyclines)
showing higher mortality rates were frequently detected in our
study (Molbak, 2005; Wong et al., 2013), which indicated serious
contaminations of such S. Typhimurium in the pork production
chain and may pose a great threat to public health.

As an important method of the molecular typing of Salmonella,
PFGE plays an important role in tracking the sources of infection
and epidemic control, which is known as the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù in
molecular typing of bacteria (Villalon et al., 2011). In the present
study, PFGE had a higher discriminatory power than MLST, and the
Salmonella with the same PFGE type mostly derived from the same
slaughterhouse and was placed in the same cluster, showing
evident regional characteristics. In addition, the isolates with the
same PFGE type pattern shared similar resistant phenotype and ST
types, which support previous
(Harbottle, White,
McDermott, Walker, & Zhao, 2006).

reports

The same PFGE types could be found in carcass samples of both
slaughterhouses and pork, proving the spread of Salmonella be-
tween slaughterhouses and pork in the public market. Four S. Derby
isolates with the same PFGE type (PF26) were detected in the

samples of the environment and the slaughtered pigs in slaugh-
terhouse A,
indicating cross contamination between the two
sources. Six S. typhimurium in cluster 1 with the same ST type
(ST19), which can be considered as the same Salmonella clone, came
from different points of the slaughtered pigs, and took place during
horizontal transmission along the slaughtering processing. This il-
lustrates that carcass contamination originates from both the
environment and the slaughtered pig. In addition, by comparing
the PFGE type between the slaughterhouses and the pork, it was
revealed that Salmonella in Yangzhou pork were mostly correlated
with the strains in slaughterhouse C.

5. Conclusion

In summary, we examined the epidemiology of Salmonella from
three slaughterhouses in Yangzhou located in eastern China. The
results of this study illustrated the distribution, antimicrobial sus-
ceptibility proÔ¨Åles, serotype and genotype in Salmonella isolates
from three slaughterhouses in different time periods, and revealed
the clonal relationships of recovered strains and their involvement
in three slaughterhouses and pork from related public markets.
Contamination and cross contamination frequently occurred inside
the slaughterhouse and can also be important sources of Salmonella
contamination in pork sold in the public market. Further research
in more complete pork production chains in Jiangsu are required,
which can help us to identify the source and character of the most
prevalent Salmonella isolates in production chains and conÔ¨Årm
critical control points in the whole production chain so that
contamination risks in hog and pork products can be reduced.
