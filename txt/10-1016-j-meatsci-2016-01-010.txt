1. Introduction

Meat can be contaminated in different stages of the slaughtering process and the identiﬁcation of these stages is
the starting point to implement adequate control measures. The objectives of this study were to assess the
presence of pathogenic microorganisms in cattle carcasses, to identify the most important contamination points
of the slaughtering process, and to evaluate the possible risk factors related to them in a cattle slaughterhouse. To
this aim, 108 cattle carcasses were sampled at three stages of the slaughtering process: Point 1 (hides after bleed-
ing); Point 2 (carcasses after hide removal); and Point 3 (carcasses immediately after division). Escherichia coli
O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella Livingstone were isolated from the carcasses. Phenotypic and
genotypic characterization indicated that there was cross-contamination among animals, since bacteria with
identical genotypic and phenotypic proﬁles were isolated from different animals at the same sampling day.
Furthermore, this is the ﬁrst report about the isolation of E. coli O157:H7 in a bovine slaughterhouse from
southern Brazil.

can
contaminate cattle meat, Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and
Escherichia coli O157:H7 are frequently pointed out as responsible for
foodborne illnesses (Nouichi & Hamdi, 2009; Antic et al., 2010). Accord-
ing to Scallan et al. (2012) and the Ministry of Health/Brazil (MS -
Ministry of Health, 2014), animal products are recognized as the
major cause of foodborne diseases worldwide and the effective preven-
tion of outbreaks depends on, among others factors, the microbiological
quality of raw material used.

Another issue related to foodborne diseases is the pathogenic
bacteria featuring antimicrobial resistance, which can be a serious

threat to public health, as it makes the treatment of infectious diseases
difﬁcult (Arslan & Eyi, 2010). The increased use of antimicrobials in
animal production and human medicine is a signiﬁcant factor in the
emergence of pathogens resistant to antibiotics (Silva, Hovarth, G., &
Tondo, 2014; Nespolo, Saba, Rossatelli, Fairbrother, & Júnior, 2014).
Based on these facts, information about sources of resistant pathogens
that can contaminate meat is of great importance and is one of the
main reasons of the present study, which aimed to assess the contamina-
tion of cattle hides and carcasses at different stages of the slaughtering
process in southern Brazil. Moreover, we characterized the pathogenic
organisms according to their antimicrobial proﬁles and genotypic
characteristics.

to 700 animals/day. Besides, it was located in the central region of the
Rio Grande do Sul State (RS), receiving cattle from several districts.

2.2. Sampling

From September 2010 to February 2012 (6 sampling days), samples
from 108 animals of different Rio Grande do Sul regions and farms were
collected. Three points of the cattle slaughtering process were assessed:
Point 1 (P1): animal hides, just after bleeding; Point 2 (P2): carcasses,
just after hide removal and before evisceration; and Point 3 (P3): after
carcasses are cut into two large pieces for handling — totaling 324
samples. Carcasses were sampled using the sponge method, applied
on the pectoral region according to the European Community guidelines
(Commission Regulation — EC, 2007). Each point was sampled
using four sponges, each of them scrubbed on a 100 cm2 region
(400 cm2/point; 1200 cm2/carcass) (Andrews & Hammack, 1998).
After collection, the four sponges from each point were placed into a
sterile plastic bag and stored at 4 °C until analysis. Table 1 shows the
sample features and animals in this study.

2.3. Microbiological analyses

For each plastic bag containing the sponges, 200 mL of sterile 0.85% saline
solution was added. The bags were then placed into a Stomacher (Seward,
USA) at low speed for removal of the adhered material over the sponges.

2.3.1. Total count of aerobic mesophilic microorganisms

Aerobic Plate Count Petri ﬁlms (3M Health Care, USA) were used to
estimate the total count of mesophilic microorganisms. Five dilutions
were plated in duplicate and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Red colonies
were included in the count regardless of size or color intensity. The re-
sults were expressed as the log number of colony forming units (CFU)
per unit area (cm2). This method was performed in accordance with
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 4833:2003, 2003.

2.3.2. Counting of generic E. coli

Coliforms and E. coli Petri ﬁlms (3M Health Care, USA) were used to
estimate the count of generic E. coli. Five dilutions of the initial material
were plated in duplicate and incubated at 35 °C for 48 h. Blue colonies
with gas production were counted as E. coli. The results were expressed
as log of CFU/cm2. This method was performed in accordance with
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 21528-2:2004, 2004.

2.3.3. Isolation and identiﬁcation of Salmonella spp.

During the pre-enrichment step, 25 mL of the suspension was mixed
with 225 mL of buffered peptone saline water (BPW; Oxoid, England),
and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, 1 mL and 0.1 mL were

transferred to 10 mL of Muller–Kauffmann tetrathionate–novobiocin
(MKTTn, Oxoid, England) and Rappaport–Vassilliadis with soy broths
(RVS, Oxoid, England) and incubated at 37 °C and 41.5 °C, respectively,
for 24 h. Then, a loopful of each RVS and MKTTn broth was inoculated in
xylose lysine deoxycholate (XLD, Oxoid, England) and mannitol lysine
crystal violet brilliant green agar (MLCB, Oxoid, England) and incubated
at 37 °C for 24 h. Candidate colonies were puriﬁed on nutrient agar and
conﬁrmed biochemically using API 20E kits (BioMérieux, USA) and
serologically using poly “O” and “H” antisera (Probac, Brazil). This
method was performed in accordance with International Organization
for Standardization (ISO) 6579, 2001.

2.3.4. Isolation and identiﬁcation of Listeria spp.

For Listeria spp. isolation, 40 mL of the homogenized suspension
(after removal of adhered material over the sponges, as described
above) was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 min. The pellet was resus-
pended in half Fraser broth (Oxoid, England) and incubated at 30 °C
for 24 h. After this, 0.1 mL was transferred to 10 mL Fraser broth
(Oxoid, England) and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. After the incubation,
a loopful was inoculated on selective Agar Chromogenic and Agar Ox-
ford (Oxoid, England) and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. For biochemical
characterization, three to ﬁve candidate colonies of Listeria spp. were
transferred to trypticase soy agar plates (TSA, Oxoid, England) supple-
mented with 0.6% yeast extract (TSA–YE, Difco, USA). The plates were
incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. The colonies were submitted to analysis at
oblique light incidence transmitted at 45° (Henry method) and further
subjected to biochemical identiﬁcation using the following tests:
catalase, carbohydrate fermentation, β-hemolysis, Voges–Proskauer
(VP), methyl red (MR), gram staining, motility and CAMP test
(McFaddin, 2000). After biochemical testing, the candidate isolates of
Listeria spp. were tested by agglutination of “O” and “H” as recommend-
ed by Donker-Voet (1959) and Seeliger and Höhne (1979). This method
was carried out in accordance with International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) 11290-1 and 11290-2, 2002.

2.3.5. Isolation and identiﬁcation of E. coli O157:H7

After processing on a Stomacher, 25 mL of the homogenized suspen-
sion was mixed to 225 mL of modiﬁed tryptone soy broth (Oxoid,
England) containing 0.45 mg of novobiocin (Laborclin, Brazil) and incu-
bated at 41.5 °C for 24 h. Target microorganisms were concentrated by
immunomagnetic
separation (IMS) using magnetic particles
(Dynabeads, Invitrogen, USA) coated with anti-O157 antibodies. The
pellet was inoculated onto ceﬁxime tellurite sorbitol MacConkey agar
and sorbitol MacConkey agar (both Oxoid, England). Sorbitol-negative
colonies were characterized by the following biochemical tests: indol,
beta-glucuronidase analysis and agglutination with E. coli O157 antise-
rum (Probac, Brazil). This method was applied in accordance with
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 16654-2001, 2001.

2.4. Molecular typing

2.4.1. DNA extraction

Salmonella spp. DNA was extracted using a Wizard® Genomic DNA kit
(Promega, USA), following the manufacturer's instructions. Genomic DNA
of Listeria spp. and E. coli O157:H7 were extracted by heat, as previously de-
scribed (Doumith, Buchrieser, Glaser, Jacquet, & Martin, 2004; Border,
Howard, Plastow, & Siggens, 1990; Paula, Geimba, Amaral, & Tondo, 2010).

2.4.2. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

Multiplex PCR was used to analyze the virulence of Salmonella spp.,
Listeria spp. and E. coli O157:H7 isolates. The sequences and references
of the oligonucleotides used in this study are shown in Table 2. The pres-
ence of invA, sefA and spvC genes was evaluated in Salmonella isolates.
Listeria spp. serotype identiﬁcation was carried out by the presence of
lmo1118, lmo0737, ORF 2110, ORF 2819, prs and hlyA genes. The

presence of virulence genes eaeA, stx1 and stx2 was evaluated in E. coli
O157:H7 isolates.

2.4.3. E. coli O157:H7 genetic characterization

E. coli O157:H7 isolates were submitted to molecular typing by
pulsed ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using the PulseNet protocol (Ribot
et al., 2006). Visualization and gel imaging were performed on an Image
Quant 300 imager (Bio-Rad). Results were analyzed using BioNumerics
software (Applied Maths, Belgium). Banding pattern similarities were com-
pared using one-enzyme analysis with 1.5% band position tolerance. An in-
ternational standard Salmonella Braenderup strain (H9812) was used as
control. Dice similarity coefﬁcients and the unweighted pair group method
with averages were used to calculate similarity coefﬁcients. E. coli strain
O157:H7-INCQS 00171 and an E. coli O157:H7 isolate from a foodborne out-
break in Argentina were used as positive controls.

2.5. Cytotoxicity assay

Expression of Stx1 and Stx2 toxins was evaluated by cytotoxicity
assay in Vero cells, performed according to World Organization for An-
imal Health recommendations (OIE, 2008). Two verotoxin-producing
and two non-toxin producing E. coli O157:H7 strains were included in
each test as positive and negative controls, respectively. Cell viability
evaluation was performed as described by Mosmann (1983). Results
were calculated based on the percentage of viable cells compared to
cells incubated with a non-verotoxigenic bacteria supernatant. Isolates
with toxicity higher than 70% in 72 h were considered verotoxic.

2.6. Antimicrobial susceptibility analysis

The isolates were tested for their resistance to antimicrobial agents,
which are currently used in veterinary and human therapy, according to
the National Committee for Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
(NCCLS/CLSI, 2012). Antibiotic disks (NewProv, Brazil) with ampicillin
(AMP, 10 μg), clindamycin (CLI, 2 mg), cefoxitin (CFX, 30 mg), cephalo-
thin (CF, 30 mg), cefotaxime (CTX, 30 mg), imipenem (IPM, 10 mg),
chloramphenicol (CL, 30 μg), gentamicin (GEN, 10 μg), kanamycin (K,
30 μg), streptomycin (STR, 10 μg), amikacin (AMI, 30 μg), ciproﬂoxacin
(CIP, 5 μg), nalidixic acid (NAL,30 μg), tetracycline (TET, 30 μg),
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT, 25 μg), and sulfonamide (SSS,
300 μg) were used in order to evaluate E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella
isolates. E. coli ATCC 8739 was used as control. In addition to these,

(ERY, 15 μg), minocycline (MIN, 30 μg) and trimethoprim (TRI, 5 g)
were used to test Listeria spp. isolates. Since there are no standards or
limits for testing Listeria spp. antimicrobials, the limits used were
those established for Staphylococcus spp., as published by De Nes et al.
(2010). L. monocytogenes ATCC 6477 strain was used as control.

2.7. Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using Stata software version
12.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA). To compare the
contamination frequencies with pathogenic bacteria among the differ-
ent collection points, Fisher's exact test was carried out. For risk factor
analysis, positive samples were considered as the ones with at least
one isolated pathogen. Different scores were attributed to each inde-
pendent variable to be evaluated (Table 1); then, a univariate analysis
with dummy variables was created to test the effects of the interactions
between them. Variables with p b 0.05 were selected to multivariate
logistic regression analysis, which was performed stepwise.

3. Results

3.1. Mesophilic and E. coli counts

Mean mesophilic counts were 4.98, 2.90, and 2.30 log CFU/cm2 in P1,
P2 and P3, respectively. Regarding E. coli, means of 2.33, 0.64 and
0.09 CFU/cm2 were observed at P1, P2 and P3, respectively. The mean
counts observed in P1 were statistically different from those observed
in other points for both groups (p b 0.05) (Table 3).

3.2. E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp.

E. coli O157:H7, Listeria spp. and Salmonella Livingstone were isolat-
ed from 22 (20.37%), 11 (10.19%) and 1 (0.93%) of 108 carcasses, respec-
tively. Most pathogens were isolated on bovine hide (Table 3). Among
Listeria spp. isolates, 7 were identiﬁed as L. monocytogenes, two as
Listeria innocua serovar 6a, and two remained unidentiﬁed at species
level, being classiﬁed as Listeria spp.; L. monocytogenes isolates were
identiﬁed as serotype 1/2a (by the gene IMO 0737) and 4b (by ORF
2110 and ORF 2819 genes) (Table 4).

3.3. Virulence genes and antimicrobial resistance phenotypes

The Salmonella Livingstone isolate was positive for invA and sefA
genes, and negative for the spvC gene. Among L. monocytogenes isolates,
all of them were positive for the hlyA gene (Table 4). Most E. coli
O157:H7 isolates were positive for eae, stx1 and stx2 genes (Table 5).
Accordingly, cytotoxicity analysis revealed that 95.45% (21/22) of
E. coli O157:H7 isolates were verotoxigenic.

The Salmonella Livingstone isolate showed resistance against six
antimicrobials, i.e. ampicillin, clindamycin, cephalothin, cefoxitin,
erythromycin, and vancomycin and was intermediately resistant to
nalidixic acid. Regarding L. monocytogenes, all isolates were resistant
to nalidixic acid and most showed resistance to cefoxitin (90.91%),
clindamycin (90.91%), cephalothin (81.82%) and sulfonamide
(54.55%). L. monocytogenes resistance patterns were classiﬁed into ﬁve
proﬁles (a to e) (Fig. 1A and B). E. coli O157:H7 isolates had high levels
of resistance, with 100% of them resistant to clindamycin (Fig. 1C).
Resistance patterns were classiﬁed into seven proﬁles (a to g) (Fig. 1C
and D).

3.4. Genotypic and phenotypic characterization of E. coli O157:H7 and
Listeria spp.

E. coli O157:H7 isolates were classiﬁed into four genotypic patterns
(A to D), according to PCR multiplex results (Table 5). Restriction en-
zyme analysis at PFGE with XbaI was able to discriminate six proﬁles
(1 to 6; Table 5 and Supplementary Fig. 1). A general proﬁle based on
phenotypic and genotypic characteristics was created; thus, ten general
proﬁles were identiﬁed (I to X). Isolates assigned to Proﬁle I were
recovered from hides of different animals sampled in the same day, at
sampling Point 1 (isolates 9, 11, 12, 16 and 17). Proﬁle I also grouped
isolates from the same carcass, but at different sampling points (isolates
20, 21, and 22) (Table 5). Interestingly, isolates 7, 19, and C1 demon-
strated the same Proﬁle VI, but two of them were isolated in the present
study on hide and carcass, respectively, and the third was isolated from
a foodborne outbreak in Argentina in 2005.

Listeria spp. isolates were classiﬁed into four different genotype pat-
terns (A to D) according to PCR results (Table 3). Based on genotypic
and phenotypic characteristics, ten general proﬁles were created (I to
X). As for E. coli O157:H7, there were isolates recovered from the
same animal but at different sampling points (isolates 2 and 6 — proﬁle
VII) (Table 4), indicating cross-contamination on the slaughter process.

3.5. Longitudinal analysis of carcass contamination

The largest number of pathogenic isolates was recovered from P1
(Table3); however, when analyzing mesophilic counts, L. monocytogenes
and E. coli O157:H7 by Fischer exact test, there was no statistical
difference (p N 0.05) among the three points. For generic E. coli counts,
there was a decrease on contamination in points P2 and P3, as compared
to P1 (p b 0.05).

Univariate analysis showed that the sampling points 1 and 3, sum-
mer season, south and west regions and animal age were associated
with a higher chance of contamination (Table 6). At multivariate analy-
sis, the sampling Point 1 and summer season were risk factors for con-
tamination with higher odds ratios (Table 7). Thus, despite the lack of
difference on individual analysis, the multivariate data indicated that
the presence of pathogens decreased in different slaughtering stages.

4. Discussion

Microorganisms can be present in cattle on animal hair, skin, and the
intestinal tract, and may contaminate red meat during the slaughter
process if appropriate good hygienic practices (GHP) were not applied
(Gill & Landers, 2004; Shah, Shringi, Besser, & Call, 2010). The microbial
contaminations during animal transport and from animal feed or
contaminated surfaces are other factors that may inﬂuence the meat
contamination inside slaughterhouses (Nørrung & Buncic, 2008). If
these microorganisms are not inactivated before consumption, they
can cause foodborne diseases; thus, meat processing control and main-
tenance of low microbial loads reduce the possibility of pathogen trans-
mission (Sofos & Geornaras, 2010). Therefore, the present study aimed
to monitor contamination during the slaughter process through

mesophilic microorganisms and generic E. coli quantiﬁcation and also to
detect and characterize pathogenic bacteria in cattle at an abattoir in
southern Brazil. The results showed high mesophilic and generic E. coli
counts mainly on animal hides and also the presence of E. coli
O157:H7, L. monocytogenes and Salmonella Livingstone.

4.1. Longitudinal analysis of carcass contamination

High counts of microorganisms on animal hides are expected;
however this is related to the likelihood of meat contamination in
other points of the slaughter line (Gonzales-Barron, Piza, Xavier, Costa,
& Cadavez, 2014; Khan et al., 2014). We observed that mesophilic
counts were higher in P1, decreasing at subsequent assessed points.
This suggests that dirt, feces, soil and dust were important sources of
hide contamination during the slaughter process. Corroborating with
this result, the majority of pathogens was isolated in P1. Several studies
have shown that meat microbial contaminations in the abattoir occur
during the skin cutting and opening, as well as during hide removal
(Gill, McGinnis, & Bryant, 1998; McEvoy et al., 2004; Antic et al., 2010)
with a decrease on contamination after this step (Gill et al., 1998;
Phillips, Sumner, Alexander, & Dutton, 2001; Sumner et al., 2003).

The isolation of pathogenic microorganisms in the present study,
besides providing information about their occurrence, which is a public
health issue, also allowed us to survey the contamination in different
points of the slaughterhouse; thus, the proﬁles created based on
genotypic and phenotypic characteristics were used to evaluate cross-
contamination in the abattoir. Therefore, of 10 E. coli O157:H7 general
proﬁles, four were isolated at the same day, but on different animals
(Table 5). The same was observed for two L. monocytogenes isolates
(Table 4). This ﬁnding may strongly indicate an animal's contamination
in the farm, during transport and/or at the beginning of the slaughter
process. On the other hand, isolates with the same proﬁle found at
different points may indicate cross-contamination inside the slaughter-
house, as was observed here in the case of L. monocytogenes (isolates 2
and 6; Table 4), and E. coli 0157:H7 (isolates 20, 21 and 22; Table 5).
This information may be used to monitor contamination or to guide
implementation review of GHP procedures.

4.2. Pathogenic microorganisms

important

identiﬁed as

The pathogenic microorganisms isolated in this study belong to
species
food pathogens worldwide.
Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), in which E. coli O157:H7 is included,
are currently considered some of the most important food pathogens.
They can be transmitted from bovine feces to carcasses inside slaughter-
houses, and the consumption of undercooked meat is the main cause of
transmission to humans (Nataro & Kaper, 1998; Meng, Doyle, Zhao, &
Zhao, 2007). E. coli O157:H7 strains have been isolated in more than
30 countries in the six continents (Bustamante, Sanso, Lucchesi, &
Parma, 2010; Esumeh, Isibor, & Egbagbe, 2011; Oliveira, Viñas, Usall,
Anguera, & Abadias, 2012; Velasco, Tydings, Boyer, Falkinham, &
Ponder, 2012; Paula, Loiko, & Tondo, 2014); however, in Brazil, there
is only one described foodborne disease outbreak, which was caused
by ingestion of undercooked meat.

This study is the ﬁrst report of isolation of E. coli O157:H7 in red meat
of southern Brazil. The bacterium was isolated from 20.37% of the inves-
tigated animals, and although most of the isolates were from hide
surfaces, which also had the major diversity of proﬁles, some of them
were found on the carcasses. Interestingly, our ﬁndings showed pheno-
typic and genotypic similarity of 7 19 and C1 isolates (Supplementary
Fig. 1; Table 5), suggesting possible transfer of E. coli O157:H7 clones be-
tween Brazil and Argentina. There are many reports of E. coli O157:H7 in
cattle feces in Brazil, but just a few related to hide and beef carcass
(Paula et al., 2014).

Most of the isolates were cytotoxic and obtained from animals 12–
23 months of age (81.8%), which is in accordance with previously pub-
lished data, which shows higher prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in steers
and calves than in adults (Nielsen, Tegtmeier, Andersen, Gronbaek, &
Andersen, 2002; Moreira et al., 2003). Regarding cytotoxicity, few
E. coli O157:H7 previously isolated from Brazilian cattle feces had the
Shiga toxin (Stx) gene, with prevalence ranging from 1.2% to 95%,
depending on the region (Moreira et al., 2003; Sandrini, Pereira, Brod,
Carvalhal, & Aleixo, 2007; Stella et al., 2009; Vicente, Amaral, Nunes, &
Lorenzon, 2010).

Salmonella Livingstone was isolated from one (0.93%) carcass at P3,
after hide removal and before cooling. A similar result was found by

Azevedo (2009), who isolated Salmonella spp. in 2% of bovine carcasses
at the same process point. Low isolation of Salmonella spp. may indicate
absence or low number of the bacteria on sampled areas, low sensitivity
of the method used to detect stressed cells (Meyer, Thiel, Ullrich, et al.,
2010), or may be related to high mesophilic counts, which can inhibit
its proliferation.

Regarding L. monocytogenes, seven isolates were found at the three
analyzed points. Moreover, two isolates of L. innocua and two of Listeria
spp. were identiﬁed, which is indicative of suitable conditions for
L. monocytogenes growth (Atil, Ertas, & Ozbey, 2011; Khan et al.,
2014). The L. monocytogenes isolates were virulent, which is required
for their survival and proliferation and is associated with hemolysis in
the host. The presence of L. monocytogenes on carcasses is generally at-
tributed to environmental contamination or fecal matter during slaugh-
ter, and it was estimated that 11–52% of healthy animals are carriers of
these organisms (Rocourt, 1994). The maintenance of L. monocytogenes
in the slaughterhouse is of great concern, since it is involved in severe
foodborne illness outbreaks and due to its ability to proliferate, even
at low temperatures (Sofos & Geornaras, 2010). L. monocytogenes

serotypes 1/2a and 1/2b are mainly found in meat products and
slaughtering environment and are the most prevalent serotypes found
in foods (He Yan et al., 2010; Gianfranceschi et al., 2009). More than
95% of human listeriosis cases were caused by L. monocytogenes 4b
and 1/2a serotypes (Fugett, Schoonmaker-Bopp, Dumas, Corby, &
Wiedmann, 2007). In the present study, these serotypes were isolated
from three analyzed points.

E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes isolates showed high levels of
antimicrobial resistance (Fig. 1), which is important information for
public health concerns. The use of antimicrobials as growth promoting
agents in animals can modify their intestinal microbiota, creating a se-
lection pressure favoring the development of antimicrobial resistant
strains (Conter et al., 2009). Likewise, multidrug resistance is a problem
in cases of foodborne outbreaks involving people infected with resistant
bacteria (Conter et al., 2009; Diarra & Malouin, 2014). Listeria spp. resis-
tance varies depending on the antibiotic use and the region; therefore, it
is necessary to control antimicrobial resistance of L. monocytogenes
worldwide (Wang et al., 2013). E. coli O157:H7 antimicrobial resistance
poses a major challenge in both human and animal medicine, since the

antibiotics used for this pathogen are commonly used in the treatment
of human patients and in veterinary practice (WHO, 2000; Reuben &
Owuna, 2013). The uncontrolled use of these drugs and their incorpora-
tion into animal feed contribute to development of resistance in
humans and animals (Galland, Hyatt, Crupper, & Acheson, 2001;
Reuben & Owuna, 2013).

5. Conclusion

The phenotypic and genotypic characterization in the present study
showed virulent and multi-resistant isolates, which can be a public
health issue. The results can be used as an alert to policymakers,
highlighting the need to prevent multidrug resistance, as many antimi-
crobials can be used both in veterinary and human medicine. This study
also showed that the bovine hides were the main source of bacterial
contamination, but there was also isolation of pathogens in other
assessed points. Based on these facts, the proper hide removal and
implementation of GHP procedures to reduce cross-contamination are
the most important control measures to be implemented in the cattle
slaughter process.
