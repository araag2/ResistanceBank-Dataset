Campylobacter is a major foodborne pathogen frequently associated with human
bacterial gastroenteritis in the world. This study was conducted to determine the
prevalence and antibiotic resistance of Campylobacter spp. in the beef food system in
Malaysia. A total of 340 samples consisting of cattle feces (n = 100), beef (n = 120) from
wet markets and beef (n = 120) from hypermarkets were analyzed for Campylobacter
spp. The overall prevalence of Campylobacter was 17.4%, consisting of 33% in cattle
fecal samples, 14.2% in raw beef from wet market and 7.5% in raw beef from the
hypermarket. The multiplex-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identiﬁed 55% of the strains
as C. jejuni, 26% as C. coli, and 19% as other Campylobacter spp. A high percentage
of Campylobacter spp. were resistant to tetracycline (76.9%) and ampicillin (69.2%),
whilst low resistance was exhibited to chloramphenicol
(7.6%). The MAR Index of
Campylobacter isolates from this study ranged from 0.09 to 0.73. The present study
indicates the potential public health risk associated with the beef food system, hence
stringent surveillance, regulatory measures, and appropriate interventions are required
to minimize Campylobacter contamination and prudent antibiotic usage that can ensure
consumer safety.

INTRODUCTION

Thermophilic Campylobacter is a major bacterial pathogen that causes foodborne infections around
the world (EFSA, 2011; WHO, 2012). C. jejuni and C. coli have been identiﬁed as the most
common species that lead to campylobacteriosis (Silva et al., 2011). The high incidence rate
of campylobacteriosis can be associated with the low minimal infective dose of thermophilic

Campylobacter in Cattle and Beef Meat in Malaysia

Campylobacter which is around 500–800 cells (Nachamkin et al.,
2008). Campylobacter spp. colonize the enteric tract of birds,
sheep, cattle and pigs (Stanley and Jones, 2003; Humphrey et al.,
2007). Food originated from animals act as the primary source of
Campylobacter infection (Doorduyn et al., 2010).

health
(Chatre et al., 2010; Aarestrup, 2015). Increasing resistance
in Campylobacter to antimicrobials particularly to tetracycline,
erythromycin, and (ﬂuoro)quinolones (Gaudreau and Gilbert,
2003; Zhu et al., 2006) was associated with reduce response
to therapy leading to higher morbidity and mortality rates in
humans (Zhu et al., 2006).

Campylobacter a major public health concern around the
world, especially in developed countries and these countries have
Campylobacter surveillance systems (Scallan et al., 2011; EFSA
and ECDC, 2014). Even in the South-East Asia, Campylobacter
is becoming a key foodborne pathogen (Premarathne et al.,
2017). According to a hospital-based study conducted by Lee
and Puthucheary (2002), Campylobacter spp. was reported at 5%
prevalence level and placed among the ﬁrst ﬁve causative agents
associated with child’s diarrhea. Furthermore, Campylobacter
were reported in humans from Indonesia (Tjaniadi et al., 2003),
Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Yamashiro et al., 1998),
Singapore (Chau et al., 2016), and Thailand (Bodhidatta et al.,
2013). Singapore is the only South-East Asian country that
performs national surveillance of Campylobacter infection in
humans. Estimation and control of campylobacteriosis in South-
East Asian countries, including Malaysia, is hindered due to
insuﬃcient regulations for food safety and inadequate data
on epidemiology of Campylobacter cases (Premarathne et al.,
2017). Therefore, prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of
Campylobacter are important to be assessed in these countries.

In Malaysia, beef is sold in traditional wet markets and
modern hypermarkets (Chamhuri and Batt, 2013). Beef available
in wet markets were supplied by locally slaughtered and dressed
cattle at
the municipal abattoir or none-abattoir premises
(Marimuthu et al., 2015). The wet markets were operated for a
short time around 6 h per day and were able to provide fresh meat
every day (Tang et al., 2009). The hypermarkets oﬀered chilled
or frozen meat that locally produced or from imported beef
(Ariﬀ et al., 2015). According to a consumer survey, Malaysians
considered that fresh meat is more succulent, healthier and assure
the halalness. Therefore, they preferred purchasing meat from
wet markets over hypermarkets (Chamhuri and Batt, 2013).

Naturally Campylobacter are present in cattle; therefore,
feces can contaminate the beef carcasses during slaughtering
(Hakkinen et al., 2007). Further, a study conducted in Malaysisa
found that C. jejuni can survive in food processing environments
through formation of bioﬁlms (Teh et al., 2014). The prevalence
of Campylobacter species in poultry (Tang et al., 2009; Mansouri-
Najand et al., 2012; Rejab et al., 2012), duck (Nor Faiza et al.,
2013) and salad vegetables (Chai et al., 2007) have been reported
in Malaysia. However, limited data exist on the prevalence of
Campylobacter in other food commodities, including beef food
system. Impelled by scarcity of data, this study was conducted
to determine the prevalence of Campylobacter in the beef

food system together with assessing the antibiogram proﬁles of
Campylobacter spp.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Bacterial Strains
In this study C. jejuni ATCC 33221 and C. coli ATCC 33559 were
used as the positive controls.

Sample Collection
A total of 100 fecal samples were collected from apparently
healthy beef cattle in three diﬀerent farms, while purchased 120
chilled beef samples from hypermarkets (n = 6) and 120 fresh
beef samples from wet markets (n = 6) in Selangor, Malaysia. All
collected samples were immediately transported to the laboratory
in ice and processed within the same day of sample collection.

Sample Processing
The standardized and published protocol by Chai et al. (2007)
and Tang et al. (2009) was used for sample processing. A 10 g
portion of the sample was aseptically placed in a stomacher bag
containing 90 mL Bolton broth base (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt,
Germany) and homogenized using a stomacher lab-blender
(Interscience, France) at normal speed for 60 s. The Bolton
broth was supplemented with Bolton broth selective supplement
contained Vancomycin, Cefoperazone, Trimethoprim Lactate
and Amphotericin B (Merck KGaA) and 5% lysed horse blood.

Control samples were prepared only with supplemented
Bolton broth and inoculated with C. jejuni ATCC 33221 and
C. coli ATCC 33559. The controls and samples were incubated
at 42◦C for 48 h under microaerophilic conditions comprised of
8–10% (v/v) CO2 and 5–6% (v/v) O2 generated by the Anaerocult
C system (Merck KGaA) in an anaerobic jar.

Microbiological Isolation
After incubation, a loop full of the enriched sample was streaked
in duplicates onto modiﬁed charcoal-cefoperazone-deoxycholate
agar (mCCDA; Merck KGaA) with CCDA selective supplement
contained Cefoperazone and Amphotericin B (Merck KGaA) and
incubated microaerobically (Anaerocult C system; Merck KGaA)
for 48 h at 42◦C. Presumptive identiﬁcation of Campylobacter
colonies was based on ISO method that includes (ISO, 2006a,b);
oxidase test, catalase test, gram-staining and typical microscopic
Campylobacter morphology. The presumptive colonies were
conﬁrmed by using PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) assay.

MPN-Enrichment
Campylobacter cells were counted using the MPN method with
triplicate of three 10-fold dilution series prepared by transferring
100 µL of homogenized sample into 900 µL of Bolton broth
base (Merck KGaA) supplemented with Bolton broth selective
supplements. A control tube was prepared with supplemented
Bolton broth and inoculated with C. jejuni ATCC 33221 and
C. coli ATCC 33559. The MPN tubes were incubated at 42◦C
for 48 h under microaerophilic conditions generated by the
Anaerocult C system (Merck KGaA) in an anaerobic jar.

Campylobacter in Cattle and Beef Meat in Malaysia

DNA Extraction
Bacterial DNA was extracted from the enriched sample tubes and
presumptive bacterial colonies using boiled-cell method (Tang
et al., 2009). Brieﬂy, enriched samples in the tubes were pelleted
by centrifuging at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was
carefully removed, next the pellet was washed once with 500 µL
sterile distilled water and harvested bacterial cells were suspended
in 500 µL of sterile TE buﬀer (pH 8.0). Bacterial cells were lysed
by subjecting to boiling for 10 min, followed by rapid cooling at
−20◦C for 10 min. Next the sample was centrifuged at 10,000 × g
for 10 min. Finally, the supernatant containing bacterial DNA
was stored at −20◦C until used in PCR.

PCR Identiﬁcation
All MPN tubes were subjected to identiﬁcation of Campylobacter
spp. by multiplex PCR reaction using primers speciﬁc for
Campylobacter genes, C. jejuni and C. coli (Table 1).

The PCR was carried out in 25 µL reactions, and each reaction
contained 5 µL of 5× PCR buﬀer (Promega, USA); 3 µL of
25 mM MgCl2 (Promega, USA); 1 U Taq Polymerase (Promega,
USA); 1 µL of 10 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) mix
(Promega, USA); 1 µM of forward and reverse primer (Sigma,
UK) and 5 µL of template DNA.

The cycling conditions were set as follows on the VeritiTM
96-Well Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, USA),
initial
denaturing at 94◦C for 4 min followed by 33 cycles of denaturing
at 94◦C for 1 min, annealing at 50◦C for 1 min and extension at
72◦C for 1 min followed by ﬁnal extension at 72◦C for 5 min.

The agarose gel was visualized under ultraviolet (UV) light
transilluminator (SynGene, Frederick, USA) and photographed.
In each gel a positive control, non-template control and a
DNA-molecular marker (100-bp ladder) (Vivantis Technologies,
Malaysia) were included. The DNA extracted from C. coli (ATCC
33559) and C. jejuni (ATCC 33560) were used as the positive
controls, while PCR mixture without DNA template was used as
the non-template control.

diﬀusion method (Bauer et al., 1966) and performed according
to the recommendations of the Clinical Laboratory Standards
Institute (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2012).

All isolates were revived from glycerol stocks using Bolton
broth supplemented with 5% lysed horse blood. The suspensions
were incubated for 48 h at 42◦C under microaerophilic
conditions. Revived cultures were grown in Brain heart infusion
(BHI: Merck KGaA) broth at 42◦C under microaerophilic
conditions for 24 h and the turbidity of the suspension was
adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard (Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute, 2012). Then the culture was swabbed
uniformly using sterile cotton swabs onto MH agar plates
(Merck KGaA) supplemented with 5% horse blood. The plates
were incubated under microaerophilic conditions (Anaerocult C
system; Merck KGaA) at 37◦C for 48 h. C. jejuni ATCC 33560 and
C. coli ATCC 33559 were used as reference strains.

The diameters of the inhibition zones around the antibiotic
disk were measured. The breakpoints used to categorize isolates
as susceptible (s), intermediate (i) and resistant (r) were based
on CLSI recommendations (Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute, 2012). As there were no CLSI recommendations
for Campylobacter
the standards assigned to the
Enterobacteriaceae family were used as breakpoints to interpret
Campylobacter resistance.

considered statistically signiﬁcant at P < 0.05 at 95% conﬁdence
level.

RESULTS

Culture-Based Detection and Colony
Conﬁrmation Applying PCR Method
Presumptive Campylobacter spp. were detected in 8% (8 of 100
samples) of the cattle feces samples and 1.6% (4 of 240) of the
beef meat samples and all presumptive isolates were conﬁrmed
as Campylobacter spp. by PCR.

MPN-Plating Media Based Enumeration
The prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in cattle and beef meat
samples determined by using the MPN-plating is presented in
Table 2. The MPN-plating detected Campylobacter spp. in 3.5%
of the total samples (Table 2). Campylobacter was detected only
in 8 out of 100 fecal samples, including C. jejuni in 5% and
C. coli in 2% of the fecal samples. The prevalence of C. jejuni was
signiﬁcantly higher (P ≤ 0.05) than the C. coli in fecal samples.

The majority (66%) of isolates were identiﬁed as C. jejuni and
the remainder as C. coli (34%). Campylobacter spp. were detected
only in 2% of the beef samples from wet and hypermarket by
the MPN-plating method. The MPN-plating found C. jejuni
and C. coli in 0.8% of beef samples from wet and hypermarket
(Table 2). The prevalence of Campylobacter spp. was statistically
not signiﬁcant (P ≤ 0.05) between the wet and hypermarkets.
However, the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in fecal samples
was signiﬁcantly higher (P ≤ 0.05) than that in beef samples.

MPN-PCR-Based Enumeration
The prevalence of Campylobacter spp determined by using the
MPN-PCR method is presented in Table 3. Based on the MPN-
PCR results Campylobacter spp. was detected in 59 (17.4%) of
the total 340 examined samples. Detection of Campylobacter
spp. by MPN-PCR method was signiﬁcantly higher (P ≤ 0.05)
comparative to the MPN-plating (Table 3).

The MPN-PCR method detected Campylobacter in 33 out
of 100 cattle fecal samples. According to the MPN-PCR, fecal
samples contained 16, 8, and 5% of C. jejuni, both Campylobacter
spp. and C. coli respectively. The prevalence of C. jejuni was
signiﬁcantly higher (P ≤ 0.05) than the C. coli in fecal samples.

Campylobacter was detected in a total of 17/120 (14.2%) beef
from wet markets and in 9/120 (7.5%) beef from hypermarkets
(Table 3). The predominant species of Campylobacter detected in

beef samples from wet market (55%) was C. jejuni and remainder
was C. coli (20%) and other Campylobacter spp. (25%). Similarly,
at the hypermarket, C. jejuni was the most prevalent (67%)
while C. coli and other Campylobacter spp. were detected in
22 and 11% of the beef samples respectively. The prevalence of
Campylobacter spp. was statistically not signiﬁcant (P ≤ 0.05)
between the wet and hypermarkets.

Campylobacter

concentration in cattle

and beef was
enumerated using the MPN method (Table 4). The highest
number of Campylobacter found in fecal samples from cattle,
including 3-460 MPN/g of C. jejuni and 3-43 MPN/g of C. coli
and 3-75 MPN/g of other thermophilic Campylobacter spp. Beef
from wet markets observed to carry Campylobacter spp. in the
range of 3-75 MPN/g while the beef samples from hypermarkets
harbored low Campylobacter spp. concentration ranged from 3
to 15 MPN/g.

Antimicrobial Resistance Testing
Eleven antimicrobials named under the diﬀerent antimicrobial
groups were employed in this study to determine the resistance
of Campylobacter isolates. All the isolates were resistant at least
one or more antimicrobials (Table 5). Antimicrobial resistance
pattern among the tested Campylobacter spp. Indicated that
majority of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline (76.9%)
and ampicillin (69.2%). Least resistance was observed for
chloramphenicol
(7.6%), cephalothin (15.4%), ciproﬂoxacin
(15.4%) and gentamicin (15.4%).

The MAR index of Campylobacter species that were isolated
from the current study indicate in Table 6. Campylobacter species
exhibited 7 diﬀerent antibiotic resistant patterns with MAR
index ranging from 0.09 to 0.73. The highest MAR index was
0.73 and showed S, E, En, Na, Nor, Te, C, Amp resistant
pattern. Meanwhile, lowest MAR index of 0.09 was demonstrated
in isolates that indicate resistance to Te or Amp (Table 5).
Moreover, 53.8% of the isolates were resistant to the three or more
antimicrobials and demonstrated the Multi Drug Resistance
(MDR).

DISCUSSION

Though the prevalence of Campylobacter in chicken and
broilers was well documented in Malaysia; no or limited
information was available for Campylobacter in other animals
and food commodities, particularly for cattle and beef in the

prevalence, concentration and antimicrobial resistant proﬁles
of thermophilic Campylobacter species present in cattle fecal
samples and beef.

The overall prevalence of thermophilic Campylobacter spp.
in fecal samples of apparently healthy cattle was 33% (Table 2).
Findings of this study was similar to the previous ﬁndings
reported on prevalence level of Campylobacter spp. in cattle from
countries including; Japan (39.6%) (Haruna et al., 2013) and
Chile (35.9%) (Fernández and Hitschfeld, 2009). Sanad et al.
(2011) found only 19.2% prevalence level in samples collected
from feedlot, mature cows and bulls presented for slaughter
across USA. Meanwhile, low mean Campylobacter prevalence
level of 5.6% (Nonga et al., 2010) and 13.2% (Karikari et al.,
2017) was reported from Tanzania and Ghana respectively.
However, a study conducted in 5 diﬀerent states in the U.S.
reported a high prevalence (72.2%) of Campylobacter in feedlot
cattle (Tang et al., 2017). While, 75–83.3% Campylobacter
prevalence level was reported in dairy cattle from Lithuania
(Ramonaite et al., 2013). Therefore, this study also contributes
to prior discussions that cattle can act as a potential reservoir
for transmitting Campylobacter spp.
into the food system
(Karenlampi et al., 2007; Cha et al., 2017). In the present
study, C. jejuni (58.5%) was the predominantly isolated organism
in cattle followed by C. coli (31.7%), and other thermophilic
Campylobacter spp. The prevalence of C. jejuni and C. coli
detected in this study was consistent with previous studies

(Haruna et al., 2013). However, Karikari et al. (2017) reported
higher prevalence level of C. coli (47.8%) comparatively C. jejuni
was detected in 35.8% samples. Similarly, C. jejuni was detected
in 35.2% cattle feacal samples with a high prevelance of C. coli
(72.9%) (Sanad et al., 2011). However, Okunlade et al. (2015)
reported low C. coli prevalence (20.4%) level in rectal swabs
collected from cattle from Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. A study
conducted in Michigan, USA reported 69.2% prevalence level
for C.
jejuni (Cha et al., 2017). Other Campylobacter spp.
(0.09%) detected in this study needs to be further characterized.
Diﬀerences in the reported prevalence level can be resultant
due to geographical
location, sample size and method of
analysis.

The low contamination frequency of Campylobacter species
detected in beef in this study was in agreement with recent
studies. The Campylobacter prevalence of fresh beef samples
from Poland was 10.1% in Korsak et al. (2015), 16.2% in
retail ground beef from Saskatchewan, Canada (Trokhymchuk
et al., 2014) and 17.4% in whole beef cuts from retail shops
in USA (Vipham et al., 2012). Meanwhile, some studies
conducted previously could only detect very low Campylobacter
contamination level in beef, including 1.9% in Tanzania (Nonga
et al., 2010) and 3.3% in Belgium (Ghaﬁr et al., 2007). Chilling
reduce the surface humidity of red meat which can be related
to low prevalence level Campylobacter in beef compared to
chicken as Campylobacter is very sensitive to dehydration (Silva

fresh meat

et al., 2011). The current study detected high Campylobacter
prevalence in beef from wet markets (14.2%) comparative to
beef from hypermarkets (7.5%) can be associated with the
availability of
in the wet markets in Malaysia.
Fresh meat is sold without chilling in the wet markets as it
is considered fresh and succulent since it retains moisture.
This may facilitate the survival of Campylobacter on raw
red meat. Further, the low hygienic conditions in the wet
markets (Chamhuri and Batt, 2013) may also contribute to
the comparatively higher Campylobacter contamination rate
and increase the potential for cross contamination. Moreover,
no-abattoir slaughtering procedures (Marimuthu et al., 2015)
can also result in high contamination of beef in wet markets
with Campylobacter. We speculate that the main reason for
the diﬀerence of Campylobacter prevalence in cattle and
beef from various countries can be the result of diﬀerences
in sampling methods, storage duration, microbiological and
molecular methods employed. The results of this study indicate
that not only cattle but also beef can be a potential reservoir for
Campylobacter infection.

Findings of this study reported that Campylobacter spp. in
cattle range from 460-3 MPN/g, while a lower concentration
was detected in beef (29-3 MPN/g). Further this study was in
line with Nielsen (2002) who reported that mean Campylobacter
concentration in cattle feces was 126 MPN/g. A study conducted
by Stanley et al. (1998) observed a maximum of Campylobacter
the level of 6.3 × 107 MPN/g in cattle.
concentration at
Campylobacter concentration in cattle intestine can be lower than
that of broilers (Stanley and Jones, 2003). However, owed to a
very low infective dose of Campylobacter the reported prevalence
and concentration indicate the potential of contaminating beef
during slaughter procedure. Therefore, proper sanitary and food
safety measures should be implemented to ensure safety of
beef. Further, an upward trend was observed among Malaysian
consumers toward higher value meat such as beef and mutton
(Yeong-Sheng et al., 2008). Therefore, beef can be a potential
source of Campylobacter infection and need more attention
focused on improving safety.

due to the fastidious growth requirements and discrepancies
in biochemical tests (Nachamkin et al., 2008). Application of
molecular methods for identiﬁcation of foodborne pathogens has
increasingly used for food samples to complement conventional
microbiological methods owing to its rapid turnaround time
and sensitivity (Inglis and Kalischuk, 2003). In this study,
detection of Campylobacter
spp. using PCR method was
higher than plating on mCCDA agar. Previous studies on
the prevalence of
foodborne pathogens in food indicate a
diﬀerence between the ﬁndings through the molecular biological
methods comparative to ﬁndings of culturing methods (Inglis
and Kalischuk, 2003; Chai et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2009).

isolated from raw beef

The high resistance detected in Campylobacter

isolates
against tetracycline in the current study was consistent with
previously reported work. (Hong et al., 2007; Kashoma et al.,
2015). Hong et al. (2007) reported that 93.4% Campylobacter
strains from Korean beef samples were resistant to multiple
antimicrobials and detected high resistance to tetracycline
(94.6%). Campylobacter
in Iran
demonstrated the highest resistance to tetracycline (Rahimi
et al., 2013). Campylobacter resistance to the tetracycline was
mainly mediated through tet (O) plasmid (Pratt and Korolik,
2005) and worldwide 60–100% C.
jejuni and C. coli were
reported to carry tetracycline-resistant plasmids (Lee et al.,
1994; Kim et al., 2010). High resistance to tetracycline in
this study may be resultant due to tet (O) plasmid; however
Campylobacter isolates from Malaysia need further investigation
on prevalence and resistance proﬁle of
(O) plasmid.
Similar to ﬁndings from the current study, the majority of
the Campylobacter strains from food animals in Tanzania
were resistant to ampicillin (70.3%) (Kashoma et al., 2015).
Inherently resistance can be overserved in Campylobacter strains
to β-lactams including ampicillin (Engberg, 2006; Li et al.,
2007) which may be contributory to high ampicillin resistance
observed in this study. The high resistance to tetracycline
and ampicillin detected in this study could be associated
with frequent usage of those antimicrobials in humans and
animal husbandry (Chopra and Roberts, 2001; Hao et al.,
2014).

isolated from raw meat in Iran were resistant to gentamicin and
chloramphenicol 3.2 and 6.5%, respectively (Rahimi et al., 2013).
Contrary to the current study, Campylobacter isolates in beef
from Korea showed high resistant to ciproﬂoxacin (95.9%) and
nalidixic acid (94.6%) in Hong et al. (2007). Discrepancies and
similarities in antibiotic resistance patterns can be attributed
to variation in sample type, sampling procedure, type and
frequency of antibiotic usage in animal husbandry practices and
human therapy.

In the current study multiple antibiotic resistances was
detected only in 53.8% of the isolates. Slightly higher multiple
antibiotic resistance was observed in Campylobacter isolates
from broilers in Malaysia (Saleha, 2002) and beef liver from
USA (Noormohamed and Fakhr, 2014). The present study,
46.2% Campylobacter isolates reported to have a MAR less

Campylobacter in Cattle and Beef Meat in Malaysia

Health, Malaysia, more than 97 antimicrobials have been
registered for use in producing animals in Malaysia. However,
comparative to poultry, a lower number of products has been
registered to be used in cattle. The MAR index detected
in Campylobacter isolates from cattle and beef of this study
may be associated with low frequency of antibiotic usage in
cattle compared to poultry in Malaysia. However, multiple
antibiotic resistances associated with isolates from cattle and
beef exacerbate the public health concern associated with
Campylobacter infections.
