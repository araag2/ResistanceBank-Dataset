ABSTRACT 26 The presence and molecular characteristics of carbapenemase-producing 27 Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) among meat products in China were investigated. A total 28 of 110 CRE isolates，including 94 Escherichia coli and 10 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 29 were identified from 105 (13.2%) out of 794 samples. The positive rates markedly 30 increased from 2016 (9.4%) to 2018 (22.2%). Only blaNDM genes were detected, 79.1% 31 blaNDM genes were carried by IncX3 plasmids. Routine monitoring of 32 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in animal-food supply is highly 33 recommended. 34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47 l

 48 Last decades have witnessed the rapid increase of carbapenem-resistant 49 Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and the threat of limited treatment options, which are 50 mainly attributed to carbapenemase enzymes, especially Klebsiella pneumoniae 51 carbapenemase (KPC) and New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) (1, 2). Before 52 2014, the prevalence of CRE remained low in animals and environment, and existence 53 of carbapenemase producers in food products was unavailable (1, 3). However, the 54 last few years have gradually seen CRE in animals and food (4, 5). In China, multiple 55 studies have demonstrated the increasing occurrence of CRE, mainly NDM-producing 56 Enterobacteriaceae, in livestock, pets, and environment. However, little is known 57 about their prevalence or molecular characteristics in meat products (4, 6, 7). In this 58 study, the prevalence and molecular epidemiological features of CRE in retail meat 59 from food markets in Guangzhou were evaluated.  60 Between 2016 and 2018, 794 fresh retail meat samples (512 pork, 222 chicken, 61 and 60 beef samples) were collected twice a year from farmer’s markets and 62 supermarkets in 7 districts of Guangzhou, China (Table 1, Figure S1). 63 Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates were selected by MacConkey agar 64 containing 1 μg/ml imipenem. Colonies with different morphologies were selected 65 from each positive sample of carbapenemase genes (blaNDM, blaKPC, blaIMP, blaVIM, 66 and blaOXA-48–like) (8, 9) and only different species, identified by MALDI-TOF-MS or 67 16S rRNA sequencing, were retained. In total, 110 non-duplicate 68 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates were recovered from 105 69 l

(13.2%) samples (64 pork, 38 chicken, and 3 beef samples) (Table 1), with results 70 showing that 110 isolates harboured 98 blaNDM-5, 11 blaNDM-1, and 1 blaNDM-7, which 71 was in accordance with studies on farm animals in China (4, 6, 7). The carriage rates 72 of CRE in chicken samples (17.1%, 38/222) were higher than those of pork (12.5%, 73 64/512) and beef samples (5.0%, 3/60). According to the annual isolation of pork and 74 chicken samples, we found that the prevalence of CRE among chicken and pork 75 samples increased significantly (P < 0.05) from 2016 to 2018 (9.4%, 34/360 in 2016, 76 11.1%,15/135 in 2017, and 22.2%, 53/239 in 2018). The high frequency of CRE in 77 retail meat (13.2%, 105/794) and the increased prevalence in pork and chicken were 78 worrying. Between 2013 and 2017, CRE was reported in pigs, chickens, and cows in 79 China, with various detection rates (6.5–61.0%) (6, 7). Additionally, CREs were also 80 detected in chickens and pigs at slaughterhouses (4). Data from the China 81 Antimicrobial Surveillance Network (CHINET) revealed that the rate of carbapenem 82 resistance in K. pneumoniae increased from 9.3% in 2011 to 20.9% in 2017, whereas 83 in E. coli, the rate was maintained at 1.0–1.9% over this period (10). Thus, it seemed 84 that CREs detected in retail meat samples might mainly be attributable to 85 contamination from livestock during slaughter but not from human activity and 86 hospital waste.   87 According to the CLSI guidelines (11) and epidemiological cut-off (ECOFF) 88 values or clinical breakpoints of EUCAST (http://www.eucast.org), all 110 isolates 89 showed resistant to ampicillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefoxitin (Figure S2). 90 Resistant genes, including mcr-1~8, rmtB, fosA3, floR, and blaCTX-M, were screened 91 l

by PCR and sequencing, as described previously (Table S1). Twenty-one (19.1%) 92 isolates co-produced CTX-M enzymes, 94 (85.5%) carried the floR gene (Table S2). 93 In addition, 20, 16, and 3 isolates showed resistance to colistin, fosfomycin and 94 amikacin, while 16, 14, and 3 were positive for mcr-1, fosA3, and rmtB, respectively, 95 and no other mcr genes were detected. Interestingly, the mcr-1 positive rates of the 96 110 isolates decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from 2016 (24.3%, 9/37), to 2017 97 (13.3%, 2/15), and to 2018 (8.6%, 5/58). Furthermore, 103 isolates were sensitive to 98 tigecycline (Table S2).  99 The 94 NDM-producing E. coli isolates belong to 51 distinct STs, ST10 (n = 12) 100 and ST48 (n = 13) were the most prevalent STs, followed by ST7111 (n = 4) (Figure 101 1 and Table S2). Previous report pointed out the dominance of blaNDM-positive E. coli 102 ST48 clones in one pig farm in China (7). ST10, ST48, ST117, ST2732, ST5229, 103 ST746, ST119 and ST93 (Table S2) were detected in multiple years. PFGE analysis 104 was performed on the same ST clone. In total, 10 and 8 different PFGE patterns were 105 observed among 12 ST10 strains and 13 ST48 strains, respectively (Figure S3a, 106 Figure S3b). Among the 10 K. pneumoniae isolates carrying blaNDM, 8 STs were 107 detected, with ST1 (n = 3) being dominant, and had indistinguishable PFGE patterns 108 (Figure S3c). Thus, non-clonal dissemination played a vital role in the spread of 109 NDM-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains from retail meat in China despite the 110 occasional clonal spread. Most of the characterized STs were different from those of 111 human source in China. Yet, there were clones sharing by isolates from humans and 112 retail meat, such as E. coli ST10, ST167, ST410, ST641, ST744, and ST5229, and K. 113 l

pneumoniae ST1, ST11, ST35, and ST45 (16, 17, 18). 114 Conjugation and transformation experiments were performed on 52 NDM 115 producers collected in 2016–2017. All 52 blaNDM plasmids were successfully 116 transferred to recipients (E. coli C600str or DH5α) by conjugation or transformation. 117 PCR-based replicon typing was performed on transconjugants/transformants as 118 previously described (12-14). The replicon types included IncX3 (n=50), F2:A-:B- 119 (n=1), and untypable (n=1) (Table 1). For the 58 NDM-producing isolates collected in 120 2018, S1-PFGE and hybridization analyses confirmed that blaNDM genes from 37 121 isolates were located on ~50 kb plasmids and the others were located on 60–270 kb 122 plasmids or chromosome. The ~50 kb plasmids carrying blaNDM were confirmed to be 123 IncX3 type by using primers covering both the backbone of IncX3 plasmid and 124 blaNDM genes. Totally, among the 110 NDM producers, 87 (79.1%) blaNDM genes were 125 carried by IncX3 plasmids (Table S2), which was consistent with previous reports that 126 IncX3 plasmid was a major vector driving the transmission of blaNDM (7, 16, 17, 19). 127 IncX3 plasmid was firstly associated with the dissemination of blaNDM-1 among 128 clinical CRE strains (20). Nowadays, it has disseminated in 23 countries, mostly in 129 Asian countries, and was harbored by diverse Enterobacteriaceae species (Figure S5) 130 (17). The wide distribution of blaNDM/IncX3 plasmids might be explained by their 131 ability to transfer among different bacterial species at a wide range of temperatures 132 (30°C-37°C) (17). However, further studies are needed to investigate the underlying 133 mechanism and driving force. 134 Genomic DNA of 22 blaNDM-positive isolates was extracted and subjected to 135 l

sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. To obtain the complete sequence of 136 9 IncX3 plasmid and analyze genetic backgrounds of other blaNDM gens carried by 137 IncX3, we designed customized primers (Table S3) based on plasmid pNDM5_IncX3 138 (GenBank accession no. KU761328.1), a 46,161-bp IncX3 plasmid from K. 139 pneumoniae (15). BLAST analysis indicated that 9 IncX3 plasmids carrying blaNDM-5 140 were highly similar (≥99%) to pNDM5_IncX3. Of note, the sequences of pHNYX638 141 (MK033577) showed 100% similarity and query coverage with pNDM5_IncX3 142 (Figure S4). pHNHZB05, pHNYX658, pHNHZ11, pHNYX644, pHNHZ18, and 143 pHNYX667 were almost identical to pNDM5_IncX3 with only 1–5 nucleotide 144 differences in plasmid backbones (pHNHZ18) or mobile modules. A total of 7 genetic 145 contexts (type I to type VII) were found in 87 blaNDM/IncX3 plasmids, which were 146 due to insertions, truncation, and/or deletions of mobile elements (Figure 2, Table S2). 147 Type I was the most common structure in this study (81.6%, 71/87) and GenBank 148 database, encoded by IncX3 plasmids from Enterobacteriaceae of human, pig, and 149 chicken sources in China and other countries (Table S2, Figure 2 and Figure S5). Type 150 III was found in 3 blaNDM-1-carrying K. pneumoniae and E. aerogenes, and was 151 identical to pCRENT-193_2 (CP024814) from Enterobacteriaceae of an inpatient in 152 South Korea. Type II, IV, V, VI, and VII were all novel genetic structures found in this 153 study and were unique in the GenBank database.  154 A dramatic increase of CRE in retail meat samples was observed, driven by the 155 prevailing blaNDM-5/IncX3 plasmid. The CRE and NDM-producing plasmids in retail 156 meat might originate from livestock and endanger public health via direct contact, 157 l

food chain, and environment. It is likely that blaNDM-5/IncX3 might further spread via 158 international travel and trade, as observed in ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae 159 (21). From the one health perspective, more extensive surveillance and development 160 of multisectoral strategies to control its dissemination are urgently needed. 161 Statistical analysis 162 To compare the prevalence of CRE and mcr-1, χ2-test was performed using spss 163 version 23.0 . P ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. 164 Accession number 165 The complete IncX3 plasmid sequences carrying blaNDM-5 obtained in this study 166 have been deposited in the GenBank database under the following accession numbers: 167 MK033578, MK033584, MK033580, MK033583, MK033581, MK033579, 168 MK033577, and MK088486. 169 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 170 This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of 171 China (No. 31625026, 81661138002 and 81772238).
