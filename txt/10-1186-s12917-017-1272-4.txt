Abstract

Background: Staphylococcus aureus is an important zoonotic pathogen which not only causes significant economic
loss in livestock production but also poses a potential threat to public health. Compared with bovine and swine,
the information on the colonization of S. aureus in goats is very limited. To understand the prevalence and
characteristics of S. aureus in goats, we used the nasal swabs collected from apparently healthy goats to
isolate S. aureus, and tested their antimicrobial susceptibility, virulence gene carrying levels, and multilocus
sequence typing (MLST).
Results: In 74 nasal swabs of apparently healthy goats, 32 (43.24%) S. aureus strains were isolated and identified, most
of which were susceptible to many antibiotics, except for trimethoprim, furazolidone, amoxicillin, lincomycin and
roxithromycin, and the resistance incidence of which were 50%, 40.63%, 37.5%, 28.13%, and 21.88% respectively. All the
isolates were methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and mecA-negative. Enterotoxin genes were found in 53.13% of
the strains. Of which, sej was the most prevalent (21.88%), followed by seb, sec, and see with the same level (18.75%).
The most prevalent combination were seb + see and seb + tst. None of the S. aureus isolates harbored sea, sed, seh, eta
and etb. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) revealed 6 new alleles (aroe-552, aroe-553, glpf-500, pta-440, yqil-482 and
yqil-496) and 5 new sequence types (STs) (3431,3440,3444,3445 and 3461). Using eBURST, the 5 STs were assigned to
clonal complex 522 (CC522) and a further CC with no predicted ancestor. Phylogenetic analysis of seven concatenated
MLST alleles revealed that the 5 STs were grouped into cluster I composed of S. aureus mainly from goats and sheep.
Conclusion: We provide the data for prevalence of S. aureus in goats in Chongqing municipality and their
characterization which will help in tracking evolution of epidemic strains and their control methods.

Background
Staphylococcus aureus is an important opportunistic
pathogen and the cause of
infection among human,
domestic and wild animals [1–3]. Due to its broad
spectrum of inherent virulence factors, the infection of
S. aureus usually plays an important role for the causing
of abscesses, mastitis, pneumonia and meningitis in

mammals [4–6]. The invasion of S. aureus in domestic
animals not only causes significant economic loss in live-
stock production but also poses a potential threat to
public health since these animals can act as the reservoir
of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) [7, 8]. The
livestock-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (LA-
MRSA) represented by clonal complex 398 (CC 398)
have been shown to be able to colonize and cause
serious infections in people having close contact with
animals such as veterinarians, farmers and their family
members [9–11]. In addition, both handling and con-
sumption of products of these animals colonized by
MRSA may provide a potential transmission to humans

lence and characterization of S. aureus colonizing the
livestock.

In contrast to the studies of S. aureus infections in bo-
vine and human, less is known on these bacteria in goats
or their relevant products. In 2008, Chongqing munici-
pality was incorporated into the national "Advantage of
agricultural products regional planning" in China and
recognized as the key areas for beef cattle and goats
breeding. The number of live sheep and goats in Chongqing
was about 2.26 million and 2.74 million slaughtered was
provided by the end of 2015 (Chongqing Statistical
Yearbook, 2016). However, there is no investigation on the

incidences of colonization in goats by S. aureus
in
Chongqing. To understand the prevalence and characteris-
tics of S. aureus in goats, we used the nasal swabs from ap-
parently healthy goats to isolate S. aureus, tested their
antimicrobial susceptibility and virulence gene carrying
levels, and defined multilocus sequence typing (MLST).

Methods
Sample collection and S. aureus isolation
The nasal swabs were collected from 74 apparently
healthy goats from 10 herds in 4 counties (Rongchang,
Jiangjing, Zhongxian and Dazu) of Chongqing munici-
pality, transported to the laboratory and stored at 4 °C
prior to isolation. The bacteria were enriched in a com-
mon broth at 37 °C for 18 h, and then inoculated on
7.5% NaCl agar plates for cultivation at 37 °C for 24 h.
The colonies suspected to be S. aureus were identified
by Gram staining, colony morphology, and coagulase

testing. All the presumptive S. aureus colonies were then
subcultured and confirmed by the PCR amplification of
nuc (a thermonuclease gene characteristic of S. aureus)
[13] (Table 1) with the following conditions: denatur-
ation for 4 min at 94 °C, followed by 30 cycles for 1 min
at 94 °C, 30 s at 58 °C and 90 s at 72 °C, and a final ex-
tension at 72 °C for 3.5 min. S. sciuri was used as nuc-
negative control strain.

Antimicrobial resistance profile
The S. aureus
isolates were used for antimicrobial
susceptibility test using disk diffusion method according
to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines [14]. Following antibiotics with stated concen-
trations (μg/disc) were used: cefotaxime (30), ceftriaxone
(30),
streptomycin (10),kanamycin (30), gentamicin
(10),tetracycline (30), chloramphenicol (30),lincomycin
(2), macrodantin (300),furazolidone (300), vancomycin
(30), norfloxacin (10),minocyline (30), amoxicillin (10),
cefoxitin (30),clarithromycin (15),
levofloxacin (5),roxi-
thromycin (15),trimethoprim (5) and cefepime (30). The
presence of mecA (staphylococci methicillin resistance
gene) [15] (Table 1) was analyzed by PCR method under
the same amplification conditions as stated earlier for

The bold-italic numbers indicate new alleles or STs

for PCR with the following amplification conditions:
initial denaturation for 5 min at 94 °C, followed by 30 cy-
cles of 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min (55 °C for seg
and pvl), and 72 °C for 1 min, with a final elongation of
72 °C for 10 min. S. aureus reference strains including
ATCC 25923 (pvl positive) and ATCC 29213 (sea, sec, see
and tst positive).

Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of S. aureus
A random selection of 13 S. aureus isolates were ana-
lyzed by MLST. The 7 housekeeping genes, carbamate
kinase (arcc), shikimate dehydrogenase (aroe), glycerol
kinase (glpf ), guanylate kinase (gmk), phosphate ace-
tyltransferase (pta),
triosephosphate isomerase (tpi),
and acetyl coenzyme A acetyltransferase (yqil) (http://

saureus.mlst.net/misc/info.asp), were amplified by PCR
method consisting of initial denaturation at 95 °C for
5 min, followed by a total of 35 cycles of 30 s de-
naturation at 94 °C, 30 s annealing at 55 °C, and
1 min elongation at 72 °C, with a final elongation
step of 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were se-
quenced both in forward and reverse directions by
Shanghai Invitrogen Biotechnology Co., Ltd. The se-
quences for each locus were compared to the allele
sequences
(http://
www.mlst.net). Isolates were defined by their alleles at
the seven loci (allelic profile), and each allelic profile
was submitted to the database to obtain a sequence

Clonal complexes (CCs) clustering and phylogenetic
analysis of S. aureus STs
The clustering of STs was performed using eBURST al-
gorithm (http://eburst.mlst.net/) [21] by comparing the
present dataset to that of the MLST database of 4066
STs by the end of May 2017, and ran with the default
settings. Clonal complexes (CCs) were composed of STs
that shared at least six alleles in common and a pre-
dicted ancestral ST and its associated single locus vari-
ants (SLVs: the variants differ at one of the seven MLST
alleles from the ancestor) and double locus variants
(DLVs: the variants differ at two of the seven MLST al-
leles from the ancestor) [3]. Along with the STs obtained
in this research, 23 STs from human (ST7, 12,13, 15, 27,
88, 101 and 240), goats and sheep (ST130, 133, 398, 425,

2305, 2328) [2, 9, 22, 23] were collected for phylogenetic
analyses. The concatenated sequences of all seven MLST
alleles for each ST were aligned using the CLUSTAL X
program with default parameters followed by manual in-
spection. MEGA 4.0 was used to construct neighbour-

Results
Isolation and identification of S. aureus
Of 74 nasal swabs of goats collected from 10 herds, 32
(43.24%) were identified as S. aureus through nuc ampli-
fication (Fig. 1), and all the S. aureus isolates were found
to be coagulase positive.

Antimicrobial resistance profile
The antimicrobial susceptibility test showed most of the
S. aureus isolates susceptible to a majority of antibiotics
and the resistance rates below 20%, with the exceptions
of following: trimethoprim (50% resistant), furazolidone
(40.63%), amoxicillin (37.5%), lincomycin (28.13%), and
roxithromycin (21.88%) (Table 2). All the isolates (n =
32) were methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and
cefoxitin-susceptible.

Distribution of virulence genes among S. aureus isolates
Since every S. aureus carries several virulence genes, but
here 19/32 strains carried at least one of the small
chosen set of virulence genes (Fig. 2). Enterotoxin genes
were detected in majority (53.13%) of the strains, and sej
gene was found in 7 (21.88%), followed by seb, sec and
see in 18.75% isolates each, sei (9.38%), seg (3.13%). In
addition, both tst gene and pvl gene were detected in 6
(18.75%) isolates. The most prevalent combination was
determined to be seb + see and seb + tst in 12.5% of all
isolates (Table 3). There were 8 isolates which only en-
code a virulence gene.

MLST analysis
After MLST analysis, 6 new alleles (aroe-552, aroe-553,
glpf-500, pta-440,yqil-482 and yqil-496) and 5 new STs
(ST 3431,ST 3440,ST 3444,ST 3445 and ST 3461) were
identified and added to the S. aureus MLST database
(Table 4). The dominant type of aroE was aroE-552,
which was present in 92.31% (12/13) of S. aureus iso-
and yqiL-496, which
lates,

followed by pta-440

Page 6 of 8

accounted for 69.23% (9/13) and 61.54% (8/13) respect-
ively. The ST3444 was the most common ST type which
accounted for 61.54% (8/13) of the S. aureus isolates,
followed by ST3445 (2 strains), and ST 3431, ST 3440,
ST 3461 which just had one strain.

Clonal complexes (CCs) clustering and phylogenetic
analysis of S. aureus STs
eBURST generated 103 groups and 483 singletons. The
S. aureus isolates tested in this study were clustered into
CC522 containing ST3440 and ST3445, and a further
CC with no predicted ancestor containing ST3431 and
ST3444, while ST3461 was a singleton (Fig. 3). The
phylogenetic
on
concatenated sequences of seven MLST alleles, resulted
in two main clusters: clusterI(mainly from goats and
sheep) and cluster II (from humans). In clusterI, there
were three sub-clusters (SCs) (SC1 containing ST130,
522, 1740, 1742, 1758, 2011, 3440, 3445 and 3461; SC2
containing ST133, 425, 1743, 1780, 1781, 2305 and 2328;
SC3 containing ST 398, 1595, 3431 and 3444) (Fig. 4).

Discussion
This is the first study of the prevalence of S. aureus from
the nose swabs of apparently healthy goats in Chong-
qing. Our results were comparable to the carriage fre-
quency of S. aureus in healthy sheep in Tunisia [25]
approaching to ~ 45% level, which were higher than re-
ported by other investigators in dairy sheep and goats
[26–28], but lower than that in goats in Norway and
Denmark [22, 29].

It is interesting that all the S. aureus isolates in this
study were methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) since
they were sensitive or medium sensitivity to cefoxitin and
mecA tested negative. The majority of S. aureus showed
relatively low resistance to vancomycin, ceftriaxone,
macrodantin, streptomycin, kanamycin, tetracycline, gen-
tamicin, cefotaxime and cefepime, which is similar to the
resistance of S. aureus isolated from sheep and goat in
Spain [23], but lower than the resistance of S. aureus from
goats in Taiwan [26]. The relatively high sensitivity
spectrum of S. aureus from Chongqing is likely due to a
limited use of antimicrobials for goats [28].

The infections caused by S. aureus is associated with its
virulence factors which allow it to adhere to surface, in-
vade or avoid the immune system, and cause harmful
toxic effects to the host [30, 31]. More than half of isolates
in this study were tested positive for SE genes, which is
similar to other reports in S. aureus from dairy goats [29]
and their milk products [32], and higher than the result in
goats and cows affected with mastitis [33]. Of the SE
genes tested, sej was the most predominantly occurring
gene which is different from the detection rates in goats
from Taiwan or sheep in Tunisia where there were no sej

occurrence [25, 26]. Except for sej, the seb, sec, see, tst and
pvl carriage rate of 18.75% is similar to the other reports
in S. aureus from goats and their milk products [26, 32,
34, 35] but lower than sec and tst found in S. aureus from
dairy goats [29], or in MSSA from sheep [25]. In contrast
to the other report [29], although sec and tst showed the
same detection rates, they were not always co-detected. In
the previous study, see was identified only in S. aureus as-
sociated with mastitis in goat [26], the carry level of seb
and see in this study are inconsistent with other reports
[32, 35] where there were no S. aureus strain harboured
seb and see. Pvl is associated with S. aureus causing goat
subclinical mastitis [36]. Different from the previous re-
port [25], we found 18.75% isolates pvl-positive.

To understand the molecular characteristics of S. aur-
eus isolates from Chongqing goats, we used MLST
typing and found 6 new alleles (aroe-552, aroe-553, glpf-
500, pta-440,yqil-482 and yqil-496) and 5 new STs
(3431,3440,3444,3445 and 3461). The dominant alleles
belonged to aroE was aroE-552, which occurred in most
of S. aureus strains, followed by pta-440 and yqiL-496.
In the newly found STs, ST3444 was the most common,
which occurred in approximately 60% of the S. aureus
isolates. It is relatively normal for S. aureus from goats
to possess novel alleles or STs in contrast to human or
bovine strains, which may be simply due to the investi-
gation of a new population, since most reports have fo-
cused on human clinical isolates or bovine mastitis [37].
The eBURST analyses assigned S. aureus isolates to
CC522 containing ST3440 and ST3445, and a further
CC with no predicted ancestor. The results from phylo-
genetic analyses showed that STs from goats and sheep
were separated from that of human, thus formed two
main clusters. Three new STs (ST3440, 3445 and 3461)
were sub-grouped in the branch of SC1 containing
ST522, the primary founder ST of CC522, which was re-
ported previously from cases of goat mastitis or goat’s
milk samples [2, 3, 23]. ST3444, the predominate ST in
this study, and ST3431 were sub-clustered into the
branch SC3 containing ST398, which is associated with
animals infection [9]. In SC2, ST133 was found in variety
of animals including cows, goats and sheep [2, 3, 22, 23],
and was found to be the most common animal-associated
MLST type [3]. Our results confirmed the relative close
relationship of ST 3440, ST3445 and ST3461 with ST522,
and ST3444, ST3431 with ST398.

Conclusion
This is the first study to report the prevalence rate, anti-
microbial resistance profile, virulence genes association
and MLST characteristics of S. aureus from goats in
Chongqing municipality. This study will help in tracking
evolution of S. aureus epidemic strains and proving the
methods to control S. aureus in goats in China.
