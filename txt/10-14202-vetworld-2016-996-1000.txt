Abstract

Aim:  To  assess  the  prevalence  of  antimicrobial  resistance  producing  extended-spectrum  β-lactamases  (ESBL)  (blaTEM, 
blaSHV, and blaCTX-M) genes in Escherichia coli isolated from chicken meat, chevon meat, raw milk, and human urine and 
stool samples collected from tribal districts of Chhattisgarh, viz., Jagdalpur, Dantewada, Kondagaon, and Kanker.
Materials and Methods: A total of 330 samples, comprising 98 chicken meat, 82 chevon meat, 90 raw milk, and 60 human 
urine and stool samples, were processed for isolation of E. coli. Isolates were confirmed biochemically and further tested 
against commonly used antibiotics to know their resistant pattern. The resistant isolates were tested for ESBL production 
by phenotypic method followed by characterization with molecular method using multiplex-polymerase chain reaction 
technique.
Results:  Overall  57.87%  (191/330)  samples  were  found  positive  for  E.  coli,  which  include  66.32%  (65/98)  chicken 
meat, 46.34% (38/82) chevon meat, 81.11% (73/90) raw milk, and 25% (15/60) human urine and stool samples. Isolates 
showed the highest resistance against cefotaxime (41.36%) followed by oxytetracycline (34.03%), ampicillin (29.31%), 
cephalexin (24.60%), cefixime (16.75%), and ceftazidime (13.08%). Phenotypic method detected 10.99% (21/191) isolates 
as presumptive ESBL producers, however, molecular method detected 3.66% (7/191), 2.09% (4/191), and 0.00% (0/191) 
prevalence of blaTEM, blaCTX-M, and blaSHV, respectively.
Conclusion: The present study indicates a high prevalence of E. coli in raw chicken meat, chevon meat, and milk due to 
poor hygienic practices. The antibiotic susceptibility test detected the presence of the resistance pattern against ESBL in 
E. coli isolated from raw chicken meat, chevon meat, milk, and also in human clinical samples is of great concern. The 
appearance of E. coli in the human food chain is alarming and requires adaptation of hygienic practices and stipulate use of 
antibiotics.

Food-borne  diseases  remain  a  major  public 
health  problem  across  the  globe.  Moreover,  the  sit-
uation  worsens  in  developing  countries  like  India 
due to difficulties in securing optimal hygienic food 
handling  practices.  Most  of  the  bacterial  pathogens 
associated with human enteric illness originate from 
animals and can be transmitted directly from animals 
to humans or indirectly through foods of animal ori-
gin, contaminated water, etc. [1,2]. Among the genus 
Enterobacter,  Escherichia coli is mainly responsible 
for causing diarrhea, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and

hemorrhagic colitis (HC) [3]. E. coli can contaminate 
the foods of animal origin, viz., raw milk, meat, and 
their  products  and  contribute  to  human  food-borne 
diseases and food spoilage. E. coli also causes nosoco-
mial infections especially meningitis in infants. More 
than 85% of urinary tract infections are attributed to 
this organism [4]. Several strains of E. coli are recog-
nized as important pathogens responsible for causing 
severe human diseases such as HC and hemolytic ure-
mic syndrome [5].

Nowadays, curing bacterial infections in human 
and  veterinary  medicine  is  facing  several  problems 
due  to  increased  antimicrobial  resistance  (AMR)  in 
bacteria against the most of the antibacterial agents. 
The intensive use and, particularly, the misuse of anti-
biotics have led to the development and selection of 
resistant bacteria in different settings. One of the most 
important  AMR  mechanisms  in  Enterobacteriaceae 
family  is  production  of  extended-spectrum  β-lac-
tamase  (ESBL)  enzymes.  According  to  Ambler

classification, ESBL is divided into four main groups 
from  A  to  D  [6].  ESBL  enzymes  TEM,  SHV,  and 
CTX-M from Group A have been widely reported to 
be produced by E. coli. These enzymes can hydrolyze 
ampicillin,  carbenicillin,  oxacillin,  and  an  extended 
spectrum of cephalosporins such as ceftazidime and 
cefotaxime [7].

The emergence of ESBL producing E. coli in the 
food-producing animals and in foods of animal origin 
is a growing problem worldwide [8]. There are scanty 
reports animals and on the association of ESBL pro-
ducing enteric bacteria in humans and foods of ani-
mal  origin  in  India  as  in  the  state  of  Chhattisgarh. 
Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the 
occurrence of ESBL-producing E. coli in foods of ani-
mal origin and human clinical samples from different 
districts of Chhattisgarh, India.
Materials and Methods
Ethical approval

Live animals were not used in this study, so eth-
ical approval was not necessary. Meat samples were 
collected from retail meat shops, and human clinical 
samples were collected from hospitals, private clinics, 
and diagnostic centers.
Sample collection

A  total  of  330  samples  comprising  of  chicken 
meat, chevon meat, raw milk, and human urine and 
stool  were  collected  randomly  during  August  2014 
to  July  2015  from  Jagdalpur,  Dantewada,  Kanker, 
and Kondagaon districts of Chhattisgarh, India. The 
chicken  meat  (n=98)  and  chevon  meat  (n=82)  sam-
ples  were  aseptically  collected  from  retail  meat 
shops  and  slaughter  houses  as  per  the  guidelines  of 
the  International  Commission  on  Microbiological 
Specifications  for  Foods  [9].  Raw  milk  samples 
(n=90) were aseptically collected from hotels/restau-
rants using sterile milk sample bottles. All milk sam-
ples were stored at 4°C and were cultured within 5 h. 
Human  urine  (n=56)  and  stool  samples  (n=4)  were 
collected  from  hospitals,  private  clinics,  and  diag-
nostic centers. Human patients suffering from urinary 
tract infection were given dry test tube and requested 
to  provide  10-20  ml  urine  sample  for  examination. 
The human stool samples were collected using steril-
ized dry absorbent cotton swab following the protocol 
of Cheesbrough [10].
Isolation and biochemical characterization

Isolation was carried out as per method described 
by Agarwal et al. [11]. Briefly, 10 g of raw chicken 
and  chevon  meat,  1  ml  of  raw  milk,  1  g  of  human 
stool, and 1 ml of human urine samples were taken 
and  inoculated  in  sterilized  MacConkey’s  lactose 
broth  (HiMedia,  India)  and  incubated  at  37°C  for 
24 h. Thereafter, a loop-full culture from enrichment 
broth was taken and streaked onto MacConkey’s lac-
tose agar (HiMedia, India) and incubated at 37°C for 
24 h. The suspected E. coli colonies, pink to red were 
picked  up  and  further  streaked  on  eosin  methylene

blue agar (HiMedia, India) and incubated at 37°C for 
24  h.  Dark-centered  and  flat  colonies  with  metallic 
sheen were considered as E. coli. All the E. coli iso-
lates  were  further  confirmed  by  indole,  methyl  red, 
Voges–Proskauer, and citrate utilization biochemical 
tests.
Antimicrobial susceptibility test and multiple antibi-
otic resistance (MAR) index

All  biochemically  confirmed  E.  coli  isolates 
were  tested  for  their  antimicrobial  drug  susceptibil-
ity pattern on Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) (HiMedia, 
India) by the disc diffusion method [12]. The antibi-
otics  used  were  oxytetracycline  (30  μg),  cephalexin 
(30  μg),  ciprofloxacin  (5  μg),  gentamicin  (30  μg), 
cefotaxime  (10  μg),  ampicillin  (10  μg),  ceftazidime 
(30 μg), aztreonam (30 μg), imipenem (10 μg), cefix-
ime (5 μg), and meropenem (10 μg) (HiMedia, India). 
The diameter of the zones of complete inhibition was 
measured and compared with the zone size interpreta-
tion chart and was graded as sensitive, intermediate, 
and resistant. The MAR Index was also calculated for 
all E. coli isolates, by applying formula a/b where “a” 
is the number of antibiotics to which an isolate was 
resistant and “b” is the number of antibiotics to which 
the isolates exposed [13].
Phenotypic detection of ESBL producers

As  per  CLSI  protocol,  E.  coli  isolates  with  a 
zone of inhibition of ≤17 mm for aztreonam and cef-
tazidime, and ≤22 mm for cefotaxime in disc diffusion 
susceptibility  testing  were  selected  for  detection  of 
ESBLs production. For this purpose, four antibiotics 
cefotaxime (10 μg), ceftazidime (30 μg), aztreonam 
(30 μg), and cefotaxime+clavulanic acid (30+10 μg) 
(HiMedia, India) were used. Discs were placed on the 
inoculated MHA plates at a distance of 25 mm apart 
and incubated overnight. The E. coli isolates resistant 
to either of the cephalosporin discs and sensitive to 
their  respective  cephalosporin+clavulanic  acid  discs 
with diameter of more than 5 mm were considered as 
presumptive ESBL producers [13].
Molecular characterization of ESBL-encoding genes
All the presumptive ESBL producing E. coli iso-
lates were screened for the detection of blaTEM, blaSHV, 
and  blaCTX-M  genes  by  multiplex-polymerase  chain 
reaction (m-PCR) as described by Monstein et al. [14] 
with some modifications. Template DNA incorporated 
in PCR reactions was prepared by boiling and snap 
chill method as outlined by Nagappa et al. [15]. Purity 
and  concentration  of  DNA  were  detected  by  0.8% 
agarose gel electrophoresis and stored at −20°C. The 
recommended oligonucleotide primers specific for the 
blaSHV [16], blaTEM [14], and blaCTX-M [17] genes used 
in the m-PCR assay and expected amplicon sizes are 
given in Table-1. All the primers used in the present 
study were procured from the Imperial Life Sciences 
(P) Limited, Gurgaon, Haryana, India. PCR reactions 
were performed in a total volume of 25 μl containing 
×10  PCR  buffer  (Tris  with  15  mM  MgCl2),  25  μM 
997

of each deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate, 10 pmol of 
each gene-specific primers, 1U Taq polymerase, and 
3 μl of template DNA. The m-PCR was done using 
thermocycler  (Mastercycler,  Eppendorf,  Germany), 
and  cycles  were  performed  with  initial  denaturation 
of 95°C for 10 min; 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C 
for 30 seconds, annealing at 60°C for 30 s, extension 
at 72°C for 2 min followed by a final extension step 
at 72°C for 10 min. After the completion of reaction 
cycles,  the  amplified  products  were  electrophoresed 
on 1.5% agarose gel and stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethid-
ium bromide. The images of ethidium bromide stained 
DNA bands were analyzed under UV transilluminator 
(Biometra) and recorded using a Gel Documentation 
System (Gel DocTMXR, Biorad, USA).
Results and Discussion

In the present study, a total of 191 (57.87%) iso-
lates were identified as E. coli after morphological and 
biochemical characterization. The highest prevalence 
of E. coli was observed in raw milk samples followed 
by chicken meat, chevon meat, and human urine and 
stool  samples  (Table-2).  In  chicken  meat  samples, 
66.32% prevalence of E. coli was recorded which is 
comparable with the findings of Patyal et al. [18], who 
reported  68%  prevalence  rate  in  Jaipur,  Rajasthan. 
Similarly,  Sharma  and  Bist  [19]  also  reported  70% 
prevalence  rate  in  chicken  meat  in  Mathura  city  of 
Uttar  Pradesh.  However,  lower  prevalence  rates  of 
40% were reported by Rashid et al. [20] in Jammu.

During the present study, 46.34% chevon meat sam-
ples  were  found  positive  for  E.  coli.  The  level  of 
contamination  was  significantly  lower  as  compared 
to  reports  of  Gangil  et  al.  [21],  who  recorded  76% 
prevalence in chevon meat in Jaipur, Rajasthan, India, 
and  on  contrary,  lower  prevalence  rates  of  16.66% 
by  Panda  et  al.  [22]  in  Palam  valley,  Uttarakhand, 
India; 35% by Ahmad et al. [23] in Lahore, Pakistan; 
38.09%  by  Dewangan  [24]  in  Chhattisgarh,  India, 
were reported. In milk samples, 81.1% prevalence of 
E. coli was recorded, which is lower than previously 
reported prevalence rates of 100% by Rai et al. [25] 
in Dehradun city, Uttarakhand, India. However, lower 
prevalence rates of 33.96% and 32.93% were reported 
by Rashid et al. [20] in Jammu and Kashmir, India, 
and  Gautam  et  al.  [26]  in  Allahabad,  UP,  India, 
respectively. The 25% prevalence of E. coli in human 
stool  and  urine  samples  was  recorded  in  the  pres-
ent study, which is comparable with the findings of 
Rajan  and  Prabavathy  [27],  who  reported  20.46% 
prevalence rate in urine samples in community hos-
pital of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. Whereas, higher 
prevalence rates of 32.5% and 59% were reported by 
Kumar et al. [28] and Virpari et al. [29] in Anand city, 
Gujarat,  India.  Kumar  et  al.  [30]  in  Greater  Noida 
and Xavier et al. [31] in Tamil Nadu, reported lower 
prevalence rates of 3.88% and 15%, respectively, in 
human stool sample.

Antimicrobial  susceptibility  test  showed  that 
41.36% isolates were resistant to cefotaxime followed 
by  oxytetracycline  (34.03%),  ampicillin  (29.31%), 
cephalexin  (24.60%),  cefixime  (16.75%),  and  cef-
tazidime  (13.08%).  A  similar  type  of  observations 
was also recorded by Rashid et al. [20], who reported 
that  40%  E.  coli  isolates  were  resistant  to  cefotax-
ime.  Among  191  E.  coli  isolates,  74  isolates  were 
resistant  for  two  or  more  than  two  antibiotics.  The 
highest MAR of 0.9 was recorded in one isolate, fol-
lowed by 0.81 by 2 isolates, 0.72 by 2 isolates, 0.63 
by 2 isolates, 0.54 by 13 isolates, 0.45 by 10 isolates, 
0.36 by 8 isolates, 0.27 by 12 isolates, and 0.18 by 
24 isolates. 57 isolates were resistant to single anti-
biotic representing 0.09 MAR index. On contrary, 60 
isolates were completely sensitive for all antibiotics. 
The prevalence of MAR in E. coli isolates was also

reported by Krumperman [13] and Jaulkar et al. [32]. 
The pathogens with higher indices of MAR in foods 
of  animal  origin  may  possibly  be  introduced  from 
the environment. The wide use and abuse of antibi-
otic in mass production of livestock has promoted the 
emergence of MAR E. coli in animals. MAR E. coli 
isolates were rarely found among animals, in which 
antibiotics are seldom or never used [13].

Out of 191 E. coli isolates, 21 (10.99%) were phe-
notypically identified as presumptive ESBL producers. 
Among 21 isolates, 9 (12.32%), 7 (18.42%), 2 (3.07), 
and 3 (20%) isolates were from milk, chevon meat, 
chicken  meat,  and  human  urine  and  stool  samples, 
respectively  (Table-2).  Rasheed  et  al.  [33]  reported 
12.5% ESBL producer isolates by phenotypic method 
in chicken meat which is in accordance to the present 
findings. The genotypic methods help us to confirm the 
presence of genes in E. coli isolates which are respon-
sible for ESBL production. Out of 21 E. coli presump-
tive ESBL producers, seven isolates expressed either 
one or two genes in m-PCR. The overall prevalence 
of  blaTEM and  blaCTX-M  genes  among  E.  coli  isolates 
recorded  was  3.66%  and  2.09%,  respectively.  The 
prevalence rate of  blaTEM gene among chevon meat, 
chicken meat, milk, and human clinical isolates were 
2.63%, 1.53%, 5.47%, and 6.66%, respectively. The 
prevalence rate of blaCTX-M gene in milk, chevon meat, 
and clinical samples were 2.73% (2/73), 1.53% (1/65), 
and 6.66% (1/15), respectively (Table-2). 2 milk and 1 
chevon E. coli isolates displayed expression of blaTEM 
gene only and 2 milk, 1 chicken meat, and 1 stool iso-
lates  were  harbored  both  blaTEM and  blaCTX-M genes, 
whereas none of the isolates expressed the blaSHV gene 
(Figure-1). Similarly, Apaka et al. [34] also reported a 
higher prevalence of blaTEM gene (100%) than blaCTX-M 
(37.5%) blaSHV (4.1%) gene. Amplification of whole 
genomic DNA increased the possibility of detection, 
compared to the amplification of plasmid DNA alone, 
suggesting beta-lactamase expression is controlled by 
both  chromosomal  and  plasmids  DNA.  Sometimes, 
multiple genes are responsible for the production of

ESBL in single isolates. Thus, the m-PCR was used 
for detection of two or more genes simultaneously in 
a  single  isolate.  This  method  provided  an  efficient, 
rapid  differentiation  of  ESBL  in  selected  species  of 
Enterobacteriaceae  and  provided  an  efficient,  rapid 
screening  of  large  number  of  isolates,  and  could  be 
used as a rapid tool for epidemiological studies among 
ESBL isolates.
Conclusion

The overall prevalence of E. coli in chicken meat, 
chevon meat, milk, and human clinical samples was 
found 57.87%. The study reveals that meat and milk 
samples are frequently contaminated with antimicro-
bial resistant bacteria due to the intensive use of anti-
microbial agents in animal husbandry and dairy sec-
tor. ESBL producing E. coli strains were also isolated 
chicken meat, chevon meat, milk, and human clinical 
samples. The m-PCR assay confirmed that 3.66% iso-
lates were harbored the blaTEM gene and 2.09% blaCTX-M 
gene. These multidrug-resistant and ESBL producing 
E. coli strains can be transmitted to the human pop-
ulation  after  consumption  of  meat,  milk,  and  their 
products. The appropriate antibiotic policy and infec-
tion control strategy in hospital settings are crucial to 
overcome the problems associated with infections by 
ESBL producing strains in humans. Thus, there is need 
for continued monitoring and surveillance of antimi-
crobial-resistant and ESBL producing E. coli at differ-
ent levels, viz., animals, human and environment, and 
factors that contribute to their emergence and spread.
