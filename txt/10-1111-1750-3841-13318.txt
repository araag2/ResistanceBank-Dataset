Isolation and Identiﬁcation of Aerobic Bacteria
Carrying Tetracycline and Sulfonamide Resistance
Genes Obtained from a Meat Processing Plant

Lili Li, Lei Ye, Sen Zhang, and Hecheng Meng

Abstract: Microbial contamination in food-processing plants can play a fundamental role in food quality and safety.
The purpose of this study was to investigate aerobic bacteria carrying tetracycline and sulfonamide resistance genes from
a meat processing plant as possible sources of meat contamination. One hundred swab samples from surfaces of conveyor
belts, meat slicers, meat knives, benches, plastic trays, gloves, and aprons were analyzed. A total of 168 isolates belonging
to 10 genera were obtained, including Pseudomonas sp. (n = 35), Acinetobacter sp. (n = 30), Aeromonas sp. (n = 20), Myroides
sp. (n = 15), Serratia sp. (n = 15), Staphylococcus sp. (n = 14), Enterobacter sp. (n = 11), Escherichia coli (n = 10), Lactococcus
sp. (n = 10), and Klebsiella sp. (n = 8). Of the 168 isolates investigated, 60.7% showed resistance to tetracycline and 57.7%
to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The tetracycline resistance genes tetL, tetA, tetB, tetC, tetE, tetM, tetS, tetK, and tetX
were found in the frequency of 7.7%, 6.0%, 4.8%, 4.8%, 3.6%, 3.6%, 3.6%, 1.2%, and 0.6%, respectively. Sulfonamide
resistance genes sul1 and sul2 were observed in the frequency of 17.9% and 38.1%, respectively. The tetracycline resistance
genes tetX was ﬁrst found in Myroides sp. This investigation demonstrated that food contact surfaces in a meat processing
plant may be sources of contamination of aerobic bacteria carrying tetracycline and sulfonamide antibiotic resistance
genes.

Practical Application: The occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in raw meat products and processing environments
has been found to be a potential danger to human health. To improve the safety of meat products, it is important to
determine the antibiotic resistance, especially to important clinical antibiotics and its antibiotic resistance determinants.
In this study, aerobic bacteria isolated from food contact surfaces in a meat processing plant were found to be a potential
reservoir of tetracycline and sulfonamide antibiotic-resistance genes and the situation has to be monitored regularly.

Introduction

Long-time extensive and inappropriate use of antibiotics for
growth promotion or as therapeutic and preventive treatments
in food animals may generate selective pressure for emergence
of multiple drug resistant (MDR) bacteria (Barton 2014). The
prevalence of MDR bacteria in farm, slaughterhouse environ-
ments, and retail foods have been reported in several studies (Lavilla
Lerma and others 2013; Novais and others 2013; Casella and oth-
ers 2015). Microorganisms, including pathogens and commensal
bacteria present in animal foods and their processing environment
may cause a great challenge for human health in terms of their
role as a potential reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs)
and potential pathogenic power, which may transmit to humans
through the food chain (Wang and others 2012). Therefore, stud-
ies on the sources of contamination and dissemination routes of
ARGs in food chains and processing environments are critically
important.

Meat products are quite susceptible to microbial cross-
contamination due to their abundant nutrients, which favor mi-

crobial growth in meat processing facilities (Schwaiger and others
2012). Various microbial contamination sources can be identiﬁed
in a meat processing plant,
including conveyor belts, knives,
benches, and other tools (Mart´ın and others 2014). Although any
buildup of microbial contamination on most food contact surfaces
during day-to-day operations can be controlled by sanitation prac-
tices, some contact surfaces may develop excessively high loads of
microbial contamination, which would act as continual sources
of contamination for products coming in contact with them
(Lavilla Lerma and others 2013). Sublethal concentrations of
biocides
in food industries may lead to the emergence of
tolerance/resistance to various biocides and speciﬁc genotypes
(resistant) may have the ability to survive routine disinfection
procedures
(Lavilla Lerma and others 2014). Some species
can also become resident in the facilities by forming bioﬁlms
on food-processing surfaces
In
fact, food contact surfaces have been recognized as important
sources of microbial contamination and recontamination in the
food industry (Khamisse and others 2012; Lavilla Lerma and
others 2013; de Candia and others 2015). Several foodborne
pathogens and opportunistic pathogens in poultry and bovine
slaughterhouses and processing plants have been isolated, such as
Staphylococcus sp. including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus au-
reus, extended-spectrum b-lactamase—producing Escherichia coli,
Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Enterococcus spp.,
Psychrotrophs including pseudomonas and lactic acid bacteria

(Lindsay and others 1996).

In this study

(Schwaiger and others 2012; Giombelli and others 2014; Mart´ın
and others 2014; Normanno and others 2015; Pacholewicz and
others 2015). However, commensal bacteria, considered as a
hidden reservoir of ARGs, have not been thoroughly analyzed.

Tetracycline and sulfonamide are broad spectrum antimicrobials
and are most popularly used in livestock farming in China due to
the efﬁcacy, low cost, and lack of side effects (Cheng and others
2013). Tetracycline (tet) and sulfonamide (sul) resistance genes are
associated with integrons, transposons, or plasmids, and can trans-
fer with other resistance genes located in these mobile elements
among bacterial species (Robert 2005), leading to multidrug resis-
tance. Tet and sul genes have been reported as the most frequently
detected ARGs in livestock farms, animal manures, and waste wa-
ter (Cheng and others 2013; Kim and others 2013; Zhu and others
2013). However, few studies have been conducted to evaluate the
diversity of tet and sul genes in the processing environment, which
facilitates the transfer of ARGs from indigenous environmental
bacteria to foodborne microorganisms through contamination.

This study demonstrated that aerobic bacteria carrying tet and
sul genes can be isolated from food contact surfaces in a meat
processing plant during normal operations and may be a potential
reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes. This study provides valuable

information to reduce the sources of contamination with resistant
bacteria during food processing and thus to minimize the risk for
the consumer.

Materials and Methods
Sample collection

The present research was performed with 100 samples col-
lected from a local large-scale pork processing plant (Xiamen,
China). This pork-processing plant was representative of the re-
gion and received pigs from more than100 farms in 9 cities of
Fujian province. Samples were taken from contact surfaces during
ongoing production early in the mornings on our 4 visits in 2013.
Surface samples were taken with sterile cotton swabs from the
sites of 100 cm2 in the selected processing line surfaces that the
raw pork was in contact with, including conveyor belts (4 sam-
ples each time), meat slicers (4 samples each time), meat knives
(4 samples each time), benches (2 samples each time), plastic trays
(3 samples each time), gloves (4 samples each time), and aprons
(4 samples each time). The samples were transported to the labo-
ratory in an icebox within 2 hours and were used immediately for
bacterial isolation.

Bacterial isolation and identiﬁcation
The cotton swabs were immersed in 10 mL of sterile Brain
Heart Infusion (BHI) broth and incubated at 30 ± 1 °C for 24 h.
After reviviﬁcation, 100 μL of each sample were serially diluted
and plated on BHI agar and the plates were incubated at 30 ±
1 °C for up to 48 h. After incubation, morphologically different
isolates were streaked onto a nutrient agar plate for puriﬁcation
and enrichment at 30 ± 1 °C for 18 to 24 h. The isolates were
identiﬁed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and comparison with
sequences in GenBank using BLAST. All isolates were stored in
BHI broth containing 15% glycerol at −80 °C until use.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

All isolates were tested for their susceptibility to tetracycline
(30 μg) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (23.75/1.25 μg)
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., U.S.A.) using the Kirby–Bauer
disk diffusion method. The resistance level was deﬁned as de-
scribed by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Inst. (CLSI 2012).
Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923, E. coli ATCC 25922 were used
as quality control organisms.

Detection of tet and sul genes, Tn 916, and class 1 integrons
Genomic DNA was extracted from the isolates as previously
described (Wang and others 2006). To encompass a broad range of
genetic determinants, 15 tet genes including 7 efﬂux pump genes
(tetA, tetC, tetE, tetG, tetK, tetL, tetA/P), 7 ribosomal protection
proteins (RPPs) genes (tetM, tetO, tetQ, tetS, tetT, tetW, tetB), and
1 enzymatic modiﬁcation gene (tetX) and 3 sul genes (sul1, sul2,
and sul3) were screened by PCR using primers and protocols
described previously (Table 1). Tet and sul genes associated mobile
genetic elements—transposon Tn916 and class 1 integron were
also screened (Table 1).

Results
Bacterial species

A total of 168 strains were isolated in this study (belonging to
8 genera), comprising 35 Pseudomonas sp. (20.8%), 30 Acinetobacter
sp. (17.9%), 20 Aeromonas sp. (11.9%), 15 Myroides sp. (8.9%), 15
Serratia sp. (8.9%), 14 Staphylococcus sp. (8.3%), 11 Enterobacter sp.
(6.5%), 10 E. coli (6.0%), 10 Lactococcus sp. (6.0%), and 8 Klebsiella
sp. (4.8%) (Table 2).

Antimicrobial susceptibility

Of the 168 isolates, 102 (60.7%) and 97 (57.7%) exhibited resis-
tance to tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, respec-
tively. Fifty-three (31.5%) showed resistance to these 2 kinds of
antibiotics simultaneously. Concerning antibiotic resistant bacte-
ria, 85.7% (30/35) of Pseudomonas sp., 85.7% of Staphylococcus sp.
(12/14), 86.7% (13/15) of Serratia spp., 80% (8/10) of Lactococ-
cus sp., 80% (8/10) of E. coli, 60.0% (18/30) of Acinetobacter sp.,
and 55.0% (11/20) of Aeromonas sp. showed resistance to tetra-
cycline. All Enterobacter sp. and Klebsiella sp. strains were sensitive
to tetracycline. Regarding trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resis-
tant bacteria, 100% (10/10) of Lactococcus sp., 93.3% (14/15) of
Myroides sp., 91.4% (32/35) of Pseudomonas sp., 85.7% (12/14) of
Staphylococcus sp., 60% (6/10) of E. coli, 50% (10/20) of Aeromonas
sp., and 26.7% (8/30) of Acinetobacter sp. were resistant. It is note-
worthy that all species isolated showed resistance to trimetho-
prim/sulfamethoxazole (Table 2).

Occurrence of tet and sul genes

Among the 15 tet genes evaluated in this study, tetL (7.7%)
was found in the highest frequency followed by tetA (6.0%), tetB
(4.8%), tetC (4.8%), tetE (3.6%), tetM (3.6%), tetS (3.6%), tetK
(1.2%), and tetX (0.6%). tetG, tetA/P, tetO, tetQ, tetT, and tetW
were not detected in any of the bacteria evaluated (Table 3 and 4).
One isolate of Klebsiella sp., E. coli and Aeromonas sp. carried 2 tet
genes, tetA+tetL, tetA+tetC, and tetE+tetL, respectively (Table 4).
Of the 3 sul genes detected, sul2 was observed at a higher frequency
(38.1%) than sul1 (17.9%) in these isolates, no sul3 was detected.
Overall, all of the genera were found to carry 1 or more resistance
genes; irrespective of whether the isolates were phenotypically
resistant or susceptible (Table 4). No class 1 integron and Tn916
was detected among these isolates by our PCR method.

Discussion

Meats products are easily contaminated from self and en-
vironmental contamination during processing. To understand
the strategy of development and spread of antibiotic-resistant
bacteria via food chain to human, more information about
the various sources of contamination and resistance determi-
nants
in the meat processing industry is
needed.

Results of this study conﬁrmed that food contact surfaces in a
meat processing environment may serve as important sources of
meat contamination of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and revealed
that these bacteria were a reservoir of ARGs. In this study, most

of aerobic species isolated were opportunistic pathogens or com-
mensals. The majority of isolates were resistant to tetracycline and
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. All genera were found to harbor
tet or sul genes. The resistance genes carried by these bacteria may
have the potential to transfer into the human ﬂora and pathogens
through mobile genetic elements, although further study is re-
quired to understand this in the context of the isolates described
in this study.

Psychrotrophs

(mainly Gram-negative bacteria) and pseu-
domonads have been reported as the most commonly detected
microbial groups obtained from slaughterhouse surfaces samples
(Lavilla Lerma and others 2013). In this study, meat spoilage organ-
isms, including Pseudomonas sp., Acinetobacter sp., and Aeromonas sp.
were the most frequently detected bacteria in the samples. Overall,
most of the bacterial genera isolated in this study are found natu-
rally in meat and the environment (soil, water, and sewage), with
some strains classiﬁed as opportunistic human pathogens causing a
variety of infectious diseases in animals and humans. Concerning
resistance to antibiotics, all species isolated were found resistant
to tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole except all En-
terobacter sp. and Klebsiella sp. strains, which were found sensitive
to tetracycline. High percentage of Staphylococcus sp., Pseudomonas
sp., and Lactococcus sp. isolates showed resistance to both tetracy-
cline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Approximately half of
Aeromonas sp. isolates were resistant to tetracycline and trimetho-
prim/sulfamethoxazole. Most of Acinetobacter sp. and Serratia sp.
isolates were just resistant to tetracycline, and most Myroides sp.
species were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Most
of E. coli isolates were resistant to tetracycline and half of them
resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. High resistance rate
to tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole has been re-
ported in China, which was related to the use of those antimicro-
bials in feed as additives and veterinary practices (Zhu and others
2013; Jiang and Shi 2013). The resistance may also be a result of the
genetic transfer of resistance determinants potentiated by the use
of sub-inhibitory disinfectants employed as daily sanitation prac-
tices. In this sense, further studies are needed to elucidate whether

there is a cross resistance or a coresistance between antibiotics and
disinfectants.

Previous studies reported various percentages of different tet and
sul genes in ready-to-eat food, food-producing animals, environ-
ment, and human bacteria (Schwaiger and others 2010; Schwaiger
and others 2012; Jiang and others 2013; Liu and others 2015).
Despite the overall occurrence of tet and sul genes in our iso-
lates being lower than that of previous studies, the range of
species known to carry these genetic determinants is increased
(Table 4). All genera isolated in this study were found to be tet
or sul carriers (Table 4). To the best of our knowledge, tetX was
ﬁrst found in a species of Myroides sp. (KT033506). The occur-
rence of efﬂux pump genes (tetL, tetA, tetB, and tetC) in our
isolates is not surprising because these genes are the most com-
monly found tet genes in Gram-negative genera (Robert, 2005).
Compared with tet genes, both sul1 and sul2 were observed at
higher frequencies. High frequency of sul genes found in sensitive
isolates indicated that these genes are probably not expressed, or
the genes lose function because of mutation or deletion (Bren-
ciani and others 2007; Yan and others 2010). This phenomenon
merit attention as these genes may be potentially expressed un-
der regular exposure to sublethal concentrations of disinfectants or
antibiotics.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated that aerobic bacteria on food contact
surfaces may act as a reservoir of ARGs and potentially spread to
human via food chain. It is necessary to screen a wide range of
commensal and common environmental bacteria for carriage of
resistance genes from various sources. Further studies are needed
to identify the possibility of more organisms and associated ARGs
and mobile genetic elements, such as plasmid-mediated conjuga-
tion and transposon, and to characterize horizontal dissemination
mechanisms for antibiotic resistance among different genera and
species. To avoid the adaptation and evolution of antibiotic resis-
tance of strains on food contact surfaces, good hygienic practice
should be implemented. Hygienic equipment with no recesses
