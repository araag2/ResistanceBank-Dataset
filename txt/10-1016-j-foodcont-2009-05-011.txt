This study was conducted in Thailand (Bangkok and Pathum Thani provinces), from June 2006 to July
2007, in order to assess the prevalence of Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157, Salmonella, Shigella
and Vibrio parahaemolyticus in foods. Retail raw meats and seafood, including chicken (n = 109), pork
(n = 80), beef (n = 108), shrimp (n = 43) and oysters (n = 48), from open markets and supermarkets were
analyzed. Salmonella was found in 22 of 61 (36%) open market samples (48% of chicken, none of pork and
beef, and 53% of shrimp) and in 12 of 75 (16%) samples from supermarkets (57%, 12%, 24%, 0% respec-
tively). However, a small number of L. monocytogenes were isolated, where 6 of 217 (3%) were samples
from open markets (6% of chicken and 3% of pork) and 17 of 171 (10%) were from supermarkets (3% of
beef, 4% of chicken, and 32% of pork). In both markets, L. monocytogenes was not detected from shrimps,
neither from oysters. E. coli O157, Shigella and tdh-positive V. parahaemolyticus were not isolated in this
collection. Several Salmonella and L. monocytogenes isolates were multidrug-resistant. Both markets
would need better assessment, since multidrug-resistant strains have been isolated and they may lead
to therapeutic failure.

1. Introduction

Thailand in the past years has been shown as an outstanding ex-
porter of chicken meat and shrimp. Export products fulﬁll the
international hygiene requirement standards, such as HACCP and
GMP. Chicken and shrimp market chains show that exporter farms
productions are not exclusive for export and part of their products
are consumed in the domestic market as well (Sriwichailamphan,
2007). In the other hand, non-export producers with varied hy-
giene standard and production levels also supply the local retailers.
The most consumed meat in the country is pork, followed by chick-
en and beef (FAO, 2007). There are basically two kinds of markets
in Thailand: supermarkets and open markets. The supermarkets,
which are indoor markets, often display prepackaged products un-
der refrigeration. In contrast, the open markets usually display un-
wrapped products at ambient temperatures, exposing to potential
contaminations.

Diarrheal diseases have been considered the major public
health problem in Thailand. There are approximately more than

120,000 cases of reported food poisoning cases every year (FAO,
2004). Since foods are important vehicle of pathogens, identifying
pathogens in outbreaks is critical in order to maintain awareness of
ongoing problems (Olsen, MacKinon, Goulding, Bean, & Slutsker,
2000). Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella, Vibrio parahae-
molyticus and Escherichia coli O157 are common bacterial agents in-
volved with foodborne disease (CDC, 2007). The presence of these
pathogens in raw food stuffs may result in further cross contami-
nation and it may lead to public health consequences.

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and
the antibiotic resistance of Salmonella, E. coli O157, L. monocytog-
enes, V. parahaemolyticus and Shigella in retail raw meats and sea-
food obtained in open markets and supermarkets from Bangkok
and Pathum Thani provinces, Thailand, in order to provide better
picture of the burdens due to pathogens commonly transmitted
by food.

which, 136 were analyzed for Salmonella, 388 for L. monocytogenes,
186 for E. coli O157, 91 for Shigella and 48 for V. parahaemolyticus. A
total of 36 samplings were done in open markets and supermarkets
located in Bangkok (two open markets and four supermarkets) and
Pathum Thani (three open markets and one supermarket) during
the period of June 2006 to July 2007. The sampling markets were
chosen according to the convenience of distance from the labora-
tory. Sample number collected per market varied from 10 to 20
samples. The open markets are composed of booths where the
meat vendors are specialized solely in one meat type, displaying
the products in plastic trays with no covers, at ambient tempera-
ture, exposing them to potential contaminations such as insects
and rodents. The seafood vendors in open markets often have ice
directly on their products. Open market meat samples were cut,
weighed, placed in a plastic bag and tied by the meat vendor, while
seafood samples were taken by the vendors’ bare hands. Supermar-
ket samples were already pre-weighed and prepackaged in plastic
wrap and displayed under refrigeration. Sampling criteria was lim-
ited to 200 g of one sample per vendor in open markets, and to one
package per meat cut or seafood in supermarkets. Meat samples
were limited to breast, thigh and wing for chicken, and steak and
ground meat for cow and pork. No organ meat was sampled in this
study. Shrimp were limited to entire samples, and oysters were
limited to shelled samples. All samples were within the recom-
mended date for consume, and were transported on ice and pro-
cessed in the laboratory within 3 h after purchase. Sample is
considered here as the each item purchased from the market, while
isolate is the each strain of pathogen isolated as single colony from
selective agars, and was characterized as distinct either in serotype
or in antibiotic resistance.

2.2. Bacterial isolation

coli O157,

Salmonella spp., E.

Modiﬁcations of methods described in the FDA CFSAN – Bacte-
riological Analytical Manual Online (FDA, 2001) were used to iso-
late
L. monocytogenes, V.
parahaemolyticus, and Shigella spp. The isolation protocols for all
pathogens proceeded with 25 g of each sample aseptically placed
in a ﬁltered stomaching bag (TGK-Tokyo Glass Kikai, Tokyo, Japan)
and 225 ml of appropriate pre-enrichment broth added. The sam-
ple was homogenized in the stomacher (AES Laboratoire, France)
for 1 min, sealed, and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Except for L. mon-
ocytogenes, which was incubated at room temperature for 48 h,
incubation steps for all protocols were performed at 37 °C. Enrich-
ment and selection processes are described below.

2.3. Salmonella

For Salmonella isolation, 225 ml of Buffered Peptone Water (OX-
OID, Basingstoke, Hampshire, England) was added to the sample. A
0.5 ml portion of overnight enrichment broth was added to 10 ml
of Rappaport-Vassiliadis (MERCK, Darmstadt, Germany). After
24 h of incubation, the broth culture was streaked on DHL (Deoxy-
cholate Hydrogen sulﬁde Lactose) agar, (Eiken Kizai, Tokyo, Japan)
and CHROMagar Salmonella (CHROMagar, Paris, France) agar
plates and incubated for 24 h. Suspected colonies were submitted
to TSI (Triple Sugar Iron) (OXOID) and MIL (Motility Indol Lysin)
(BD, Sparks, MD., USA) biochemical tests, and serotypes were
determined by using Denka-Seiken (Tokyo, Japan) antisera follow-
ing Kauffman-White serotyping scheme (Popoff, 2001).

one drop of immunomagnetic beads O157 (Denka-Seiken) was
added to 1 ml of culture, and incubated according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. After washing step, it was suspended in 100 ll
of phosphate buffered saline, from which each 50 ll was streaked
on CHROMagar O157 TAM (CHROMagar) and on CT-SMAC (OX-
OID). Suspected colonies were submitted to biochemical TSI and
MIL tests, and O157 antisera (Denka-Seiken) was used for serotype
conﬁrmation.

2.5. L. monocytogenes

The isolation of L. monocytogenes strains was detected by add-
ing Half Fraser broth to samples and incubating for 48 h at room
temperature. A 0.1 ml portion of broth was transferred to 10 ml
Fraser Broth. A loopful of overnight culture was streaked on PAL-
CAM (OXOID) and CHROMagar Listeria (CHROMagar) agars and
incubated for 48 h. Presumptive colonies were submitted to sugar
fermentation test (Rhamnose, Mannitol, Dextrose (Cica Kanto,
Tokyo, Japan)) and Rhamnose positive strains were submitted to
seroagglutination test (Denka-Seiken).

2.6. Shigella

Shigella Broth (OXOID) with novobiocin (Cica Kanto) and 1.5 g/l
Tween 80 (Cica Kanto) was added to samples to detect Shigella and
incubated for 24 h. A loopful of broth was streaked on Salmonella
Shigella (OXOID) and on DHL agar, and incubated for 24 h. Pre-
sumptive colonies were submitted to biochemical TSI and MIL
tests.

2.7. V. parahaemolyticus

Samples were homogenized in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)
with 3% NaCl. Subsequently, 10 ml of mixture was added to 90 ml
of Alkaline Peptone Water (OXOID) and incubated for 24 h. A loop-
ful of broth was streaked on TCBS (Thiosulfate Citrate Bile Salts Su-
crose) agar (MERCK) and CHROMagar Vibrio (CHROMagar) plates.
Following incubation, suspected colonies were submitted to tests
of MIL, TSI and Nutrient Broth (BD) with 0%, 3%, 8%, and 10% of
NaCl. Isolates with turbidity in 3% and 8% of NaCl were submitted
to PCR analysis.

2.8. PCR assays

All suspected single colonies were subcultured on Tryptic Soy
Agar (TSA) (BD) and analyzed by PCR. Targets, primer sequences,
and PCR product sizes are shown in Table 1. The templates were
prepared by boiling half to a loopful of colonies in 100 ll of dis-
tilled water for 10 min. PCR reagents were purchased from TaKaRa
Bio (Japan). Each PCR reaction was processed independently, and
the 25 ll reaction mixture contained the following: 1 reaction
buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 lM
each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, 10 pmol of each primer, 1 U of
Taq polymerase, and 10 ll of bacterial template. PCR were ran in
Takara PCR Thermal Cycler Dice with the following conditions: ini-
tial denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min; 30 cycles of ampliﬁcation
(denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 52 °C for 30 s and
extension at 72 °C for 30 s), and ﬁnal extension at 72 °C for
10 min. PCR products were stained with ethidium bromide and
visualized under UV light after gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose.

2.4. E. coli O157

2.9. Serotyping: Salmonella

Samples were incubated for 24 h in mTSB (Modiﬁed Tryptic Soy
Broth) (MERCK) to isolate E. coli O157. One milliliter of overnight
broth was subcultured in 9 ml of mTSB. Following the incubation,

Salmonella antisera were purchased from Denka-Seiken. Three
to ﬁve times the amount of a match head of Salmonella grown over-
night at 37 °C on TSA were emulsiﬁed with 0.5 ml of 0.85% saline to

prepare the somatic antigen suspensions. Five microliters of sus-
pension was rocked on slide glass for 1 min with one drop of
respective somatic factor. The ﬂagellar antigen suspensions were
prepared by adding 6 ml of 1% formalin-treated saline to 6 ml of
overnight culture in TSB (Tryptic Soy Broth), which was sit for
1 h prior to use. Five hundred microliters of suspension were incu-
bated in glass tubes at 50 °C for 1 h with three drops of respective
ﬂagellar factors. Phase induction was performed using Craigie
tubes in TSB with 0.3% agar.

2.10. Serotyping: L. monocytogenes

L. monocytogenes antisera were purchased from Denka-Seiken
Overnight culture grown in BHI agar (Brain Heart Infusion) at
30 °C was diluted to 10 mg in wet weight per ml with 0.2% saline,
autoclaved at 121 °C for 30 min and concentrated to prepare the
somatic antigen suspension. One loopfull of suspension were
rocked on slide glass for 1 min with one drop of respective somatic
factor. To prepare the ﬂagellar antigen suspensions, the culture
was grown on BHI agar at 30 °C, where it was subjected to 5–6 pas-
sages through ﬁlter paper stripes (Whatman, GE Healthcare, USA)
bridging cut agars. After the passages on cut agars, 4 ml overnight
culture was prepared and 4 ml of 1% formalin-treated saline was
added, which was sat for 1 h prior to use. Five hundred microliters
of ﬂagellar antigen suspension were incubated in glass tubes at
50 °C for 1 h with three drops of respective ﬂagellar factors.

2.11. Antimicrobial susceptibility determination

Antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella and L. monocytogenes was
determined by using disk diffusion test (Sensi-Disc, BD), following
manufacturer’s instructions and interpreted in accordance to the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute – CLSI (CLSI, 2006)
guidelines. The antibiotics tested for Salmonella with their respec-
tive concentrations per disk in lg were: gentamycin 10 sulﬁsoxa-
zole 25, chloramphenicol 30, ciproﬂoxacin 5, kanamycin 30,
nalidixic acid 30, tetracycline 30, ampicillin 10 and streptomycin
10. Except for penicillin, ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfameth-
oxazole, there are no susceptibility zone-diameter breakpoints
for Listeria provided by the CLSI, therefore, we adopted Staphylococ-
cus spp. criteria, as employed by other investigators (Troxler, von
Graevenitz, Funke, Wiedemann, & Stock, 2000; Hansen, Gerner-
Smidt, & Bruun, 2005). The antibiotics tested for L. monocytogenes
with their respective concentrations per disk in lg were: amikacin

30, ampicillin 10, bacitracin 10, chloramphenicol 30, ciproﬂoxacin
5, clindamycin 2, erythromycin 14, gentamicin 10, imipenem 10,
kanamycin 30, levoﬂoxacin 5, minocycline 30, netilmicin 30, nitro-
furantoin 300, penicillin 10, rifampicin 5, streptomycin 10,
teicoplanin 30, tetracycline 30, tobramycin 10, trimethoprim- sul-
famethoxazole 23.75/1.25 and vancomycin 30.

2.12. Statistical analysis

Chi-squared (v2) or two-sided Fisher’s exact tests were used to
analyze the data sorted by meat type, pathogen and market type. A
probability value of less than 5% was considered to be signiﬁcant.

3. Results and discussion

This study describes the prevalence of foodborne pathogens in
open markets and supermarkets in Thailand. Salmonella and L.
moncytogenes were the only pathogens detected in this collection.
Analyzing open market and supermarket contamination preva-
lence, statistically signiﬁcant differences were observed in L. mon-
ocytogenes prevalence in pork and in Salmonella prevalence in
shrimps (Table 2).

3.1. Salmonella prevalence

Salmonella was detected in 34 (25%) of 136 samples analyzed,
including three chicken samples which harbored more than two
serotypes. All of 34 isolates were stn positive. Supermarket beef
(24%), chicken (57%) and pork (12%) had higher contamination
prevalence than open markets (0%, 48%, and 0%, respectively). No
isolates of Salmonella were detected in supermarket shrimp sam-
ples. In contrast, 53% of open market shrimp were contaminated.
These contaminated shrimps were all derived from the samples
collected on the same day, at the same market, but from 10 differ-
ent vendors. This open market shrimps were sampled twice, and in
the second batch, no Salmonella was isolated. The high prevalence
from one particular sampling date increased the total open market
shrimp contamination prevalence. But we suggest that this fact
should not be taken as a persistent contamination in the market
environment, since the sampling which took place on different
day had no Salmonella isolates. Supposing that all the booths we
have sampled have had the same supplier or utilized the same
transport company, probably the contamination may have hap-
pened in these stages, and then spread to the vendors.

The World Health Organization (WHO) National Salmonella and
Shigella Centre of Bangkok summarized the notiﬁed Salmonella ser-
otypes in the Annual Report 2006 (Bangtrakulnonth & Tishyadhi-
gama, 2006). In this report, Stanley, Weltervreden and Corvallis
are the most frequently isolated serotypes in raw material foods.
Our results are in accordance with Stanley (14%) and Corvallis
(14%), but we did not isolate any Weltervreden. In each meat type,
the most frequently isolated serotype differed. In open market
samples were Corvallis (chicken, 21%) and Stanley (shrimp, 21%),
while in supermarket were Rissen (beef, 20%) and Mbandaka
(chicken, 20%).

3.2. L. monocytogenes prevalence

In Thailand, it was reported that L. monocytogenes was isolated
from seafood and vegetables (Swetwiwathana & Chungsamanukool,
1995; Panya & Chamrieng, 1997; Chungsamanokool, Wongsommat,
& Phanbualuang, 1995). To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst survey of
L. monocytogenes in retail raw meats in Thailand. L. monocytogenes
was isolated in 23 (6%) of 388 samples, including one supermarket
pork sample which harbored two serotypes. All of 23 isolates
were hly positive. The contamination prevalence was higher in

supermarket (10%) than in open markets (3%). Supermarket pork
(32%) had signiﬁcantly higher contamination than open market
pork (3%). We determined the serotypes of the total 24 isolates,
and 16 were 4b and 8 were 4c. No other serotype was found in this
collection.

From the 23 samples that tested positive for L. monocytogenes,
16 were isolated from pork, among which, 10 were serotype 4b.
L. monocytogenes has been reported as the pathogen with the high-
est severity score among zoonoses transmitted by pork in Europe
(Fosse, Seegers, & Magras, 2008). The prevalence of L. monocytoge-
nes in pork found in the literature varies from 0.7% and 2% in car-
casses (Lindblad, Lindmark, Lambertz, & Lindqvist, 2007; Yeh,
Chen, & Lin, 2005) to 11.1% and 38% in ready-to-eat food (Cabedo,
Picart i Barrot, & Teixido i Canelles, 2008; Berzins, Horman, Lunden,
& Korkeala, 2007). Although the serotypes most frequently isolated
from pork are 1/2a, 1/2c, and 1/2b (Giovannacci et al., 1999; Theve-
not et al., 2006) and 4b has been less frequently isolated from food
(Thevenot et al., 2006), most of our isolates were 4b from pork, and
this serotype is known to be associated with major outbreaks
(Swaminathan & Gerner-Smidt, 2007). Since low virulence 4b has
been reported (Roche et al., 2005), there is a need to better analyze
these food isolates in their genetic diversity perspective, in order to
correlate with human isolates. Nevertheless, the ﬁnding of 4b in
this collection is a matter of concern and further characterization
regarding virulence would be needed for risk assessment.

3.3. E. coli O157

The 186 samples analyzed for E. coli O157 tested negative. How-
ever, two suspected isolates were mauve colonies on CHROMagar
O157 TAM agar plates and agglutinated with O157 antiserum.
We have screened for stx, rfbEO157, and ﬂiCH7 genes by PCR, in order
to assure that these colonies were not results of cross-reaction
(Bettelheim, Evangelidis, Pearce, Sowers, & Strockbine, 1993; Alek-
sic, Karch, & Bockemuhl, 1992; Voravuthikunchai, Keisaku, Iida, &
Honda, 2002). All the PCR results were negative, concluding that
these isolates were not E. coli O157. To date, Stx positive O157 from
food has been reported in Thailand only by Vuddhakul, Patararung-
rong et al. (2000). Chomvarin et al. (2005) has obtained O157 from
ready-to-eat food, but non-virulent strain, and Suthienkul et al.
(1990) has reported stx isolation from retail meat, but no O157
was found, while Voravuthikunchai et al. (2002) did not detect
any O157. In addition, no case of diarrhea associated with E. coli
O157 has been reported (Kalnauwakul, Phengmak, Kongmuang,
Nakaguchi, & Nishibuchi, 2007; Ratchtrachenchai, Subpasu,

Hayashi, & Ba-Thein, 2004; Leelaporn et al., 2003). The reason of
the non-identiﬁcation of E. coli O157 either in food or in clinical
cases has been discussed rigorously (Voravuthikunchai, Chaowana,
Perepat, Iida, & Honda, 2005).

3.4. Shigella

An outbreak of Shigella dysenteriae associated with consumption
of coconut milk dessert has been reported in Thailand (Hoge,
Bodhidatta, Tungtaem, & Echeverria, 1995), and more recently,
Denmark and Australia have reported outbreaks of S. Sonnei asso-
ciated with baby corn imported from Thailand (Lewis et al.,
2007). Although culture-conﬁrmed Shigella incidence isolated from
patients with diarrhea in Thailand is 0.6/1000 population per year
(von Seidlein et al., 2006), we did not isolate any Shigella in this
study. Suspected colonies on selective agars were conﬁrmed as
negative in subsequent tests either by biochemical testes or also
by PCR screening.

3.5. V. parahaemolyticus

Among 48 oyster samples tested for V. parahaemolyticus, three
open market samples yielded typical green colonies on TCBS agar
plates. When these isolates were analyzed in Nutrient Broth with
0%, 3%, 8% and 10% of NaCl, they only grew in 3% NaCl. A typical
V. parahaemolyticus would grow in 3% and 8% of NaCl. In addition,
when analyzed by PCR, none of the isolates harbored tdh, thermo-
stable direct hemolysin, a gene related to pathogenicity. In previ-
ous reports, tdh negative strains have been frequently isolated
from food, and tdh positive strains more often from clinical isolates
(Serichantalergs et al., 2007; Vuddhakul, Chowdhury, et al., 2000;
Wong, Chen, Liu, & Liu, 1999; Yamamoto et al., 2008). Although
tdh-positive V. parahaemolyticus was not isolated in this study, sea-
sonal factor may have inﬂuenced the results.

3.6. Salmonella antibiotic resistance

In the antibiotic susceptibility test, most of the Salmonella iso-
lates showed resistance to sulﬁsoxazole, tetracycline and strepto-
mycin (Table 3). Multidrug-resistant Salmonella (resistant to four
or more antibiotics) were found both in supermarket and open
market isolates. The serotypes resistant to the largest number of
antibiotics among supermarket samples were Rissen and Stanley
(isolated from beef), showing resistance to six of nine antibiotics
tested, while among open market samples, Schwarzengrund (iso-
lated from chicken) was resistant to eight antibiotics. None of

shrimp isolates were multidrug-resistant. Although it is a single
isolate, in this study Schwarzengrund showed resistance to eight
of nine antibiotics tested. It is a matter of concern because it is re-
ported that human Salmonella infection caused by Schwarzengrund
in Thailand has increased from 0% in 1992 to 2.4% in 2001 (Aarest-
rup et al., 2007). Considering the increased incidence of this sero-
type, added to its multidrug-resistance,
the probability of
complicated Schwarzengrund infection may increase.

3.7. L. monocytogenes antibiotic resistance

In the L. monocytogenes antibiotic susceptibility test, all the iso-
lates showed resistance to penicillin, except for one. Open market
isolates showed resistance to ampicillin, clindamycin and penicillin,
while supermarket isolates showed resistance also to ciproﬂoxacin,

gentamicin, streptomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
Among pork isolates with serotype 4b, there was an isolate resistant
to ampicillin, penicillin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim-sulfameth-
oxazole (Table 4). These antibiotics are commonly used for treat-
ment of
listeriosis, and the existence of multidrug-resistant
isolates emphasizes the need for sensitivity test for treatment of
foodborne disease.

Occurrence of multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria has in-
creased in frequency in the past few years. When added to the fact
that the genetic elements can be exchanged between intestinal
bacteria (Callaway, Edrington, Anderson, Byrd, & Nisbet, 2008),
they threaten high risk population lives, such as newborn and
immunocompromised persons.
In Thailand, bacteremia among
HIV-infected patients, have been reported to range between 20%
and 30%, and the most isolated pathogen is Salmonella (Mootsika-
pun, 2007; Srifuengfung, Chokephaibulkit, Yungyuen, & Tribuddh-
arat, 2005). Among bacteremia
caused by non-typhoidal
salmonellosis in Thailand, up to 30% were multidrug-resistant
(Kiratisin, 2008). Although the mortality rate caused by salmonel-
losis had decreased in the past years, the increase of multidrug-
resistant strains may lead to a therapeutic failure. Although
listeriosis is relatively rare in HIV-infected persons, listerial central
nervous system infections in immunocompromised patients may
have severe clinical forms (Eckburg, Montoya, & Vosti, 2001; Guerra
et al., 2004). Furthermore, an ampicillin-resistant L. monocytogenes
causing brain abscess has been reported in Thailand (Tree-
bupachatsakul, Srifeungfung, & Chayakulkeeree, 2006). This study
detected the serotype 4b frequently associated with outbreaks,
and the ﬁnding of isolate resistant to commonly used antibiotics
for listeriosis therapy, may indicate a risk for the consumers.

Except for Salmonella contamination in shrimps, supermarkets
contamination prevalence for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes were
higher than open markets. Although there is a tendency to think that
open markets are more susceptible to cross-contaminations than
supermarkets due to constant exposure to environmental factors
such as dust, rodents and insects, if the products displayed at the
open markets are received directly from the slaughter house, and
sold out at the end of the selling day, possibly the freshness may
be the reason for low contamination. In addition, depending on
the supermarket cutting process and storage conditions, once the
contaminated meat is introduced in the environment, several pack-
ages may become contaminated, and due to time duration between
the cutting and the consumption, the pathogen such as L. monocyt-
ogenes which grows in refrigeration temperature may increase. Fur-
thermore, the multidrug-resistant isolates are a public health
concern, since they may lead to a therapeutic failure.
