Abstract

A study was conducted to describe the epidemiology of Salmonella spp. in chickens, pigs, dairy cows, farm workers with and without livestock
contact, and children with diarrhea. Samples were collected in the Chiangmai and Lampoon provinces of northern Thailand during 2000–2003. A
total of 2141 samples were processed. The prevalences of Salmonella in chickens at the farm, slaughterhouse and chicken meat at the market were
4%, 9% and 57%, respectively. In pigs, the prevalence at the farm, slaughterhouse and pork at the market were 6%, 28% and 29%, respectively.
The prevalence of Salmonella in dairy cows was 3%. Salmonella was isolated from 36% of farm workers with livestock contact and 33% of those
with no livestock contact, and from 7% of diarrheal children at the hospital. The longitudinal study of Salmonella in pigs showed that the
incidences of Salmonella isolation at the farm, slaughterhouse, and market were 7%, 50% and 20%, respectively. The most frequently isolated
serotypes of Salmonella were Weltevreden in chickens and humans, and Rissen in pigs. Serotypes varied between farm, slaughterhouse and
market for isolates from chickens and pigs. Antimicrobial resistance was present in isolates from all types of animals and humans in the study, with
widespread resistance to tetracycline and nalidixic acid. The proportions of resistant organisms among Salmonella from diarrheal children were
high, and higher proportions of multi-drug resistant organisms were observed among Salmonella isolates from farm workers with livestock contact
than among isolates from workers with no livestock contact.

1. Introduction

In Thailand, reports have shown the relationship between
Salmonella spp. in foods of animal origin and public health
problems (Rasrinual et al., 1988; Boriraj et al., 1997; Boonmar
et al., 1998a). Salmonella spp. are commonly found in chicken
eggs (Saitanu et al., 1994), and chicken (Sasipreeyajan et al.,
1996) and pork (Boonmar et al., 1997) meats at market. It has
been speculated that the source of the increase in S. Enterica
infection in humans in Thailand may be associated with the
increased prevalence of S. Enterica in chickens (Sakai and
Chalermchaikit, 1996), but
the evidence has not been
conclusive.

In addition to its pathogenicity, there has been concern about
antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella, which has lead to failure
of treatment for Salmonella and other bacterial pathogens

(Travers and Barza, 2002; Butt et al., 2003). Since foods of
animal origin are a major source of Salmonella spp., it has been
suggested that antimicrobial use in food animal production may
contribute to the presence of antimicrobial resistance in Sal-
monella spp. that infect humans (Cruchaga et al., 2001; Iovine
and Blaser, 2004). Studies in Thailand have found antimicrobial
resistance in Salmonella spp. isolated from food animals and
humans (Boonmar et al., 1998a; Hanson et al., 2002), including
resistance to relatively new antimicrobial agents such as
azithromycin and ciprofloxacin (Isenbarger et al., 2002). How-
ever, there is limited information on associations between the
Salmonella spp. isolated from food animals and those isolated
from humans. The purpose of this study was to further
investigate the epidemiology of Salmonella spp. in Thailand
by determining the prevalence of Salmonella spp. in 1) a variety
of food animal species and foods, from live animals on the farm
to foods available at the market; 2) humans with high and low
animal or animal product contact; and 3) farm, slaughterhouse
and market environments associated with these animals. In

infection for

addition to determining prevalence, serotypes of Salmonella
from food animals and humans were compared to identify any
common sources of
these groups. Finally,
antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted to describe
patterns of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella from food-
producing animals from farm to market, and in humans with
high and low animal or animal product contact. Results from
these studies could form a basis for risk assessment and future
interventions intended to reduce the incidence of Salmonella in
Thailand, and potential hazards from antimicrobial resistance in
Salmonella.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Study design

This study used Salmonella isolates collected during three
in which the epidemiology of
phases of a larger project
Salmonella in food animals and humans in Thailand was
examined. The phases were a cross-sectional phase, a
longitudinal study phase, and a case-control phase. The cross-
sectional study phase was conducted to estimate the prevalence
of Salmonella in chickens, swine, dairy cows, farm workers,
non-farm residents, and children hospitalized with diarrhea. The
longitudinal study was conducted to identify potential Salmo-
nella spp. contamination points in the pork production system
from farm to market. The case-control study was conducted to
identify risk factors associated with Salmonella spp. infection in
children hospitalized with diarrhea. The relationship among
Salmonella spp. isolated from various sources was determined
by serotyping, and comparison of antimicrobial resistance in
isolates from various animal species, locations and sample
types. The number of individual animal samples collected from
each farm was based on a true population prevalence of 50%, a
95% confidence level, and an estimated prevalence within 5%
of the true prevalence on the farm (Smith, 1995).

2.2. Sample collection

A total of 2150 samples were collected and processed (Table 1),
including 504 samples from humans. Samples were collected and
processed during the period May 2000 to July 2003. Due to
logistical constraints random sampling was not possible, and all
sampling sites were selected to be located in the Chiang Mai and
Lamphung provinces of northern Thailand within 3 h of the
laboratory. These study locations included farms, slaughterhouses,
fresh meat markets, and hospitals. In addition, the farms, slaugh-
terhouses and markets selected needed to keep records so that
animals could be tracked from the farm to the slaughterhouse, and
subsequently from slaughter to the markets.

Individual animals were randomly selected for sampling
based on their age and stage of production. Pigs b 1 month old
prior to slaughter, chickens b 2 weeks old prior to slaughter, and
milking cows were included in the on-farm study. The same pigs
and chickens were tracked and sampled at the slaughterhouse
and again at the markets. All workers on the farms participating
in the study, and workers at the slaughterhouses involved in the
study were asked to provide stool samples for the study. The
parents of all children with diarrhea in the hospitals within the
study area were contacted for participation while the children
were hospitalized. Due to the low numbers of farm workers,
slaughterhouse workers and children with diarrhea, efforts were
made to contact and enroll all possible candidates. Approvals to
conduct research involving human subjects and animals were
given by the Chiang Mai University Committees on Human
Subjects and Animal Research, respectively.

For the cross-sectional study, samples were collected once
from each study subject. For the longitudinal study, samples
were collected from the same animals at
the
slaughterhouse and market. At the farm, fecal samples were
collected from pigs and dairy cows by rectal evacuation, and
from chickens by cloacal swabs. Ten milliliter milk samples
were collected from dairy farms.

study did not use machinery for the slaughtering process.
After slaughter, the pigs were dehaired, eviscerated, and cut
into 6 pieces by hand. Pig carcasses, including visceral organs,
were delivered to the market directly after slaughtering. The
slaughterhouse samples were collected from the pigs at the
end of the butchering process but before shipment to market.
At the market, approximately 100 g of pork from the neck
and a thigh from each chicken were purchased. All farm,
slaughterhouse, and market environmental samples were
collected using a sterile gauze swab soaked in sterile skim
milk (Pacific Sciences, Bangkok, Thailand), which was used as
a transport medium for these samples. All samples were held in
an icebox or refrigerator until further processing, which was
completed within 48 h of collection.

Livestock-handling farm workers and farming neighbors
who did not have livestock contact were asked to submit 10 g
stool samples in sterile cups containing Cary–Blair transport
medium (Pacific Sciences, Bangkok, Thailand) provided by the
investigator. With parental consent, rectal swabs were collected
from children with diarrhea, prior to treatment with any
antimicrobial agents, at the study hospitals. Swabs were kept
in semi-solid Cary–Blair medium (Pacific Sciences) and held as
were fecal and environmental samples.

Pre-tested questionnaires were administered by the principal
investigator at the farm, to collect information regarding general
farm management and risk factors for Salmonella infection. To
ascertain the exposures of children with diarrhea to food
animals, pre-tested questionnaires on food consumption and
animal contact were administered to the consenting parents by
the same nurse who collected the stool specimen from the
hospitalized child.

2.3. Isolation and identification of Salmonella

Approximately 10 g of meat were excised from each pur-
chased sample and minced. All environmental swabs and meat
samples were placed in 10 ml of buffered peptone water (BPW;
Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) as pre-enrichment media, and incubated
at 37 °C for 18 h. After incubation, 0.1 ml of the BPW was added
to Rappaport–Varsiliadis broth (Pacific Sciences), an enrichment
media, and incubated at 42 °C for 18 h. A swab of the broth was
inoculated onto Xylose–Lysine–Turgitol agar (XLT4; Pacific
Sciences) selective media. Fecal, cloacal and rectal swabs were

At the slaughterhouse, samples were collected by swabbing
an area of approximately 50 cm on each pig carcass with sterile
gauze, and cotton swabs were used to swab under the wing and
around the cloaca of each chicken carcass. Samples of
mesenteric lymph nodes were collected from pigs after carcass
dressing. The sample source (carcass swab or lymph node) of
pig samples taken from the slaughterhouse in 2000 was lost —
data from these samples were included in reports of overall
prevalence, but were excluded in comparisons of prevalence of
Salmonella from different types of samples at slaughter.

The slaughterhouses participating in our study were small-
scale facilities providing meat for local market consumption.
The poultry slaughterhouses processed 500–800 birds per
night. At the slaughterhouse, birds from various farms were
kept together in the holding pen while waiting to be slaughtered
by hand. After mechanical defeathering, carcasses were chilled
in cold water without evisceration, since evisceration is done at
the market to provide consumers with viscera for separate
purchase. Chicken slaughterhouse samples were collected after
defeathering and before chilling. The pig slaughterhouse in this

inoculated directly on XLT4. The XLT4 plates were incubated at
37 °C for 24 h. Up to 5 colonies were selected from each plate and
were streaked on triple sugar iron agar (TSI; Pacific Sciences),
motility-indole-lysine decarboxylase media (MIL; Pacific
Sciences) and urea agar (Pacific Sciences) to confirm Salmonella
(Popoff and LeMinor, 1992). Positive colonies were streaked on
tryptic soy agar (TSA; Pacific Sciences) and incubated for 18 h at
37 °C, and then an isolated colony was stabbed into half-strength
nutrient agar (Pacific Sciences) in a 1.5 ml tube. After incubation
for 18 h at 37 °C of incubation, the tubes were stored at 4 °C.

2.4. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done using micro-
broth dilution, following guidelines set by the National
Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS, 2000),
and using Staphylococcus aureus NTCC 25922 and Escherichia
coli NTCC 29213 as quality control organisms. The antimicro-
bial agents tested included ampicillin, ceftiofur, ceftriaxone,
florfenicol, nalidixic acid, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin. A 105
CFU/ml bacterial suspension was inoculated into a 96 well
microtitre plate containing 2-fold dilutions of antimicrobial
agents. Plate counts were conducted to confirm the concentra-
tions of the inocula used in susceptibility testing. After
incubating the inoculated plate aerobically for 20 h,
the
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each antimicrobial
agent was determined by observing bacterial growth in each
well, and identifying the minimum concentration needed to
inhibit bacterial growth. The breakpoints provided by the US
National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System
(NARMS, 2003) were used to categorize Salmonella isolates
as resistant or non-resistant.

2.5. Statistical analysis

Prevalence was calculated by dividing the number of
samples positive for Salmonella by the total number of samples

processed. The significance (p b 0.05) of differences between
prevalences of Salmonella spp. in various population, location
and sample types were determined using the Chi-square test for
independent proportions, or McNemar's Chi-square test for
correlated proportions when comparing results of pig carcass
swabs with results from lymph nodes; or Fisher's Exact test
when the numbers within categories were too small for the Chi-
square test. Analysis of risk factors associated with Salmonella
isolation in children hospitalized with diarrhea was conducted
using the Chi-square or Fisher's Exact tests.

3. Results

3.1. Prevalence

The prevalence of Salmonella in animals varied between
species and between locations (Table 2), but the prevalence of
Salmonella was not significantly different (p N 0.05) between
pigs, chickens, or dairy cattle, regardless of sampling location.
There was no significant difference (p = 0.726) between food
animal species in the prevalence of Salmonella from environ-

mental samples (Table 3). The prevalence of Salmonella in
chickens at each farm was found to range from 6% to 75%, with
an average prevalence of 13%, and Salmonella was found in 12
out of 27 (44.4%) chicken farms sampled. The biggest
difference in prevalence by location for chickens was between
farm (4%) and slaughter (42%) (p b 0.01) At slaughter, the
prevalence of Salmonella in isolates from chicken cloacal swabs
was higher than carcass swab samples (Chi-square p b 0.01).
Four out of seven pig farms (57%) were found with Salmonella,
with the prevalences ranging from 2% to 25% (average 7%). At
slaughter, the prevalence from lymph node samples was not
significantly different from the prevalence observed from
carcass swab samples (McNemar p = 0.055).

In humans (Table 4), the prevalence of Salmonella spp. in
healthy adults (livestock farm workers, slaughterhouse wor-
kers and non-livestock farm workers) was
significantly
higher than in children hospitalized with diarrhea (p b 0.01).
Analysis of risk factors showed that gender, age, and con-
sumption of chicken, pork or milk were not significantly
associated with isolation of Salmonella from children with
diarrhea (Table 5).

3.2. Salmonella serotypes

The most commonly identified serotypes of Salmonella in
this study were Rissen and Weltevreden (Table 6), which were
found in all food animal species and humans, and Stanley was
found in pigs, cattle and humans. When separated by type of
sample and location (Table 7), samples from chickens on the
farm carried more serotypes than chickens at slaughter or
poultry meat, while pigs on the farm carried fewer serotypes
than animals at slaughter or meat at the market.

3.3. Antimicrobial resistance

Antimicrobial resistance was found in all types of animal and
human samples (Table 8). Resistance to ampicillin was common
in Salmonella isolated from healthy adult humans, while
resistance to ciprofloxacin was high in children with diarrhea.
Isolates resistant to more than one antimicrobial agent (multi-
resistant) were highest in chickens on the farm and children with
diarrhea. Livestock farm workers had higher levels of multi-
resistant Salmonella than farm workers with no livestock
contact.

4. Discussion

In food animals,

the prevalence of Salmonella was
consistently lower from samples collected from live animals
on the farm in comparison to samples collected after slaughter
and samples from meat purchased at the market. The prevalence
of Salmonella was low in environmental samples. In humans,
the prevalence of Salmonella in healthy adults was relatively
consistent, regardless of exposure to livestock.

The prevalence of Salmonella from chickens on the farm,
and the proportion of infected farms in our study, were lower
than previously reported in Thailand (Sasipreeyajan et al.,
1996). At slaughter, the prevalence of Salmonella found in this
study was much higher than that reported in a previous study in
Thailand (Vadhanasin et al., 2004). However, the slaughter-
house in the earlier study was a large processing plant, while
that in our study was small-scale local facility. The carcasses
were not eviscerated, as evisceration is commonly done at the
market since many consumers purchase the viscera for home
consumption. This practice may explain the increase in
prevalence at the market over the slaughterhouse, and why
our study found a much higher prevalence of Salmonella in
chicken meat than previous studies in Thailand (8%, Boonmar
et al., 1997) and the United Kingdom (8%, Meldrum et al.,
2004). However, our prevalence in market chicken was
comparable to results of studies in Portugal (60%, Antunes et
al., 2003), Spain (60%, Carramiñana et al., 1997), and Greece
(69%, Arvanitidou et al., 1998).

In pigs at slaughter, the prevalence of Salmonella from
carcass swabs in this study was higher than carcass swabs from
pigs in the U.K. (5.3%, Davies et al., 2004), but the prevalence
from lymph nodes was comparable to caecal contents of pigs at
slaughter
in the same study (23%). The prevalence of
Salmonella from meat at the market was slightly higher than

what was previously reported in Thailand (Boonmar et al.,
1997). Based on results from the prospective study of pigs from
farm to market, the high incidence of Salmonella at slaughter,
compared to the incidence at the farm and market, may indicate
that transport stress may cause pigs to shed Salmonella more
frequently (Berends et al., 1996).

This study supports other researchers in finding that cattle
have relatively low levels of Salmonella in comparison to other
food animal species. The prevalence of Salmonella in individual
dairy cattle in this study was comparable to other studies of
healthy cattle (Wells et al., 2001; Huston et al., 2002; Fossler et
al., 2004). The farm prevalence reported in this study was
higher than some studies of Salmonella in the U.S. (28%, Wells
et al., 2001; 31%, Huston et al., 2002), but was comparable to
the prevalences for individual farm visits (31%–54%) reported
in a longitudinal study of dairy farms in the midwestern and
northeastern U.S. (Fossler et al., 2004).

The proportion of samples yielding Salmonella in this study
was fairly consistent between the three healthy adult groups,
especially between livestock farm workers and farm workers
with no livestock contact. These levels were higher than those
reported in a study of U.S. military troops in Thailand, where
12% of healthy subjects carried Salmonella (Sanders et al.,
2002). The percentage of Salmonella isolates from children with
diarrhea was low, and agrees with findings from other studies
that indicate that Salmonella is not a significant cause of diarrhea
in children (3%, Suwatano, 1997; 7%, Murphy et al., 1993; 8%,
Echeverria et al., 1993; 12%, Rasrinual et al., 1988). Differences
in the observed prevalence of Salmonella in humans within this
study may be the result of the different sample collection
protocols used for the human samples. Healthy individuals were
provided with instructions, and collected and submitted their
own stool specimens, while samples from diarrheal children
were taken with rectal swabs by nurses at
the hospital.
Consequently, the samples from healthy patients may have
become contaminated during sample collection. Analysis of
consumption of foods of animal origin as risk factors for finding
Salmonella in children with diarrhea were not significant, which
may be attributable to the fact that Salmonella was not an
important cause of diarrhea in this study. Other studies have also
failed to connect Salmonella infection with locally-produced
food consumption (Kapperud et al., 1998).

Factors that may affect prevalence include those that affect
detection of
the organism, such as sampling procedures,
bacterial isolation and identification methods; and factors that
directly influence prevalence, such as animal management,
slaughter practices, and cross-contamination (Bryan and Doyle,
1995; Uyttendaele et al., 1999). Differences in prevalence may
be the result of using different sample types (Hurd et al., 2004),
or different methods for detection of Salmonella (Pangloli et al.,
2003). Study design has an effect on the detection of
Salmonella. The cross-sectional nature of sample collection
for the majority of samples in this study make it difficult to
arrive at conclusions about changes in Salmonella prevalence,
serotype, or antimicrobial resistance over time, but much of the
published data on Salmonella prevalence was collected through
cross-sectional studies.

A variety of different serotypes were reported from human
and animals from different locations in this study. Our study
found that S. Weltevreden was the most common serotype of
Salmonella in chickens at slaughter and at
the market.
Weltevreden was also the most common serotype of
Salmonella in healthy humans, which agrees with an earlier
study in Thailand from 1993–2002, which found Weltevreden
to be the most common serotype from human samples
(Bangtrakulnonth et al., 2004). While the 1993–2002 study
also found that S. Enteritidis was the second most common
serovar identified in humans, the proportion of S. Enteritidis in
human samples began declining in 2001 (Bangtrakulnonth et
al., 2004), and our study found no Enteritidis in humans, and
only in a small proportion of isolates from chickens. There was
a reported increase in the incidence of S. Enteritidis in-
fections in humans in Thailand from 1990 to 1995, (Boriraj
et al., 1997), with a concurrent increase in the incidence of
S. Enteritidis in chickens (Sakai and Chalermchaikit, 1996).
Our study found very little S. Enteritidis, which may be due
to the fact
the source of Salmonella infections in
humans and chickens may have changed over time.

that

The most common Salmonella serotype found in pediatric
diarrhea patients in this study was Stanley, in contrast with
findings from sporadic diarrheal patients in hospitals in
Thailand from 1993–1996, where Enteritidis was the most
common serotype identified (Boonmar et al., 1998b). Stanley is
one of the Salmonella serotypes increasing in importance in
Thailand (Bangtrakulnonth et al., 2004), and in the numbers
from human samples in the U.S. since 1993 (CDC, 2003).
Given the relatively low number of Salmonella isolates
available for typing (15) from children with diarrhea, the fact
that Salmonella is not a significant cause of diarrhea in
Thailand (Rasrinual et al., 1988; Echeverria et al., 1993;
Murphy et al., 1993; Suwatano, 1997), and the low levels of
Enteritidis found throughout
the
importance of Enteritidis is waning in pediatric diarrhea cases
in Thailand.

it appears that

this study,

The predominant serotype found in dairy cows and in pigs
throughout all sampling locations was Rissen, an uncommon
serotype in the U.S. (CDC, 2003), and one that was not
identified in any food animals in studies in Canada (Guerin et
al., 2005). The increasing importance of Rissen in Thailand was
also reported in an earlier study, and its presence in water,
human, and food products suggested a waterborne or foodborne
reservoir (Bangtrakulnonth et al., 2004).

Several interesting trends were present when comparing the
serotypes of different types of samples from different location.
When comparing environmental source Salmonella serotypes
with serotypes from samples taken from live animals, the most
common serotypes found in dairy cattle environmental samples
(Weltevreden and Brunei) were among the most common
serotypes found in dairy cows. However, in chickens, the most
common serotype found in environmental samples were
Blockley and Emek, while the most common serotypes
found in live chickens were Emek, Enteritidis, and Rissen.
Given that the rates of Salmonella isolation were higher in
environmental samples than from live animals on the farm,

these findings suggest that sources other than livestock may be
more important contributors to Salmonella in the farming
environment.

The most common serotypes found in farm workers from
chicken farms were Weltevreden and Rissen, Rissen from pig
farm workers, Anatum and Rissen from dairy farm workers, and
Anatum and Weltevreden in farm workers with no exposure to
livestock. Serotype Anatum in Thailand appears to be
associated with non-poultry food products and water contam-
ination (Bangtrakulnonth et al., 2004). Interestingly, the most
common serotypes of chickens (Emek and Enteritidis) did not
match the most common serotypes found in chicken farm
workers, suggesting that transmission between chickens and
farm workers may not be a significant source of Salmonella for
either group. One study has shown that
the serotype of
Salmonella in humans may not be related to animals living in
close contact with these humans (Kariuki et al., 2002). Serotype
Rissen was relatively common in farm workers with livestock
exposure, which may indicate a common source of this serotype
for all farm workers. When comparing farm workers with
livestock exposure and those with no livestock exposure, one
interesting pattern is the higher levels of serotypes Anatum and
Weltevreden in farm workers with no livestock exposure. These
Salmonella are probably acquired from farm sources not
associated with food animals.

The shift in serotypes from farm to slaughterhouse and
market may be indicative of contamination at slaughter and
market, when serotypes not found on the farm emerge at
slaughter, such as the emergence of S. Hadar and S. Weltevreden
in chickens at slaughter, and the decline in the percentage of
Salmonella isolates of serotype Rissen in pigs as they move
from farm to market. Given the higher levels of serotype
Weltevreden in humans, it would appear that humans might be
serving as a source of Salmonella contamination for chickens
and pigs as they move from farm to market. Other studies have
also identified shifts in predominant serotypes as food animals
move through different stages from farm to market (Korsak et
al., 2003; Bahnson et al., 2005).

Antimicrobial resistance was found in all types of samples
from all species investigated in this study. High proportions of
Salmonella spp. with resistance to tetracycline were found in all
host species. Low levels of
resistance to ciprofloxacin,
ceftriaxone and ceftiofur were observed, which may be due to
the limited use of these classes of antimicrobial agents in food
animal production, and were in agreement with previous studies
conducted in Thailand (Leelarasamee and Tian-Grim, 1994;
Boonmar et al., 1998a; Isenbarger et al., 2002). For both pigs
and chickens, the proportions of resistant Salmonella spp. were
highest at the farm, suggesting the higher risk of developing
resistance or acquiring Salmonella spp. with resistance to
antimicrobial agents occurred at
the farm (McEwen and
Fedorka-Cray, 2002). A high proportion of isolates resistant to
nalidixic acid were collected from chickens at the farm, where
quinolone use is common. In chickens, the increase in resistance
seen from slaughter to market may be due to evisceration at the
market rather than at slaughter, or through contamination of the
market environment.

Multi-drug resistance has been reported as an emerging
problem in poultry isolates from Thailand (Boonmar et al.,
1998a). Multi-resistant isolates were highest for chickens at the
farm and lowest at slaughter, while multi-resistance was highest
for pig isolates at slaughter. The differences in slaughter
practices concerning evisceration may explain these patterns, in
that multi-resistance was higher in isolates from locations where
fecal contamination was highest. For pigs, evisceration occurred
at the slaughter plant, and the cleaning of carcasses and meat
prior to marketing could impact the carriage of multi-resistant
Salmonella on meat at the market.

In humans, the proportion of resistant Salmonella spp. in
those isolates from diarrhea patients was higher
than in
Salmonella spp.
isolated from healthy individuals for all
antimicrobial agents. High levels of multi-resistant Salmonella
have been reported in Thai children with diarrhea (Moolasart et
al., 1997). The levels of resistance to tetracycline, ciprofloxacin,
and nalidixic acid in pediatric cases from this study were higher
in comparison to an earlier study in Thailand, where resistance
to these agents were 59%, b1% and 21%,
respectively
(Isenbarger et al., 2002). These differences may be associated
with differences in bacterial culture and antimicrobial suscep-
tibility testing techniques, or
they may be indicative of
increasing antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella infecting
young diarrhea patients in Thailand. Levels of resistance to
ampicillin and tetracycline in healthy adults from this study
were comparable to results reported for isolates collected from
diarrhea patients and controls in Thailand from 1981–1995
(Hoge et al., 1998). Interestingly, there were high levels of
ciprofloxacin resistance in children with diarrhea in our study
compared to low levels in the healthy adult population, and little
or no ciprofloxacin resistance in Salmonella isolates from
earlier studies (Hoge et al., 1998; Isenbarger et al., 2002). This
may be a reflection of the emergence of ciprofloxacin resistance
in Salmonella in Thailand, as seen in Campylobacter and other
enteropathogenic organisms (Hoge et al., 1998; Hanson et al.,
2002; Isenbarger et al., 2002).

In conclusion, Salmonella was found in all levels of food
production systems, from farm to market, in northern Thailand.
Antimicrobial resistance was present in Salmonella from all
stages of food production, and Salmonella serotypes changed as
animals moved from farm to market. In humans, Salmonella
was present in farm workers regardless of their level of contact
with livestock. For children hospitalized with diarrhea, the
prevalence of Salmonella was lower than in farm workers, but
those isolates had much higher levels of antimicrobial resistance
than isolates from healthy adults. The results of this study
demonstrate that
the epidemiology of Salmonella in food
animals and humans in Thailand is complicated, and further
research is needed to understand this system so that the risks of
disease and antimicrobial resistance for both humans and food
animals can be minimized.
