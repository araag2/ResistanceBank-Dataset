Identiﬁcation of Enterobacteriaceae harbouring the plasmid-mediated transferable colistin resistance gene
mcr-1 presents a new challenge to public health. The aim of this study was to characterise multidrug-
resistant Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) harbouring the mcr-1 gene on plasmids cultured
from pigs in China. Using CHROMagar™ ECC plates combined with stx gene detection by PCR, 93 STEC
were recovered from 326 faecal, 351 small intestine content and 326 colon content samples taken from
healthy pigs in 2011 and 2012 in China. This study, in which ten colistin-resistant isolates with minimum
inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 8–12 mg/L were identiﬁed and found to be positive by PCR for the
mcr-1 gene, is a follow-up to an earlier investigation. Plasmid proﬁling by S1-nuclease digestion followed
by pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) identiﬁed several high-molecular-weight plasmids and these
were typed by PCR-based replicon typing (PBRT). Two of the ten isolates, namely STEC-CQ09 (O116:H11/
CC23/ST88) and CQ10 (O2:H32/ST3628), were selected for further study as described in this report.

1. Introduction

Plasmids carrying antimicrobial resistance-encoding genes
can arise from multiple sources and be disseminated by horizon-
tal gene transfer. This feature limits the available chemotherapeutic
treatment options, leading to an ever-increasing reliance on
compounds such as tigecycline and colistin. The increase in

carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae has resulted in a
greater reliance on the use of polymyxin B and polymyxin E (co-
listin), with the inevitable risk of emerging resistance among bacteria
[1]. Colistin belongs to the family of polymyxins, which are cat-
ionic polypeptides, that target the lipid A component of the
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure. These compounds have a broad
spectrum of activity against Gram-negative bacteria [1]. Colistin is
indicated for use in food-producing animals and very low rates of
resistance have been reported. Where resistance does arise, asso-
ciated mechanisms, until recently, have been mediated by
chromosomally located genes (e.g. pmrAB, phoPQ and its negative
regulator mgrB) [2]. A transferrable colistin resistance-encoding gene,
mcr-1, has been detected in food, animals and humans in different
species across the word [1,3–6]. Considering the importance of co-
listin in the treatment in human infections and its use in food-
producing animals in China and elsewhere, identiﬁcation of the mcr-1
gene in food-producing animals presents a new challenge to vet-
erinary public health.

Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is recognised as an
important human pathogen causing diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis

and haemolytic–uraemic syndrome [7]. Swine play an important
role as a carrier of this pathogen [8]. In this study, 93 STEC iso-
lates were retrospectively assessed for the presence of the mcr-1
gene by PCR [1]. The MCR-1 resistance mechanism appears to have
spread to extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing STEC
cultured from pigs.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Bacterial study collection

In an earlier study, 93 STEC were collected from 326 faecal, 351
small intestine content and 326 colon content samples taken from
healthy pigs between May 2011 and August 2012 at sites located
in Beijing, Chongqing and Guizhou Province in China. One gram of
each sample was enriched in 5 mL of modiﬁed tryptone soya broth
supplemented with novobiocin (10 mg/L) (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke,
UK) and was incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h. Isolation of STEC micro-
organisms was carried out using CHROMagar™ ECC plates
(CHROMagar, White City, OR) combined with the stx PCR detec-
tion method [8].

2.2. Detection of the mcr-1 gene by standard PCR

Primers for the mcr-1 gene as described previously were used

to screen the study isolates [1].

2.3. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for all mcr-
1-positive isolates by agar disk diffusion (Oxoid Ltd.; Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc Inc.). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of co-
listin (Sigma, St Louis, MO) was determined by broth dilution
according the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibil-
ity Testing (EUCAST) (http://www.eucast.org; accessed 22 March
2016). E. coli ATCC 25922 was included as a quality control strain.
Results were interpreted according to the criteria of the Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [9] and EUCAST.

2.4. Plasmid proﬁling

Plasmid DNA proﬁles of ten colistin-resistant STEC isolates and
their corresponding transconjugants were obtained using the S1-
nuclease pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) molecular subtyping
method [10].

2.5. PCR-based replicon typing (PBRT)

Eighteen pairs of primers were used to determine the plasmid
incompatibility (Inc) types by PBRT using puriﬁed genomic DNA as
template [11].

2.6. Conjugation-based mating experiments and veriﬁcation

Two of the mcr-1-positive STEC isolates (STEC-CQ09 and -CQ10)
were selected for conjugation experiments and were analysed in-
dividually for their ability to transfer the colistin resistance gene
to the plasmid-free recipient E. coli J53 (sodium azide-resistant). Con-
jugation experiments were carried out using a broth mating protocol
[10]. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were again performed to
conﬁrm plasmid transfer, followed by S1-nuclease PFGE, PBRT and
PCR as described previously.

2.7. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and phylogenetic analysis

Genomic DNA was sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 plat-
form (Illumina, San Diego, CA) generating 90-bp paired-end reads
from a library with an average insert size of 500 bp and a total
amount of quality-ﬁltered raw sequence of >550 Mbp per isolate.
Reads were assembled de novo using SOAPdenovo v.2.04 [12]. The
core genome-based phylogeny was determined by Harvest Suite [13]
and a maximum composite likelihood phylogenetic tree was
generated by MEGA v.6 software (http://www.megasoftware.net/)
using E. coli MG1655 as reference. Accession numbers were as-
signed as follows: FLOA01000000 (STEC-CQ09); and FLOF01000000
(STEC-CQ10).

3. Results and discussion

Among the previous isolate collection of 93 STEC, 10 colistin-
resistant isolates were identiﬁed and were denoted as STEC-
CQ01, -CQ02, -CQ03, -CQ04, -CQ05, -CQ06, -CQ07, -CQ08, -CQ09,
-CQ10. The mcr-1 gene was identiﬁed by PCR in all ten of these iso-
lates. The colistin-resistant isolates were additionally resistant to
several compounds in different antimicrobial classes including
aminoglycosides, aminopenicillins, cephalosporins, ﬂuoroquinolones,
phenicols, tetracyclines, trimethoprim and sulphonamides (Table 1).
S1-nuclease-based PFGE proﬁling experiments identiﬁed small and
large plasmids ranging in size from 40 kbp to 250 kbp in the ten
colistin-resistant isolates, of which STEC-CQ01, -CQ02, -CQ03, -CQ04,
-CQ05, -CQ06, -CQ07, -CQ08 and -CQ10 had an indistinguishable

plasmid proﬁle (data not shown). Similarly, data from the previ-
ous study showed that nine of the ten colistin-resistant isolates had
the same sequence types (STs) and produced near indistinguish-
able pulsotypes following macrorestriction analysis (data not shown).
Based on these results, STEC-CQ09 (O116:H11/CC23/ST88) and STEC-
CQ10 (O2:H32/ST3628) were selected for further investigation,
including conjugation-based mating experiments and WGS fol-
lowed by subsequent data mining for selected features.

Broth microdilution was used to determine the MIC of colistin
and MICs values of 8–12 mg/L were recorded (Table 1). The genome
sequences of STEC-CQ09 and -CQ10 isolates were queried for the
presence of the mcr-1 gene and both were found to possess this gene;
a feature that was conﬁrmed by use of a previously described PCR
assay [1]. The mcr-1 gene sequence was located in the same genetic
context as that previously reported, being distal to insertion se-
quence element ISApl1 (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). Analysis of
the sequence data obtained from STEC-CQ09 and -CQ10 separate-
ly identiﬁed a 1626-bp contig that contained the mcr-1-encoding
gene and that was a perfect match with the structure reported by
Liu et al [1]. The colistin resistance genes of STEC-CQ09 and -CQ10
were successfully transferred by conjugation into sodium azide-
resistant E. coli J53. The transfer frequency for STEC-CQ09 was
1.6 × 10–2, which is similar to that reported previously [1], but was
lower in the case of STEC-CQ10 (2.2 × 10–7). Analysis of the plasmid
proﬁles in these transconjugants identiﬁed an IncI2 replicon type
in the STEC-CQ09(T) transconjugant and IncN and IncHI2 replicon
types in the STEC-CQ10(T) transconjugant. Additional mutations in
other genes reported to be associated with colistin resistance were
also identiﬁed, including the two-component sensor systems phoP/
phoQ and pmrA/pmrB, and in the case of STEC-CQ09 mutations were
detected in the phosphatidylethanolamine transferase-encoding eptB
gene that mediates modiﬁcation of the outer Kdo (3-deoxy-d-
manno-octulosonic acid) monosaccharides of LPS [2].

One of the isolates (STEC-CQ09) was found to be resistant to most
of the drug classes tested (Table 1). Based on WGS, several resistance-
encoding genes were identiﬁed and these included: AmpC
β-lactamases encoded by blaCMY-2, blaCFE-1 in STEC-CQ09 and blaCMY-104
in STEC-CQ10; and EBSL-encoding genes including blaCTX-M-55 in STEC-
CQ09 and blaCTX-M-65 with blaTEM-1 in STEC-CQ10, which has been
reported in other countries among different Enterobacteriaceae along
with co-resistance to other antimicrobial compounds such as ESBLs
or metallo-β-lactamases [4,14,15]. Data obtained from PCR-based
genotyping assays [10] carried out on the remaining eight isolates
showed that these carried the same ESBL genes as identiﬁed in STEC-
CQ10. Streptomycin resistance-encoding genes strAB were also found
along with aadA1, aadA2 and aph(3′)-Ia in both of the sequenced
isolates; as well as sulphonamide resistance encoded by sul1 and
sul3 along with sul2 in STEC-CQ09; and tetracycline resistance encoded
by tet(A) in both isolates. Genotypes associated with trimethoprim
resistance were encoded by dfrA12 in both isolates along with dfrA14
in STEC-CQ10. The ermB and mphA genes were identiﬁed in STEC-
CQ09, which encode resistance to erythromycin. Two phenicol
resistance eﬄux transporters cmlA1 and ﬂoR were identiﬁed in all
isolates and the latter gene has also been reported in an mcr-1 E. coli
isolate [16], where it was located distal to the IS6100 element in
STEC-CQ09, a feature that has been previously reported and one that
may contribute to the dissemination of this genotype, following use
of this compound in swine production. All ten colistin-resistant iso-
lates were co-resistant to nalidixic acid, and in the case of STEC-
CQ09, this isolate was additionally resistant to ciproﬂoxacin and
norﬂoxacin (Supplementary Table S1) with mutations being iden-
tiﬁed in target genes associated with the type II topoisomerase-
encoding genes (gyrA, parC and parE). In the case of STEC-CQ10, two
plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants (qnrS1
and oqxA) were identiﬁed, which were also reported to be co-
located on the mcr-1 plasmid in one isolate from Vietnam [17].

Both of the sequenced isolates were found to carry virulence-
encoding genes, including stx2e and ehxA, along with the fedF-
encoding gene that is responsible for the production of adhesive
ﬁmbriae. In addition, the sepA gene was one of the plasmid pAA-
encoded virulence genes found in STEC-CQ10. Other virulence-
related genes identiﬁed included the sta- and stb-encoding genes
(which elaborate the component elements of the heat-stable toxin)
and the lpfA gene that encodes ﬁmbrial adhesins, both of which were
identiﬁed in the genome of STEC-CQ09 alone.

4. Conclusion

Liu et al identiﬁed the plasmid-borne gene mcr-1 encoding re-
sistance to colistin with a high prevalence among E. coli isolates
cultured from pig populations in China [1]. This same gene has sub-
sequently been reported in other countries among different
Enterobacteriaceae along with co-resistance to other antimicro-
bial compounds such as ESBLs or metallo-β-lactamases [4,14,15].
The outbreak reported in 2011, which was ﬁrst detected in Germany,
was linked to STEC O104 that contained an ESBL complex (CTX-M-
15) and β-lactamase-encoding TEM-1 [7]. Of note, in this study, STEC-
CQ09 and -CQ10 were both positive for stx2e and fedF together with
being phenotypically resistant to ESBLs and colistin. Although STEC
harbouring stx2e affects animals and rarely causes illness in humans
[18], assessment of the transfer frequencies and features support-
ing the maintenance of mobile genetic elements containing the mcr-1
gene in human-associated E. coli and other Gram-negative patho-
gens is crucial to fully delineate the impact of these ﬁndings. These
data also highlight the need to monitor the use of colistin in the
treatment of both human and animal populations as well as the need
for active resistance surveillance to support improvements in in-
fection control practices to limit its further dissemination.
