Abstract A study was conducted to determine the
prevalence of mastitis, identify the major bacterial
pathogens and test the antimicrobial resistance of milk
bacterial isolates in smallholder dairy farms in Selalle
area, Ethiopia. A total of 109 smallholder dairy farms
comprising 500 crossbred lactating cows were includ-
ed. The prevalence of clinical mastitis at herd, cow
and quarter level was 8.3% (n=9), 1.8% (n=9) and
0.51% (n=10), respectively, while that of sub-clinical
mastitis was 54.7%, 22.3% and 10.1%, respectively.
The univariate logistic regression showed that among
the risk factors considered, presence of teat lesion,
stage of lactation and parity number had significant
effect on the prevalence of sub-clinical mastitis.
However, after multivariate analysis, only presence
of teat lesion and stage of lactation had significant
effect. The common isolates from the clinical mastitic
quarters were St. agalactiae (30%, n=3) and St.
dysgalactiae (30%, n=3), while from sub-clinical
cases were S. aureus (42.6%, n=83), S. epidermidis
(22.1%, n=43), St. agalactiae (12.8%, n=25) and St.

resistance for almost all

uberis (10.3%, n=20). Staphylococcus intermedius
and Streptococcus dysgalactiae were the species,
which showed high level of susceptibility for most
of the antimicrobials tested, while the remaining had
varying levels of
the
antimicrobials used. Among the antimicrobials
employed, erythromycin and sulphonamide showed
the lowest proportion of resistant isolates. Consider-
ing the possible significant economic losses that could
be incurred by both clinical and sub-clinical mastitis,
attention should be paid for further detailed inves-
tigations including the economic losses and benefits
of interventions in the study area.

Introduction

Ethiopia holds large potential for dairy development
due to its large cattle population and the favorable
climate for improved high yielding animal breeds.
Thus, the contributions of the dairy sector especially
the smallholder system in Ethiopia to poverty allevi-
ation and sustainable food production in the country
is assumed to be considerable, given the considerable
potential for income and employment generation from
high value dairy products. However, among many
factors the sector is constrained by mastitis, which
incurs serious economic losses to the dairy industry.

A number of previous reports from different parts
of the country indicated that mastitis is a serious
problem in the dairy industry of Ethiopia (Biru, 1989;
Bishi, 1998; Nesru, 1999; Mungube, 2001). However,
little has been done in Selalle area, which is located
within the Addis Ababa milk-shed, supplying a
considerable volume of milk to government and
private milk processing plants and having a high
potential for dairy production. Thus, this study was
initiated to estimate the prevalence of mastitis, isolate
the major bacterial pathogens and test their antimi-
crobial susceptibility and assess the major risk factors
associated with the occurrence of mastitis in small-
holder dairy farms in the Selalle area.

Materials and methods

Study area and study population

The study was conducted in Mullo-Sullulta District of
the North Shoa (Sellale area) Zone of Oromia, which
is located some 40 km northwest of the capital, Addis
Ababa. The total area coverage of the Selalle area is
11607 km2, while the altitude ranges from 1000 –
3500 meter above sea level (CSA, 2003). The mean
annual rainfall of the area is 1026 mm and the daily
mean maximum and minimum temperatures are 20.7
and 11.2 °C, respectively. The total cattle population
of the Zone is estimated to be 1,173543; while that of
Mullo-Sullulta District is 186,136 out of which 6,593
(3.5%) heads of cattle are crosses of Holstein and
indigenous breeds. The smallholder dairy farms in the
Mullo-Sullulta District represent the study population.

Study design and sampling procedure

A cross-sectional type of study was carried out to
investigate the prevalence of clinical and sub-clinical
mastitis at quarter, cow and herd level. Simple
random type of sampling was carried out to select
peasant associations and farms. All dairy cows in the
selected farms were sampled as a cluster. The total
number of animals sampled from the study area is
calculated using the formula for one stage cluster
sampling (Thrusfield, 1995). The considerations
during the sample size determination included: 95%
confidence interval, 5% precision and 60% of
prevalence from previous studies in the same study

area (Workineh et al., 2002). Accordingly, a total of
109 dairy farms comprising 500 lactating crossbred
cows were included in the study.

Clinical examination and California Mastitis Test
(CMT)

The selected smallholder dairy farms were visited
once (when the questionnaire survey, clinical exam-
ination and milk sampling were done in one visit) or
twice in few cases. Crossbred milking cows were
clinically examined for the diagnosis of mastitis.
Clinical mastitis was diagnosed on the basis of
manifestation of visible signs of inflammation. A
quarter, which was warm and swollen and had pain
upon palpation was considered to have acute clinical
mastitis, while misshaped, atrophied, hard and fibrotic
quarter was considered to have chronic mastitis (IDF,
1987).

The California Mastitis Test (CMT) was carried out
following the procedure described by Quinn et al.
(1994) as screening test for sub-clinical mastitis and
for further bacteriological examination. The test result
was interpreted based on the thickness of the gel
formed by CMT reagent and milk mixture and scored
as negative (o),
trace (T), + (weak positive), ++
(distinctive positive), and +++ (strong positive).
Quarters with CMT score of + or above were judged
as positive. Cows were considered positive for CMT,
when at least one quarter turned out to be positive for
CMT. A herd was considered positive for CMT, when
at least one cow in a herd was tested positive with
CMT.

Collection of milk samples

Milk samples were collected from all the quarters
(unless they were blind) of the sampled cows by
standard milk sampling techniques (Sears et al., 1993;
Quinn et al., 1994). After a quarter had been washed
with tap water and dried, the teat end was swabbed
with cotton soaked in 70% ethyl alcohol. Approxi-
mately 10 ml of milk was collected into a sterile
universal vial after discarding the first three milking
streams. Samples were placed in an icebox and
transported to the National Animal Health Research
Center at Sebeta and stored at +4°C for a maximum
of 24 hours (h) until
they were inoculated into
standard bacteriological media.

Bacteriological examination of milk samples

Milk samples were examined following the standard
procedures (Sears et al., 1993; Quinn et al., 1994).
About 10 μl of each milk sample was streaked on 5%
blood agar. The inoculated plate then was incubated
aerobically at 37 °C for up to 72 h. The plates were
examined for growth, morphology and hemolytic
features at 24, 48 and 72 h after inoculation. Plates
were considered culture negative,
if no growth
occurred within 72 h. Bacteria on culture-positive
plates were identified according to their gram-stain
reaction, colony morphology and hemolytic features.
Based on the above results, suspected colonies were
isolated on to blood agar plates for further investiga-
tion. Then growth on MacConkey agar, catalase test,
oxidase test, O-F test and motility test were used for
primary identification and Indole test, Methylene Red
test, Voges-Proskauer test and Urease test were used
as secondary biochemical tests (Sears et al., 1993;
Quinn et al., 1994). The interpretation was made as
provided by National Mastitis Council (NMC, 1990).
Isolation of two (if neither of the two colonies is a
recognized pathogen) or more types of colonies from
a quarter sample were considered as contaminated and
the results were disregarded.

Antimicrobial sensitivity test

Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method (Carter and
Chengappa, 1991) was employed to test the in-vitro
antibiotic sensitivity of the isolates. The following
eight antimicrobial drugs were used: ampicillin
(AMP) (10 μg), penicillin G (PEN) (10IU), strepto-
mycin (STR) (10 μg), kanamycin (KAN) (30 μg),
(15 μg), polymixin B (PB)
erythromycin (ERY)
(300 μg), oxytetracycline (OXTE)
(30 μg), and
sulfonamide (SULPHA) (300 μg). The cut off values
for the evaluation of the susceptibility of isolates were
when the inhibition zone was greater than or equal to
29 mm, 30 mm and 17 mm for ampicillin (for
staphylococci, streptococci and other microorganisms,
respectively), 29 mm and 22 mm for penicillin G (for
staphylococci and other microorganisms, respective-
ly), 15 mm for streptomycin, 18 mm for kanamycin
and erythromycin, 12 mm for polymixin B, 19 mm
for oxytetracycline and 17 mm for sulphonamide. As
plating medium Mueller-Hinton agar and 5% sheep
blood agar were used for less fastidious bacterial

263

isolates and streptococci species, respectively. Antibi-
otic impregnated paper discs and plates were incubat-
ed at 37°c for 16–18 h.

Questionnaire survey

A structured questionnaire (pre-tested) with the
primary objective of elucidating the multi-factorial
background of bovine mastitis was conducted. Infor-
mation regarding cow and farm attributes, which
included parity number, stage of lactation (classified
into three: beginning of lactation referring to the first
two months of lactation period; middle of lactation
referring to the next five months period and end of
lactation referring to the last weeks of lactation
period), herd size, barn floor status (good if the farm
floor is made of concrete and bad if the floor is
muddy), milking hygiene (good if it fulfilled either of
the two of the practices including washing of hand
before milking, use of separate towel
for each
lactating cow and drying of udder after washing and
bad if not) and sequencing milking of mastitic cows
were collected.

Statistical analysis

Prevalence rates were calculated for clinical and sub-
clinical mastitis at herd, cow, and quarter level as
defined by the CMT score and bacteriological result.
The prevalence of sub-clinical mastitis was the
dependent variable while parity, stage of lactation,
herd size and presence of teat lesion were independent
variables considered at cow level. The independent
variables at herd level
included barn floor status,
milking hygiene and milking strategy. The associa-
tions between dependent and independent variables
were tested by logistic regression of Intercooled Stata
7.0 (STATA, 2000).

Results

Prevalence of clinical and sub-clinical mastitis

Among the total of 2000 quarters of the 500 lactating
cows, 45 quarters (2.3%) belonging to 37 cows were
blind and 17 quarters (0.9%) belonging to 16 cows
were affected by clinical mastitis. From cows having
blind quarters, 30 (81.1%) cows had only one blind

264

quarter, 6 (16.2%) cows had two blind quarters and 1
(2.7%) cow had three blind quarters. Fifteen (33.3%),
11 (24.6%), 10 (22.2%), and 9 (20.0%) of the blind
quarters were at the right rear, right front, left rear and
left front positions, respectively.

A total of 14 (12.8%) herds, 16 (3.2%) cows and
17 (0.9%) quarters had clinical mastitis while 77
(70.6%) herds, 147 (30.4%) cows and 264 (13.6%)
quarters had sub-clinical mastitis. The details of
prevalence rates of clinical and sub-clinical mastitis
and their respective bacterial culture results at herd,
cow and quarter levels are presented in Table 1. Out
of the 17 quarters, which were affected by clinical
mastitis, 4 (23.5%) and 13 (76.4%) were acute and
chronic form of mastitis, respectively. Mastitis caus-
ing bacteria were isolated in 9 herds (8.3%), 9 cows
(1.8%) and 10 quarters (0.5%) in clinical cases, while
the isolation rate was 59 (54.7%) at herd level, 108
(22.3%) at cow level and 195 (10.1%) at quarter level
from sub-clinical cases.

From the CMT negative quarters (n=1674), 70
(4.2%) were with trace reaction while from the CMT
positive quarters (13.6%, n=264), 4.1% (n=80), 4.1%
(n=79), and 5.4% (n=105) were weak, moderate and
strong reactors, respectively. Seventy-one (26.9%), 67
(25.4%), 67 (25.4%) and 59 (22.3%) of the CMT
positive quarters were found in the right rear, right
front, left rear and left front quarters, respectively. The
difference in prevalence between the quarters was not
statistically significant (p>0.05).

Risk factors associated with sub-clinical mastitis

The univariate logistic regression analysis revealed
that stage of lactation (p<0.05), parity number (p<
0.05) and presence of
lesion (p<0.01) had
significant effect on the prevalence of sub-clinical
mastitis at cow level. These risk factors that had

teat

significant effect in univariate analysis were fitted in a
multivariate model and only stage of lactation (p<
0.05) and presence of
lesion (p<0.01) had
significant effect. The prevalence rates were higher
in cows that were at the end of their lactation period
(OR=1.5) and with teat lesions (OR=6.2) (Table 2).
All the farm attributes considered (barn floor status,
milking hygiene and milking of mastitic cows at last)
had no significant effect on the prevalence of sub-
clinical mastitis at cow level. Moreover, the effects of
the potential risk factors at herd level were analyzed
using univariate logistic regression and the results
revealed that none of the factors considered had
significant effect on the prevalence of sub-clinical
mastitis at herd level (p>0.05) (Table 2).

Bacterial isolates

The list, number and proportion of the bacterial
isolates from a total of 117 cows (205 quarters) are
presented in Table 3. A total of 205 isolates were
found, of which 10 (4.9%) were from milk samples
collected from clinical mastitic quarters, while the
remaining 195 (95.1%) were from sub-clinical cases.
From sub-clinical cases, 191 (97.9%) isolates showed
single growth, while 4 (2.1%) had mixed growths.
The common isolate from the clinical mastitic
quarters were St. agalactiae (30%, n=3) and St.
dysgalactiae (30%, n=3), while from sub-clinical
cases were S. aureus (42.6%, n=83), S. epidermidis
(22.1%, n=43), St. agalactiae (12.8%, n=25) and St.
uberis (10.3%, n=20). Other
isolates include S.
intermedius, St. dysgalactiae, Micrococcus species,
B. cereus, A. pyogenes, E. coli, and C. bovis.

Based on their

importance, 8 (80%) and 134
(70.2%) of the isolates from the clinical and sub-
clinical mastitic cases, respectively were major patho-
gens, while the remaining were minor pathogens.

Among the major pathogens the predominant isolate
was S. aureus (61%) and that of minor pathogens was
S. epidermis (78.2%). Based on their origin, 80% and
60.7% of the isolates from the clinical and sub-
clinical mastitic cases, respectively, were contagious
pathogens, while the remaining were environmental
pathogens. Among the contagious pathogens,
the
predominant isolate was S. aureus from both clinical
(77%) and sub-clinical (71.6%) cases. Among the
environmental pathogens, S. epidermis (57.3%) was
the most frequently isolated bacteria from the sub-
clinical cases.

In-vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test

The results of antimicrobial sensitivity test for the
different isolates are presented in Table 4. Isolates of
S. aureus showed moderate to very high resistance to
ampicillin (53.4%), penicillin 45.3%, streptomycin
(63.4%) and polymixin B (97.7%). S. epidermidis
isolates were highly resistant to polymixin B (95.2%),
oxytetracycline (83.3%) and ampicillin (70.8%). St.
agalactiae isolates showed the highest resistance for
kanamycin (53.8%). Substantial isolates of St. uberis
were susceptible for most of the tested antimicrobials

except kanamycin. Among the antimicrobial agents
tested, erythromycin (except for A. pyogenes) and
sulphonamides showed the lowest proportion of
resistant isolates of all the isolated bacteria. Generally,
the current antimicrobial sensitivity test indicated that
the responses of the various milk bacterial isolates to
different antimicrobial agents were variable.

Discussion

it

The overall prevalence of clinical mastitis and
subsequent culture results at cow level in this study
(2.6%) is in agreement with the reports of Mungube
(2001) (3.6%) and Bishi (1998) (4.4%) in peri-urban
and urban production systems in Ethiopia. The overall
prevalence of sub-clinical mastitis (22.3%) is also in
agreement with the reports of Nesru et al. (1997)
(19%) in local and exotic cattle in Ethiopia and that of
Klastrup and Halliwell (1997) (17–19%) in Malawi.
However,
is lower than those of Abaineh and
Sintayehu (2001) (34.6%) and Sori et al. (2005)
(36.7%) in local and crossbred dairy cows in the
central highlands and Workineh et al. (2002) (45.4%)
in commercial farms in Ethiopia. Our finding is by far
lower than the reports of Kerro and Tareke (2003) in
local, Friesian and Jersey cows in Southern Ethiopia
(62.9%) and Kivaria et al. (2004) (90.3%) in lactating
cows in smallholder farms in Tanzania. Variations in
herd size, management practices, proportion of exotic
gene inheritance, agro-climates and other risk factors
might have contributed to the observed differences in

prevalence rates of mastitis among the findings of the
various workers.

The farm attributes considered in the current study
(barn status, milking hygiene and milking mastitic
cows at last) did not have significant effect on the
prevalence of sub-clinical mastitis. However,
the
importance of these farm attributes in determining
the prevalence of mastitis was indicated by Kivaria et
al. (2004), Sori et al. (2005) and Mungube et al.
(2004). The homogeneity of the production environ-
ment under smallholder’s condition and the little
difference in farm hygienic practices could have
contributed for the lack of significant effect of the
farm attributes.

The significant effect of stage of lactation on
prevalence of sub-clinical mastitis in this study was
also reported by Nesru (1999), Mungube et al. (2004),
Kerro and Tareke (2003) and Biffa et al. (2005) in
Ethiopia. The former two authors reported higher
prevalence of sub-clinical mastitis for cows in mid
and late stage of lactation as it is the case in our
findings, while the later two reported higher preva-
lence in early stage of lactation. The variations in the
effect of stages of lactation between the different
studies could be related probably to the disparities in
age, parity and breed of the sampled animals. In the
current work, the prevalence of sub-clinical mastitis
was significantly higher in cows with teat lesions.
Similar findings were reported by Sori et al. (2005),
Kerro and Tareke (2003) and Biffa et al. (2005) where
the prevalence of sub-clinical mastitis was signifi-
cantly higher in cows with teat lesions.

The isolation of substantial number of staphylo-
coccal (66.2%) and streptococcal (24.6%) species as
causes of sub-clinical mastitis in this study is in
agreement with the findings of Workineh et al.
(2002), Sori et al. (2005), Kerro and Tareke (2003)
and Abdella (1996) in Ethiopia and Mdegela et al.
(2005) in Tanzania. The common and most important
isolate found in this study was S. aureus (42.6%),
which is similar to the findings of Nesru et al. (1997),
Abdella (1996) (47%) and Sori et al. (2005) (44%).
The high prevalence S. aureus may be attributed to
wide distribution of the organisms in teat canals and
lesions, on teat and udder skin, and also in infected
udder (McDonald, 1997; Jones et al., 1998). It is
difficult to eliminate the bacteria from the mammary
gland due to the very low rate of self cure and a
number of
the rate of cure after
treatment which is in general low (Chamings, 1984;
Sol et al., 1995)

factors affect

The antimicrobial sensitivity test indicated that the
responses of the various milk bacterial
isolates to
different antimicrobial agents were variable. Among
the isolated pathogens, S. aureus and S. epidermidis
were more susceptible to kanamycin and erythromy-
cin and showed strong resistance to polymixin B. The
same kinds of susceptibility pattern results were
reported by Nesru (1997) in Ethiopia and Mdegela
et al. (2005) in Tanzania. The variations in suscepti-
bility of the isolated pathogens to the different drugs
may be attributed to the prevailing differences on
frequency and type of antibiotic treatments employed
at the smallholder level. A previous report indicated
that
the repeated use of antimicrobials against
pathogens causing sub-clinical mastitis increases
selection pressure for development of drug resistant
bacterial strains (Pyorala and Vesa, 1995). Further-
more, it is an established fact that Staphylococcus
species produce β-lactamase, which can cleave the β-
lactam ring of Beta-lactam antibiotics (Brumfitt and
Hamilton-Miller, 1989).
Interestingly, among the
antimicrobial agents tested, erythromycin (except for
A. pyogenes) and sulphonamides showed the least
proportion of resistant
the bacteria
tested. This finding is most probably attributed to the
rare use of the drugs in the treatment of bovine
mastitis in Ethiopia. On the other hand, the other
antibiotics tested are employed for the treatment of
mastitis more frequently due to their availability and
price by smallholder farmers in Ethiopia.

Conclusion

In view of our findings and similar previous studies,
the prevalence of mastitis is moderate and major
pathogenic microorganisms were involved in both
clinical and sub-clinical mastitis in the study area.
Cow attributes including presence of teat lesion and
stage of lactation influenced the prevalence of sub-
clinical mastitis. It is essential thus for the smallholder
dairy owners in the study area to avoid teat injury,
monitor the udder health status regularly and imple-
ment control strategies as required. Awareness should
also be created among smallholder farmers about the
economic impacts and benefits of controlling mastitis.
The antimicrobial sensitivity test showed most milk
bacterial isolates including the major pathogens had
multiple but variable resistance pattern. Therefore,
farmers need to be advised to avoid the frequent use
of one type of antimicrobial for a long period and the
need to consult animal health professionals for
prescription and administration of drugs.
