Running title: Drug-resistant bacteria in Ugandan livestock 

This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. 

Abstract 

Antimicrobial resistant bacteria (ARB) in livestock are a global public health concern, 

not only because they prolong infectious diseases but also they can be transferred from 

animals to humans via the food chain. Here, we studied ARB in livestock at commercial and 

subsistence farms (n = 13) in Wakiso and Mpigi districts, Uganda. We inquired from the 

farmers about the type and the purpose of antimicrobial agents they have used to treat their 

livestock. After collecting feces, we isolated antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli from 

livestock feces (n = 134) as an indicator bacterium. These strains showed resistance to 

ampicillin (44.8%), tetracycline (97.0%), and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (56.7%). The 

frequency of ampicillin-resistance was significantly correlated with the usage of penicillins to 

 

livestock in the farms (P = 0.04). The metagenomics data detected 911 antimicrobial resistant 

genes that were classified into 16 categories. Genes for multidrug efflux pumps were the 

most prevalent category in all except in one sample. Interestingly, the genes encoding 

third-generation cephalosporins (blaCTX-M), carbapenems (blaACT), and colistin (arnA) were 

detected by metagenomics analysis although these phenotypes were not detected in our E. 

coli strains. Our results suggest that the emergence and transmission of cephalosporin, 

carbapenem, and/or colistin-resistant bacteria among livestock can occur in future if these 

antimicrobial agents are used.

Introduction 

Emergence and distribution of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB) is a global public 

health concern (World Health Organization, 2014). ARB in food-producing animals are an 

important issue, not only for animal health and animal welfare but also public health, because 

ARB can be transmitted to humans via the food-chain (Marshall and Levy, 2011; WHO, 

2014). ARB are also an economic burden for farmers because of costs incurred in treatment 

failure and prolonged period of treatment of the bacterial infections (Bengtsson and Greko, 

2014). Antimicrobial agents have been used in livestock as a growth promoter, which may 

increase selective pressure on ARB (Marshall and Levy, 2011). National surveillance and 

monitoring system for ARB in livestock has been instituted in several countries (WHO, 

 

2014). However, the frequency and occurrence of ARB in many Sub Saharan African 

countries are still unclear.

Escherichia coli is often utilized as an indicator bacterium for antimicrobial resistance 

of Gram-negative bacteria because it is a commensal bacterium in gut microbiota (Varga et 

al., 2008). In addition, antimicrobial resistance in E. coli is important because it can cause 

diseases in both humans and animals. In veterinary medicine, E. coli causes infections such 

as mastitis in cows, diarrhea in calves, and colibacillosis in piglets and chickens. (Bradley, 

2002; Dziva and Stevens 2008; Luppi 2017). Since antimicrobial-resistant genes are often 

encoded on transferable genetic elements such as plasmids, E. coli can easily receive 

antimicrobial-resistance genes from other bacteria via horizontal transfer, hence this can 

serve as a reservoir of resistance genes within gut microbiota (Bailey et al., 2010; Carattoli 

2008). Especially, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and/or 

carbapenemase-producing E. coli is a major concern because it shows resistance against most 

of beta-lactam antimicrobial agents (Carattoli, 2008).

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates that the 

consumption of meat and milk in Africa will triple by 2050 (FAO, 2013); livestock 

production is an important agricultural sector in Africa. According to a surveillance data in 

2005, livestock production in Uganda contributed 493 million US dollars per year which 

accounted for about 5.56% of total Ugandan GDP. (FAO, 2005). The 2014 FAO census data 

estimates that in Uganda there are 4.9 million cattle, 2.0 million pigs, 3.9 million sheep and 

goats, and 60.0 million poultry. (FAO2017). With the shortage of veterinarians in food 

animals in Uganda becomes a big problem of livestock disease control. For instance, in 2002, 

the ratio of veterinarian to livestock was 1: 10,500 livestock units (LSU; based on the number 

of cattle, goats, sheep, pigs and chickens) while it was 1: 2,255 LSU in the USA (African 

Development Fund, 2002; FAO 2017, OIE 2016). Interestingly, farmers in Uganda can 

 

purchase antimicrobial agents without the prescription of a veterinarian and even go ahead to 

treat their livestock. This therefore, predisposes to the emergence ARB due to improper use 

of antimicrobial agents in livestock (Queenan et al., 2016).

In Uganda, several studies have detected and characterized ARB at a phenotypic level, 

for instance Afema et al. and Byarugaba et al detected antimicrobial-resistant E. coli, 

Salmonella, and Enterococcus spp. from livestock at a slaughterhouse (Afema et al., 2016; 

Byarugaba et al, 2011), Kateete et al. detected antimicrobial resistant coliforms from milk 

samples with mastitis (Kateete et al., 2013). However, these studies did not identify 

antimicrobial-resistant genes of their isolates. Here, we collected commensal E. coli from 

livestock feces derived from Ugandan farms to characterize antimicrobial susceptibilities and 

genotype of the isolates. In addition, we identified antimicrobial resistance genes contained in 

the feces by metagenomics analysis.

Materials and Methods 

Sampling and isolation of E. coli 

Fresh feces of livestock (cattle, pig, goat, and layer chicken) were collected at 

commercial farms (defined as farms that produce livestock products and/or live animals for 

market) and subsistence farms (that produce enough to feed themselves and their families) in 

Wakiso (n = 7) and Mpigi (n = 6) district in September 2016 and February 2017. Both 

districts are in the central region of Uganda, about 15 km (Wakiso) and 40 km (Mpigi) from 

Kampala, the capital of Uganda. When visiting the farms, we inquired from the farmers about 

(1) the type of livestock, (2) the number of livestock on the farm, and (3) the usage of 

antimicrobial agents. The bottles or pouch packs of antimicrobial agents were recorded when 

 

the farmers kept them. We also inquired health conditions of the livestock from the farmers 

and the district veterinary officers, and we collected feces from apparently healthy livestock 

only. A total of 130 fecal samples (n = 49 from Wakiso and n = 81 from Mpigi) were 

collected (Table 1). These samples were transported immediately to the Central Diagnostic 

Laboratory of the College of Veterinary Medicine, Animal resources and Biosecurity, 

Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda for further analysis.   

Feces were diluted in 0.85% sterilized saline, and 1 mL of fecal solution was inoculated 

on a Petrifilm SEC plate (3M Company, MN, USA). After overnight cultivation at 37°C, up 

to four blue colonies which were suspected to be E. coli by β-gluclonidase activity were sub 

cultured on ES Colimark agar media (Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) overnight at 

37°C. Single colonies with blue color were defined as E. coli isolates. In addition, these 

isolates were checked by E. coli-specific PCR (Wang et al., 1996).

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing 

To characterize antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli isolates, minimum inhibitory 

concentration (MIC) for 12 antimicrobial agents (ampicillin [AMP], cefazolin [CFZ], 

cefotaxime [CTX], gentamicin [GEN], kanamycin [KAN], tetracycline [TET], minocycline 

[MIN], nalidixic acid [NAL], ciprofloxacin [CIP], colistin [CST], chloramphenicol [CHL], 

and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim [SXT]) was tested by a broth micro-dilution method 

using frozen plates (Eiken Chemical) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. E. coli 

ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 were used as quality control strains 

for the MICs. Isolates with higher MIC for antimicrobial agents than the MIC breakpoint on 

the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline were defined as resistant, 

 

while breakpoint to CST was determined as ≥4 mg/L, according to the European Committee 

on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guideline (CLSI, 2016; EUCAST 2017). 

Isolates that showed resistance to at least one antimicrobial agent were used in further 

analyses. The correlation between the frequency of antimicrobial resistance and the use of 

respective antimicrobials on farms was analyzed by chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test 

using Microsoft Excel 2016 with Statcel v3 (OMS Ltd., Saitama, Japan) as an add-in for

statistical analysis.   

Phylogenetic typing 

PCR-based phylogenetic typing for E. coli was performed (Clermont et al., 2000). 

According to the PCR results, isolates were classified into seven groups and subgroups: A0, 

A1, B1, B22, B23, D1, and D2 (Escobar-Páramo et al., 2004).

Metagenomic analysis on shotgun DNA library 

Metagenomic analysis were performed to detect antimicrobial resistance genes 

contained in feces. DNA was isolated from six randomly chosen representative fecal samples 

 

from Wakiso (cattle 1, pig 3, and layer 2). The Feces were collected in a storage buffer 

(Hayaishi and Kawamoto, 2006) at room temperature. DNA was extracted from fecal bacteria

Antimicrobial resistance genes in E. coli strains 

PCR were performed to detect antimicrobial resistance genes as follows: for 

AMP-resistant strains, blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaOXA; TET-resistant strains, tetA, tetB, tetC, 

tetD, tetE, and tetG; for SXT-resistant strains, sul1 and sul2 (Colom et al., 2003; Phuong et 

al., 2008; Vignaroli et al., 2012).   

as described previously (Ushida et al., 2016). Briefly, fecal pellets were washed with 

phosphate-buffered saline and a portion of fecal pellets was transferred to tissue-lysis buffer 

(MDT buffer) in a DNA tissue kit of Mini-80 system (Kurabo, Osaka, Japan). Fecal pellet 

was disrupted with beads beating. After proteinase K treatment, bacterial DNA was purified 

using Mini-80 system. Resultant DNA solution was evaluated for its DNA concentration and 

purity by Nano-drop ND-1000 spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) and Qubit 2.0 (Invitrogen) 

with Qubit™ dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen). DNA was sent to BGI Japan, where 

shotgun library construction with KAPA HTP Library Preparation Kits (KAPA Biosystems) 

and paired-end sequencing was performed with the Illumina Hiseq X-Ten platform with the 

reagent Kit v2.5 (2 x 151 cycles). DNA sequence reads were assembled after elimination of 

low quality reads as previously (Tsuchida et al., 2017). Obtained fasta files were subjected to 

antimicrobial resistant gene search using DIAMOND v0.9.10 against the Comprehensive 

Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) database (Buchfink et al., 2015; McArthur et al.,

Results 

Usage of antimicrobial agents 

Our study sampled 13 farms: seven in Wakiso and six in Mpigi district. At each farm, 

we recorded the types of antimicrobial agents used (Table 1). In both districts, 53.8% (7/13) 

of farms used penicillins (mainly benzylpenicillin), 69.2% (9/13) used tetracyclines (mainly 

oxytetracycline), and 61.5% (8/13) used sulfonamides (with or without trimethoprim). 

Dihydrostreptomycin was the most frequently used aminoglycoside and often used in 

combination with benzylpenicillin. Macrolides and fluoroquinolones were not commonly 

used. Use of cephalosporins, carbapenems, old quinolones, colistin, and phenicols were not 

reported by the farmers. Penicillins (with or without aminoglycosides) were most commonly

used as an injection or spray for wound treatment for cattle and pigs. Tetracyclines were used 

as an injection for wounds or mastitis in cows and infection control and promotion of egg 

production in layers as feed or water additives. Sulfonamides (with or without trimethoprim) 

were used to treat diarrhea in cows and coccidiosis in chickens, diarrhea in cows and 

coccidiosis in chickens. Other drugs such as ivermectin, amprolium, albendazole, 

buparvaquone, and vitamins were used occasionally (data not shown).   

Sample collection and isolation 

After the isolation on ES Colimark agar media, 340 isolates were obtained. Among 

them, 293 isolates were positive for E. coli-specific PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibility test 

 

showed that 159 isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent. Twenty-five

isolates which were 1) derived from the same feces, 2) showed the same antimicrobial 

resistance pattern, and 3) identified as the same phylogenetic type were considered as 

duplicated strains and omitted from further analyses. Overall, 134 unique E. coli strains (54 

from Wakiso and 80 from Mpigi) were used for further analyses. Prevalence of each 

phylogenetic types among these 134 strains was as follows: A0, n = 13; A1, n = 56; B1, n = 

57; B22, n = 2; B23, n = 4; D1, n = 1 and D2, n = 1.   

Antimicrobial resistance phenotypes and genotypes 

Antimicrobial susceptibility tests revealed that TET-resistant isolates were very 

common in all livestock feces, with an overall prevalence of 97.0% (cattle 91.3%, pig 100%, 

goat 100%, layer 98.4%), followed by SXT resistance (56.7%) and AMP resistance (44.8%) 

(Table 2). A few isolates showed resistance to CFZ, KAN, MIN, NAL, CIP, CST, and CHL,

farms (odds ratio 2.03, 95% CI= 1.01 - 4.08, P =0.045 by chi-squared test) (Table 3).   

PCR for antimicrobial resistance genes revealed that 83.3% (50/60) of AMP-resistant 

strains harbored blaTEM as a beta-lactamase gene while blaSHV and blaOXA were not detected. 

Among TET-resistant strains (n = 130), 74.6% (97/130) harbored tetA gene, 9.2% (13/130) 

harbored tetB gene, 13.8% (18/130) harbored both tetA and tetB, and 0.8% (1/130) harbored 

tetC gene. Among SXT-resistant strains (n = 76), 11.8% (9/76) harbored sul1 gene, 57.9% 

(44/76) harbored sul2 gene, and 23.7% (18/76) harbored both sul1 and sul2.   

yet resistance to CTX and GEN were not detected. Isolates with co-resistance to 

AMP-TET-SXT were detected in all livestock, although the frequency was different (goat 

62.5%, cattle 47.8%, layers 33.3%, and pig 15.0%). In addition, four isolates from layers 

showed resistance to six antimicrobial agents tested, including five different antimicrobial 

categories; two of them were resistant to AMP-KAN-TET-NAL-CIP-SXT, one was to 

AMP-KAN-TET-NAL-CHL-SXT, and one was to AMP-TET-NAL-CIP-CHL-SXT.   

We analyzed the correlation between the frequency of resistance occurrence to 

penicillins (including AMP), tetracyclines, and sulfonamides in E. coli and the use of 

antimicrobial agents to livestock. The frequency of AMP-resistance in E. coli isolates from 

farms that used penicillins was significantly higher than that of E. coli from penicillin-free 

Metagenomic analysis 

The reads for each predicted antimicrobial-resistant gene by CARD are shown in 

Figure 1. We classified them into 16 categories, according to the mode of 

antimicrobial-resistance. Among them, genes for multidrug efflux pumps were most 

prevalent in all except in one sample. In #972-3, a pig sample from a subsistence farm,

tetracycline-resistance genes were the most frequently identified while the frequency of 

multidrug efflux pump gene was lower than other samples (Fig 1). The representative genes 

of each category identified by CARD are summarized on Table 4, and the actual read 

percentages are listed on supporting information (Table S1). In total, we identified 911 

antimicrobial-resistant genes. Multidrug efflux pump genes were the most frequent category 

(20.84% to 38.96% of total reads from each sample). Among them, mdtB, mdtC, and mdtF, 

genes which have been isolated from a plasmid in Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (Perreten 

et al., 2001), were the three most representatives (2.90-3.72%, 2.33-3.65%, and 0.82-3.59%, 

respectively). The second most prevalent gene category was old/new quinolone resistance 

genes (9.83%-13.45%), the third was tetracycline resistance genes (4.78%-35.81%), and the

Discussion 

fourth was polypeptides (including CST) resistance genes (5.58%-7.87%). Most resistant 

 

genes were encoded on bacterial chromosomal DNA such as blaACT for carbapenem 

resistance, mfd for quinolone resistance, and arnA for CST resistance. We also identified 

clinically important resistance genes which are often encoded on plasmidic DNA such as 

blaCTX-M for cephalosporin resistance, qnr for fluoroquinolone resistance, ermB for macrolide 

resistance, vanA and vanB for vancomycin resistance, and vatA for streptogramin resistance, 

while the frequencies of reads were not as high (Table S1). The heat mapping and principal 

component analysis using metagenomic read numbers showed that antimicrobial resistance 

genes identified from each sample were quite different (Figure S1).   

This study describes ARB in livestock in Uganda. There have been several reports on 

ARB in Ugandan livestock (Afema et al., 2016; Byarugaba et al, 2011); however, these 

studies were focused on cultivation of ARB only. Our study describes the use of

antimicrobials on farms and clarifies ARB in livestock, as well as the distribution of 

antimicrobial-resistance genes in ARB.   

In our study, inquiries to the farmers revealed that the usage of benzylpenicillin, 

oxytetracycline, and sulfonamides (with or without trimethoprim) was common on Ugandan 

livestock farms. Penicillins, with or without streptomycin, were often administered as an 

injection or spray to cattle and pigs, while oxytetracycline and sulfonamides were orally 

administered to layers through feeds or drinking water. In addition, antimicrobial 

susceptibility testing showed that resistance to AMP, TET, and SXT was common in the 

strains detected in our study among our strains, yet still co-resistance to these three 

antimicrobials was also detected. Previous studies on E. coli derived from Ugandan livestock 

 

have reported the same outcome (Afema et al., 2016; Byarugaba et al, 2011). Such 

characteristics were identical to the common antimicrobial agents which have been used at 

the sampling sites. These results support the theory that the use of antimicrobial agents 

contributes to the prevalence of ARB by providing selective pressure (Asai et al., 2005).

The dissemination of ESBL-producing E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae in 

livestock has been reported globally (Carattoli, 2008). A previous study on ARB isolated 

from clinical specimens of human hospital in Uganda showed high frequency of 

cephalosporin-resistant E. coli; 77.8% were resistant to ceftazidime (a third-generation 

cephalosporin) and 69.4% were resistance to cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) 

(Seni et al., 2013). In contrast, we didn’t detect CTX (a third-generation cephalosporin) 

resistant E. coli from livestock in our study. According to our data, no farms used 

third-generation cephalosporins or carbapenems for the livestock. Although we have no data 

on the availability of those antimicrobial agents in Wakiso and Mpigi districts, we speculate 

that cephalosporins and carbapenems are too expensive for the farmers to treat their livestock.

Consequently, we considered the absence of CTX-resistant E. coli in livestock resulted from 

the lack of exposure of CTX to the gut microbiota in Ugandan livestock. It is also possible 

that the difference in prevalence of cephalosporin resistance in E. coli suggests that the 

emergence and spread of cephalosporin-resistant E. coli in Uganda is not through zoonotic 

transmission but through medical use. However, the results of metagenomic analysis in our 

study also identified blaCTX-M-type ESBL genes and several carbapenem-resistance genes 

among fecal bacteria. Although we cultured E. coli only, this result indicates that blaCTX-M 

and carbapenem-resistance genes were not harbored by E. coli but harbored by other fecal 

bacteria, suggesting the possibility of horizontally transfer of those resistance genes from 

fecal bacterial population to E. coli. Previous studies suggested that the emergence of ARB is 

associated with the use of antimicrobial agents (Asai et al., 2005, Sato et al., 2014). 

 

Therefore, the emergence of cephalosporin and/or carbapenem resistant E. coli may occur if

these antimicrobial agents are used indiscriminately on Ugandan farms. As the dissemination 

of ESBL- or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae has become a global concern, the 

use of these antimicrobials and the presence of ARB in Uganda should be monitored 

carefully.   

We detected several E. coli strains that showed resistance to CHL and/or CST. 

However, phenicols (such as CHL and thiamphenicol) and CST were not used on the farms 

we visited. Although we did not investigate the availability of phenicols and CST in Wakiso 

and Mpigi districts, both antimicrobial agents are inexpensive compared with cephalosporins 

or carbapenems, and have been frequently used for livestock in other countries. In our study, 

antimicrobial use was self-reported by the farmers and determined by the researchers based 

on the drug bottles found at each farm. Therefore, there were some limitations that the results 

of interview may not be accurate representation of antimicrobial use on the farms. In 

addition, there is a possibility that CHL- and/or CST-resistant strains have been transmitted

from the farmers or livestock on farms in the surrounding area, which have used CHL and/or 

CST. Metagenomic analysis revealed that resistance genes for phenicols (CHL) and 

polypeptides (CST) were detected in the fecal samples. This suggest that, as same as blaCTX-M 

and carbapenemase genes, CHL- and CST-resistant genes were already spread in fecal 

bacterial population of Ugandan livestock.   

When comparing the result between animal species, multidrug-resistant strains that 

showed resistance to five different categories of antimicrobial agents were only identified 

from layers. Compared with other livestock, layers are frequently administered antimicrobial 

agents orally, as a food or water addictive, not only for the treatment of bacterial diseases but 

also as growth promoter (Brown et al., 2017). Consequently, the presence of 

 

multidrug-resistant E. coli in layers may be the result of the frequent or indiscriminate use of 

antimicrobial agents. These multidrug-resistant strains in layers are problematic for farmers 

because colibacillosis is one of major problem in layer production and causes huge economic 

losses (Bengtsson and Greko, 2014; Dziva and Stevens, 2008).

The results of the metagenomic analysis revealed that the frequency of ARB in the 

subsistent farm sample (#927-3) was different from other samples from commercial farms. In 

the sample, the frequency of multidrug efflux pump gene was lower than others. According to 

the owner of the subsistence farm, no antimicrobial agents were used at that time on the farm. 

We considered that the absence of antimicrobial use in the farm is the reason of low 

frequency of multidrug efflux pump gene in the sample. In contrast, the frequency of 

tetracycline resistance gene in the subsistent farm sample was much higher than others. 

According to the CARD analysis data, the main tetracycline-resistance gene in the 

subsistence farm sample is tetW (Table S1). In a previous study, the prevalence of tetW is 

reported to be clearly related to the usage of tetracycline (Tsuchida et al., 2017). The reason

why tetW gene was frequently detected from the subsistence farms sample is unclear. One 

possible explanation for this result is that the owner of the farm had used tetracycline before, 

and tetW gene had remained on the farm. A previous study reported that tet genes including 

tetW can remain without selection pressure (Tamminen et al., 2011). We need more 

surveillance to clarify the difference in the frequency of antimicrobial resistance genes 

between commercial farms and subsistence farms because the sample number of subsistence 

farm in this study was only one. 

Metagenomic analysis also detected antimicrobial-resistance genes for Gram-positive 

bacteria, such as macrolide resistance and vancomycin resistance genes (erm and van 

variants, respectively). This suggests that the presence of Gram-positive ARB was also

common in the fecal samples we studied. As a previous Ugandan study have reported the 

presence of antimicrobial-resistant enterococci (Byarugaba et al, 2011), further genetic study 

on Enterococcus spp. in Ugandan livestock is required.   

A limitation of this study is the criteria we used to determine duplicated E. coli strains. 

We determined duplicated strains by the origin, antimicrobial resistance phenotype, and 

phylogenetic type of the strains only. We excluded 25 duplicated isolates from analyses, but 

it might contain genetically distinct strains. Although we believe that the main phenotypic 

and genotypic features of antimicrobial resistance of E. coli in Ugandan livestock were 

clarified by our present data, other methods to check the duplication of strains such as 

repetitive element palindromic PCR or random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis should 

be performed.   

In conclusion, we identified ARB in Ugandan livestock using both the 

culture-dependent method (isolation of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli) and 

culture-independent method (metagenomic analysis on antimicrobial-resistant genes) for the

first time. Reports on ARB among animals in Africa is increasing, but there are still limited 

data available. Our results provide essential information on the prevalence of ARB in 

livestock in Uganda. Although we could not isolate third-generation cephalosporin-resistant 

E. coli, there is a risk of the emergence of cephalosporin- or carbapenem-resistant 

Enterobacteriaceae in Ugandan livestock because the genes for ESBLs and carbapenemases 

have already exist in their gut microbiota.
