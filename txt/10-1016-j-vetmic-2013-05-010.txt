Prevalence  and  antibiotic  resistance
Chad

This  study  aimed  at  updating  knowledge  on  the  prevalence  and  antimicrobial  resistance
characteristics  of  Salmonella  isolated  from  poultry  in  the  province  of  N’Djamena,  Chad.  The
results  collected  during  this  study  provide  the  ﬁrst  baseline  data  on  the  prevalence  of
contamination  by  Salmonella  in  laying  hens  and  broiler  chicken  farms  in  N’Djamena.  All
samples  were  collected  from  sixteen  poultry  farms  over  two  periods  of  six  months  each:
from  August  2010  to  January  2011  and  from  September  2011  to  February  2012.  Diagnostic
methods  used  during  this  study  allowed  to  isolate  eighty  four  Salmonella  strains,  belonging
to  twenty  seven  different  serotypes.  The  most  frequent  serotypes  were  Salmonella
Colindale  (19%)  followed  by  S.  Minnesota  (18%)  S.  Havana  and  S.  Riggil  (each  6%),  S.  Kottbus
and  S.  Amager  (4.7%),  S.  Idikan,  Mississipi,  and  Muenchen  (3.6%).  Other  serotypes  were
poorly  represented.  The  majority  of  these  serotypes  were  susceptible  to  all  antibiotics
tested  (CLSI  Standards),  except  some  S.  Colindale  isolates  that  exhibited  a  decreased
susceptibility  to  ﬂuoroquinolones,  S.  Limete  resistant  to  three  antibiotics  and  S.  Minnesota
isolates  resistant  to  ﬁve  different  antimicrobial  classes.  The  different  serotypes  and
antibiotic  resistance  proﬁles  that  were  observed  highlight  the  substantial  diversity  of
Salmonella  in  Chad,  the  contribution  of  avian  isolates  to  human  salmonellosis  and
Salmonella’s  capacity  to  colonize  all  types  of  environment  worldwide.

(Humphrey,  2006;  Dione  et  al.,  2011).  It  is  estimated  that
Salmonella  serotypes  cause  93.8  million  human  infections
and  155,000  deaths  annually  through  the  world  (Majowicz
et  al.,  2010).  Annually  in  the  US,  foodborne  salmonellosis  is
responsible  for  over  600  deaths  and  1.4  million  illnesses.
The  costs  for  medical  care  and  loss  of  productivity  can
range  anywhere  from  $464  million  to  $2.3  billion  (Galanis
et  al.,  2006;  Hendriksen  et  al.,  2011).  In  Europe,  the  number
of  human  cases  was  reported  to  be  greater  than  100,000  in
1997.  From  2007  to  2009,  the  total  of  Salmonella  outbreaks

294

D.  Tabo  et  al.  /  Veterinary  Microbiology  166  (2013)  293–298

decreased  by  23.6%,  from  2,253  outbreaks  in  2007  to  1722
outbreaks  in  2009  (EFSA,  2011).  In  France,  Salmonella
serovars  were  isolated  from  64%  of  foodborne  outbreaks
between  1996  and  2005  (O’Brien  and  De  Valk,  2003).

Salmonella  genus  contains  only  three  species,  namely:
Salmonella  enterica,  Salmonella  bongori  and  Salmonella
subterranean.  Salmonella  enterica  can  be  subdivided  into
at  least  six  subspecies  and  composed  of  more  than  2600
serovars.  Salmonella  bongori  has  no  subspecies  (Millemann
et  al.,  2010).  Although  several  serovars  belonging  to  the
genus  Salmonella  have  been  identiﬁed,  most  animal  and
human  salmonellosis  are  caused  by  only  a  few  non-
typhoidal  serovars  (O’Brien  and  de  Valk,  2003).  Some
serotypes  are  associated  with  speciﬁc  animal  reservoirs,
while  others  are  known  to  infect  a  wide  variety  of  animals
including  humans  (Jones  et  al.,  2008).

Most  studies  have  indicated  that  food  vectors  identiﬁed
as  the  main  source  of  non-typhoidal  salmonellosis  are
contaminated  poultry  meat  (chicken,  turkey,  etc.)  and  raw
or  under-cooked  eggs  and  derived  products.  World  Health
Organization  (WHO),  through  the  Salm-Surv  data  reported
that  from  2001  to  2005,  the  most  commonly  isolated
Salmonella  serotypes  worldwide  were  Enteritidis  (65%  of
isolates),  Typhimurium  (12%)  and  Newport  (4%)  (Hen-
driksen  et  al.,  2011).  According  to  Web-based  surveillance
and  global  Salmonella  distribution,  from  2000  to  2002,  S.
Enteritidis  and  S.  Typhimurium  represented  respectively
26%  and  25%  of  the  isolates  in  Africa  (Galanis  et  al.,  2006).
More  often  on  farms,  poultry  ﬂocks  can  be  infected  by
horizontal  transmission  through  infected  litter,  faeces,
feed,  water,  equipment,  diseased  chicks  and  rodents
contaminated  with  Salmonella.  They  can  also  be  infected
by  other  animals,  wild  birds  and  personnel  (Poppe,  2000).
In  the  two  last  decades,  antimicrobial  resistance  in
Salmonella  has  become  a  major  problem  in  public  health
worldwide  (Threlfall,  2002).  It  is  known  that  in  developing
countries  the  rise  of  antimicrobial  resistance  is  increas-
ingly  under  surveillance,  but  in  African  countries,  parti-
cularly  in  regions  of  Central  Africa,  these  problems  remain
very  complex.  This  is  because  in  these  countries  there  is
little  or  no  information  available  on  bacterial  resistance
(Vlieghe  et  al.,  2009).

In  Chad,  Central  Africa,  Salmonella  strains  and  other
major  zoonotic  bacterial  pathogens  are  not  often  isolated
and 
identiﬁed,  and  the  resistance  of  these  pathogens
including  Salmonella  to  commonly  used  antimicrobial  is
rarely  assessed  or  not  at  all  looked  for.  In  addition,  the  use  of
antibiotics  in  farms  is  not  subject  to  any  regulation.  This
study  represents  therefore,  the  ﬁrst  Chadian  investigation  to
gather  knowledge  on  Salmonella  infections  in  laying  hen  and
broiler  ﬂock  farms  in  N’Djamena.  The  aims  of  this  study  were
(1)  to  determine  the  prevalence  of  Salmonella  in  these  farms
and  (2)  to  update  knowledge  on  Salmonella  serotypes
diversity  and  their  antimicrobial  resistance  proﬁles.

2.  Materials  and  methods

2.1.  Study  and  survey  design

Our  study  was  carried  out  during  two  seasons,  from
August  2010  to  January  2011  and  from  September  2011  to

February  2012,  and 
involved  sixteen  out  of  the  30
functional  laying  hen  and  broiler  chicken  farms  identiﬁed
in  N’Djamena.  Farms  were  selected  on  the  basis  of  the  free
manager’s  choice  to  cooperate  or  not  during  our  study.  One
farm  was  visited  each  weak.  Each  farm  was  visited  only
once  and  the  manager  was  interviewed  with  the  ques-
tionnaire  at  right  time  of  sampling.  All  birds  in  each
sampled  farms  were  healthy.  At  the  farm,  information
about  structures  and  building  numbers,  production
capacity,  race,  age  and  origin  of  birds  were  collected.
The  Information  regarding  the  number  of  animals  in  the
ﬂocks,  control  of  rodents,  reptiles,  and  other  domestic
animals,  hygienic  and  bio-security  practices  and  the
number  of  workers  were  also  recorded.

2.2.  Sample  collection

Samples  were  collected  in  poultry  farms  each  week-
ends.  Because  of  limited  economic  means,  we  pooled
individual  samples  to  minimize  study  costs.  In  each  farm,
only  one  poultry  ﬂock  was  chosen  for  sampling.  Eight  pools
of  samples  per  farm  were  collected  as  follows:  3  pools  of
ﬁfteen  fresh  droppings  excreted  by  birds  on  litter,  3  pools
of  two  sterile  cloths  for  microbiological  control  of  litter
surfaces  (AES  Chemunex,  Combourg,  France),  1  pool
of  6    5  mL  of  water  from  watering  places  and  1  pool  of
6    5  g  of  food  from  feeders.  Each  pool  of  samples  was
collected  in  sterile  pouches  (AES  Chemunex,  Combourg,
France),  placed  in  a  cool  box  with  ice  packs  and  transported
to  the  laboratory  for  analysis.

2.3.  Salmonella  isolation  and  identiﬁcation

All  samples  (dropping,  sterile  Cloths,  food  and  water)
collected  were  analyzed  according  to  French  Norm  for
Salmonella  spp.  NF  ISO  6579/2002.

From  each  sample,  25  g  was  homogenized  in  225  mL  of
(AES  Chemunex,  Combourg,
incubated  at  37  8C  for  18–20  h  to  allow

buffered  peptone  water 
France)  and 
bacterial  reviviﬁcation.

respectively 

transferred 

One  millilitre  and  0.1  mL  of 

the  pre-enrichment
samples  were 
into  9  mL  of
Muller-Kauffmann  Tetrathionate-Novobiocine  broth  (AES
Chemunex,  Combourg,  France),  incubated  at  37  8C  for  18–
24  h  and  into  10  mL  of  Rappaport  Vassiliadis  Soja  broth
(AES  Chemunex,  Combourg,  France),  incubated  for  24  h  at
42  8C.  Afterwards,  the  enriched  samples  from  each  tube
were  sown  onto  Hektoen  and  XLD  agar  (AES  Chemunex,
Combourg,  France)  and  incubated  at  37  8C  for  24  h.

Presumptive  Salmonella  colonies  were  picked  and
grown  on  nutrient  agar  (AES  Chemunex,  Combourg,
France)  for  puriﬁcation,  and  conﬁrmed  by  biochemical
tests  using  the  Microgen  ID-GNA  gallery  for  enterobacteria
(AES  Chemunex,  Combourg,  France).  Potential  Salmonella
spp.  strains  were  serotyped  by  glass  slide  agglutination
using  Salmonella  polyvalent  O  and  H  antisera  (Bio-Rad,
Marne 
la  coquette,  France),  according  to  the  White-
Kauffmann-Le  Minor  Scheme  (Guibourdenche  et  al.,  2010).
To  decrease  in  cost  and  time,  some  Salmonella  strains
isolated  during  our  second  campaign  were  serotyped
according  to  the  Premi1 Test  Salmonella  (PTS)  method

D.  Tabo  et  al.  /  Veterinary  Microbiology  166  (2013)  293–298 

295

(Check-Points  BV,  Wageningen,  The  Netherlands).  The  PTS
principle  is  called  multiplex  ligation  detection  reaction  to
generate  a  collection  of  circular  DNA  molecules  that  are
subsequently  PCR  ampliﬁed  by  means  of  a  single  pair  of
amplimers.  The  PCR  products  are  then  sorted  by  hybridi-
zation  to  low  density  DNA  microarray.  Positive  hybridiza-
tion  is  detected  using  a  biotin  label  incorporated  into  one
of  the  PCR  primers  (Wattiau  et  al.,  2008).

2.4.  Antimicrobial  susceptibility  tests

Antimicrobial  susceptibility  was  tested  using  the  disc
diffusion  method  on  Mueller-Hinton  agar 
(Bio-Rad),
according  to  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards  Institute
recommendations  (CLSI,  2009).  The  16  antibiotics  tested
were  ampicillin  (10  mg),  amoxicillin  +  clavulanic  acid  (20,
10  mg),  cephalotin  (30  mg),  cefotaxime  (30  mg),  ceftazi-
dime  (30  mg),  sulphonamides  (300  mg),  cotrimoxazole
(1.25/23.75  mg), 
streptomycin
(10  mg),  kanamycin  (30  mg),  tetracycline  (30  mg),  chlor-
(50  mg),  nalidixic  acid
amphenicol 
(30  mg),  oﬂoxacin  (5  mg),  and  enroﬂoxacin  (5  mg).  Zone
diameters  were  read  by  the  automated  Osiris  scanner  (Bio-
Rad)  and  interpreted  with  CLSI  quidelines  (CLSI,  2011).
Escherichia  coli  ATCC  25922  was  used  as  quality  control.

3.  Results

3.1.  Prevalence  of  Salmonella  infection  in  laying  hens  and
broiler  chickens

The  16  farms  studied  corresponded  to  a  very  low
investment  and  were  modest  (average  capacity:  1000
subjects  per  band),  generally  with  one  or  two  buildings
(13/16  farms).  The  density  of  birds  ranged  between  6  and
13  subjects/m2 (10/14  farms)  and  the  ﬂoor  was  covered  by
a  litter  of  hacked  straws  of  doubtful  quality.  Drinking  water
sources  were  from  open  wells  or  boring  (12/16  farms).
Some  farms  studied  (10/16  farms)  had  a  fence  in  grilling,
but  in  poor  condition  with  free  access  to  stray  animals
(dogs,  cats,  ducks,  rodents,  reptiles..).  A  total  of  128  pooled
samples  collected  from  14  laying  hen  farms  and  2  broiler
chicken 
for  the
presence  of  Salmonella  and  of  these,  56  (43.75%)  pooled
samples  were  positive  for  Salmonella.  The  prevalence  rate
of  Salmonella  isolates  from  droppings,  sterile  Cloths,  feeds
and  water  are  shown  in  Table  1.

3.2.  Distribution  and  antimicrobial  susceptibility  of
Salmonella  serotypes

Out  of  a  total  of  84  Salmonella  isolates,  27  different
serotypes  were  identiﬁed.  The  most  frequent  serotypes
were  Salmonella  Colindale  (19%)  and  Salmonella  Minnne-
sota  (18%),  followed  by  S.  Havana  and  S.  Riggil  (each  6%),  S.
Kottbus  and  S.  Amager  (4,7%),  S.  Idikan,  Mississipi,  and
Muenchen  (3.6%).  Other  serotypes  were  poorly  repre-
sented.  The  overall  of  16  poultry  farms  tested  were  positive
for  Salmonella  and  the  farms  3,  9,  and  16  were  the  most
contaminated  (Table  2).

Among  the  84  Salmonella  isolates  tested  for  resistance
to  16  different  antimicrobials,  28  (33.3%)  isolates  belong-
ing  to  three  different  serotypes  were  resistant.  This
resistance  concerned  12 
isolates  of  S.  Colindale  that
exhibited  decreased  susceptibility  to  ﬂuoroquinolones,  1
S.  Limete  resistant  to  three  antimicrobials  and  15  S.
Minnesota  isolates  resistant  to  ﬁve  different  antimicrobial
classes  (Table  2).

4.  Discussion

4.1.  Prevalence  of  poultry  farm  contamination

Before  our  study,  there  was  no  recent  information
available  on  Salmonella  prevalence  on  Chadian  poultry
farms.  Indeed,  to  discuss  Salmonella  prevalence  in  the
N’Djamena  area,  it  is  necessary  to  look  back  to  the  1960s
and  ‘70s  to  gather  information  from  several  studies  by
Vigier  and  et  Chamoiseau  (1967);  Le  Minor  et  al.  (1969).
These  studies  have  widely  shown  the  diversity  and  the
dissemination  of  Salmonella  strains 
in  animal  species
during  this  time.

In  the  present  study,  10.7%  of  Salmonella  isolates  were
from  samples  collected  from  the  two  broiler  chicken  farms
with  50  day-old  ﬂocks.  This  result  is  not  representative  of
the  N’Djamena  broiler  chicken  population  because  of  the
small  number  of  samples  from  broiler  farms  and  should
not  be  interpreted  as  the  effective  prevalence  rate  of
Salmonella  infections  in  these  farms.  However,  it  allows  to
underline  the  question  of  sanitary  control  and  the  high
contamination  of  broiler  chicken  farms.

The  prevalence  rate  of  Salmonella  isolates  was  also
important  in  laying  hen  ﬂocks,  aged  from  2  to  23  months
according  to  farms  (Table  2).  This  study  showed  that
Salmonella  excretion  by  birds  occurs  at  all  ages  of  rearing

period.  This  is  certainly  because  of  stress  factors  such  as
the  onset  of  laying,  high  temperatures  and  the  end  of  the
production  period  (Humphrey,  2006).  We  found  that  the
prevalence  of  Salmonella  isolates  was  signiﬁcantly  higher
in  litter  samples  (35.7%)  than  in  other  pooled  samples
(faeces, 
feed  and  water).  The  relative  resistance  of
Salmonella  to  desiccation  (Davies  and  Wray,  1996)  might
justify  the  higher  probability  of  isolating  Salmonella  from
litter  samples  than 
food  and  water
samples,  where  the  competitive  ﬂora 
likely  to  be
important.  This  ﬁnding  may  be  explained  by  the  choice
of  the  bacteriological  and  sampling  methods  used  in  our
study,  which  were  very  sensitive  in  ﬂocks  during  our
investigations  for  isolating  Salmonella  serotypes  or  by  the
combination  of  bad  cleaning  and  disinfection  of  both

equipment  and  surfaces  such  as  ﬂoor,  walls  or  use  of
untrained  personnel.

According  to  Davies  and  Breslin  (2003),  the  high
contamination  encountered  in  caged  ﬂocks  was  not  due
to  a  higher  susceptibility  of  the  sampling  method  but  may
rather  be  linked  to  a  failure  to  properly  clean  and  disinfect
the  poultry  house  or  to  an  insufﬁcient  sanitary  control.  The
majority  of  the  infections  in  laying  hens  seem  to  be
attributed  to  the  persistent  contamination  of  the  farm.
Several  studies  suggested  that  measures  to  limit  vertical
and  horizontal  transmissions  include  ensuring  Salmonella-
free  feed  and  water,  effective  cleaning  and  disinfection  of
the  farm,  applying  appropriate  measures  against  animated
and  unanimated  vectors  (Humphrey,  2006;  Wales  et  al.,
2007).  These  ﬁndings  seem  to  corroborate  with  the  high

prevalence  rate  showed  by  our  study  and  are  in  agreement
with  the  general 
farms
involved  in  our  study  which  are  not  standardized  and
with  their  very  low  bio-security  measures  as  the  control
against  stray  animals,  rodents,  reptiles  and  amphibians
which  were  not  well  done.  This  suggests  in  term  that
sanitary  measures  at  the  ﬂock 
level  contribute  to  a
signiﬁcant  reduction  of  the  Salmonella  contamination  in
poultry  farms  of  N’Djamena.

4.2.  Distribution  of  Salmonella  serotypes

Salmonella  isolated  from  56  positive  samples  were  of  27
different  serotypes.  Among  the  84  Salmonella  isolated
during  our  study,  the  distribution  of  serotypes  is  very
heterogeneous  and  unique  because  of  their  large  diversity.
During  our  study,  the  most  frequent  serotypes  worldwide,
Salmonella  Enteritidis  and  Typhimurium  (EFSA,  2011),
were  poorly  isolated  (Table  2).

To  our  knowledge,  S.  Colindale,  the  most  prevalent
serotype  in  our  study,  was  ﬁrst  described  in  1955  from  a
woman  suffering  from  acute  diarrhoea  in  London  (Audrey
and  Holt,  1955).  Vigier  and  et  Chamoiseau 
(1967),
described  also  two  isolates  of  S.  Colindale  from  human
faeces  and  water  samples  in  N’Djamena.  In  a  recent  report
from  Gambia,  S.  Colindale 
is  described  as  the  most
common  (21.42%)  serotype  of  NTS  in  cases  of  enteric
infection  under  the  age  of  5  years  (Dione  et  al.,  2011).  We
believe  that  in  animal  infections,  particularly  in  poultry,
this  is  the  ﬁrst  description  of  this  serotype.  In  poultry  farms
sampled,  birds  were  asymptomatic  carriers. 
Indeed
Salmonella  can  persist  in  the  chicken  caecum  or  ovaries
without  triggering  clinical  signs  in  the  host.  The  asympto-
matic  Salmonella  carrier  state 
in  poultry  has  serious
consequences  for  food  safety  and  public  health  due  to
the  risk  of  food  poisoning  following  consumption  of
contaminated  products.

Salmonella  Minnesota  was  the  second  most  frequent
serotype  (18%)  in  our  study  and  isolated  from  3  laying  hen
farms.  S.  Idikan  was  described  in  the  past  by  Vigier  and  et
Chamoiseau  (1967),  from  eggs  of  hen  laid  without  shell
and  soiled  by  the  droppings.  Five  isolates  of  S.  Riggil  and  4
isolates  of  S.  Amager  were  isolated  from  2  different  farms.
They  were  isolated  in  the  past  by  Le  Minor  et  al.  (1969)
from  reptiles,  known  as  the 
important  reservoirs  of
Salmonella  species.  Our  study  revealed  3  isolates  of  S.
Muenchen 
in  2
different  farms.  This  old  serotype  has  been  implicated  in
outbreaks  associated  with  consumption  of  raw  alfalfa
sprouts  in  Madison,  USA  (Proctor  et  al.,  2001).  The  other
serotypes  were  variously  represented 
in  the  different
poultry  farms.

4.3.  Antimicrobial  resistance  of  the  Salmonella  isolates

Our  study  revealed  that  the  majority  of  Salmonella
serotypes  were  susceptible  to  all  antibiotics  tested,  except
some  S.  Colindale 
that  exhibited  decreased
susceptibility  to  ﬂuoroquinolones,  S.  Minnesota  isolates
resistant  to  ﬁve  different  antimicrobial  classes  and  S.

not  seem  to  harbour  any  speciﬁc  resistance  pattern  (Dione
et  al.,  2011).  Nevertheless,  one  isolate  was  described  as

attributed  to  MDR  genes  located  in  the  genetic  structure
named  SGI1  (Salmonella  Genomic  Island  1)  associated  with
antimicrobial  resistance  in  some  S.  Typhimurium  phage
types  and  gram  negative  organisms  (Mulvey  et  al.,  2006).
in  most  cases,

(i.e.  ampicillin)  or  a  ﬂuoroquinolone  (i.e.  ciproﬂoxacin)  or
sulphonamides  +  trimethoprim  (cotrimoxazole).  Even  if  in
this  study,  we  detected  very  few  resistances,  they  are  of
public  health  concern  as  they  affected  the  ﬁrst  line  empiric

5.  Conclusion

The 

results  of  our  study  provide 

representative
information  concerning  prevalence  rate  (43.75%)  and
resistance  on  Salmonella  contamination  in  broiler  and
laying  hen  farms  of  N’Djamena.  In  this  study,  we  revealed
that  the  sixteen  poultry  farms  tested  for  Salmonella  were
all  positive.  We  have  also  shown  the  great  diversity  among
the  Salmonella  serotypes  isolated  and  a  small  proportion  of
antimicrobial  resistant  isolates  during  our  present  study.
These  results  highlight  the  necessity  to  create  more
environmental  and  personnel  hygiene  awareness  among
Chadian  farmers,  because  many  managers  do  not  under-
stand  the  good  practice  of  sanitary  measures.  We  point  out
that  the  comparison  with  human  Salmonella  isolated  at  the
same  time,  based  on  some  molecular  methods  to  assess  the
possible  contribution  of  avian  Salmonella 
to  human
salmonellosis  is  under  way.
