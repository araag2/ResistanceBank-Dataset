Abstract 
Objective:  Multidrug resistance (MDR) and extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) producer Gram negative 
bacteria are considered as a major health problem, globally. ESBL enzyme hydrolyses the beta lactam ring of third 
generation cephalosporins, which alters the structure of the antibiotic. Due to the modification in structure of the 
antibiotic, bacteria show resistance to these antibiotics. Resistant bacterial strains are transmitted to humans from ani-
mals through consumption of uncooked meat, through contact with uncooked meat and meat surfaces. This study 
aims to assess bacteriological profile and analyze the situation of antibiotic resistance, multidrug resistance, and ESBL 
producing Gram negative bacteria in chicken meat.
Results:  A total of 38 chicken meat samples were studied in which 103 Gram negative bacteria were isolated. Spe-
cies of Gram negative bacteria were identified as Citrobacter spp. (44.7%), Salmonella spp. (26.2%), Proteus spp. (18.4%), 
Escherichia coli (4.8%), Shigella spp. (3.9%), Pseudomonas spp. (1.9%), and Klebsiella spp. (1.0%). The prevalence of MDR 
isolates was found to be 79.6%. Total ESBL producer was 36.9% and ESBL producer among MDR was 34.9%. This con-
cludes wide range of antibiotic resistance bacteria is prevalent in raw chicken meat.

Introduction
Multidrug resistance (MDR) is the ability of bacteria to 
resist different classes of antibiotics (three or more than 
three classes of antibiotics) which are structurally differ-
ent  and  have  different  molecular  targets  [1].  Antibiotic 
resistance is a result of antibiotic use. The greater the vol-
ume of antibiotics used, the greater will be the chances 
of  arising  antibiotic  resistance  population  of  bacteria 
[2].  There  is  growing  evidence  which  revealed  antibi-
otic resistance has been promoted by widespread use of 
non-therapeutic antibiotics in animals [3]. The misuse of

antibiotic can lead to the development of bacterial resist-
ance towards antibiotic, increases the burden of chronic 
disease, and increases costs of health services. Resistant 
bacteria are transmitted to human through direct contact 
with animal, by exposure to animal manure, through con-
sumption  of  uncooked  meat,  and  through  contact  with 
meat surfaces [4].

The  prevalence  of  MDR  isolates  and  ESBL  producing 
isolates is increasing in humans as well as animal. Fecal 
carriage  of  ESBL  gene  has  been  identified  as  the  major 
reservoir in the environment. Bacterial species that carry 
ESBL  genes  are  normal  inhabitants  of  gastrointestinal 
tract,  and  food  is  a  potential  source  of  them  [5].  Meat 
harbor  different  bacteria  as  an  inherent  contamination 
and are further contaminated during handling, improper

dressing, cleaning, insanitary condition, and unhygienic 
practices  of  selling  meat.  Consumption  of  these  unsafe 
meat arise public health hazards [6, 7]. This study aims to 
find the prevalence of MDR and ESBL producing isolates 
from chicken meat in Bharatpur metropolitan.

Main text
This cross-sectional study was conducted in Microbiol-
ogy Laboratory of Balkumari College, Tribhuvan Univer-
sity, Bharatpur, Nepal from 2016 December to 2017 June. 
Random sampling was done to collect non-repeated sin-
gle  meat  sample  from  different  slaughter  house  located 
in different places of Bharatpur, Nepal. Sample size was 
determined based on prevalence rate as reported by pre-
vious  study  [8].  A  total  of  38  samples  of  chicken  meat 
were included in this study.

Methodology
The  chicken  meat  samples  (15  g;  each  5  g  from  thighs, 
breasts, and wings of same chicken) prior to refrigeration 
were aseptically collected in a sterile beaker. The beaker 
was properly capped with aluminum foil and transported 
quickly  to  the  laboratory.  Samples  were  transferred  to 
conical  flask  containing  peptone  water  and  incubated 
for 30 min at 80 rpm at room temperature in a rotator 
(Thermo  Scientific  Compact  Digital  Mini  Rotator;  Cat. 
No.  8880025).  After  incubation,  1  ml  of  contaminated 
peptone water (HiMedia, M028) was further transferred 
to  two  different  test  tubes  containing  nutrient  broth 
(HiMedia,  MM244)  and  Selenite  F  broth  (Himedia, 
M025S). Test tubes were incubated aerobically at 37 °C 
overnight. After incubation, samples from nutrient broth 
were  streaked  in  m-endo  agar  (HiMedia,  M1106)  and 
MacConkey agar plates (HiMedia, M081). Samples from 
Selenite  F  broth  were  streaked  to  Salmonella-Shigella 
agar  plates  (HiMedia,  M108).  All  the  plates  were  incu-
bated aerobically at 37 °C for 24 h. Gram negative isolates 
were  identified  by  following  standard  microbiological 
techniques which include studies of colony morphology, 
staining reactions and various biochemical properties [9]. 
Pure isolates were identified by performing the standard 
biochemical tests (SIM test, MRVP test, citrate test, ure-
ase test) [8].

Antibiotic susceptibility test of isolates was performed 
following  modified  Kirby-bauer  disk  diffusion  method 
as  recommended  by  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards 
Institute  (CLSI)  [10].  The  antibiotics  used  in  this  study 
were nitrofurantoin (NIT), ampicillin (Amp), cefotaxime 
(CTX),  ceftazidime  (CAZ),  gentamicin  (Gen),  cipro-
floxacin  (Cip),  colisitin  (Cl),  doxycycline  hydrochloride 
(DO),  imipenam  (Imp)  and  polymyxin  B  (Pb).  Screen-
ing of ESBL was performed by using ceftazidime (30 µg) 
and  cefotaxime  (30  µg)  disks.  The  zone  of  inhibition 

(ZOI)  ≤  22  mm  for  ceftazidime  and  27  mm  for  cefo-
taxime  was  considered  as  potential  ESBL  producer  as 
recommended  by  CLSI.  For  the  conformation  of  ESBL, 
combination disk method was used. The combination of 
ceftazidime  and  cefotaxime  alone  and  in  combination 
with clavulanic acid (CA) (10 µg) were used. An increase 
ZOI of ≥ 5 mm for either antimicrobial agent tested in 
combination with CA versus its zone when tested alone 
confirms ESBL positive. All the antibiotic discs used in 
this study were purchased from Himedia, India. For bio-
chemical tests and antibiotics susceptibility tests, follow-
ing reference strains were used as quality control strains: 
E  coli  ATCC  25922;  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  ATCC 
27853;  Klebsiella  pneumonia  ATCC  700603;  Proteus 
mirabilis  ATCC  35659;  and  Salmonella  typhimurium 
ATCC 14028.

All  data  were  entered  in  Microsoft  Excel  and  Chi 
square  test  was  performed.  P  value  was  calculated  and 
considered significant only when it was less than 0.05.

Results
Based  on  sanitation  parameters  (hygienic  condition  of 
slaughter house, chopping boards, and showcased meat, 
and cleanliness of slaughter personnel), we have catego-
rized meat samples as good sanitation and poor sanita-
tion type. Out of 38 collected samples, 14 samples were 
grouped into good sanitation type and 24 samples were 
grouped  into  poor  sanitation  type  (Additional  file  1: 
Table S1). A total of 103 Gram negative bacterial strains 
were  isolated  among  which  only  one  sample  showed 
growth  with  single  isolate  and  remaining  all  samples 
showed growth with multiple isolates. Out of 103 bacte-
rial isolates, 27 (26.2%) and 76 (73.8%) bacterial isolates 
were obtained from good sanitation and poor sanitation 
type meat samples, respectively (Additional file 1: Table 
S2). Among 103 Gram negative isolates, the number of 
Citrobacter spp., Salmonella spp., Proteus spp., Escheri-
chia coli, Klebsiella spp., Shigella spp. and Pseudomonas 
spp. were 46 (44.7%), 26 (26.2%), 19 (18.4%), 5 (4.8%), 1 
(1.0%), 4 (3.9%) and 2 (1.9%), respectively (Fig. 1).

Among 103 Gram negative isolates, 36 (34.9%) of bac-
teria were MDR producing extended spectrum beta lac-
tamase,  in  which  13  (12.6%)  strains  of  Salmonella  spp. 
account  to  be  highest  MDR  ESBL  producer  (Table  1). 
From both good sanitation and poor sanitation type meat 
samples, 82 (79.6%) isolates were detected as multidrug 
resistance. Among MDR isolates, Salmonella spp. (85.2%) 
and  Pseudomonas  spp.  (100.0%)  showed  high  prevalent 
of  MDR.  The  frequency  of  ESBL  producer  bacteria  in 
meat samples was found to be 38 (36.9%). Pseudomonas 
spp.  (100.0%),  E.  coli  spp.  (40.0%),  and  Salmonella  spp. 
(55.2%) showed high prevalent of ESBL producer bacte-
ria (Table 2). Statistical analysis showed that there was no

ples (P > 0.05).

The antibiotic resistance pattern of the Citrobacter spp. 
showed highest 32.6% isolates were resistant to the imi-
penam followed by cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin (19.5%, 
each). All the strains of Salmonella spp. were resistant to 
ampicillin (100%) followed by nitofurantoin (84.6%) and 
doxycycline hydrochloride (84.0%). Proteus spp. revealed 
29.4%  resistivity  to  imipenam  followed  by  ciprofloxacin 

(11.7%) (Additional file 1: Table S3). The antibiotic resis-
tivity pattern of E. coli showed all the isolates were resist-
ant  to  ampicilin  followed  by  colistin  and  polymyxin  B 
(80%, each), whereas resistivity were not detected to dox-
ycycline hydrochloride, gentamicin and imipenam.

Discussion
Animals and its products are potent source of MDR bac-
teria. Consumption of unhealthy meat, unhygienic live-
stock  practices  and  polluted  environment  surrounding 
slaughter  house  contribute  for  transmission  of  several 
diseases and antibiotic resistant bacterial strains [4, 11]. 
In Nepal, information regarding prevalence of MDR and 
ESBL producer Gram negative bacteria in chicken meat 
is poorly available. Therefore, this study was conducted 
to assess prevalence of MDR and ESBL producer Gram 
negative bacteria in chicken meat.

This study observed that Citrobacter spp., Salmonella 
spp.,  Proteus  spp.,  E.  coli,  Klebsiella  spp.,  Shigella  spp. 
and  Pseudomonas  spp.  were  the  major  Gram  negative 
bacteria  among  103  bacterial  isolates  (Fig.  1).  Most  of 
these  isolates  are  considered  as  pathogenic  which  sug-
gest chicken meat is an important source of food borne 
infection. Similar pattern of Gram negative bacteria were 
found in several other studies conducted in North East 
India, China, South Korea, Vietnam, and Spain [11–15].

Citrobacter species are frequently found in water, soil, 
food,  and  the  intestines  of  animals  and  humans.  Most 
human cases of Citrobacter infection are caused by Cit-
robacter  freundii  and  Citrobacter  koseri  [16,  17].  The 
prevalence of MDR and ESBL producing Citrobacter spp. 
was  found  to  be  78.3%  and  26.1%,  respectively.  These 
magnitudes are comparable with the study conducted by 
Kanamori et al. which reported 19.3% of Citrobacter spp. 
was ESBL producer [18]. Citrobacter spp. is a low viru-
lence bacterium and thus can persist in host population

for long periods. Over time, they accumulate resistance 
determinants  which  may  transform  to  more  virulent 
organisms [17].

The prevalence of Salmonella spp. was 26.2% which is 
similar to the studies carried out in USA and South Korea 
[13,  19].  In  contrast,  higher  prevalence  rate  of  Salmo-
nella spp. was found in Southern Thailand (67.5%) [20] 
and  China  (54.0%)  [12].  Prevalence  of  Salmonella  spp. 
in chicken meat indicates that contamination may occur 
during  slaughtering  process  or  evisceration.  Salmonella 
spp.  in  chicken  meat  can  be  considered  as  important 
cause  of  food  borne  Salmonellosis  [13,  21].  Salmonella 
spp. isolates from this study were resistant to ampicillin 
(100.0%), nitrofurantion (84.6%) and doxycycline hydro-
chloride  (84.0%).  Similar  broad  resistant  pattern  were 
observed in previous studies [22, 23]. This study showed 
the prevalence of MDR and ESBL producing Salmonella 
spp. was 85.2% and 55.2%, respectively. In a study con-
ducted  in  South  Korea  found  87.2%  of  Salmonella  spp. 
were  MDR  isolates  [13].  In  Thailand,  84.4%  isolates  of 
Salmonella  spp.  were  multidrug  resistant  which  were 
isolated from chicken meat [19]. The prevalence of ESBL 
producing  Salmonella  spp.  was  very  high  compared  to 
study performed by Wu et al. [24], which reported only 
8.6% prevalence of ESBL producing Salmonella species. 
Attention should be given to control the presence of high 
rate of ESBL-producing Salmonella in food.

In overall, we found high prevalence (79.6%) of MDR 
bacteria  in  chicken  meat.  It  is  well  documented  that 
Gram negative bacilli harbor series of antibiotic resistant 
genes  which  can  be  transferred  to  other  bacteria  hori-
zontally  [31].  All  Gram  negative  bacilli  isolated  in  this 
study namely E. coli, Salmonella spp. have been shown to 
cause different nosocomial infection [32]. This indicates 
that the emergence of MDR strains from chicken meat is 
potent threat. In this study, the prevalence of ESBL pro-
ducer bacteria in chicken meat is 36.9% and ESBL pro-
ducer among MDR was 34.9%. ESBL production by the 

Prevalence of E. coli MDR and ESBL producer strains 
were 80.0% and 40%, respectively. Similar resistivity pat-
tern was observed in Vietnam [14], China [25], Portugal 
[26],  and  Spain  [15].  In  addition,  several  studies  have 
reported  an  increased  ESBL  cases  from  E.  coli  strains 
isolated from animals and pets [15, 26, 27]. Escherichia 
coli  are  common  inhabitants  of  the  human  and  animal 
guts  and  are  indicators  of  fecal  contamination  in  food. 
However, they have also emerged as important causes of 
nosocomial and community-acquired infections [28].

The  MDR  pattern  of  Proteus  spp.  showed  14  (73.7%) 
isolates  were  multidrug  resistance.  Among  all  Proteus 
spp., 5 (26.3%) isolates were ESBL producer. Numerous 
studies  have  reported  presence  of  MDR  strains  Proteus 
species from animal sources [29, 30].

bacteria  might  be  higher  due  to  excessive  use  of  broad 
spectrum  antibiotics.  The  ESBL  enzymes  are  mutant, 
plasmid-mediated  beta  lactamases  derived  from  older, 
broad  spectrum  beta  lactamase  (e.g.  TEM-1,  TEM-2, 
SHV-1). Thus, they mediate resistance to extended spec-
trum  (third  generation)  Cephalosporins  (e.g.,  Ceftazi-
dime, Cefotaxime, Ceftriaxone) [33].

Conclusions
This  study  showed  high  prevalence  of  MDR  and  ESBL 
producer  Gram  negative  bacterial  strains  in  chicken 
meat. The frequency of Gram negative bacteria as MDR 
and ESBL producer is elevating globally. Antibiotic resist-
ance is a worldwide problem and its transmission from 
animal source to human is increasing tremendously. Both 
MDR  and  ESBL  incidence  are  considered  as  extreme 
public health issue. The problem of the bacterial resist-
ance  to  antimicrobial  drugs  is  more  troublesome  to 
developing countries like Nepal where facilities for health 
care, surveillance for antibiotics medication and facilities 
to detect MDR and ESBL are poorly developed.

Limitations
Gram positive bacteria, yeast, and fungi were not consid-
ered in this study. We were unable to assess the quality of 
water used for washing purpose, and sanitation condition 
of the site where birds were undressed and eviscerated. 
Future studies should consider these factors in address-
ing the MDR and ESBL prevalence.
