Objective: To reveal
the presence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(S. aureus) (MRSA) in poultry samples and to determine the antibiogram pattern against
Ô¨Åve antibiotics.
Methods: Samples from different poultry farm of Chittagong city, Bangladesh were
examined for S. aureus by different biochemical tests and conÔ¨Årmed as MRSA by
identifying the presence of mecA gene using PCR. Antibiotic resistance pattern in
S. aureus was determined by antibiotic disk diffusion method.
Results: In this study, a total of 60 samples (30 from nasal swabs and 30 from cloacal
swabs) were used, of which 54 were conÔ¨Årmed as S. aureus by different biochemical
tests. Among these, 12 were conÔ¨Årmed as MRSA by detecting mecA gene using PCR.
During antibiogram study, both nasal and cloacal samples showed the highest resistance
against penicillin-G and the lowest resistance was observed against neomycin.
Conclusions: Based on the present study, it can be said that different antibiotics are used
extensively in poultry that leads to MRSA and is alarming for human health.

1. Introduction

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is an opportunistic path-
ogen in human and other different animal species. The pathogen
is mainly related to food poisoning and is the third largest cause of
food related illness throughout the world [1‚Äì3]. S. aureus can
cause a number of
infectious diseases such as dermatitis,
pneumonia, meningitis, osteomyelitis in human, bovine mastitis
in cattle and bumble foot disease in poultry [4]. Methicillin
resistance in this bacterial species is very alarming for human
health, as it has shown potential for zoonotic transmission [5].
In Germany, zoonotic transmission of methicillin-resistant
S. aureus (MRSA) from livestock to humans occurs mostly

positive in 26 persons who worked in Dutch poultry
slaughterhouses out of 466 tested persons. This indicates a
higher risk of exposure of MRSA compared to general Dutch
people [7].

named

as

the

genetic

element

MRSA was Ô¨Årst reported in 1961 [8]. MRSA is mediated by
penicillin binding protein PBP2a, which is a 78 KDa protein. This
protein is often heterogeneously expressed in staphylococci [9‚Äì11].
It shows low afÔ¨Ånity for b-lactum antibiotics. The mecA gene is
responsible for encoding this protein [10] and found on a large
mobile
staphylococcal
chromosomal cassette mec (SCCmec) [12,13]. Until now at least 8
SCCmec types (SCCmec I to SCCmec VIII) have been identiÔ¨Åed
[12‚Äì14]. MRSA has been reported in a variety of meats including
raw chicken, turkey, pork, veal, beef, mutton or lamb and rabbit
[15‚Äì18]. Prevalence of MRSA was the highest in turkey (35.3%),
followed by chicken (16.0%), veal (15.2%), pork (10.7%) and
beef (10.6%) [19]. During a prevalence study of MRSA in food
and food products of poultry in Germany, MRSA was found in
37.2% samples [20]. In Spain, 318 raw food samples were
examined and identiÔ¨Åed only Ô¨Åve MRSA isolates [21]. Similar
result was found in a study in the USA, only 1.8% was MRSA

positive out of 114 tested samples [22]. Detection of MRSA has also
been reported in some countries in different proportions, for
example, Netherlands 2.5%, Canada 6.4%, Italy 3.8%, and Spain
1.6% [23]. In Asia, few reports are available on livestock-
associated MRSA, which is probably due to shortage of very few
data and diagnostic facilities. The prevalence of nasal MRSA
colonisation among pig farmers varied from 5.5% in Malaysia to
15% in China and 19.2% in Taiwan [24].

Extensive use of antimicrobial drug in human and in animal
farming for therapeutic and preventive purpose, is a major cause
for the prevalence of drug resistance among food born patho-
gens [25]. Different antimicrobial agents such as penicillin,
erythromycin, tetracycline are extensively used in poultry for
treating staphylococcal and other infections, which leads to
development of drug resistant strains of pathogens [26‚Äì28].

The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of
mecA gene in S. aureus collected from nasal swab and cloacal
swab of poultry sample as well as to determine the frequency of
resistance and sensitivity to Ô¨Åve antimicrobial agents in these
samples. Poultry sector is a signiÔ¨Åcant source of economic
development in Bangladesh. Extensive use of different antibi-
otics leads to development of MRSA in our poultry, which is a
global problem as well. This study will help to determine the
presence of MRSA in poultry to ensure quality meat as well as to
prevent losses in poultry industry due to infection of S. aureus.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sample collection area

The samples were collected from different poultry farms
located in urban and peri-urban areas of Chittagong city,
Bangladesh. Nasal and cloacal swabs were used as samples from
broiler chicken of these farms.

2.4. Electrophoresis of PCR product

The PCR amplicons were separated on 1% agarose gel in
1 √ó TAE buffer. Four microlitres of PCR product and 3 mL of 1 kb
ladder (RBC Bioscience, Taiwan) was loaded on gel well. After
that, the gels were documented under a UV transilluminator.

2.5. Antibiogram study of S. aureus

Antibiogram proÔ¨Åle was determined by disc diffusion assay.
Five antibiotics erythromycin (15 mg), gentamycin (10 mg),
neomycin (30 mg), penicillin-G (10 mg) and tetracycline (30 mg)
(Micro Master, India) were used for this experiment. Isolates
from each sample were Ô¨Årst incubated in Luria‚ÄìBertani broth for
overnight, which was then spread on Mueller‚ÄìHinton agar
(HIMEDIA, India) plate. The antibiotic discs were then placed
on the Petri plate and incubated for 16‚Äì24 h at 37
C. Results
were collected in mm by measuring clear zone around each
antibiotic.

3.1. Strain conÔ¨Årmation

A total of 60 samples (30 nasal swabs and 30 cloacal swabs)
were inoculated in mannitol salt agar. Results from Gram
staining, catalase and coagulase test showed that 100% nasal
samples and 86.67% (26 out of 30) cloacal samples were
Staphylococcus sp. positive.

2.2. Isolation and identiÔ¨Åcation of S. aureus by
phenotypic observation

During collection of samples, buffered peptone water (HIME-
DIA, India) and mannitol salt agar (HIMEDIA, India) were
used as bacterial culture media. S. aureus was identiÔ¨Åed by Gram
staining, slide coagulase and catalase test.

A total of 56 samples (30 from nasal swabs and 26 from
cloacal swabs) were subjected to PCR for detection of the
presence of mecA gene. Out of these samples, 12 samples of
S. aureus showed the presence of mecA gene (Figure 1), which
means that these bacteria were MRSA.

From 30 nasal swabs, 7 samples of S. aureus showed positive
result for MRSA, and the percentage was 23.33%. The percentage

4. Discussion

To appraise the potential health hazard, it is important to
detect the occurrence of MRSA in poultry samples. In the pre-
sent study mecA gene PCR assay was used to identify MRSA
positive samples. Out of 56 samples, 12 showed positive result
in PCR. Thus the prevalence of MRSA was 21.43% in the total
tested samples, which comprises 23.33% for nasal swabs and
19.23% for cloacal swabs separately. The percentage of anti-
microbial resistance is increasing over time and consequently
higher percentage of antibiotic resistance was found in recent
poultry sample than in old sample [28]. Recurrent use of different
antibiotic agents in poultry industry could be the cause of
elevation in MRSA percentage.

Usage of different antimicrobial agents such as penicillin,
erythromycin, and tetracycline is very common for the treatment
of staphylococcal infection [27,29]. Recently the percentage of
MRSA is increasing in an alarming rate. In the Netherlands,
the percentage of MRSA was 16% in chicken meat while in
Korea it was 13% [19,30]. In our study, we found 93.33%
resistance against penicillin-G for
the samples from nasal
swabs, which was the highest among all Ô¨Åve antibiotics. For the

cloacal swabs, the percentage was 96.15% for the same antibiotic.
Moreover, multidrug resistant S. aureus in poultry meat have
been reported in the USA [31]. During the antibiogram study,
92.9% resistance was reported against tetracycline in poultry
meat [32]. We also found a high percentage of resistance against
tetracycline that comprised 83.33% and 80.76% for nasal
swabs and cloacal swabs, respectively. In our study,
least
resistance was shown for gentamycin and neomycin compared
to the other three antibiotics. Similar result was also found for
other poultry isolates, 14.8% and 17.3% resistance against
gentamycin and neomycin, respectively [28].

In poultry, penicillin,

tetracycline and erythromycin are
extensively used antimicrobial agents for
the treatment of
staphylococcal infections [27,29]. In the present investigation, we
found more resistance against
these antibiotics compared to
gentamycin and neomycin.

In conclusion, the Ô¨Åndings of the study dictate that both the
prevalence and frequency of MRSA in poultry are alarming and
increasing day by day with the increasing trends of usage of
antibiotics. This study was based in Chittagong only. Similar
studies can be extended to other areas of Bangladesh to deter-
mine the horizontal intensity of prevalence and frequency of
MRSA. Further studies may also be done to determine the speed
and alacrity of zoonotic transmission of MRSA that may help in
assessing the risks posed by MRSA to human health.
