Abstract

Aim: The study was carried out to investigate the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical pathogens isolated 
from Bovine Mastitis in and around Coimbatore District, Tamilnadu, South India. 
Materials and Methods: A total of 250 milk samples were screened and 152 isolates of Staphylococci were obtained and 
their susceptibility to several antimicrobial agents by agar disc diffusion method. 
Results: Out of 152 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus resistance was detected in 63 (41.44%), 39 (25.65%), 21(13.81%), 18 
(11.84%),  6  (3.94%)  and  5  (3.28%)  isolates  for  penicillin,  streptomycin,  erythromycin,  tetracycline,  ampicillin  and 
Cephalothin, respectively. No resistance was detected for Gentamicin. 
Conclusion: Results indicated that these isolates exhibited the highest degree of resistance to penicillin of all antimicrobial 
agents tested.  
Key words: Antimicrobial agents, Bovine Mastitis, Disc diffusion, Mastitis pathogens

Introduction

Mastitis in bovines has become extremely complex 
and the costliest disease in India. It affects 50% of the 
herd population. It has been estimated that the mastitis 
alone can cause approximately 70% of all avoidable 
losses incurred during milk production [1]. 
It is incriminated 
as an important disease constraint in dairy cow and is 
responsible for reduction in quality and quantity of 
milk and milk products mainly due to microorganisms 
[2]
.  Over  135  different microorganisms  have  been 
isolated from bovine intramammary infections(IMI), but 
the majority of infections are caused by staphylococci,
streptococci,  and  gram-negative  bacteria 
.  As  a 
remedy  antimicrobials  are  used  very  frequently  for 
infectious diseases on dairy farms, but the therapeutic 
outcome of S. aureus causing disease is poor, in part 
due to the versatile ability of the pathogen. Therefore, 
selection of a more effective drug for mastitis therapy by 
the evaluation of antimicrobial resistance may become 
a reality to clinical veterinarians 

mastitis  pathogens  are  frequently  used  by  bovine 
practitioners  to  guide  cow  or  herd  level  treatment 
decisions. However, for certain antimicrobial agents, 
previous  studies  failed  to  demonstrate  statistically 
significant  associations  between  the  results  of 
susceptibility testing and the treatment outcomes for 
clinical  and/or  subclinical  mastitis 
.  Increased 
resistance of staphylococcal isolates recovered from 
mastitic domestic ruminants to different antimicrobial 
[7]
agents  has  been  reported  by  several  authors 
. 
Antibiotics are routinely administered at drying-off to 
treat sub clinical cases of mastitis and prevent further 
infection 
. Although fairly successful, this practice 
may  lead  to  the  development  of  antibiotic  resistant 
strains,  as  reported  for  S.aureus 
.  Antibiotic 
treatment of mastitis leads to significant increase in 
milk quantity and quality, lower somatic cell count and 
is  likely  associated  with  reduction  in  prevalence  of 
clinical mastitis among herds, which is economically 
beneficial 
. Bacterial identification and susceptibility 
tests  are  important  for  selecting  the  appropriate 
antimicrobial agent when treating mastitis 
. The 
purpose  of  this  study  was  to  determine the  in  vitro

for S.aureus (11.84%) were similar to those from Iran

Sensitivity to penicillin predicts susceptibility to 
other β-lactam antimicrobial agents, e.g. ampicilline. 
In this study 152 (41.44%) isolates of S.aureus were 
penicillin resistant. These results are similar to those 
reported  from  cows  with  mastitis  in  United  States 
(44%) [19], Argentina (40%) [20] and Iran (57%) [18] 
but higher than reported for S.aureus strains isolated 
from bovine mastitic milk in Germany (17%) [3]. The 
detection of β-lactamase production in staphylococci 
is  a  useful  and  rapid  method  to  detect  penicillin 
resistance.  At  the  National  Veterinary  Institute, 
Uppsala, β-lactamase results are used as rapid screen 
to indicate penicillin resistance [17]. For streptomycin 
our findings showed resistance to S.aureus (25.65%), 
similar to the results reported by Saad Gooraninejad et 
al. [18] for S.aureus in Iran (30.62%). The S.aureus 
was not gentamicin resistant. This result is similar to 
the  results  obtained  for  S.aureus  in  Iran  (Saad
