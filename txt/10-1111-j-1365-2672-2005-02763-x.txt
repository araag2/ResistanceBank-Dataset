Abstract

Aims: The main objectives of this study were to investigate the diversity of
Campylobacter genotypes circulating in Senegal and to determine the frequency
of antibiotic resistance.
isolated from poultry
Methods and Results: Strains of Campylobacter jejuni
(n = 99) and from patients (n = 10) and Campylobacter coli
isolated from
poultry (n = 72) were subtyped by pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The
pulsotypes obtained after digestion by SmaI and KpnI revealed a signiﬁcant
genetic diversity in both species, but without any predominant pulsotypes.
However, farm-speciﬁc clones were identiﬁed in the majority of poultry houses
(76Æ5%). Human and poultry isolates of C. jejuni had common PFGE patterns.
High quinolone-resistance rates were observed for C. jejuni (43Æ4%) and C. coli
(48Æ6%) isolates obtained from poultry.
Conclusions: The results showed a genetic diversity of Campylobacter between
farms indicating multiple sources of infection; but speciﬁc clones had the abil-
ity to colonize the broiler farms. The antimicrobial resistance patterns were not
related to any speciﬁc PFGE pattern suggesting that resistance was due to the
selective pressure of antibiotic usage. Campylobacter with similar genotypes
were circulating in both human and poultry.
Signiﬁcance and Impact of the Study: This study is important for the under-
standing of the epidemiology of Campylobacter in broiler farms in Senegal. It
also emphasizes the need for a more stringent policy in the use of antimicro-
bial agents in food animals.

Introduction

Thermophilic Campylobacter spp. (especially Campylobac-
ter jejuni and Campylobacter coli) is among the most
important agents of human gastrointestinal infections in
the developed world (Altekruse et al. 1999; Van de Giessen
et al. 1998). Campylobacter enteritis is an also emerging
public-health problem in developing countries (Gedlu and
Aseffa 1996; Simango and Nyahanana 1997; Prasad et al.

2001) and is particularly serious for immuno-compromised
individuals (Obi and Bessong 2002).

Contaminated food is a common source of human
illness and consumption or handling of poultry is consid-
ered to be a major route of infection, at least in develo-
ped countries (Stern et al. 2001). In Senegal, C. jejuni and
C. coli have been recovered from commercial poultry pro-
duced under the conditions described below (Cardinale
et al. 2004). However,

infections remains unknown, as does the signiﬁcance of
chicken meat as a vehicle of infection, since no epidemio-
logical analysis has been made previously in that country.
The Senegalese chicken industry was established only
recently. The birds are reared in open-sided houses with
no artiﬁcial ventilation and the material used for litter is
usually wood shavings (sometimes chopped straw or
shredded paper). The basic foodstuffs for the birds are
imported maize and locally produced peanut cake and
ﬁsh meal. Typically, each ﬂock is vaccinated against New-
castle disease and Gumboro disease and medicated to
protect it from coccidiosis. Most day-old chicks come
from hatching eggs that are imported from Europe or
Brazil. The birds are normally slaughtered at 40 days of
age and eviscerated manually without chilling. The resul-
tant carcasses are sold in retail shops, of which there dif-
ferent kinds in Dakar. Some have no shelter and are
exposed to direct sunlight; the food display area and sales
counter are table-like structures made from wooden
boards; the meat itself is not refrigerated. Other shops are
well-established commercial outlets, with an electrical
supply, water available and refrigeration equipment. Such
shops are purpose-built and have employees who handle
and sell the food.

In attempting to trace sources of infection and routes
transmission, use has been made of phenotypic
of
methods,
such as biotyping and serotyping (Garcia
et al. 1985; Nielsen et al. 1997). In practice, these meth-
ods have only limited discriminatory power and var-

Most cases of human enteritis from Campylobacter do
not require antimicrobial treatment, being brief, clinic-
ally mild- and self-limiting. However, complications,
such as septicaemia, may occur and require treatment.
Macrolides and ﬂuoroquinolones are the most useful
antimicrobial drugs for treating Campylobacter infections,
but
increasing resistance has been reported (Piddock
1995; Saenz et al. 2000; Engberg et al. 2001). In Senegal,
it was found that 34% of Campylobacter isolates from
poultry were resistant
to ciproﬂoxacin (Ci)(Cardinale
et al. 2003).

The objectives of the present study were to (i) investi-
gate the diversity of genotypes occurring on poultry farms
and in broiler chicken meat in Dakar, and to compare
these to clinical isolates collected from the same area and
(ii) evaluate the frequency of antibiotic resistance in poul-
try isolates and determine whether resistance is associated
with speciﬁc genotypes.

Materials and methods

Bacterial isolates

The poultry isolates of C.
jejuni and C. coli originated
from farms and retail shops and were collected between
January 2000 and December 2003 in the Dakar (capital
city) region. Forty broiler farms were chosen at ran-
dom. These farms belonged to the modern poultry sec-
tor and all showed similar characteristics. At each farm,
ﬁve broilers were slaughtered and breast-skin samples
(each weighing c. 25 g) were taken. Farm managers
were asked to complete a questionnaire about any
drugs used during the life-span of the ﬂock. In addi-
tion, 10 randomly selected retail shops were investigated
and skin samples taken from ﬁve chicken carcasses in
each case. The samples were analysed as described by
Cardinale et al. (2004). Brieﬂy, each sample was added
to 225 ml of Preston broth containing Preston antibi-
otic supplement (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) and incuba-
ted at 42 °C for 24 h under microaerobic conditions
(Campygen: Oxoid). The sample was
then streaked
onto Virion plates (Mueller-Hinton agar: Merck, Ger-
many; Bacto agar: Difco, Detroit, MI, USA; with 5%
deﬁbrinated horse blood: AES Laboratoire, Combourg,
France) and onto Karmali plates (Oxoid). Plates were
incubated at 42 °C under microaerobic conditions for
48 h. Isolates were identiﬁed using a commercial identi-
ﬁcation method (API CampyÒ, bioMe´rieux, France)
and multiplex PCR (Denis et al. 2001).

Ten human isolates, obtained from epidemiologically
unrelated domestic patients during 2001 and 2002, were
provided by the Pasteur Institute of Dakar. These origin-
ated from faecal samples, cultured on plates of Campylo-
bacter blood-free selective medium and identiﬁed as
described previously.

PFGE analysis

Prior to the extraction of DNA, each isolate was cultiva-
ted at 42 °C overnight on Karmali agar (AES Laboratoire)
under microaerobic conditions.

Results

Campylobacter spp. were isolated from 68Æ4% of the poul-
try samples. The contamination rate was similar at both
types of test location (69% at the farms vs 66% at the
retail shops). Four farms and four retail shops harboured
both C. jejuni and C. coli. The species distribution was
jejuni 57Æ9% and C. coli 42Æ1%. Only ten human
C.
isolates were examined; all belonged to C. jejuni.

PFGE analyses

Campylobacter jejuni
Macrorestriction with SmaI and KpnI yielded 24 different
patterns consisting of seven to 10 fragments and 25 pat-
terns of 9–19 fragments, respectively (Fig. 1). Twenty-ﬁve
pulsed-ﬁeld proﬁles were obtained with both enzymes
(Table 1). None of these patterns indicated a predomin-
ant genotype. Most of the human isolates (40%) were
grouped in pattern SJ6KJ6. The dendrogram (Fig. 1)
showed several clusters but only one was signiﬁcant (18
isolates).

Discussion

To study the epidemiology of Campylobacter infections,
several genetic typing methods have been developed in
order to differentiate isolates below species level (Wasse-
naar and Newell 2000). However, PFGE has been widely
recognized as the most discriminatory method for both
C.jejuni (Fitzgerald et al. 2001a) and C.coli (Fitzgerald
et al. 2001b). It has also been demonstrated that macro-
restriction analysis with the two enzymes, SmaI and KpnI,
was the method of choice for subtyping (On et al. 1998;
Michaud et al. 2001).

In the present study, 68Æ4% of chicken carcasses were
contaminated with Campylobacter. These results are con-
sistent with those of a previous study, where Campylobac-

ter was isolated from 63% of broiler ﬂocks (Cardinale
et al. 2004). The ﬁndings are also in accordance with the
results obtained from other developing countries, such as
Kenya and China, where thermophilic Campylobacter spp.
have been isolated from 77 and 76% of chicken samples,
respectively (Osano and Arimi 1999; Shih 2000).

In this study, we identiﬁed a signiﬁcant diversity of
PFGE patterns among strains from different farms, but
with speciﬁc clones occurring in most of the farms. Some
ﬂocks may be infected by two or more different strains;
however, the method used did not allow multiple strains
on any one chicken carcass to be detected. Moreover,
strains that were present in lower numbers and grow less
well in enrichment media or are more sensitive to oxida-
tive stress and damage are likely to be overlooked (Peter-
sen and Wedderkopp 2001).

The presence of one predominant strain at a particular
farm has already been demonstrated in several studies
(Berndtson et al. 1996;
In fact,
studies on the dynamics of infection in experimentally
infected chicken ﬂocks have concluded that some strains
of Campylobacter are able to become dominant, while

preventing colonization by other strains (Korolik et al.
1998; Barrow and Page 2000). In Senegalese poultry pro-
duction, numerous sources of infection exist and a previ-
ous study has highlighted several possible risk factors
(Cardinale et al. 2004). Poultry ﬂocks appear to become
infected mainly by horizontal pathways via the farm envi-
ronment. This is consistent with earlier reports showing
that the main source of infection is likely to be the imme-
diate surroundings of the house, in spite of the use of

hygiene barriers (Kazwala et al. 1990; Van de Giessen
et al. 1998).

By contrast, the samples from retails shops harboured a
variety of strains. In Senegal, retail outlets are small shops
that sell only a relatively low number of chickens and are
supplied by numerous farms. Thus, each shop is a site of
possible cross-contamination from chickens of multiple
origins.

SJ20KJ23 or SJ23KJ7. Because of
the low number of
human isolates, it is difﬁcult to draw ﬁrm conclusions
about the potential for transmission from broiler chickens
to humans, as is the case in other countries (Hanninen
et al. 2000; Petersen et al. 2001). In Senegal, many enter-
itis sufferers do not seek medical attention and, even
among those that do, only some will have a stool speci-
men cultured for enteric pathogens. This is especially true
for Campylobacter, because there is no systematic investi-
gation of Campylobacter cases in medical
laboratories.
Further investigation of human isolates is badly needed.

In our survey, high rates of resistance to quinolones
were observed for both species of Campylobacter isolated
from chicken samples. This was similar to the results

obtained in several European countries (Piddock 1995)
and in Japan (Chuma et al. 2001). As reported by Saenz
et al. (2000), cross-resistance between Na and Ci has also
been observed in Spain. Since 1991, when Endtz et al.
(1990) identiﬁed the ﬁrst quinolone-resistant C.jejuni and
C. coli in the Netherlands, the resistance of Campylobacter
to quinolones has increased throughout the world (Saenz
et al. 2000; Engberg et al. 2001). It has long been sugges-
ted that this resistance was related to the introduction of
the antibiotics into veterinary medicine (Endtz et al. 1990;
Saenz et al. 2000). In Senegal, ﬂuoroquinolones (norﬂoxa-
cin, enroﬂoxacin) were ﬁrst used in poultry production in
1996 to treat respiratory and intestinal diseases, such as
colibacillosis and salmonellosis. Due to treatment failures
with other antibiotics, they became the ﬁrst-line drugs in
2000. Thus, according to our observations, the high pre-
valence of quinolone-resistance could be related to the
introduction of these drugs in the industry (McDermott
et al. 2002). Moreover, there was no relationship between
antimicrobial resistance and PFGE patterns. This suggests
the absence of any dominant clones that might have devel-
oped resistance in the past and then ﬂourished under
selective pressure. Instead,
the observed resistance was
probably generated de novo by genetic modiﬁcation from
the selective pressure of antibiotic usage. Most of our
highly quinolone-resistant strains exhibited the Threon-
ine86-Isoleucine substitution, but we also found a Thr-86-
Ala substitution in four isolates and no mutation in four
others. The Thr-86-Ala change was described previously
by Bachoual et al. (2001) for one clinical strain of C.jejuni
)1), but
with high-level resistance to Na (MIC 64 lg ml
)1). Piddock et al.
low-level resistance to Ci (MIC 2 lg ml
(2003) also found a lack of mutation in gyrA in two resist-
)1, respect-
ant isolates (MICs for Ci of 16 and 32 mg l
ively), and they suggested that development of resistance
in the absence of a mutation in gyrA is extremely rare.
However, we believe that other mutational changes might
exist in gyrA outside the critical region. It has been shown
that factors other than gyrA QRDR mutations, such as
efﬂux pumps and parC, may contribute to the resistance
phenotype (Gibreel et al. 1998; Lin et al. 2002).

At present, Senegal is one of the biggest producers of
poultry meat
in West Africa (http://faostat.fao.org/).
While there still is a traditional sector, a modern system
of poultry production has been developed over the last
15 years. At the same time, Campylobacter has emerged as
a potential hazard to consumers, not only in relation to
food poisoning, but also through the spread of antibiotic
resistance. Although further investigations are needed to
explore the relationship between human and poultry
isolates,
this study has highlighted the importance of
continuous, routine surveillance to monitor the Campylo-
bacter situation in Senegal.
