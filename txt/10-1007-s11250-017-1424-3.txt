Abstract A cross-sectional study was conducted between
January and July 2014 in Unguja island of Zanzibar to estab-
lish prevalence of subclinical mastitis (SCM) in smallholder
dairy cows and patterns of antibacterial susceptibility of major
mastitis pathogens isolated. A total of 416 dairy cows from
201 farmers were randomly selected from three districts of
Unguja Island to participate in the study. Questionnaire inter-
view, field observation, individual cow examination,
California Mastitis Test (CMT) and bacteriological examina-
tion were carried out. Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion technique
was used to test drug sensitivity for common bacteria isolated.
Based on CMT results, the overall prevalence of SCM was
28.6, 48.8 and 64.7% at quarter, cow and farm level, respec-
tively. Prevalence of bacterial infection was recorded at 42.9,
70.9 and 78.6% at quarter, cow and farm examined, respec-
tively. The common bacteria isolated included Staphylococcus
aureus (36.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.8%),
Staphylococcus epidermidis (16.1%), Klebsiella spp. (9.5%),
Micrococcus spp. (6.3%) and Escherichia coli (4.9%). In con-
clusion, findings of this study demonstrated high level of sub-
clinical mastitis at farms, cows and quarters levels with both
contagious and environmental bacterial pathogen involved.

Introduction

Bovine mastitis is the most important disease in dairy industry
around the world (Girma et al. 2012) which can be classified
into contagious and environmental forms (Bradley 2002).
Contagious mastitis is caused by pathogens which can cause
infection and can be transmitted between animals.
Environmental mastitis is caused by opportunistic pathogens
living within cow’s environment that can invade udder
through teat orifices when proper milking techniques are not
observed. Based on the clinical manifestation of affected
cows, mastitis could also be classified as either clinical mas-
titis (CM) or subclinical mastitis (SCM) (Radostits et al.
2000). Clinical mastitis is characterised by physical changes
such as swelling, hotness, pain and indurations of the udder or
chemical changes which include discolouration, presence of
clots in the milk of infected quarter which can be easily ob-
served by farmer. In contrary, SCM cannot be physically ob-
served but can be detected by increased Somatic Cell Counts
(SCC) to more than 200,000 cells/ml or by isolation of mi-
crobes that caused the disease.

Economic losses from CM include reduced milk produc-
tion, increased treatment costs, milk discarded and culling of
chronic cases. These can be observed easily by the farmer
compared to SCM. In SCM a farmer cannot realise the eco-
nomic loss, which is relatively higher due to the prolonged
decrease of milk produced from individual cow, together with

the decreased quality of produced milk as a result of increased
number of both somatic cell count and pathogens (Halasa
et al. 2009). The public health risk associated with bovine
mastitis cannot be under estimated where antibiotics are used,
especially when the withdrawal period is not observed. In
addition, a wide range of pathogens can be harmful to human
when raw milk is consumed (Jones 2009).

Occurrence of both types of CM and SCM has been previ-
ously demonstrated in different studies conducted in other
parts of Tanzania (Swai et al. 2006; Karimuribo et al. 2006)
with high prevalence of SCM compared to CM. In those stud-
ies, different species of mastitis pathogens were isolated and
various risk factors associated with the occurrence of both CM
and SCM were identified. Quarter level prevalence of SCM
was previously described by Suleiman et al. (2013) in Pemba
island showing a high prevalence of 34.4 and 35.7% as de-
fined by CMT and bacteria isolation respectively.

Most of the time, treatment of mastitis begins before know-
ing the causative agent involved or without proper antibiotic
testing. This may lead to the use of antibiotics which are not
effective or the use of antibiotics in cases where bacteria are
not involved as causative agents. Improper use of antibiotics
may increase the percentage of resistance among bacteria in
both animal and human populations (Padol et al. 2015).
Although antibiotic resistance in bovine mastitis pathogens
has been reported elsewhere (Awandkar et al. 2013), similar
work has never been conducted in Zanzibar. The current
cross-sectional study was therefore designed to (a) investigate
the occurrence of SCM in Unguja Island, (b) identify impor-
tant risk factors associated with SCM, (c) isolate common
bacterial mastitis pathogen and establish their antimicrobial
susceptibility profiles.

Material and methods

Study area and sample size

The Unguja Island lies between latitudes 05° 72″ and 06° 48″
South of Equator and longitude 39° 30″ and 39° 51″ East of
Greenwich about 45 km from the east cost of Tanzania
Mainland. The island has a tropical climate with temperature
ranging from 24 to 32 °C, experiencing two rainy seasons in
March to May and September to November and two dry
seasons of November to March and May to September. This
study used the formula derived from Bennett et al. (1991) to
estimate disease proportion using cluster sampling as shown.

previous study which was 0.67 according to Suleiman
et al. (2013); e2 is precision which is equal to absolute
estimated error at 5% (0.05); b is number of lactating
dairy cows to be sampled from each household (2); z is
a confidence level at 95% (1.96); D = design effect
which can be calculated using the following formula
D = 1 + (b-) roh = 1.2; roh is a rate of homogeneity
which was estimated at 0.2. A total of 201 dairy farmers
were selected to participate in the study.

Sampling technique and sample frame

A multi-stage sampling procedure was adopted to select par-
ticipating dairy farmers. Initially, purposive sampling of three
out of six districts of Unguja Island based on the population of
dairy cattle in the districts was made. The selected districts
included North B, West and Central. In the second stage, a
total of 28 Shehias (lowest administrative level of local gov-
ernment authority in Zanzibar) were randomly selected from a
list of 59 Shehias with dairy farming activities. In the third
stage, a total of 201 dairy farming households were randomly
selected from an established sampling frame of all dairy
farmers in the selected Shehia using a simple random selection
procedure. For the dairy farmer to be included in the sample
frame, the only criterion was the possession of at least one
lactating dairy cow. Finally, each household was considered
as a cluster and all lactating dairy cows were included where
416 lactating dairy cows were selected.

Data collection procedure

Each participating household was interviewed by using a sim-
ple structured questionnaire. The aim of this interview was to
collect information about the farmers’ awareness, knowledge
and practices, and compare them with the outcome variable of
occurrence of SCM in dairy cows. Field observation was used
to assess environmental condition, management procedure
and individual cow assessment in terms of hygiene and phys-
ical soundness in relation to the occurrence of mastitis where
general condition of cow, udder and individual teats were
assessed for observable clinical signs of mastitis. Several farm
and cow risk factors were collected during the field visit,
among them were use of calf for milk let-down during milking
(yes, no), hygienic condition of the drainage system (dirty,
clean), use of towels to dry the teats before milking (yes,
no), characteristic of dairy farmers to wash hands before
milking (yes, no), number of animals in the farm, lactating
stage of each sampled cow, amount of milk produced in litres,
number of milkings per day (twice, once), number of parturi-
tion, water availability for cleaning (yes, no), milking tech-
nique used if teat stripped or hand fist. All the observed risk
factors were compared with the occurrence of SCM based on
CMT or bacteriology results.

Cow side and laboratory test

California Mastitis Test (CMT) was used to screen lactat-
ing cows for SCM. In this test one or two strips of milk
(about 2 mls) from each teat was milked directly into the
CMT pad after discarding the first two strips. Each milk
sample in the CMT pad was mixed with equal amount of
CMT reagent and the result recorded according to the
standard procedure (Varatanovic et al. 2010) depending
on the reaction formed. Quarter milk samples from both
CMT positive and negative quarters were aseptically col-
lected directly from each teat into a 20-ml sterile and
unique labelled universal bottle according to the procedure
described by Quinn et al. (1994). The samples were stored
in a cool box containing ice pack with a temperature of
4 °C and transported to the Maruhubi Veterinary
Investigation Centre for bacteria isolation and identifica-
tion. In the laboratory, the samples were cultured on the
same day or deep frozen at − 20 °C waiting for culture
within 72 h. Each sample was cultured in duplicate using
MacConkey and blood agar, one set incubated aerobically
and another an-aerobically. Bacterial growth was observed
after 24 and 48 h where if no growth observed, the quarter
was considered negative. For positive growth, colony
morphology, pigmentation and haemolytic reaction were
observed. Gram stain was used to distinguish between
gram positive and negative bacteria and to study the mi-
croscopical features of the isolated bacteria. Different bio-
chemical tests as described by Vashist et al. 2013a were
used to identify genus and species of isolated bacteria.
Modified oxidase test was used to differentiate between
gram positive cocci bacteria, those with positive results
were identified as Micrococcus spp. while those with neg-
ative results were subjected to catalase and coagulase
tests, isolates with positive results in both tests were iden-
tified as S. aureus. Isolates that tested positive to catalase
and negative to coagulase were subjected to oxidase test
and those with negative results were confirmed to be
S. epidermidis (non-haemolytic) or S. haemolyticus
(haemolytic). Rod shape gram positive bacteria were ex-
posed to catalase and oxidase tests, negative results for
both tests confirmed the presence of Trueperella pyogenes
while isolates that were positive to catalase and urease
were identified as Corynebacterium spp. Based on culture
characteristics on MacConkey agar, Gram negative bacte-
ria were categorised into lactose fermenters with pink col-
onies and non-lactose fermenters (colourless colonies).
Lactose fermenters were subjected to catalase, urease, in-
dole tests and citrate fermentation, isolates with positive
results for catalase and indole with negative results for
urease and citrate fermentation were identified as E. coli
and those with citrate fermentation, catalase and urease
positive and indole negative were identified as Klebsiella

spp. Non-lactose fermenters were subjected to catalase and
oxidase tests, isolates with positive results to both tests
were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, isolates with
catalase positive and oxidase negative were identified as
Proteus spp.

Testing for antibiotic sensitivity

A total of eight antibiotics belonging to four groups were used
to assess susceptibility profiles of major mastitis bacteria iso-
lated. The antibiotic selection was based on their availability
in the local market and those commonly used to treat mastitis
in Zanzibar. Susceptibility was tested using Kirby-Bauer disc
diffusion technique as described by Vashistet al. 2013b. A
portion of pure colony of bacteria isolated was transferred in
a tube with 5 ml of nutrient broth and incubated at 37 °C for
24 h. The mixture was then transferred into a Muller Hinton
agar plate and spread using sterile glass tube. The antibiotic
discs were then placed on the plate using sterile forceps and
incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The antibiotic discs used, their
concentration and used breakpoints are shown in Table 1.

Data processing and analysis

Data storage and analysis was done using Epinfo® version
7 for window where descriptive statistic and logistic regres-
sion analysis was performed. Graphic presentation was pre-
pared in Microsoft Excel 2007. The outcome variable in
this study was the prevalence of SCM as defined by CMT
or bacteria culture at farm, cow and quarter levels. A cow’s
quarter was considered positive for CMT if the score was
positive one and above while a cow was regarded positive
if at least one quarter was CMT positive, where as a farm
was considered positive if at least one cow in that farm was
CMT positive. Based on culture results, a quarter was con-
sidered culture positive if bacteria were isolated from the
sample collected while a cow was considered culture pos-
itive if bacteria were isolated from at least one quarter, and
a farm was positive if at least one cow from that farm was
positive. Tests for significance of proportions as defined by
SCM prevalence in different categorical variables were per-
formed using chi square (x2) test. Simple regression analy-
sis was used to screen categorical and explanatory variables
that significantly influenced the occurrence of SCM as de-
fined by CMT and Bacteria isolation. Variables that scored
P value equal to or less than 0.2 during simple regression
(14 and 19 risk factors as defined for CMT and bacteria
isolation respectively) were forwarded to multiple regres-
sion analysis and only variable with P value ≤ 0.05 were
included in the final model of risk factors that influenced
the prevalence of SCM.

Results

Screening for mastitis

Most farmers (62.6%) were aware about clinical mastitis and
its clinical manifestation, 39.4% of the interviewed farmers
reported having at least one clinical case of bovine mastitis
in their farm for the period of 1 year before the study but none
of the farmers had knowledge about subclinical mastitis. A
total number of 1664 quarters were physically screened for
CM and related lesions, out of which 16 (1%) were blind,
14 (0.8%) were injured and 1634 (98.2%) were normal.
Milk samples from 1648 quarters were subjected to CMT
screening and laboratory culture. No milk samples were ob-
tained from blind teats.

Prevalence of subclinical mastitis based on CMT
and bacteria isolation

The quarter level prevalence of SCM as defined by CMT and
bacteria isolation showed an overall prevalence of 28.6 and
42.9% for CMT and bacteria isolation respectively. There was
no statistical difference in the prevalence among quarters
based on their position (P > 0.05). Quarter level prevalence
for both CMT and bacteria isolation were significantly higher
in the Central district compared to the West and North B
districts (P < 0.05) as shown in Table 2. SCM prevalence at
cow and farm level in each study district is shown in Table 2
with an overall prevalence of 48.8 and 64.7% for CMT and
70.9 and 78.6% for bacteria isolation at cow and farm level,
respectively. During this study, bacteria were isolated from
75.6% out of 472 milk samples that tested positive to CMT
and 28.8% out of 1176 milk samples that tested negative for
CMT. The results described that it was more likely to isolate
bacteria from CMT positive compared to CMT negative

(OR = 7.3, 95% CI = 5.7–9.4). Although 50% of injured teats
were CMT positive compared to 28.5% normal teats and bac-
teria were isolated from 57.1% of injured teats compared to
42.8% of normal quarters but the difference was not signifi-
cant in both scenarios (P = 0.07 and 0.27) for CMT and bac-
teria isolation respectively.

Bacteria isolated

Out of 1648 sample cultured, 35.4% yielded a single bacteria
species, 7.5% produced two bacteria species, 1.1% samples
yielded more than two bacteria species which were considered
as contaminants and were not included in the final positive
results. A total of 19 species of bacteria were isolated, the
majority of which were aerobic as shown in Fig. 1.
Antibiotic susceptibility patterns of each of the common bac-
teria isolated in this study are shown in Table 3.

Potential risk factors associated with SCM

As shown in Table 4, the final model of categorical and con-
tinuous variables associated with the occurrence of SCM as
defined by CMT at quarter level included water availability,
use of calf for milk let-down, lactation stage and herd size.
Based on bacteria isolation, the risk factors included drainage,
milking per day, milking technique, uses of towel, hand wash
before milking, number of parity and milk produced.

Discussion

The prevalence of SCM as described by both methods of
CMT and bacteria culture at farm, cow and quarter levels were
high. The high prevalence of SCM within East African region
were also described in previous studies conducted before

(Abrahmsen et al. 2014; Nkoroi and Maitho 2014). SCM
prevalence was significantly higher in the Central district
compared to the West and North B districts (Table 2). Poor
sanitary measures in the Central district as demonstrated be-
fore (Suleiman et al., 2016) could explain such higher preva-
lence. Findings of this study indicated that it is more likely to
isolate bacteria from CMT positive cases of bovine subclinical
mastitis compared to CMT negative (OR = 7.3). CMT positive
results without bacteria isolation observed may be due to the
presence of other microorganisms rather than bacteria that
trigger cow immunological response and hence increased
number of somatic cell counts in the milk samples, pathogens
like fungi, algae, mycoplasma, mycobacteria etc. that require
special culturing media and methods. This may also be ex-
plained by the occurrence of infections of short term nature
that were already cleared during samples collection depending
on cow immunological status as observed before (Abdel-Rady
and Sayed 2009). While CMT negative samples that
harboured bacteria may be explained by the presence of bac-
teria that do not trigger the immunological response of the
infected quarter resulting in a limited increase in the somatic

cells count (Gitau et al. 2014). This is what can be identified as
intra-mammary infection (IMI) where bacteria were isolated
without somatic cell count change of the infected quarter
(Mdegela et al. 2009). Likewise, contaminants occurring in
the milk samples despite hygienic precautions may lead to
false positive detections. Teat injuries increased the risk of
quarters to be infected with SCM for about two and half folds
(RR = 2.49). Presence of wounds near the teat orifice may be
accompanied with the presence of opportunistic bacteria near-
by that may invade the teat canal during or immediately after
milking. This was also described by Madut et al. 2009.

The predominant bacteria species isolated from this study
was Staphylococcus aureus with making about36.8% of the
bacteria isolated; similar results were also reported by other
researchers (Ondiek et al. 2013; Elbably et al. 2013). The
majority of bacteria species isolated in this study were also
described in other studies conducted in Tanzania or other East
African countries. Very few samples (0.1%) harboured
Clostridium spp. as a potential cause of SCM. Involvement
of Clostridium spp. was also mentioned in other part of Africa
(Osman et al. 2009; Odongo et al. 2012). In contrast to what

R resistance, S sensitive, percentage of isolate with intermediate results is not shown in this table

has been demonstrated in other studies (Mdegela et al. 2009;
Nkoroi and Maitho 2014), this study could not manage to
demonstrate the involvement of Streptococcus spp. in the oc-
currence of SCM.

During this study, more risk factors were significant when
defining SCM by bacteria culture compared to CMT screen-
ing. The SCM prevalence was higher in barns with dirty drain-
age system (OR = 1.21) because both, environmental and
contagious bacteria have favourable conditions to hide
waiting to invade the uninfected udder (Abunna et al. 2013).
Water availability plays a vital role in the cleaning of barn,
milking area, cow udder and hands before milking and hence
the prevalence of SCM decreased with water availability
(P = 0.007). Proper cleaning of hand before milking have
positive effects on reducing the prevalence of SCM
(OR = 0.56), the quantity of opportunistic bacteria which

may invade the udder when proper milking hygiene is not
practiced (Shittu et al. 2012). Although all farmers participat-
ed in the study use hand milking but the way they milk their
cows have significant effect on the increased prevalence of
SCM (OR = 0.63). The prevalence seems to be lower in farms
used stripped method of milking compared to those who used
hand fist. Use of calves for milk let-down was found to have
positive impact in reducing the prevalence of SCM, probably
by facilitating complete withdrawal of milk from the udder
(Sedano et al. 2010). In contrast, some authors described a
negative impact of use of calves for milk let-down (Shittu
et al. 2012) since calves may transmit pathogens from one
quarter to another. The SCM prevalence increased with the
increased herd size in the farm (OR = 1.072). This situation
has also been mentioned in previous study in Pemba
(Suleiman et al. 2013). Prevalence of SCM was less in farms

that milked their cows twice a day compared to those milked
their cows once a day. Milking a cow twice per day may
reduce the volume of pathogens in the udder and hence reduce
prevalence. Moreover, the complete removal of the milk dur-
ing milking may reduce nutrients for the pathogens to grow.
The prevalence increased with increased number of parity
(P = 0.005) and stage of lactation (P = 0.001). This may be
caused by decreased cow immunity in older animals com-
pared to young cows, or weakness in sphincter muscle leaving
the teat orifice open after milking. Similar findings were ob-
served by other researchers (Karimuribo et al. 2008; Moges
et al. 2011). Farmers using towels to dry their cow before and
after milking had more infected cows (P = 0.015) probably
due to the use of the same towel for all cows in the shed which
results in the distribution of infection from one cow to another.
The prevalence as defined by bacteria isolation seem to be
reduced as the milk production increase (OR = 0.94), probably
due to the low concentration of pathogen in the milk.

Multi-drug resistance is threat to the control and treatment
of mastitis since it reduces choice of drug to be used. Most
farmers in the study area use penicillin, streptomycin and tet-
racycline to treat their animals and a combination of penicillin
and neomycin or kanamycin for intra-mammary infusion.
Major bacterial pathogens isolated were resistant to those
common antibiotics used to treat bovine mastitis and other
bacterial diseases in the study area. Some drugs such as pen-
icillin are no longer appropriate for the treatment of mastitis
since 87.6% of the pathogens isolated were resistant to peni-
cillin. High prevalence of antimicrobial resistance that found
in this study does not differ much with what has been previ-
ously described in other parts of Africa (Kasozi et al. 2014;
Ibrahim et al. 2014). Multi-drug resistance in veterinary med-
icine may raise a huge public health concern since the same
drugs are used to treat infections in the human population. The
threat may be by introducing antibiotic residue into the human
food chain that may leads to the direct or indirect toxicity or
allergic reaction; or by failure therapy to the common clinical
diseases (Vishnuraj et al. 2016). Most farmers use drugs to
treat their animals without proper advice from qualified veter-
inarians and do not abide to the withdrawal period indicated as
described before (Tilahun and Aylate 2015).

Conclusion

Bovine mastitis has long been considered to be a disease of
economic importance in the dairy industry. A high percent-
age of farmers reporting cases of clinical mastitis (CM) and a
high prevalence of SCM observed during this study are the
evidence of the problems’ extent in Zanzibar. CMT screen-
ing test provides useful information about the status of mas-
titis under field circumstance. Bacteria isolation could pro-
vide detailed information about the status and nature of

pathogen involved. Antimicrobial testing could also be use-
ful tool to diagnose which antibacterial should be used in
each case of mastitis. Based on the finding of this study,
various farm and cow level risk factors could play a role in
the increased occurrence of SCM.
