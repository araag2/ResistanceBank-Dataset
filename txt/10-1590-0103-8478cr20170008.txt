ABSTRACT: This study focused on counting Staphylococcus spp. in curd cheeses “requeijão” and “especialidade láctea type requeijão” 
sold in Brazil, assessing the presence of mecA gene in obtained isolates and establishing antimicrobial resistance profile of the mecA gene 
positive isolates. To this, a set of 200 samples of these dairy products were evaluated. Low counts of Staphylococcus spp. were observed in 
these dairy products. All the isolates were determined as coagulase-negative strains using coagulase test and PCR. However, two isolates 
(3.70%) were carriers of mecA gene and they can be considered as risk for public health. These isolates presented resistance to penicillin, 
oxacillin and erythromycin. In conclusion, low counts of Staphylococcus were detected in curd cheese “requeijão” and “especialidade láctea 
type requeijão” sold in Brazil. However, coagulase-negative methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. was detected in these dairy products. 
This is the first report of the detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. in heat-treated dairy products in Brazil. Results served as a 
warning to public sanitary authorities to control multidrug-resistant strains in veterinary and human medicine.  

Isolamento  de  Staphylococcus  spp.  resistente  à  meticilina  de  queijos  fundidos  requeijão  e  

especialidade  láctea  tipo  requeijão  comercializados  no  Brasil

RESUMO: Este trabalho objetivou realizar a contagem de Staphylococcus spp. em queijos fundidos “requeijão” e “especialidade láctea 
tipo  requeijão”  comercializados  no  Brasil,  verificar  a  presença  do  gene  mecA  nos  isolados  obtidos  e  estabelecer  o  perfil  de  resistência 
antimicrobiana dos isolados positivos para tal gene. Para isso, 200 amostras desses produtos lácteos foram avaliadas. Baixas contagens de 
Staphylococcus spp. foram observadas nas amostras. Todos os isolados foram considerados como coagulase-negativos através do teste da 
coagulase e através da PCR. Entretanto, em dois isolados (3,70%) foi possível detectar o gene mecA e representam potencial risco à saúde 
pública. Esses isolados apresentaram resistência a penicilina, oxacilina e eritromicina. Conclui-se que baixas contagens de Staphylococcus 
foram  detectadas  em  queijos  fundidos  “requeijão”  e  “especialidade  láctea  type  requeijão”.  Entretanto,  cepas  de  Staphylococcus  spp. 
coagulase-negativas e resistentes à meticilina foram detectadas nesses derivados lácteos. Esse é o primeiro relato da ocorrência de cepas de 
Staphylococcus spp. resistentes à meticilina em produtos lácteos termicamente tratados comercializados no Brasil. Os resultados servem como 
um alerta para as autoridades sanitárias públicas nacionais para o controle de cepas multirresistentes em medicina veterinária e humana.

INTRODUCTION

“Requeijão” is the third most sold cheese in 
Brazil (ZACARCHENCO et al., 2012). “Requeijão” is 
defined as “the product obtained using acid or enzymatic 
milk coagulation followed by the curd mass fusion (80ºC 
for 5 seconds), whey removal and washing according to 
Brazilian  legislation  (BRAZIL,  1997).  Also,  addition 
of  milk  cream,  butter  or  butter  oil  in  its  composition 
is  allowed.  Another  curd  cheese  routinely  consumed 
in  Brazil  is  “especialidade  láctea  type  requeijão”,  a 
similar cheese produced using the same process but the 

addition of vegetable ingredients such as corn starch and 
vegetable oil is allowed in composition. 

The  genus  Staphylococcus  is  among 
the  most  important  pathogenic  bacteria  reported 
in  dairy  products. This  genus  is  divided  into  two 
groups: coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative 
strains. Among the first one, S. aureus is known for 
its clinical importance and as a foodborne pathogen. 
The  coagulase-negative  group  is  comprised  by 
several species involved in opportunistic infections 
in  immunocompromised  patients  (MARTINS  & 
CUNHA, 2007).

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. isolated from curd cheese “requeijão” and “especialidade láctea type requeijão”...Ciência Rural, v.47, n.7, 2017.2

Staphylococcus  spp.  are  also  frequently 
associated  to  mastitis  (PITKALA  et  al.,  2004), 
biofilm  formation  (OTTO,  2009)  and  are  closely 
related to improper food handling of food handlers 
(ARGUDÍN  et  al.,  2012),  leading  contamination 
of  milk  and  other  dairy  products,  posing  public 
health into risk. Consequently, Staphylococcus spp. 
antimicrobial  resistance  is  a  concern  for  public 
health (KOKSAL et al., 2009). 

Methicillin  resistance  is  an  increasing 
global  problem  (MARTINS  &  CUNHA,  2007), 
even  for  domestic  animals  (CUNY  et  al,  2010). 
The presence of these isolates in food and animals 
highlight the potential risk for human transmission 
(WEESE & DUJIKEREN, 2010). Some researchers 
have  reported  strains  of  methicillin  resistant 
Staphylococcus  spp. 
(MRS)  causing  mastitis 
(MOON et al., 2007), in bulk tank milk (VIRGIN et 
al., 2009), in bovine milk, pecorino and mozzarella 
cheeses (NORMANO et al., 2009) and in raw meats 
(BOER et al., 2009). Based on all these information, 
this study focused on counting Staphylococcus spp. 
in  curd  cheeses  “requeijão”  and  “especialidade 
láctea type requeijão” sold in Brazil, assessing the 
presence  of  mecA  gene  in  obtained  isolates  and 
establishing  antimicrobial  resistance  profile  of  the 
mecA gene positive isolates.

MATERIALS   AND   METHODS

This research was performed using samples 
of  “requeijão”,  “requeijão  light”,  “especialidade 
láctea type requeijão” and “especialidade láctea type 
requeijão light”, obtained from supermarkets located 
in the municipality of Jaboticabal, state of São Paulo, 
Brazil, during the year of 2015. Samples were kept 
refrigerated  in  cooler  boxes  with  ice,  during  the 
transport  to  laboratory.  Each  kind  of  dairy  product 
(“requeijão”, 
“especialidade 
láctea type requeijão”) had 50 samples bought, from 
5  different  commercials  brands,  each  one  with  2 
different  production  lots  (each  lot  composed  by  5 
samples). For the “especialidade láctea type requeijão 
light”, 
three  different 
commercial brands and 10 different production lots 
(each  lot  composed  by  5  samples).  In  total,  200 
samples were used for this study. 

the  samples  were  from 

“requeijão 

light”, 

For  each  sample,  25g  was  placed  into 
a  Scott  Bottle  containing  225mL  of  0.1%  peptone 
water (Difco, Detroit, USA). Out of this first dilution 
(10-1),  other  serial  dilutions  were  performed,  until 
10-3.  Selective  plating  was  done  using  0.1mL  of 
these dilutions in Baird-Parker agar (Difco, Detroit, 

USA). Plates were incubated for 45-48 hours under 
35ºC.    Whenever  black  colonies  grew  in  the  agar, 
it  was  transferred  to  a  tube  with  Tryptic  Soy Agar 
(TSA) (Difco, Detroit, USA) medium, and incubated 
for 24 hours under 35ºC (APHA, 2011). Moreover, 
the  colonies  were  transferred  to  tubes  containing 
Brain  Heart  Infusion  broth  (BHI)  (Difco,  Detroit, 
USA)  and  incubated  for  24  hours  under  37ºC. The 
coagulase test was performed using the isolates from 
BHI broth and rabbit plasma, in order to assess the 
presence of coagulase-positive strains (APHA, 2011).
The DNA from the 57 isolates was extracted 
according to the method described by KESKIMAKI 
et  al.  (2001).  Presence  of  Staphylococcus  spp. 
and  S.  aureus  DNA  molecules  was  detected  using 
primers 16SrRNA (Pereira et al., 2009) and Sa442-
1/2  (MOROT-BIZOT  et  al.,  2004).  A  PCR  also 
was  performed 
identify  coagulase-positive 
Staphylococcus  spp.  (S.  intermedius,  S.  schleiferi 
subsp.  coagulans,  S.  hyicus,  S.  lutrae,  S.  delphini, 
and  S.  pseudintermedius  according  to  SASAKI  et 
al.  (2010)  (Table  1).  In  order  to  detect  methicillin-
resistant isolates (mecA), a PCR was performed using 
the primers as described by GORTEL et al. (1999): 5’ 
AAA ATC GAT GGT AAA GGT TGG C 3’ e 5’ AGT 
TCT GCA GTA CCG GAT TTG C 3’, with a 533bp 
product and 55°C annealing temperature.

PCR amplifications were carried out with 
mixtures containing PCR buffer 1x [100mM Tris-HCl 
pH 8.8; 500mMKCl; 0.8% (v/v) Nonidet P40]; MgCl2 
2mM; dNTP’s 0.2mM, 1.5U de Taq DNA polymerase, 
5pmol of each primer, 60ng genomic DNA and sterile 
water  until  reaching  the  volume  of  20µL.  Cycling 
conditions  consisted  of  an  initial  step  at  95°C  for 
5min,  followed  by  35  cycles  at  94ºC  for  1min, 
annealing at the specific temperature of each primer 
for  1min  and  72ºC  for  1.5min.  The  final  extension 
was at 72°C for 10min. The amplified products were 
visualized in a 1% agarose gel electrophoresis stained 
with  0.5µg  mL-1  ethidium  bromide  (Vetec,  São 
Paulo, Brazil). A previously known molecular weight 
marker was used as a reference (GeneRuler 1kb DNA 
Ladder  –  Fermentas,  Thermo  Fish  Scientific,  São 
Paulo, Brazil).

to 

MRS  positive  isolates  were  examined 
for resistance to 11 antimicrobials by disk-diffusion 
(Kirby-Bauer)  method.  The 
following  disks 
(LaborclinTM)  were  used:  oxacillin  (1µg),  cefepime 
(30µg),  rifampicin  (5µg),  chloramphenicol  (30µg), 
clindamyicin (2µg), erythromycin (15µg), penicillin 
(23,75/1,25μg),

tetracycline 
(30µg), 
(10µg) 
and ciprofloxacin (5µg).

the 
 
Staphylococcus  spp.  counting  of  the  groups  was 
assessed through a variance analysis and the Kruskall-
Wallis  test  with  5%  of  significance  level.  Data 
regarding the “presence or absence” of Staphylococcus 
spp. in the samples group (comparison among light 
and  normal  products;  and  among  “requeijão”  and 
“especialidade láctea” products) was performed using 
the chi-square test with 5% of significance level. The 
analyses were performed using Software R®.

RESULTS   AND   DISCUSSION

Table  2  presents  Staphylococcus  spp. 
counts  of  the  dairy  product  samples  analyzed  in 

this  study.  Results  of  Staphylococcus  spp.  count 
did not meet the necessary requirements to perform 
the  variance  analysis.  Moreover,  when  using  the 
nonparametric  Kruskal-Wallis 
test  with  5%  of 
significance level, no statistical significance (P>0.05) 
was observed among these products. The chi-square 
test performed to evaluate the difference among the 
presence or absence of these microorganisms in the 
products also presented no significance (P>0.05)

Staphylococcus spp. count in the samples 
was  low  and  all  the  strains  were  considered  as 
coagulase-negative  strains  on  coagulase-test.  S. 
aureus is considered as the most important foodborne 
pathogen  of  this  group  and  it  is  considered  as 
coagulase-positive  specie.  Based  on  such  results,

it is possible to state that the consumption of these 
dairy  products  does  not  directly  pose  risk  to  the 
Brazilian  population,  with  regard  to  foodborne 
 
illness  occurrence.  Furthermore,  the  low  number 
of  the  pathogen  observed  in  the  samples  could  be 
explained by the high temperature processes used in 
the production flowchart  (BRAZIL, 1997) and good 
manufacturing  practices  implementation  in  these 
industries (SANTANA et al., 2009).  

A  set  of  57  isolates  were  subjected  to  a 
PCR in order to confirm if they were Staphylococcus 
spp. (PEREIRA et al., 2009), S. aureus (MOROT-
BIZOT  et  al.,  2004)  or  other  coagulase-positive 
Staphylococcus  spp.  (S.  intermedius,  S.  schleiferi 
subsp.  coagulans,  S.  hyicus,  S.  lutrae,  S.  delphini, 
and S. pseudintermedius (SASAKI et al., 2010). In 

total 54 isolates were confirmed as Staphylococcus 
spp.  with  amplification  of 
the  corresponding 
product.  There  were  no  amplification  products 
using  primers  for  Staphylococcus  spp.  coagulase-
positive,  agreeing  with  the  coagulase-test  results 
and  allowing  us  to  confirm  that  all  isolates  were 
coagulase-negative strains.

Using PCR to detect the presence of mecA 
gene,  one  isolate  obtained  from  “requeijão  light” 
(brand  C  and  lot  2)  and  another  isolate  obtained 
from  “especialidade  láctea  type  requeijão  light” 
(brand  C  and  lot  2)  were  considered  as  positive. 
The  prevalence  of  methicillin-resistant  coagulase-
negative  Staphylococcus  spp.  in  evaluated  samples 
was 3.70% among the 54 isolates. This two isolates 
showed  resistance  to  oxacillin,  penicillin  G  and

(HUBER et al., 2011).

and 

it 

NORMANNO  et  al.  (2007)  established 
3.75%  as  the  prevalence  of  methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus  spp.  in  milk  and  dairy  products 
in  Italy  highlighting  the  role  of  dairy  products  in  
transmission  of  antimicrobial-resistant  bacteria 
to  humans.  Furthermore,  some  authors  isolated 
strains  of  Staphylococcus  spp.  methicillin-resistant 
from  some  food  such  as:  cow’s  milk,  pecorino  and 
mozzarella  cheeses  (NORMANO  et  al.,  2009) 
and  raw  meat  (BOER  et  al.,  2009).  However,  the 
occurrence  of  methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus 
spp.  in  “requeijão”  and  “especialidade  láctea”,  or 
even  in  any  other  heat-treated  dairy  product,  was 
never reported in Brazil, until this paper. 

coagulase-negative 

“Requeijão” is one of the most consumed 
in  Brazil  and 
is  usually  consumed 
cheeses 
raw  (ZACARCHENCO  et  al.,  2012).  Presence 
of 
methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus spp. strains in these products present a 
risk to the country’s public health. Thus, considering the 
potential implications in food production chain, there 
is a need to be constantly monitoring the employers’ 
health  and  hygiene,  once  humans  can  be  colonized 
by contact during food processing or consumption of 
contaminated food (KLUYTMANS, 2009). 

Moreover,  nowadays  coagulase-negative 
Staphylococcus  spp. 
is  considered  as  able  on 
transferring  antimicrobial  resistance  genes  to  other 
Staphylococcus spp. strains (TULINSKI et al., 2012). 
Human  infections  caused  by  methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus  spp.  are  increasing  (MARTINS  & 
CUNHA, 2007), even in animals (CUNY et al., 2010), 
being considered an emergent problem in veterinary 
medicine  and  public  health  (HUBER  et  al.,  2011). 
Animals  usually  are  infected  and  colonized  during 
contact with humans and vice-versa (GRAVELAND 
et  al.,  2010).  Consequently,  prophylactic  measures 
to  avoid  methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus  spp. 
contamination in foods and infections in humans and 
animals are required in order to reduce risk in Brazil.

CONCLUSION

In  conclusion,  processing 

technology 
ensures  the  safety  of  these  products  categories; 
however, they may be carriers of methicillin resistant 

5

Staphylococcus  spp.  strains.  Results  served  as  a 
warning  to  Brazilian  public  sanitary  authorities  to 
control  multidrug-resistant  strains  in  veterinary  and 
human medicine.
