The current study was carried out to detect Salmonella spp. contamination on poultry and poultry
environmental samples of layer farms situated in Bareilly and to determine the antibiotic susceptibility
proÔ¨Åles and serotype distribution of the isolates. A total of 720 samples of egg, feed, water, cloaca, and
faeces were collected and screened for the presence of Salmonella. Twenty four (3.3%) of the samples
tested were found to be positive for Salmonella. Out of 180 chicken eggs, 120 poultry feed samples, 120
poultry water samples, 120 fecal samples and 180 cloacal swabs, the isolation frequencies of Salmonella
spp. were 3.3%, 2.5%, 3.3%, 2.5% and 4.4% respectively. Among the isolates, Salmonella Typhimurium was
the predominant serovar. The antibiogram testing revealed differential multi-drug resistance among
Salmonella isolates in poultry and poultry environment samples. All the isolates were resistant to clin-
damycin, oxacillin, penicillin and vancomycin whereas sensitivity was recorded for ampicillin, enro-
Ô¨Çoxacin and colistin. As a result, the relatively high resistance among the bacteria present in poultry
could pose public health and therapeutic problems to consumers as potential vehicles of resistant Sal-
monella foodborne infections.

1. Introduction

Salmonella is widely distributed throughout the world and the
most important bacterial agent implicated in outbreaks of the
foodborne disease. It is a direct occupational anthropozoonosis
disease of great economic and public health signiÔ¨Åcance. Poultry
egg and food products containing egg are the primary vehicle of
infection caused by Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella
Enteritidis and cause egg-borne human salmonellosis (Messens
et al., 2007; Singh, Yadav, Singh, & Bharti, 2010). Salmonella
also cause infection in poultry birds. Several factors contribute
to the spread of Salmonella in poultry; of these feed and water
contaminated with Salmonella are important sources of infection
(Frederick & Huda, 2011).
feeders,
litter and the air inside poultry houses are also critical to
horizontal transmission (Hoover, Kenney, Amick, & Hypes, 1997)
of Salmonella. The contaminated poultry environment
leads
to Salmonella transmission either by vertical or horizontal

transmission (Singh et al., 2010). However, adequate literature is
not available about the presence of Salmonella in the poultry
environment in Bareilly (north India) region. Therefore, studies
are needed to verify the occurrence of Salmonella in the poultry
environment in this region.

The antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella is an increasing
problem and has become a public health issue worldwide (Kaye,
Engemann, Fraimow, & Abrutyn, 2004). Eventually, most of the
Salmonella isolates have developed resistance against multiple
drugs due to their indiscriminate, repeated abusive applications.
Overall frequencies and patterns of resistance can vary remarkably
from one country to another. Variation in resistance is also asso-
ciated with the time of the year, the serovar of Salmonella, broilers
versus layer, one farm versus another and the particular antimi-
crobial agent (Yildirim, Gonulalan, Pamuk, & Ertas, 2011). There-
fore, farm level screening of Salmonella for antimicrobial resistance
could be of great importance in the control of Salmonella infection
in poultry. The aim of the study was to detect Salmonella spp.
contamination on poultry and poultry environmental samples of
layer farms situated in Bareilly (north India) and to determine the
antibiotic susceptibility proÔ¨Åles and serotype distribution of the
isolates.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sample collection

In the present study 180 chicken eggs, 120 samples each of layer
feed, drinking water, faeces and 180 layer cloacal samples (total
720) were collected from 180 White Leghorn layers at Ô¨Åve different
farms near to the Bareilly of north India. The samples were trans-
ported to laboratory under the aseptic conditions and processed
immediately for Salmonella isolation.

(10 mg), nitrofurantoin (300 mg), oxacillin (1 mg), streptomycin
(10 mg), colistin (10 mg), chloramphenicol (30 mg), penicillin (10 mg),
co-trimoxazole (23.75 mg), enroÔ¨Çoxacin (10 mg), kanamycin (30 mg)
and vancomycin (30 mg). Results were evaluated according to CLSI
zone diameter interpretive standards and minimal inhibitory con-
centration (MIC) breakpoints or the manufacturer‚Äôs recommenda-
tions. Strains were evaluated as susceptible,
intermediate or
resistant. Multiple antibiotic resistances (MARs) index for each
resistance pattern was calculated by the formula given in Table 3
(Singh et al., 2010).

3. Results and discussion

2.2.1. Egg shell surface, egg yolk, cloaca, feed, water and faeces

For isolation of Salmonella from egg shell surface, a sterile
cotton swab soaked in sterilized normal saline solution (NSS) was
used for egg surface swabbing, and re-immersed into the same
tube having 10 ml normal saline solution, then transferred to
90 ml of Buffered Peptone Water (BPW) and incubated at 37 C for
18 h. For isolation of Salmonella from egg yolk, Ô¨Åve ml of yolk was
mixed with 5 ml of NSS and transferred to 90 ml of BPW and
incubated at 37 C for 18 h. Similarly, cloacal swabbings were re-
immersed into the same tube with 10 ml of BPW and incubated at
37 C for 18 h. For isolation of Salmonella from feed, 10 g of feed
was inoculated in 90 ml of BPW and incubated at 37 C for 18 h.
For isolation of Salmonella from drinking water and faeces, 1 ml of
drinking water and 1 g of faeces were separately inoculated in
9 ml of BPW and incubated at 37 C for 18 h. All the samples were
further processed for Salmonella identiÔ¨Åcation as per protocol
given in Section 2.2.2.

2.2.2.

IdentiÔ¨Åcation of Salmonella

After pre-enrichment in BPW, 0.1 ml of pre-enriched samples
were added to 10 ml of Rappaport Vassiliadis broth for all the
samples individually and incubated at 37 C for 24 h. The enriched,
samples were streaked on Hektoen Enteric Agar plates and incu-
bated at 37 C for 24 h. After incubation, typical black centred and
smooth colonies showing greenish periphery giving bull eye
appearance on plates were selected and subjected to biochemical
characterization (motility, nitrate reduction, indole test, methyl red,
Voges proskauer, citrate utilization, urease) as per the standard
methods (Agarwal, Bhilegaonkar, Singh, Kumar, & Rathore, 2003).
Serotyping of Salmonella isolates was done by standard method
(Kauffmann, 1971) at National Salmonella Centre (Vet.), Indian
Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, Bareilly.

2.3. Antimicrobial sensitivity test

Antibiotic sensitivity of the isolates was performed according to
agar disc diffusion method on MuellereHinton Agar (CLSI, 2008).
The antibiotic discs (antibiotic concentration in mcg) used were
consisted of ampicillin (10 mg), amoxicillin (20 mg), clindamycin
(2 mg), ciproÔ¨Çoxacin (10 mg), tetracycline (30 mg), gentamicin

3.1.

Isolation of Salmonella from eggs, feed, water, faeces and cloaca

Of the total 720 samples screened, only 24 (3.3%) tested positive
for the Salmonella spp. Out of 180 chicken eggs screened, 6 (3.3%)
were found positive for Salmonella (Table 1). Of these, 4 (66.7%) had
only surface contamination while the 2 (33.3%) revealed contami-
nated yolk and shell. A total 8 isolates were detected from 6 eggs
(Table 1). The present results indicated the incidence of Salmonella
in chicken egg samples at 3.3% with a higher incidence level on the
egg shell surface than contents (yolk). The higher incidence of
surface contamination may be through faeces, feed and insects,
whereas the internal contamination may either be due to pene-
tration of the organisms from the surface to the inside of egg or else
the layer hens might have systemic infection in their reproductive
tissue (Barnhart, Dressen, Bastien, & Pancorbs, 1991). Our results
indicated that incidence of Salmonella in chicken eggs is low in the
north India and almost similar to the previous studies conducted in
the same region (Singh et al., 2010) with a higher incidence on shell
surface than the yolk (Krishamoorthy, Paul, Premkumar, &
Govindarajan, 2003). In contrast, a higher (10.8%) rate of Salmo-
nella incidence has been reported in chicken egg in other part of
India (Bajaj, Sharma, & Thakur, 2003). The low Salmonella incidence
in poultry farms in this particular region may be due to the appli-
cation of effective control measures.

Feed and water has been implicated as an important source of
Salmonella infection to poultry birds (Frederick & Huda, 2011). We
observed 2.5% Salmonella in poultry feed samples. Previous studies
reported higher isolation rate (22.2%) of Salmonella from 36 bulk
commercial poultry feed samples (Okoli, Ndujine, & Ogbuwa, 2006)
which are high than our results. The incidence of Salmonella in
drinking water was 3.3% which is less than 36% reported by
Sasipreeyajan, Jerngklinchan, Koowtananukul, and Saitanu (1996)
in Thailand. However, no information is available in literature on
Salmonella occurrence in poultry feed and water in India. Therefore,
we could not compare our results in an Indian context. Of the 180
samples of cloacal swabs collected from 180 birds in the present
study, only 4.4% tested positive to Salmonella. Li, Payne, Santos,
Levine, and AndersonSheldon (2007) reported a higher (30.8%)
prevalence rate of Salmonella in faeces collected from layers.
Sasipreeyajan et al. (1996) also reported higher isolation rate (13%)

from cloacal swab samples of 13 broiler Ô¨Çocks, 15 layer Ô¨Çocks and 7
parent breeder Ô¨Çocks in Thailand. The presence of Salmonella in
faeces indicates its colonization inside the live birds and this may
be due to poultry environment contamination. The low Salmonella
incidence in poultry environment samples observed in the present
study could be the reason of less Salmonella incidence in faeces.
Apart from that environmental factors (water activity, temperature)
and management practices (animal density, housing) may also in-
Ô¨Çuence the Salmonella status in a Ô¨Çock irrespective of their Sal-
monella positive or negative status (Frederick & Huda, 2011).

Out of 26 isolates, 14 serotyped as S. Typhimurium indicating a
prevalence rate of 53.85%. Other isolates serotyped as S. Kottbus (8),
S. II (3), and S. Senftenberg (1). Previously, Singh et al. (2010) re-
ported 55.5% S. Typhimurium among all the Salmonella isolated in
the similar region thereby corroborating the current Ô¨Åndings.
Murugkar, Rahman, Kumar, and Bhattacharyya (2005) reported a
high pre-dominance of S. Typhimurium with some case of S.
Enteritidis in cloacal swabs of poultry in north-eastern parts of
India. Among all the serovars of Salmonella, S. Typhimurium and S.
Enteritidis have been of great concern from the standpoint of egg-
borne human salmonellosis. The detection of S. Typhimurium as a
predominant serovar in this study therefore raises a public health
issues in this particular region of India. The absence of S. Enteritidis,
a main zoonotic serovar of poultry and poultry products, in the
present study is of interest, and is similar to that reported earlier by
Singh et al. (2010). The main reason for the prevalence of other
Salmonella serovars instead of S. Enteritidis in poultry eggs and
poultry environmental samples may be due to their adaptability to
environmental conditions indicating the changing dynamics of
Salmonella serovars occurrence in this region.

3.2. Antimicrobial sensitivity/resistance of pattern analysis

Results on the resistance proÔ¨Åle of Salmonella strains against 16
antimicrobial agents evaluated in this study have been presented in
Tables 2 and 3. The three antibiotics ampicillin, enroÔ¨Çoxacin, and
colistin were found to be 100% effective, whereas varying degree of
sensitivity are shown by other agents: ciproÔ¨Çoxacin (88.5), kana-
mycin (88.5), chloramphenicol (76.9), gentamicin (84.6), strepto-
mycin (80.7), nitrofurantoin (46.1),
(76.9),
tetracycline (80.7) and amoxicillin (65.3). The isolates were resis-
tant to the extent of 100% to clindamycin, oxacillin, penicillin and
vancomycin. We observed variation in resistance of Salmonella spp.

for a few antimicrobial agents viz. to penicillin (100%), oxacillin
(97%), clindamycin (97%) and vancomycin (92.6%) in study per-
formed earlier by Yildirim et al. (2011). The prevalence of resistant
samples to penicillin, oxacillin, clindamycin and vancomycin can be
explained by their frequent administration in veterinary medicine.
Previous studies conducted in the north India demonstrated 100%
resistance to colistin (Singh et al., 2010). However, we did not
observe resistance to colistin which is a indication that resistance
can vary remarkably from one farm to another (Yildirim et al.,
2011). In the present study, the highest level of antimicrobial
resistance proÔ¨Åle was recorded for poultry feed isolates (0.688
MARs index) followed by faeces (0.563), cloaca (0.563), drinking
water (0.25) and eggs (0.25). 23.08% of the isolates were resistant to
co-trimoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and tetracycline. The results are in
agreement with those of Okoli et al. (2006) and Chatlod (2007)
where Salmonella isolates from commercial poultry feeds showed
antimicrobial resistance against nitrofurantoin and tetracycline.
Possible reasons for resistance against these antibiotics may have
been their indiscriminate use in livestock production and animal
husbandry (Cohen & Tauxe, 1986). Keeping in view the change in
resistance showed by Salmonella serovars from one place to
another, the assessment of antibiogram of Salmonella isolates at
farm level is often advantageous for identiÔ¨Åcation of effective
antimicrobial agent.
