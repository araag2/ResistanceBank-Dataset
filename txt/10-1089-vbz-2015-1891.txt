Abstract

Staphylococcus aureus in food is a consequence of inadequate hygienic handling and processing, posing a
potential risk to public health. The current study aimed to characterize virulence factors, as well as antimi-
crobial resistance of Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolated from retail
chicken products and hand swabs from vendors in Egypt. In addition, genetic relatedness of the isolates from
chicken and humans was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism
(PCR-RFLP) using protein A as a target. A total of 110 samples were collected from chicken products (n = 80)
and vendors (n = 30). Overall, 30 (37.5%) chicken products samples were positive for S. aureus, whereas hand
swabs from meat handlers revealed that 18 (60%) were positive. Ten MRSA strains were characterized by the
presence of the mecA gene, comprising seven isolates from chicken and three from humans. Virulence-
associated factors were evaluated by PCR, revealing that 31.3% of S. aureus isolates harbored the Panton–
Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene, whereas 10.4% were positive for the sea and sed genes each, and only two
isolates were positive for c-hemolysin–associated gene. Genotyping using spa PCR-RFLP showed identical
restriction banding patterns of MRSA isolates of human and chicken meat origin, indicating the genetic
relatedness of the isolates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to characterize PVL-positive
MRSA from chicken products and to utilize spa-RFLP for evaluating the genetic relatedness between MRSA of
human and chicken origin in Egypt.

Key Words: S. aureus—MRSA—PVL—c-Hemolysin—Enterotoxins—spa-PCR-RFLP.

Introduction

T he poultry industry in Egypt has grown in the last

years to keep up with the increased trend of consump-
tion. Staphylococcus aureus is a widespread foodborne
pathogen colonizing the nasal passages, skin, and intestinal
tracts of different animals and humans (Hanson et al. 2011).
The presence of S. aureus in food could be attributed to the
contamination of raw meat during slaughtering, processing,
and storage (Tassew et al. 2010, Hennekinne et al. 2012).
Food poisoning due to S. aureus enterotoxins is ranked third
worldwide; in addition, these toxins are heat stable, and as
few as 20–100 ng of the toxin can produce illness (Asao et al.
2003, Schelin et al. 2011).

Resistance to antibiotics is an increasing concern worldwide
and is associated mainly with uncontrolled usage of antimi-
crobials for treatment or as growth promoters in food animals
(Barber et al. 2003). S. aureus resistant to penicillinase-
resistant pencillins is referred to as methicillin-resistant
S. aureus (MRSA). Resistance of methicillin is mediated by
the mecA gene, which encodes penicillin-binding protein 2a,
with a decreased binding afﬁnity for b-lactams (Chambers
1997). Because of its multidrug resistance pattern, MRSA is
considered a public health concern, especially for immuno-
compromised patients (Pesavento et al. 2007, Kraushaar and
Fetsch 2014). Panton–Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is one of
the important exotoxins causing severe skin and soft tissue
infections and necrotizing pneumonia (Kraushaar and Fetsch

2014). The association of PVL with progressive, hemorrhagic,
and necrotizing pneumonia has been reported in cases of
community-acquired infection with MRSA (Gillet et al. 2002).
c-Hemolysin is also a toxin causing damage to erythrocytes
(Prevost et al. 1995). The gene is encoded by the hlg locus, and
previous reports have described the gene in more than 99% of
S. aureus strains (Prevost et al. 1995). Production of entero-
toxins by S. aureus is another virulence-associated factor that
has an impact on the pathogenicity of the isolates. Eleven
antigenic types of enterotoxins (staphylococcal enterotoxin
type A [SEA] to SE type E [SEE]) are recognized; of them,
SEA is considered the most commonly involved enterotoxin
with human infection (Balaban and Rasooly 2000).

Typing of MRSA is essential for tracing the source of
infection; therefore, typing methods should have the advan-
tages of typeability, reproducibility, and good discriminatory
power (Wichelhaus et al. 2001). Different molecular meth-
ods, e.g., pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE), have been
described as the gold standard typing method; however,
PFGE is not widely used due to expense, time required, and
sophisticated application (Wichelhaus et al. 2001). Molecular
typing of S. aureus using polymerase chain reaction–
restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) has
been shown to be of sufﬁciently high accuracy and corre-
sponds to PFGE typing (Omar et al. 2014).

This study aimed to assess retail chicken products sold in
Egypt as a potential vehicle for S. aureus and MRSA. Anti-
microbial resistance proﬁling and molecular characterization
of some virulence factors of the isolates obtained were car-
ried out. Moreover, the genetic relatedness of MRSA isolates
of human and chicken origin was determined by protein A
(spa) PCR-RFLP.

Materials and Methods

Sampling and isolation of S. aureus

A total of 80 chicken products’ samples (40 raw chicken
breast ﬁllet, 20 sliced luncheon meat, and 20 chicken nug-
gets) were collected randomly from local pluck-shop markets
and outlets at Sharkia Governorate, Egypt. Moreover, 30
hand swabs from chicken handlers at the pluck-shop markets
and outlets were collected. Twenty-ﬁve grams from each
sample were homogenized with 225 mL of buffered peptone
water (BPW; cat. no. CM509, Oxoid, Adelaide, Australia) for
pre-enrichment and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. A loopful
from the pre-enriched culture homogenate in BPW was in-
oculated onto Baird–Parker agar medium (cat. no. CM0275,
Oxoid, Adelaide, Australia) and incubated at 37°C for 24 h
(ISO-6888-1, 1999). In addition, serial dilutions were pre-
pared for S. aureus count. One suspected S. aureus colony
from each plate was subjected to Gram staining and bio-
chemical identiﬁcation (catalase, coagulase, oxidase, and
DNase). S. aureus identiﬁcation was then conﬁrmed by am-
pliﬁcation of the species-speciﬁc nuc gene (Gao et al. 2011).

Antimicrobial susceptibility test

A disc diffusion test was carried out to detect the minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) of S. aureus isolates against 14
antimicrobials according to National Committee for Clinical
Laboratory Standards (NCCLS 2013). The antibiotics that
were used to evaluate resistance are listed in Table 2 (below).

Molecular characterization and spa-RFLP

S. aureus isolates were subjected to PCR for the detec-
tion of mecA (Zhang et al. 2004), PVL (Lina et al. 1999),
c-hemolysin (Kumar et al. 2009), and enterotoxin encoding
genes (sea, sec, and sed) (Mehrotra et al. 2000). Moreover,
MRSA strains isolated from different sources were subjected
to spa-PCR-RFLP for genotyping (Omar et al. 2014). Ex-
traction of the bacterial DNA was carried out using a QIAamp
DNA Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s guidelines
(Qiagen, Germany, GmbH). For restriction, HindIII enzyme
was used according to the protocol described by Omar et al.
(2014). The synthesized primers and the amplicon sizes are
summarized in the Table S1 (Supplementary Data are avail-
able at www.liebertpub/vbz/). Typeability of spa-RFLP is
deﬁned as the number of strains that are located in a type by a
typing system (Hallin et al. 2007).

Results

Biochemical identiﬁcation revealed that 67 isolates were
suspected S. aureus (data not shown). Only biochemically
suspected S. aureus isolates conﬁrmed by nuc gene PCR were
included in the study (n = 48). A total of 110 samples com-
prising 40 chicken breast ﬁllet, 20 sliced luncheon meat, 20
chicken nuggets, and 30 hand swabs from vendors were ex-
amined. Overall, 30 (37.5%) chicken samples were positive
for S. aureus, with isolation rates of 42.5%, 40%, and 25%
from chicken ﬁllet, nuggets, and sliced luncheon meat, re-
spectively (Table 1). The difference in the contamination rate
of the investigated products with S. aureus was insigniﬁcant
2 = 1.8, p = 0.4). Examination of hand swabs collected
(v1
from vendors revealed that 18 (60%) were positive for S.
aureus (Table 1). The total S. aureus counts in chicken
products were 3.4 · 104 – 8.4 · 103 (chicken ﬁllet), 1.1 · 104
– 3.3 · 103 (nuggets), and 6.3 · 104 – 1.5 · 104 (sliced lun-
cheon meat) (Table 1). Out of the examined isolates from
chicken (n = 80) and vendors (n = 30), the mecA gene speciﬁc
for MRSA was detected in seven (8.8%) and three (10%)
samples, respectively (Table 1).

The results of the antibiotic resistance of 48 S. aureus
isolates of chicken and human origin showed that all of the
isolates (100%) were sensitive to vancomycin, and only 7.8%
resistance was observed against oﬂoxacin (Table 2). High
resistance was detected against doxycycline (64.6%) and
amoxicillin (60.4%). However, resistance rates ranging from
18.8% and 47.9% were reported to the other examined anti-
microbials (Table 2).

Acquisition of virulence factor–associated genes was inves-
tigated by molecular ampliﬁcation of PVL-, c-hemolysin–, and
enterotoxin-associated genes (sea, sec, and sed) Fig. S1. The
results showed PVL, c-hemolysin–, sea-, and sed-associated
genes were detected, respectively, in 31.3%, 4.2%, 10.4%,
and 10.4% of the S. aureus isolates obtained (Table 3). The
comparable occurrence of PVL, c-hemolysin–, sea-, and sed-
associated genes in MRSA versus non-MRSA isolates was 90%
vs. 15.8%, 0 vs. 5.3%, 40% vs. 2.6%, and 30% vs. 5.3%, re-
spectively. None of the examined S. aureus isolates (MRSA or
non-MRSA) was positive for the sec-associated gene (Table 3).
Genotyping of the spa region in 10 MRSA isolates (seven
of chicken and three of human origin) showed that 80% of
the identiﬁed MRSA isolates produced a single band of
1200 bp (type S1), whereas only 20% produced no bands

(Fig. 1). The absence of PCR product is considered a sep-
arate type, namely S2. Restriction of the produced amplicon
by the HindIII enzyme produced two banding patterns of
240 bp and 696 bp (Fig. 1). The typeability of the method
was calculated to be 80%.

Discussion

Contaminated chicken meat is considered an important
source of foodborne pathogens posing risk for zoonotic
transmission (Osman et al. 2015). In the current study, the
proportion positive for S. aureus in chicken products’ sam-
ples was 37.5% (Table 1). In Egypt, S. aureus isolation rates
of 6% (EI-Jakee et al. 2013, Osman et al. 2015) and 77.6%
(Karmi 2013) from chicken meat samples have been re-
ported. The difference between the isolation rate obtained
and those previously reported in Egypt could be attributed to
the identiﬁcation of S. aureus isolates using only biochemical
identiﬁcation in the aforementioned three studies. Phenotypic
identiﬁcation of staphylococci has been reported to be un-
satisfactory, irreproducible, and unreliable (Heikens et al.
2005). Moreover, the variation could be attributed to the
sample size,
location, and hygienic measures posed by
chicken meat handlers (Bhargava et al. 2011). Comparable

isolation rates were reported in Japan (34.2%; Ogata et al.
2012), the United States (42.1%; Abdalrahman et al. 2015),
and South Africa (44%; Oguttu et al. 2014).

As illustrated in Table 1, S. aureus contamination was
found to be higher in chicken breast ﬁllet (42.5%) and nug-
gets (40%) than in sliced luncheon meat (25%); however, the
difference between the three products was insigniﬁcant. S.
aureus was recorded in 46.2% of chicken ﬁllets in Croatia
(Kozacinski et al. 2006), 75% of nuggets in Italy (Pepe et al.
2006), and 40% of luncheon meat samples in Egypt (Karmi
2013). The lower contamination rate of sliced luncheon meat
than chicken ﬁllet and nuggets might be attributed to the
complete heat treatment of luncheon meat during processing.
Although there was a low contamination rate of sliced lun-
cheon meat, the potential of handling after cooking is sus-
pected, which, in turn, poses a risk for human infection
(Oguttu et al. 2014).

MRSA is a potential cause of hospital-acquired infection;
however, community-acquired infections are also of growing
concern (Tiemersma et al. 2004, Witte et al. 2004). The
isolation rate of MRSA from chicken products in the present
study was 8.8% (Table 1). Similarly, 7.1% of chicken meat
samples were positive for MRSA in Korea (Cho et al. 2014).
Variable isolation rates of MRSA from chicken meat have

been reported in different studies (de Boer et al. 2009, Fessler
et al. 2011, Hanson et al. 2011, Agerso et al. 2012, Chairat
et al. 2015). The results obtained revealed that contamination
of poultry meat during slaughter is assumed to be the most
important source for infection of human consumers. Such an
assumption was supported by the reported observation in The
Netherlands that 8% of poultry were MRSA positive before
slaughtering; however, after slaughtering, 35% of poultry
meat was contaminated (Mulders et al. 2010).

Infected food handlers are responsible for foodborne ill-
nesses due to bacterial pathogens (Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention 2000). It has been estimated that more
than 50% of healthy individuals have a high prevalence of S.
aureus on the hands and ﬁngertips and that food handlers
have been involved in outbreaks ( Jones et al. 2002, Le Loir
et al. 2003, Lues et al. 2006). The results showed that 60% of
hand swabs collected from food handlers at retail markets
were positive for S. aureus, with MRSA comprising 10%
(Table 1). S. aureus was isolated from 57.5% of food handlers
in Botswana (Loeto et al. 2007) and 38.3% in Nigeria
(Okareh and Erhahon 2015). Moreover, in Nigeria, 48.8% of
hand swabs from meat handlers were positive for MRSA, and
the authors attributed such a high isolation rate to the ob-
served unhygienic handling of meat (Nnachi et al. 2014). On
the contrary, MRSA was not recovered from hand swabs of
meat handlers in The Netherlands as a consequence of the
continuous active surveillance against antibiotic-resistant
microorganisms (de Jonge et al. 2010).

According to the legal requirements of the Egyptian Or-
ganization for Standardization and Quality Control (EOSQC
2005), the permissible level of S. aureus in poultry meat varies
from one product to another. In chicken ﬁllets, S. aureus
should be less than 102 colony-forming units (CFU)/gram,

whereas partially and completely heat-treated chicken prod-
ucts (nuggets and luncheon meat, respectively) should be S.
aureus free. The results obtained showed that the mean S.
aureus count in chicken breast ﬁllet, nuggets, and sliced
luncheon meat are beyond the permissible limits of EOSQC
(Table 1), thus indicating that chicken products in retail at the
study area pose risk to human consumers. Lower S. aureus
counts of 2.74 – 0.56 log CFU/gram were reported from breast
ﬁllet in Croatia (Kozacinski et al. 2006) and >103 in ready-to-
eat chicken meat in South Africa (Oguttu et al. 2014), while, in
The Netherlands, colony counts in chicken meat products
were found below 10 CFU/gram (de Boer et al. 2009).

The emergence of antimicrobial-resistant S. aureus has
been associated with the uncontrolled use of drugs such as
growth promoters in animals; hence, there should be a re-
striction of usage at the farm level (Huber et al. 2010,
Buyukcangaz et al. 2013). In the present study, 64.6% and
60.4% of the isolates were resistant to doxycycline and
amoxicillin (Table 2). In accordance with these results, S.
aureus isolates have shown increased resistance to tetracy-
clines and penicillins in different studies (Aydin et al. 2011,
Pu et al. 2011, Buyukcangaz et al. 2013). The spread of
penicillin resistance has been found to be rapid due to plas-
mid transfer and is most reported among isolates of food
origin (Aydin et al. 2011, Buyukcangaz et al. 2013). S. aureus
isolates of human origin were signiﬁcantly more resistant to
1 = 5.34,
cefoperazone than isolates of chicken origin (v1
p = 0.02). The higher resistance of human isolates could be
attributed to the common use of cefoperazone in treatment of
dairy cattle infected with mastitis, which consequently results
in more exposure of human consumers to resistant S. aureus
from dairy sources (Fessler et al. 2014). Interestingly, all
S. aureus isolates in the present study were sensitive to

vancomycin, thus concurring with previously reported results
(Buyukcangaz et al. 2013, Cho et al. 2014, Kim et al. 2015).
Characterization of some virulence-associated genes was
essential to investigate the potential of the isolates to pose
risk to human consumers. Of 48 S. aureus isolates, the PVL-
associated gene was found in 31.3%, whereas 90% of MRSA
isolates were PVL positive (Table 3). In agreement with the
current study, all MRSA isolates from retail meat were PVL
positive in the United States (Pu et al. 2009, Bhargava et al.
2011), whereas 37.2% of S. aureus isolates from clinical
cases were positive for PVL (Lina et al. 1999). In Egypt,
19.04% PVL positive MRSA isolates were characterized
from patients at Zagazig City, Egypt (Enany et al. 2010).
Other studies reported that MRSA isolates from retail meat
were negative for the PVL-associated gene (Fessler et al.
2011, Hanson et al. 2011, Ogata et al. 2012). The signiﬁcance
of PVL-positive MRSA isolates was associated with their
ability to produce skin infections and pneumonia (Liassine
et al. 2004, Labandeira-Rey et al. 2007).

Although c-hemolysin previously was reported to be pro-
duced by more than 99% of S. aureus (Prevost et al. 1995),
only two isolates were positive in the present study (Table 3).
Likewise, Li et al. (2015) reported that none of the S. aureus
isolates from retail foods in China were positive for the hlg
gene. Contrary to our results, c-hemolysin–associated gene
was detected in all MRSA isolates from human cases (Lina
et al. 1999).

S. aureus isolates of poultry origin mainly produce toxins
C and D; however, production of toxins A and B was reported
recently in isolates from raw chicken meat (Kitai et al. 2005).
In the present study, 10.4% of S. aureus isolates were positive
for both sea- and sed-associated genes (Table 3). In Japan,
Kitai et al. (2005) reported that 78 S. aureus isolates were
enterotoxigenic, of which, 17.9% and 2.6% were found to
produce SEA and SED, respectively. Enterotoxins were re-
ported also in 29.5% of S. aureus isolated from meat and meat
products in China ( Jiang et al. 2001).

In the present study, 40% and 30% of MRSA isolates were
found to harbor sea and sed genes, respectively (Table 3).
Similarly, Corrente et al. (2005) reported that 71 MRSA
isolates of human origin in Italy were able to synthesize SEA,
whereas, in contrast, SED was the most frequently synthe-
sized toxin among MRSA isolates from foods of animal or-
igin in Italy (Normanno et al. 2007). Most of MRSA isolates
(60%) were shown to harbor more than one of the investi-
gated virulence factors, whereas only two non-MRSA iso-
lates showed the simultaneous presence of two virulence
determinants. These results indicate that MRSA isolates pose
more risk to human consumers compared to non-MRSA
isolates (Kim et al. 2015).

The spa gene encoding for protein A was chosen for typing
the isolates in the current study on the basis of the previously
reported heterogeneous nature indicating variability among
the examined strains (Wichelhaus et al. 2001). The results
obtained showed that a single band of 1200 bp was produced
by 80% of MRSA isolates, whereas 20% of the strains had no
bands (Fig. 1). These results were consistent with Omar et al.
(2014), who reported that PCR-RFLP of the spa gene pro-
duced a single band (type S1) in 84% of MRSA isolates; 5.2%
were of type S4 that had no PCR products. Moreover, the
authors reported the same banding patterns after restriction
and 92% typeability of the method. The absence of the spa

gene was also reported in 3.8% (Shakeri et al. 2010) and 5%
(Adesida et al. 2006) of S. aureus isolates. These observa-
tions were supported by the speculation that the spa gene is
not consistently expressed in all S. aureus isolates (Fre´nay
et al. 1994).

The isolation of S. aureus with long spa bands (1200–
1392 bp) has been reported to have a role in adherence to
respiratory epithelium (Omar et al. 2014). The current study
reports that spa bands from MRSA isolates of human and
chicken meat origin are long enough (1200 bp) to adhere to
respiratory epithelium in case of infection. In accordance,
different studies have also reported the ampliﬁcation of the
spa gene in S. aureus producing long amplicons (Mehndiratta
et al. 2009, Shakeri et al. 2010, Soltan Dallal et al. 2010). Two
bands of 240 bp and 696 bp were produced by all MRSA
isolates after restriction (Fig. 1). The identical restriction
banding pattern of MRSA isolates of human and chicken
meat origin indicated the genetic relatedness of the isolates.
Interestingly,
the seven
MRSA isolates were from the shops where MRSA-positive
vendors were identiﬁed. Such ﬁndings highlighted the pos-
sibility of MRSA transmission between meat handlers and
chicken meat. The potential of contaminated meat con-
sumption to produce risk for S. aureus infection to consumers
was suggested by Ogata et al. (2012), who identiﬁed identical
genetic ﬁngerprint between S. aureus isolates of human and

related to animal and human isolates in Korea (Lee 2003).

the current results showed that

Conclusion

Although there was a low isolation rate of MRSA from the
chicken products examined, this rate could present a risk to
consumers. To minimize the spread of MRSA by contami-
nated raw foods, handlers should follow appropriate hygienic
measures during the handling and preparation of food.
Moreover, knowledge about the sources, mode of transmis-
sion, and prevention tools is required. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to characterize PVL-positive
MRSA from chicken products and to use spa-RFLP for
evaluating the genetic relatedness between MRSA of human
and chicken origin in Egypt.
