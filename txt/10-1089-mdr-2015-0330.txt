The present investigation was carried out to study the vancomycin resistance pattern of Staphylococcus aureus
isolates (n = 274) obtained from 352 milk samples of bovine (269) and caprine (63) clinical and subclinical
mastitis from different districts of West Bengal, India. Of them, seven isolates (vancomycin-resistant S. aureus
[VRSA] 1–7) exhibited resistance to vancomycin. Minimum inhibitory concentration of vancomycin (MICvan)
for VRSA2 and VRSA3 was ‡16 mg/ml; thus categorized as VRSA. For rest of the isolates, MICvan was 8 mg/ml
and they were grouped as vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA). Even though all the isolates were
resistant to cefoxitin and oxacillin and possessed mecA gene, none of them carried vancomycin resistance gene.
Furthermore, all the seven isolates were subjected to Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec)
typing, Staphylococcal protein A (spa) typing, and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus polymerase
chain reaction. All the isolates except VRSA3 and VRSA4 from Kolkata district exhibited diverse genetic
lineage, irrespective of their host and antibiotic resistance pattern. These two isolates showed clonal similarity
(MRSA-SCCmec-V-spa t267) with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains previously reported in
human and animal infection. Isolation of VRSA and VISA could probably be due to intensive use of vanco-
mycin in healthcare premises, which might have led to the development of glycopeptide-resistant strains and
thereafter, further disseminated in the environment, including livestock farms. Detection of VRSA in milk is a
serious concern as it may further cause health problems in the consumers. This is the ﬁrst ever report of VRSA
in food animals, even though the pathogen is otherwise prevalent in humans.

Introduction

S taphylococcus aureus is responsible for a wide

spectrum of diseases, including pyoderma, osteomyelitis,
endocarditis, septicemia, surgical wound complications,
pneumonia in human beings, and mastitis in diary animals.1,2
With the emergence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)
and its increasing resistance to antibiotics of various groups
such as penicillins, cephalosporins, ﬂuoroquinolones, ami-
noglycosides and macrolides, vancomycin has been the anti-
biotic of the last resort to treat the hospitalized patients
critically infected with MRSA or other Gram-positive organ-
isms like Clostridium difﬁcile.3,4

Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic, which acts
against Gram-positive bacteria by inhibition of cell wall
synthesis. However, intensive use of vancomycin over the
years in healthcare premises has eventually led to the devel-

opment of glycopeptide-resistant strains of S. aureus. After
its ﬁrst report during 1997 in Japan, vancomycin-resistant
S. aureus (VRSA) and vancomycin intermediate S. aureus
(VISA) were reported from various countries,
including
United States,5 United Kingdom,6,7 Germany,8 Portugal,9
Brazil,10 China,11 Bangladesh,12 and Jordan.13 Most of these
reports were concerned with hospitalized human patients with
preexisting MRSA infection.

In contrast, there is hardly any report available on the oc-
currence of VRSA in animals possibly due to the fact that
glycopeptides are not regularly used in veterinary practices.
Nevertheless, contamination of the environment or pasture
land situated in and around the human healthcare premises
with VRSA and its further colonization in the domestic ani-
mals cannot be ruled out. In recent past, VRSA isolates of farm
animal origin have been reported from South Africa.14 Again,
this group of workers have reported reduced vancomycin

susceptibility of MRSA and methicillin-resistant Staphylo-
coccus epidermidis (MRSE) isolates from bovine mastitis.15
At the same time, reports on the occurrence of VRSA in hos-
pitalized human patients from different parts of India are on the
rise over the last few years.16–20 To test our hypothesis that
these pathogens might enter the livestock population, we in-
vestigated the VRSA isolates obtained from milk samples of
clinical and subclinical bovine and caprine mastitis from dif-
ferent districts of West Bengal, India.

Materials and Methods

Bacterial isolates

A total of 352 milk samples were collected from bovine
(269) and caprine (83) clinical and subclinical mastitis dur-
ing 2012 to 2015 from different districts of West Bengal,
India. From affected quarter of the udder, milk or secretions
were collected. If more than one quarter was affected, pooled
samples were considered for the study. The samples were
transported in the laboratory maintaining cold chain. In the
laboratory, 10 ml of each sample was incubated overnight in
trypticase soy broth (BD, BBL) at 37°C and inoculated in
Baird Parker agar (BD, BBL) with egg yolk emulsion and
mannitol salt agar (MSA; HiMedia). Colonies surrounded by
bright yellow zone in MSA or black, shiny, and convex col-
onies surrounded by a clear zone in Baird Parker agar were
primarily selected as Staphylococcus. Single-isolated colo-
nies were taken in nutrient agar (HiMedia) slant and were
further processed for conﬁrmation as S. aureus using standard
tests such as Gram’s staining, catalase, coagulase, oxidase,
indole, methyl red, urease, Voges–Proskauer, lecithinase pro-
duction, mannitol, and glucose fermentation.21 Out of 352 milk
samples, 216 were found positive for S. aureus. Finally, 274
colonies were conﬁrmed as S. aureus encompassing single
colony from 168 milk samples and two colonies from 48 milk
samples. Furthermore, all the 274 isolates were conﬁrmed by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection of 16S ri-
bosomal RNA, thermonuclease (nuc), Staphylococcal protein
A (spa), details of which is described later. Of the 274 S. aureus
isolates, 211 isolates were obtained from bovine and 63 from
caprine milk.

Isolation of VRSA

For isolation of VRSA, we followed three step procedure.
First, all the S. aureus isolates were inoculated in Mueller
Hinton Agar (MHA; HiMedia) containing 2.0 mg/L vanco-
mycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated at 35°C for 48 hours.
Further, minimum inhibitory concentration of vancomycin
(MICvan) for all the isolates that grew on vancomycin sup-
plemented MHA plates was determined using both Ezy MIC
paper strips (HiMedia) coated with vancomycin (0.016–
256 mg/ml) and agar dilution method.

For MIC determination using Ezy MIC paper strips,
colonies were picked up after overnight incubation on nu-
trient agar plate to prepare suspension of 0.5 McFarland
standards in sterile normal saline and inoculated on MHA.
Finally, Ezy MIC paper strips were placed on the inoculated
plates and incubated at 35°C for 24 hours. MIC was read
where the ellipse intersected the MIC scale on the strip. In
agar dilution method, MHA was prepared with vancomycin
hydrochloride (0.5–256 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) and spotted

with the isolates. Following 24 hours incubation at 35°C, the
plates were checked for any visible growth. For all the
isolates, the test was repeated thrice in duplicate. In agar
dilution method, gradient plates of S. aureus ATCC 29213
strain were used as vancomycin susceptible control.

Based on the results, isolates with MICvan values ‡16 mg/ml
were classiﬁed as VRSA, whereas the isolates with MICvan in
the range of 4–8 mg/ml were termed as VISA.22 For further
conﬁrmation, the isolates showing vancomycin resistance
(‡8 mg/ml) were checked for their growth in vancomycin
screen agar (containing 6.0 mg/L vancomycin; BDL Difco).

Determination of methicillin/oxacillin resistance

All the S. aureus isolates exhibiting resistance to vanco-
mycin were inoculated into MeReSa Agar Base (containing
cefoxitin 6.0 mg/L and methicillin 4.0 mg/L; HiMedia) and
methicillin–oxacillin screen agar (containing oxacillin 2.0
mg/L and polymyxin B 50,000 IU/L; HiMedia) and incu-
bated at 35°C for 24 hours as per instructions of the man-
ufacturer. Any visible growth in the respective medium
indicated the isolates as methicillin/oxacillin resistant. Fur-
thermore, MIC of oxacillin (MICoxa) and MIC of cefoxitin
(MICcef) for all these isolates were measured by Ezy MIC pa-
per strips (HiMedia) coated with oxacillin (0.016–256 mg/ml)
following the guidelines of the manufacturer. MICoxa and
MICcef were also conﬁrmed for all the VRSA and VISA
isolates following agar dilution method using the MHA
plates supplemented with oxacillin sodium salt monohydrate
and MHA plates supplemented with cefoxitin sodium salt
(0.5–256 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). The S. aureus isolates with
MICoxa ‡4 mg/ml and MICcef ‡8 mg/ml were categorized as
methicillin/oxacillin resistant.

Antibiotic susceptibility testing

The isolates exhibiting resistance to vancomycin were
further checked for their drug resistance proﬁle by disc agar
diffusion technique using commercially available discs (Hi-
Media) against the following antibiotics—amoxyclav (30/10
mg), amikacin (30 mg), co-trimoxazole (25 mg), clindamycin
(2 mg), ciproﬂoxacin (5 mg), gatiﬂoxacin (5 mg), tobramycin
(10 mg), polymyxin B (300 U), levoﬂoxacin (5 mg), tetracycline
(15 mg), cefpodoxime (10 mg), ceftazidime (30 mg), ceftriax-
one (30 mg), cefepime (30 mg), and piperacillin+tazobactam
(100/10 mg). MHA plates were streaked with 0.5 McFarland
standard inoculum of the puriﬁed isolates, and the zone of
inhibition was measured after incubation with antibiotic discs
at 37°C for 18–24 hours following CLSI guidelines.22

PCR-based screening of the VRSA

Bacterial DNA was isolated from all the S. aureus isolates
resistant to vancomycin using the commercially available
QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN). All the oligonucleotide
primers were procured from Metabion, Germany, and the
reagents for PCR were procured from QIAGEN and Fer-
mentas. The PCR ampliﬁcation of 16s rDNA, spa, nuc, mecA,
mecC, VanA, and VanB was performed in Veriti 96-Well
Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystem) in 25 ml of reaction
volume consisting of 2.5 mM MgCl2, 200 mM of each dNTPs,
10 pmol of each primer, and 1 U of Taq polymerase as per
the cycle conditions described earlier.20,23–26 The ampliﬁed

products obtained were visualized by the gel documentation
system (UV Mini Bis Bio-imaging System) after electro-
phoresis in 2% (W/V) agarose gel containing ethidium bro-
mide (0.5 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich).

Cloning and sequencing

Ampliﬁed mecA, nuc, and spa genes were puriﬁed using
the gel puriﬁcation kit (Fermentas) and cloned in pGEM-T
Easy Vector (Promega) following standard protocol. The
plasmids containing the expected insert were sequenced using
the BigDye Terminator
v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied
Biosystems, Inc.) in an automated sequencer (Applied Bio-
systems 3130 Genetic Analyzer) following the manufactur-
er’s instructions. After obtaining the sequencing results,
homology searches were conducted using the BLAST algo-
rithm available at http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi.

Ò

Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-PCR

All the S. aureus isolates resistant to vancomycin were
subjected to enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-
PCR (ERIC-PCR) in 50 ml reaction volume containing 50 pmol
of each primer, 400 mM of each dNTPs, 2 U of Taq polymerase,
5 ml of 10· PCR buffer, and 1.5 mM MgCl2. Following initial
denaturation at 95°C for 10 minutes, Taq polymerase was
added to the reaction mixture and PCR was conducted with 35
cycles consisting of 95°C for 1.5 minutes, 55°C for 2.0 min-
utes, and 72°C for 10 minutes with a ﬁnal extension for 20
minutes at 72°C.27 The ampliﬁed product was visualized as
described earlier. For interpretation of ERIC-PCR data, all the
images taken by the gel documentation system were analyzed
using the Doc-itLS Image Analysis Software supplied with the
system (UVP) as per manufacturer’s instruction. Phylogenetic
relationship among the isolates was established comparing the
differences in the banding pattern to determine the degree of
genetic divergence and similarity among the VRSA isolates.

Staphylococcal cassette chromosome
mec and spa typing

All the VRSA isolates, which showed oxacillin and cefox-
itin resistance, were subjected to multiplex PCR for subtyping
of Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) as
described previously.28 The polymorphic X region of the spa
of all the VRSA/VISA isolates was ampliﬁed, and the am-
plicons were cloned and sequenced as described earlier.29 The
sequencing information was submitted in the online software
http://spatyper.fortinbras.us/ for obtaining the spa types.

Results

Out of 352 milk samples collected, 216 samples (61.36%)
were found positive for S. aureus. All the 274 S. aureus
isolates were mannitol fermenting, positive in tube coagu-
lase test, and produced brown black colonies with opales-
cence in Baird Parker agar. All the S. aureus isolates were
also positive for 16S rDNA and nuc gene by PCR.

Of these, seven isolates exhibited resistance to vanco-
mycin as revealed by Ezy MIC test strip and agar dilution
method. Amongst these, two isolates were from milk sam-
ples of goat and ﬁve were of bovine milk origin obtained
from ﬁve different districts of West Bengal, India (Table 1).
All the VRSA isolates were obtained from different animals.

The S. aureus isolates (VRSA2 and VRSA3) detected with
MICvan values of 16 and 32 mg/ml were classiﬁed as VRSA.
For rest of the isolates (VRSA1, VRSA4, VRSA5, VRSA6, and
VRSA7), the MICvan value was 8 mg/ml (Table 1). These were
accordingly classiﬁed as VISA as per CLSI breakpoints.22
Furthermore, all the isolates were methicillin resistant as they
were resistant to oxacillin and cefoxitin as revealed by MICoxa
and MIC cef values (Table 1). For two isolates (VRSA2 and
VRSA6), MICoxa was more than 256 mg/ml. It is interesting to
note that both the VRSA isolates (VRSA2 and VRSA3) ex-
hibited high MIC values (64 and 256 mg/ml) for both oxacillin
and cefoxitin (Table 1).

All the seven VRSA and VISA isolates were phenotypi-
cally resistant to oxacillin and methicillin and carried mecA
gene as well. BLAST search with the ampliﬁed mecA gene
revealed 100% homology with several sequences avail-
able in the database. The sequences were submitted to Gen-
Bank (Accession nos. KF895401.1, KJ872636, KT824865,
KT824863). The mecA variant (mecC) was not detected in
any of the isolates. Furthermore, all the isolates were nega-
tive by PCR for vanA and vanB genes despite being pheno-
typically resistant to vancomycin.

including—all

The VRSA and VISA isolates exhibited resistance to
various antibiotics tested,
the beta-lactam
compounds (cefpodoxime, cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriax-
one, piperacillin/tazobactam, and clavulanic acid potentiated
amoxycillin), co-trimoxazole, polymyxin B, and clindamycin.
However, most of the isolates were sensitive to amikacin,
tobramycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, levoﬂoxacin, ci-
proﬂoxacin, and gatiﬂoxacin indicating the efﬁcacy of
ﬂuoroquinolones and aminoglycosides against VRSA and
VISA isolated from animals (Table 1).

All the VRSA and VISA isolates were subjected to ERIC-
PCR, SCCmec, and spa typing to determine the clonal diversity
and phylogenetic relationship among them. The isolates pro-
duced ampliﬁed products ranging from 166 to 3,342 bp in
ERIC-PCR and were grouped into four major clusters namely
A–D (Table 1). In spa typing, ﬁve isolates belonged to four spa
types—t267, t527, t800, and t3626, whereas two isolates were
nontypeable (Table 1: KT824864, KT803047, KT803046,
KT824862, and KT764111). Of the seven isolates, three could
not be typed by SCCmec typing, whereas three belonged to
SCCmec type V (VRSA2, VRSA3, and VRSA4) and one iso-
late to type IV (VRSA7).

Although no speciﬁc ERIC-based cluster was observed
according to the genotype or antibiotic resistance pattern of
the isolates, VRSA strains isolated from mastitic cows of
Kolkata district (VRSA3 and VRSA4) were clustered together
in clad-B along with an isolate from Nadia district (VRSA1).
Interestingly, both the isolates—VRSA3 and VRSA4 be-
longed to spa t267.

Discussion

In India, reports on occurrence of VRSA in humans, espe-
cially in the patients from intensive care unit or with prolonged
MRSA infection and vancomycin therapy, are emerg-
ing.16,17,20,30 However, occurrence of vancomycin-resistant
MRSA strains is rarely reported in animals, as it is not used
in veterinary practice in many countries, including India.
Furthermore,
there is no report available from India to
the present ﬁndings of vancomycin resistance
support

679

among S. aureus in animals, barring a single report from this
group of workers on reduced susceptibility of S. aureus and
S. epidermidis isolates towards vancomycin.15 Development
of such resistance could probably be due to contamination of
pasture land or environment with the vancomycin-resistant
isolates originated from human patients residing in close
proximity. In general, milching of animal is mostly practised
manually in all these areas and it may have substantially
increased the possibility of infection or transfer of pathogens
from the milkman to cows as recorded by other workers.31
Added to this, presence of VRSA and MRSA in human
population in this zone has also been previously docu-
mented.18 Recent reports suggested that hospital-associated
discharge/efﬂuent is a convenient vehicle for dissemination of
antibiotic resistance in MRSA and VRSA strains.32 Further-
more, it is also possible that use of other cell wall acting
antimicrobials may lead to vancomycin resistance in MRSA
strains due to alteration of cell wall structure.33,34

In the present study, all the VRSA and VISA isolates
were found resistant to several antibiotics of various groups
like penicillin, third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins,
clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, and glycopeptides, which are
in corroboration with earlier reports.18–20 Furthermore, all
these isolates harbored mecA gene encoding for modiﬁed
penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a). Probably because of this,
these isolates were frequently resistant to beta-lactam drugs. In
contrast, most of the isolates in the present study were sensitive
to ﬂuoroquinolones (ciproﬂoxacin, gatiﬂoxacin, and levo-
ﬂoxacin) and aminoglycosides (amikacin and tobramycin).
This is in contrast to the ﬁnding of earlier workers who reported
that VRSA isolates of human origin from northern India were
resistant
tobramycin,
norﬂoxacin, and ciproﬂoxacin.20 This could possibly be due to
the fact that previous exposure to such antibiotics might have
led to selection of ﬂuoroquinolone- or aminoglycoside-resistant
strains. However, sensitivity of the VRSA/VISA isolates to
tetracycline as recorded in the present study was also previously
noted by a group of workers from Hyderabad, India.19

to amikacin, netilmicin, gentamicin,

Of all the VRSA and VISA isolated in the present study,
none was positive for vanA and vanB gene. Adegoke and
Okoh could not detect vanA and vanB genes in VRSA iso-
lates from animals.14 Likewise, Tiwari and Sen also could
not detect van cluster in the VRSA isolates.20 Possession of
van gene is not essential for vancomycin resistance as it can
also be associated with increased cell wall thickness with
more layers of peptidoglycans and murein monomers in the
bacterial cell wall.35 However, increased cell wall thickness
or modiﬁed peptidoglycan synthesis is mostly reported for
low level of vancomycin resistance in S. aureus isolates.
Contrary to this, two isolates (VRSA3 and VRSA4) in the
present study exhibited MICvan of 16 and 32 mg/ml and such
resistance in human isolates was mostly reported as a result
of acquisition of van cluster.10,18,19,30 Besides, there is also
possibility of some other resistance mechanisms instru-
mental for the emergence of VRSA in animals.

In this study, all the VRSA and VISA isolates resistant
to methicillin/oxacillin also carried mecA gene in PCR. Of
them, four isolates (VRSA1, VRSA2, VRSA3, and VRSA6)
exhibited high degree of resistance to oxacillin with an
MICoxa of 64 or >256 mg/ml indicating overexpression of
mecA or hyperproduction of modiﬁed PBP2a, which might
have led to the development of vancomycin resistance in

these isolates.36 Various factors are known to inﬂuence anti-
biotic susceptibility pattern or MIC level when tested in vitro,
such as bacterial inoculum, pH of the media, moisture, thy-
midine, or thiamine concentration. Even, certain divalent
cations or metals are also known to antagonize some anti-
microbials resulting in higher MIC levels.37 However, very
high levels of resistance to vancomycin, oxacillin, and ce-
foxitin as recorded in the present study are very unlikely to
be inﬂuenced by such factors.

Although the VRSA and VISA isolates characterized with
ERIC-PCR produced different band patterns, no distinct
pattern or similarity in ERIC proﬁle was noticed among them
based on the criteria of animal species, antibiotic resistance
pattern, or genotype. This is in contradiction with earlier
ﬁndings of Ye et al. who reported a clear correlation between
ERIC-PCR and resistance patterns in some strains.27 In this
study, two caprine isolates namely VRSA2 and VRSA7 were
clustered together by ERIC-PCR. However, they belonged to
two different spa types (Table 1). Interestingly, isolates
VRSA3 and VRSA4 obtained from bovine milk from Kolkata
district and clustered together by ERIC-PCR were also typed
as t267 by spa typing. This indicates that these isolates were
from the single-genetic lineage. This spa type (t267) was
previously reported in VRSA isolates from bovine milk in
China38 and Japan.39 Other than t267, the isolates namely
VRSA2, VRSA5, and VRSA6 belonged to t527, t800, and
t3626 types, respectively, whereas two isolates (VRSA1 and
VRSA7) were nontypeable. The S. aureus spa type t800 was
previously reported from ICU patients of the Netherlands,40
UAE, and several other European countries. The other two
types—t527 and t3626 were most infrequently reported from
Finland, Croatia, and Iran (http://spa.ridom.de/frequencies
.shtml). Three isolates (VRSA2, VRSA3, and VRSA4) of the
present study were found to carry SCCmec type V and one
isolate (VRSA7) from goat milk carried SCCmec type IV. The
SCCmec type V was mostly reported as a novel gene cassette
in community-associated MRSA strains. Likewise, SCCmec
type IV is also community acquired SCCmec type detected in
MRSA strains. Both the types (IV and V) were previously
reported in bovine methicillin-resistant non-S. aureus.41
Again, workers from Finland have also reported both SCCmec
type IV and type V in MRSA and MRSE isolates from bovine
mastitis.42 Of the three isolates with SCCmec type V strains,
two isolates were with spa type t267. MRSA strains with such
genetic lineage of MRSA-SCCmecV-spa t267 were recently
reported from bovine mastitis in China.38 Although MRSA
isolates with such genetic background are also recorded from
human patients,43 this kind of genetic characteristics has not
been reported in VRSA and VISA strains till date. Never-
theless, the available reports indicate that isolates with such
genetic background may cause infection both in animals, as
well as human beings.

This is the ﬁrst ever report of VRSA in food animals,
especially in India, where the pathogen is otherwise preva-
lent in human. Isolation and detection of MRSA in goat milk
is a cause of concern, as this was not previously detected
and reported.
