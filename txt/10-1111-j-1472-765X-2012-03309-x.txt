Signiﬁcance and Impact of the Study: This study is the ﬁrst detailed documentation of a high occurence
of extended-spectrum b-lactamases and plasmidic cephalosporinases in E. coli at the poultry farm level
in Tunisia. Moreover, this is the ﬁrst description of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) in
Tunisian animals. This study highlights that Tunisian poultry are a reservoir of antibiotic resistance
genes which may be transferred to humans.

Abstract

We characterized 67 Escherichia coli isolates with reduced susceptibility to cefo-
taxime obtained from 136 samples of healthy broilers housed in 36 Tunisian
farms. All these isolates harboured blaCTX-M-1 and ⁄ or blaCMY-2 genes located
mostly on self-conjugative IncI1 plasmids. qnrS1, qnrA6 and aac(6¢)-Ib-cr were
detected in six isolates. Considerable genetic diversity was detected among iso-
lates from different farms. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst detailed docu-
mentation of a high occurrence of blaCTX-M-1 and blaCMY-2 in E. coli at the
poultry farm level in Tunisia as well as the ﬁrst description of plasmid-medi-
ated quinolone resistance in food animals in Tunisia which may contribute to
the dissemination of these genes throughout Tunisia.

Introduction

Since the beginning of the 1990s, the increase in the prev-
alence of extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs) among
clinical Escherichia coli isolates in human medicine have
been a cause of great concern. The earliest ESBLs, TEM-1,
TEM-2 and SHV-1 derivatives were detected mostly in
hospital-acquired pathogens. However, recently, CTX-M
enzymes have taken over as the main ESBL type and
had spread across the world, particularly in both hospital
and community Escherichia coli
(Pitout and
Laupland 2008; Canto´ n et al. 2012). Plasmidic class C
beta-lactamase (AmpC) have also taken their entry and
CMY-2 appears
to be the most commonly detected
AmpC beta-lactamse found in E. coli causing human
infections (Doi et al. 2010). Different reports have alerted
the dissemination of
in the
ESBL ⁄ AmpC-producing E. coli
in healthy food-producing
animals in different countries (Girlich et al. 2007; Smet
et al. 2010; Randall et al. 2011; Zheng et al. 2012). Previous
studies carried out in Tunisia reported the presence of

about

different ESBLs in food products but not in farm animals
(Jouini et al. 2007; Ben Slama et al. 2010). The diversity
and prevalence of ESBL and plasmidic AmpC among E. coli
at the poultry farm level in Tunisia are still unknown.

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the faecal
carriage of plasmidic AmpC- and ESBL-producing E. coli
in broilers from different Tunisian farms and to detect
the presence of other antimicrobial resistance markers in
these bacteria.

Results and discussion

A total of 67 cefotaxime (CTX)-resistant E. coli were
recovered from 57 of
the 136 chicken faecal samples
(42%) and from 24 of the 36 investigated farms (66%).
The double-disc synergy test revealed synergy between
clavulanate and cefotaxime or
ceftazidime-containing
discs for 43 isolates from 41 samples, suggesting produc-
tion of an ESBL in 30% of the samples. The 24 remaining
CTX-resistant isolates had an AmpC-phenotype. All the
67 CTX-resistant E. coli isolates were multidrug-resistant

and showed resistance to more than two non-beta-lactam
antibiotics,
including tetracycline (94%), nalidixic acid
(89Æ5%), norﬂoxacin (71Æ6%), trimethoprim–sulfamethox-
azole (73Æ1%), gentamicin (6%), amikacin (6%). All the
isolates were susceptible to imipenem.

All ESBLs belonged to CTX-M group 1: 39 CTX-M-1
and 4 CTX-M-15. All isolates with AmpC phenotype har-
boured the blaCMY-2 gene. Only one isolate carried
blaCTX-M-1 and blaCMY-2 genes. blaTEM-1 was detected in
26 isolates (38Æ8%). QnrS1 was detected in 2 CTX-M1
producing E. coli and QnrB5 in one CMY-2 isolate and
the aac(6¢)-Ib-cr gene in 2 CTX-M-15 and one CTX-M-1
producing isolates.

The determination of the phylogenetic group of the
ESC resistant E. coli revealed that group A was dominant
(34, 50Æ7%) followed by group D (21, 31Æ3%) and group
B1 (11, 16Æ4%). Only one isolate belonged to group B2
and did not belong to clone O25b-ST131. Clonal relation-
ships among the E. coli isolate within each farm assessed
by ERIC genotyping revealed that clonality within the
same farm was often observed (18 cases, Table 1). One
isolate per ERIC proﬁle was selected for further studies.
Consequently, a total of 44 nonrepetitive isolates (27
ESBL and 17 AmpC) were included in the following
experiments
(Table 1). Pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis
analysis of XbaI-digested genomic DNA revealed a high
diversity among the 44 studied isolates as the obtained
patterns displayed less than 80% similarity (Fig. 1). Thus,
the spread of the blaCTX-M-1 and blaCMY-2 did not result
from the dissemination of a single clone. In fact, there
were no common clones between farms except for two
cases where we have identiﬁed the same clones between
farms belonging to different governorates (Fig. 1).

Resistance to ESCs was transferred from 29 of the 44
selected isolates (66%) by conjugation for 26 isolates
(59%) and by transformation for three isolates. blaCTX-M-1
genes were transferred to recipient by conjugation for
14 of 27 isolates (51%) and by transformation for three
isolates. blaCMY-2 genes were transferred from 12 of 17
(70%) isolates by conjugation. Depending on the strain,
other resistances were cotransferred, mostly tetracycline
(55%) and rarely trimethoprim–sulphamethoxazole (8%;
Table 1). Quinolone resistance was not cotransferred in
any case. blaTEM-1 was cotransferred with blaCMY-2 in two
strains and with blaCTX-M-1 in one strain (Table 1). PCR-
based replicon typing of the major plasmid incompatibil-
ity group showed that all blaCTX-M-1 and eight blaCMY-2
carrying plasmids belonged to the IncI1 incompatibility
group, and four blaCMY-2 genes were located on IncK
plasmids (4). None blaCTX-M-1 or blaCMY-2 gene was
located on incF plasmid. However, PCR-based replicon
typing of the total plasmid content of the parental strains
showed that most strains contained an IncF-type plasmid

(31 of 44 strains; Table 1), consistent with other reports
(Pitout and Laupland 2008; Randall et al. 2011; Zheng
et al. 2012). All but 7 of the 44 donor strains contained
multiple plasmids (Table 1).

Since their ﬁrst description in 1989, different studies
have reported the dissemination of CTX-M E. coli isolates
among the intestinal ﬂora of healthy humans, as well as
of
food-producing animals and also in food products
(Pitout and Laupland 2008; Doi et al. 2010; Smet et al.
2010; Canto´ n et al. 2012). blaCTX-M-1 is the ESBL encod-
ing gene mostly detected in poultry especially in France,
Great Britain, Belgium and Portugal (Girlich et al. 2007;
Pitout and Laupland 2008; Doi et al. 2010; Smet et al.
2010; Randall et al. 2011; Zheng et al. 2012). However, a
wide range of additional blaCTX-M subtypes (blaCTX-M-2,
blaCTX-M-3, blaCTX-M-8, blaCTX-M-9, blaCTX-M-14, blaCTX-M-15,
blaCTX-M-17 ⁄ 18, blaCTX-M-20, blaCTX-M-32, blaCTX-M-53) have
been detected in food-producing animals and food world-
wide (Girlich et al. 2007; Pitout and Laupland 2008; Doi
et al. 2010; Smet et al. 2010; Randall et al. 2011; Zheng
et al. 2012). In Tunisia, before this study, no CTX-M
E. coli had been reported from live broiler chickens,
although they had been isolated from chicken meat and
food samples of animal origin in Tunis, including CTX-
M-1, CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-8 (Jouini et al. 2007; Ben
Slama et al. 2010). A previous study carried out by Ben
Slama et al. on E. coli isolates recovered from food sam-
ples in Tunisia during 2007 demonstrated that 26Æ9% of
chicken meat was colonized by CTX-M-1 (Jouini et al.
2007). So, the high faecal carriage rate of CTX-M-1-pro-
ducing E. coli in Tunisian poultry and contamination of
food derived from these animals may contribute to trans-
mission of blaCTX-M-1 genes, from poultry to humans in
Tunisia. In fact, recently, it was demonstrated that 7Æ3%
of Tunisian healthy humans are faecal carrier of CTX-M-1
producing E. coli (Ben Sallem et al. 2012). However,
like other studies, the most prevalent ESBL genotype in
isolates in humans in Tunisia, blaCTX-M-15, was
clinical
found only in 4 of the 67 isolates. Moreover, the distribu-
tion of poultry ESBL types found in the present study is
similar to other European countries such as France, the
Netherlands, Portugal and England where CTX-M-1 is
the dominant type and the major replicon type is Inc I1
(Girlich et al. 2007; Smet et al. 2010; Randall et al. 2011;
Zheng et al. 2012). From the current literature, the preva-
lence of IncI1 plasmids seems to be linked to a particular
reservoir of E. coli and Salmonella from poultry (Garcı´a-
Ferna´ndez et al. 2008).
IncI1 has also been recently
observed from human strains of E. coli and Salmonella
isolated in UK, German,
the Netherlands, Spain and
France and were found to be associated mainly with
CMY-2, CMY-7, CTX-M-1, CTX-M-15 and TEM-52 sug-
gesting a high prevalence of this plasmid in Europe and

blaCTX-M-1 and blaCMY-2 in Tunisian poultry

isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis
(Ktari et al. 2006; Jouini et al. 2007). The occurence of
ESBL-producing E. coli at the poultry farm level in Tuni-
sia is higher than the ﬁndings of other investigators. In a
survey of chickens in France in 2005, of the 112 faecal
samples examined, 32 (28Æ5%) yielded ESC resistant
E. coli and 12 isolates (10Æ7%) were CTX-M-1 producers
(Girlich et al. 2007). Randall et al. (2011) reported that
CTX-M-1-producing E. coli was isolated from 54Æ5% of
the United Kingdom broiler abattoirs and from 6Æ7% of
pooled broiler caecal samples. In china during 2007–2009,
14% of healthy food animals were colonized by ESC-resis-
tant E. coli and 12Æ3% were CTX-M producers (Zheng
et al. 2012). In Tunisia, we did not identify the O25b-
ST131 clone in the faecal poultry samples, which is reas-
suring at this time. However, other studies have recently
identiﬁed ST131 clone in poultry and retail meat con-
ﬁrming that this clone can colonize different hosts (Mora
et al. 2010). Moreover, Leverstein-van Hall et al. (2011)
recently reported that Dutch patients, retail chicken meat
and poultry share the same ESBL genes, plasmids and
strains, indicating transmission of ESBL genes from poul-
try to humans through the food chain.

In conclusion, in this study, a high occurrence of ESC
resistance has been detected in faecal samples of poultry
in Tunisia. This ESC resistance among a high clonal
diversity of E. coli from healthy poultry was often medi-
ated by blaCTX-M-1 and blaCMY-2 harboured by the self-
conjugative IncI1 plasmid. To our knowledge, this is the
ﬁrst detailed documentation of a high occurrence of
ESBL and plasmidic AmpC in E. coli at the poultry farm
level in Tunisia. In addition, this is the ﬁrst time that
PMQR, QnrS1, QnrB5 and Aac(6¢)-Ib-cr have been
detected in poultry in Tunisia. So, more studies should
be carried out in the future to track the origin of these
types of resistance among faecal E. coli and to analyse
the relationship between human and animal resistant
E. coli isolates.

Materials and methods

Bacterial strains and sampling

A total of 136 faecal samples of healthy chickens were
recovered from 36 farms located in six different govern-
orates of Tunisia during 4 months from February 2010 to
May 2010. On each farm, faecal samples were obtained
from different ﬂocks that contained from 2000 to 10 000
animals. Fresh dropping faecal samples were recovered
from crates. Samples were processed immediately after
collection. Samples were plated onto MacConkey-medium
)1 and incubated
supplemented with cefotaxime at 2 mg l
for 24 h at 37°C. Samples were also seeded on nonsupple-

mented medium to control faecal E. coli colonization of
chickens. Isolates that grew on the selective plates with
typical E. coli morphology were selected and identiﬁed by
classical biochemical methods. One colony per plate was
taken, except for ten samples two colonies with different
morphologies per plate were selected for further identiﬁ-
cation and studies.

according to the CLSI guidelines and interpreted accord-
ing to EUCAST criteria. ESBLs were detected using the
double-disc synergy test between clavulanic acid and ceft-
azidime, cefotaxime or cefepime.

previously established PCR-based method to identify the
O25b-ST131 clone (Clermont et al. 2009). Clonal rela-
tionships among the E. coli isolates within each farm were
assessed by studying ERIC genomic DNA proﬁles, as gen-
erated using the primer ERIC2 5¢-AAG TAA GTG ACT
GGG GTG AGC G-3¢ (Versalovic et al. 1991). Pulsed-ﬁeld
gel electrophoresis of chromosomal DNA digested with
the restriction enzyme XbaI was carried out according to
a standard protocol using a GenePath system (Bio-Rad,
Marnes-la-Coquette, France) to determine the genetic
relatedness of selected isolates (Ribot et al. 2006).

Transfer of resistance determinants and plasmid analysis

Transfer of resistance genes by conjugation was per-
formed by mating-out assays using the E. coli J53-2 Rfr
or HB101 strain as
recipients. Transconjugants were
)1) or
selected on MH agar containing rifampin (250 mg l
)1) plus ceftazidime or cefotaxime
streptomycin (50 mg l
)1). When plasmids were not transferable by con-
(2 mg l
jugation, a transformation assay was carried out. Plasmid
DNA obtained using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit
(Qiagen) was electroporated into E. coli DH10B (Invitro-
gen). Transformants were selected on MH agar plates
)1) or cefotaxime
supplemented with ceftazidime (2 mg l
)1). Plasmid replicons were determined for the
(2 mg l
parental strains and the transconjugants and transfor-
mants using the PCR-based replicon-typing scheme
described previously (Carattoli et al. 2005).
