ABSTRACT

The exposure of farm animals to antimicrobials for treatment, prophylaxis, or growth promotion can select for resistant
bacteria that can be transmitted to humans, and Salmonella as an important zoonotic pathogen can act as a potential reservoir of
antimicrobial resistance determinants. We assessed the antibiogram proﬁles of Salmonella species isolated from pig herds in two
commercial farms in South Africa. Two hundred ﬁfty-eight presumptive Salmonella isolates were recovered from the fecal
samples of 500 adult pigs. Speciﬁc primers targeting Salmonella serogroups A, B, C1, C2, and D were used to determine the
prevalence of different serogroups. Only serogroup A (n ¼ 48) was detected, while others were not. Antimicrobial susceptibility
of the conﬁrmed Salmonella serogroup A isolates was performed by using the disk diffusion method against a panel of 18
antibiotics. All the 48 isolates were resistant to tetracycline and oxytetracycline, while 75% were resistant to ampicillin,
sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim, nalidixic acid, and streptomycin. All the isolates exhibited multidrug resistance, with the
predominant phenotype being against 11 antibiotics, and multiple antibiotic resistance index ranged between 0.3 and 0.6. The
incidence of genes encoding resistance against ampicillin (ampC), tetracycline (tetA), and streptomycin (strA) were 54, 61, and
44%, respectively. We conclude that healthy pigs are potential reservoirs of multidrug-resistant Salmonella that could be
transmitted to humans through the food chain and, hence, a signiﬁcant public health threat.

The use of antimicrobials for treatment, prevention of
infections, as well as growth promotion in farm animals, is a
major contributory factor to the development of antimicro-
bial
resistance that can potentially lead to widespread
transmission of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria through the
food chain (1). Antimicrobial
resistance, as well as
multidrug resistance patterns of Salmonella and other enteric
pathogens, especially those of animal origin, have raised
concerns all over the world (4, 41). In South Africa, the
highest level of antibiotics used in animal husbandry is in
swine and poultry farms that are usually operated in
intensive systems (19). More so, organisms isolated from
pigs have been reported to be more resistant than those
recovered from other animal sources, due to a more
intensive use of antimicrobials in pigs, hence posing a
signiﬁcant public health risk to consumers (4).

Salmonella species are gram-negative ﬂagellated and
facultative intracellular pathogens causing a major global
public health concern (39, 41). Salmonella infection in pigs
is often asymptomatic and sometimes causes less severe and
transient diarrhea (32). Infections caused by Salmonella are

infections
among the most common foodborne bacterial
worldwide, with about 1.4 million cases and 600 deaths
occurring annually in the United States (28). Consumption
of contaminated foods, including pork, predisposes humans
to infection due to Salmonella (1). Most
infections in
humans are self-limiting, and antimicrobial agents might not
be necessary for treatment. However, severe forms of the
disease, such as invasive infections, may occur, therefore
requiring treatment with antibiotics (13, 16).

The Kauffman-White serotyping scheme is used in most
laboratories in characterizing Salmonella isolates in which a
serotype is determined on the basis of somatic (O) and ﬂagella
(H) antigens present
in the cell wall and ﬂagella of the
organism. The O factors determine the grouping, while the H
factors deﬁne the serotype identity of a Salmonella strain (20).
Serotyping is the most commonly used method for
phenotypic characterization and identiﬁcation of Salmonella
serogroups. Further, it is required to determine the relation-
ship between the disease and source of
infection. The
traditional method has been shown to be time-consuming,
expensive, and laborious and lacks standardized methods of
determining antisera to be used for its detection. It
is,
therefore,
imperative to integrate molecular methods to
overcome these shortcomings (30). Among the more than

2,500 serotypes of Salmonella identiﬁed, over 95% of the
strains responsible for infections in humans and animals
to E (29). For
belong to serogroups A, B, C1, C2, D,
example, Salmonella Paratyphi A, B, C, and Salmonella
Typhi belong to the serogroups A, B, C1, and D, respectively.
To our knowledge, studies showing the PCR identiﬁcation of
Salmonella serogroups obtained from swine fecal samples in
the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa are scarce.

In addition, studies have been conducted in Sub-
Saharan Africa to determine the prevalence and antimicro-
bial resistance of Salmonella in swine and other animals
(21); however, reports on antibiotic resistance in isolates
from farm animals, especially from the feces of swine in
Eastern Cape Province of South Africa are limited (19). In
this article, we report on the antibiogram characteristics of
Salmonella serogroup A isolates recovered from the feces of
healthy pigs as part of our larger study on the reservoirs of
antibiotic resistance determinants in the environment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Description of sampling sites and sample collection. The
sampling sites include two commercial farms within the Nkonkobe
Municipality in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, which is the
second largest in the province, covering approximately 3,725 km2 in
size and a rural municipality largely involved in agriculture. Fecal
samples were collected from 500 healthy adult pigs by using sterile
swab sticks. The samples were transported immediately on ice to the
Applied Environmental Microbiology Research Group laboratory at
the University of Fort Hare, South Africa, for analyses. An inventory
of the antibiotics commonly used in the farms was also taken.

Isolation of Salmonella species. Salmonella species were
isolated following the method described by Karou et al. (23), with
some modiﬁcation. Brieﬂy, samples were preenriched by inocu-
lating into tryptic soy broth and incubated at 378C for 18 to 24 h.
This was followed by adding 1 ml of preenrichment to 9 ml of
Muller-Kauffmann tetrathionate broth and incubating at 378C for
48 h. Tubes showing growth were selectively plated onto xylose
lysine desoxycholate agar (Merck, Modderfontein, Gauteng, South
Africa) and incubated aerobically at 378C for 22 to 24 h. Red
colonies with black centers were selectively picked as presumptive
Salmonella isolates and further puriﬁed on nutrient agar (Merck).

DNA extraction. The extraction of DNA from pure culture was
done by using the boiling method, as described by Maugeri et al. (31).
Brieﬂy, about 3 to 5 colonies of pure culture of the organism were
picked by using a sterile wire loop and placed into sterile DNase- and
RNase-free Eppendorf tubes (Biologix Research Co., Lenexa, KS)
containing 200 ll of sterile nuclease-free water (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc, Lafayette, CO). The suspension was vortexed, and the cells
were lysed by boiling in a heating block (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc,
Leicestershire, UK) at 1008C for 15 min. The cell debris was removed
by centrifugation using a centrifuge (Lasec-Sigma Laborzentrifugen,
Osterode, Germany) at 13,500 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant
containing the genomic DNA template was carefully transferred into
another Eppendorf tube and stored at  208C for further assays.

Identiﬁcation of Salmonella serogroups by PCR. The
presumptive isolates were screened for the different Salmonella
serogroups,
including A, B, C1, C2, and D by using a PCR
technique. Primer sets name, primer sequences, and product sizes
are listed in Table 1. Each reaction mixture consisted of 12.5 ll of

23 Dream Taq Master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Gauteng,
South Africa), 10 pmol each of the forward and reverse primers,
5 ll DNA template, and nuclease-free water (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc) to make up the ﬁnal volume to 25 ll. PCR ampliﬁcation
for all the serogroups was carried out in MyCycler Thermal Cycler
PCR system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), with an initial denaturation
of 948C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 948C for 50 s, 608C for 50 s, and
728C for 50 s, and then with a ﬁnal extension at 728C for 10 min
(30). Five-microliter aliquots of the amplicons were resolved in
1.5% agarose gel (Separations, Johannesburg, South Africa) at 100
V for 60 min. The gel, stained with ethidium bromide, was
visualized under the UV transilluminator (Alliance 4.7, UVItec,
Cambridge, UK). A 100-bp DNA ladder (Promega, San Luis
Obispo, CA) was used on each gel as a molecular weight marker.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Antimicrobial suscep-
tibility testing was performed on all conﬁrmed Salmonella serogroup
A isolates by using a disk diffusion assay, as recommended by the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guideline (8). Isolates
grown overnight in nutrient agar (Merck) at 378C were suspended in
0.85% sterile normal saline, and the cell density adjusted to a 0.5
McFarland turbidity standard. The entire surface of the Mueller-
Hinton agar was evenly spread with the standardized bacterial test
suspension, after which appropriate antibiotic discs (Mast Diagnos-
tics, Merseyside, UK) were placed on the dried surface, by using an
antibiotic disc dispenser (Mast Diagnostics). After incubation at
378C for 24 h, the results were interpreted according to the Clinical
and Laboratory Standards Institute standard (8). The panel of
tetracycline (30 lg),
antibiotics tested included the following:
oxytetracycline (30 lg), ampicillin G (10 lg), sulphamethoxazole-
trimethoprim (25 lg), streptomycin (10 lg), gentamycin (10 lg),
amikacin (30 lg), ceftazidime (30 lg), cephalothin (30 lg),
cefotaxime (30 lg), chloramphenicol (10 lg), norﬂoxacin (10 lg),
ciproﬂoxacin (5 lg), nalidixic acid (30 lg), cefuroxime (30 lg),
imipenem (10 lg), and polymycin B (300 lg). Escherichia coli
25922 was used as a quality control. The multiple antibiotic
resistance (MAR) patterns were generated for all the serogroup A
isolates following the protocol described by Ateba et al. (5).

Multiple antibiotic resistance indexing. The multiple
antibiotic resistance index (MARI) of the isolates was calculated
and interpreted according to Krumperman (27), by using the
following formula: MARI ¼ a/b, where a represents the number of
antibiotics to which a particular isolate was resistant and b the total
number of antibiotics tested. A MAR index of 0.2 indicates high-
risk environment where antibiotics are often used (36).

Detection of antibiotic resistance genes. The ampC, tetA,
and strA genes that code for resistance to ampicillin, tetracyclines,
and streptomycin,
respectively, were assessed following the
method described by Iweriebor et al. (22), using the primer
sequences described elsewhere (12, 18, 35). The same PCR
conditions were used as follows: 5-min initial denaturation at 948C,
followed by 35 cycles of 948C for 1 min, 558C for 1 min, and 728C
for 1.5-min ﬁnal incubation at 728C for 5 min.

RESULTS

Isolation and molecular serogrouping. A total of 258
presumptive isolates were recovered from 500 pig fecal
samples. They were screened for the ﬁve serogroups, and
only serogroup A was detected as 48 of the isolates (18.6%)
from farm A only. None of the other serogroups were
detected.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the Salmo-
nella group A isolates. The distribution of antimicrobial
resistance in the Salmonella group A isolates obtained in this
study is summarized in Table 1. All
the isolates were
sensitive to imipenem, whereas 91.7, 83.3, and 66.7% were
sensitive to norﬂoxacin, gentamycin, and ciproﬂoxacin,
respectively. All the isolates were resistant to erythromycin,
tetracycline, and oxytetracycline. A large proportion was
also resistant
to ampicillin (75%), sulphamethoxazole-
trimethoprim (75%), nalidixic acid (75%), and streptomycin
(75%). Furthermore, 42% of the isolates were resistant to a
third-generation cephalosporin, cefotaxime, while 25% of
the isolates showed resistance to chloramphenicol.

MAR phenotypes and MARIs. All the isolates were
resistant
to more than ﬁve antibiotics tested. The MAR
pattern of each isolate is as shown in Table 2. The highest
frequency of MAR phenotype was against 11 antibiotics and
was demonstrated by 16.7% of the isolates (n ¼ 8), whereas
4.2% (n ¼ 2) of the isolates showed the lowest frequency
against six antibiotics. The MAR indices ranged between 0.3
to 0.6.

Prevalence of resistance genes. Approximately 54, 61,
and 44% and of the resistant Salmonella serogroup A
isolates were positive for ampC, tetA, and strA resistance
genes, respectively.

DISCUSSION

In this study, molecular serogrouping of Salmonella
isolates obtained from pig fecal materials showed that only
the serogroup A was detected in about 19% of
the
presumptive isolates, while other serogroups tested were
not detected. The remaining presumptive isolates might

either belong to other serogroups not
tested or are not
Salmonella. This is in contrast with other studies in which
other serogroups were identiﬁed, although they were mainly
from clinical sources, and other animal sources, such as
poultry (6, 30), as studies that showed molecular serogroup-
ing of Salmonella isolates from swine samples are scarcely
available. The primers used in detection of serogroups in this
study were used succesfully elsewhere (30); hence,
the
variation in our results could be attributed to the sampling
source, geographical differences, or both. In addition, the
Salmonella serogroup A isolates are suspected to belong to
Salmonella Paratyphi, Salmonella Typhimurium, or both,
the most common serovars belonging to this serogroup. For
instance,
(1996 to 2006)
retrospective study on the occurrence of Salmonella in pigs
showed that the majority was due to Salmonella Typhimu-
rium (24).

From the prevalence of Salmonella obtained in this
study, it is evident that healthy pigs can be reservoirs of
Salmonella. A similar prevalence of 17.2% was reported by
Molla et al. (34) from certain swine production units in the
United States, while a relatively similar ﬁnding was
observed by Kishima et al. (26) who reported a 15.1%
(26 of 172) prevalence from the feces of pigs in Japan. On
the other hand, a lower prevalence was reported by Kikuvi
et al. (25) from a slaughterhouse in Kenya, where the
prevalence of Salmonella in fecal samples of pigs was
8.6%. A higher prevalence of 19% observed from carcass
samples suggested that environmental contamination
during slaughtering can increase the prevalence of
Salmonella in pork. Another study done elsewhere (11),
reported a prevalence of 31.5% that was higher than our
ﬁnding in this current study.

Results of antimicrobial susceptibility showed high
sensitivity of Salmonella isolates to gentamycin, which is

consistent with the ﬁndings of some authors (13, 38). This
could be attributed to its infrequent use in the farms visited.
Furthermore, low resistance to ciproﬂoxacin, which is the
drug of choice in the treatment of salmonellosis in humans,
was observed is in accordance with reports of some studies
in both developed and developing countries (9, 13). The
relatively low resistance of isolates to chloramphenicol
could probably be owing to its rare use in farms following

the ban of its use in veterinary medicine in South Africa
(17).

High frequency of resistance was observed against
tetracyclines (100%), followed by ampicillin (75%), sulpha-
methoxazole-trimethoprim (75%), and streptomycin (75%).
Similar results have been reported in other studies from
Spain (3, 13) and other parts of the world, including New
Zealand (14). Resistance to these antimicrobials is not

surprising as they are frequently used in the treatment of
infections, as well as growth promoters in animals, most
likely because of their affordability and availability in South
Africa (19, 25). Generally, all the isolates were observed to
be resistant
to more than ﬁve antibiotics. The most
predominant resistance phenotype was observed against 11
antibiotics, implying that these isolates are highy multidrug
resistant (33). Furthermore, four resistant isolates from this
study demonstrated the penta resistance pattern AMP-C-S-
typical of the Salmonella Typhimurium DT104,
T/S-T,
which has the gene-encoded resistance pattern ACSSuT
(ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulphonamides,
and tetracycline) (15, 40). This serovar has been isolated
from pigs and pork products in many countries (26) and has
become a potential threat for animal husbandry and human
medicine (10).

The MAR index observed in this study, which ranged
between 0.3 and 0.6, suggests a high level of antibiotic use
in the swine farm either for treatment or as growth promoters
in the feed, which is common in pig farms (2, 36).

their possible involvement

The ampC, tetA, and strA genes that code for resistance
to ampicillin, tetracyclines, and streptomycin, respectively,
and the commonly used drugs in the farms studied were
assessed for
in observed
phenotypic resistance. From our ﬁndings, the ampC gene
was detected in 61.1% of isolates resistant to b-lactams,
lower than the ﬁnding of Chander et al. (7) who reported 11
(92%) of 12 resistant Salmonella harboring the ampC gene.
In addition, this study showed that tetA and strA genes were
detected in 54 and 44% of resistant isolates, respectively, in
contrast with the ﬁndings of Pezzella et al. (37) in Italy who
reported the prevalence of tetA and strA genes to be 84 and
68%, respectively.

Results obtained in this study reveal that swine from
this province could harbor multidrug-resistant Salmonella
group A isolates, which could be attributed to the intensive
use of antibiotics in pig farms. This poses a signiﬁcant
public health concern and calls for strategies to reduce the
incidence of Salmonella carriage in pigs, and more stringent
policies to reduce the excessive use of clinically important
antibiotics in farms animals should be implemented in South
Africa.
