ABSTRACT. This is the first report regarding isolation of Salmonella from cecum samples of buffaloes and pigs and characterization of the
isolates in Laos.  The organisms were isolated from 8% (4/50) of buffaloes and 76% (37/49) of pigs.  In buffaloes, 3 animals harbored
serotype 9,12: –:1,5, and 1 animal harbored both S. Derby and S. Javiana.  In pigs, the most predominant serotypes were S. Derby (51%)
followed by S. Anatum (45%), S. Weltevreden (15%) and S. Stanley (5%).  The buffalo isolates were susceptible to the antimicrobials
tested, whereas the pig isolates showed 10 resistance patterns to 1–5 antibiotics.  Of the 59 pig isolates, the resistance rates to tetracycline,
streptomycin,  ampicillin,  sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim,  chloramphenicol,  amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid  and  nalidixic  acid  were  24%,
22%, 14%, 5%, 2%, 2% and 2%, respectively.  The results suggest that pigs and buffaloes harbor Salmonella, with a higher prevalence
especially in pigs, and all the isolates showed sensitivity to cefotaxime, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin.

Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica is one of the
most important foodborne bacteria in the world.  Infection
with Salmonella spp. is a major cause of diarrhea in children
and young adults in developing countries [2, 17].  The reser-
voirs of these organisms are considered to be animals, par-
ticularly chickens and pigs, and these organisms are easily
isolated from the feces [8].  The main source of infection in
humans seems to be consumption of foods from animal ori-
gin such as contaminated eggs, unpasteurized milk, cross-
contaminated foods and drinking water [5, 6, 9, 17].  In
Southeast Asian countries, Salmonella spp. are commonly
found in chicken eggs, chicken meat, and pork sold in mar-
kets [4, 8, 9, 11, 12].

In Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Laos), there are
very few reports of Salmonella in humans and livestock.
Previous reports have suggested that the prevalence of Sal-
monella in Laotians presenting with diarrhea is only 0.6%
(5/880) [16].  However, Inthavong et al. [10] reported that
the  prevalence  of  Salmonella  on  pig  carcass  swabs  at
slaughterhouses is relatively high (66.1%) and indicated that
a large amount of contaminated meat is consumed daily.
Laotians prefer to eat buffalo, pig and chicken over other
meat sources; however, there are no report available con-
cerning the prevalence of Salmonella in live animals or the
antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates from animal feces.

In the present study, we examined the prevalence of Salmo-
nella in buffaloes and pigs at a slaughterhouse in Vientiane,
Laos, and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of the
various isolates obtained.

Cecum swab samples were collected from 50 buffaloes
and 49 pigs in February 2007 at the Dorn Du slaughterhouse
in Vientiane, Laos.  The buffaloes were approximately 3–10
years of age, and were usually fed roughage (not grain).  The
pigs were approximately 8 months of age, and were bred on
personal farms.  The buffaloes were shipped to the slaugh-
terhouse from 6 livestock brokers and a few farmers, and the
pigs were from 6 livestock brokers.  We could not confirm
the number of farms from which the pigs were shipped.

Each cecum sample was collected using 2 commercial
swab sets (BD BBL Culture Swab Plus, BD, NJ, U.S.A.),
stored at 4°C and immediately transported to the microbiol-
ogy laboratory of the WHO International Salmonella & Shi-
gella Center, National Institute  of Health, Nonthaburi,
Thailand; the samples were analyzed within 30 hr of collec-
tion.  Briefly, for  isolation of Salmonella spp., each swab
sample  was  placed  in  9  ml  of  buffered  peptone  water
(Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), thoroughly mixed and then
incubated at 37°C for 18 hr. Afterwards, 1 ml of pre-enrich-
ment culture was added to 5 ml of Rappaport Vassiliadis
(RV) broth (Merck) and incubated at 42°C for 1 day.  After
incubation, the RV cultures were streaked onto modified
semi-solid Rappaport Vassiliadis (MSRV) agar (Merck) and
Desoxycholate-Hydrogen-Sulfide-Lactose  (DHL)  agar
(Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) and were incubated at 37°C for 18

hr.    Typical Salmonella  colonies  (1–3  colonies)  were
selected from each specimen for confirmation based on bio-
chemical characteristics [7] using triple sugar iron (TSI)
agar (Nissui), lysine indole motility (LIM) agar (Nissui),
catalase, oxidase tests and other biochemical tests.  Serotyp-
ing with anti-O and anti-H immune sera was then carried
out, and the antimicrobial susceptibility of the serotypes was
examined by the disk diffusion method [3] using BD Sensi-
Discs (BD) with Mueller-Hinton agar plates (BD).  Ten
types of antimicrobial disk, namely, 10 µg of ampicillin
(ABPC), 20 µg of amoxicillin with 10 µg of clavulanic acid
(AMPC-CVA), 30 µg of cefotaxime (CTX), 10 µg of strep-
tomycin  (SM),  30 µg  of  tetracycline  (TC),  30 µg  of
chloramphenicol (CP), 30 µg of nalidixic acid (NA), 30 µg
of norfloxacin (NFLX), 5 µg of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and
23.75 µg of sulfamethoxazole with 1.25 µg of trimethoprim
(SMX-TMP) were used for the tests.  In these tests, Escher-
ichia coli ATCC25922, were used as quality control strains.
The choice of the 10 antimicrobial disks was based on the
guidelines of BD Sensi-Discs for Enterobacteriaceae (http:/
/www.bdj.co.jp/micro/products/1f3pro00000qho5o-att/54-
sd-hantei-CLSI.pdf).

As shown in Table 1, all Salmonella strains isolated in
this study were identified as S. enterica subspecies enterica.
Salmonella spp. were isolated from 4 (8%) of the 50 buffalo
samples and 37 (76%) of the 49 pig samples.  In the buffa-

loes, serotype 9,12: –:1,5 was isolated from 3 animals, and
both S. Derby and S. Javiana were isolated from 1 animal.
In the 37 positive pigs, S. Derby and S. Anatum were found
in 12 samples, S. Derby and S. Weltevreden were found in 8
samples, S. Anatum was found in 8 samples, S. Derby was
found in 5 samples, S. Stanley and S. Anatum were found in
3 samples, S. Stanley was found in 1 sample and S. Wel-
tevreden was found in 1 sample.  In the present study, the
most predominant serotypes isolated were S. Derby (51%;
25/49), S. Anatum (45%; 22/49), S. Weltevreden (15%;
9/49) and S. Stanley (5%; 3/49).

We examined the antimicrobial resistance of 5 isolates
from the 4 buffaloes and 59 isolates from the 37 pigs.  All
the isolates from the buffaloes were susceptible to the 10
antimicrobials tested.  Table 2 shows the proportion of Sal-
monella isolates from the pigs demonstrating antimicrobial
resistance by serotype.  The resistance rates to ABPC,
AMPC-CVA, SM, TC, CP, NA and SMX-TMP of the pig
isolates  were 14%,  2%, 22%,  24%, 5%,  2% and  12%,
respectively; all  the isolates  were susceptible to  CTX,
NFLX and CPFX.

Table 3 shows the profile of antimicrobial resistance of
the Salmonella isolates from the pigs.  Among the 21 resis-
tant isolates, there were 8 multidrug resistance patterns, and
the ABPC/SM/TC/CP/SMX-TMP pattern was the most fre-
quent (3 strains; all S. Derby).  Monodrug resistance to SM

(6 strains; all S. Derby) and TC (3 strains; 2 strains of S.
Anatum and 1 strain of S. Derby) was predominant in the
isolates  from  pigs.    Multiantimicrobial  resistance  was
shown by S. Derby, S. Anatum and S. Stanley.  

In the present study, the prevalence of Salmonella in the
buffaloes was 8% (4/50), and the most predominant sero-
type identified was 9,12:–:1,5.   To the best of our knowl-
edge,  there  are  no  reports  available  concerning  the
prevalence of Salmonella in buffaloes in Asia.  The preva-
lence of Salmonella among domestic buffaloes in Laos may
generally be around 8%, and serotype 9,12:–:1,5 may partic-
ularly be observed in buffaloes in Laos.

The prevalence of Salmonella in the pigs was 76% (37/
49), and the most predominant serotypes identified were S.
Derby and S. Anatum.  The prevalence and serotypes of the
isolates in the pigs were thought to depend on geographic
location; for example, in a previous study, 12% (7/110
heads) of slaughtered pigs in Gunma Prefecture, Japan, har-
bored Salmonella, and the predominant serotypes were S.
Typhimurium and S. Derby [13].  On the other hand, in a
study conducted in Vietnam, Salmonella spp. were isolated
from 5% (23/439 heads) of pigs, and the predominant sero-
types were S. Javiana (9/25 strains), S. Derby(4/25 strains)
and S. Weltevreden (3/25 strains) [15].  In a study conducted
in Northern Thailand, the overall prevalence of Salmonella
in pigs in slaughterhouses was 28% (97/349 strains), and
most of the serotypes isolated were S. Rissen, S. Weltevre-

den and S. Anatum [11].  The prevalence of Salmonella in
Laos obtained in the present study was higher than that in
other Asian countries.  We could not, however, confirm the
number of farms from which the pigs were shipped by the 6
livestock brokers, and the present study was conducted in
only 1 slaughterhouse.  In Laos, large-scale commercial pig
production is not common and therefore many pigs are bred
on personal farms.  In this regard, additional surveys of dif-
ferent pig farms are necessary.  S. Derby and S. Anatum are
the most common serotypes found in animals and humans
throughout the world; however, S. Weltevreden has recently
been reported to be a frequent and increasing cause of
human salmonellosis and is the predominant serotype in
Southeast Asian countries [1, 4, 14, 15].  The results of the
present study indicate that S. Weltevreden might be widely
distributed in pigs in Laos.

In general, high sensitivity to most antimicrobial agents
was observed among the buffalo and pig isolates.  In Laos,
the use of antimicrobial agents as a feed additive to animals
is not regulated; however, nobody gives feed additives to
animals because most pigs and buffaloes are bred on per-
sonal farms.  The unpopularity of using antimicrobial agents
as feed additives may be one of the predisposing factors for
many Salmonella strains with high sensitivity to antimicro-
bial agents.

The cecum contents of pigs and buffaloes may be poten-
tial vehicles for contaminating edible products at slaughter-

houses.  A survey of the prevalence of Salmonella spp. in
other food animals, such as chickens, and other foods should
be performed to determine the important sources of Salmo-
nella infection in Laos.
