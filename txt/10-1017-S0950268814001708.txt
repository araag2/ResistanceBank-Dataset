SUMMARY

This study was undertaken to survey the presence of Salmonella in 200 chicken samples collected
from Mansoura, Egypt. Salmonella was detected in 16% (8/50), 28% (14/50), 32% (16/50) and
60% (30/50) of whole chicken carcasses, drumsticks, livers and gizzards, respectively, with an
overall prevalence of 34% (68/200) among all samples. One hundred and sixty-six isolates were
identiﬁed biochemically as Salmonella, and conﬁrmed genetically by PCR, based on the presence
of invA and stn genes. The spvC gene, however, was detected in only 25·3% (42/166) of the
isolates. Isolates were serotyped as Salmonella Enteritidis (37·3%), S. Typhimurium (30·1%),
S. Kentucky (10·8%), S. Muenster (8·4%), S. Virchow (4·8%), S. Anatum (4·8%), S. Haifa
(1·2%), and four were non-typable. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests of the Salmonella isolates
revealed that 100% were resistant to each of erythromycin, penicillin, and amoxicillin, while
98·8%, 96·4%, 95·2%, and 91·6% were resistant to nalidixic acid, sulphamethoxazole,
oxytetracycline, and ampicillin, respectively. Multidrug resistance was evident for 92·8% of the
isolates. The high contamination level of chicken meat with multidrug-resistant Salmonella can
constitute a problem for public health.

INTRODUCTION

Salmonella is one of the most important causative
agents of foodborne infection in both developed and
developing countries [1]. In the USA, it has been esti-
mated that about 87% of all Salmonella-conﬁrmed
cases are foodborne, with 10% due to person-to-person
infection, and 3% to pets [2]. Poultry and poultry pro-
ducts are among the main food sources most often

incriminated in outbreaks of human salmonellosis
[3, 4] and infection frequently occurs as a result of cross-
contamination from equipment, utensils and workers’
hands with subsequent handling of raw carcasses and
products, in addition to the consumption of under-
cooked poultry meat [5].

In recent years, there has been an increase in the inci-
dence of human salmonellosis that is more difﬁcult
to treat due to the appearance of multidrug-resistant
strains, especially S. Typhimurium, which have been
isolated from various foods of animal origin worldwide
[6]. The high prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant
bacteria throughout the food industry is probably due
to widespread overuse of common antimicrobials as

therapeutics, prophylactics or growth promoters in
food animals [7].

Although all the serovars of S. enterica are con-
sidered potentially pathogenic, there are considerable
differences in their virulence to humans and this has
been attributed to the absence or presence of plasmids
carrying virulence-associated genes [8]. The invasion
A (invA) gene is unique to all Salmonella serovars
and is an internationally recognized marker for the
rapid detection of Salmonella genus [9]. The invA
gene is required for invasion of the organism into
host cells [10], while the enterotoxin (stn) gene encodes
a protein which mediates severe diarrhoea has also
been utilized as a PCR target for the detection of
Salmonella strains [11]. The Salmonella plasmid viru-
lence gene, spvC, is believed to increase the growth
rate of salmonellae in host cells and affect their inter-
action with the host immune system [12].

Due to the increased incidence of resistant or multi-
resistant Salmonella isolates worldwide against many
commonly used antimicrobials, this study set out to
determine the prevalence, serotypes, presence of viru-
lence genes, and antimicrobial resistance of Salmon-
ella isolates from chicken carcasses and giblets from
retail outlets in Mansoura city, Egypt.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample collection and bacteriological analysis

In total, 200 chicken samples (50 each of whole
chicken carcasses, drumsticks, gizzards and livers)
were randomly collected from 25 retail shops and
supermarkets, of different sanitation levels, distributed
in Mansoura city, Egypt on 10 occasions during the
period June–November 2012. Each of the 25 shops
was visited twice for sampling. On each sampling oc-
casion, ﬁve shops were visited, and four samples
(whole chicken carcass, drumstick, gizzard and liver)
were taken from each shop. Each sample was pack-
aged individually into a sterile impermeable polyethyl-
ene bag,
labelled and transferred within 1 h in an
icebox at ∼4 °C to the food hygiene laboratory for
bacteriological analyses. The test portion for analysis
was 25 g outer skin of whole chicken carcasses, skin
plus muscle of drumsticks, and tissue from gizzards
or livers excised aseptically with a sterile scalpel for
each individual sample.

Each test portion was transferred into a sterile
homogenizer ﬂask containing 225 ml of sterile buf-
fered peptone water (Oxoid, UK) and homogenized

subcultured on

for 1 min in a stomacher (Seward Medical, UK). The
homogenate was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h then 0·1
and 1 ml volumes were aseptically added to 10 ml
each of Rappaport Vassilliadis (RV) broth (Oxoid)
and Muller–Kauffmann
tetrathionate/novobiocin
(MKTTn) broth (Oxoid), and incubated at 42 °C for
24 h and 37 °C for 24 h, respectively. These broths
were
xylose-lysine-desoxycholate
(XLD) agar (Oxoid) and Brilliant Green agar (BGA)
with sulfadiazine (Neogen Corp., USA) which were
incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, and at 35 °C for 24 h,
respectively. Up to ﬁve typical (pink colonies with or
without black centres) or suspected colonies of pre-
sumptive Salmonella were subcultured onto nutrient
agar slopes and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h for further
biochemical and serological identiﬁcation.

Identiﬁcation of presumptive Salmonella isolates
was performed according to standard methods [13]
and carbohydrate fermentation proﬁle using the API
Rapid 20E system (bioMérieux, France) according
to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Biochemically
conﬁrmed Salmonella isolates were serotyped by
slide agglutination with O and H polyvalent antisera
(Wellcome Diagnostic, UK).

Molecular analysis

Genomic DNA was prepared by a method described
previously [14]. Salmonella Typhimurium (RIMD
1 985 009) and Escherichia coli K12DH5α were used
as positive and negative control strains, respectively,
for the presence and absence of invA, stn and spvC
genes. The primers for PCR ampliﬁcation of invA
(244 bp) were as described previously [15]. For PCR
ampliﬁcation of stn,
two oligonucleotide primers
(forward:5′-CTTAATCGCGCCGCCATGCTGTT-3′;
reverse: 5′-CATGAACTGGCGCAGGTGAT-3′) were
constructed to produce an ampliﬁed band size of
480 bp. For ampliﬁcation of spvC, two primers (for-
ward: 5′-AACGGTTCCTCACGTAAAGCCTGT-3′;
reverse: 5′- ACCAAATGCGGAAGATGCCGGT-
AT-3′) produced an ampliﬁed band size of 580 bp.
PCR was performed in a 15-μl volume comprising 1 μl
Salmonella DNA template, 1·6 μl each of forward and
reverse primers (3 pmol each), 3 μl dNTPs (2 mM),
7·5 μl of 2 × PCR buffer for KOD FX, and 0·3 μl
KOD FX DNA polymerase (Toyobo Co. Ltd,
Japan). After an initial denaturation at 94 °C for
2 min, 35 cycles (98 °C for 10 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 68 °C
for 30 s) were performed followed by a ﬁnal extension
at 68 °C for 7 min. Ampliﬁed genes were veriﬁed by

DNA sequencing with the BigDye Terminator v. 3.1
Cycle Sequencing kit
(Applied BioSystems, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions on an
ABI Prism 3100 automated sequencer
(Applied
Biosystems). Nucleotide sequence data were analysed
with GENETYXMAC software, v. 12 (GENETYX
Corp., Japan). Homology searches of the obtained
sequences against the already published genes in the
GenBank were performed using Standard Nucleotide
BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).

Antimicrobial susceptibility tests

The antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella isolates
was determined by an agar disk diffusion standard
method [16] on Mueller–Hinton agar
(Oxoid).
Antibiotic discs were obtained from Difco (USA)
and bioMérieux at the following drug concentrations:
erythromycin (15 μg), nalidixic acid (30 μg), penicillin
(10 IU), amoxicillin (30 μg), oxytetracycline (30 μg),
sulphamethoxazole (25 μg), ampicillin (10 μg), strepto-
mycin (10 μg), neomycin (30 μg), chloramphenicol
(30 μg), norﬂoxacin (10 μg), ciproﬂoxacin (5 μg), kana-
mycin (30 μg), and gentamicin (10 μg). Isolates were
classiﬁed as susceptible,
intermediate or resistant
according to National Committee
for Clinical
Laboratory Standards criteria [16], with intermediate
susceptibility counted as resistant. E. coli ATCC

RESULTS

Salmonella spp. were detected in 34% (68/200) of
all chicken samples, distributed as 16% (8/50), 28%
(14/50), 32% (16/50) and 60% (30/50) among whole
chicken carcasses, drumsticks,
livers, and gizzards,
respectively. By PCR, all 166 isolates were positive
for the invA and stn genes; while 25·3% (42/166)
carried the spvC gene (Fig. 1) and were mainly
S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis. The speciﬁc pri-
mers used in the present study exhibited good ampliﬁ-
cation efﬁciency for detection of the target genes and
produced sufﬁcient DNA for sequence analysis to
conﬁrm the identity of the ampliﬁed genes.

(95·2%), and ampicillin (91·6%). The lowest rates
were recorded for ciproﬂoxacin (63·9%), kanamycin
(41·0%), and gentamicin (21·7%). The analysis of
resistance proﬁles and MAR indexes of isolates by
serotype is shown in Table 3. The great majority
(92·8%, 154/166) of isolates showed resistance to 53
of the 14 antimicrobials tested. Two-thirds of isolates
(63·2%, 105/166) had a MAR index above the average
(0·582) and within these isolates 13 resistance proﬁles
encompassing eight to all 14 antimicrobials were iden-
tiﬁed. Among S. Enteriditis, 50/62 (80·6%), and all
of 50 S. Typhimurium isolates were resistant to 59
antimicrobials.

Only 12 (7·2%) of the 166 isolates exhibited resist-
ance to just one or two antimicrobials and these
comprised the less frequently occurring serotypes,
S. Haifa, S. Muenster and S. Kentucky.

DISCUSSION

Our results of the prevalence of Salmonella in whole
chickens and drumsticks are in agreement with the

prevalence rates of Salmonella in poultry meats
recorded in different countries which range from
19·2% in fresh and frozen chicken carcasses in South
Africa [17], 22% in Louisiana (USA) retail stores
[18], and 27% in retail market broiler chicken car-
casses in Colombia [19]. Higher Salmonella contami-
nation rates have been reported from several studies
ranging from 34% in Turkey [5] to 66% in Thailand
[20]. By contrast, only 0·6% of 168 samples of meat
parts of broiler chickens tested in an earlier survey
in Turkey [21] were contaminated with Salmonella,
while all of the 127 poultry carcasses tested in Brazil
were negative for these organisms [22]. Similarly for
chicken giblets (gizzards, liver, heart) reported rates
vary depending on the survey country, notably 86%
in Thailand [20], 34·5% and 41% of livers and giz-
zards,
in Ethiopia [23] and 3% in
Argentina [24].

respectively,

The wide variation in Salmonella prevalence in
chicken meat from different studies could be attribu-
ted to geographical differences, sampling techniques,
bacteriological methods as well as slaughter hygiene
and cross-contamination of products at different

stages of chicken dressing and preparation. The
observed greater contamination of gizzard and liver
samples over other samples may reﬂect greater ma-
nipulation of these organs in addition to contami-
nation from the crop and intestinal contents during
evisceration. As a result of the control programme
of Salmonella in chickens reared for meat production
in the UK,
the number of S. Enteritidis- and
S. Typhimurium-infected breeding chicken ﬂocks is
currently very low owing to the introduction of strict
control measures among which include management,
cleaning and disinfection, hen vaccination, pest con-
trol, biosecurity, monitoring, and the potential use

of other aids in the control of Salmonella [25].
Wider application of such programmes may therefore
be beneﬁcial in reducing contamination rates in some
countries.

The invA gene has been widely used for the detection
of Salmonella spp. in food samples and its presence is
highly associated with other virulence genes such as
the stn gene which contributes to the pathogenicity
process, primarily diarrhoea [26]. In S. Typhimurium
and S. Enteriditis the virulence plasmid is known to
increase the growth rate of the microorganisms at
sites beyond the intestine and aid colonization of
deeper tissue. Our ﬁnding of spv genes among these

serovars is therefore consistent with early reports of
their association with highly invasive serovars.

Gizzard samples proved to be the most contami-
nated (30/50) of tissue samples and yielded each of
the seven serovars detected from all samples. The
absence of certain serovars such as S. Virchow,
S. Anatum, and S. Haifa from some of the other sample
types no doubt reﬂects their low overall frequency and
perhaps less cross-contamination during preparation.
The predominance of S. Enteriditis and S.
Typhimurium in this survey echoes the results of
several other surveys of foodborne salmonellosis in
the literature, albeit with differences in counties in
the rates of these serovars [27]. However, low rates
of S. Enteritidis (5·9%) were notable from Turkey
[4], and 1·3% (1/73) from Brazil [22]; similarly low
frequencies of S. Typhimurium have been reported
from other surveys [17, 28]. S. Kentucky accounted
for 10·8% of all our isolates which contrasts markedly
with 59·5% and 41% in studies from the USA and Ire-
land, respectively [29, 30].

As expected, resistance to erythromycin, nalidixic
acid and penicillin was almost universal and high
resistance rates were evident for most of the antimicro-
bials tested which is consistent with the literature
[5, 28, 31]. In the context of agents that would be con-
sidered for the treatment of diarrhoeal salmonellosis,
it was surprising to ﬁnd relatively poor levels of
clear susceptibility to chloramphenicol (22%) norﬂox-
acin (32·5%), and ciproﬂoxacin (36%). Although 78%
of isolates were susceptible to gentamicin, this drug
would generally be used parenterally and only for
extraintestinal infections. The relatively lower rates
of resistance to norﬂoxacin, ciproﬂoxacin, kanamycin
and gentamicin could be attributed to their limited use
in animal production. Our ﬁndings corroborate the
widely held view that poultry is a major source of
multidrug-resistant Salmonella, and underlines the
value of antibiotic susceptibility surveys for selecting
appropriate
salmonellosis
caused by strains of poultry origin. The data also
serve to highlight the need for implementation of anti-
microbial
in developing
countries, including Egypt, to optimize their use for
treatment, and reduce the spread and development
of antimicrobial-resistant strains.

for

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a high
proportion of chicken carcasses and giblets sold in
Mansoura, Egypt were contaminated with Salmonella,
predominantly S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis, the
great majority of which were multidrug resistant.

Hence, chicken meat and their products constitute a
signiﬁcant problem for public health and this calls
for better antimicrobial stewardship to reduce the un-
necessary use of antimicrobials in the food industry.
