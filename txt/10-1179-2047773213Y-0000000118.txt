Importing day-old ducklings (DOD) unknowingly infected with non-typhoid Salmonella (NTS) may be
associated with disease risk. Domestic and international trade may enhance this risk. Salmonella enterica
serovars, their virulence genes combinations and antibiotic resistance, garner attention for their potentiality
to contribute to the adverse health effects on populations throughout the world. The aim of this study was to
estimate the risk of imported versus domestic DOD as potential carriers of NTS. The results confirm the
prevalence of salmonellosis in imported ducklings was 18.5% (25/135), whereas only 12% (9/75) of cases
were determined in the domestic ducklings. Fourteen serovars (Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella kisii,
Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella gaillac, Salmonella uno, Salmonella eingedi, Salmonella shubra,
Salmonella bardo, Salmonella inganda, Salmonella kentucky, Salmonella stanley, Salmonella virchow,
Salmonella haifa, and Salmonella anatum) were isolated from the imported ducklings, whereas only S.
enteritidis, S. typhimurium, S. virchow, and S. shubra were isolated from the domestic ducklings. The
isolated Salmonella serovars were 100% susceptible to only colistin sulphate and 100% resistant to
lincomycin. The 14 Salmonella serovars were screened for 11 virulence genes (invA, avrA, ssaQ, mgtC,
siiD, sopB, gipA, sodC1, sopE1, spvC, and bcfC) by PCR. The invA, sopB, and bcfC genes were detected
in 100% of the Salmonella serovars; alternatively, the gipA gene was absent in all of the isolated Salmonella
serovars. The 11 virulent genes were not detected in either of S. stanley or S. haifa serovars. The results
confirm an association between antibiotic resistance and virulence of Salmonella in the DOD. This study
confirms the need for a country adherence to strict public health and food safety regimes.

Introduction
Ducks are frequently used by human populations
throughout the world for a variety of reasons; duck
meat and duck eggs are consumed for protein-speciﬁc
dietary purposes, raised as pets for children, used for
natural de´cor on small ponds or lakes, hunted in game
preserves or conservation areas, and ﬁnally, used for
entertainment at country fairs.1,2 In the United States of
America (USA), 6.4 million households own and raise
ducks in their backyards for meat, egg production, or as
pets.3,4 Unfortunately, disease risks are associated with
contact with ducks and may contribute to adverse
health effects
in people. Aside from food-borne
infections, a cluster of non-typhoid Salmonella (NTS)
human infections has also been associated with day-old
ducklings (DOD).1–3,5–7 Salmonella outbreaks have
intermittently occurred every few years since the 1950s
when ducklings are purchased as pets during the Easter

holiday season.8–10 One case in the USA conﬁrmed a
single mail-order poultry hatchery was responsible for
an 8-year Salmonella outbreak and thousands of
infections in 43 states.11 Salmonella typhimurium has
been isolated from 40% of hatchlings and 1% of older
ducklings in Taiwan, even though clear host species
speciﬁc differences have also been detected.12

Salmonella has been previously isolated from
imported DOD in Brazil and the USA.11,13,14
Additionally, a signiﬁcant amount of the infected
duck products contained multi-drug-resistant (MDR)
foodborne pathogens.15 Because the prevalence of
Salmonella in duck products poses a risk to human
populations, an urgent need exists to investigate the
prevalence, disease risk to human populations, and
the global epidemiology of Salmonella serovars and
speciﬁc clones. This information may be used to
address Salmonella risk and promote evidence-based
interventions in global public health.

A diversity of virulence factors have been pre-
viously described for Salmonella;
these virulence
factors are located on the bacterial chromosome,

frequently as part of pathogenicity islands, on
plasmids and prophages.16 Although all serovars of
Salmonella enterica are considered pathogenic to
man,17 the distribution of virulence genes in serovars
is not well understood.18 An encompassing scientiﬁc
literature review also conﬁrms the negligible presence
of research focussing on understanding virulence
determinants associated with the isolated Salmonella
serovars with special reference to DOD.

An accelerated dissemination of resistant patho-
genic organisms from one geographic location to
another has occurred as a result of globalization and
international trade over the past decade.19 Yet, there is
a limited amount of data concerning the prevalence of
foodborne pathogens and associated antimicrobial
susceptibility phenotypes among imported poultry.19
A very important issue that has been debated is
whether the MDR strains are associated with virulence
determinants20 and thus have the propensity to be
more virulent
than their susceptible counterparts;
therefore, this study attempted to address this out-
standing issue on whether genetic determinants for
both antibiotic resistance and virulence genes could be
harboured by the same transferable element and
further conﬁrm the association between antibiotic
resistance and virulence in DOD.

Consequently, the objectives of the current study
were to determine and establish baseline data on the
prevalence of S. enterica serovars, virulence genes, gene
association and combinations, virulence genes encoding
serotypes, and antibiotic-resistant Salmonella pheno-
types in imported and domestic DOD in Egypt.

Materials and Methods
Sampling and isolation
All
imported bird samples were delivered to the
Central Lab for Veterinary Quality Control on
Poultry Production, Agriculture Research Center,
Ministry of Agriculture. A total of 150 imported
DOD were randomly collected from 50 boxes (25
birds per box; 3 birds/25 birds). Faecal samples
were collected from the 150 imported DOD for
culture and isolation of salmonellae; additionally,
150 faecal samples were taken from domestic DOD,
which originated from both small-scale and com-
mercial farms, whose production is primarily used
for buying and selling DOD. The 300 faecal samples
were analysed for Salmonella according to the
ISO-6579-1993 standards.21 Twenty ﬁve grams of
faeces were mixed with 225 ml of buffered peptone
water (Oxoid Ltd, Hampshire, England) for pre-
enrichment. After incubation at 37uC for 24 hours,

were identiﬁed on the basis of a Gram stain, catalase
reaction, oxidase reaction, and oxidation/fermentation

oxidase negative, and capability of oxidation and
fermentation of glucose were inoculated onto micro-
tubes of API 20E strips (bioMe´rieux, Marcy L’E´ toile,

Phenotypic Virulence Assays
Invasiveness profiles
Congo red binding
The method of Qadir et al.23 was used to test
invasiveness proﬁling. Congo red (0.003%, w/v) was
incorporated into nutrient agar before autoclaving.
Plates streaked with test strains were incubated at
37uC for 18 hours Colonies were examined for the
presence (red, crb zve) or absence (white, crb 2ve)
of Congo red binding.

Serum survival
Bacterial survival
in normal, uninfected duck and
chicken sera was assayed through Congo red
binding.24 Counts were determined at times T 5
0 hour and T 5 2 hours following addition of the
inoculum to 10% normal duck and chicken sera in
single strength Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS:
137 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.25 mM Na2HPO4,

eingedi, Salmonella shubra, Salmonella bardo, Salmo-
nella inganda, Salmonella kentucky, Salmonella stanley,
Salmonella haifa, Salmonella virchow, and Salmonella
anatum in addition to the two untypable isolates) in
the log growth phase were prepared in 16phosphate
buffered saline (PBS); 10 ml of each individual sample
was added to 90 ml of freshly thawed, undiluted serum
for a ﬁnal bacterial concentration of 106 CFU/ml. The
mixtures were incubated at 37uC with gentle rocking
(20 rpm); sequentially, 10 ml of each sample was with-
drawn at 45, 90, and 180 minutes. Serial dilutions of the
samples were plated onto LB agar plates to determine

the viable bacterial counts. Survival, expressed as
serum resistance factor, was determined at either CFU
at T 5 2 hours or CFU at T 5 0 hour. Mean results
were based on three independent determinations.

MDCK and Vero cell ingestion assay
The ingestion assay on Madin Darby Canine kidney
(MDCK) and Vero cells was conducted according to
Raja et al.25 and were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection, Rockville, Madison, USA. Cell
free culture supernatants (CFCS) of S. enteritidis, S.
typhimurium, S. kisii, S. gaillac, S. uno, S. eingedi, S.
shubra, S. bardo, S. inganda, S. kentucky, S. stanley,
S. haifa, S. virchow, and S. anatum, in addition to
the two untypable isolates, were prepared. Each
bacterial strain was grown in brain heart infusion
(BHI) broth for 24 hours at 37uC. After incubation,
an inoculum containing 56107 CFU/ml was taken
from which 100 ml was added to the wells containing
Vero and MDCK cells. Bacterial cells were allowed
to infect the epithelial cells for 30 minutes–12 hours
at 37uC. A control assay with uninfected cell lines
was also maintained. Live cells were removed, and
cytological changes were observed using an inverted
microscope.

Chicken embryo lethality assay
Embryo lethality was performed according to Wooley
et al.26. Overnight broth cultures of each isolate (S.
enteritidis, S. typhimurium, S. kisii, S. gaillac, S. uno, S.
eingedi, S. shubra, S. bardo, S. inganda, S. kentucky,
S. stanley, S. haifa, S. virchow, S. anatum, and two
untypable
isolates) were washed twice in PBS,
resuspended, diluted in PBS, and inoculated (total
volume of 0.1 ml) into the allantoic cavity of six 12-
day-old embryonated chicken eggs. Six PBS inocu-
lated and uninoculated control embryonated eggs were
also included in embryo lethality tests. Eggs were
candled daily; deaths were recorded as they occurred
until the embryos were 18 days of age. Allantoic
ﬂuid, liver, spleen, heart, and the brain of each embryo
were collected immediately upon death and used
for reisolation of the infected Salmonella serotypes.
Isolates causing embryo death of . 29, 10–29, and
, 10% were considered virulent, moderately virulent,
and avirulent isolates, respectively.

Mannose sensitive and mannose resistance
haemagglutination assay
The tests were performed in the presence or absence of
D-mannose at 37 and 18uC for 24 hours.27 Salmonella
enteritidis, S. typhimurium, S. kisii, S. gaillac, S. uno, S.
eingedi, S. shubra, S. bardo, S. inganda, S. kentucky, S.
stanley, S. haifa, S. virchow, S. anatum, and the two
untypable isolates were brieﬂy grown on buffered
glucose nutrient agar supplemented with 5% sheep
blood. The bacteria were
then suspended in
PBS for a ﬁnal concentration of approximately

1010 bacteria/ml; two-fold serial dilutions were created
in 96-well round-bottom microtitre plates. An equal
volume of 3% red blood cell (RBC) suspension (duck,
chicken, guinea pig, and human type O) was added to
each well of the bacterial suspensions. For mannose-
resistant haemagglutination (MRHA) test, 20 ml of
bacterial suspension was mixed with an equal volume
of RBC suspension on a cavity glass slide and then,
20 ml of PBS was added to the mixture. Reactions were
recorded as (z) for haemagglutination or (2) for no
haemagglutination. A control, consisting of RBCs
suspended in PBS, was included in the test.

To demonstrate mannose sensitive haemaggluti-
nation (MSHA) of the isolates, a 1% (w/v) D (z)
mannose solution was used to examine the inhibi-
tion of haemagglutination. The effect of carbohy-
drates was assessed by adding 20 ml of a sugar
solution to the bacteria-RBC suspension. A positive
control was also included in each test; this control
comprised equal volumes of bacterial suspension. If
positive haemagglutination turned negative, inhibi-
tion was recorded. The highest dilution reciprocal
of bacterial suspension with complete haemagg-
lutination of RBCs was considered the endpoint.
Reactions with titres above 1:4 were considered
positive, indicating the presence of speciﬁc hemag-
glutins. Each test was duplicated throughout the
haemagglutination assay.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing by disc diffusion
To determine antibiotic resistance of the isolated
Salmonella serotypes, each isolate was inoculated
onto Muller–Hinton agar (Oxoid) and incubated at
37uC for 24 hours These techniques were conducted
according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI)28 guidelines for disc diffusion tech-
niques using commercial discs (Becton, Dickinson
and Company, Sparks, Maryland, USA). After this
procedure, the zones of inhibition were measured in
order to assess resistance or susceptibility. The panel
of antibiotic discs used in panel screens belonged to
eight drug classiﬁcations. Selected antimicrobials were
chosen based on their common use in treating or
preventing Salmonella infection in humans. The
antimicrobial agents and corresponding concentra-
tions used in the study included ampicillin (10 mg),
amoxicillin (20 mg), gentamicin (10 mg), neomycin
(30 mg), streptomycin (10 mg), ciproﬂoxacin (5 mg),
norﬂoxacin (5 mg), nalidixic acid (30 mg), lincomycin
(30 mg), chloramphenicol (30 mg), colistin (10 mg),
tetracycline (30 mg), trimethoprim (5 mg), and sulpha-
methoxazoleztrimethoprim (23.75z1.75 mg).

lence determinants represent either highly conserved
(Salmonella pathogenicity islands, SPIs) or variable
(prophages, plasmid) regions within the Salmonella
genome. Bacterial strains of S. enteritidis (ATCC
13076) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 50034) were used
as reference strains. Except sopE1, a positive control
DNA from S. enterica serovar S. typhimurium strain
LT2 was used for all targets.32 For sopE1, DNA from
S. enterica serovar Hadar strain 99-0601 was used as
the positive control.

Statistical analysis
The distribution of single or multi-drug antibiotic re-
sistance phenotypes among serotypes was determined
by a contingency table analysis; this table analysis
included labelled rows 5 serotypes and columns

cance of homogeneity in antimicrobial
resistance
patterns among the groups was assessed using
Pearson’s chi2 exact test using SAS version 9.2 (SAS,
Cary, NJ, USA). Findings were considered statistically
signiﬁcant when P , 0.05. A contingency table allows
researchers to test the proportion of resistance bac-
teria across different serotypes while using Pearson’s

uno, S. eingedi, S. shubra, S. bardo, S.
inganda,
S. kentucky, S. stanley, S. virchow, S. haifa, and
S. anatum from the imported ducklings and S.
typhimurium, S. virchow, and S.
enteritidis, S.
shubra from the domestic ducklings. The preva-
imported duck-
lence of
lings was , 18.5% (25/135); serotyping of
the
Salmonella-isolated strains S. enteritidis and S. kisii
conﬁrmed a prevalence of 2.2% (3/135) in each
strain. The prevalence decreased to 1.5% (2/135)
in serotypes S. typhimurium, S. gaillac, S. uno, S.
eingedi, S. shubra, S. bardo, S. inganda, S. kentucky,
S. stanley, S. virchow, S. haifa, and S. anatum, while
the one untypable isolate was , 1% (1/135). The
prevalence of salmonellosis in tested local ducklings
was 12% (9/75) and serotyping of the Salmonella-
isolated strains, S. enteritidis, S.
typhimurium, S.
virchow, and S. shubra, recorded a prevalence of
2.7% (2/75) and 1.3% (1/75) in the untypable isolate.

Phenotypic Virulence Assays
Congo red binding, serum survival, MDCK,
chicken embryo lethality assay, Vero cell

Interestingly, S. enteritidis, S. typhimurium, S. kisii,
S. gaillac, S. uno, S. eingedi, S. shubra, S. bardo, S.
inganda, S. kentucky, S. virchow, S. anatum, and the
two untypable isolates displayed strong positive
Congo red binding, were resistant to serum bacter-
icidal activity, and survived for 3 hours in chicken
and duck sera. Alternatively, S. stanley and S. haifa
were weakly positive to Congo red binding (dis-
played by the orange colour) and were unable to
survive over 1 hour in the chicken and duck sera;
at the same time, the results conﬁrmed 100% of
susceptibility (after 12 hours of exposure to the
Salmonella cytotoxin in cell free sonic lysate) and
100% death of the embryos during the periods of
day-13 and day-17 in the two cell lines, Vero and
MDCK.

S. uno, S. eingedi, S. shubra, S. bardo, S. inganda,
S. kentucky, S. anatum, S. stanley, S. haifa, and the
two untypable isolates were 100% MRHA to duck
erythrocytes, whereas S. eingedi, S. stanley, S. bardo,
S. kentucky, and S. haifa were 100% MRHA to
chicken erythrocytes. In all, 100% MRHA to guinea

Distribution of resistance to individual
antimicrobial agents
to more
All Salmonella serovars were resistant
than one tested antimicrobial;
the serovars were
susceptible to only 1 (colistin sulphate) of the 14
antimicrobials (Table 2), but were all 100% resistant to
lincomycin. Resistance frequencies varied depending
on the antibiotic selection; all 14 Salmonella serovars
and untypables exhibited signiﬁcant diversity in their
resistance patterns. From the eight different classes, S.
typhimurium, S. shubra, S. eingedi, S. bardo, S. haifa,
S. kentucky, and S. stanley were resistant to seven
of them with the exception of polymyxin (colistin
sulphate). Salmonella enteritidis, S. gaillac, and S.
inganda were resistant to six different antimicrobial
resistance proﬁles (aminoglycosides, ﬂuoroquinolones,
lincosamides, phenicols, tetracyclines, and sulphona-
mides). A wide variety of resistant antimicrobials
occurred in the untypable Salmonella isolates; the six
antimicrobial-resistant proﬁles
included penicillins,
aminoglycosides, ﬂuoroquinolones, lincosamides, phe-
nicols, and sulphonamides. Salmonella kisii and S.
virchow isolates were resistant to only ﬁve antimicro-
bial resistance proﬁles (aminoglycosides, ﬂuoroquino-
lones, lincosamides, phenicols, and sulphonamides).
The least four antimicrobial-resistant proﬁles for S.
uno included aminoglycosides, ﬂuoroquinolones, lin-
cosamides, and phenicols, whereas for S. anatum the
least four resistant proﬁles included aminoglycosides,
lincosamides, phenicols, and sulphonamides.

Statistically signiﬁcant correlations for resistance
between the antimicrobials at the isolate level are
presented in Tables 2 and 4. The distribution of
resistance to the different antibiotics was
largely
dependent on the serovar identity. Signiﬁcant resis-
tance (P , 0.001) to amoxicillin (chi2 5 13.0) was
associated with serovars S. eingedi, S. shubra, S. bardo,
S. kentucky, S. stanley, and S. haifa. Chloramphenicol
(chi2 5 13.0) conﬁrmed signiﬁcant
resistance to
serovars S. virchow, S. shubra, S. eingedi, S. haifa, S.
kentucky, S. stanley, S. anatum, and S.
inganda.
Gentamicin (chi2 5 15.1) was associated with serovars
S. kentucky, S. stanley, and S. gaillac. Neomycin (chi2
5 14.2) was associated with serovars S. kentucky, S.
stanley, S. haifa, S. gaillac, S. anatum, and S. inganda.
Ciproﬂoxacin (chi2 5 34.0) was associated with
serovars S. shubra and S. kentucky. Tetracycline (chi2
5 26.8) was associated with serovars S. shubra, S.
eingedi, S. bardo, S. haifa, S. kentucky, S. stanley, and
trimethoprim (chi2 5 12.2)
S. gaillac. Finally,

Osman et al. Salmonella enterica in day-old ducklings in Egypt

S. haifa, S. kentucky, S. stanley, and S. anatum.
Signiﬁcant resistance (with a value of P , 0.003) was
also recorded for ampicillin (chi2 5 8.5) that was
associated with serovars S. shubra, S. eingedi, S. bardo,
S. haifa, S. kentucky, and S. stanley. Streptomycin (chi2
5 8.8) was also observed to be associated with serovars
S. shubra, S. eingedi, S. bardo, S. uno, S. haifa, S.
kentucky, S. stanley, S. gaillac, S. anatum, S. inganda,
and the untypable Salmonella isolate. Low signiﬁcant
resistance of sulphamethoxazoleztrimethoprim (chi2
5 7.0; P , 0.008) was associated with serovars S.
shubra, S. haifa, S. kentucky, S. stanley, and S. bardo;
low resistance also occurred in nalidixic acid (chi2 5
6.5; P , 0.01), which was associated with serovars S.
eingedi, S. haifa, S. kentucky, S. stanley, S. gaillac, and
S. inganda.

Virulence genes
All isolates were screened by PCR analysis for the
presence or absence of 11 selected virulence genes
(invA, avrA, ssaQ, mgtC, siiD, sopB, gipA, sodC1,
sopE1, spvC, and bcfC) (Table 3). The PCR screening
analysis detected the invA, sopB, and bcfC genes

that were conﬁrmed in S. enteritidis, S. typhimurium,
S. kissii, S. virchow, S. uno, S. eingedi, S. shubra, S.
bardo, S.
inganda, S. kentucky, S. gaillac, and S.
anatum isolates and the two untypable isolates; on the
contrary, the gipA gene was absent from all of the
isolated Salmonella serovars (S. enteritidis, S. typhi-
murium, S. kissii, S. virchow, S. uno, S. eingedi, S.
shubra, S. bardo, S. inganda, S. kentucky, S. gaillac,
and S. anatum), whereas the sopE1 gene (encoding a
translocated effector protein) was detected in the S.
inganda isolate, but
remained undetected in the
remainder of the Salmonella serovars. None of the
11 virulent genes were detected encoding either of
the S. stanley and S. haifa isolates. The spvC gene,
carried by the Salmonella virulence plasmid, was
expressed in 10 isolates of the isolated salmonellae, 9
of which were on the S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium
isolated from the imported and local ducklings. The
sodC1 gene,
in nine
isolates of the tested salmonellae, was isolated from
the imported and local ducklings; eight of these
isolates were S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium.

Virulence genes combinations
collections provided signiﬁcant
The 14 serovar
diversity in the virulence genes combinations. The
11 genes were absent from the isolated S. stanley and
S. haifa, which were isolated from the imported
ducklings providing the ﬁrst virulent gene combina-
tion. A second combination occurred in the S. eingedi
(2/2), S. bardo (2/2), and S. kentucky (1/1). A third
combination occurred in S. kissii (2/3), S. virchow
(1/1), and S. uno serotypes (1/2). A fourth combina-
tion was recorded with S. enteritidis (2/3). A ﬁfth
combination occurred in S. enteritidis (1/3) and S.
typhimurium (1/2). The two S. gaillac isolates had
a common virulence gene combination, but varied
from the other 34 isolates. Lastly, virulence gene
repertoires occurred in S. anatum and the untypable
isolate.

Association of antimicrobial resistance

The presence of invA, avrA, ssaQ, mgtC, siiD, sopB,
gipA, sodC1, sopE1, spvC, and bcfC genes in S.
enteritidis, S. kissii, S. typhimurium, S. gaillac, S. uno,
S. eingedi, S. shubra, S. bardo, S. inganda, S. kentucky,
S. stanley, S. virchow, S. haifa, S. anatum, and the one
untypable isolate in the imported ducklings, alongside
the Salmonella isolated strains
(S. enteritidis, S.
typhimurium, S. virchow and S. shubra, and the
untypable
from the domestic ducklings,
displayed various antimicrobial resistance patterns
(Table 4). A detailed analysis displayed associations of
resistance and susceptibility phenotypes with potential
virulence genes. The study conﬁrmed 14 tested
antimicrobials were not associated with any of the 11
virulent genes, which were not detected in either of the

isolate)

Discussion
In spite of
the long history of Salmonella and
ducklings, literature on DOD is scarce.14,21,33–35 The
high frequency of Salmonella recovery from imported
DOD causes great public health concern due to the
zoonotic potential of this pathogen and its econom-
importance to commercial poultry breeding.14
ical
Our study provided evidence of Salmonella infection
rates in imported and domestic DOD lower than
those reported in previous studies14,34–36 and higher
than those in a previous study in Egypt by Osman
et al.21 and in Vietnam by Lam et al.34 In 2005, Tsai
and Pi-Hung37 demonstrated that ducklings younger
than 2 weeks of age had a signiﬁcantly higher
Salmonella prevalence rate than other age groups.
Transovarian transmission is
to be an
important route of transmission to young birds;
rodents and other vectors are also thought to play an
important epidemiologic role in the transmission of
Salmonella to the birds.38,39–41 Horizontal transmis-
sion at hatcheries during feeding, handling, and
transportation is also known to contribute to the
spread of Salmonella;10,38,42,43 in fact, Salmonella
prevalence in hatcheries has been estimated between
20 and 60% for ducks.10,44 A study by Henry38
successfully conﬁrmed the importance of hatchery
contamination and Salmonella dissemination.

thought

scientiﬁc

The 14 Salmonella serovars isolated from the
imported DOD were substantially different
from
literature.1–3,5–7,11,13,14,34,45 The
previous
isolated serovars of DOD in the current
inves-
tigation have not been previously reported in
Egypt;21 moreover, because contracting Salmonella
causes adverse health effects and even mortality in
humans,46 this study may provide additional evidence
that may be used to address this impending global
public health issue in the future.47,48 The high
prevalence (5/34) of detected S. enteritidis is evident
by the fact that serovar S. enteritidis may have
contributed to ﬁlling the gap of an ecologic niche,
apparent by the considerable increase in S. enteritidis
prevalence after the eradication of biovar Gallinarum
in the 1960s.49

The invA target gene is unique and present in all
invasive strains of Salmonella,50 although generally
absent from related genera such as Escherichia.51

Although the invA gene was absent in our isolated
strains of S. stanley and S. haifa, it was available in
the rest of the isolated serovars.52–54 Interestingly, the
isolated S. stanley and S. haifa in our study lacked the
11 virulence genes. Therefore, in the absence of these
11 virulence genes (invA, avrA, ssaQ, mgtC, siiD,
sopB, gipA, sodC1, sopE1, spvC, and bcfC), we were
interested in proving the virulence of S. stanley and S.
haifa serovars and asked whether these serovars will
present a comparable virulence phenotype as S.
enteritidis, S. kissii, S. typhimurium, S. gaillac, S.
uno, S. eingedi, S. shubra, S. bardo, S. inganda, S.
kentucky, S. virchow, and S. anatum to Congo red
binding,
serum survival, MDCK and Vero cell
ingestion, chicken embryo lethality, and MSHA
and MRHA assays. The Vero and MDCK cell
culture model was carried out in order to compare
the abilities of clinical isolates of S. stanley and S.
haifa that produce a disease status comparable to in
vivo virulence and the results of the in vitro assay,
which are often used as correlates of bacterial
virulence phenotypes.25 The results of the patho-
genicity assays and the association between pheno-
typic virulence assays and the invasiveness level of S.
stanley and S. haifa serovars concluded their viru-
lence that encouraged us to hypothetically speculate
that these serovars may be using alternative invasive
mechanisms.52,55,56

In the decades following the licencing of ﬂuor-
oquinolones, an increased prevalence of quinolone-
resistant salmonellae has been observed in clinical57,58
and poultry isolates worldwide;59 however,
these
same classes of antimicrobial agents are also admi-
nistered in animals consumed by human populations,
which leads to the inevitable development of resistant
bacteria.60–62 The emergence of resistance to ﬂuor-
oquinolones among NTS is of particular concern,
because this class of antimicrobial agents constitutes
the ‘drug of choice’ for treating potentially life-
threatening Salmonella infections caused by multiple
antibiotic-resistant strains.63,64 Salmonella typhimur-
ium is among the serovars with the lowest average
antimicrobial resistance in the present study, which is
a positive indicator considering the nature of S.
typhimurium, an exposure to cause severe human
health effects; however, it is known that S. enteritidis
is less prone to developing resistance than other
serovars.65–67 The absence of resistance to ciproﬂox-
acin and norﬂoxacin among serovars S. enteritidis, S.
kissii, S. typhimurium, S. uno, S. eingedi, S. bardo, S.
inganda, S. virchow, S. haifa, and S. anatum is of
signiﬁcant value because these two antimicrobials are
the primary agents used against cases of invasive
salmonellosis in humans.20 It was previously indicated
that salmonellae exhibiting nalidixic acid-resistance
is usually displayed with decreased susceptibility to

sensitive and resistant Salmonella strains

ciproﬂoxacin.68–70 This was not evident
in our
investigation. Six and eight serovars were resistant to
ampicillin and chloramphenicol, respectively; how-
ever, it should be noted that these antimicrobials are
frequently used on Egyptian and European poultry
farms71,72 and may be the cause of the resistance
observed to the tested drugs in this study. The increase
in resistance to streptomycin observed in the present
study is not unexpected as this drug has been among
the most
frequently used antibiotics on poultry
farms.73 None of the serovars identiﬁed were resistant
to colistin sulphate, whereas ciproﬂoxacin was only
resistant to serovars S. shubra and S. kentucky. This
suggests a potentially effective treatment option for
Salmonella infections. The direct association of
virulence and resistance is determined in this study.
In studies of
the relationship between antibiotic
resistance and pathogenicity, the direct comparison
of
in
virulence assays has been a favoured approach.
Virulence and resistance are not independent proper-
ties but rather are closely related. In fact,
this
relationship can be seen in two ways: as genetic
elements carrying genes associated with both viru-
lence/resistance, and when the acquisition of resistance
affects the virulence of the bacteria.74 Virulence and
resistance might be contained in the same mobile
genetic element.74 The fact that genetic determinants
for both antibiotic resistance and virulence genes could
be harboured by the same transferable element implies
that there is a signiﬁcant association between the
presence of
some virulence genes and antibiotic
resistance.75,76 The majority of the molecular patho-
genicity determinants are located on the chromosome
or large virulence-associated plasmids,77,78 whereas
antibiotic resistance genes are also often located on
extrachromosomal genetic elements or in segments
inserted within the chromosome that originate from
other genomes.75 It has been reported that resistance
plasmids carry genes encoding virulence factors.79
Also, antibiotic resistance and virulence genes can be
linked in the same replicon, or eventually a single
determinant can be involved in both virulence and
resistance.79

Conclusion
It is difﬁcult to compare prevalence estimates obtained
from different studies regarding Salmonella across
geographic regions; several factors must be considered
when making such comparisons. While they may not
reveal true differences in the distribution of Salmonella,
one suggestion could include obtaining and perusing
information obtained from management systems,10,80
raising practices, seasonal patterns, processing pro-
cedures, and varying techniques currently used to
determine Salmonella prevalence.36

The emergence and development of antibiotic-
resistant Salmonella in the DOD may be due to a
variety of reasons. One such reason may be the
practice of dipping hatching eggs
in solutions
containing antimicrobial agents or/and routine inocu-
lation with antibiotics.39 Also, the occurrence and
proliferation of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella in the
ducklings have been linked to the common casual
usage of antimicrobials in veterinary practice.73,81 In
the present
the Salmonella serovars
exhibited full resistance to lincomycin and total
susceptibility to colistin sulphate; these antimicro-
bials are widely used in animal production environ-
ments for the treatment and prevention of disease as
well as growth promotion and have been listed under
the OIE list of antimicrobials of veterinary impor-
tance (Resolution No. XXVIII)82 as critically impor-
tant antimicrobials used in human medicine.60,82
