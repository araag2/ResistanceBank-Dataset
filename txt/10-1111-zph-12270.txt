Impacts
(cid:129) We report a higher prevalence of NTS colonization among chicken farmers

(4.4%) compared with age-, sex- and location-matched rural and urban
individuals not exposed to chickens (2.9% and 2.0%) in the Mekong Delta
of Vietnam.

(cid:129) This study reports high prevalence of NTS colonization (45.6%) in 204
backyard chicken farms in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. There was no
difference in the NTS prevalence between household-size farms (10–200
chickens) and small-size farms (201–2000 chickens).

(cid:129) Multidrug-resistant NTS accounted for 27.4% (45/164) of the chicken iso-
lates, 22.2% (2/9) of the farmer isolates and 12.5% (1/8) of the unexposed
individual isolates.

Summary

Salmonellosis is a public health concern in both the developed and developing
countries. Although the majority of human non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica
(NTS) cases are the result of foodborne infections or person-to-person transmis-
sion, NTS infections may also be acquired by environmental and occupational
exposure to animals. While a considerable number of studies have investigated
the presence of NTS in farm animals and meat/carcasses, very few studies have
investigated the risk of NTS colonization in humans as a result of direct animal
exposure. We investigated asymptomatic NTS colonization in 204 backyard
chicken farms, 204 farmers and 306 matched individuals not exposed to chicken
farming, in southern Vietnam. Pooled chicken faeces, collected using boot or
handheld swabs on backyard chicken farms, and rectal swabs from human partic-
ipants were tested. NTS colonization prevalence was 45.6%, 4.4% and 2.6% for
chicken farms,
farmers and unexposed individuals, respectively. Our study
observed a higher prevalence of NTS colonization among chicken farmers (4.4%)
compared with age-, sex- and location- matched rural and urban individuals not
exposed to chickens (2.9% and 2.0%). A total of 164 chicken NTS strains and 17
human NTS strains were isolated, and 28 serovars were identiﬁed. Salmonella
Weltevreden was the predominant serovar in both chickens and humans. NTS
isolates showed resistance (20–40%) against tetracycline, chloramphenicol, sul-
famethoxazole-trimethoprim and ampicillin. Our study reﬂects the epidemiology

of NTS colonization in chickens and humans in the Mekong delta of Vietnam
and emphasizes the need of larger, preferably longitudinal studies to study the
transmission dynamics of NTS between and within animal and human host
populations.

Introduction

Salmonellosis caused by non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica
(NTS) is a potentially zoonotic infection commonly associ-
ated with gastroenteritis and represents a signiﬁcant public
health problem in both the developing and developed
countries (Majowicz et al., 2010).

Although the majority of human NTS cases is the result
of foodborne infection (Anon., 2008) or person-to-person
transmission (Thompson et al., 2013), humans can also
become infected with NTS as a result of environmental and
occupational exposure to animals, including farm animals
(Fone and Barker, 1994; Baker et al., 2007; Hoelzer et al.,
2011). This type of exposure is particular prevalent in
developing countries, where a large fraction of the popula-
tion is involved in raising livestock and/or poultry. Farms
in these countries are typically backyard or small-scale and
farming procedures mostly involve low levels of biosecurity
and personal protection. This results in very close contact
between animals and humans. To date, very few studies
have investigated the role of exposure to farm animals in
asymptomatic NTS infection.

We hypothesized that exposure to chickens through
farming results in increased risk of asymptomatic coloniza-
tion with NTS in Vietnam, a country with a majority of
rural population. In this country, small and backyard
chicken farming is very common, with most farms typically
having less than 50 chickens (Burgos et al., 2007). To inves-
tigate this hypothesis, we investigated chicken ﬂocks and
farmers to study the prevalence and serovar distribution of
NTS organisms. The prevalence in farmers was compared
with that among age- and gender-matched individuals liv-
ing in the same areas but not engaged in poultry farming.
In addition, given the extensive antimicrobial drug usage in
these chicken farms (Carrique-Mas et al., 2015), we anal-
ysed and compared the frequencies of resistance against key
antimicrobial drugs of the most relevant classes, used in
both veterinary and human medicine.

Materials and Methods

Study population

The target population consisted of chicken farms, including
chicken ﬂocks and their farmers, as well as individuals not
involved in poultry farming from two rural districts and
the capital of the Mekong Delta Province of Tien Giang
(Vietnam).

(‘small

farms’, N = 102).

Sampling of farms was conducted at random within two
size strata: 10–200 chickens (‘household farms’, N = 102)
and 201–2000 chickens
In
selected farms, both ﬂocks and the person responsible for
raising the chickens (‘farmer’, N = 204) were recruited. In
addition to the 204 farmers, 306 participants not involved
in chicken or livestock farming were randomly selected
(‘unexposed individuals’). A subgroup of unexposed indi-
viduals (‘rural subjects’) were selected from the same com-
mune as the farmer and were matched to the farmer by age
and gender (N = 204, one per farmer). Another subgroup
of unexposed individuals (‘urban subjects’) were selected
from the provincial capital and were matched to the farm-
ers by age and gender (N = 102, one every two farmers).

Farm selection and chicken ﬂock sampling was carried
out by staff at the Sub-Department of Animal Health
(SDAH) in Tien Giang. Selection and sampling of human
subjects was performed from the population census pro-
vided by the Preventive Medicine Centre (PMC) of Tien
Giang (Anon., 2007b).

Written informed consents were obtained from all par-
ticipants prior to participation in the study. Participants
that refused to participate were replaced by the next
available eligible participant. The study was approved by
the Peoples’ Committee of Tien Giang Province,
the
Department of Health in Tien Giang and the Oxford
University Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OxTREC,
No. 48/11).

Sample collection

Farm and human household visits were evenly distributed
over a year period from March 2012 to April 2013 in order
to avoid seasonal effects. Pooled chicken faeces samples
were collected from chicken houses using boot swabs
(ﬂocks reared on barn systems) or handheld gauze swabs
(caged layer ﬂocks and ﬂocks on stilted mesh houses) as
described previously (Nguyen et al., 2015). The sample
collection was conducted by a trained sampling team from
Tien Giang SDAH.

Rectal swab samples were obtained from all human par-
ticipants by trained staff from Tien Giang PMC, using
Fecalswab (Copan, Italy).

All samples were stored at 4°C, transported to the labo-
ratory at the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in
Ho Chi Minh City and cultured within 24 h after sample
collection.

Laboratory methods

Salmonella was isolated using the modiﬁcation of the ISO
6579:2002 (Annex D) method for chicken faecal samples,
involving: (i) pre-enrichment in 225 ml of buffered pep-
tone water (BPW) (37°C, 18 h); (ii) plating 100 ll of the
pre-enriched culture onto modiﬁed semi-solid Rappaport–
Vassiliadis medium (Oxoid; UK) (41°C, 24 h) and (iii)
plating onto Rambach agar (37°C, 24 h) (Carrique-Mas
et al., 2009). For human samples, rectal swabs were cul-
tured on MacConkey agar, xylose-lysinedeoxycholate agar
and selenite broth according to the guidelines of World
Health Organization (WHO, 2010).

Suspected NTS colonies were selected for each sample
and conﬁrmed by slide agglutination with relevant poly
O anti-serum (Anon., 2007a). All isolates conﬁrmed as
NTS were further tested for their antimicrobial suscepti-
bility.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by
disc diffusion method, and breakpoints were interpreted
using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
guidelines for Enterobacteriaceae (CLSI, 2011). Eleven
antimicrobials were
tested including chloramphenicol
(30 mg), ceftazidime (30 mg), ceftriaxone (30 mg), amoxi-
cillin/clavulanic acid (30 mg), meropenem (10 mg), cipro-
ﬂoxacin (5 mg),
trimethoprim/
sulfamethoxazole (1.25/23.75 mg), amikacin (30 mg), gen-
tamicin (10 mg) and ampicillin (10 mg). Quality controls
for susceptibility testing and identiﬁcation were performed
every week according to the CLSI guidelines. An MDR
strain was deﬁned as a strain resistant to at least three dif-
ferent antimicrobial classes. Chicken farms and farmers
were the study unit of analysis. A chicken farm was deﬁned
as ‘positive’ for NTS if NTS was isolated from at least one
of the boot- or handheld gauze swabs.

tetracycline

(30 mg),

Conﬁrmed NTS isolates were genotyped using multilo-
cus sequence typing (MLST) as described previously (Acht-
man et al., 2012). Brieﬂy, pure colonies of overnight
culture on nutrition agar were subjected to DNA extraction
using Wizard Genomic DNA extraction kit (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA). Seven MLST loci (aroC, dnaN, hemD,
hisD, purE, sucA and thrA) were ampliﬁed and sequenced
in forward and reverse directions using the Big Dye Cycle
Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA)
on an ABI 3770 automatic sequencer according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions. Sequence data of seven loci were
trimmed and blasted to determine sequence type as well as
serotype based on data available on the MLST database
(http://mlst. warwick.ac.uk/mlst/dbs/Senterica/)

Differences in proportions were compared using the chi-
square test and Fisher’s exact test, when the chi-square test
was not relevant. A P-value <0.05 was considered statisti-
cally signiﬁcant.

Asymptomatic NTS Colonization in Vietnam

Results
Of 204 chicken farms, 93 (45.6%, 95% CI = 38.8–52.4%)
tested positive for NTS. There was no statistically signiﬁ-
cant difference in the NTS farm-level prevalence between
household farms (46/102, 45.1%) and small farms (47/102,
46.1%). NTS was recovered from nine chicken farmers
(4.4%, 95% CI = 1.6–7.2%), six rural subjects (2.9%, 95%
CI = 0.6–5.3%) and two urban subjects
(2.0%, 95%
CI = 0.0–4.7%). The prevalence of NTS did not statistically
differ between chicken farmers and unexposed individuals.
The prevalence of NTS among farmers of NTS-positive
chicken ﬂocks (5/93, 5.4%; 95% CI = 0.8–10.0%) was simi-
lar to the prevalence of NTS among farmers of NTS-nega-
tive chicken ﬂocks (4/111, 3.6%; 95% CI = 0.1–7.1%).

(28.0%),

Among 164 chicken NTS isolates, the highest observed
levels of resistance were against tetracycline (39.6%), chlo-
ramphenicol
sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim
(26.8%), ampicillin (26.2%) and amoxicillin plus clavulanic
acid (12.8%). The proportion of strains resistant against
ciproﬂoxacin and gentamicin was 1.8%. No resistance
against meropenem, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone was
observed. A total of nine NTS isolates from farmers and
eight NTS isolates from individuals unexposed to chicken
farming were tested for antimicrobial resistance, which
indicated similar levels of resistance against all
tested
antimicrobials. 27.4% (45/164), 22.2% (2/9) and 12.5%
(1/8) of NTS isolates from chickens, farmers and unex-
posed individuals were multidrug resistant, respectively
(Fig. 1). Interestingly, one of the two multidrug-resistant
isolates from farmers was identical to the most common
resistance pattern found in chicken ﬂocks (chlorampheni-
col – ampicillin – tetracycline – trimethoprim/sulfamethox-
azole) (Data not shown).

Multilocus sequence typing was performed on 163 of 164
chicken isolates from 93 chicken farms (one isolate could
not be recovered after storage) and on all 17 isolates from
humans. Salmonella Weltevreden was the most common
serovar detected in chicken farms (10.3% of farms), farmers
(2.0%), rural subjects (1.0%) and urban subjects (2.0%).
Besides Salmonella Weltevreden, the predominant serovars
in chickens were Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Paraty-
phi B var Java monophasic, Salmonella Albany, Salmonella
Derby, Salmonella Give, Salmonella Newport and Sal-
monella Typhimurium. Salmonella Enteritidis and Sal-
monella Typhimurium were only found in chickens and
were detected in 4.4% and 1.5% of the chicken farms,
respectively (Table 1).

Non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica were detected in both
chickens and farmers on ﬁve of 204 farms (2.5%, 95%
CI = 0.3–4.6%). MLST revealed that the serovar of NTS
isolates obtained from the farmer and their chicken on
the same farm were identical
in one farm (Salmonella

nam. The observed prevalence of asymptomatic NTS colo-
nization in humans was 3.3%, a ﬁgure considerably higher
than the reported prevalence of asymptomatic NTS in
developed countries (0.3–0.4%) (Hellard et al., 2000; de
Wit et al., 2001; Nataro et al., 2006). However, our results
were similar to the results from a study performed in 2004
in Hanoi, Vietnam (3.1%) (Do et al., 2007) and from Thai-
land in 2003 (4.7%) (Sirinavin et al., 2004).

We found a higher prevalence of NTS colonization
among chicken farmers (4.4%) compared with unexposed
individuals (2.6%). The prevalence of NTS colonization in
the rural subjects was also higher (2.9%) than in the urban
subjects (2.0%). Similarly, farmers of NTS-positive chicken

ﬂocks had a higher prevalence of infection compared with
farmers of NTS-negative chicken ﬂocks (5.4% versus
3.6%). However, none of these differences were statistically
signiﬁcant.

Our study demonstrated a high prevalence (45.6%) and
high diversity of NTS serovars in both household-size and
small-size chicken farms in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam,
similar to the results from a recent survey (64.7%) carried
out in Dong Thap, another Mekong Delta province (Tu
et al., 2015). In unconﬁned ﬂocks, swabs may potentially
gathered faecal material from other animals in the farm.
However, in those cases, sampling was carried out near the
perching and eating areas where chicken droppings were
visible, so it is expected that the overwhelming majority of
faecal material and Salmonella strains were of chicken ori-
gin. In terms of antimicrobial sensitivity, multidrug resis-
tance was commonly observed in the chicken NTS isolates.
Of antimicrobials of critical importance, the prevalence of
resistance against ampicillin was particularly high among
tested isolates (26.2%). However, levels of resistance against
aminoglycosides
(gentamicin)
ﬂuoroquinolones
(ciproﬂoxacin) were low (<2%).

and

We acknowledge several limitations in our study. Firstly,
the number of NTS isolates from humans was small, limit-
ing the power to demonstrate any statistical difference
between study cohorts. Secondly, the cross-sectional study
design may preclude the demonstration of transmission of
any particular serovar, which is highly depending on the
dynamics of NTS transmission between chickens and
humans. It is therefore possible that the presence of NTS in
the farmer results from earlier infection and further clear-
ance in the current chicken ﬂock, or from transmission
from a previous ﬂock. In addition, differences in NTS isola-
tion methods for chicken and human samples may have
had an impact on the sensitivity of detection. A higher sen-
sitivity of detection of the ISO 6572: 2002 (Annex D)
method compared with the WHO method for human sam-
ples is to be expected, as the former include a pre-enrich-
ment,
the
detection of low numbers of Salmonella such as those likely
to be found in asymptomatic chicken samples (Carrique-
Mas and Davies, 2008).

enrichment phase, which allows

selective

In spite of these limitations, we found that one of 21
(4.7%) of the farmers with Salmonella Weltevreden infected
chicken ﬂocks was also Salmonella Weltevreden positive
compared with three of 183 (1.6%) of the farmers without
Salmonella Weltevreden infected chicken ﬂocks. Interest-
ingly, the Salmonella Weltevreden isolated from the farmer
had an identical antimicrobial resistance pattern to the iso-
late from his or her chickens (fully susceptible). It has been
suggested that Salmonella Weltevreden may have acquired
properties which facilitate adaptation to a broader range of
hosts (Brankatschk et al., 2012), and Salmonella Weltevre-

den has been shown to be able to persist in manure and soil
for prolonged periods of time (Arthurson et al., 2011).

We believe that our study reﬂects the epidemiological sit-
uation of NTS in the Mekong delta of Vietnam, character-
ized by a high prevalence of infection in chicken ﬂocks and
a relatively high prevalence of colonization of human
adults. Our study also underscores the need for additional
larger and preferably longitudinal studies to investigate
transmission dynamics of NTS between and within animal
and human host populations.
