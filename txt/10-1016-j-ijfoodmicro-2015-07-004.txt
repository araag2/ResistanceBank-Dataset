The dissemination of drug-resistant Escherichia coli in poultry products is becoming a public concern, as it endan-
gers food security and human health. It is very common for E. coli to exhibit drug resistance in the poultry indus-
try in China due to the excessive use of antibiotics. However, few studies have examined the drug resistance
endowed by integrons and integron-associated gene cassettes in different phylogenetic groups of E. coli isolated
from broiler carcasses. In this study, 373 antibiotic-resistant E. coli strains were isolated from the surfaces or in-
sides of broiler carcasses from a slaughterhouse in Shandong Province, China. According to phylogenetic assays of
chuA, yjaA, and an anonymous DNA fragment, TSPE4-C2, these isolates belong to four phylogenetic groups (A, B1,
B2, and D) and seven subgroups (A0, A1, B1, B21, B22, D1, and D2). Of the tested isolates, 95.71% (n = 357) are
multi-drug resistant, among which group B1 was predominant, accounting for 33.51% (n = 125) of the tested
isolates. A high percentage of the E. coli isolates were resistant to amoxicillin–clavulanic acid (99.20%, n =
370), doxycycline (92.23%, n = 344), sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim (90.88%, n = 339), ciproﬂoxacin,
(64.61%, n = 241), sulbactam–cefoperazone (51.21%, n = 191), and amikacin (33.78%, n = 126). Furthermore,
among the 373 isolates, class 1 and 2 integrons were identiﬁed in 292 (78.28%) and 49 (13.14%) of the isolates,
respectively, while no class 3 integrons were detected. The most prevalent gene cassette arrays were dfrA17–
aadA5 and dfrA12–orfF–aadA2 in the variable region of class 1 integrons, while only one gene cassette array
(dfrA1–sat2–aadA1) was detected in the variable region of class 2 integrons. Class 1 integrons were distributed
in various physiological subtypes, whereas no predominant phylogenetic groups could be identiﬁed. The pres-
ence of class 2 integrons in the B21 subtype was signiﬁcantly higher than in the other subtypes, and it coexisted
with the class 1 integron. This study suggests that broiler products are potential sources of multi-drug resistant E.
coli, and that resistance genes could be spread by lateral gene transfer.

1. Introduction

Foodborne or opportunistic pathogens may cause illnesses in
humans who consume contaminated, raw poultry products. The exces-
sive use of antibiotics in the poultry industry increases the prevalence of
multidrug-resistant bacteria (Van den Bogaard et al., 2001). During
broiler slaughter and processing, antibiotic-resistant bacteria spread
quickly due to cross-contamination. This creates a potential public
health risk in that reservoirs of antibiotic resistance (AR) genes in food
sources may be acquired by human pathogens as a result of horizontal

gene transfer (Martínez, 2008). Processed raw broiler carcasses are
often contaminated with Escherichia coli (Bensink and Botham, 1983;
Turtura et al., 1990). E. coli is a typical Gram-negative bacterium that
causes colibacillosis, a common disease in chicken farms. Multidrug-
resistant E. coli with broad-spectrum drug resistance causes great difﬁ-
culties in the prevention and treatment of the disease in the poultry in-
dustry. Based on differences in genotypic and phenotypic properties, E.
coli is divided into four phylogenetic groups, namely groups A, B1, B2,
and D. The strains are categorized based on the presence of three geno-
mic DNA sequences that can be ampliﬁed and identiﬁed via PCR: the
chuA and yjaA genes, as well as the DNA fragment TSPE4-C2. E. coli
with the chuA, yjaA, and TSPE4-C2 genotypes (−/−/−, respectively)
(=A0) and −/+/− (=A1) belong to group A, −/−/+ belongs to
group B1, +/+/− (=B21) and +/+/+ (=B22) belong to group B2,
whereas +/−/− (=D1) and +/−/+ (=D2) belong to group D
(Figueira et al., 2011). Environmental isolates or commensalisms are
most often found in groups A and B1, while pathogens, such as

verotoxin-producing E. coli O157:H7, are predominantly found in
groups B2 and D (Clermont et al., 2000; Gordon et al., 2008; Picard
et al., 1999; Pupo et al., 1997).

Integrons are genetic units that possess the capacity to capture anti-
biotic resistance genes, known as gene cassettes, by site-speciﬁc recom-
bination, and they are associated with multiple drug-resistant
phenotypes (Cambray et al., 2010; Hall and Collis, 1995; Stokes and
Hall, 1989). Integrons are widely distributed in Gram-negative and
Gram-positive bacteria, although they are predominant in the former.
They play an important role in the transmission of drug resistance
genes among bacteria. Thus far, ﬁve classes of integrons have been de-
scribed (Mazel, 2006). Class 1 and 2 integrons are usually associated
with drug-resistant E. coli (Han et al., 2012). A typical class 1 integron
has a 5′ conserved segment and a 3′ conserved segment. The 5′ con-
served segment consists of the integrase gene (intI1), the promoters
Pint and Pc that are responsible for the transcription of the integrase
and gene cassettes, and a recombination site (attI). The 3′ conserved
segment usually contains the qacE gene, the sul1 gene, and a variable re-
gion. Class 2 integrons are often found in transposon Tn7. The sequence
of its integrase gene (intI2) is similar to that of intI1, but it is terminated
prematurely and does not encode a fully functional integrase. The gene
cassettes in integrons consist of a single gene and a recombination site.
Several cassettes may be inserted into the same integron to form a tan-
dem gene cassette array. Most gene cassettes in integrons contain anti-
biotic resistance genes (Fluit and Schmitz, 1999; Hall and Collis, 1995;
Partridge et al., 2009).

Several studies have investigated E. coli phylogenetic groups in
human and animal wastewater or other surface waters, as well as in
the internal organs and feces of animals (Ahmed et al., 2005; Fogarty
et al., 2003; Higgins et al., 2007; Johnson et al., 2005). Our previous
study showed that every E. coli phylogenetic group isolated from hospi-
tal wastewater and river water in Jinan, China exhibited antibiotic resis-
tance. Groups B2 and D, which are usually pathogenic bacteria, were
more prevalent in hospital wastewater. Integrons were closely correlat-
ed with the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in E. coli isolated from
aqueous environments (Han et al., 2012). Based on the research of
Han et al. (2012), 25 different gene cassettes were found in E. coli isolat-
ed from hospital wastewater or river water, 22 of which harbored anti-
biotic resistance genes in integrons. In this study, 373 drug-resistant E.
coli were isolated from a commercial broiler slaughter plant over a
four-month period in Shandong Province, China. Their antibiotic resis-
tance, phylogenetic subgroup afﬁliation (A0, A1, B1, B21, B22, D1, and
D2), and the presence of integrons and integron-associated gene cas-
settes were identiﬁed. This is the ﬁrst study of the correlation between
phylogenetic subgroups and the presence of integrons in drug-
resistant E. coli from broiler products.

2. Methods

2.1. Sampling and bacterial isolation

Samples were taken from a commercial broiler slaughter plant in
Shandong Province, China, in June 2013. Sterile, moistened swabs
were used to wipe 2 cm2 areas from the surfaces and insides of 89 evis-
cerated broiler chicken carcasses by the method of Chaslus-Dancla and
Lafont (1985). Swabs were agitated in 10 ml of sterile saline (0.9%
NaCl), and the suspensions were serially diluted. A 100 μl aliquot of
each dilution was spread onto eosin methylene blue (EMB) plates
(AOBOX, Beijing, China) that were supplemented with one of six anti-
microbial agents (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and the applied
concentrations were based on Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute
(CLSI) guidelines M07-A8 (2009), as follows: amoxicillin–clavulanic
acid (AMC, 32/16 μg/ml), ciproﬂoxacin (CIP, 4 μg/ml), amikacin (AMK,
32 μg/ml), doxycycline (DC, 16 μg/ml), sulbactam–cefoperazone (SBT/
CPZ, 64 μg/ml), or sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim (SXT, 4/76 μg/ml).
Based on colony color and morphology, individual colonies were

selected and transferred to 3 ml of LB broth (AOBOX) containing the
same antibiotic and incubated at 37 °C with shaking for 18 h. One milli-
liter of culture was stored in 25% glycerol at −80 °C, and genomic DNA
was extracted from the remainder of the culture using bacterial genome
extraction kits (BioTeke Corp., Beijing, China); DNA concentrations
were quantiﬁed prior to use in further studies.

2.2. Antibiotic susceptibility assay

Determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
using the E-test (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) was performed for six an-
timicrobial agents: AMC, CIP, AMK, DC, SBT/CPZ, and SXT using Mueller-
Hinton agar (MHA) plates (AOBOX) according to CLSI guidelines M07-
A8 (2009). The reference strain E. coli ATCC 25922 was used as a quality
control.

2.3. Phylogenetic subgroup assay

Drug-resistant E. coli phylogenetic subgroups were determined by
the method of Clermont et al. (2000). Primers targeting chuA, yjaA,
and TSPE4.C2 (Table 1) were used to identify the presence of these
fragments in puriﬁed DNA extracted from each isolate using PCR to
determine the phylogenetic groups to which each isolate belongs
(Clermont et al., 2000). The detection of the three amplicons, conﬁrmed
by sequencing, served as the basis for the phylogenetic subgroup deter-
mination. The PCR amplicon pattern deﬁning each group (chuA/yjaA/
TSPE4.C2) was as follows: −/−/−, A0; −/+/−, A1; −/−/+, B1; +/
+/−, B21; +/+/+, B22; +/−/−, D1; and +/−/+, D2 (Figueira et al.,
2011; Han et al., 2012). To determine whether the A0 subgroup was E.
coli, the presence of lacZ genes was determined, as recommended by
Higgins et al. (2007).

2.4. Occurrence of integrons and associated gene cassettes in antibiotic-
resistant E. coli strains

The primer pairs IntI1F/R, IntI2F/R and IntI3F/R were used to amplify
intI1, intI2, and intI3 (Table 1). Additionally, primers hep58/59 and
hep74/51 were used to amplify gene cassettes of class 1 and class 2
integrons, respectively (Han et al., 2012; White et al., 2000). The PCR
program was set as follows: an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min;
followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 40 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for
1 min, followed by a ﬁnal extension step at 72 °C for 10 min.

Furthermore, plasmids pJR88 containing intI1 (Kagan and Davies,
1980; Wohlleben et al., 1989; Xu et al., 2007), pIP1100 containing
intI2 (Biskri and Mazel, 2003; Xu et al., 2007), and pAV3.5 containing
intI3 (Xu et al., 2007) were used as positive controls for the PCRs.

2.5. Sequencing of gene cassette arrays

The gene cassette arrays of class 1 and 2 integrons were analyzed by
the PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP)
method, as recommended by Guo et al. (2011). PCR ampliﬁcation prod-
ucts of the variable regions of integrons were digested with EcoRII
(TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Dalian, China). PCR amplicons with
novel RFLP patterns were cloned into the pMD19-T vector (TA clone
kit; TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) and transformed into E. coli DH5α
for sequencing.

2.6. Statistics analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test (SPSS
17.0 for Windows; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). p-Values ≤ 0.05 were
considered to be signiﬁcant.

3. Results

3.1. Phylogenetic group analysis of antibiotic-resistant E. coli strains

In total, 373 drug-resistant E. coli strains were isolated from samples
taken from broiler carcasses. Among them, 81 isolates were from EMB
plates containing SXT, followed in descending order by AMC (n = 76),
DC (n = 71), CIP (n = 56), AMK (n = 48), and SBT/CPZ (n = 41). An-
timicrobial susceptibility tests identiﬁed that 0.54% of the isolates
were resistant to one antibiotic, 3.75% were resistant to two antibiotics,
and 95.71% were resistant to at least three antibiotics.

Phylogenetic assays revealed that isolated E. coli strains belong to
four different E. coli groups (A, B1, B2, and D) and seven subgroups
(A0, A1, B1, B21, B22, D1, and D2). A high percentage (33.51%, n = 125)
of isolates belong to subgroup B1, while 19.03% (n = 71), 15.82%
(n = 59), 9.38% (n = 35), and 12.87% (n = 48) of the isolates belong
to subgroups A0, A1, D1, and D2, respectively (Fig. 1). Furthermore,
6.17% (n = 23) and 3.22% (n = 12) of the isolates belong to subgroups
B22 and B21, respectively.

3.2. Antibiotic resistance and occurrence of integrons in antibiotic-resistant
E. coli strains

Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed on the 373 E. coli iso-
lates identiﬁed in this work, and they showed that a high percentage of
the E. coli isolates were resistant to AMC (99.20%), DC (92.23%), SXT
(90.88%), CIP (64.61%), SBT/CPZ (51.21%), and AMK (33.78%) (Table 2).
We analyzed the presence of class 1, 2, and 3 integrons in antibiotic-
resistant isolates. Among the 373 isolates, class 1 and 2 integrons were
found in 292 (78.28%) and 49 (13.14%) isolates, respectively, while no

class 3 integrons were detected. In addition, a high percentage
(67.35%) of class 2 integrons coexisted with class 1 integrons.

3.3. Gene cassette analysis of class 1 and 2 integrons

Among the 292 class 1 integron-positive isolates, class 1 variable re-
gions were successfully ampliﬁed from 199 isolates. RFLP-PCR and DNA
sequencing results of the inserted gene cassettes identiﬁed 11 types of
class 1 integrons containing 13 different gene cassettes (Fig. 2,
Table 3). Genes identiﬁed in these antimicrobial resistance gene cas-
settes include: the dihydrofolate reductase genes dfrA1, dfrA12, dfrA17,
and dfrA27 that confer resistance to trimethoprim; the aminoglycoside
adenyltransferase genes aadA1, aadA2, aadA5, and aadA16 or the amino-
glycoside acetyltransferase gene aacA4 that confer resistance to strepto-
mycin and spectinomycin; the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene
catB3 or the chloramphenicol efﬂux protein precursor gene cmlA1 that
confer resistance to chloramphenicol; the rifampin ADP-ribosylating
transferase gene arr3 that confers resistance to rifampicin; and a hypo-
thetical protein gene (orfF). Dihydrofolate reductase (dfr) genes confer-
ring trimethoprim resistance were the most common gene cassettes
(Table 3).

The most common gene cassette arrays of the class 1 integrons were
dfrA17–aadA5 (n = 83) and dfrA12–orfF–aadA2 (n = 74), which are
consistent with the results of previous studies (Han et al., 2012; Guo
et al., 2011). In 16 class 1 integron-positive isolates, no gene cassettes
were identiﬁed. Two different gene cassette arrays were found to coex-
ist in nine isolates: dfrA17–aadA5/dfrA12–orfF–aadA2 (n = 7) and
dfrA17–aadA5/aadA2 (n = 2).

In contrast, among the 373 isolates, only 49 isolates contained class 2
integrons, in which the variable regions of the class 2 integron were suc-
cessfully ampliﬁed in 46 (93.88%) of the isolates. Only one gene cassette
array (dfrA1–sat2–aadA1), which contains the three conserved resistance
gene cassettes dfrA1, sat2, and aadA1 that confer resistance to trimetho-
prim, streptothricin, and streptomycin/spectinomycin, respectively, was
detected in these class 2 integron-positive isolates (Fig. 2).

As shown in Table 2, all seven subgroups had a high level of resis-
tance to AMC, DC, and SXT, while subgroups B1, B22, and D2 displayed
higher resistance to AMK. In addition, subgroup B21 showed the highest
level of antimicrobial resistance to CIP. Meanwhile, subgroups A1, B22,
and D2 had lower levels of resistance to SBT/CPZ.

The prevalence of class 1 integron-positive isolates was similar in
different subgroups (Fig. 3). However, class 2 integrons were more fre-
quently detected in subgroup B21 than in the other subgroups (42%,
p b 0.01) (Fig. 3). Additionally, all class 2 integrons in subgroup B21
coexisted with class 1 integrons. No class 2 integrons were detected in
subgroup B22.

4. Discussion

Antimicrobial agents are widely used in feeding additives and ther-
apeutics, which has resulted in an increase in multidrug-resistant bacte-
ria. In this study, we isolated 373 drug-resistant E. coli strains from a
commercial broiler poultry plant, and examined the presence of
integrons and integron-associated gene cassette arrays in these isolates.
The results obtained from this work revealed that the broiler poultry
plant contained many drug-resistant E. coli strains, of which groups A
(A0, A1) and B1 were more predominant than group B2 and D strains
(Fig. 1); these results are consistent with previous reports of antibiotic-
resistant E. coli from hospital wastewater and rivers, surface waters, and
environmental and animal samples (Figueira et al., 2011; Han et al.,
2012; Higgins et al., 2007). However, Gordon et al. (2008) reported that
the frequency of subgroup A0 was much lower (b9%) than those of
group B2 and D strains isolated from soil, water, and sediment samples
in Australia. It seems likely that subgroup B2 and group D strains,
which are more likely to be pathogenic, are less likely to survive in the
environment.

The data from the antibiotic susceptibility tests showed that 95.71%
of the isolates had resistance to at least three antimicrobial agents. The
high prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria in food is considered
to be due to the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in commercial broiler

poultry farms (Aminov and Mackie, 2007; Biyela et al., 2004; Martínez,
2008).

AMC is an antibiotic comprising a β-lactam antibiotic (amoxicillin
trihydrate) and a β-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid). This combina-
tion results in signiﬁcant efﬁcacy against amoxicillin-resistant bacteria
that produce β-lactamase. A surprisingly large proportion (99.2%) of
the E. coli strains isolated in this work are resistant to AMC, possibly be-
cause of the overproduction of β-lactamase or loss of sensitivity to the
β-lactamase-inhibiting moiety clavulanic acid (Walter-Toews et al.,
2011). This disturbing phenomenon indicates a decrease in the efﬁcacy
of AMC in the repression of β-lactam-resistant E. coli, which could lead
to their potential spread in the poultry industry, possibly as a result of
the abuse of β-lactam type antibiotics.

The isolates in different phylogenetic subgroups of E. coli showed
different antibiotic resistance patterns. Compared with the other sub-
groups, subgroups B1, B22, and D2 displayed higher resistance to AMK.
As described previously (Han et al., 2012), groups B2 and D may have
a higher resistance to all antimicrobial agents. Therefore, considering
that most pathogenic E. coli strains are in these two groups, these results
are of great concern.

Fig. 3. The prevalence of class 1 or class 2 integrons in different E. coli phylogenetic groups.
intI1, class 1 integron-positive isolates; intI2, class 2 integron-positive isolates; intI1 + 2,
isolates positive for both class 1 and 2 integrons.

In this study, among the 373 tested isolates, class 1 and 2 integrons
were identiﬁed in 292 (78.28%) and 49 (13.14%) isolates, respectively.
Our results showed that the presence of integrons was more wide-
spread than that previously reported in southwest Nigeria, where only
14% of E. coli isolated from poultry farms were positive for class 1
integrons and 17% were positive for class 2 integrons (Adelowo et al.,
2014). This is an indication that class 1 integrons were more prevalent
in antibiotic-resistant E. coli at the broiler poultry plant in Shandong
Province, China.

Eleven types of class 1 integrons with different gene cassettes arrays
were detected in the tested isolates. All of the identiﬁed genes located in
the variable region of class 1 integrons were antibiotic resistance genes.
In contrast, only one type of class 2 integron containing a gene cassette
array (dfrA1–sat2–aadA1), the most classical type (Ahmed and
Shimamoto, 2015), was detected in these isolates. The inability to detect
type 3 integrons is not a surprise, as class 3 integrons are rarely detected,
and only a few have been studied in detail (Xu et al., 2007).

The most common gene cassette arrays of the class 1 integrons de-
tected in this study were dfrA17–aadA5 (n = 83) and dfrA12–orfF–
aadA2 (n = 74). In addition, dihydrofolate reductase genes (dfr) and
aminoglycoside adenyltransferase genes (aad), conferring resistance
to trimethoprim and streptomycin, respectively, occurred frequently
in the variable regions of class 1 integrons. This could be the result of
the overuse or misuse of trimethoprim and streptomycin in feeding ad-
ditives and therapeutics in commercial broiler poultry farms (Marshall
and Levy, 2011).

Because of the presence of an internal stop cordon (TAA) in the class
2 integron integrase (intI2) gene, the truncated class 2 integrase cannot
efﬁciently catalyze gene cassette integration and excision. As a result,
when compared with class 1 integrons, the diversity of gene cassettes
located in the variable region of class 2 integrons was much lower
(Ramírez et al., 2010; Wei et al., 2014). In the 49 class 2 integron-
positive isolates in this study, 33 coexisted with class 1 integrons. This
high rate of coexistence is consistent with the results of our previous
study (Xia et al., 2013), which showed that 63.16% of class 2 integrons
coexisted with class 1 integrons. As suggested by Hansson et al.
(2002), the intI2 gene of class 2 integrons, which bears a premature
stop codon, might be complemented in trans by class 1 integrases.

5. Conclusion

This study links the phylogenetic diversity of integrons and
integron-associated gene cassettes to the prevalence of antibiotic resis-
tance in E. coli isolates from a broiler poultry plant. These results indicate
that broiler poultry may serve as a reservoir of antimicrobial drug resis-
tance genes. The fact that E. coli strains from broiler carcasses contain an
abundance of integrons and antibiotic resistance genes is a cause for
concern. Our results strongly point to the critical need for the control
of antimicrobial drug usage in the livestock production.
