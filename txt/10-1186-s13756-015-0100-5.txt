Abstract

Background: Antimicrobial resistance in Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157 and non-O157 is a
matter of increasing concern. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antimicrobial resistance profiles
of STEC O157 and non-O157 recovered from feces of domestic farm animals in the agricultural Culiacan Valley in
Northwestern Mexico.
Findings: All of the examined STEC strains showed susceptibility to five antimicrobials, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone,
ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. However, resistance to the four antimicrobials,
ampicillin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, and kanamycin was commonly observed. Interestingly, non-susceptibility
to cephalothin was predominant among the examined STEC strains, corresponding to 85 % (22/26) of the O157:H7
from cattle, sheep and chicken and 73 % (24/33) of the non-O157 strains from cattle and sheep. Statistical analyses
revealed that resistance to ampicillin was significantly correlated to 38 % (10/26) of STEC O157:H7 strains from
multiple animal sources. Another significant correlation was found between serotype, source, and antimicrobial
resistance; all of the O20:H4 strains, recovered from sheep, were highly resistant to tetracycline. Multidrug resistance
profiles were identified in 42 % (22/53) of the non-susceptible STEC strains with clinically-relevant serotypes O8:H9,
O75:H8, O146:H21, and O157:H7.
Conclusions: STEC O157 and non-O157 strains, recovered from domestic farm animals in the Culiacan Valley,
exhibited resistance to classes of antimicrobials commonly used in Mexico, such as aminoglycosides, tetracyclines,
cephalosporins and penicillin but were susceptible to fluoroquinolones, quinolones, and sulfonamides. These
findings provide fundamental information that would aid in the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in an
important agricultural region in Northwestern Mexico.

Introduction
Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is a
foodborne pathogen and causes severe gastroenteritis,
hemorrhagic colitis, and the life-threatening hemolytic-
uremic syndrome (HUS) in humans [1]. Serotype O157:H7
has been implicated in most outbreaks [1]; however, other
non-O157 serotypes have been associated with severe
human infections worldwide [1–3]. Recently,
several
reports have documented a significant increase of anti-
microbial resistance in STEC O157:H7 and non-O157:H7
strains [4, 5], and antibiotic resistance of E. coli in Mexico
has increased over the years [6]. Inappropriate usages of
antibiotics for treating human and plant diseases and for
promoting food-animal growth are proposed to contribute
to antimicrobial resistance among bacteria populations
[6–9]. Moreover,
the use of antimicrobials to treat
STEC infections is controversial since they can induce
Shiga toxin (Stx) production, resulting in HUS in
humans [10–12]. However, other studies have suggested
that if some classes of antimicrobials are administered
early during the infection, STEC disease progression to
the HUS could be prevented [10, 13, 14].

STEC strains have been recovered from a variety of
animals, and cattle are considered the major reservoir
for STEC strains [1, 15, 16]. Recent evidence has indi-
cated that small domestic ruminants are also relevant
STEC reservoirs [16, 17]. Given that animals act as res-
ervoirs of STEC that could potentially be transmitted to
humans, thru direct or indirect contact, or via the food
chain, the present study examined antimicrobial suscep-
tibility in STEC O157 and non-O157 strains, recovered
from feces of domestic farm animals [16]. The domestic
farm animals were raised in small rural communities
within the agricultural Culiacan Valley in Northwestern
Mexico. The results indicated that STEC O157 and non-
O157 strains exhibited resistance to aminoglycosides,
tetracyclines, cephalosporins and penicillins, antimicro-
bials commonly used in Mexico [18–20]. However, all
examined STEC strains were susceptible to fluoroquino-
lones, quinolones, and sulfonamides, agents that can
induce Stx production [10, 12, 21]. These findings pro-
vide fundamental
information that would aid in the
surveillance of antimicrobial resistance patterns in an
important agricultural region in Northwestern Mexico.

Materials and methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
A total of 59 STEC O157:H7 and non-O157 strains
were isolated from domestic animal feces in small rural
farms, near agricultural fields in the Culiacan Valley,
Northwestern Mexico [16, 22]. The source, serotype
and virulence potential of the tested STEC strains were
previously characterized [16, 22]. STEC strains were

routinely grown at 37 °C on trypticase soy agar (Bioxon,
Mexico City, Mexico) under aerobic conditions.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method was performed
to test 15 antimicrobials, representing 11 distinct classes
(see Additional file 1), which are commonly used in
Mexico for animal food production and human infection
treatments [18–20]. Inoculums from each STEC strain
were grown aerobically in 5 mL Mueller-Hinton (MH)
broth (Bioxon, Mexico City, Mexico) and incubated at
37 °C to reach a turbidity equal to a McFarland 0.5
standard, according to guidelines provided by Clinical
and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [23]. MH agar
plates were surface inoculated with each STEC culture
using sterile cotton swabs, and antimicrobial paper disks
(BD Diagnostics, Mexico City, Mexico) were placed on
surface of inoculated MH agar plates. After incubation
at 37 °C for 16–18 h, the diameter of the zone of micro-
bial growth inhibition around the antimicrobial disk was
measured in millimeters. E. coli ATCC 25922 (American
Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was used as a
for antimicrobial susceptibility. The
positive control
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was
then
determined according to the interpretive criteria estab-
lished by CLSI to classify the STEC strains as sensitive,
intermediate, or resistant
to the tested antimicrobial
agent [23].

Statistical analysis
Statistical differences were determined by performing
the Fisher’s exact test with the R Statistical Software
(version 3.0.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria) [24]. A p-value ≤ 0.01 was considered
statistically significant.

Results
Susceptibility to all tested 15 antimicrobials was observed
in 3 % (1/26) of the O157:H7 cattle strains and 15 % (5/33)
non-O157 from cattle and sheep. All of the examined
STEC strains showed susceptibility to five antimicrobials,
CAZ, CIP, CRO, NAL, and SXT (Tables 1 and 2), and
approximately 90 % of the tested STEC strains showed
susceptibility to AMC, AMK, CFP, GEN, IPM and TET. By
contrast, non-susceptibility to the four antimicrobials,
AMP, CEF, CHL, and KAN was commonly observed,
and in particular, non-susceptibility to CEF, including
intermediate and resistant categories, was predomin-
ant among the examined STEC strains, corresponding to
85 % (22/26) of the O157:H7 (Table 1) and 73 % (24/33)
of the non-O157 strains (Table 2). Resistance to AMP was
significantly
the
(p-value = 0.0107). A statistically
O157:H7 strains
significant correlation was found between serotype,

correlated to 38 % (10/26) of

source, and antimicrobial resistance; all of the O20:H4
strains, recovered from sheep, were resistant to TET
(p-value = 0.0001), accounting for 75 % (3/4) of the
TET resistant STEC strains. No other correlation was
found for other non-O157 serotypes and antimicro-
bials tested.

Correlation analysis of non-susceptibility to more than
one antimicrobial, belonging to different classes, indicated
that 37 % (22/59) of the examined STEC strains exhibited
resistance to both the aminoglycoside KAN and to the 1st
generation-cephalosporin CEF, resulting in a statistically
significant correlation (p-value = 0.0001) (Tables 1 and 2).
Other observations were that 93 % (14/15) and 80 %
(24/30) of the AMP and CHL non-susceptible strains,
respectively, also showed non-susceptibility to CEF;
however, these associations were not found to be statis-
tically significant. The analyses revealed 19 distinct

antimicrobial resistant profiles, and 12 were classified
as multidrug resistant profiles (Table 3), indicating non-
susceptibility to more than 3 agents in different classes
[25]. These multidrug resistance profiles were observed in
42 % (22/53) of the non-susceptible STEC strains with
clinically-relevant serotypes O75:H8, O146:H21, O8:H9,
and O157:H7 (Table 3). The analysis also revealed that a
particular antimicrobial resistance profile was not signifi-
cantly correlated with animal source or STEC serotype.

Discussion
Many factors have been proposed to contribute to anti-
microbial resistance in enteric bacterial pathogens, such
as the inappropriate prescription and use of antibiotics
in the public, private, and agricultural sectors [6–9].
Moreover, data from surveillance programs in Mexico
have reported an apparent
increase in antimicrobial

resistance of E. coli over the years [6, 18]. In the present
study, resistance to antimicrobials, belonging to classes
commonly utilized in Mexico [18–20], was investigated
in zoonotic STEC. The STEC strains were recovered
from domestic farm animals in small rural communities
that were adjacent to the agricultural Culiacan Valley,
where the primary purpose of raising livestock is for local
consumption [16]. The findings of this study provide a

better understanding of resistance to antimicrobial agents
in an important agricultural region in Mexico and
will aid in the development of efficient and targeted
intervention strategies.

The results from the present study demonstrated that
zoonotic STEC O157 and non-O157, recovered from the
Culiacan Valley, were resistant to antimicrobials belong-
ing to classes such as aminoglycosides, beta lactams,

carbapenem, cephalosporins, phenicols, and tetracyclines.
In particular, resistance to CEF, a 1st-generation cephalo-
sporin, was prominently detected in 78 % (46/59) of the
tested STEC O157 and non-O157 strains. Interestingly,
the present study has demonstrated for the first time a
significant correlation for AMP resistance in O157:H7
and TET resistance in O20:H4 zoonotic STEC strains
recovered from Northwestern Mexico. In agreement with
published findings on STECs recovered from foods in this
geographical region [18], susceptibility was observed for
sulfonamides, quinolones and fluoroquinolones in the
recovered STEC strains. These agents have been found to
induce Stx production in STEC strains [10, 21], potentially
increasing the risk of HUS. However, all STEC strains
were susceptible to the 3rd-generation cephalosporin
CRO, which does not promote Stx production [21].

Classification of multidrug-resistance, based on re-
cently published criteria [25], was observed in 42 %
(22/53) of the non-susceptible STEC strains, harboring
serotypes associated with human illness [2]. Multidrug
resistance profiles, described in the present study, in-
cluded classes of antimicrobials commonly used in
Mexico, such as aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, cepha-
losporins, and penicillins [18–20], and these findings
highlight the need for surveillance of the antimicrobial
resistance patterns
in enteric bacterial pathogens.
Future work is aimed at further dissecting the genetic

elements contributing to the acquisition and dissemination
of the antimicrobial resistance genes in STEC strains recov-
ered from agricultural regions in Northwestern Mexico.
