ABSTRACT 
 
Objectives:  The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  isolate  and  identify  Staphylococcus 
aureus  and  Escherichia  coli  from  raw  milk  samples  of  cattle  and  buffalo,  and  to 
evaluate the antibiotic sensitivity pattern.  
Materials and methods: A total of 34 milk samples were collected twice from 17 
different  healthy  cattle  (n=14)  and  buffaloes  (n=3)  at  one-month  interval,  and 
analyzed  in  laboratory  by  staining,  cultural  and  biochemical  characteristics 
followed  by  polymerase  chain  reaction  targeting  nuc  gene  of  S.  aureus  and  16  S 
rRNA of E. coli. Antibiotic sensitivity pattern of the isolated bacteria was assessed 
using the disc diffusion method.   
Results: Confirmation of the isolates as S. aureus and E. coli were carried out by 
PCR using nuc gene, 16S rRNA gene specific primers specific for S. aureus and E. 
coli  respectively.  A  total  of  12  samples  (35.29%;  11  from  cattle,  1  from  buffalo) 
were  found  to  be  positive  for  S.  aureus;  5  and  7  during  first  and  second  month, 
respectively.  The  E.  coli  were  found  in  three  samples  (2  from  cattle,  1  from 
buffaloe);  one  in  first  month  and  two  in  the  second  month.  The  antibiotic 
sensitivity test using 4 commonly used antibiotics indicated that the most of the 
isolates  were  resistant  to  Gatifloxacin  and  one  isolate  showed  intermediate 
resistance to Ofloxacin while sensitive to Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin. 
Conclusion:  Two  different  species  of  bacteria  i.e.,  S.  aureus  and  E.  coli  are 
contaminating  with  milk  samples.  The  pathogenic  bacteria  can  be  controlled 
effectively by using Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin in the case of mastitis in cattle 
and buffaloes in Bangladesh.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Milk is considered as an excellent medium for growing of 
many  microorganisms.  Milk  can  be  contaminated  with 
several  bacteria  during milking  process from  the  milking 
personnel,  utensils  used  for  milking  (Rehman  et  al., 
2014).  Besides,  microorganisms  may  enter  the  udder 
through  teat  canal,  and  the  bacteria  may  come  out 
through milk (Smith et al., 2007). Staphylococcus aureus and 
Escherichia  coli  are  the  two  major  contaminants  of  milk. 
The presence of the pathogen in milk largely depends on 
fecal  contamination,  and  the  presence  of  pathogen  in 
feces mainly originates from feed contamination (Aycicek 
et al., 2005). 
 
Food  borne  diseases  are  of  great  concern  around  the 
world. However, this is an important issue in developing 
countries  where  poor  sanitation  is  maintained  during 
collection  and  processing  of  milk  from  cattle  and 
buffaloes  (Le  et  al.,  2003).  S.  aureus  is  an  important 
pathogen  for  dairy  ruminants  causing 
inflammatory 
reactions,  and  the  organism  is  believed  to  cause  30-40% 
mastitis  (Akineden  et  al.,  2001;  Asperger  and  Zangeri, 
2003;  Cabral  et  al.,  2004;  Katsuda  et  al.,  2005).  The 
organism  can  be  excreted  directly  from  udder  through 
milk  (Rehman  et  al.,  2014). Presence  of  S.  aureus  in  milk 
indicates  the  hygienic  standard  followed  during  milking 
process.  Information  on  antibiotic  resistance  against  S. 
aureus can be useful in treating the disease caused by the 
organism (Jahan et al., 2015). 
 
E.  coli  is  one  of  the  important  bacteria  of  gut  flora 
(Eckburg  et  al.,  2005).  Among  the  pathogenic  E.  coli,  
Shiga toxigenic E. coli (STEC) strains have been reported 
mostly  in  Latin  America,  India,  Bangladesh  and  many 
other developing countries (Kaddu-Mulindw et al., 2001; 
Rehman  et  al.,  2014).  Pathogenic  E.  coli  have  been 
isolated by several researchers in Bangladesh (Nazir et al., 
2005;  Khatun  et  al.,  2015;  Himi  et  al.,  2015)  from  fecal 
samples  of  healthy  cattle  (Hassan  et  al.,  2014),  raw  milk 
of  cattle  and  buffaloes  (Alam,  2006;  Islam  et  al.,  2008; 
Hossain  et  al.,  2011;  Jahan  et  al.,  2015).  In  Bangladesh, 
about  20%  of  all  diarrheal  cases  is  associated  with 
enterotoxigenic E. coli (Qadri et al., 2005). Moreover, very 
few  works  have  been  reported 
in  Bangladesh  on 
molecular  detection  of  pathogenic  organisms  from  raw 
cow  milk  and  buffalo  milk.  Besides,  selection  of

appropriate  antibiotic  against  the  S.  aureus  and  E.  coli  is 
crucial  for  proper  treatment  of  mastitis  in  cattle  and 
buffaloes.  Therefore,  the  objective  of  this  study  was  to 
isolate  and  identify  S.  aureus  and  E.  coli  from  raw  milk 
samples  of  cattle  and  buffalo,  and  to  evaluate  the 
antibiotic sensitivity pattern. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Sample collection and ethical approval: The study was 
design  to  investigate  the  bacteriological  analysis  of  raw 
milk  of  healthy  cows  and  buffaloes  collected  from 
Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) Dairy Farm. A 
total  of  34  raw  milk  samples,  regardless  of  quarter  of 
udder  were  collected.  Fourteen  samples  were  collected 
twice  from  14  different  cattle  at  one-month  interval. 
Similarly,  6  samples  were  collected  from  3  different 
buffaloes at one-month interval. In all cases, about 10 mL 
of  fresh  milk  was  collected  from  each  animal  by  using 
sterile test tubes after dispatching few drops of milk first. 
All  samples  were  collected  as  per  standard  sample 
collection  procedure  without  harming  or  giving stress  to 
any animal. The collected milk samples were immediately 
transported  on  ice  to  the  Bacteriology  Laboratory  at  the 
Department  of  Microbiology  and  Hygiene  of  BAU  for 
bacteriological  analysis.  Upon  arrival  in  the  Laboratory, 
milk  samples  were  kept  incubated  at  37°C  for  2  h  then 
cultured in 5% sheep blood agar, Salmonella Shigella (SS) 
agar, MacConkey agar, Eosin Methylene (EMB) agar and 
Mannitol salt (MS) agar by spreading method.  
 
Isolation  of  Staphylococcus aureus:  Primary  culture 
was  done  in  nutrient  broth  for  enrichment  of  bacteria. 
Pure culture of S. aureus was obtained based β-hemolysis 
on  blood  agar,  Gram  staining,  morphological  study, 
biochemical characteristics, catalase test, coagulase test, as 
per  the  procedures  mentioned  by  Cheesbrough  (1985) 
and Jahan et al. (2015).  
 
Isolation  of  E. coli:  MC  agar  media  were  streaked 
aseptically  with  200  µL  of  milk  sample  and  incubated  at 
37oC  for  overnight.  Appearance  of  bright  red  or  pink 
color  colony  was  used  to  culture 
in  EMB  agar. 
Appearance of the colony of pink/red and greenish black 
with metallic sheen was considered positive for E. coli in 
EMB  agar.  The  positive  colonies  were  sub  cultured  into 
EMB agar to obtain pure colony. The pure colonies were

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

 

Among 34 samples, 12 (32.29%) showed β-hemolysis on 
5%  cattle  blood  agar  with  circular,  small,  smooth  raised 
whitish  colony.  Islam  et  al.  (2007b)  reported  that  89.3% 
S.  aureus  from  bovine  origin  were  hemolytic.  This 
variation  was  due  to  the  difference  in  sample  origin 
indicating that raw milk contained less association with S. 
aureus  as  compared  with  feces  of  cattle  from  where  the 
bacteria  were  isolated  by  Islam  et  al.  (2007b).  After 
overnight  incubation  on  MS  agar  media,  some  plates 
showed  yellow  colony  and  some  plates  showed  whitish 
colony.  All  the  suspected  S.  aureus  which  produced  β-
hemolysis  on  5%  blood  agar  were  able  to  ferment 
mannitol  salt  agar  characterized  by  the  formation  of 
yellow  colony  and  white/transparent  colony  indicated 
other  Staphylococcus  spp.,  as  indicated  by  Cheesbrough 
(1985),  Begum  et  al.  (2007)  and  Islam  et  al.  (2007a,  b). 
In  Gram  staining,  the  organism  revealed  as  Gram 
positive,  violet  colored,  cocci  shaped  and  arranged  in 
grapes like cluster under light microscope.  Catalase test 
was  performed  to  differentiate  Staphylococci  (catalase 
producer) 
(non-catalase  producer). 
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was broken down into water 
and  oxygen.  Production  of  oxygen  was  indicated  by 
bubble  formation.  All  S.  aureus  isolates  were  catalase 
positive.  A  total  of  12  samples  were  found  as  catalase 
positive,  as  described  by  Cheesbrough  (1985).  All  the 
isolates of Staphylococci gave positive reaction in coagulase 
test  indicated  that  the  isolates  were  pathogenic  S.  aureus. 
The  positive  result  was  confirmed  by  the  formation  of 
curd  like  clotting  compare  to  negative  control  where 
there is no formation of curd like clotting. Isolation of by 
cultural,  morphological  and  biochemical  tests  were 
performed 
to  methods  described  by 
Cheesbrough  (1985),  Hummerjohann  et  al.  (2014)  and 
Jahan  et  al.  (2015).  In  Bangladesh,  S.  aureus  has  been 
isolated  from  several  sources  like  bovine  (Begum  et  al., 
2007;  Islam  et  al.,  2007a),  pus,  exudate,  surgical  wound 
swab,  burn  ulcer  exudate,  aural  swab  and  diabetic  ulcer 
exudate of human (Islam et al., 2007b).

raw  milk  cheese.  Here,  we  could  isolate  S.  aureus  from 
both  cow  milk  and  buffalo  milk  differing  from  the 
findings of Jahan et al. (2014) and Hummerjohann et al. 
(2014). 
 
The bacterial isolates identified as E. coli through cultural, 
morphological  and  biochemical  characteristics  were 
confirmed by PCR (Figure 3), as reported by Nazir et al. 
(2005), Schippa et al. (2010), Hassan et al. (2014), Himi et 
al.  (2015)  and  Khatun  et  al.  (2015).  The  E.  coli 
contamination  found  in  raw  milk  might  be  due  to  cross 
contamination  of  milk  with  feces  or  lack  of  hygienic 
measures during collection and processing of milk. There 
are  some  reports  of  isolation  of  E.  coli  from  rectal  swab 
of  bovine  animals  throughout  the  world;  for  example, 
Ogunleye  et  al.  (2013)  reported  a  prevalence  of  80%  in 
apparently  healthy  cattle  in  Nigeria.  In  Bangladesh, 
Masud et al. (2012) conducted experiment on isolation of 
E.  coli  from  rectal  swab  of  apparently  healthy  cattle  and 
found  23.21%  prevalence  of  E.  coli.  In  another  study, 
Hassan  et  al.  (2014)  reported  75%  rectal  swabs  of  cattle 
were associated with E. coli. E. coli has also been isolated 
from  different  sources  like  water  (Nazir  et  al.,  2005), 
broiler  and  layer  (Nazir  et  al.,  2005;  Nasrin  et  al.,  2007; 
Roy  et  al.,  2012),  diarrheic  stool  of  infant  (Nazir  et  al., 
2007)  and  diarrheic  calves  (Nazir  et  al.,  2007) 
in 
Bangladesh.  Many  of 
these  studies  have  applied 
molecular  technique  i.e.,  PCR  for  the  confirm  detection 
of  bacterial  species.  However,  to  the  best  of  our 
knowledge,  this  is  the  first  report  on  molecular  based 
detection of E. coli and S. aureus from raw milk samples of 
apparently healthy cattle and buffaloes in Bangladesh. 
 
Four  antibiotics  were  used  against  the  isolated  bacteria. 
Among  these,  all  S.  aureus  and  E.  coli  were  found  to  be 
sensitive  to  Ciprofloxacin,  Levofloxacin,  and  Ofloxacin 
and showed intermediate resistance to Gatifloxacin. Himi 
et  al.  (2015)  isolated  E.  coli  from  Bangladesh  and  the 
isolates were sensitive to Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin. 
We  found  some 
to 
Gatifloxacin. The possession of such factors by the E. coli 
isolates  signifies  the  fact  that  the  intermediate  resistance 
organisms  may  gain  resistance  property  due  to  the 
indiscriminate  use  of  antibiotics.  The  E.  coli  should  be 
considered  as  hazardous  to  health  and  advocate  the 
preventing  risk  factors.  However,  in  the  present  study 
Ciprofloxacin  and  Levofloxacin  were  proved  to  be  the 
best antibiotics to treat E. coli infection/mastitis in cattle 
since they were highly effective. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Mastitis  is  the  most  prevalent  disease  in  developing 
country which causes a huge loss in dairy sector and also

After overnight incubation, 3 samples showed bright pink 
or red colonies on MC agar, were identified as E. coli. For 
presumptive  identification  of  E.  coli, the  selective  colony 
on  McConkey  agar  for  each  sample  was  sub-cultured 
successively  onto  Eosin  Methylene  Blue  (EMB)  agar 
giving  greenish-black  colonies  with  metallic  sheen.  In 
Gram  staining,  the  organism  revealed  as  Gram-negative, 
small rod shaped, pink colored arranging single or paired. 
All the isolates fermented the five basic sugars (dextrose, 
sucrose,  lactose,  maltose  and  mannitol)  and  sorbitol 
producing  acid  and  gas,  as  reported  by  Cheesbrough 
(1985), Roy et al. (2012) and Chandrasekaran et al. (2014). 
All  the  isolates  were  catalase  positive,  VP  test  negative, 
indole  test  positive,  and  methyl-red  positive,  as  reported 
by Nazir et al. (2005) and Roy et al. (2012). 
 
In our study, we could amplify a 279-bp amplicon of nuc 
gene  (Figure  2).  This  finding  was  inclined  with  the 
reports  of  Jahan  et  al.  (2014)  and  Hummerjohann  et  al. 
(2014). Jahan et al. (2014) isolated S. aureus from raw cow 
milk  samples  in  Bangladesh  while  Hummerjohann  et  al. 
(2014)  isolated  Methicillin-resistant  S.  aureus  from  Swiss

has public health significance for consumers of milk and 
dairy products. Prevalence study of mastitic organisms in 
healthy animals is essential to reveal out the epidemiology 
of  mastitis  outbreaks 
in  Bangladesh.  The  bacterial 
infection  in  the  dairy  farm  of  the  study  area  was 
increasing day by day, which is a matter of concern in the 
livestock sector of Bangladesh. From the present study, it 
can be concluded that S. aureus and E. coli is prevalent in 
milk produced by healthy bovine animals in Mymensingh 
region  of  Bangladesh.  But  the  sample  size  in  this  study 
was  very  small  and  study  period  was  also  short.  This 
study  should  perform  with a  large  sample  size  and  for a 
long  period  of  time  will  reveal  the  actual  data  of  milk 
organisms in Bangladesh.
