Salmonella   spp.  is   acknowledged   as   a  signiﬁcant   zoonotic   foodborne   pathogen   throughout   the  world.
Contaminated   pork   consumption   is   considered   as   a  main   cause   of   human   salmonellosis.   In  the   later
stage   of  the   pig  production   chain,   poor   hygiene   and   unsuitable   storage   conditions   in   retail   outlets   are
considered   to  be   key   factors   linked   to   the   risk   of   Salmonella   infection.   The   purpose   of   current   study,
which   was   conducted   throughout   April   2014   to  September   2014,   was   to  determine   the  prevalence   and
characteristics   of   Salmonella   spp.  in   pork   sold   at   the   retail   stage   in   wet   markets   and   supermarkets   in   the
Chiang   Mai   urban   area   of  Thailand.   Additionally,   clonal   relations   between   Salmonella   strains   described
in   this   study   and   those   identiﬁed   in   earlier   study   from   the   same   geographical   area   were   considered.   It
is   provided   as  a  means   of  contributing   to   current   knowledge   regarding   Salmonella   epidemiology   with
an  ultimate   aim   of   improved   food   security   and  consumer   protection   in   this   region.   From   a  total   of   82
pork   samples   analyzed   in  this   study,   41%   were   positive   for   Salmonella,   with   prevalence   of  73.2%   from   wet
markets   (n   =  30/41)   and   9.8%   from   supermarkets   (n   =  4/41).   Twelve   Salmonella   serovars   were   identiﬁed,
S.   Rissen   being   the   most   commonly   encountered.   Antibiotic   resistance   of  the   isolates   was   highest   for
ampicillin   and   tetracycline   (53%),   followed   by   streptomycin   (44%).   Pulsed-ﬁeld   gel   electrophoresis   (PFGE)
and  subsequent   geographical   distribution   analysis   indicated   that   the  clonal   Salmonella   strains   originated
from   multiple   sources   had   been   spread   over   a  wide   area.   The   existence   of   a  common   pig   supply   chain
“farm-slaughterhouse-retail”   transmission   route   is   inferred.   Continuous   monitoring   of  Salmonella   along
the  entire   production   chain   is   needed   to  reduce   contamination   loads   and   to   ensure   the   safety   of  pork
products   for   end   consumers.

1.  Introduction

Salmonella  spp.  is  considered  to  be  one  of  the  most  signiﬁcant
zoonotic  foodborne  pathogens  and  is  a  major  public  health  con-
cern  throughout  the  world  (Visscher  et  al.,  2011;  Magwedere  et  al.,
2015;  Gibert,  2015).  Approximately  95%  of  salmonellosis  in  humans
is  related  to  animal-origin  food  consumption  (Lynne  et  al.,  2015);

contaminated,  undercooked  pork  are  implicated  in  several  human
cases  (Giovannini  et  al.,  2004;  Mürmann  et  al.,  2009;  Pires  et  al.,
2014).

Salmonella  can  be  introduced  into  humans  at  any  point  along  the
pig  production  chain  (White  et  al.,  2001;  Dorn-In  et  al.,  2009;  Wang
et  al.,  2015).  At  the  farm  level,  Salmonella-infected  pigs  carrying  the
organisms  in  their  intestinal  tracts  can  spread  Salmonella  to  other
pigs  directly  via  the  fecal-oral  route  or  indirectly  through  fecal  con-
tamination  of  the  environment  (Farzan  et  al.,  2006;  Hauser  et  al.,
2011).  High  bacterial  loads  in  pig  intestinal  tracts  can  be  expected
to  cause  high  contamination  rates  at  every  level  of  the  production
chain  (Tadee  et  al.,  2014).  The  slaughtering  procedure  itself  can  be

a  major  source  of  spreading  the  organism  from  the  pig’s  intestinal
contents  to  slaughtered  carcasses  if  the  processing  is  not  accom-
plished  properly  (Swanenburg  et  al.,  2001;  Gomes-Neves  et  al.,
2012).

At  the  later  stages  of  the  production  chain,  the  appearance  of
Salmonella  on  pork  at  retail  markets  or  butchers  results  in  a  high
chance  of  exposure  in  consumers  and  is  correlated  with  a  large
number  of  human  salmonellosis  cases  (Prendergast  et  al.,  2009;
Bollaerts  et  al.,  2010).  Appropriate  handling  and  processing  tech-
niques,  good  general  hygiene  and  suitable  storage  conditions  have
been  suggested  as  effective  means  of  reducing  or  stopping  col-
onization  activity  of  Salmonella  (Berends  et  al.,  1997;  Mürmann
et  al.,  2009).  Concern  about  processing  procedures  is  the  reason
that  most  health-conscious  consumers  prefer  pork  products  pur-
chased  from  a  supermarket  rather  than  those  obtained  from  an
open  marketplace  with  stalls  of  fresh  food  and  other  items  for
sales,  “wet  market”  (Hansen  et  al.,  2010).  The  vacuum  sealed  pack-
ages  with  origin  tracking  labels  in  supermarkets  greatly  increase
the  conﬁdence  of  consumers  when  they  are  making  their  selection
(Heather,  2014).  Despite  these  retail  practices,  there  is  no  guaran-
tee  that  the  pork  purchased  from  supermarkets  are  free  of  bacterial
contamination  (Whittaker  et  al.,  2009).

Tadee  and  his  colleagues  demonstrated  an  association  among
Salmonella  pulsotypes  at  pre-harvest  and  harvest  levels  of  pig  sup-
ply  chain  in  Chiang  Mai,  Thailand  (Tadee  et  al.,  2015).  Spreading  of
Salmonella  from  the  standard  pig  farm  to  slaughterhouse  over  the
wide  area  was   extrapolated.  The  study,  however,  included  only  a
limited  number  of  Salmonella  pulsotyping  proﬁles  taken  from  pork
products  on  sale  at  a  number  of  retail  outlets  and  butchers.  Addi-
tional  data  are  required  to  broaden  epidemiological  knowledge  of
Salmonella  throughout  the  entire  pig  production  chain  in  order  to
improve  methods  of  reducing  the  risk  posed  by  that  organism.

The  objectives  of  this  study  were  to  investigate  the  prevalence
and  characteristics  of  Salmonella  on  retail’s  pork  in  wet  markets  and
supermarkets  in  the  Chiang  Mai   urban  area,  and  to  determine  clonal
relationships  between  Salmonella  strains  described  in  this  study
with  those  Salmonella  strains  identiﬁed  in  the  Tadee  et  al.  (2015)
study.  That  expansion  of  knowledge  in  Salmonella  epidemiology
could  enhance  domestic  consumer  protection  and  help  promote
Salmonella-free  pork  through  appropriate  practices  for  pork  han-
dling  and  consuming.

2.  Materials  and  methods

2.1.  Sample  sizes  calculation

A  total  of  82  pork  samples  were  designated  from  “Estimate  Per-
centage”  function  in  http://winepi.net/  (Blas,  2006).  While  “70%”
was  an  approximate  rate  of  Salmonella  contamination  in  pork  sam-
ples  of  Thailand  (Angkititrakul  et  al.,  2005;  Butsi  et  al.,  2009);  it  was
used  as  expected  prevalence.  Ten  percent  and  0.95  were  selected  as
“e”  and  “Z1-␣/2”  value,  respectively  for  features  parameter  needed.

2.2.  Sample  collection

All  whole  pork  cuts  samples  of  approximately  300  g  each,  were
purposely  collected  from  all  14  wet  markets  (n  =  41)  and  22  super-
markets  (n  =  41)  located  in  the  Chiang  Mai   urban  area  (around
the  Chiang  Mai   Old  City  area)  between  April  2013  and  September
2014.  At  wet  markets  sampling  sites,  two  or  three  pork  samples
were  purchased  at  each  target  location.  Additionally,  at  least  one
pork  sample  was  randomly  selected  from  each  supermarket.  The
pork  samples  were  individually  packaged  in  a  sterile  container  and
transported  in  an  icebox  to  the  Bacteriology  Laboratory,  Faculty  of
Veterinary  Medicine,  Chiang  Mai   University,  for  Salmonella  isola-
tion  and  identiﬁcation  within  24  h  after  sample  collection.

2.3.  Salmonella  isolation  and  identiﬁcation

Salmonella  spp.  isolation  and  identiﬁcation  was  implemented
following  ISO  6579:2002  Amendment  1:2007,  Annex  D  technique,
to  determine  the  prevalence  of  Salmonella-positive  samples.  A  25  g
pork  sample  was  weighed  using  aseptic  techniques  and  stomached
for  120  s  with  225  mL   of  buffered  peptone  water  (BPW;  Merck,
Germany).  After  incubation  at  37 ◦C  for  24  h,  an  aliquot  of  0.1  mL
of  homogenized  mixture  was  transferred  to  Modiﬁed  Semi-solid
Rappaport-Vassiliadis  agar  (MSRV;  Oxiod,  United  Kingdom)  and
stored  at  42 ◦C  for  24  h.  The  cultures  with  turbid,  grey  matter  were
streaked  on  Xylose  Lysine  Deoxycholate  agar  (XLD;  Oxiod,  United
Kingdom)  and  Brilliant  Green  Phenol  Red  Lactose  Saccharose  agar
(BPLS;  Merck,  Germany)  then  incubated  at  37 ◦C  for  24  h.  Finally,
colonies  presumptively  identiﬁed  as  Salmonella  by  their  black  color,
were  deﬁnitively  identiﬁed  with  biochemical  and  serum  agglutina-
tion  tests.

2.4.  Statistical  analysis

Descriptive  data  regarding  the  Salmonella  positive  prevalence
among  pork  samples  obtained  from  wet  markets  and  supermar-
kets  were  analyzed  using  PHStat®.  Differences  in  Salmonella  spp.
prevalence  among  types  of  market  and  their  odds  ratio  were  ana-
lyzed  using  Fisher’s  exact  test  by  R® version  3.2.1.  If  the  p-values
less  than  0.05,  the  tested  values  are  considered  as  statistically  sig-
niﬁcant  differences.

2.5.  Salmonella  serotyping  and  antimicrobial  susceptibility
testing

Salmonella  isolates  were  serovar  identiﬁed  by  the  WHO   National
Salmonella  and  Shigella  Center  Laboratory  (NSSC),  National  Institute
of  Health,  Department  of  Medical  Science,  Nonthaburi,  Thailand.
All  strains  were  submitted  for  susceptibility  testing  to  a  panel
of  ten  different  antimicrobials  using  agar  disk  diffusion,  follow-
ing  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards  Institute  guidelines  (CLSI,
␮g,
2011).  Antimicrobials  tested  included  ampicillin  (AMP)  10 
␮g,  Chloramphenicol  (C)
amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid  (AUG)  20/10 
␮g,  Nalidixic
30 
␮g,
acid  (NA)  30 

␮g,  Norﬂoxacin  (NOR)  10 

␮g,  Streptomycin  (S)  10 

␮g,  Ciproﬂoxacin  (CIP)  5 

␮g,  Cefotaxime  (CTX)  30 

␮g  and  Tetracy-
Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim  (SXT)  23.75/1.25 
␮g.  In  the  sensitivity  measurements,  Escherichia  coli
cline  (TE)  30 
ATCC® 25922  was  used  as  a  control  strain.  All  strains  that
evidenced  intermediate  resistance  were  combined  with  the  sus-
ceptible  strains  to  avoid  overestimation  of  resistance.

2.6.  Pulsed-ﬁeld  gel  electrophoresis  (PFGE)

PFGE  genotyping  of  Salmonella  was   performed  following  the
Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC)  standardized
PulseNet  protocol  for  Salmonella  as  previously  described  (Ribot
et  al.,  2006),  and  also  completed  by  the  WHO   National  Salmonella
and  Shigella  Center  (NSSC),  National  Institute  of  Health,  Department
of  Medical  Science,  Nonthaburi,  Thailand.  The  PulseNet  “Univer-
sal”  standard  strain  Salmonella  enterica  serovar  Braenderup  H9812
was  used  as  a  reference  marker  and  XbaI  was  used  as  the  digestion
enzyme.  Dendrograms  were  developed  using  BioNumerics  soft-
ware  version  7.1  employing  the  unweighted-pair  group  method
with  arithmetic  means  (UPGMA).  The  2.5%  optimization  values
and  2.5%  band  position  tolerances  were  submitted  to  comparative
analysis.  PFGE  banding  patterns  with  a  similarity  index  >70%  were
classiﬁed  as  being  in  the  same  genotype  cluster.

2.7.  Geographical  distribution  of  Salmonella  strains

The  map   of  the  boundaries  of  Chiang  Mai   and  Lamphun
provinces  as  well  as  the  locations  of  farms,  slaughterhouses  and
markets  was   created  using  QGIS  program  version  2.10  (QGIS
Development  Team,  2015).  The  geographic  locations  of  slaughter-
houses  and  markets  were  precisely  marked  with  a  GPS  device;  the
locations  of  farms  were  plotted  at  the  sub-district  level  due  to  a
lack  of  exact  coordinates.  Strains  of  Salmonella  were  grouped  and
demonstrated  on  each  location  based  on  100%  similarity  threshold
by  PFGE.

3.  Results

Of  all  the  pork  samples  tested,  thirty-four  were  positive  with
Salmonella  (34/82  =  41.5%,  95%  CI:  30.8-52.1%).  Of   the  positive  sam-
ples,  thirty  had  been  acquired  from  wet   markets  (30/41  =  73.2%,  95%
CI:  59.6-86.7%),  while  only  four  Salmonella-positives  samples  were
obtained  from  supermarkets  (4/41  =  9.8%,  95%  CI:  0.1-18.8).  There
was  a  statistically  signiﬁcant  difference  between  the  Salmonella
prevalence  on  Thai  retail  pork  which  originated  from  wet  markets
and  those  which  originated  from  supermarkets  (p  <  0.01),  with  odds
ratio,  25.2  (Table  1).

Twelve  Salmonella  serovars  were  identiﬁed.  S.  Rissen  was  the
−
highest  frequency  found  (36%),  followed  by  S.  I.  4,5,12:  i: 
  (9%)
and  S.  Kedougou  (9%).  However,  two  serovars,  S.  Newport  and  S.
Yoruba,  were  detected  in  only  one  isolate  each  (Fig.  1).

identiﬁed 

Over  80%  of  all  Salmonella  strains 

in  the  study
were  resistant  to  at  least  one  antimicrobial.  The  resistance  of
isolates  was   highest  for  ampicillin  and  tetracycline  (53%)  fol-
lowed  by  streptomycin  (44%)  (Fig.  2).  In  contrast,  no  resistance  to
ciproﬂoxacin,  cefataxime  or  norﬂoxacin  was  detected.  Moreover,
only  one  Salmonella  isolate  identiﬁed  in  this  study  was   resistant  to
amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid.

S.  Weltevreden  (n  =  1)  and  S.  Corvallis  (n  =  1),  were  compared  with
15  other  strains  previously  recovered  from  pig  farms  and  slaugh-
terhouses  in  Chiang  Mai   city  and  surrounding  areas  between  2011
and  2013  (Tadee  et  al.,  2015),  including  S.  Rissen  (n  =  7),  S.  I.  4,5,12:

recovered  from  different  areas  on  the  same  sampling  date  (MM3.2
and  TK1)  as  well  as  those  recovered  during  widely  separated  sam-
pling  periods  (NH2  and  PTK3).  However,  the  two  S.  Rissen  strains
(TP1  and  TP2)  derived  from  TP-market  (TP  is  a  local  market  name)
with  identical  sampling  dates  were  revealed  to  have  distinct  PFGE
patterns.

In  terms  of  geographic  location  analysis,  six  Salmonella  pulso-
types  having  more  than  one  strain  grouping  each  are  displayed
by  original  location  (Fig.  4).  Two  S.  Give  strains  with  an  identical
pulsotype  (MM   3.2  and  TK1)  derived  from  two   markets  located
approximately  2  km  apart  were  identiﬁed.  Furthermore,  Two   S.
Agona  strains  which  share  PFGE  patterns  (NH2  and  PTK3)  were
also  found  at  nearby  sites.  Some  indistinguishable  strains  recovered
from  different  production  levels  were  also  found.  Interestingly,
ﬁve  S.  Rissen  strains  with  matching  pulsotypes  (25/13,  MM3.1,
SO790/12,  SO895/12  and  TP2)  were  recovered  from  farms,  slaugh-
terhouses  and  markets  located  within  a  40  km  radius.

4.  Discussion

The  survey  of  Salmonella  contamination  in  pork  at  the  post-
harvest  stage  in  the  Chiang  Mai   urban  area  between  April  2013
and  September  2014  was  conducted.  An  overall  prevalence  was
41%  (95%  CI:  31–52%).  This  is  not  dissimilar  to  the  29%  (95%  CI:
18–40%)  prevalence  determined  by  Padungtod  and  Kaneene  (2006)
who  surveyed  pork  on  sale  at  markets  throughout  the  provinces
of  Chiang  Mai   and  Lamphun,  Thailand,  and  with  the  40%  (95%  CI:
34–45%)  prevalence  found  on  pork  being  sold  in  northern-Vietnam
(Thai  et  al.,  2012).  The  high  levels  of  Salmonella  contamination  sug-
gest  that  is  there  remains  a  problem  with  the  quality  of  the  pork
being  sold  in  retail  outlets  within  the  Chiang  Mai   study  zone  and
that  this  important  public  health  situation  appears  changed  from
the  study  conducted  a  decade  ago.  Since  the  desired  precision  for
sample  size  determination  in  the  study  is  large  (i.e.  10%)  leading
to  a  small  sample  size  in  the  study,  the  observed  prevalence  of
Salmonella  contamination  in  Chiang  Mai   may   not  be  representative

of  the  infection  prevalence  on  pork  being  sold  in  other  provinces
throughout  Thailand.

Interestingly,  approximate  of  70%  of  the  samples  obtained  from
wet  markets  in  this  study  were  positive  for  Salmonella.  Actually,
Salmonella  can  grow  at  a  wide  range  of  high  temperature.  An
absence  of  cover  materials,  inappropriate  storage  conditions  as  well
as  an  inadequate  disinfection  of  retail  purchasing  areas  during  the
pork  cutting  and  handling  processes  at  wet   markets  can  increase
bacterial  colonizing  activity  (Berends  et  al.,  1998a).  Moreover,  bac-
terial  load  is  redistributed  all  over  the  pork  and  can  proliferate  with
exposure  to  contaminated  equipment  by  knives,  cutting  blocks
and  working  tables  (Berends  et  al.,  1997;  Tadee  et  al.,  2014).  In
contrast,  only  10%  of  supermarket-derived  pork  were  found  to  be
contaminated.  Sealed  packages  with  appropriate  storage  condi-
tions  including  refrigerated  shelves  (i.e.,  below  6 ◦C)  can  reduce  the
occurrence  of  Salmonella  contamination  (Lo  Fo  Wong  et  al.,  2002;
Huang  et  al.,  2015).

Several  serovars  were  identiﬁed  in  this  study,  with  S.  Ris-
sen  being  the  most  commonly  encountered  serovar  at  the  retail
stage.  Moreover,  Rissen  constitutes  a  dominant  serovar  found  in
the  pig  industry  in  the  northern  region  of  Thailand  (Padungtod
and  Kaneene,  2006;  Dorn-In  et  al.,  2009;  Boonkhot  et  al.,  2015),
and  southern-Thailand  (Lertworapreecha  et  al.,  2013).  It  is  also
one  of  the  most  important  serovars  in  humans  in  this  country
(Angkititrakul  et  al.,  2005).  This  situation  is  a  marked  contrast  to
the  studies  conducted  elsewhere  which  have  found  Rissen  to  be  an
uncommon  serovar  in  pig  production,  Irish  retail  pork  (Prendergast
et  al.,  2009).  Besides,  this  serovar  was   not  identiﬁed  at  all  in  pork
purchased  at  the  retail  level  in  Germany  (Schwaiger  et  al.,  2012)  or
in  food  products  in  the  United  States  (Jackson  et  al.,  2013)  as  well
as  in  China  (Cai  et  al.,  2016).  It  is  likely  that  geographical  area  plays
a  role  in  the  differences  in  sero-distribution.  Unusually,  serovars
infrequently  found  in  pork  production  such  as  Corvallis,  Newport
and  Yoruba  were  noticed  in  this  study.  Most  likely,  the  contam-
ination  is  not  introduced  into  the  pig  production  process  from  a
previous  production  stage.  Rather,  shipping  hygiene  as  well  as  san-
itation  and  storage  conditions  at  the  retail  level  might  be  involved

in  the  cross  contamination  (Escartín  et  al.,  1995),  especially  in  wet
markets.  That  is  supported  by  our  ﬁnding  of  greater  Salmonella
prevalence  and  diverse  serovars  at  the  retail  level.

Our  ﬁndings  of  high  resistance  levels  of  strains  to  ampicillin,
tetracycline  and  streptomycin  and  an  absence  of  resistance  to
ciproﬂoxacin,  cefataxime  and  norﬂoxacin  are  similar  to  the  results
of  a  study  by  Tadee  et  al.  (2015)  which  was  recently  carried  out
on  Salmonella  strains  in  the  identical  geographical  area  of  Thailand.
Remarkably,  whereas  various  organisms  are  often  susceptible  to
broad  spectrum  antimicrobials  widely  used  in  human  medicine,
only  one  Salmonella  strain  originating  from  supermarkets  was
resistant  to  amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid.  That  is  an  indicator  that
antimicrobial  resistance  in  livestock  is  becoming  an  increasingly
important  concern  in  human  health  (Marshall  and  Levy,  2011).

Following  the  PFGE  banding  analysis,  some  matching  patterns
of  S.  Rissen  originating  from  pig  farms,  slaughterhouses  and  wet
markets  were  demonstrated.  Clonal  relatedness  of  these  strains  has
been  veriﬁed,  supporting  the  idea  that  pig  is  the  primary  origin  of
Salmonella  contamination,  and  can  spread  this  organism  to  subse-
quent  stages,  the  slaughtering  procedure  as  well  as  the  retail  stage,
by  cross-contamination  (Berends  et  al.,  1998b;  Prendergast  et  al.,
2009;  Hauser  et  al.,  2011).  The  farm-slaughterhouse-retail  contam-
ination  route  has  been  inferred  by  this  study.  Additionally,  groups
of  identical  PFGE  patterns  derived  from  different  locations  were
demonstrated  by  geographical  distribution  mapping.  The  com-
mon   chain  in  pork  production  supplied  by  producers  increases  the
potential  for  organisms  to  spread  over  a  large  area  (Prendergast
et  al.,  2009).  Furthermore,  various  strains  of  Salmonella  were  iden-
tiﬁed  from  the  same  location  on  same  day  and  numerous  new
Salmonella  PFGE  patterns  were  discovered  at  the  retail  stage.
These  ﬁndings  clearly  demonstrate  at  the  molecular  level  that  the
high  risk  for  infection/reinfection  and  cross  contamination  with
Salmonella  in  wet  markets,  butcher  shops  and  supermarkets  has
been  a  great  concern  (Mürmann  et  al.,  2009).

5.  Conclusions

is  conﬁrmed  at  the  molecular 

The  ﬁndings  from  this  study  indicate  Salmonella  is  a  hazard  to
human  health  throughout  the  retail  stage.  Better  hygienic  practices
at  supermarkets  could  reduce  the  chance  of  cross-contamination,
enhancing  domestic  consumer  protection  from  the  organism.  Fur-
thermore,  the  “farm-slaughterhouse-retail”  transmission  route  in
this  study 
level.  Farm  control
programs  should  be  established  with  strict  biosecurity  through
appropriate  management  practices  to  minimize  the  Salmonella
risk  at  the  beginning  of  production  stage.  Continuous  monitoring
and  appropriate  control  measures  during  the  slaughtering  process
should  be  also  promoted.  As  a  ﬁnal  point,  butchers  education  such
as  proper  products  handling,  good  personal  hygienic  practices  as
well  as  adequate  products  storage  conditions  should  be  underlined
at  the  retail  stage,  in  order  to  reduce  contamination  loads  and  to
ensure  product  quality  improvement  to  downstream  consumers.
