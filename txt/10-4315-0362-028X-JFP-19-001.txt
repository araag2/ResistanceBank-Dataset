ABSTRACT

The aim of this study was to determinate the prevalence of Salmonella in retail foods and its resistance to quinolones in
retail foods in Lanzhou, People's Republic of China. In this work, 2,182 food samples, collected from March 2015 to December
2018, were analyzed to detect Salmonella and then analyzed for serotype distribution, quinolone resistance, and quinolone-
resistant gene detection. The ﬁndings demonstrate that the overall prevalence of Salmonella in these food categories was low. A
total of 41 (1.9%) of 2,182 food samples were found to be positive for Salmonella. Ten distinct serovars were identiﬁed, and
Salmonella Derby, Salmonella Anatum, and Salmonella Enteritidis were the most prevalent serovars. According to the broth
microdilution test, the resistance percentages were 90.2% to nalidixic acid, 39.0% to enroﬂoxacin, 41.5% to ciproﬂoxacin,
29.3% to oﬂoxacin, and 26.8% to levoﬂoxacin. Among the quinolone-resistant isolates, 12 strains had a single mutation in gyrA
at codon 83 (Ser!Phe) or codon 87 (Asp!Asn or Asp!Gly). Five isolates had one parC mutation (Ser80!Arg) and one or
two gyrA hot spot mutations. qnr genes were found in seven isolates (ﬁve qnrB and two qnrD), and the aac(60)-Ib gene in seven
isolates. Two isolates carry both qnrB and aac(60)-Ib-cr genes. Based on these results, a low prevalence of Salmonella
contamination in retail foods was found, but it might play a potential risk factor in the spread of quinolone-resistant Salmonella
strains in the Lanzhou region.

Salmonellosis is one of the most widespread foodborne
diseases that is a serious public health problem in many
parts of the world (34, 35). Salmonella is a rod-shaped,
gram-negative bacterium belonging to the Enterobacteria-
ceae family. This genus includes more than 2,600 serovars
the various food sources—
(18, 45).
particularly foods of animal origin, such as pork, beef,
poultry, mutton, egg, and milk—can lead to human
infection (47).

In most cases,

Antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella is still one of
the major global health problems (14, 15). In addition,
multidrug resistance to Salmonella (18, 25) has rapidly
evolved, posing a challenge for chemotherapy treatment and
treatment of certain illnesses (e.g., Salmonella gastroenter-

itis) (28). The increasing prevalence of multidrug resistance
to Salmonella and resistance to clinically important
antibiotics has been an emerging problem in the People's
Republic of China and other countries (24). Therefore, the
severity of multidrug resistance to Salmonella is of
particular concern (1, 31). Antimicrobial-resistant Salmo-
nella emerges from the uncontrolled use of antimicrobial
drugs to treat or to prevent diseases and promote growth in
large-scale animal production, such as poultry, pigs, sheep,
and cattle. These matters have enhanced the need for
epidemiological studies describing the prevalence and
patterns of resistance in Salmonella (21, 27).

In veterinary and human medicine, quinolones, partic-
ularly ﬂuoroquinolones, are generally used for the treatment
of multidrug-resistant Salmonella because of their spectrum
antimicrobial activity in vivo (33). In Salmonella, DNA
gyrase (gyrA and gyrB) and topoisomerase IV gene (parC

and parE) point mutations are directly related to quinolone
resistance. These target genes are called quinolone resis-
tance–determining regions (QRDRs). Various determinants
of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) have
been discovered. It is believed that resistance to quinolones
is mediated by two mechanisms (12). PMQR has three
parts: resistance efﬂux pump (e.g., qepA and oqxAB), qnr
gene families (qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrD, and qnrS), and the
aac(60)-Ib-cr gene (modiﬁed aminoglycoside acetyltrans-
ferase gene) (20). QRDR mutation isolates and PMQR-
positive isolates present a different level of resistance to
quinolones. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of
studying these genes.

Lanzhou is an economic and political center in Gansu
province, located in western China. This area is the core
area of ‘‘One Belt and One Road’’ (a national strategy to
eliminate trade barriers, establish a free-trade area, and
promote investment and trade cooperation between the
countries along the Silk Road); thus, it attracts a range of
tourists and trading partners from around the world. Better
monitoring of public health issues in food production is
needed to reduce the high incidence of Salmonella isolates
in food. There have been several studies on the antimicro-
bial resistance of foodborne Salmonella isolates in China (5,
10, 21, 27, 48), but the lack of data on the prevalence of
Salmonella in the city of Lanzhou led us to undertake this
study. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine
prevalence and contamination levels, serotype distribution,
quinolone resistance, and drug-targeted gene mutations of
Salmonella in different food products obtained in Lanzhou
to obtain data for quantitative risk assessments of
Salmonella in these foods.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Specimen collection and isolate identiﬁcation. From March
2015 to December 2018, 2,182 samples of retail foods were
collected monthly from open-air markets and supermarkets in four
urban area in Lanzhou city. As shown in Table 1, these retail foods
were raw meat (pork, beef, mutton, and chicken), cooked meat

products (roasted meats, sauced meats, and sausages), yogurt, raw
milk, and eggs. Samples were collected within the framework of
the inspection procedures of the food authorities and ofﬁcial
control by the health authorities. Each sample was marked, placed
in a separate sterile tube, and transported to laboratories
immediately in an ice chest.

Isolation of Salmonella was performed using standard
procedures described in a national standard of the People’s
Republic of China (GB/T 4789.4-2003) (29). Speciﬁc steps were
as follows: each sample (25 g of solids and 5 mL of liquid) was
placed in a separate sterile shaker ﬂask and washed with 225 mL
of buffered peptone water with vigorous shaking for 5 min. The
rinse was incubated at 378C in a water bath with shaking at 200
rpm for 8 h, and then 10 mL of buffered peptone water was added
to 100 mL of selenite cystine broth at 378C for 16 to 24 h. A loop
of inoculum from the selenite cystine broth was streaked onto
Salmonella-Shigella agar or xylose lysine deoxycholate agar
(CHROMagar, Shanghai, China) and incubated for 16 to 24 h at
378C. Presumptive strains were picked from each plate by testing
in triple sugar iron and lysine-iron agar slants and incubated for 16
to 24 h at 368C. Isolates with typical Salmonella phenotypes were
conﬁrmed using API 20E test strips (bioMerieuxVitek, Marcy
l’Etoile, France). Salmonella isolates were stored in Luria-Bertani
broth containing 10% glycerol at  808C until used.

Serotyping. All Salmonella isolates were serotyped by the
slide agglutination method using commercial O and H antisera
(Difco, BD, Detroit, MI), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Antimicrobial suscep-
tibility was evaluated using the broth microdilution method and
according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guide-
lines (7). As quality control, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was
tested in each run. This test was performed using representatives
of the quinolone class for veterinary therapeutic use, such as
nalidixic acid (NAL), ciproﬂoxacin (CIP), enroﬂoxacin (ENO),
oﬂoxacin (OFL), and levoﬂoxacin (LVX). The isolates were
classiﬁed as susceptible or resistant according to the interpretative
standards recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (7).

PCR ampliﬁcation and DNA sequencing. All isolates were
analyzed using PCR assays for the QRDRs of gyrA, gyrB, parC,
and parE (17, 38, 43, 49) and PMQR determinants (qnrA, qnrB,
qnrD, qnrS, and aac(60)-Ib-cr). The primers have been described
in previous studies (11, 32, 38, 43, 47). To prepare genomic DNA,
the bacterial suspension was collected and heated at 1008C for 10
min and then incubated on ice for 10 min. The samples were then
centrifuged (Thermo Pico17, Thermo Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA) at
13,800 3 g for 5 min. The supernatants were collected and stored
at 48C until further use. The QRDRs genes were ampliﬁed by PCR
under the following cycling conditions: 5 min for predenaturation
at 958C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 958C, 30 s at an annealing
temperature of 568C, a 30-s extension at 728C, and a ﬁnal
extension step of 10 min at 728C. The PMQR genes were
ampliﬁed by PCR performed under the following conditions: one
cycle of predenaturation at 958C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles
at 958C for 30 s; annealing at 548C for qnrA and qnrB; annealing at
568C for qnrD and qnrS and at 568C for aac(60)-Ib-cr for 30 s; an
extension at 728C for 30 s; and a ﬁnal extension at 728C for 10
min. All PCR products were sequenced by the Nanjing Genscript
Biology Co. Sequence data were then analyzed by DNA Star, and
the sequences were compared with reference sequences from the
National Center for Biotechnology Information’s GenBank.

Statistical analysis. The chi-square test was used for data
analysis using SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL), and a P
value less than 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.

RESULTS

Prevalence and serotyping of Salmonella in retail
food products. Table 1 shows the prevalence of Salmonella
in various food categories in Lanzhou from March 2015 to
December 2018. A total of 2,182 food samples were taken
from the Lanzhou food industry and at the retail level.
During this 4-year period, 41 (1.9%) of 2,182 food samples
were found to be positive for Salmonella. The annual
overall prevalence of Salmonella-positive food samples
differed signiﬁcantly (P , 0.05) between years compared
with 2018, varying between 0.9 and 2.5% yearly. The
overall 4-year prevalence of Salmonella in raw meat
products was 3.5% in the 949 investigated food samples

and 0.5% in the 536 analyzed cooked meat samples.
Salmonella was isolated from raw eggs (positive investi-
gated samples, 2.3%), raw pork (3.6%), raw beef (2.7%),
raw mutton (2.9%), raw chicken (4.4%), roasted meats
(1.2%), and sauced meats (0.5%). All sausage, yogurt, and
raw milk were Salmonella negative from 2015 to 2018. In
the Salmonella
short,
prevalence was signiﬁcantly (P , 0.05) lower in some
food categories than the 4-year mean prevalence in that
category (Table 1).

in some single years (2018),

Ten serovars were identiﬁed among the 41 isolates, and
1 isolate from the mutton samples was untypeable (Table 2).
The top ﬁve serovars were Salmonella Derby (n ¼ 11,
26.8%), Salmonella Anatum (n ¼ 7, 17.1%), Salmonella
Enteritidis (n ¼ 7, 17.1%), Salmonella Typhimurium (n ¼ 5,
12.2%), and Salmonella Senftenberg (n ¼ 5, 12.2%).
Salmonella London was detected only in mutton samples.

Antimicrobial susceptibility. Among these 41 iso-
lates, 4 isolates were sensitive to all
tested quinolones
(including NAL), 17 (41.5%) isolates were resistant to CIP,
16 (39.0%) isolates were resistant to ENO, 12 (29.3%)
isolates were resistant to OFL, and 11 (26.8%) isolates were
resistant to LVX in the broth microdilution test. A total of
37 (90.2%) isolates were resistant to NAL (data not shown).
The broth microdilution test identiﬁed 58.5% (24 of 41) of
isolates with decreased susceptibility to CIP (MICs between
0.125 and 0.5 mg/mL), 60.9% (25 of 41) with decreased
susceptibility to ENO, 70.7% (29 of 41) with decreased
susceptibility to OFL, and 73.2% (30 of 41) with decreased
susceptibility to LVX (MICs between 0.25 and 1 mg/mL).
The resistance proﬁle obtained with the microdilution test
showed that 11 (26.8%) isolates were resistant to all tested
quinolones, 4 (9.7%) were resistant to CIP and NAL, 4

Analysis of QRDR mutation and detection of
PMQR. According to antimicrobial susceptibility, 21
isolates of Salmonella were selected for detection of the
QRDR mutation (gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE) and PMQR.
The distributions of QRDR gene mutations and PMQR are
listed in Table 3. Eight isolates had wild-type gyrA, gyrB,
parC, and parE. Twelve isolates had a single mutation in
gyrA at codon 83 (Ser!Phe) or codon 87 (Asp!Asn or
Asp!Gly). Five isolates had one parC mutation
(Ser80!Arg) and one or two gyrA hot spot mutations
(Table 3). None of the mutations presented in the gyrB and
parE genes. The detection of resistance genes showed seven
isolates carrying the aac(60)-Ib-cr gene, ﬁve carrying the
qnrB gene, and two carrying the qnrD gene. Among these,
11 isolates were resistant to all tested quinolones; 6 strains
were recovered from chicken samples, 2 were recovered
from egg samples, 2 were recovered from pork samples, and
1 was recovered from mutton samples. The most prevalent
qnr-positive serovars were Salmonella Typhimurium and
Salmonella Enteritidis. None of the isolates presented the
qnrA, qnrC, and qnrE genes. Seven gyrA mutation-positive
and qnr-positive isolates presented the aac(60)-Ib-cr gene in
association (Table 3): three Salmonella Typhimurium, three
Salmonella Enteritidis, and one Salmonella Derby.

pathogens, particularly Salmonella.
is possible for
resistant bacteria from animals to be transmitted to a human
subject. Surveillance of the resistance rates among food-
borne pathogens of animal-based retail foods is clearly
important in management and risk assessment.

In the present study, 41 (1.9%) Salmonella-positive
samples were recovered from 2,182 retail food products in
Lanzhou, China. This result was similar to previous reports
showing Salmonella occurrence of 2.32% in 2000 (40),
3.32% in 2001, 3.55% in 2002 (39), 2.2% in 2014 (26), and
3.5% in 2016 (47) but lower than results from retail foods in
Shaanxi province (9.6% (36)) and cooked meat products in
Henan province (9.0% (48)). This rate is signiﬁcantly lower
than the prevalence of Salmonella in food products reported
from other provinces in China, which was 20.9% in Hebei
province (5), 36.8% in Shaanxi province (46), and 27.8% in
Sichuan province (27). Salmonella in retail food products
was at a low or negative level in some areas of China (6,
42). No Salmonella was isolated from yogurt, in agreement
with previous reports (45).

In this study, 10 serovars were isolated from retail
foods, dominated by Salmonella Derby (26.8%), Salmonella
Anatum (17.1%), Salmonella Enteritidis (17.1%), Salmo-
nella Typhimurium (12.2%), and Salmonella Senftenberg
(12.2%). Among them, Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmo-
nella Anatum were the most common serovars isolated from

common serovar isolated from pork samples, and untype-
able serovars were isolated from mutton samples. In China,
a previous study reported that Salmonella Senftenberg and
Salmonella Anatum were the common serovar from cooked
meat products in Henan province; Salmonella Derby and
Salmonella Enteritidis were also detected (48). Another
previous study reported that Salmonella Derby, Salmonella
Meleagridis, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Salmonella Senf-
tenberg were the dominant serovars from retail foods in
China (47). Other countries report Salmonella as well. In
Thailand, Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Derby
were isolated as common serovars from retail foods (2). In
Estonia, only Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Infantis
were isolated as common serovars from retail foods (22). In
Myanmar, Salmonella Albany, Salmonella Kentucky, Sal-
monella Braenderup, and Salmonella Indiana were isolated
as common serovars from retail foods (30). In Brazil, 26
Salmonella serovars were identiﬁed. Salmonella Typhimu-
rium was the predominant serovar, followed by Salmonella
Enteritidis and Salmonella Muenchen (33). However,
Salmonella Derby, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Salmonella
Anatum were the commonly identiﬁed serovars in the
present study. In addition, these common serovars were
frequently observed in clinical Salmonella in China,
suggesting an association between Salmonella food poison-
ing and salmonellosis (24, 47).

In the current study, Salmonella isolated from cooked
meat showed a lesser degree of quinolone resistance than
that from other samples, whereas Salmonella isolated from
chicken and egg showed a greater degree of quinolone
resistance than that from other samples (Table 3). It was
observed that 11 isolates—4 Salmonella Typhimurium, 3
Salmonella Derby, and 4 Salmonella Enteritidis isolates—
exhibited resistance to CIP, NAL, ENO, LVX, and OFL.
These strains are of particular clinical concern, because
quinolones are drugs of choice for treating salmonellosis
(10, 44). This ﬁnding reveals that these strains would not be
disrupted by all commonly used antimicrobial agents during
therapy, which indicates a potentially serious impact on
human health. These ﬁndings may not be surprising, Since
the 1980s, a large number of quinolones have been used
broadly in veterinary medicine in China (12, 18, 35).
Previous research showed that Salmonella was primary in
chickens and has been speciﬁcally resistant to quinolones
since 2000 (39).

in the gyrA gene,

The main mechanisms of quinolone resistance in
Salmonella have been attributed to several point mutations
in the QRDR genes (gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE) and the
PMQR genes. In Salmonella, similar to other bacteria
species, the hot spot mutations associated with resistance to
quinolones occur
resulting from
substitutions of Ser83 with Tyr, Ala, or Phe and of Asp87
with Tyr, Gly, or Asn (13). For E. coli (16), Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (4), Riemerella anatipestifer (36), and Actino-
bacillus pleuropneumoniae (41), mutations of QRDR at
different sites affect
levels of resistance to
quinolone, and coinstantaneous mutations in gyrA and parC
genes produce high levels of quinolone resistance. In the
present study, we found that
two isolates had double

to different

mutations (Ser83!Phe or Asp87!Asn) in the gyrA gene
and nine isolates had a single mutation (Asp87!Asn or
Asp87!Gly) in the gyrA gene. For parC, ﬁve resistant
strains had a mutation at Ser80!Arg, and there are one or
two gyrA hot spot mutations. In agreement with previous
studies, multiple mutants generally had higher MICs than
mutants with a single mutation in the QRDR (3, 9, 12).

In many previous studies, the qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, qnrD,
and aac(6 0)-Ib-cr PMQR had decreasing or
limiting
susceptibility to quinolone (13, 16, 20). In this study, we
found a high prevalence of isolates carrying PMQR genes
(29.2%, 12 of 41). The most prevalent serovars associated
with the presence of PMQR genes were Salmonella
Typhimurium (4 of 12) and Salmonella Enteritidis (4 of
12). Two isolates presented an association between qnrB
and aac(60)-Ib-cr genes. A similar study has been reported
by Park et al. (32) in the United States. Consistent with
these ﬁndings, Xu et al. (44) investigated qnr and aac(60)-Ib
genes in Enterobacter cloacae in China. Kim et al. (19)
studied enterobacterium isolated from clinical samples in
Korea, and Pribul et al. (33) studied Salmonella isolates
from the food chain in Brazil. The qnrB, qnrD, and aac(60)-
Ib-cr genes have been reported to be widely distributed
among intestinal bacteria. Consequently, all these Salmo-
nella-positive retail food products represented a high risk
for the consumers (8, 19). Therefore, the Chinese food
safety management should implement further surveillance
for

food products.

retail

In conclusion, our study is the ﬁrst report of the
prevalence of Salmonella in retail food products in Lanzhou
city. Diversity was observed in the isolated serotypes, with
Salmonella Derby, Salmonella Anatum, and Salmonella
Enteritidis as the predominant serotypes. High resistance to
quinolone was detected. The quinolone resistance of poultry
products is particularly serious, indicating that numerous
antimicrobial agents commonly used in chicken are
ineffective. We also found that several hot spot mutations
associated with resistance to quinolones occur in the gyrA
and parC gene, and a high prevalence of isolates carrying
PMQR genes was detected. The increased detection of
QRDR mutation and PMQR in Salmonella, is a serious
problem in public health and must be monitored constantly.
This information may provide useful data for the develop-
ment of public health policies and effective strategies to
ensure the security of China’s food products.
