Healthy lambs are one of the major reservoirs of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and it is known as
the cause of foodborne diseases (FBD). The work objective is to characterize (STEC) isolates obtained from rectal
swabs of healthy lambs herds, a total of 183 samples were obtained from sheep production units of the State of
Mexico. E. coli isolates were conﬁrmed through the ampliﬁcation of the uid A gene. antimicrobial sensitivity
pattern was determined through Kirby-Bauer (CLSI, 2012) test and the presence stx1, stx2 and eae genes from
isolates by multiplex PCR. Serotyping was performed using speciﬁc anti-O and anti-H sera (SERUNAM, Mexico)
for 185 Somatic and 56 ﬂagellar antigens. 126 isolates biochemically and molecularly identiﬁed as E. coli were
obtained, of which 80 did not express any virulence factor and 46 expressed at least some (STEC) virulence
factor. The highest percentage of E. coli resistance was for tetracycline 48.7% (39/80), followed by nalidixic acid
13.7% (11/80), gentamicin 6.2% (5/80) and Ciproﬂoxacin 3.7% (3/80). Resistance to amikacin, cefotaxime and
ceftazidime were not detected. A frequency of 46 STEC isolates (36.2%) were obtained, of which 28/46 (22.0%)
expressed stx1, stx2 3/46 (6.5%), stx1, stx2 13/46 (10.2%) and eae 2/46 (1.6%). Thirty diﬀerent serotypes were
obtained. The three serotypes with the highest number of isolates (four each) were: O76:H19, O118:H27 and
O146:H21 which have been identiﬁed as a cause of diarrhea in human population. An isolate of serogroup O104
was obtained, with a signiﬁcant importance for European public health. In virtue of the discovered serotypes and
the virulence factors distribution, we can aﬃrm that the obtained isolates from lambs in the State of Mexico are
classiﬁable as atypical STEC of low virulence.

1. Introduction

STEC strains are normal inhabitants of the ruminant gastrointestinal
tract (bovine, sheep and goats) (Nataro and Kaper, 1998) and are the
cause of foodborne diseases (FBDs) of animal and vegetable origin
(Blanco et al., 2003; Caprioli et al., 2005).

E.coli O157:H7 has been reported in lambs and sheep; both isolated
from stool, sheep meat products and byproducts (Kumar et al., 2012;
Momtaz et al., 2012), on the other hand serotypes Non-O157, as OR26,
O111, O103, O121, O45 and O145 have been found in calves and sheep
and identiﬁed as potential public health risk factors (Evans et al., 2008;
Bai et al., 2012). The most common pathotypes causing diarrhea in
sheep in Mexico as EPEC (Enteropathogenic E. coli) and ETEC (Enter-

otoxigenic E.coli). (Méndez et al., 2013; Rangel-Vargas et al., 2015).

The phenomenon of antibiotic resistance in commensal and patho-
genic bacteria has become a serious problem in public health (Saei
et al., 2010), bacteriás development and persistence is a topic of global
concern since these microorganisms are considered as a resistance
genes reservoir, capable of
transferring resistance genes to their
oﬀspring, and other organisms that cause foodborne diseases and
zoonotic diseases (Zhang et al., 2002).

STEC strains can cause severe diseases in the human population as
the Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and Hemorrhagic Colitis (HC)
(Paton and Paton, 1998a). The shiga toxins 1 and 2 and its variants are
the main virulence factors of this microorganism. In addition to toxins,
STEC denominated strains possess other pathogenicity mechanisms that

allow the phenomena of attaching and eﬀacing (A/E) as the eae
chromosomal gene that encodes the outer membrane protein (OMP)
of 94 kDa, called intimin (Paton and Paton 1998b).

Various investigations have revealed the existence of variants for
both shiga toxins; the stx1 gene has 3 subtypes (stx1a, stx 1c and stx1d)
(Zhang et al., 2002; Burk et al., 2003) and numerous stx2 gene variants
have been described (stx2a, stx2b, stx2c, stx2d, stx2e, stx2f, and stx2g)
letting the stx2a, stx2c and stx2d variants the most linked to the
presentation of HUS (Piérard et al., 1998; Schmidt et al., 2000). Also
exists a speciﬁc plasmid, which encodes hemolysin (ehxA) production
that can contribute to the virulence of this type of microorganisms for
the human population (Beutin et al., 1995; Schetuz and Strockbine,
2005).

The STEC serotype O157:H7 is commonly associated with the
presence of HUS and HC in the human population, not solely more
than 100 diﬀerent serotypes associated with these suﬀering aﬄictions
have been recognized (Nguyen and Sperandio, 2012). Its noteworthy
mentioning, the STEC Non-O157 report which do not cause SHU and
HC in Europe, Australia and Asia attributed to diﬀerent serotypes as
O5:NM (immobile), O6:H11, O26:NM, O48:H21, O91:NM, O111:NM,
O113:H21, O128:H2 and O128:NM. Two of these serotypes (O11:NM
and O26:H11) may also cause diarrhea to weaned calves (Goldwater
and Bettelheim, 1995; Russmann et al., 1995; Achenson and Keusch,
1996).

In Mexico, few studies have been conducted to determine the
presence of STEC strains and their virulence factors in cattle carcass,
sheep and feces of domestic animals. Amézquita-López et al. (2014)
found 12.5% prevalence of STEC, 5.4% of isolates were O157 and 7.1%
of isolates were No-O157, in feces of healthy domestic animals (cattle,
sheep, pigs and poultry) of small rural farms in the valley of Culiacan
northwestern Mexico. Cuenca-Verde et al. (2013) found 26% preva-
lence of STEC No-O157 in feces of healthy sheep in one techniﬁed farm
in Jalisco, Mexico. Callaway et al. (2004) found 3.3% prevalence of
STEC O157:H7 isolated from pigs in the center of Mexico and Narvaez-
Bravo et al. (2013) reported 23.2% prevalence of STEC O157:H7
isolated from feces of cattle and bovine animal carcasses in slaughter-
houses. The objective of this research is to characterize STEC isolates
and its frequency in healthy lambs in the State of Mexico.

2. Materials and methods

Sampling and bacteriological isolation

Sample size was estimated using the formula for ﬁnite populations
(Wayne, 1991) with 20% E. coli prevalence (Mora et al., 2005). 183
rectal swabs samples were collected from healthy lambs without
diarrhea of 1–6 months age during the months of February to May
2014, from eight sheep production units located in six municipalities of
the State of Mexico by convenience sampling. Samples were transferred
to the Center for Investigation and Advanced Studies in Animal Health
of the Autonomous University of the State of Mexico (CIESA-UAEMex).
Samples were inoculated in agar Mc-Conkey (SMAC, Beckton
Dickinson, USA). After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, pink colored
colonies were plated on eosin-methylene blue agar (EMB) (SMAC,
Beckton Dickinson, USA) to observe the metallic luster characteristic,
Finally the following biochemical tests by manitol fermentation test,
TSI, LIA, MIO, H2S, indole production and presence of urease and lysine
decarboxylase. Furthermore, sorbitol fermentation was tested (Fig. 1).

2.1. Genotypic identiﬁcation

To corroborate isolates identity, genotypic identiﬁcation through
uid A gene ampliﬁcation is proceeded in principle to extract the isolates'
bacterial DNA, for which isolates were inoculated in 3 ml of BHI broth
(HiMedia, USA) that were and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. With a
micropipette, 1.0 ml of culture was taken and deposited in a 1.5 mL vial

subsequently centrifuged for 5 min at 9279 g (Eppendorf Centrifuge
5415D., USA), supernatant was discarded and 400 μl of distilled water
were added to pellet, then vortexed during 30 s (Scientiﬁc Industries
Inc. USA), then centrifuged for 5 min. at 9279 g, supernatant was
discarded and 100 μl of distilled water was added,
then boiled
(95 °C–100 °C) during 15 min ﬁnally was slightly centrifuged and
supernatant removed to be stored at −20 °C (Reyes-Rodríguez et al.,
2015) until its use. For uid A gene ampliﬁcation the following primers
UAL1939 B 5′ ATGGAATTTCGCCGATTTTGC 3′ and UAL 2105 B 5′AT-
TGTTTGCCTCCCTGCTGC 3′ were used, with an ampliﬁcation product
of 187 bp previously designed and evaluated by Heijnen and Medema
(2006).

2.2. Antimicrobial susceptibility test

The antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed through a disk diﬀu-
sion test
standardized by the National Committee for Clinical
Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). E. coli ATCC 25922 strain was used as
control bacterial inoculum of each isolate was prepared in test tubes
with Mueller Hinton broth medium (MH) (SMAC, Beckton Dickinson,
USA). With turbidity pattern of 0.5 at McFarland scale which approxi-
mately equivalent
(CFU).
Ceftriaxone (30 μg), ceftazidime (30 μg), Tetracycline (30 μg), nalidixic
acid (30 μg), ciproﬂoxacin (5 μg), amikacin (10 μg) and gentamicin
(10 μg) disks were used in susceptibility test (BBL™ Sensi-Disc™ Becton
Dickinson. USA).

colony forming units

to 1–2 × 108

2.3. Virulence factors

The 126 isolates that ampliﬁed uid A gene were analyzed by
multiplex PCR, for the presence of stx1, stx2 and eae. Using the primers
and conditions described by (Blanco et al., 2003) (Table 1). PCR
products were visualized by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel stained
with ethidium bromide.

2.4. Serotyping

46 E.coli isolates were serotyped through the expression of some
virulence factor and carried out according to the procedure described
by Orskov and Orskov (1984). The O antisera were produced in the
reference laboratory for enteric pathogens in Mexico (SERUNAM,
Mexico) for 185 Somatic, and the H antisera for 56 ﬂagellar antigens,
and were obtained from the Statens Serum Institut (Copenhagen,
Denmark).

3. ERIC PCR

The ampliﬁcation of bacterial DNA was performed in a ﬁnal volume
of 50 μl containing 10 μl buﬀer, 6.0 μl Mg Cl2, 1.0 μl dNTPs, (dNTP
Mix, Promega®, USA U151A) (200 μM of each dNTP) 1.0 μl ERIC 1
(IDT®. USA Mfg. D 173852411), 1.0 μl ERIC 2 (IDT®. USA Mfg. D
173852410), 0.5 μl Taq Polymerase, 27.5 μl free nuclease water and
3.0 μl DNA of each sample. The PCR tests were carried out Termo BIO-
Rad T100 Thermal Cycler. USA, under the following conditions: initial
denaturation of 5 min at 94 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C
(denaturation), 1 min at 52 °C (alignment) and 1 min at 74 °C (elonga-
tion) and ﬁnal extension of 6 min at 74 °C (Soler et al., 2003).
ERIC-PCR product were displayed using 7 μl reaction product added
to 3 μl loading buﬀer (Blue Orange 6X Loading Type PROMEGA. USA).
Electrophoresis was conducted through 1.5% agarose gel in TBE Buﬀer
(89 mM Tris, 89 mM boric acid y 2.5 mM EDTA) and ran for 60 min at
74 V. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide (0.05 mg/L) and was
placed in an ultraviolet transilluminator (Mini BIS Pro Biol-Imaging
Sytem Uv. USA) for their observation.

A variance analysis was established for antibiotics resistance results
between STEC and non STEC isolates. The virulence factors results were
analyzed by descriptive statistics sorting data in tables.

4. Results

Regarding a total of 183 samples of the obtained rectal swabs, 126
isolates were conﬁrmed by the ampliﬁcation of the uid A gene, which
determines an E. coli isolate frequency of 68.8%. (Table 2). Of 126
isolates, 46 expressed at least one of the studied virulence factors and
were serotyped, while 80 did not express any of the studied virulence
factors both isolates that expressed some or any virulence factor were
subjected to in vitro sensitivity test (p > 0.05). (Table 3).

Concerning E. coli antimicrobial resistance, the greatest resistance
percentage was observed for tetracycline (TE) with 48.7% (39/80)
followed by the nalidixic acid (NA) with 13.7% (11/80), gentamicin
(GE) 6.2% (5/80), ciproﬂoxacin (CIP) 3.7% (3/80). Amikacin ceftriax-
one and ceftazidime did not present any resistance.

In 17/46 STEC isolates that expressed phenotypic resistance,
tetracycline was the antibiotic with the largest number of resistant
strains with 70.7% (12/17), nalidixic acid 47.7% (8/17), gentamicin
11.7% (2/17), amikacin 11.7% (2/17), ciproﬂoxacin, ceftazidime and
cefotaxime did not presented any resistance (Table 3). It was observed
that 6 STEC isolates with diﬀerent serotypes and virulence genes
expression proﬁle, expressed phenotypic resistance to more than one
antibiotic (Table 4).

46 isolates expressed some virulence genes 36.5% (126/46), of
which: 28 (22.2%) expressed stx1, 3 expressed stx2 (2.3%), 13 expressed
both stx1 and stx2 (10.3%) and two isolates expressed eae (1.5%)
(Table 4).

STEC isolates belonged to 19 diﬀerent serogroups O and 30 diﬀerent
serotypes O:H. 68% of the isolates belonged to one of the following ﬁve
serogroups: O8, O76, O118,O146, O153, O176, O185 and O187, 39.1%
of
the isolates belonged to the following serotypes: O76:H19,
O118:H27, O146:H21, O176:NM and O187:H28. (Table 4)

Forty percent of the isolates belonged to O79:H19, O118:H27 and
O146:H21 serotypes (4 isolates/serotype). The 20% of the isolates
belonged to O176:NM and O187:H21 serotypes(3 isolates/serotype)
(Table 4).

Its noteworthy mentioning the presence of O104:H7, O146:H21,
O76:H19, and ONT:H21 serotypes causing diarrhea in humans.
(Table 4)

ERIC-PCR was realized to evaluate the clonal relationship between
isolates that expressed some virulence factor, 44/46 STEC
E. coli
isolates showed a 95.6% of genetic diversity. Only two isolates obtained
from male lambs, of the same production unit were sensitive to all used
antibiotics and showed the same bands pattern through the expression
of stx1 gene, which could mean a same clonal proﬁle. Only varied in
serotype expression, one expressed O176:H19 serotype and the other

5. Discussion

The constant monitoring of the antibiotics used in animal husbandry
is relevant to determine the presence and prevalence of resistant strains
that potentially can be a risk factor for human health (Schroeder et al.,
2002).

With regard to the E.coli isolates antibiotics resistance, in this
research we found a resistance to tetracycline of 48.7%, followed by
nalidixic acid 13.7%, gentamicin 6.2% and ﬁnally ciproﬂoxacin with
3.7%, amikacin, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone did not present phenotypic
resistance. In Ontario province, Canada, 2012, reported 12% resistance
to tetracycline and 100% sensitivity to ciproﬂoxacin and amikacin and
nalidixic acid for E. coli isolates from sheep ﬂocks (Scott et al., 2012).

44

Scott, relates the resistance level of tetracycline to its inappropriate use
in diets and drinking water that could be a risk factor to animal and
human population.

In Argentina Pantozzi et al. (2010) found in sheep E.coli isolates
with a resistance of 21.0% to tetracycline, with similar reports for
ceftriaxone of 5.3%. Regarding gentamicin, amikacin, ciproﬂoxacin and
nalidixic acid, no resistance was reported. Novotna et al. (2005) in
Jordan, single strain resistant to tetracycline was reported, with a
percent well below the 39 isolates reported in the present investigation
under diﬀerent geographic and productive conditions.

In Spain sheep E.coli isolates, a resistance of 26.3% to nalidixic acid
a little higher than what reported in the present work. (Orden et al.,
2000). Blanco et al. (1996) in VTEC sheep isolates (Extremadura region,
Spain), where the climatic conditions are diﬀerent presented resistance
percentages to tetracycline 76.0% higher than what reported in our
study, although it remains the antibiotic with the highest resistance
percentage. Respecting gentamicin, the percent was similar to what
estimated in this study, and for nalidixic acid, Blanco reported 6%, a
lower percent than the reported in this study.

In this research, STEC isolates were reported with phenotypic
expression resistant
to tetracycline 70.7%, nalidixic acid 47.1%,
gentamicin 11.7%, amikacin 11.7%, regarding ciproﬂoxacin, ceftriax-
one and ceftazidime no phenotypic resistance was reported. In addition,
a phenotypic expression resistance was observable for more than one
antibiotic, where four isolates expressed resistance to tetracycline-
nalidixic acid, one isolate to tetracycline-gentamicin and one isolate
to tetracycline-gentamicin-nalidixic acid.

A work realized in Brazil with sheep STEC isolates of Dorper race, in
tropical conditions (Ferreira et al., 2015) reported a lower percent for
gentamicin 4.5% and highest resistance for tetracycline antibiotic with
12.2%, a percent lower than the reported in this research. Ferreira et al.
(2015) were able to detect resistance to ceftazidime with a 5.6%, in
comparison with the present study where no cephalosporin resistance
was reported, lastly, Ferreira et al. (2015) reported a 1.1% resistance
for amikacin.

In an investigation carried out in the Valley of Culiacán, Sinaloa
with healthy backyard sheep Amézquita-López et al., (2016) reported
STEC isolates, with resistance to amikacin, gentamicin and tetracycline,
also reported isolates with serotype O146:H21 resistant to cephalospor-
in, in the present work we obtained the same serotype but with
resistance to nalidixic acid.
to mention that
Amézquita-López et al. (2016) reported in Mexico resistance to more
than one antibiotic cephalothin-chloramphenicol, cephalothin-Genta-
micin, Ampicillin-cephalothin-tetracycline,
ampicillin-cephalothin-
chloramphenicol-tetracycline in STEC O157 and No-O157 isolates.

In the USA (Edrington et al., 2009) reported resistance to more than
one antibiotic in O157:H7 isolates obtained from lambs, reported two
isolates resistant to two antibiotics and an insolate resistant to eight
antibiotics.

In the present investigation we were able to ﬁnd a 36.5% (46/126)
of STEC isolates. The resistance percentage was similar to the one
reported in India, 32% of
isolates obtained from lambs under a
transhumance system (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2011), in Iran 36.8%
(Tahamtman and Namavari et al., 2014), in Spain 35% in healthy lambs
(Rey et al., 2003), in Australia 31% (Djordjevic et al., 2001) and in New
Zealand 48% of STEC in lambs (Cookson et al., 2006).

There are reports of STEC slightly lower than that reported in this
study, in Mexico 26% from healthy sheeps (Cuenca-Verde et al., 2013).
In India reported 24.1% of STEC presentation in lambs with and
without diarrhea (Wani et al., 2009), also in India, 24% found in
lamb’s samples (Kumar et al., 2012). In Iran, a research established with
healthy sheep 22.4% (Ghanbarpour and Kiani, 2013) and in China
reported a STEC percent bit less of 19.8% in healthy sheep (Gu et al.,
2011).

In this investigation stx1 gene was reported as the virulence factor
with the highest presentation frequency of 22.2%, followed by stx1-stx2

10.3%, stx2 2.3%, regarding eae gene this paper shows a frequency of
1.5%. There are diﬀerent investigations carried out for STEC detection
around the world which is also considered as the distribution pattern of
the virulence stx1, stx2 and eae genes, which coincide with the present
study (Blanco et al., 2003; Brett et al., 2003; Zweifel et al., 2004; Wani
et al., 2009; Cookson et al., 2006; Cuenca-Verde et al., 2013; Tahatman
and Namavari, 2014; Ferreira et al., 2015) where stx1 presented the
greater virulence factor percentage of all isolates followed by stx1-2,
then stx2 and ﬁnally eae. In case of eae gene, this study reported similar
results to those reported in Switzerland (Zweifel et al., 2001), Spain
(Rey et al., 2003) and India (Bhat et al., 2008).

These data suggest that the reported isolates when not expressing

the stx1, stx2 and eae genes together, could be named atypical STEC and
thus of low virulence, however, continue representing a risk factor to
public health, since isolates have been reported lacking the expression
of eae gene as a cause of diarrhea in humans (Strockbine et al., 1997;
Nataro and Kaper 1998; Kumar et al., 2004).

In this research, an isolate of serotype O104:H7 with expression of
stx1 gene was detected, belonging to O104 serogroup. This serogroup
gained more importance since it introduced a severe outbreak of
hemolytic uremic syndrome in Germany in 2011 attributed to
O104:H4 serotype present in products with plant origin, possibly water
was contaminated with residues of ruminant’s feces (Mora et al., 2011;
Duﬀy et al., 2014).

Another diarrhea causing STEC serotype in human population is
O146:H21, in this investigation four isolates are reported with expres-
sion of stx1 and stx2 genes. Researches in other countries reported this
same serotype from healthy adult sheep and lambs, in Spain (Blanco
et al., 2003; Rey et al., 2003; Mora et al., 2005); Mexico (Cuenca-Verde
et al., 2013 Amézquita-López et al., 2014), Brazil (Vettorato et al.,
2009) and Norway (Urdahl et al., 2001) isolates from healthy adult
sheep and lambs. Serotypes O104:H7 and O146:H21 along with
O76:H19 serotype (with expression of stx1 gene) and ONT:H21 (with
expression of stx1 gene) found in this study are responsible for cases of
diarrhea in humans in Mexico; which makes these serotypes,
in
particular, a possible risk factor for public health (Eslava et al., 1994).
With regard to ERIC-PCR study, 44 of the 46 isolates showed
diﬀerent bands patterns, only two isolates showed similar bands
patterns, which suggest a same clonal proﬁle; these two isolates possess
the same resistance pattern to the used antibiotics, expressing stx1 gene
and belonged to the same serogroup, diﬀer only in the ﬂagellar H
antigen expression, the isolate 008 C16 express O176:H19 serotype,
while 008 C2 isolate express O176:H̄ serotype. This can be explained by
the variation in H antigen expression of the phase variation phenom-
enon (Stainer et al., 1994), which explains that some E. coli isolates
have two genetic determinants sets for diﬀerent ﬂagellar antigens,
susceptible to alternation regarding its phenotypic expression, as
bacteria multiply. Presenting with a certain probability, the variant
ﬂiC H19 ﬂagellar gene is responsible for this variation, because it is
responsible for proteins polymerization, forming bacterial ﬂagellar
ﬁlaments (Osek and Gallien, 2002).

6. Conclusions

The STEC isolates frequency was 36.5% (46/126), no signiﬁcant
statistically diﬀerence was observed for antibiotics resistance among
E.coli isolates and STEC. It was not able to detect isolates with the stx1,
stx2 and eae genes expression simultaneously, through which STEC
isolates fell into low virulence atypical STEC category. STEC isolates
with serotypes that cause diarrhea in humans were detected with
importance to Mexican public health,
like O146:H21, O104:H7,
O76:H19 and ONT:H21.
