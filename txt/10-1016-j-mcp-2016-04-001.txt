Microarray-based serogenotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility tests and the detection of relevant resis-
tance genes were performed on isolates of Salmonella spp. from retail meat samples obtained in Lagos,
Nigeria.

Out of 151 meat samples, 33 Salmonella isolates were obtained. Nine different Salmonella serovars (S.
Amoutive, S. Bargny, S. Drac, S. Ealing, S. Urbana, S. Hadar, S. Nyborg, S. Anatum and S. Havana) were
identiÔ¨Åed by microarray-based serogenotyping and conÔ¨Årmed afterwards using classical serotyping.
Antibiotic susceptibility tests with 17 antibiotics showed that almost all isolates were fully susceptible to
this panel.

The results of this study indicated a high prevalence of Salmonella in retail meat, the presence of some
previously rather rarely described Serovars in retail meat samples from Lagos, and a need to monitor for
Salmonella and their antibiotic resistance determinants. The microarray-based system used herein
proved to be perfectly suited as epidemiological tool to replace classical serotyping.

1. Introduction

Food-borne salmonellosis is one of the most prevalent zoonotic
diseases worldwide. It often follows consumption of contaminated
animal products, which usually originate from infected animals
used in food production or from post mortem contamination of
carcasses and/or meat [1]. Salmonella infections of live animals,
including cattle, swine and sheep, arise from intensive rearing
practices and from the use of contaminated feeds [2]. Stress asso-
ciated with transport of the animals to an abattoir augments
shedding of Salmonella by carrier animals, and this may contribute

to the spread of the organism to other animals in the slaughter
plants [3].

Serotyping is an epidemiological tool for Salmonella character-
ization helping to determine identity/non-identity of isolates to
enable detection of case clusters and outbreaks and to link human
cases to e.g. brands or batches of foodstuff [4]. Therefore, it is
pertinent to carry out serotyping for all culture conÔ¨Årmed cases of
Salmonella infection. For typing, a scheme was developed that bases
on antigenic variations affecting O (somatic) as well as H (Ô¨Çagellar)
antigens. The number of Salmonella spp. serotypes covered by this
so-called White-Kaufmann-LeMinor scheme expanded from 44
serovars known in 1934 to 2587 serovars currently known [5,6].

Currently, 46 Salmonella O-serogroups have been described. The
genes of the O-antigen, Ô¨Çippase (wzx) and polymerase (wzy), are
highly variable and speciÔ¨Åc for their respective serogroup [7e9].
For the H-antigen, there are two known Ô¨Çagella structural genes,
Ô¨ÇiC and Ô¨ÇjB,which are highly conserved at their 50 and 30 ends and
variable in their central regions [10].

Aside from the fact that classical serotyping is labor intensive,

time consuming and expensive (requiring 250 sera to characterize
2500 serovars), this method is certainly out of reach of most lab-
oratories, especially in the developing countries. As an alternative
method, serogenotyping using unique DNA sequence information
for identiÔ¨Åcation, is highly reproducible, accessible and can easily
be standardized worldwide. This has led to the development of
different molecular typing systems such as DNA sequencing ap-
proaches [11], microarrays [7e9] and ligation-based microarrays
[12]. Some are however fraught with the challenges of typing only a
small sub-set of serotypes and are also expensive and/or labor
intensive to be implemented in diagnostic or public health
laboratories.

In Nigeria, there are limited data on the prevalence of Salmonella
serovars causing disease in humans as well as of those that can be
encountered in livestock or food products. Only the study by Fashae
et al. (2010) gave information on the serovars prevalent in humans
as well as animals, and the authors found different serovars present
in both the human and animal isolates, with some rare otherwise
serovars predominating amongst the animal and human isolates
[13]. Another study from the city of Maiduguri, Nigeria, described
observations of the rare serovar S. Hiduddify that was isolated from
chicken and poultry meat [14]. According to the report by Akinyemi
et al. (2015) [15], the Salmonella spp. isolated from patients in Lagos,
Nigeria with pyrexia and gastroenteritis were S. Enteritidis, S. Par-
atyphi and S. Typhi, while Ifeanyi et al. (2014) [16], isolated S.
Enteritidis, S. Zanzibar and S. Brancanstar from diarrhoeic children
in Abuja, Nigeria. Another report from North west Nigeria, showed
cases of S. Typhi, S. Paratyphi A, S. Arizonae, S. Typhimurium and S.
Enteritidis amongst children and adults presenting with pyrexia
and gastroenteritis Abdullahi et al. (2013) [17].

To our best knowledge, this is the Ô¨Årst study for Lagos, Nigeria
that investigates the direct isolation of Salmonella from retail meat
purchased in different market places. All isolates conÔ¨Årmed as
Salmonella were subsequently serogenotyped using the technique
developed previously [8], as well as screened phenotypically and
genotypically for antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. The main
aim of this study was to evaluate the microarray-based technique to
supplement or to replace the classical serotyping as epidemiolog-
ical tool in countries where standardized sera are too expensive
and/or unavailable.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sample collection, bacterial isolation and preliminary
identiÔ¨Åcation

One hundred and Ô¨Åfty one samples of meat, consisting of beef
(n ¬º 81), chicken (n ¬º 30), pork (n ¬º 16), and goat (n ¬º 24) from
different parts of these animals, were purchased from various ab-
attoirs and markets in six locations of different local government
areas (LGA) in different districts of Lagos city. This included facilities
in the towns of Mushin (in the Mushin LGA; n ¬º 64), Yaba (Main-
land LGA; n ¬º 40), Ketu (Kosofe LGA; n ¬º 16), Berger (Ikeja LGA;
n ¬º 9), Ojota (Kosofe LGA; n ¬º 5) and Surulere (Surulere LGA;
n ¬º 17). All samples were collected between May and August
2013into sterile plastic containers at room temperature and
transferred to the laboratory within 2 h of collection. Each sample
was stored at 4 C and put up for culture within 2 h. BrieÔ¨Çy, 10 g of
each meat sample were homogenized in 90 ml of sterile Rappaport-
Vasiliadis enrichment broth (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) using a sterile
homogenizer in a sterile bottle. The homogenized samples were
incubated at 37 C for 18e24 h. An inoculation loop of the ho-
mogenate was inoculated onto Deoxycholate Citrate Agar (DCA,
Oxoid Limited, Basingstoke, UK), at 37 C for 18e24 h. Colonies
were subsequently subcultured and incubated at 37 C for 24 h on

Salmonella-Shigella-Agar (SSA, Oxoid Limited, Basingstoke, UK) in
order to obtain discrete pure colonies. Colony material of all isolates
was Gram stained to verify that they were Gram-negative bacilli.
Isolates were further identiÔ¨Åed on XLD agar by identifying colony
morphology that was oxidase negative, non-lactose fermenters and
hydrogen producers (colonies with black dots). Thirty-three iso-
lates identiÔ¨Åed presumptively as Salmonella spp. were conÔ¨Årmed
using the Salm-SeroGenoTyping AS-1 Kit (Alere Technologies
GmbH,
Jena, Germany) and the VITEK 2 system (BioMerieux,
Nuertingen, Germany).

2.2. Serogenotyping of Salmonella serovars

Isolates were cultivated on tryptone-yeast agar (TY-agar), and
genomic DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood &
Tissue Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. If necessary, DNA was concentrated to
at least 100 ng/ml using a Speed Vac centrifuge (Eppendorf,
Hamburg, Germany) at 1400 rpm at 30 C for 30 min. All isolates
were genotyped by the array-based serogenotyping assay Salm-
SeroGenoTyping AS-1 Kit according to manufacturer's
in-
structions. The DNA-based microarray used includes 255 different
targets to analyze O- and H-phases and assign the genotype to the
antigenic formula according to the White-Kauffmann-LeMinor
scheme. Additionally, the genus-speciÔ¨Åc genes invA (M90846.1),
galF (X56793.1) and manC (X59886.1) were used as marker to
identify genus Salmonella. With this microarray-based method, 132
different Salmonella serovars could be identiÔ¨Åed. Also, 77 targets
were included that were related to antimicrobial resistance. Details
of used targets and software analysis are described in Ref. [8].

After DNA isolation, a multiplex linear DNA ampliÔ¨Åcation was
used for site-speciÔ¨Åc internal labelling of the corresponding target
region using dUTP linked biotin as a marker. BrieÔ¨Çy, the linear
ampliÔ¨Åcation steps included 5 min of initial denaturation at 96 C,
followed by 50 cycles with 20 s of annealing at 50 C, 40 s of
elongation at 72 C, and 60 s of denaturation at 96 C. This reaction
results in a multitude of speciÔ¨Åcally ampliÔ¨Åed, single-stranded,
biotin-labeled DNA molecules for subsequent hybridization to the
corresponding DNA microarray built in the ArrayStrips delivered
with Salm-SeroGenoTyping AS-1 Kit. The ArrayStrips were placed
in a BioShaker iQ thermomixer (Q. Instruments, Jena, Germany) and
subsequently washed with 200 ml of de-ionized water for 5 min at
55C/550 rpm and with 100 ml hybridization buffer C1 for 5 min at
55C/550 rpm. All liquids were always completely removed using a
soft plastic pipette to avoid scratching of the chip surface. In a
separate tube, 10 ml of the labeled, single-stranded DNA were
diluted in 90 ml hybridization buffer C1. The hybridization was
carried out at 55 C, shaking at 550 rpm for 1 h. After hybridization,
the ArrayStrips were washed twice for 5 min with 200 ml washing
buffer C2 at 45 C, shaking at 550 rpm. Peroxidase-streptavidin
conjugate C3 was diluted 1:100 in buffer C4. A total of 100 ml of
this mixture was added to each cavity of the ArrayStrip, and sub-
sequently incubated for 10 min at 30 C and 550 rpm. Afterwards,
washing was carried out twice at 550 rpm with 200 ml C5 washing
buffer at 30 C, with each step performed for 5 min. Visualization
was achieved by adding 100 ml of a locally precipitating dye, D1, to
the ArrayStrips. Microarrays were analyzed using the ArrayMate
device with IconoClust version 3.2r1. Results, including serovar
assignment and identiÔ¨Åcation of AMR genes, are then described in
detail
in the result-HTML-Ô¨Åles (supplementary information 1).
Microarray raw data of all
isolates are provided in the
supplementary information 2. Classical serotyping using slide
agglutination was carried out by the National Reference Laboratory
for Salmonellosis in Cattle, at the Friedrich-LoefÔ¨Çer-Institute (FLI,
Jena, Germany), according to ISO 6579:2002 [12].

2.3. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

All Salmonella isolates were tested using an automated suscep-
tibility testing technique (VITEK 2, bioMerieux, Nuertingen, Ger-
many). BrieÔ¨Çy, all isolates were cultured overnight on TY-agar for
12 h at 37 C. Single colonies were used to prepare a 0.5 McFarland
standard solution in 0.45% saline. This solution was used to load
VITEK 2 cards AST-N289 (bioMerieux REF NO. 415 057). Nalidixic
acid was additionally tested using the disk diffusion method in
accordance with National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Stan-
dards [18].

resistance genes sul1 and sul2 were found in two isolates from beef
assigned as S. Amoutive (Nig-082) and S. Ealing (Nig-149), respec-
tively. These genes are known to mediate resistance to sulfameth-
oxazole. Phenotypic tests for sulfamethoxazole were not performed
since the VITEK AST-N289 panel considered only co-trimoxazole,
i.e., a combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, and
isolates were found to be susceptible to co-trimoxazole.

Other resistance genes covered by the described test were not
found using the Salm-SeroGenoTyping Kit. The isolates S. Amoutive
(Nig-082), S. Bargny (Nig-129-2), S. Ealing (Nig-077), S. Drac (Nig-
107) and S. Havana (Nig-009) were resistant to nalidixic acid.

2.4. Statistical tests

4. Discussion

Statistical tests were performed to discriminate the prevalence
of Salmonella isolates between study sites and type of meat. The
signiÔ¨Åcance (p) were conducted using the Fisher's exact test on
Refs. [19,20].

3. Results

Out of the 151 food samples collected, 33 samples (21.8%) were
tested positive for Salmonella. All obtained isolates (n ¬º 33) were
conÔ¨Årmed as Salmonella using the Salm-SeroGenoTyping AS-1 Kit
and the VITEK 2 System, and were tested positive for invA, galF and
manC as species marker for Salmonella using the microarray tech-
nique (Table 1).

(18/81) of identiÔ¨Åed Salmonella isolates originated from beef.
Smaller numbers originated from chicken (10/30), goat (4/24) and
pork (1/16). Table 1 show all details, including host species and
sampling site, for each single isolate of Salmonella spp.

The isolates were identiÔ¨Åed to belong to nine different serovars.
S. Amoutive was the most common serovar accounting for 24.2%
(n ¬º 8), and it was present in all meat samples (Table 1). The isolates
from beef samples included: S. Anatum (n ¬º 3), S. Ealing (n ¬º 4), S.
Havana (n ¬º 1), S. Nyborg (n ¬º 2), S. Urbana (n ¬º 1), S. Bargny
(n ¬º 3), and S. Amoutive (n ¬º 4). The isolates from chicken samples
included: S. Anatum (n ¬º 1), S. Hadar (n ¬º 1), S. Drac (n ¬º 2), S.
Havana (n ¬º 1), S. Amoutive (n ¬º 2), S. Bargny (n ¬º 2) and S. Nyborg
(n ¬º 1). The only isolate obtained from pork was S. Amoutive.
Isolates from goat included: S. Anatum (n ¬º 1), S. Ealing (n ¬º 1), S.
Amoutive (n ¬º 1) and S. Drac (n ¬º 1). In the present study S. Hadar
was only found in samples from chicken while S. Urbana was
unique in samples collected from beef. S. Drac was found in both,
goat and chicken samples. The serogenotyping results were
conÔ¨Årmed by classical serotyping using agglutination (Table 1)
indicating that all Salmonella isolates were correctly typed using
the Salm-SeroGenoTyping AS-1 Kit.

Due to missing O-antigen signals of three isolates, analyses via
the PatternMatch algorithm (as described in Ref. [8]) could be not
performed. Nevertheless, all three isolates showed the same H-
antigens signals; H1:l,w and H2:e,n,x. Classical analysis for all three
isolates by serotyping yielded the O-antigen O:47. The serological
results for H-antigens H1 and H2 were in concordance with the
results of the array-based serogenotyping. These isolates were
assigned as S. Drac (47:l,w:e,n,x).

Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed that only S. Amoutive
isolate Nig-120 and S. Nyborg isolate Nig-135 were resistant to
ampicillin, while S. Amoutive isolate Nig-120 was also resistant to
ampicillin/sulbactam, cefuroxime, cefuroxime-axetil, cefotaxime
and ceftazidime (supplementary information 3). No beta-lactamase
gene to which this phenotype possibly could be attributed was
found in these two isolates. All other isolates were sensitive to the
17 antimicrobials included into the AST-N289 panel and did not
yield signals for the resistance markers screened. However, the

To our best knowledge this is the Ô¨Årst report about Salmonella in
retail meat from Lagos, Nigeria. The results of our study showed
that Salmonella spp. were more isolated from beef than any other of
the food source sampled during the time period in this study.
Nevertheless, statistical analyses yielded no signiÔ¨Åcant differences
in the prevalence of Salmonella between chicken, pork, beef and
goat (p ¬º 0.19, Fisher's Exact test). However, differed the prevalence
of Salmonella signiÔ¨Åcant between different study sites (p ¬º 0.005,
Fisher's Exact test).

Food samples from Ojota (Kosofe LGA) market were found to
have the highest number of Salmonella spp. (3 of 5 samples). This
high prevalence could be explained by the low number of samples
collected and also due to the fact that all the samples were collected
from the same market with a common abattoir. Food samples from
Surulere (Surulere) (9/17 samples) and Ketu/Ojota (Kosofe) (7/21
samples) were found to have very high prevalence of Salmonella.
Although Surulere is not close to Ketu/Ojota, the latter two are close
to each other and could likely to have been supplied by the same
abattoirs. However, Surulere is one of the dirty regions in Lagos city,
hence the high prevalence of Salmonella spp.

S. Nyborg and S. Urbana were peculiar to Mushin (Mushin LGA)
area, while S. Hadar was found only in Berger (Ikeja LGA). Both LGAs
are far from each other and markets where the samples were taken
might have been supplied from different abattoirs. In a study from
South West and North East of Nigeria, S. Kentucky was isolated from
their chicken isolates in 4.9% of samples [21]. In our study S. Ken-
tucky was not found in the meat samples. Fashae et al., [13] re-
ported S. Virchow to be more prevalent (71.0%) among their chicken
isolates, in contrast to our study where we did not isolate any S.
Virchow in chicken or other food samples. Interestingly, none of the
Salmonella serovars isolated from the chicken farms during the
Fashae study [13] belonged to the same serovars as those from
chicken in our study. The absence of serovars S. Kentucky and S.
Virchow might be related to the samples and sampling method. In
both studies [13,21] only fecal samples taken from living animals in
poultry farms were analyzed. In contrast, in the present study
samples were taken directly from different abattoirs and markets
where the chicken was already handled. The source of sampling
makes a big difference as contaminations with other Salmonella
serovars may occur during processing. Nevertheless, other param-
eters like the geographic distance, temporal changes (i.e., a change
of the population structure during several years), seasonal vari-
ability, local outbreak situations, and/or different races or breeds of
chicken could play a major role for the serovar composition.

In another study from Africa, Burkina Faso, S. Drac was isolated
from feces of cattle [22]. In our study S. Drac was isolated from
chicken and goat meat samples, collected in three closely located
LGAs (Surulere, Mushin and Mainland). We assume that all three
markets were supplied from the same major abattoir and
contamination with S. Drac occurs during the slaughtering process.
In a study from Tunisia, S. Hadar was isolated from poultry meat

b Classical serotyping was done for at least one serovar which was detected by the Salm-SeroGenoTyping AS-1 Kit. All Isolates belonging to serovar S. Drac were tested by

classical serotyping.

[23]. Also in our study one S. Hadar serovar was isolated from a
chicken sample collected from a market in Berger (Ikeja LGA).

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that the isolates S.
Amoutive Nig-120 and S. Nyborg Nig-135 were resistant to ampi-
cillin, with S. Amoutive Nig-120 being resistant also to ampicillin/
sulbactam, cefuroxime, cefuroxime-axetil, cefotaxime and ceftazi-
dime. In this study all isolates were sensitive to oÔ¨Çoxacin and cip-
roÔ¨Çoxacin. A report by Akinyemi et al. [24], in 2003 from Lagos,
Nigeria (although from humans and typhoid fever patients), stated
the fact that oÔ¨Çoxacin and ciproÔ¨Çoxacin are the drugs of choice for
S. Typhi, current Ô¨Åndings also from humans show that our local
Salmonella spp. are still sensitive to oÔ¨Çoxacin and ciproÔ¨Çoxacin
[16,17]. Our data also reported all Salmonella isolates to be sensitive
against both antibiotics. All isolates were sensitive to tetracycline,
which is contrary to that reported by both Fashae et al. (2010) and
Adeyanju & Ishola [25] (which was also from South West of Nigeria)
in which the majority of chicken isolates were resistant to tetra-
cycline (93%) [13]. Data are not available to compare the possibil-
ities for this discrepancy. Other Nigerian studies by Refs. [13,21,23]
with isolates from poultry, showed high prevalence rates of

resistance to nalidixic acid and high level of reduced susceptibility
to ciproÔ¨Çoxacin, in contrast to our study, where the isolates were all
sensitive to ciproÔ¨Çoxacin with only Ô¨Åve isolates (15.2%) resistant to
nalidixic acid. These results could be due to unregulated use of
antibiotics in our environment, coupled with different sample
types and different years of isolation. Although S. Amoutive isolate
Nig-120 was resistant to 2nd and 3rd generation cephalosporins as
identiÔ¨Åed by phenotypically VITEK 2 system, analysis of the isolate
revealed no antibiotic resistance genes (i.e., blaCTX-M-1/15 or
blaOXA) which normally mediated such a phenotype. Possible ex-
planations are that i) there was a beta-lactamase gene present in
the isolate that was not covered by the microarray at all, or ii) that a
primer or probe binding site of a beta-lactamase gene was signiÔ¨Å-
cantly altered hindering detection by the array or that iii) another
mechanism like a multidrug-resistance efÔ¨Çux pump [26] mediated
the resistance. The resistance genes sul1 and sul2 found in S.
Amoutive (Nig-082) and S. Ealing (Nig-149) are known to mediate
resistance to sulfamethoxazole. Phenotypic tests
(VITEK 2)
considered only co-trimoxazole and isolates were found to be
susceptible to co-trimoxazole. This could be explained by the fact

that resistance to co-trimoxazole requires the presence of both, sul
and dfrA genes. The gene dfrA was not detected in both isolates.
These results show once again the limitations of molecular tests
[27]. Genotypes as deÔ¨Åned by molecular assays do not always
reÔ¨Çect the phenotype and vice versa, not for all phenotypes the
responsible genes are detected. Therefore, a direct comparison of
phenotype and genotype is necessary to validate a molecular assay
[28e30]. The different results between this study and other studies
regarding population structure and antibiotic resistance could be
explained by the samples described in this study. Salmonella iso-
lated from fecal samples of industrial livestock farming may be
more resistant to antibiotics due to the high tasks of antibiotics in
such areas. In this study Salmonella were isolated from handled
meat of different animals and the sources of Salmonella contami-
nation are unknown. We assume that the Salmonella population
structure described in this study differs in their resistance in
comparison to isolates from livestock farming.

5. Conclusion

from living animals

To our knowledge this study is the Ô¨Årst report of serogenotyping
of food samples in Lagos Nigeria. Previously studies about Salmo-
nella were mainly conducted in industrial animal farms using
samples
[13,21,31]. The prevalence of
conÔ¨Årmed Salmonella spp. amongst the samples tested was about
21.8%. To our opinion, such a percentage of handled and retailed
meat is alarmingly high. Therefore, any handled meat should be
regularly monitored. Serovars, that are rare elsewhere, were iso-
lated from these food samples, and occurred in all the food types. In
addition, resistance was detected amongst our chicken and beef
isolates, with isolates from Ketu/Ojota and Surulere having the
highest prevalence. Continuous monitoring of antibiotic resistance
should be carried out in these areas to prevent further spread of
antibiotic resistant Salmonella. Taken together, microarray-based
serogenotyping is a method which is affordable, easy to perform
around different laboratories all over the world and easily to extend
and adapt. The increasing availability of sequencing data will
improve the technology rapidly.
