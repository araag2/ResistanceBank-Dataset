Summary
The sources and modes of transmission of non- typhoidal Salmonella particularly zo-
onotic transmission are poorly understood in Africa. This study compared phenotypic 
and genotypic characteristics of Salmonellae isolated from cattle and humans. Faecal 
samples of diarrhoeic patients (n = 234), and a healthy population (n = 160), beef cattle 
at slaughter (n = 250), farms (n = 72) and market (n = 100) were cultured for salmonel-
lae and serotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility were determined. Whole- genome 
sequence typing (WGST) of selected isolates and bioinformatic analysis were used to 
identify the multilocus sequence type (MLST), plasmid replicons, antimicrobial resist-
ance genes and genetic relatedness by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. 
The Salmonella isolates, diarrhoeic patients (n = 17), healthy population (n = 13), cattle 
(abattoir,  n = 67;  farms,  n = 10;  market  n = 5),  revealed  49  serovars;  some  serovars 
were common to humans and cattle. Rare serovars were prevalent: Colindale (cattle 
and humans); Rubislaw and Bredeney (humans); and Dublin, Give, Eastbourne, Hadar, 
Marseille, Sundsvall, Bergen, Ekotedo, Carno and Ealing (cattle). The sequence types 
(ST)  include  ST  584,  ST  198,  ST  562  and  ST  512  for  S.  Colindale,  S.  Kentucky  S. 
Rubislaw and S. Urbana, respectively. Clonal cluster shared by cattle and human WGST 
isolates was not found. Antimicrobial resistance rates were generally low and towards 
only chloramphenicol, ampicillin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline and strepto-
mycin, range 2.7% (chloramphenicol) to 8.9% (streptomycin). Multiply resistant iso-
lates included serovars Kentucky, 4,5,12:i:-  and Typhimurium. The study presents a 
baseline description of the prevalence, serotypes, antimicrobial resistance phenotypes 
and genetic relatedness of Salmonella isolated from healthy and diarrhoeic humans, 
and cattle at harvest, on farm and at market. Cattle are a reservoir of diverse salmonel-
lae with shared serovars with humans, but WGST does not support zoonotic transmis-
sion.  Further  study  with  larger  samples  is  recommended  to  determine  whether 
epidemiological link exists between cattle and humans.

1 |  INTRODUCTION

Salmonella infections generally present as self- limiting gastroenteritis. 
Non- typhoidal Salmonella is a major cause of gastroenteritis estimated 
at  93.8  million  cases  and  155,000  deaths  globally  (Majowicz  et al., 
2010). Of the over 2,500 Salmonella serovars, the few causing infec-
tions are dominated by S. Typhimurium (ST) and S. Enteritidis (SE) glob-
ally. There are sparse data on prevalent Salmonella serovars associated 
with gastroenteritis in humans in sub- Saharan Africa, but ST and SE 
and S. Collindale have been reported prevalent in Kenya and Gambia 
(Dione, Ikumapayi, Saha, Mohammed, & Geerts, 2011; Kariuki et al., 
2006; O’Reilly, Jaron, Ochieng, Nyaguara, & Tate, 2012). Reports on 
Salmonella serovars associated with gastroenteritis in Nigeria are few 
(Ifeanyi, Bassey, Ikeneche, & Al- Gallas, 2014; Raufu et al., 2013) and 
limited by small sample size and geographical location.

The  routes  of  transmission  of  Salmonella  include  animals, water, 
foods, person- to- person contact and the environment. While in the 
developed countries, the majority of human Salmonella infection are 
foodborne  (Jackson,  Griffin,  Cole,  Walsh,  &  Chai,  2013;  Majowicz 
et al.,  2010),  the  relative  importance  of  the  transmission  routes  in 
Africa is poorly understood (Dione et al., 2011; Kariuki et al., 2006). 
Source attribution studies based on genomic subtyping have the po-
tential to provide valuable information (Onsari & MacLennan, 2014) 
but  are  scarcely  performed  in  Nigeria  (Leekitcharoenphon  et al., 
2016); serotyping, which might not translate to genetic similarity, has 
been used (Raufu et al., 2013).

Food animals (like cattle) play a significant role in the epidemiology 
of Salmonella, because they act as reservoirs and excrete salmonellae 
in their faeces (Rodriguez- Rivera et al., 2014); therefore, the meat and 
meat  products  can  be  contaminated  during  slaughter  and  process-
ing, posing health risks; infections can also result from cattle contact 
(Cummings et al., 2012; Leekitcharoenphon et al., 2016). Beef cattle 
are  an  important  potential  source  of  salmonellae  in  Nigeria  as  they 
are widely consumed. The potential for zoonotic transmission is fur-
ther increased given limited capacity for sanitation and comingling of 
livestock with human population. Subtyping Salmonella remains key to 
identify sources of human infections for implementation of interven-
tions and control measures. Next- generation sequencing technologies 
have made whole- genome sequencing (WGS) of foodborne bacterial 
pathogens a realistic and superior alternative to traditional subtyping 
methods;  routine,  real- time  and  widespread  application  of  WGS  in 
food safety and public health is now possible (Deng, den Bakker, & 
Hendriksen, 2016). WGS evaluation of salmonellae isolated from hu-
mans and cattle is therefore warranted to lay the foundation for being 
able to use WGS for source attribution in this part of the world.

Antimicrobial resistance has increased and is widespread, hence 
a  public  health  concern  (Crump,  Sjölund- Karlsson,  Gordon,  &  Parry, 
2015)  with  indiscriminate  use  of  antimicrobials  being  a  factor 
(Collignon, Powers, Chiller, Aidara- Kane, & Aarestrup, 2009) and calls 
for continuous surveillance and control.

This  study  elucidated  the  prevalence,  serotypes  and  antimicro-
bial  resistance  phenotypes  of  salmonellae  and  genetic  relatedness 
(using WGS) of shared serovars isolated from healthy and diarrhoeic 

Impacts
•  There  was  some  overlap  between  the  Salmonella  sero-

types observed between humans and cattle.

•  But the WGS data do not support an epidemiological link 

between the strains from humans and cattle.

•  Further study is needed to determine whether an epide-

miological link exists.

humans and cattle at harvest, cattle at market and on farms in Nigeria, 
focusing at establishing baseline data to eventually make trace- back 
possible.

2 |  MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 | Collection of faecal samples

Faecal  samples  were  randomly  collected  from  human  cases  of  di-
arrhoea  (n = 234),  apparently  healthy  pregnant  women  attending 
an  antenatal  clinic  at  Adeoyo  Hospital  (n = 160)  and  beef  cattle  at 
slaughter  (n = 250),  cattle  market  (n = 100)  and  two  cattle  farms 
(n = 30;  n = 42,  respectively)  (Figure 1).  Faecal  samples  were  col-
lected  between  September  2011  and  August  2013:  cattle  (2011–
2012), pregnant women (2011) and diarrhoeic cases (April 2012 to 
October 2013). The cattle faecal samples were obtained from Bodija 
abattoir where most cattle were slaughtered and butchered for con-
sumption by the population of Ibadan; the Akinyele cattle market was 
one of the main markets while the cattle farms were chosen based 
on accessibility. The human diarrhoeic samples were obtained from 
three  hospitals  (Adeoyo  and  Oni  and  Son  General  and  University 
College Hospitals) and a Mokola Primary Health Centre 111 of the 
patients were females and 143 were less than 15 years old. Figure 1 
(map)  shows  the  hospitals,  primary  health  centre,  Bodija  abattoir, 
cattle market and cattle farms where faecal samples were collected. 
Informed consent (written or verbal) of all human subjects was ob-
tained; parents or guardians of children gave informed consent on 
behalf of the children. At slaughter, cattle faecal samples were col-
lected into sterile bottles from the cattle rectum using a pair of gloves 
per animal by the veterinarians on duty at the abattoir, while the cat-
tle  faecal  samples  collected  from  the  farms  and  market  were  ran-
domly obtained from the floor.

2.2 | Isolation of Salmonella

Each  5 g  of  faecal  sample  was  inoculated  into  25 ml  of  selenite  F 
broth (Lab M, Lancashire, UK) and incubated aerobically at 37°C for 
24 hr (Fashae, Ogunsola, Aarestrup, & Hendriksen, 2010). Thereafter, 
a loopful of the broth was plated onto Salmonella-Shigella agar (SSA; 
Lab  M)  by  streaking  and  the  SSA  plate  was  then  incubated  aerobi-
cally at 37°C for 24 hr. Then, presumptive Salmonella colonies from 
the SSA plate were re- subcultured by streaking onto fresh SSA plates

and  incubated  as  above  for  purification.  All  presumptive  Salmonella 
isolates were then identified  by standard methods  (Cowan & Steel, 
1974);  isolates  that  were  Gram- negative  rods,  oxidative  negative, 

glucose  fermenters,  non- lactose  fermenters  and  hydrogen  sulphide 
producers  were  subjected  to  serotyping  for  the  identification  of 
Salmonella serovars.

2.3 | Serotyping of Salmonella isolates

Only 85 of the 112 biochemically confirmed isolates were serotyped 
by slide agglutination using Salmonella polyvalent and monovalent O 
and  H  antisera  (Diagnostic  Pasteur,  Paris,  France)  according  to  the 
Kauffmann–White  classification  scheme  (Grimont  &  Weill,  2007). 
These included 40 of the cattle isolates and all others.

2.4 | Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 
Salmonella isolates

The susceptibility of all the 112 Salmonella isolates to 12 antimicro-
bials  was  determined  by  disc  diffusion  method  on  Mueller- Hinton 
agar  (Merck,  Hamburg,  Germany)  plates  according  to  the  Clinical 
and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines (CLSI M02- A12, 
2015a). The Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was used as the quality con-
trol  strain.  The  antimicrobial  discs  (Oxoid,  Basingstoke,  Hampshire, 
UK)  tested  were  ampicillin  (10 μg),  cefotaxime  (30 μg),  ceftazidime 
(30 μg),  ceftriaxone  (30 μg),  chloramphenicol  (30 μg),  ciprofloxacin 
(5 μg), gentamicin (10 μg), nalidixic acid (30 μg), streptomycin (10 μg), 
sulphonamides (300 μg), tetracycline (30 μg) and trimethoprim (5 μg). 
Diameters of zones inhibition were measured with a ruler and inter-
preted  by  the  CLSI  guidelines  (CLSI  M100- S25  2015b).  Salmonella 
isolates  with  ciprofloxacin  disc  diffusion  zones  of  inhibition  in  the 
intermediate  range  (<30 mm)  were  interpreted  as  showing  reduced 
susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (CLSI M100- S25b).

2.5 | Whole- genome sequencing

Genomes of the following isolates of S. Colindale (n = 7), S. Rubislaw 
(n = 3),  S.  Urbana  (n = 2),  S.  Agama  (n = 2)  and  S.  Kentucky  (n = 4) 
(selected  based  on  isolation  from  more  than  one  source  or  multi-
plicity  of  isolates  and  cost  consideration)  were  sequenced  using  a 
Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) as described 
earlier  (Hendriksen  et al.,  2015).  The  quality  of  the  reads  was  as-
sessed using the FastQC quality control tool (http://www.bioinfor-
matics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), reads with a quality score 
of below 20 were filtered out, and all the remaining reads were as-
sembled using the assembler pipeline (version 1.4) available from the 
Center for Genomic Epidemiology (CGE) (http://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/ser-
vices/all.php). Raw sequence data were submitted to the European 
Nucleotide  Archive  (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena)  under  study  ac-
cession  no.:  PRJEB21564  (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/ 
PRJEB21564). A complete list of genomic sequence data is available 
in the Table S1. The assembled sequences were analysed to identify 
the MLST sequence type (ST) for Salmonella enterica, plasmid repli-
cons and acquired antimicrobial resistance genes using the pipelines 
mlst (version 1.7), plasmidfinder (version 1.2, 80% threshold for %ID) 
and  resfinder  (version  2.1,  80%  threshold  for  %ID/60%  minimum 
length) available from CGE (Carattoli et al., 2014; Larsen et al., 2012; 
Zankari et al., 2012). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were 
determined  using  the  pipeline  csi  phylogeny  (version  1.4)  available 
from  the  CGE  (http://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/all.php).  The  refer-
ence genomes used for SNP analysis were S. Colindale (HD 3A), one 

of the contemporary isolates due to lack of appropriate reference 
genome; others were S. Kentucky Str CMV 29188 and S. Rubislaw 
Str  10717.  The  pipeline  is  a  suite  of  different  public  programmes. 
The reads were aligned against the genome of S. Colindale (HD 3A), 
S. Kentucky Str CMV 29188 or S. Rubislaw Str 10717 depending on 
the Salmonella serovar using the Burrows- Wheeler Aligner (bwa) ver-
sion 0.7.2 (Li & Durbin, 2009). SNP calling was by samtools version 
0.1.18  (Li  et al.,  2009)  “mpileup”  commands.  Subsequently,  SNPs 
were  selected  when  meeting  the  following  criteria:  (i)  a  minimum 
distance of 15 bps between each SNP (pruning); (ii) a minimum of 
10% of the average depth; (iii) the mapping quality was above 30; (iv) 
the SNP quality was more than 20; and (v) all indels were excluded. 
The qualified SNPs from each genome were concatenated to a single 
alignment corresponding to position of the reference genome. The 
concatenated sequences were subjected to tree construction using 
maximum likelihood from FastTree (Price, Dehal, & Arkin, 2010).

2.6 | Ethical approval

The study was approved by the Ethic Committee of the Ministry of 
Health, Ibadan, Oyo State and University of Ibadan.

3 |  RESULTS

3.1 | Salmonella serovars distribution

Overall  Salmonella  prevalence  was  13.7%  (n = 112);  the  serotyped 
isolates revealed 49 serovars from both the human and cattle sources 
(Table 1).  The  prevalence  varied  with  source:  the  highest  was  ob-
served in beef cattle at slaughter (n = 67; 26.8%) followed by healthy 
women (n = 13; 8.1%) and diarrhoeic humans (n = 17; 7.3%) with cat-
tle at the market having the least prevalence (n = 5; 0.5%). Cattle at 
slaughter also had the highest serovar diversity (n = 28) followed by 
diarrhoeic humans (n = 13) and healthy women (n = 9) (Table 1). The 
least serovar diversity was observed in cattle at the market (n = 3).

S. Colindale and S. Rubislaw co- predominated (each with a prev-
alence  of  17.6%)  in  diarrhoeic  humans.  S.  Bredeney  (n = 3;  23%) 
predominated  in  healthy women;  S.  Dublin  (n = 5;  13%)  in  cattle  at 
slaughter;  S.  Ekotedo  co- predominated with  S.  Carno  in  one  of  the 
cattle  farms  (n = 3;  33%  each)  while  S.  Ekotedo  was  also  the  only 
Salmonella  isolated  in  the  other  farm.  In  the  cattle  market,  both  S. 
Kentucky and S. Ealing co- predominated (n = 2; 40% each). There was 
overlapping  of  Salmonella  serovars  between  humans  and  cattle  and 
also between the diarrhoeic patients and healthy women; such sero-
vars  included  Colindale,  Give,  Corvallis,  Oranienburg  and  Kentucky. 
Furthermore,  one  isolate  of  serovar  4,5,12:i:-   (monophasic  variant 
of S. Typhimurium) was recovered from a diarrhoeic woman and a S. 
Typhimurium isolate from a healthy woman.

3.2 | Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 
Salmonella isolates

Only 9.8% (11/112) of the Salmonella isolates showed resistance to 
at least one of the tested antimicrobials (Table 1). The antimicrobial

resistance  was  observed  only  towards  ampicillin,  chloramphenicol, 
ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, streptomycin and tetracycline with resist-
ance prevalences ranging from chloramphenicol (n = 3, 2.7%) to strep-
tomycin (n = 10, 8.9%).

The majority (83.3%) of the resistant isolates was obtained from 
the healthy women and comprised six serovars while all the three 
resistant isolates from cattle were S. Kentucky. All the ciprofloxacin- 
resistant isolates were also belonging to S. Kentucky, while one S. 
Corvallis isolate, obtained from a healthy woman, showed reduced 
susceptibility  to  ciprofloxacin.  Furthermore,  seven  (63.6%)  of  the 
resistant  isolates  showed  multidrug  resistance  (MDR)  (resistance 
to	≥3	antimicrobials);	majority	(57.1%)	of	the	MDR	isolates	were	S. 
Kentucky (Table 2).

3.3 | Whole- genome sequence analysis

All the human and cattle isolates of S. Colindale except one (cattle) 
showed the same MLST loci and alleles; aroC- 6, dnaN- 18, hemD- 46, 
hisD- 124, pure- 2, sucA- 175, thrA- 12; ST 584. The only exceptional 
isolate (cattle, DE 34) was a single locus variant with an alteration in 
allele dnaN- 116, unknown ST (Figure 2).

Two of the S. Kentucky isolates (cattle) showed the MLST loci and 
alleles;  aroC- 76,  dnaN- 14,  hemD- 2,  hisD- 77,  purE- 64,  sucA- 64,  thrA- 
67; ST 198. The remaining two isolates (human and cattle; AK 584 and 

HD 68L) were single locus and double loci variants with alterations in 
alleles  hisD- 517  and  aroC- 174  and  hisD- 100,  respectively,  unknown 
ST (Figure 3). One of the S. Rubislaw isolates showed MLST and alleles 
aroC- 37, dnaN- 4, hemD- 46, hisD- 205, pure- 8, sucA- 175, thrA- 164; ST 
562. The remaining two isolates, HD 41G and HD 43H, were two and 
three loci variants, with alterations in alleles dnaN- 180 and pure- 134; and 
aroC- 166, dnaN- 180 and pure- 134, respectively, unknown ST (Figure 4). 
The S. Urbana isolates showed ST 512 and those of S. Agama, unknown 
ST.

The  phylogenetic  SNP  analysis  (maximum- likelihood  trees; 
branch length represents SNP distance and the distance is related 
to the scale below each tree) revealed no clonal cluster shared by 
human and cattle Salmonella isolates (Figures 2 and 3); the isolates 
generally formed individual lineages, with pairwise SNP differences 
of	 ≥48	 (S.  Colindale with  the  exception  of  two  human  diarrhoeic 
isolates	HD	34E	and	HD	32D)	and	≥60	(S. Kentucky) showing exis-
tence of different genetic subpopulations of strains (Figures 2 and 
3). Nevertheless, the two human diarrhoeic isolates (HD 34E and 
HD 32D) were, however, genetically related, separated by only five 
SNPs (Figure 2). All the human isolates of S. Rubislaw were genet-
ically different revealing individual lineages with pairwise- genome 
differences of 38 to 24,090 SNPs (Figure 4).

Antimicrobial resistance genes were only detected in the WGST 
MDR  Kentucky  isolates,  and  these  correlated  with  the  observed

blaTEM-1B gene was detected in the only one Kentucky isolate from a 
diarrhoeic human. Plasmid replicons were not detected.

4 |  DISCUSSION

This study showed cattle at harvest to be a reservoir of salmonellae, har-
bouring diverse serovars, many of which are important potential human 
pathogens. Although there was some overlap between the serotypes 
observed  between  cattle  and  humans,  genetic  relatedness  does  not

support  zoonotic  transmission  or  epidemiological  link.  More  data  are 
needed before concluding on the epidemiological link between the two 
populations. The observation of serovar overlap contrasted with reports 
from some African countries (Dione et al., 2011; Kariuki et al., 2006).

This study marks the first isolation of some serovars in cattle in 
Nigeria; S. Ekotedo, S. Bere, S. Begen and S. Takoradi that have been 
implicated  in  human  infections  but  never  cultured  from  non- human 
sources or cattle (Collard & Sen, 1960) suggesting cattle as the reser-
voir and probable source.

Other potential pathogens were found in cattle but not in hu-
mans in the present study: S. Dublin, an important causative agent of 
human invasive salmonellosis in Nigeria (Fashae et al., 2010; Obaro 
et al., 2015); S. Hadar, S. Muester, S. Stanleyville, S. Johanesburg, S. 
Livingstone and S. Chester (Harrois et al., 2014; Ktari et al., 2009); 
S.  Ealing  (Rowe  et al.,  1987);  S.  Kingston  (Filip,  Chihu- Amparan, 
Coman, Velázquez, & Silva, 2004); S. Eastbourne (Craven, Mackel, 
Baine, Barker, & Gangarosa, 1975); S. Worthington (Kapoor et al., 
2006) and S. Essen and S. Hato (Osman, Marouf, & Alatfeehy, 2013). 
S.  Dublin  is  the  third  commonest  cause  of  Salmonella  bacteremia 
after both S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis in Nigeria; accounting 
for  18%  (in  a  south- western  city)  and  5%  (in  the  Federal  Capital 
Territory  and  a  north- western  city)  of  cases  (Fashae  et al.,  2010; 
Obaro et al., 2015). S. Stanleyville and S. Johanesburg are probably 
persistent in cattle in Nigeria (Collard & Sen, 1960).

Overall,  rare  serovars  were  prevalent  in  the  human  infections 
with S. Colindale, S. Rubislaw, S. Bredeney and S. Urbana being the 

prevalent serovars. These serovars were less prevalent in human in-
fections  some  decades  ago  (Collard  &  Sen,  1960),  thus  indicating 
persistence and increased public health importance. Interestingly, S. 
Colindale is also prevalent in cattle in this study; the similar prevalence 
in  pigs  in  Nigeria  (Fashae  &  Hendriksen,  2014)  suggests  dissemina-
tion in food animals; therefore, food animals are probable source of 
infection. Other probable sources of S. Colindale are poultry and well 
water  (Dekker  et al.,  2015; Tabo  et al.,  2013).  It  is  noteworthy  that 
S.  Colindale  was  also  prevalent  in  human  gastroenteritis  in  Gambia 
(Dione et al., 2011) and was associated with bacteremia (Kalonji et al., 
2015;  Obaro  et al.,  2015).  Cattle  are  also  reservoirs  of  S.  Rubislaw 
coupled with pigs (Collard & Sen, 1960; Fashae & Hendriksen, 2014) 
though found only in humans in this study. The serovars S. Bredeney 
and  S.  Urbana  in  addition  to  others  that were  found  presently  only 
in humans were probably contracted from sources other than cattle 
(Fashae & Hendriksen, 2014; Fashae et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2016). 
The occurrence of S. Give in gastroenteritis and its high prevalence in 
cattle is also noteworthy; the prevalence is comparable to that in pigs 
in Nigeria (Fashae & Hendriksen, 2014); therefore, this serovar is prob-
ably an important animal pathogen in Nigeria (Higgins et al., 1997).

The healthy women carriers constitute public health risk as they 
excreted  some  clinical  important  serovars;  S.  Bredeney  (Cormican 
et al.,  2002;  Moore  et al.,  2003),  S.  Urbana  (Kocianová  et al.,  2010; 
Minami et al., 2004), S. Orianieburg (Werber et al., 2005), S. Corvalis 
(Langendorf et al., 2015) and S. Typhimurium (Im et al., 2016).This cou-
pled with the high Salmonella carriage rate suggests the importance 

FASHAE Et Al.of person- to- person Salmonella transmission (Im et al., 2016) particu-
larly intrafamilial spread (Niizuma,  Terada, Matsuda, Ogita, & Kataoka, 
2002).

Furthermore, 

the  S.  Typhimurium  monophasic  variants 
4,5,12:i:- , S. 43:d:- , S. Gatehead, S. Corvallis, S. Liverpool, S. Dakar 
and S. Kibusi serovars found only in humans are being reported for 
the  first  time  in  humans  in  Nigeria.  Human  infection  by  serovar 
4,5,12:i:-  (monophasic variant of S. Typhimurium) indicates the oc-
currence of this emerging epidemic pathogen in Nigeria thus war-
ranting surveillance.

The prevalence of rare serovars corroborates reports from some 
African  countries  (Harrois  et al.,  2014;  Osman  et al.,  2013), while  it 
contrasts  with  others  (Bonkoungou  et al.,  2013;  Langendorf  et al., 
2015;  Moyo  et al.,  2011),  suggesting  complex  epidemiology  of 
Salmonella in Africa which may complicate the control. The observed 
different  serovar  patterns  are  probably  a  reflection  of  local  climatic 
conditions, culture and animal husbandry.

The S. Colindale strains were divided into more than one MLST as 
a result of a single locus variation with a maximum pairwise- genome 
difference of 77 SNPs suggesting a monomorphic serovar like S. Typhi 
(Hendriksen et al., 2015); this conclusion should be taken with cau-
tion as good reference genome and more temporal and spatial strains 
(presently unavailable) are required for confirmation. Both S. Kentucky 
and S. Rubislaw strains were also divided into more than one MLST 
based on variation in one to two (S. Kentucky) and two to three (S. 
Rubislaw) loci suggesting polymorphic serovars. With the collection of 
contemporary strains of the serovars Kentucky and Rubislaw diverg-
ing greatly from the corresponding reference genome by 27,879 SNPs 
and 32,675 SNPs, respectively, it indicates polymorphic serovars.

Phylogenetic SNP analysis of Salmonella isolates of the shared se-
rovars (observed between cattle and humans) revealed circulation of 
different  genetic  populations  of  strains  indicating  lack  of  epidemio-
logical link; however, this requires confirmation by large contempora-
neous isolates. The genetic relatedness of the two human diarrhoeic 
isolates (HD 34E and HD 32D) separated by only five SNPs (Figure 1) 
indicates clonal dissemination.

The overall low prevalence of antimicrobial resistance is notewor-
thy; this coupled with the finding of rare Salmonella serovars suggests 
exposure from environment with less antimicrobial selective pressure 
such as reptiles.

These findings underscore the importance of cattle at harvest as 
an important reservoir of salmonellae; therefore, the sources of cattle 
infection need to be identified for targeted control measures. Cattle 
could be infected through feeds, water, grazing pasture and the envi-
ronment. Indiscriminate grazing of cattle in open and unhygienic pas-
ture and drinking of water from contaminated streams and rivers is 
common in this environment. Cattle are also allowed to stray on the 
streets  scavenging  domestic  and  market wastes.  Biosecurity  of  cat-
tle farms is also poor as they are bushy and not properly fenced to 
prevent infestation by small animals like rodents and reptiles coupled 
with poor hygienic condition of the farms. All these factors should be 
a focus of regulatory policies by appropriate Government Agencies to 
safeguard public health.

This study is limited by small sample size and evaluation of only 
some of the Salmonella isolates by WGST due to cost. Furthermore, 
one  faecal  sample  was  evaluated  per  individual  instead  of  multiple 
samples  which  enhances  isolation  of  Salmonella. The  time  span  be-
tween collection of animal and human samples could be responsible 
for  lack  of  clonal  clusters  formed  by  cattle  and  human  Salmonella 
isolates.

5 |  CONCLUSION

The study provides baseline data of Salmonella (human and cattle) 
prevalence, ST, antimicrobial resistance phenotypes and genetic re-
latedness, laying the framework for using WGS for source attribu-
tion in Nigeria, but more analysis is needed of Salmonella isolated 
from a broader array of sample types to further facilitate this ap-
plication of WGS. There is need for continuous antimicrobial resist-
ance surveillance.
