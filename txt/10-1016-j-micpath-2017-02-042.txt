MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTAbstract 

Salmonella  is  among  the  most  important  food  borne  pathogens  worldwide  contaminating  a 

wide  range  of  animal  products  including  meat  products.  The  aims  of  this  study  go  through 

two steps: The first step is to estimate the proportion of sausages products contaminated by 

Salmonella  in  Meknes  city  (Morocco),  which  were  collected  from  various  shopping  sites: 

butchery, street vendors, supermarket and souk (Weekly market combines the population of 

the small villages around Meknes city). The second one is to identify serovars, to determine 

the  antimicrobials  resistance  patterns  of  isolates  and  to  detect  the  invA  and  spvC  genes.  34 

(21.79%)  Salmonella  was  isolated,  recovered  4  serogroups  and  12  serotypes.  The  most 

prevalent serotypes were Salmonella Corvallis (23.53%) and Salmonella Kentucky (17.65%). 

All  Salmonella  isolates  were  tested  for  their  susceptibility  to  18  selected  antimicrobials 

agents,  of  which  100%  were  resistant  to  at  least  one  antimicrobial,  85.30%  (29/34)  were 

resistant  to  two  or  more  antimicrobials  and  44.12%  (15/34)  were  resistant  to  at  least  three 

antimicrobials. All Salmonella are resistant to ampicillin, 76.47% to streptomycin, 20.59% to 

sulphonamides,  17.65%  to  Tetracycline  and  11.77%  to  Ofloxacin.  The  ''ACSSuT''  penta-

resistance pattern was observed in tow of the  Salmonella Typhimurium strains.  In  addition, 

our  this  study  showed  that  all  Salmonella  strains  (34)  were  positive  for  invasion  gene  invA 

and negative for the virulence gene spvC.

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTIntroduction  

Food-borne diseases imposes a substantial economic burden and threatens the public health 

on  society  causing  an  acute  morbidity  and  chronic  sequelae  [1,2].  Worldwide,  the 

consumption  of  contaminated  food  is  responsible  for  two  million  deaths  per  year  [3]. 

Furthermore, the non-typhoidal Salmonella is the main cause of food-borne diseases, which 

pose  a  big  problem  for  medicine  and  agribusiness;  it’s  associated  in  most  cases  with  the 

consumption of animal products [4,5]. However, some studies show that even of plant origin 

may be a vector for transmission of Salmonella to humans [6,7]. 

Worldwide, Salmonella is responsible for the millions cases of foodborne diseases each year 

[8]. The incidence of salmonellosis ranged between 14.53 and 17.55 cases per 100,000 people 

in  the  United  States  [9].  Moreover,  Salmonella  was  the  second  most  commonly  reported 

zoonoses  in  the  European  Union  with  a  total  of  91,034  confirmed  cases  of  human 

salmonellosis in 2012 [10]. The true incidence of salmonellosis in both humans and animals is 

difficult  to  evaluate  in  developing  countries  because  of  the  lack  of  epidemiological 

surveillance  systems  [11].  The  bacterial  resistance  to  antimicrobial  agents,  including 

Salmonella is a major problem of food safety; it affects both the veterinary and public health 

by transfer of resistant strains to humans through the food chain [12,13]. The multi-resistant 

strains  can  sometimes  be  the  cause  of  international  outbreaks  raising  fears  therapeutic 

impasses and increased morbidity and mortality for simple food poisoning [4]. 

In  Morocco,  the  consumption  of  meat  products  has  experienced  a  sharp  increase  in  recent 

years and the presence of Salmonella in these products is usual [14–16], which increases the 

population exposure to the pathogenic agent. Also, the manufacture of sausages is done under 

conditions that do not comply with good hygiene practices. In Meknes city, sausages are sold 

in supermarkets, butchery, street vendors and souk. The street vendors are located mainly in 

neighborhoods,  they  have  generally  a  very  low  cultural  level  and  are  unconscious  of  good 

 

3 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPThygiene  practices  and  work  in  illegal  conditions  without  control  and  without  regulatory 

legislation. As regards the souk, sausages are presented on parts in contact with air and dust at 

ambient  temperatures,  without  any  respect  for  good  hygiene  practices.  Those  who  make  a 

deadly food and a potential transmission vector of pathogenic bacteria to humans. 

The  aim  of  this  study  is  to  determine  the  prevalence  of  Salmonella  in  sausages  made  from 

beef meat, turkey meat  and artisanal sausages  "Merguez" trades in Meknes city  (Morocco), 

using  the  conventional  method,  by  biochemical  and  serological  means.  The  molecular 

identification  confirmation  by  PCR  was  performed  to  detect  the  invA  and  spvC  genes.  The 

sensitivity  and  resistance  of  Salmonella  to  antimicrobials  agents  were  studied.  It  should  be 

mentioned that "Merguez" is a small raw sausage generally made of lean and fat beef mixed 

with  condiments  and  stuffed  into  natural  casings  of  sheep  and  beef;  it  is  generally  sold  in 

street vendors.  

Material and methods 

1. Samples Collections    

From March 2014 until February 2015, 156 samples of sausages (60 of Turkey sausages, 60 

of Beef sausages, 36 of Artisanal sausages "Merguez") were collected from various sites: 72 

from  butchery,  36  from  street  vendors,  24  from  Supermarket  and  24  from  Souk  (Weekly 

market) in Meknes city in Morocco, with a frequency of 13 samples per month (5 of Turkey 

sausages, 5 of Beef sausages, 3 of Artisanal sausages "Merguez"). The collected amount of 

each  sample  of  sausage  is  about  40  grams,  which  they  were  transferred  immediately  in  a 

cooler to microbiology laboratory at the Faculty of Science Meknes. 

 2. Isolation of Salmonella 

25  g  Twenty-five  grams  of  sausages  were  pre-enriched  into  225  mL  of  sterile  buffered 

peptone  water  (Oxoid,  England)  and  incubated  at  37°C  for  18  to  24  hours.  0.1  mL  of  pre-

enrichment culture was inoculated into 10 mL of Rappaport-Vassiliadis broth (Biokar) and 1 

 

4 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTmL  was  inoculated  into  10  mL  of  Selenite  Cysteine  Broth  (Biokar),  the  cultures  were 

incubated  at  42°C  and  37°C,  respectively,  for  24  hours.  From  them,  a  streak  culture  is 

performed  on  Hektoen  enteric  agar  (Biokar)  and  Salmonella-Shigella  agar  (Biokar), 

respectively; the inoculated plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. The suspect colonies 

of  Salmonella  were  inoculated  into  Hanja  Kligler  agar  (Biokar),  Simmons  citrate  agar 

(Oxoid), mannitol motility agar (Bio-Rad), lysine decarboxylase broth (Scharlab), Indole urea 

(bio  Merieux  RSA)  and  incubated  at  37°C  for  18  to  24  hours.  The  oxidase  discs  (in  vitro 

diagnostics) and ONPG (Oxoid Limited) are also tested. All the isolates were confirmed by 

biochemical tests using an API 20E (Bio Mérieux RSA). 

 3. Molecular identification of Salmonella 

All  Salmonella  strains  collected  in  this  study  were  tested  for  the  invasion  gene  invA  and 

virulence  gene  spvC  (Table  1),  using  the  conventional  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  as 

described by Karraouan et al. [15]. 

 4. Determination of Salmonella Serogroup and Serotype 

The serogroup and serovars of the Salmonella isolates were determined by slide agglutination 

tests with O antigen and H antigen antiserums obtained from Pasteur Institute of Casablanca 

city in Morocco. The results were interpreted according to the Kauffmann-White scheme [17]. 

 5. Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing 

The  agar  dilution  method  with  Mueller-Hinton  agar  was  used  to  test  the  susceptibility  of 

Salmonella  to  18  antimicrobials  (Table  2).  The  results  were  interpreted  according  to  the 

recommendation  of  the  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards  Institute  [18].  In  this  study,  the 

isolates showing a decrease in susceptibility (intermediate) were considered as resistant and 

Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was used as control strains. 

Results 

1. Prevalence of Salmonella in sausage samples 

 

5 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTSalmonella  was  detected  in  21.79%  (34/156)  of  samples.  Artisanal  sausages  "Merguez"  are 

the  most  contaminated  30.55%  (11/36),  followed  by  Turkey  sausages  23.33%  (14/60)  and 

Beef sausages 15% (9/60). Considering the area of marketing, sausages sold in Street Vendors 

are  the  most  contaminated  (30.55%),  followed  by  souk  (29.16%),  butchery  (18.05%)  and 

supermarket  (12.5%).  Invasion  gene  operon  invA  was  detected  in  all  Salmonella  isolates  in 

our this study. However, spvC was not detected in any strain (Figure 1). 

2. Determination of serogroups and Serotypes of isolated Salmonella 

The  diversity  of  raw  material  and  the  conditions  of  manufacturing  sausages  influence  the 

distribution  of serogroups  and  serotypes.  In  this  study,  4  serogroups  and  12  serotypes  were 

identified  in  34  Salmonella  isolates  with  an  abundance  of  Salmonella  and  Salmonella 

Kentucky (Table 3). 

3. The antimicrobial susceptibility of isolated Salmonella 

From  the  total  of  34  Salmonella  isolates  evaluated  for  resistance  against  18  selected 

antimicrobial  agents  (Table  4),  all  Salmonella  tested  (100%)  are  resistant  to  at  least  one 

antimicrobial, 85.30% (29/34) are resistant to two or more antimicrobials and 44.12% (15/34) 

are  resistant  to  three  or  more  antimicrobials  (Table  5).  The  analysis  of  antimicrobials 

susceptibility  showed  four  strains  (4/34)  of  Salmonella  Kentucky  are  resistant 

to 

fluoroquinolone  and  two  strains  (2/34)  of  Salmonella  Typhimurium  are  resistant  to  five 

antimicrobials  agents  (Tetracycline,  Sulfonamides,  Streptomycin,  Chloramphenicol,  and 

Amoxycillin). and the absence of beta-lactamase extended spectrum (ESBL). 

Discussion 

The  prevalence  of  Salmonella  in  sausages  is  21.79%  (34/156).  It’s  in  agreement  to  those 

reported  in  Brazil  (24.4%)  [19]  and  Botswana  (26%)  [20].  However,  this  value  is  less  than 

that found in Algeria (46.77%) [21] and higher than that found in Morocco (0.097%) [6] and 

Italy  (3.5%)  [22].  A  study  done  in  Tunisia  showed  the  absence  of  Salmonella  in  Merguez

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTsausages [23]. This comparison should be made  with suspicion, because  the results may be 

influenced by several factors such as the level of development between different countries, the 

location and climate of the sites, the origin of the raw material used, the sampling seasons, the 

hygienic quality of production units and isolation methods. 

The  origin  of  the  raw  material  influences  the  risk  of  contamination  of  sausages.  Artisanal 

sausages "Merguez" are the most contaminated by Salmonella (30.55%), followed by Turkey 

sausages  (23.33%)  and  Beef  sausages  (15%).  This  difference  can  be  explained  by  the 

precarious  health  conditions  of  preparation  and  sale  of  Artisanal  sausages  "Merguez", 

including cross-contamination offal and raw material can occur. Furthermore, turkey meat is 

generally  considered  a  very  important  reservoir  for  Salmonella  contamination  [15,16,24]; 

other  studies  have  shown  the  presence  of  Salmonella  in  beef  meat  products  [25–28].  This 

contamination increases all along the production chain, because of cross-contamination during 

slaughter, cutting and further processing [29]. So it’s important to monitor the occurrence of 

Salmonella throughout the production chain, in order to avoid the contamination of finished 

products. 

The present study shows a wide distribution of Salmonella serotypes due to the diversity of 

the  raw  material,  the  conditions  of  preparation,  storage  and  distribution  modality.  Twelve 

serotypes were identified; Salmonella Corvallis (23.53%) and Salmonella Kentucky (17.65%) 

are  the  most  abundant.  In  Morocco  Salmonella  Corvallis  was  detected  in  food  [30]  and 

ground turkey [15], Salmonella Kentucky was isolated in turkey carcasses [16] and food [31]. 

However, these serotypes differ from those published in other studies [6,14]. 

The  increase  and  accumulation  of  the  antimicrobials  resistance  in  pathogenic  bacteria  are  a 

major  public  health  problem,  thus  Salmonella  acquires  their  resistance  to  multiple 

antimicrobial  agents  in  animals  farm  before  being  transmitted  to  humans  through  the  food 

chain [5]. Several studies in livestock farms showed the presence of Salmonella resistant to 

 

7 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTmultiple antimicrobials [5,32–34], other studies have shown the relationship between the use 

of antimicrobial agents in the veterinary field and humans and increased bacterial resistance 

[35].  

Our  This  study  indicates  that  100%  of  isolated  Salmonella  were  resistant  to  at  least  one 

antimicrobial; these results are higher than those found previously in Morocco (75.43%) [14], 

and  those  recorded  in  Algeria  (90.32%)  [21],  Tunisia  (20%)  [23],  Italy  (84.2%)  [28]  and 

China  (74%)  [36].  85.30%  (29/34)  of  isolated  Salmonella  are  resistant  to  two  or  more 

antimicrobials and 44.12% (15/34) are resistant to three or more antimicrobials. These results 

are  superior  to  those  found  in  Botswana  (20.3%)  [20],  and  but  lower  than  those  found  in 

Egypt (100%) [26]. 

The rate of resistance to streptomycin and tetracycline was 76.47% and 17.65%, respectively, 

the resistance to these antimicrobials is common in Salmonella isolates and has been observed 

previously in Morocco [14], Algeria [21], Tunisia [23], Egypt [37], Iran [38], Malaysia [39] 

and  China  [29].  The  low  percentage  of  tetracycline  resistance  compared  to  that  of 

streptomycin, can be explained by the prohibition of the use of this drug in poultry farms and 

cattle.  The  amount  of  the  sulfonamides  resistance  is  significant  (20.5%)  and  could  be  the 

result  of  widespread  use  of  these  antimicrobials  in  livestock;  this  result  is  lower  than  that 

found  in  Morocco  (64.1%)  [15]  and  Algeria  (90.32%)  [21],  but  higher  than  that  found  in 

Tunisia (1.2%) [23].  

The  rate  of  resistance  to  ofloxacin  is  11.77%,  this  antimicrobial  belonging  to  the 

fluoroquinolone;  it’s  used  in  the  treatment  of  severe  salmonellosis  cases  for  adults  [4]. 

Unfortunately, Salmonella isolates were found resistant to other fluoroquinolone in Morocco 

[15,16],  Sudan  [40],  Algeria  [21],  Tunisia  [41]  and  China  [29].  However,  the  resistance  of 

Salmonella to this such as antimicrobial has a potentially negative impact on human health. 

 

8 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTTwo  serotypes  of  Salmonella  Typhimurium  are  resistant  to  ceftriaxone  (5.88%),  an 

antimicrobial that belongs to the third generation cephalosporins, it’s used in the treatment of 

salmonellosis  cases  in  children  [4].  Other  studies  have  also  reported  the  resistance  of 

Salmonella  to  the  same  antimicrobials  family  [36,42].  The  resistance  to  chloramphenicol  is 

detected in 5.88% of isolates, it should be noted that the chloramphenicol, have not been used 

in  breeding  for  many  years,  this  resistance  may  be  due  to  cross-resistance  or  co-resistance 

mechanisms. 

Conclusion  

In this study, the high levels of contamination of sausages with Salmonella and the detection 

of several serotypes highlight the poor hygiene all along the chain of manufacture and sale of 

this product. Furthermore, our results indicate the widespread presence of Salmonella strains 

resistant  to  antimicrobials:  the  resistance  of  Salmonella  Typhimurium  ''ACSSuT''  and  the 

resistance  of  Salmonella  Kentucky  to  Ofloxacin.  So  it’s  time  to  monitor,  control  and 

rationalize  the  use  of  antimicrobial  agents  in  livestock  animals,  to  preserve  the  efficacy  of 

existing drugs and to prevent the acquisition and increased resistance to recent molecules in 

order  to  fight  against  the  vertical  and  horizontal  transfer  of  multidrug  resistant  strains.  It 

should be stressed also the need to implement proactive measures in hygiene practices and the 

application  of  Hazard  Analysis  Critical  Control  Point  (HACCP)  in  the  preparation  and 

manufacturing of sausages, for reducing Salmonella contamination and the risk of food-borne 

diseases.

Highlights  

 

 

The theme in this work is related to the hygienic quality and contamination with Salmonella, in 

sausages marketed in the city of Meknes in Morocco. The prevalence, determining antibiotic 

resistance profile, biochemical identification, serological and research of invA virulence gene were 

performed and determined. 

•  Salmonella was detected in 34 of the 156 samples (21.79%). 

•  Four  serogroups  and  12  serotypes  were  identified;  Salmonella  Corvallis  and  Salmonella 

Kentucky were most prevalent. 

•  Multidrug resistance was found among the 15 (44.12%) Salmonella isolates. 

•  The  ''ACSSuT''  penta-resistance  pattern  was  observed  in  tow  strains  of  the  Salmonella 

typhimurium. 

•  The resistance to Ofloxacin was observed in 4 strains of the Salmonella Kentucky 

 

•  All Salmonella strains collected were tested for the virulence genes invA and spvC using the 

conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
