ABSTRACT

We report the prevalence of extended-spectrum b-lactamases and carbapenemases in Escherichia coli isolated from retail
chicken in Peshawar, Pakistan. One hundred E. coli isolates were recovered from retail chicken. Antibiotic susceptibility testing
was carried out against ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, cephalothin, gentamicin, sulfamethoxazole-
trimethoprim, and streptomycin. Phenotypic detection of b-lactamase production was analyzed through double disc synergy test
using the antibiotics amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, and aztreonam. Fifty multidrug-resistant isolates
were screened for detection of sul1, aadA, cmlA, int, blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M, blaOXA-10, blaVIM, blaIMP, and blaNDM-1 genes.
Resistance to ampicillin, nalidixic acid, kanamycin, streptomycin, cephalothin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, gentamicin,
cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, cefepime, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and chloramphenicol was 92, 91, 84, 73, 70, 67, 53, 48,
40, 39, 37, 36, and 23% respectively. Prevalence of sul1, aadA, cmlA, int, blaTEM, blaCTX-M, blaIMP, and blaNDM-1 was 78% (n¼
39), 76% (n¼ 38), 20% (n¼ 10), 90% (n¼ 45), 74% (n¼ 37), 94% (n¼ 47), 22% (n¼ 11), and 4% (n¼ 2), respectively. blaSHV,
blaOXA-10, and blaVIM were not detected. The coexistence of multiple antibiotic resistance genes in multidrug-resistant strains of
E. coli is alarming. Hence, robust surveillance strategies should be developed with a focus on controlling the spread of antibiotic
resistance genes via the food chain.

Antibiotics are frequently used in poultry farming, and
bacteria could develop resistance against them by evolving
various mechanisms (17): changes in the antibiotic target
sites, acquisition of antibiotic inactivating enzymes, evolu-
tion of drug efﬂux systems, or making the cell
less
permeable to antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance genes could
be transferred among different bacterial species through
transposons, integrons, and plasmids (17). Foods contami-
nated with resistant bacteria could have a role in the spread
of resistance genes. These resistant bacteria could disrupt the
normal body ﬂora, making the host more vulnerable to
infections (4). Escherichia coli can act as a vehicle for
transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. These bacteria are
diverse and are normally present in the gastrointestinal tract
of humans, poultry, and other animals. However, certain
pathogenic strains of E. coli cause both nosocomial and
community-acquired infections, leading to deadly outbreaks
(37). Resistant E. coli strains could be transmitted to humans

through the food chain, causing serious health-related issues
(29).

The major classes of antibiotics include quinolones,
oxazolidinones, b-lactams, glycopeptides, b-lactamase in-
hibitors, lipopeptides, treptogramins, sulfonamides, macro-
lides, and rifamycins. b-Lactamase enzymes are produced
by bacteria to neutralize the effect of b-lactam antibiotics.
Production of b-lactamases is the main resistance mecha-
nism found in Enterobacteriaceae. Extended-spectrum b-
lactamases (ESBLs) are b-lactamases that provide resistance
against a number of b-lactam antibiotics (8). Many of the
ESBLs are derivatives of blaTEM or blaSHV enzymes (9). So
far, more than 600 ESBLs have been identiﬁed (7). The most
important of them are blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaCTX-M (21).
The b-lactam antibiotics called carbapenems are used as
the last therapeutic option against resistant gram-negative
bacteria; however, some strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae
and E. coli have evolved resistance mechanisms against
them (32, 47). Resistance to carbapenems was ﬁrst observed
in the United States in 1996 and, later, globally (32). The
most important resistance mechanisms against carbapenems
involve production of carbapenemase enzymes such as K.

pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), oxacillinase (OXA-48),
Verona integron-encoded metallo-b-lactamase (VIM), imi-
penemase metallo-b-lactamase (IMP), and New Delhi
metallo-b-lactamase (NDM)
(31). Bacteria that produce
these enzymes have been isolated from hospital-acquired
infections and domestic animals (47). The exact origin of
carbapenemases is not completely understood; however,
environmental bacteria are considered to be potential
sources (44). NDM is an important carbapenemase that
hydrolyzes b-lactams and last therapeutic option carbape-
nems. Only a few antibiotics, such as colistin, fosfomycin,
and tigecycline, are effective against NDM-producing
bacteria (14).

Chicken is a main source of protein in Pakistan. The
emergence of resistant bacteria in poultry is a major health
issue that could lead to spread of these bacteria to the human
population, causing noncurable infections. This spread of
resistance bacteria could occur through consumption of
undercooked meat or meat products, cross-contamination,
direct contact with contaminated meat, or
through the
environment, e.g.,
the release of contaminated poultry
carcasses into fresh water. Few data are available on the
prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in chicken-borne
pathogens in the region. Hence, for proper management, it is
relevant
to analyze the occurrence of chicken-related
resistant bacteria and their development mechanisms. This
study analyzed the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes
in E. coli isolated from chicken in Peshawar, Pakistan. To
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report on the prevalance of
antibiotic resistance genes (and the ﬁrst ever on the existence
of NDM-1) in E. coli isolated from chicken.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sampling and isolation. One hundred raw chicken meat
samples (leg and breast) and intestinal samples (small intestine)
were collected from retail shops in different locations of Peshawar
during 2015 and 2016. Isolation and identiﬁcation were carried out
following standard procedures (13, 35). Brieﬂy, samples were
collected in sterile bags and transferred to a laboratory immedi-
ately. Samples were prepared in peptone water, and serial dilutions
were made. Each serial dilution (100 lL) was inoculated onto
MacConkey agar (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK), followed by incuba-
tion at 378C for 24 h. A total of 100 isolates were selected. The
isolates were identiﬁed through morphological screening (Gram
staining) and biochemical
tests, e.g., catalase, oxidase, citrate,
indole, motility, triple sugar iron, methyl red, and Voges-Proskauer
tests and through the results of growth on eosin methylene blue
agar (35). One isolate was selected from each sample for analysis.

Antibiotic susceptibility. Antibiotic susceptibility was per-
formed using the Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method, according to
the recommendations of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (11, 12). Antibiotic susceptibility was performed against
(CAM; 30 lg), ampicillin (AMP; 10 lg),
chloramphenicol
kanamycin (KAN; 30 lg), cephalothin (CET; 30 lg), nalidixic
acid (NX; 30 lg), gentamicin (GEN; 10 lg), streptomycin (STR;
10 lg), and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (TMP-SMX; 25 lg).

Phenotypic ESBL detection. Phenotypic detection of ESBLs
was carried out using the double disc synergy test (22). The
antibiotics amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMC; 30 lg), cefotaxime

(CTX; 30 lg), ceftazidime (CAZ; 30 lg), cefepime (FEP; 30
lg), and aztreonam (ATM; 30 lg) were used for ESBL assays.
Bacterial innoculum was spread on Mueller-Hinton agar (Oxoid).
A disc of AMC was placed in the center. The remaining antibiotics
were placed 15 to 20 mm apart from the AMC disc, followed by
incubation at 378C overnight and measurement of the inhibition
zones.

Detection of non–b-lactam antibiotic resistance genes and
class 1 integrase gene. Fifty multidrug-resistant (resistant to three
or more antibiotics) E. coli isolates were selected for detection of
antibiotic resistance genes. Genomic and plasmid DNA was
isolated as reported (46). Three non–b-lactam antibiotic resistance
genes, i.e., sul1 (sulfonamide), aadA (aminoglycoside), and cmlA
(chloramphenicol), and int (class 1 integrase) were detected using
speciﬁc primers for each gene (45). A 25-lL PCR reaction volume
consisted of 12.5 lL of 23 SuperHot master mix (cat. no. 119102,
Bioron, http://www.mountbio.com/pdf%20ﬁles/BIORON%20E-
Catalogue.pdf), 1 lL of template DNA, 1 lL of primer (0.5
lM), and 9.5 lL of molecular-grade water. PCR reaction
conditions consisted of initial denaturation (958C, 5 min) followed
by 30 cycles of denaturation (948C, 30 s), annealing (508C, 30 s),
and extension (728C, 1 min), followed by ﬁnal extension (728C, 7
min). Gel electrophoresis of PCR products was carried out using
1.5% agarose gel and a 100-bp DNA ladder (cat. no. 304105,
Bioron) as the size marker.

Detection of ESBL genes. Prevalence of four ESBL genes,
i.e., blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M, and blaOXA-10, was analyzed using
speciﬁc primers (16, 36, 45). PCR reaction mixture for blaTEM,
blaCTX-M, and blaOXA-10 consisted of similar composition as used
for non–b-lactam genes. A 20-lL PCR reaction volume for blaSHV
consisted of 4 lL of 53 FIREPol master mix (cat. no. 04-12-
00125, Solis BioDyne, Tartu, Estonia), 1 lL of DNA, 1 lL of
primer (0.5 lM), and 13 lL of molecular-grade water. The
ampliﬁcation proﬁle for blaTEM was the same as used for non–b-
lactam genes. Ampliﬁcation proﬁle for blaSHV, blaCTX-M, and
blaOXA-10 consisted of initial denaturation (958C, 5 min) followed
by 30 cycles of denaturation (948C, 1 min), annealing (608C, 1
min for blaSHV; 558C, 1 min for blaCTX-M; and 578C, 1 min for
blaOXA-10), and extension (728C, 1 min),
followed by ﬁnal
extension (728C, 5 min). Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical
isolates positive for these genes were used as controls.

Detection of carbapenemases genes. Prevalence of three
i.e., blaVIM, blaIMP, and blaNDM-1, was
carbapenemase genes,
analyzed using speciﬁc primers (36, 42). PCR reaction mix
composition was the same as used for non–b-lactam genes.
Ampliﬁcation conditions for blaVIM and blaIMP included initial
denaturation (958C, 5 min) followed by 30 cycles of denaturation
(948C, 1 min), annealing (568C, 1 min for blaVIM; 548C, 1 min for
blaIMP), and extension (728C, 1 min), followed by ﬁnal extension
(728C, 5 min). The ampliﬁcation proﬁle for blaNDM-1 consisted of
initial denaturation (958C, 5 min) followed by 35 cycles of
denaturation (948C, 30 s), annealing (558C, 40 s), and extension
(728C, 50 s), followed by ﬁnal extension (728C, 5 min).

CARBAPENEMASES AND ESBL-PRODUCING E. COLI FROM CHICKEN MEAT

23%, respectively. Phenotypically, ESBL production was
conﬁrmed in 32 isolates. Eight antibiotic resistance genes
int, blaTEM, blaCTX-M, blaIMP, and
(sul1, aadA, cmlA,
blaNDM-1) were detected in the isolates (Table 1). The sizes
of ampliﬁed products corresponding to sul1, aadA, cmlA,
int, blaTEM, blaCTX-M, blaNDM-1, and blaIMP genes were 822,
284, 698, 250, 857, 552, 475, and 361 bp, respectively.
Multiple antibiotic resistance genes were present in all the
isolates. The prevalence of sul1 gene was 78% (n ¼ 39)
(Table 1). The aadA gene was present in 76% (n ¼ 38) of
isolates, the cmlA gene in 20% (n ¼ 10) of isolates, and the
int gene in 90% (n¼ 45) of isolates (Table 1). The frequency
of blaTEM, blaCTX-M, blaIMP, and blaNDM-1 genes was 74%
(n ¼ 37), 94% (n ¼ 47), 22% (n ¼ 11), and 4% (n ¼ 2),
respectively (Table 1). The genes blaSHV, blaOXA-10, and
blaVIM were not detected. One isolate (I56) from intestinal
samples harbored all eight genes detected in the current
study and showed phenotypic resistance to 11 different
antibiotics (Table 1). One isolate (I44) possessed seven
different antibiotic genes and had resistance to 10 different
antibiotics (Table 1). Three isolates (F16, I3, and I11)
possessed six different antibiotic resistance genes, and 23
isolates carried ﬁve different antibiotic genes (Table 1). The
occurrence of blaNDM-1 was observed for the ﬁrst time in 2
chicken intestinal isolates (I53 and I56).

Among the 50 isolates analyzed for detection of
antibiotic resistance genes, sulfonamide resistance was
detected in 39 isolates (78%) phenotypically, and the sul1
gene was also detected in 39 isolates, which showed a good
correlation between phenotypic and genotypic data (Table
1). However, among the 39 genotypically resistant isolates,
5 were phenotypically sensitive. Similarly, 6 isolates showed
phenotypic resistance and no genotypic resistance that could
be due to involvement of different
resistance genes.
Phenotypic resistance to aminoglycosides also corelated
well with genotypic resistance (aadA gene) because 38
isolates showed both phenotypic and genotypic resistance
(Table 1). However, 12 isolates showed phenotypic
resistance, but not genotypic resistance that could be due
to the presence of other
resistance genes. Correlation
between the presence of the cmlA gene and phenotypic
resistance to chloramphenicol was weak: only 5 of 10
genotypically positive isolates showed phenotypic resis-
tance, whereas 12 other isolates showed only phenotypic
resistance (Table 1). Phenotypic resistance against b-lactam
antibiotics correlated well with the occurrence of b-
lactamase genes because all phenotypically resistant isolates
showed the presence of at least one b-lactamase gene (Table
1).

DISCUSSION

Foodborne diseases are a global health issue. In the
current study, a high prevalence of multidrug resistance was
observed in E. coli
isolates of chicken origin. The
prevalence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms in food
and animal samples has been reported across the world (2,
3). Akbar et al. (1) reported 92% resistance to ampicillin, as
in the current study. Another study from Bangladesh
reported a high frequency of streptomycin (70%) and
kanamycin (76%) resistance in E. coli of poultry origin

(30). The ﬁndings of Salehi and Bonab (41) were strikingly
similar to those in this study:
i.e., 100% resistance to
nalidixic acid, 81% resistance to streptomycin, 80%
resistance to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, and 77%
resistance to kanamycin.

In the current study, the occurrence of non–b-lactam
antibiotic resistance genes (sul1, aadA, and cmlA) and the
integrase gene (int) was observed. Existence of these genes
in E. coli of chicken origin has been reported by other
authors (3, 27). A previous study reported 36.84%
prevalence of cmlA and 47.36% prevalence of sul1 gene in
E. coli isolated from chicken (30). In the current study, the
int gene was found in 90% of isolates. These results are in
agreement with the ﬁndings of Altalhi et al. (3). Integrons
play an important role in the spread of resistance genes
among bacteria (49).

Resitance to b-lactam antibiotics was observed in the
current study. Similar results have been reported previously
(29). A study from Turkey reported a low prevalence of
ESBL and AmpC b-lactamases among E. coli isolates from
chicken meat and fecal samples (24). In the current study,
the prevalence of blaTEM was 72% and that of blaCTX-M was
94%, ﬁndings similar to those of a previous study (3).
Another study reported 24.3% prevalence of blaTEM among
E. coli
isolates (27). In Gemany, 43.9% prevalence of
ESBLs in enterobacteria isolated from retail chicken meat
was noticed (39). Presence of blaCTX-M in E. coli from
chicken was reported for the ﬁrst time in Spain in 2001 (6).
Since then, various studies have reported the occurrence of
blaCTX-M–producing E. coli from chicken (20, 25, 50). A
study from France reported 10.7% occurrence of blaCTX-M
in E. coli collected from chicken (19). Another study from
China reported 12.3% prevalence of blaCTX-M in chicken E.
coli
isolates (50). In Hong Kong, a higher prevalence
(68.5%) of blaCTX-M in E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae
isolates from fecal chicken samples was observed (20). In
Germany, 40% prevalence of blaCTX-M was observed in
retail chicken meat (25). Another study from Germany
reported 60% prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli, mainly
possessing blaCTX-M and blaSHV genes (10). In Spain, the
prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli was found to have
signiﬁcantly increased from 62.5% in 2007 to 93.5% in
2010, with blaSHV as the dominant type of ESBL detected
(15). Stuart et al. (43) carried out a comparative study of
ESBL prevalence in organic and conventional retail chicken
meat. Both the meat samples (organic and conventional) had
ESBL-producing bacteria, although organic meat samples
had comparatively lower prevalence of blaCTX-M, blaSHV,
and blaTEM. Leverstein-van Hall et al. (26) conducted a
comparative study of E. coli strains, ESBL genes, and
plasmids in Dutch patients, chicken meat, and poultry that
pointed to a possible dissemination of resistant bacteria,
ESBL genes, and plasmids from poultry to human via the
food chain. They found poultry-associated ESBL genes in
35% of human isolates. Interestingly, 19% of these ESBL
genes were located on the same plasmids in both poultry and
human isolates. The dominant ESBL genes were blaCTX-M
and blaTEM in isolates from all the three sources (Dutch
patients, chicken meat, and poultry). The occurrence of

ESBL-producing E. coli was 94%; of these, 39% belonged
to the same genotypes that were present in human samples.
In the current study, two carbapenemases, blaIMP and
blaNDM-1, were also detected with 10 and 4% prevalence.
Carbapenem resistance in Enterobacteriaceae has been
reported worldwide, with blaKPC-2 and blaNDM-1 as
important resistance genes (23, 33). NDM was ﬁrst reported
in E. coli and K. pneumoniae that were isolated from a
Swedish patient who was once hospitalized in New Delhi
(48). The enzyme has been reported in members of
Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter spe-
cies across the world (5, 23, 40). However,
to our
knowledge, blaNDM-1 has not been previously reported in
E. coli from chicken. Carbapenems are not routinely used in
poultry farming; however, blaNDM-1 production could have
coevolved along with resistance to other antibiotics such as
tetracyclines, cephalosporins, and quinolones, which are
commonly used in the poultry industry. These resistant
strains could be further disseminated through direct contact,
insect vectors, and other animals, as has been suggested
previously (18, 28, 38). The reverse scenario, i.e., human to
chicken transmission, could spread through infected human
carriers or wastewater discharge. The results of this study

clearly show that raw chicken sold at markets in Pakistan is
contaminated with E. coli that possesses multiple resistance
genes. These bacteria could have a role in the spread of
infections upon consumption of contaminated chicken meat
and meat products. These ﬁndings are alarming and
highlight serious health risks to both workers and consum-
ers. The spread of these resistant bacteria could lead to
deadly infections and epidemics (34). Currently, no
antibiotic resistance monitoring program in animals is in
place in Pakistan. Such monitoring systems should be
established for routine surveillance of resistance-associated
issues to prevent spread of this resistance to the human
population.
