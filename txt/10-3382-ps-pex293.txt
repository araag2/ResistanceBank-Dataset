ABSTRACT
foodborne
pathogen that causes zoonotic disease worldwide. The
aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence
of antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella isolated from
turkey farms in Taiwan. During the past 2 yr, 243
strains of Salmonella were isolated from 2,040 samples
(11.9%) from turkey farms, including 32.5% (52/160)
from the intestines of 12-day-old turkey poults, 14.2%
(119/840) from feces collected from the turkey growing
periods, and 6.9% (72/1,040) from finishing periods.
S. Albany (35.0%, 85/243), S. Schwarzengrund (23.0%,
56/243), and S. Hadar (19.3%, 47/243) were the most
common serovars on turkey farms. For these strains, a
high frequency of resistance was observed against flor-
fenicol (97.5%), oxytetracycline (89.3%), doxycycline

(78.6%), colistin (77.8%), ampicillin (75.7%), amoxi-
cillin (75.3%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (73.7%),
chloramphenicol (69.1%), and nalidixic acid (67.9%).
floR (63.8%), tet (A) (60.5%), blaPSE (57.6%), blaTEM
(42.0%), blaCTX-M (34.2%), cmlA (34.2%), and tet (D)
(29.2%) were the most common resistance genes found
in this study. The int1 gene was identified in 72.4%
(176/243) of Salmonella isolates in which the conserved
region 3’ of class 1 integrons also was amplified, whereas
none had the int2 gene. This study demonstrates that
imported and fattening turkeys could be a reservoir
for Salmonella isolates resistant to multiple antimicro-
bials. These results also reinforce the need to develop
strategies and implement specific control procedures to
reduce the development of antimicrobial resistance.

INTRODUCTION

Salmonella spp.

is distributed worldwide and can
cause salmonellosis in both animals and humans. In
humans, Salmonella spp. is one of the most common
pathogens causing bacterial foodborne diseases, while
in animals, salmonellosis is a common zoonotic dis-
ease worldwide. In recent years, S. Heidelberg iso-
lated from turkey products caused nationwide out-
breaks in the United States, resulting in 78 cases of
infection and a recall of up to 3.8 million pounds of
turkey products (CDC, 2011). In turkey, S. Pullorum, S.
Gallinarum, and S. Arizonae are more pathogenic, while
infections caused by other Salmonella serotypes are col-
lectively referred to as paratyphoid infections (Barrow,
2000; Quinn et al., 2011). In poults that have paraty-
phoid infections, clinical signs such as diarrhea, enteri-
tis, and septicemia can be observed, whereas in adult
turkeys, paratyphoid infections often lead to subclinical
symptoms (Quinn et al., 2011). The common serotypes

of turkey origin causing human infections are usually
paratyphoid Salmonella,
including S. Heidelberg, S.
Hadar, and S. Stanley (Hafez and Jodas, 2000; Saif et
al., 2008; CDC, 2011).

A variety of antimicrobials are used in poultry for
disease control, prophylaxis, and growth promotion
(Stavric and D’Aoust, 1993; Khachatourians, 1998).
Indiscriminate use of antimicrobials in food animals
has resulted in the emergence of multiple antibiotic-
resistant strains of
foodborne pathogens, such as
Salmonella, Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter, as
well as bacteria endogenous to the microfloras of an-
imals (Davis et al., 1999; van den Bogaard and Stob-
beringh, 1999). In particular, Salmonella isolates from
turkeys have been associated with high levels of an-
timicrobial resistance or multidrug resistance, with
studies indicating resistance is even more frequent in
Salmonella isolates from turkeys than in other livestock
species (Schroeter et al., 1998; Zhao et al., 2007, Poppe
et al., 2005).

Salmonella spp. acquire antibiotic resistance by ran-
dom chromosomal mutations, mutation of existing
genes, and through mobile genetic elements, such as
plasmids, transposons, and gene cassettes in inte-
grons, facilitating the acquisition and dissemination of
resistance genes (Okolo, 1986; Recchia and Hall, 1995;

2

YEH ET AL.

Fluit and Shmitz, 1999). The resistance gene cassettes
carried by integrons can be transferred horizontally to
other bacteria through conjugative plasmids and trans-
posons (Shahada et al., 2006). Class 1 integrons are the
most frequently detected integron class in Salmonella
and other Gram-negative organisms (Guerra et al.,
2000; White, McIver and Rawlinson, 2001).

The most common serotype of turkey Salmonella iso-
lated in the United States in 2010 was S. Hadar 19.9%
(30/151), followed by S. Saintpaul 13.9% (21/151),
S. Heidelberg 9.3% (14/151), S. Schwarzengrund 7.3%
(11/151), and S. III 18: z4, z23 7.3% (11/151) (USDA,
2012). In addition, S. Hadar and S. Heidelberg iso-
lates from slaughterhouses in the United States were
resistant to multiple antimicrobials, with higher levels
of resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin,
tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole, and other antimicro-
bials (Logue et al., 2003; Nayak et al., 2004; Fakhr et al.,
2006; FDA, 2013). In Canada, the most common serovar
found in turkey was S. Heidelberg followed by S. Hadar,
with multidrug resistance to β-lactams and tetracy-
clines, including ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid,
ceftiofur, cefoxitin, and tetracycline; the relevant re-
sistance genes include blaCMY-2, blaTEM, and tet (A)
(Aslam et al., 2012).

In Taiwan, turkey rearing is not a major poultry
industry, and hatching eggs of turkeys are all
im-
ported from the United States, with annual production
of turkeys between 300,000 and 400,000 birds (COA,
2015). There is a paucity of data concerning the an-
timicrobial susceptibility status of Salmonella isolated
from conventional turkey production. Thus, the present
study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of
Salmonella, the serotypes involved, and the antimicro-
bial susceptibility patterns of Salmonella isolates at dif-
ferent stages from conventional turkey farms in Taiwan.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Samples Collection

In this study, a total of 2,040 samples from 3 stages of
turkey rearing was collected at 20 different farms from
March 2014 to February 2016. The 3 stages are 12-day-
old turkey poults, growing periods (10 wk), and finish-
ing periods (20 wk). From each turkey-rearing farm, the
intestines of 8 turkey poults at the age of 12 d, fresh fe-
cal samples from 42 growing period turkeys, and 52 fin-
isher turkeys were collected. All collected samples were
stored on ice and transported to the laboratory within
less than 2 h of collection for immediate processing.

enrichment method in which 25 grams of intestine of
poults or turkey fecal sample were taken and mixed
with 225 mL of buffered peptone water (BPW; Difco,
Detroit, Michigan, USA) at 37◦C for 18 ± 2 hours.
After overnight incubation, 0.1 mL of the incubated
pre-enrichment was transferred to 10 mL of Rappaport-
Vassilliadis (RV; Difco, USA) enrichment broth and in-
cubated at 42◦C for 24 hours. After incubation, one loop
of each selective enrichment broth was streaked onto
xylose-lysine-deoxycholate agar (XLD; Oxoid, Bas-
ingstoke, Hampshire, UK) at 37◦C for 24 hours. Sus-
pected colonies were confirmed through the molecular
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method described
below. A single colony of each bacterial isolate was sus-
pended in 50 μL of 25 mM NaOH and boiled for 20 min-
utes. After adding 4 μL of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), the
suspension was centrifuged, and the supernatant was
used as template DNA. The primers were designed to
amplify a 244 bp DNA fragment (Chiu and Ou, 1996).
The PCR mix was prepared with 3 μL of DNA and
25 μL of 0.4 μM each primer and 5X Fast-RunTM Taq
Master Mix (Protech, Taipei, Taiwan). Amplification
was performed with the PCR cycling conditions (Chiu
and Ou, 1996). The PCR products were then sepa-
rated using conventional electrophoresis in a 2% agarose
gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and ethidium bromide
staining.

Pulsed-ﬁeld Gel Electrophoresis
Genotyping

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was per-
formed according to the protocol developed by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Swami-
nathan et al., 2001). Restriction digestion was carried
out by incubating agarose plug slices with XbaI enzyme
(Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). PFGE was con-
ducted using a CHEF-Mapper (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, California, USA) for 18 hours at 6 V/cm
at 14◦C with an initial switch time of 2.16 seconds
and final switch time of 63.8 seconds. S. Braenderup
H9812 was used as the size standard. The gels were
stained with ethidium bromide (Promega, USA) and
photographed. The DNA restriction patterns and clus-
ter analysis were performed using GelCompar II V.3.5
(Applied Math, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium) and the
unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic aver-
ages (UPGMA). The Dice correlation coefficient was
used with a tolerance of 1% to identify similarities be-
tween band patterns.

Bacterial Isolation and Identiﬁcation

Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 14,028 was used
as the quality control strain. The isolation method
was done according to ISO method 6579/2002/Amd
1:2007 (ISO, 2007). This method was based on the pre-

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing

Bacterial susceptibility to antimicrobials was tested
quantitatively by broth micro-dilution with cation-
adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth (Difco, USA) according
to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Stan-
dards Institute (CLSI, 2007). Sixteen antimicrobials

1The 3 stages are 12-day-old turkey poults, growing periods (10 wk), and finishing periods (20 wk). From each turkey-rearing farm, the intestines

of 8 turkey poults at the age of 12 d and fresh fecal samples from 42 growing-period turkeys and 52 finisher turkeys were collected.

2The isolation method was done according to ISO method 6579/2002/Amd 1:2007.
3 The isolation rates of Salmonella in the collected samples were as follows: 32.5% (52/160) for intestine from 12-day-old turkey poults, 14.2%

(119/840) for feces from grower turkeys, and 6.9% (72/1040) for feces from finisher turkeys.

(7 classes) were used: β-lactams, phenicols, tetracy-
clines, quinolones, aminoglycosides, polymyxins, and
antifolates (Table 1). The criterion of choice was based
on antimicrobials for veterinary and human use as di-
rected by the World Health Organization (WHO), and
the criteria for defining multidrug resistance (MDR),
extensive drug resistance (XDR), and pan-drug resis-
tance (PDR) in Enterobacteriaceae were according to
Magiorakos et al. (2012). The minimum inhibitory con-
centrations (MIC) were determined after 18 h of incu-
bation at 37◦C. Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922, Staphy-
lococcus aureus ATCC 29,213, and Enterococcus faecalis
ATCC 29,212 were used as antimicrobial susceptibility
testing controls in accordance with the CLSI recom-
mendations. The resistance cut-offs that were used were
those defined by the CLSI (2008).

Detection of Resistance Determinants

floR,

tet(A),

The extracted DNA of Salmonella isolates was fur-
ther examined for detection of resistance genes. PCR
was used to determine the presence of select an-
timicrobial resistance genes, including blaTEM, blaSHV,
blaCTX-M, blaPSE, ampC, cmlA,
tet(B)
tet(C),
tet(D), and tet(M) (Mendez et al., 1980;
Marshall et al., 1983; Warsa et al., 1996; Koeck et al.,
1997; Sandvang et al., 1997; Ng et al., 1999; P´erez-
P´erez et al., 2002; Cabrera et al., 2004; Weill et al.,
2004). All isolates were screened for the presence of
class 1 and 2 integrons by PCR and sequenced to iden-
tify gene cassettes. Primers described by L´evesque et
al. (1995) and White, McIver and Rawlinson (2001)
were used to amplify the variable region of class 1
and 2 integrons, respectively. PCR amplifications were
prepared by combining 3 μL of boiled DNA tem-
plate, with 0.2 μM of each primer, 200 μM dNTP
(Protech, Taiwan), 10X reaction buffer (Protech, Tai-
wan), 1 Unit Pro Taq Plus DNA Polymerase (Pro-
tech, Taiwan), and sterile water. Amplification was
performed with PCR conditions described previously
(L´evesque et al., 1995; White, McIver and Rawlin-
son, 2001). PCR results were analyzed on 2% agarose
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Amplified PCR products

were purified with a QIAquick PCR purification Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and sequenced using ABI
3730xl capillary sequencers (Applied Biosystems, Fos-
ter City, CA). The DNA sequences were compared using
the BLAST online search engine from GenBank at the
National Center for Biotechnology Information website
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast).

Statistical Analysis

Each experiment was repeated 3 times. The MIC re-
sults of the strains were converted to the base 2 loga-
rithm (log2), and one-way ANOVA followed by Dun-
can’s multiple rang tests analysis were then used to
compare whether there were differences between the re-
sults of different strains. The chi-square test was used
to compare the antimicrobial resistance genes and the
serotypes. A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. All of the analyses were performed using
the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)
V.15.0.

RESULTS

Bacterial Isolation, Identiﬁcation, and
Serovars

From March 2014 to January 2016, turkeys were sam-
pled from 20 turkey farms in Taiwan. The isolation rates
of Salmonella in the collected samples were as follows:
32.5% (52/160) for intestines from 12-day-old turkey
poults, 14.2% (119/840) for feces from grower turkeys,
and 6.9% (72/1040) for feces from finisher turkeys
(Table 1).

Nine different serotypes of Salmonella spp. were de-
tected in this study (Table 1). Of the 243 strains,
52 Salmonella strains were isolated from intestines
of turkey poults, and their serotypes were S. Hadar
(n = 21), S. Typhimurium (n = 13), S. Livingstone
var. 14 + (n = 10), S. Albany (n = 7), and S.
Tennessee (n = 1). In the flocks of grower turkeys,
119 strains of Salmonella were isolated, and their
serotypes were S. Albany (n = 39), S. Schwarzengrund

4

YEH ET AL.

(n = 37), S. Typhimurium (n = 21), S. Hadar (n
= 18), S. Weltevreden (n = 2), S. Livingstone var.
14 + (n = 1), and S. Newport (n = 1). The com-
mon serotypes of the 72 Salmonella strains isolated
from the finishing periods were S. Albany (n =
39), S. Schwarzengrund (n = 19), and S. Hadar
(n = 8); other serotypes are shown in Table 1.
Interestingly, only 3 serotypes (S. Hadar, S. Ty-
phimurium, and S. Albany) were isolated in whole peri-
ods. The predominant serotype identified in poults was
S. Hadar (40.3%), but S. Albany (32.8 and 54.2%) and
S. Schwarzengrund (31.1 and 26.4%) were the first 2
predominant serotypes in growing and finisher turkeys.
S. Tennessee, S. Weltevreden, and S. Stanely were found
only in poults, growing, and finisher, respectively.

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing

Seven different classes of antimicrobial agents with
a total of 16 antimicrobial agents were tested in this
study (Table 2). The percentages of resistance, MIC50,
and MIC90 of the antimicrobial agents observed among
isolates in different stages at the turkey farms are shown
in Table 2. In these Salmonella isolates, high ratios
of antimicrobial resistance were detected against flor-
fenicol (97.5%), oxytetracycline (89.3%), doxycycline
(78.6%), colistin (77.8%), ampicillin (75.7%), amoxi-
cillin (75.3%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (73.7%),
chloramphenicol (69.1%), and nalidixic acid (67.9%).
Medium-levels of resistance to streptomycin (53.1%),
flumequine (49.0%), cefazolin (37.4%), amoxicillin-
clavulanate (32.5%), and gentamicin (30.9%) also were
found in this study. The lowest levels of resistance were
enrofloxacin (9.1%) and ciprofloxacin (0.8%).

The MIC levels of Salmonella isolates from grower
turkeys were higher than those from the turkey poults
in all of the tested antimicrobial agents, except for
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (P < 0.05). In addi-
tion, the MIC levels of Salmonella isolates from fin-
isher turkeys were higher than those from the turkey
poults in all of the tested antimicrobial agents, except
for amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefazolin, and streptomycin
(P < 0.05). For the penicillins, resistance to amoxi-
cillin was significantly higher in the isolates from grow-
ers and finishers (81.5 and 80.6%) than in those from
poults, whereas the clavulanate combination of amoxi-
cillin substantially decreased the resistance occurrence
of these pathogens (34.5 and 34.7%) (P < 0.05). In the
quinolones, resistance to nalidixic acid and flumequine
was also higher in growers and finishers (growers: 84.0
and 53.8%; finishers: 77.8 and 63.9%) than in that from
poults (P < 0.01). The florfenicol resistance was higher
than chloramphenicol in all stages (P < 0.05).

In this study, the Salmonella isolates also were cat-
egorized based on serotypes, and their percentages of
antimicrobial resistance are summarized in Table 3 ac-
cordingly. Overall, 96.7% (235/243) of the Salmonella
isolates were resistant to more than 3 antimicrobial
agents, with the common serotypes S. Schwarzengrund
(96.4%; 54/56), S. Typhimurium (62.9%; 22/35), and S.
Albany (75.3%; 64/85) showing resistance to 6 or more
antimicrobials (Table 4). Except for S. Schwarzengrund,
S. Typhimurium, and S. Albany, the other serotypes
in this study were susceptible for enrofloxacin and
ciprofloxacin (Table 3). Aminoglycoside resistance in
S. Schwarzengrund (STR: 94.6% and GEN: 87.5%) and
S. Typhimurium (STR: 91.4% and GEN: 57.1%) were
much higher than the other 2 serotypes [S. Albany

The occurrence of a simultaneous resistance to various
antimicrobial agents for Salmonella spp. was frequent,
illustrating a frequency higher than 80% of resistance to
4 classes of key antimicrobial agnets tested, particularly
to S. Schwarzengrund, S. Typhimurium, S. Stanely, S.
Newport, and S. Weltevreden (Table 4). However, 2
isolates (S. Livingstone var. 14+ and S. Hadar) were
susceptible for all antimicrobial agents tested in this

study. In addition, the resistance levels found between
S. Hadar and other Salmonella serotypes (S. Schwaren-
grund, S. Typhimurium, and S. Albany) were signifi-
cantly different, as calculated by one-way ANOVA.

Prevalence of Antimicrobial Resistance
Genes

Detected β-lactam resistance genes included blaPSE-1
(140/243), blaTEM (102/243), blaCTX-M (83/243), and
ampC (35/243), but other genes including blaSHV,

YEH ET AL.

ampCMOXM, ampCDHAM, and ampCACCM were not
detected in this study (Table 5). ampCEBCM and
ampCFOXM were detected in S. Typhimurium only.
Chloramphenicol resistance genes detected in this study
were floR (155/243) and cmlA (83/243) (Table 5). In-
terestingly, floR was not detected in all S. Hadar, and
only one isolate was cmlA positive. Frequently detected
tetracycline resistance genes included tet(A) (147/243),
tet(D) (71/243), tet(B) (10/243), tet(M) (17/243), and
tet(C)(6/243) (Table 5). In addition, there is a corre-
lation calculated by the chi-square test between tet(A)
and tet(D) in all serotypes, except for S. Tennessee, S.
Hadar, and S. Newport. Only one antimicrobial resis-
tance gene (cmlA) was detected in S. Tennessee. There
is no correlation between antimicrobial resistance genes
and serotypes (S. Schwarzengrund, S. Typhimurium, S.
Albany, and S. Hadar) based on the analysis using the
chi-square test. The int1 gene, encoding the integrase of
class 1 integrons, was identified in 176 isolates (72.4%)
in which the conserved region 3’ of this type of integron
also was amplified. All isolates were negative for the
int2 gene. Table 5 shows various resistance genes found
in each of the serovars isolated from turkey farms.

Classiﬁcation of Class 1 Integron

Class 1 integrons were detected in 174 (72.4%) iso-
lates, of which more than half were found in the
following serotypes: S. Newport (3/3), S. Stanley (3/3),
S. Tennessee (1/1), S. Schwarzengrund (54/56), S. Al-
bany (79/85), and S. Typhimurium (23/35). Class 2
integrons were not detected in any of the isolates.
The drfA1-orfC/blaPSE-1 gene cassettes arrangement
was found in 83 integron-positive Salmonella isolates
(47.7%), followed by drfA12-orfF-aadA2 gene cassettes
with the percentage at 38.50% (67/174). The blaPSE-1
gene cassette was 6.90% (12/174), and the aadA22 gene
cassette was 4.60% (8/174). The results of serotypes
and their percentages of integrons are summarized in
Table 5. From these results, the percentage of inte-
grons in S. Hadar was much lower than in the other
serotypes (8/47, 17.0%), and all integrons in S. Hadar
were blaPSE-1 gene cassette positive. Most of the drfA1-
orfC/blaPSE-1 gene cassettes and drfA12-orfF-aadA2
gene cassettes were found in integrons of S. Albany
and S. Schwarzengrund, respectively. The serotypes
with multidrug resistance, such as S. Newport (3/3),
S. Stanley (3/3), S. Schwarzengrund (54/56), and S.
Albany (79/85), were mostly found to harbor the class
1 integrons.

DISCUSSION

The current outbreak of human Salmonella infec-
tion associated with turkey meat has highlighted risks
associated with the production, handling, and prepa-
ration of meat and poultry products (CDC, 2011).
Furthermore, multidrug-resistant Salmonella spp. has

ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE OF SALMONELLA FROM TURKEY

7

been frequently detected in humans and animals
worldwide (Winokur et al., 2000; Lu et al., 2014; Routh
et al., 2015; Sinwat et al., 2016), with many countries
already utilizing monitoring programs for antimicro-
bial resistance in Salmonella. Hence, many research re-
ports on this topic are available (USDA, 2000; White
et al., 2001; EFSA, 2008). For example, several stud-
ies on Salmonella in the United Kingdom were con-
ducted at 252 turkey farms (Featherstone et al., 2010),
with results showing that the isolation rate at the farm
level was 34.1% (86/252) and that the most preva-
lent serovar were S. Kottbus (17.9%), followed by S.
Typhimurium (6.0%) and S. Derby (5.2%; 13/252).
Another report from a British turkey breeder farm and
hatchery demonstrated that S. Kottbus and S. Sen-
ftenberg were the most frequently isolated (Mueller-
Doblies et al., 2013). Aury et al. (2010) conducted
an investigation into turkey Salmonella in France, and
the results showed that the 5 most common serotypes
were S. Derby (29.2%), S. Enteritidis (11.7%), S.
Typhimurium (10.1%), S. Hadar (8.4%), and S. Mban-
daka (6.8%) (Aury et al., 2010). In Canada, S. Heidel-
berg and S. Hadar were the most prevalent serotypes
in turkeys (Aslam et al., 2012). A report indicated that
the most commonly detected serotypes among turkey
isolates in the United States were S. Hadar (19.9%), S.
Saintpaul (13.9%), S. Heidelberg (9.3%), S. Schwarzen-
grund (7.3%), and S. Albany (4.0%) (USDA, 2012). In
the present study, the most common serotypes of the
Salmonella in turkeys were S. Albany (35.0%; 85/243),
S. Schwarzengrund (23.0%; 56/243), S. Harda (19.3%;
47/243), and S. Typhimurium (14.4%; 35/243). It can
be noted that S. Hadar was among the most com-
mon serotypes in Taiwan, France, Canada, and the
United States, but not in the United Kingdom. S.
Typhimurium also was frequently isolated in Taiwan,
the United Kingdom, and France. The abovementioned
results from different countries indicate that geograph-
ical factors may have contributed to the varying distri-
bution of prevalence of Salmonella serotypes (Lewerin
et al., 2011). Thus, each country or geographic region
will need to conduct epidemiological surveillance of the
Salmonella serotypes in a proactive manner.

Vertical transmission of Salmonella has been demon-
strated experimentally in chickens (Keller et al., 1995).
Horizontal transmission in hatcheries has been sug-
gested in some studies as well (Angen et al., 1996;
Christensen et al., 1997; Skov et al., 1999). In Taiwan,
it is mandatory by law to quarantine imported young
turkeys and imported embryonated turkey eggs for 10
d after being imported (BAPHIQ, 2009). Therefore,
whether there is vertical transmission or horizontal
transmission during the quarantine period merits fur-
ther studies when the laws and regulations permit.

Salmonella isolated from turkey meat products in the
United States was found to be highly resistant to an-
timicrobials such as ampicillin, tetracycline, and strep-
tomycin (FDA, 2013). In the present study, the results
showed that over half of Salmonella isolates were resis-

tant to streptomycin (53.1%), nalidixic acid (67.9%),
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
(73.7%), amoxicillin
(75.3%), ampicillin (75.7%), colistin (77.8%), doxycy-
cline (78.6%), oxytetracycline (89.3%), and florfenicol
(97.5%) (Table 2), all of which are frequently admin-
istered on turkey farms in Taiwan. The results also
indicated a similar pattern in high resistance to antimi-
crobials such as streptomycin, ampicillin, and oxyte-
tracycline in Taiwan. It also can be noted that a
high prevalence of ampicillin- and amoxicillin-resistant
strains was observed in almost all of the Salmonella
serotypes in this study, with the exception of S. Hadar
and S. Livingstone var. 14 +. In addition, when com-
paring the MIC levels of the same antimicrobial agent
in the salmonella isolates from finishing turkeys and
those from turkey poults, the MIC levels were found
to be significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the finish-
ing turkeys than those in the turkey poults for almost
all the antimicrobial agents tested in this study, ex-
cept for amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefazolin, and strep-
tomycin (Table 2). This might reflect the effect of
long-term antimicrobial administration in the turkey-
rearing industry in Taiwan. During the period of
turkey-rearing (approximately 4.5 to 5 mo), antimicro-
bial agents used in turkeys are often administered in a
way that increases antimicrobial resistance, e.g., by sub-
therapeutic dosage or repeated mass treatments, long-
term administration of antimicrobials, or addition to
feed and water for prophylactic purposes (Viswanathan,
2014). These practices may have caused the emergence
of resistant Salmonella strains (EFSA and ECDC,
2014). In Taiwan, chloramphenicol has been prohibited
for use in food-producing animals since 2002 (COA,
2002). After chloramphenicol was banned, florfenicol
was used to replace chloramphenicol in clinical treat-
ment (Neu and Fu, 1980; White et al., 2000). Some
studies have shown that the frequent and intensive ad-
ministration of antimicrobials may lead to the spread
of plasmids, transposons, or integrons carrying rele-
vant genes for antimicrobial resistance among differ-
ent strains of bacteria (Bennett, 2008; Nikaido, 2009).
Since the aforementioned materials could also harbor
resistance genes of other classes of antimicrobials, mul-
tiple antimicrobial resistances could then ensue (Levy
and Marshall, 2004; Salyers et al., 2004). This might
explain the ubiquity of antimicrobial resistance found
in different serotypes of Salmonella on Taiwan’s turkey
farms. The above points underline the need to address
these issues, such as the practice of administering an-
timicrobials and the emergence of antimicrobial resis-
tance facing the turkey-rearing industry in Taiwan.

In the present study, 72.4% of the Salmonella iso-
lates (176/243) were found to carry the intI1 gene,
with no intI2 gene detected. Of the 176 isolates
with the intI1 gene, different serotypes showed a
intI1 gene distribution with the
varying degree of
highest proportions in S. Stanley 100% (3/3), S.
Tennessee 100% (1/1), and S. Newport 100% (3/3), fol-
lowed by S.Schwarzengrund 96.4% (54/56), S. Albany

8

YEH ET AL.

92.9% (79/85), S. Typhimurium 65.7% (23/35), S.
Livingstone var. 14 + 45.5% (5/11), and S. Hadar 17.0%
(8/47). According to many literatures, there were 9.1 to
83.6% of Salmonella strains carrying class 1 integrons,
which are genetic materials that confer multidrug re-
sistance (Leverstein-van Hall et al., 2002; Chen et al.,
2004; Dessie et al., 2013; Hsu et al., 2013; Siriken et al.,
2015). Thus, it can be deduced that the int1 gene had a
strong presence in most of the turkey Salmonella in Tai-
wan. In addition, the int1 genes detected in the present
study mostly belonged to the drfA1-orfC/blaPSE-1 gene
cassettes and drfA12-orfF-aadA2 gene cassettes, and
this finding was consistent with the study results by Hsu
et al. (2013). Moreover, detection of the antimicrobial
resistance genes was performed in this study, and the
results showed the top 4 of the most isolated serotypes
(S. Albany, S. Schwarzengrund, S. Hadar, and S.
Typhimurium) all carried multi-antimicrobial resis-
tance genes. A high prevalence of ampicillin- and
amoxicillin-resistant strains was observed in this study.
In terms of the β-lactam resistance genes, blaPSE and
blaCTX-M were detected in the S. Albany isolates at the
percentages of 94.1% (80/85) and 38.8% (33/85), re-
spectively; blaTEM was detected in 87.5% (49/56) of
the S. Schwarzengrund isolates; blaPSE was detected
in 44.7% (21/47) of the S. Hadar isolates; blaCTX-M,
blaTEM, and blaPSE were detected in 85.7% (30/35),
65.7% (23/35), and 65.7% (23/35), respectively, of the
S. Typhimurium isolates. It can be noted that although
44.7% (21/47) of the S. Hadar isolates carried the
gene of blaPSE, antimicrobial resistance to ampicillin
and amoxicillin was found to be relatively low (8.5
and 10.6%, respectively) in the S. Hadar isolates. A
high prevalence of chloramphenicol and florfenicol re-
sistance strains was observed in this study, indicating
that active efflux pumps (cmlA and floR gene) played
an important role in intrinsic and acquired resistance
against chloramphenicol and/or florfenicol (Braibant
et al., 2005; Chang et al., 2015). In this study, floR
gene was detected in 84.7% (72/85) of the S. Albany
isolates, while cmlA and floR genes were detected in
98.2% (55/56) and 89.3% (50/56), respectively, of the
S. Schwarzengrund isolates. Amphenicol-related resis-
tance genes were seldom detected in the S. Hadar iso-
lates in this study, whereas floR gene was detected in
71.4% (25/35) of the S. Typhimurium isolates. Again,
it can be noted that antimicrobial resistance to flor-
fenicol was fairly high (91.5%) in the S. Hadar isolates,
despite only one out of the 47 S. Hadar isolates be-
ing detected with cmlA gene. For tetracycline-related
resistance genes, only a few were detected in the S.
Albany isolates, whereas many were detected in the S.
Schwarzengrund and S. Typhimurium isolates with tet
(A) and tet (D) found to be the main resistance genes.
tet (A) and tet (D) were detected in 94.6% (53/56) and
71.4% (40/56) of the S. Schwarzengrund isolates; tet (A)
and tet (D) were detected in 74.3% (26/35) and 51.4%
(18/35) of the S. Typhimurium isolates. For S. Hadar,
tet (A) was detected in all of the S. Hadar isolates

(47/47). There were some discrepancies between the de-
tection rates of resistance genes and the actual levels of
antimicrobial resistance for some Salmonella serovars in
this study. For instance, 44.7% (21/47) of the S. Hadar
isolates were found to have blaPSE gene, but only 8.5
and 10.7% of the S. Hadar isolates showed resistance to
ampicillin and amoxicillin, respectively. The underlying
reason for this phenomenon needs to be further investi-
gated. In addition, S. Hadar isolates in this study also
had high resistance to florfenicol (91.5%), but surpris-
ingly none (0%) of the S. Hadar isolates was detected to
harbor floR gene, and only one of the S. Hadar isolates
(2.1%) had cmlA gene. Taking account of this result and
the other finding that only 4.3% of the S. Hadar iso-
lates were resistance to chloramphenicol, which belongs
to the same class of antimicrobial agent as florfenicol, it
might suggest that other mechanisms of antimicrobial
resistance could be involved (data not shown), such as
over-expression of the multidrug efflux system: mdfA,
floR, cmlA, or AcrAB-TolC system (Andersen et al.,
2015, Baucheron et al., 2004). This kind of discrepancy
also was observed in the S. Albany isolates, in which
the resistances to doxycyline and oxytetracycline were
65.9 and 87.1%, while the detection rates of tet (A) and
tet (D) genes were only 9.4 and 4.7% each. There might
be other mechanisms involved, and further studies and
tests are needed for elucidation.

Nontyphoidal Salmonella spp. has become increas-
ingly resistant to clinically important antimicrobial
agents, and this is causing a public health concern. This
is the first paper, to the best of our knowledge, that pro-
vides data about the current status of the antimicrobial
susceptibility of nontyphoidal Salmonella isolated from
commercial turkey farms in various regions of Taiwan.
Since Taiwan’s turkey-rearing industry relies heavily on
imported turkey chicks from the United States, further
studies are needed to clarify whether young turkeys are
already infected with Salmonella at hatcheries when be-
ing imported. Approaches based on ecology and the re-
sults of this study underline the need for more proac-
tive surveillance of antimicrobial resistance and the ur-
gency in improvement of poultry production practices
in order to reduce and even eliminate food contamina-
tion by multidrug-resistant bacteria. Moreover, an ap-
proach based on ecology and epidemiology is needed
to fully understand the emergence, transmission, and
persistence of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella.
