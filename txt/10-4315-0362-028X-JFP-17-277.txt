ABSTRACT

The goal of this study was to examine antimicrobial resistance and characterize the implicated genes in 222 isolates of
Escherichia coli from 187 samples of raw milk and the two most popular cheeses in Egypt. E. coli isolates were tested for
susceptibility to 12 antimicrobials by a disk diffusion method. Among the 222 E. coli isolates, 66 (29.7%) were resistant to one or
more antimicrobials, and half of these resistant isolates showed a multidrug resistance phenotype (resistance to at least three
different drug classes). The resistance traits were observed to tetracycline (27.5%), ampicillin (18.9%), streptomycin (18.5%),
sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (11.3%), cefotaxime (4.5%), kanamycin (4.1%), ceftazidime (3.6%), chloramphenicol (2.3%),
nalidixic acid (1.8%), and ciproﬂoxacin (1.4%). No resistance to fosfomycin and imipenem was observed. Tetracycline resistance
genes tetA, tetB, and tetD were detected in 53 isolates, 9 isolates, and 1 isolate, respectively, but tetC was not detected.
Aminoglycoside resistance genes strA, strB, aadA, and aphA1 were detected in 41, 41, 11, and 9 isolates, respectively.
Sulfonamide resistance genes sul1, sul2, and sul3 were detected in 7, 25, and 3 isolates, respectively. Of 42 ampicillin-resistant
isolates, blaTEM, blaCTX-M, and blaSHV were detected in 40, 9, and 3 isolates, respectively, and 10 (23.8%) ampicillin-resistant
isolates were found to produce extended-spectrum b-lactamase. Each bla gene of extended-spectrum b-lactamase–producing E.
coli was further subtyped to be blaCTX-M-15, blaCTX-M-104, blaTEM-1, and blaSHV-12. The class 1 integron was also detected in 28
resistant isolates, and three different patterns were obtained by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Sequencing
analysis of the variable region revealed that four isolates had dfrA12/orfF/aadA2, two had aadA22, and one had dfrA1/aadA1.
These data suggest that antimicrobial-resistant E. coli are widely distributed in the milk production and processing environment in
Egypt and may play a role in dissemination of antimicrobial resistance to other pathogenic and commensal bacteria.

for

Worldwide antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the
most serious problems for both public and animal health,
with inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents in humans
and animals being one of the main causes of this problem (7,
14). Food may act as a vector
the transfer of
antimicrobial-resistant bacteria to humans (53). Contamina-
tion of foods with such bacteria could be a major public
health threat because there is a possibility that genes
encoding AMR determinants could be transferred to other
bacteria of clinical signiﬁcance (48). The rapid dissemina-
tion of the AMR genes among bacteria could be facilitated if
these genes are encoded on mobile genetic elements such as
transposons, and integrons (31, 45). Because
plasmids,
Escherichia coli acquires resistance easily and is a common
inhabitant of the intestinal tract of humans and animals, E.
coli has been selected as a sentinel organism in AMR
surveillance studies (55).

resistant bacteria (50, 51).
Information concerning the
problem of AMR in the whole African continent is limited
(56). Similar
to many other developing and African
countries, food hygiene and safety conditions in Egypt,
speciﬁcally in the dairy sector, require more attention. In
addition, AMR is exacerbated by the lack of stringent
controls on antimicrobial use in human health as well as
animal production systems (2), which increases the risk of
emergence of foodborne microbes possessing an array of
resistance genes. Egypt,
times, has been
considered to be one of
the leading countries in the
manufacture of dairy products. Dairy products, especially
cheese, play an important role in the Egyptian diet (8, 18,
23). Many people eat a certain amount of cheese at least
once every day (47). However, very little is known about the
prevalence of AMR and its molecular basis in bacteria
isolated from Egyptian food.

susceptibility and genetic mechanisms of AMR.

isolates were classiﬁed as susceptible, intermediate, and resistant
according to the zone diameter interpretative standards recom-
mendations by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (13).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

E. coli isolates. Two hundred twenty-two E. coli isolated and
identiﬁed in our previous study (35) were used in this study. One
hundred eleven isolates were from raw milk, and 89 and 22 isolates
were isolated from Karish and Ras cheeses, respectively.

Antimicrobial susceptibility test. Antimicrobial susceptibil-
ity testing was carried out for each of the 222 E. coli isolates.
Twelve different antimicrobials were tested by the disk diffusion
method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute guidelines (12). E. coli strain ATCC 25922 was used as
a quality control. The following antimicrobials (BD, Franklin
Lakes, NJ) were used: ampicillin (AMP; 10 lg), cefotaxime (CTX;
30 lg), ceftazidime (CAZ; 30 lg), cefotaxime–clavulanic acid
(CTX-CLA; 30 lg/10 lg), ceftazidime–clavulanic acid (CAZ-
CLA; 30 lg/10 lg), imipenem (IPM; 30 lg), kanamycin (KAN; 30
lg), streptomycin (STR; 10 lg),
tetracycline (TET; 30 lg),
ciproﬂoxacin (CIP; 5 lg), nalidixic acid (NAL; 30 lg),
sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SXT; 1.25 lg/23.75 lg), chlor-
amphenicol (CHL; 30 lg), and fosfomycin (FOS; 50 lg). The

ESBL detection. Ampicillin-resistant E. coli were examined
for extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) production by the
combination disk diffusion test using CTX or CAZ with or without
CLA according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
criteria (12).

resistance to one or more of

Detection of AMR genes. Sixty-six E. coli

isolates that
exhibited phenotype of
the
antimicrobial agents tested, were examined for AMR genes
respective to each phenotype. The presence of genes associated
with tetracycline resistance (tetA, tetB, tetC, and tetD), b-lactam
resistance (blaCTX-M, blaSHV, and blaTEM), aminoglycoside
resistance (strA, strB, aadA [encoding streptomycin resistance]
and aphA1 [encoding kanamycin resistance]), and sulfonamide
resistance (sul1, sul2, and sul3) were detected by PCR as described
previously (10, 28, 34, 48). Primer sequences and predicted sizes
of PCR products of different AMR genes are listed in Table 1. The
PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose
gels (Seakem LE Agarose, Lonza, Basel, Switzerland), stained
with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light by using a
gel documentation system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).

DNA sequencing of blaCTX-M, blaSHV, and blaTEM genes.
blaCTX-M, blaSHV, and blaTEM genes were PCR ampliﬁed from
ampicillin-resistant isolates, and their products were sequenced to
determine their subtypes as described previously (32, 34). In brief,
the ampliﬁed products were puriﬁed using a Wizard SV Gel and
PCR Clean-Up system (Promega, Fitchburg, WI) and sequenced
on both DNA strands by using primers as described previously (32,
34) and the BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA). The products were
then puriﬁed using a CleanSEQ kit (Beckman Coulter, Beverly,
MA) and subjected to sequencing in an ABI PRISM 3130-Avant
Genetic analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). The DNA sequence
data were compared with those in the GenBank database
(Nucleotide collection database [nr/nt]) by using the BLAST
algorithm available at
the National Center for Biotechnology
Information Web site (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Multiple DNA
alignments were performed by using ClustalW of the MegAlign
program (DNASTAR software package, Lasergene, Madison, WI).

Detection and sequencing of class 1 integron. Detection of
the class 1 integron gene intI1 was done as described previously
(28). In brief, the presence of the intI1 gene (encoding class 1
integrase) was examined by PCR using a primer set of INT-1U and
INT-1D (Table 1). The variable region of the class 1 integron was
ampliﬁed using 50-CS and 30-CS primers (Table 1), and PCR
products were puriﬁed and sequenced as described below. The
presence of qacED1-sul1 genes in the 30 conserved region of the
class 1 integron was also examined in all intI1-positive isolates as
described by Sa´enz et al. (40).

Typing and sequencing of the variable region of class 1
integron genes. The PCR product for the variable region of the
class 1 integron was gel-cut puriﬁed with a Wizard SV Gel and
PCR Clean-Up system (Promega). The puriﬁed PCR products were
subjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) by
digesting with HinfI enzyme (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) as
described previously (36). The digest showing the same restriction

RESULTS

Antimicrobial resistance phenotypes of E. coli
isolates. Two hundred twenty-two E. coli
isolates from
raw milk, Karish cheese, and Ras cheese were tested for
antimicrobial susceptibility to 12 antimicrobial agents. As
shown in Table 2, 61, 42, 41, 25, 10, 9, 8, 5, 4, and 3 isolates
of E. coli were resistant to TET (27.5%), AMP (18.9%),
STR (18.5%), SXT (11.3%), CTX (4.5%), KAN (4.1%),
CAZ (3.6%), CHL (2.3%), NAL (1.8%), and CIP (1.4%),
respectively. None of them were resistant to FOS and IPM.
Production of ESBLs was detected in 10 (23.8%) of 42
AMP-resistant E. coli. The phenotypic resistance patterns of
the E. coli are shown in Table 3. Among the 222 E. coli
isolates, 66 (29.7%) were resistant
to one or more
antimicrobials; 33 (50%) of
these 66 isolates showed
multidrug resistance, i.e., they showed resistance to at least
three different classes of antimicrobial agents.

coli, tetA, tetB, and tetD genes were detected in 53 isolates, 9
isolates, and 1 isolate, respectively. Both tetA and tetB or
tetA and tetD genes were detected in one isolate each (Table

tested.

Among b-lactam resistance genes in 42 ampicillin-
resistant E. coli, blaTEM, blaCTX-M, and blaSHV were
detected in 40, 9, and 3 isolates, respectively (Table 4).
Among 42 ampicillin-resistant E. coli, 10 were ESBL
producers, and blaCTX-M, blaTEM, and blaSHV genes were
detected in 9, 8, and 1 ESBL-producing E. coli, respectively
(Supplemental Table S). Among them, ﬁve ESBL-producing
E. coli carried both blaCTX-M and blaTEM genes and two
carried blaCTX-M, blaTEM, and blaSHV genes (Supplemental
Table S). Sequence analysis of blaCTX-M, blaTEM, and
blaSHV genes in ESBL-producing E. coli (n ¼ 10) revealed
that blaCTX-M was typed to be blaCTX-M-15 (eight isolates)
and blaCTX-M-104 (one isolate) and that the blaTEM type was
blaTEM-1. In contrast, blaSHV was typed to be blaSHV-12.
blaCTX-M-15 alone was present in one isolate, and the same
for blaCTX-M-104, whereas blaCTX-M-15 together with blaTEM-1
was present in ﬁve isolates and blaCTX-M-15 together with
blaTEM-1 and blaSHV-12 was present in two isolates.

The strA, strB, and aadA genes encoding streptomycin
resistance were detected in 41, 41, and 11 of 41
streptomycin-resistant isolates, respectively (Table 4). The
aphA1 gene encoding kanamycin resistance was detected in
all kanamycin-resistant E. coli (Table 4). Different combi-
nations of sulfonamide resistance genes such as sul1, sul2,
and sul3 were detected in 25 sulfamethoxazole-trimetho-
prim–resistant E. coli (Table 5). All isolates harbored the
sul2 gene; seven (28%) harbored the sul1 gene, in addition
to sul2; and three (12%) harbored sul3 with the sul2 gene
(Tables 4 and 5).

Prevalence and sequencing of integron genes. The
class 1 integron was detected in 28 (42.4%) of the 66
resistant isolates. Ampliﬁcation of the variable region of the
class 1 integron resulted in three size fragments—1, 1.5, and
2 kb—by PCR in 7 of the 28 intI1-positive isolates in which
the qacED1-sul1 genes were also ampliﬁed (data not

two of the 1-kb fragments gave the same RFLP patterns,
indicating that each fragment in four and two strains was
identical,
respectively. Furthermore, sequencing analysis
revealed that 2-, 1.5-, and 1-kb fragments contained dfrA12/
orfF/aadA2, dfrA1/aadA1, and aadA22, respectively.

DISCUSSION

There have been very few published studies on the
occurrence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in food samples in
Egypt (2, 20, 21). In addition, the molecular characteristics
of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from food samples in Egypt
are almost unknown. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the ﬁrst report regarding the comprehensive analysis of
AMR and AMR genes in E. coli isolated from raw milk and
raw milk cheese in Egypt.

This study shows that AMR is widespread in E. coli in
such products. The most prevalent resistance traits were
tetracycline (27.5%)
followed by ampicillin (18.9%),
aminoglycosides (streptomycin, kanamycin) (18.5%), and
sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (11.3%) (Table 2). These
ﬁndings are in agreement with many studies from different
countries that found that resistance to tetracycline, penicil-
lins, aminoglycosides, and sulfonamides is generally the
most prevalent among E. coli isolated from food products or
healthy food-producing animals (15, 24, 33, 38, 39, 41, 44,
48, 52). Different use patterns of antimicrobial agents are
expected to have some impact on the distribution of AMR

phenotypes and possible resistance determinants (1, 29). Our
data on the distribution of resistance phenotypes support this
hypothesis, as higher levels of resistance were observed to
the common antimicrobials that have been widely used in
Egypt. In most of the developing countries, including Egypt,
the low cost and easy availability of these antibiotics are the
main reasons behind their wide use to treat diseases,
particularly diarrhea (49). In contrast, in this study, 2.3%
of E. coli showed resistance to chloramphenicol. Chloram-
phenicol has been banned and has not been approved for use
in food-producing animals in many countries, but resistance
to chloramphenicol still remains in Egypt.

Multidrug resistance bacteria can come into contact
with humans through the food supply (e.g., meat, ﬁsh, dairy
products, and eggs) and direct contact with animals or
indirectly through environmental pathways (4).
In the
present study, 50% of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli isolates
showed resistance to more than three classes of antimicro-
bials (Table 3). Moreover, all phenotypically resistant
isolates (n ¼ 66) carried at
least one AMR gene, and
74.2% of these isolates carried multiple (two or more) AMR
genes (Table 5). Among tetracycline resistance genes, tetA
was detected in the highest frequency (86.9%), a ﬁnding that
is in agreement with several previous studies (9, 19, 37, 51).
The tetB and tetD genes were also detected in our study, but
in a lower frequency than those reported previously (38). In
this study, tetC was not detected in any isolates, although
Srinivasan et al. (44) reported a high frequency of tetC in E.
coli isolates from dairy cows with mastitis. The difference
could be owing to the different sources of E. coli between
these two studies.

In agreement with the previous ﬁndings (11, 19, 21, 24,
40, 48) that TEM b-lactamase was the most prevalent in
ampicillin-resistant E. coli
isolates from food and food-
producing animals, all ampicillin-resistant E. coli (n ¼ 42)
carried the blaTEM gene, except for two isolates (Supple-
mental Table S). ESBL-producing E. coli have become a
serious problem worldwide and blaCTX-M has been distrib-
uted worldwide (42). However, little is known about ESBL-
producing bacteria and the types of b-lactamases occurring
in Egypt. In this study, 10 ESBL-producing E. coli were
isolated from raw milk and Karish and Ras cheeses. Among
them, nine blaCTX-M, eight blaTEM, and three blaSHV genes
were detected. Furthermore, each b-lactamase gene was
subtyped to be blaCTX-M-15, blaCTX-M-104, blaTEM-1, and
blaSHV-12. blaCTXM-15, blaTEM-1, and blaSHV-12 genes have
been previously reported in clinical E. coli isolates in Egypt
(3, 17). The blaCTX-M-104 gene is a novel variant of blaCTX-M;
it differs from blaCTX-M-14 by a point mutation that leads to a
change of only one amino acid (N275S). This new
blaCTX-M-14–like gene was reported for the ﬁrst time in an
E. coli isolate from chicken in China (57), and more recently
in an E. coli isolate from swine, also in China (30). Among
10 ESBL-producing E. coli, three isolates were positive for
either blaCTX-M-15, blaCTX-M-104, or blaTEM-1, and ﬁve
isolates were positive for both blaCTX-M-15 and blaTEM-1,
whereas two were positive for blaCTX-M-15, blaTEM-1, and
blaSHV-12. E. coli isolates harboring b-lactamase genes such
as blaCTX-M-15, blaTEM-1, and blaSHV-12 have been previ-
ously reported from hospital waste water in India (16); to our

report of E. coli

All the 41 streptomycin-resistant isolates carried both
strA and strB genes. Eleven of them carried strA/B along
with aadA. The strA and strB genes were always present
together in our isolates. This ﬁnding is in agreement with the
results of other reports (29, 38, 44, 46). In this study, the
sul2 gene was detected in all sulfamethoxazole-trimetho-
prim–resistant E. coli followed by sul1 (28%) and sul3
(12%) (Table 4). This tendency is in agreement with the data
previously reported in E. coli isolates from food or animals
(19, 22, 24, 40, 45).

indicating that

Integrons play a major role in the storage and spread of
AMR among gram-negative bacteria (43). Class 1 integrons
were detected in 42.4% of the resistant isolates (n ¼ 66)
investigated in this study. All of them were phenotypically
resistant to four different classes of antimicrobials, with the
exception of one isolate that showed resistance to two
classes only,
the multidrug resistance
observed in these isolates may be associated with the class
1 integron. Furthermore, we observed that 24 of 28 intI1-
positive isolates were sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim resis-
tant. However, when we analyzed the remaining four
isolates for the presence of sulfonamide resistance genes,
sul2 was detected in these four isolates and three of them
also carried sul3, indicating that the class 1 integron is often
associated with sul genes, as was reported previously (6).

The trimethoprim resistance genes (dfrA1 and dfrA12)
and aminoglycoside resistance genes (aadA1, aadA2, and
aadA22) detected in this study were also previously reported
in human E. coli isolates and food isolates (19, 21, 24, 25,
40). Interestingly, the rare aminoglycoside resistance gene
aadA22, which was reported for the ﬁrst time in an E. coli
isolated from Egyptian Domiati cheese (21), was detected in
two isolates from raw milk in this study. Twenty-one intI1-
positive E. coli lacked the qacED1-sul1 region in the 30-
conserved region of the class 1 integron. The existence of
these defective integrons has been reported (5, 26, 54), and
our
laboratory is currently determining the complete
structure and characterizing these integrons more precisely.
Some of the multidrug-resistant strains isolated in this
study were also found to be harboring virulence genes
(Supplemental Table S). The presence of E. coli strains
carrying resistance and virulence genes is worrisome as this
could enhance the emergence of pathogens that might be
difﬁcult to treat with antibiotics (10).

results of

In conclusion,

this study highlight

the
importance of E. coli present in dairy products in Egypt as
a reservoir for AMR E. coli and suggest that AMR genes
carrying E. coli are widely distributed in the milk production
and processing environment in Egypt. These AMR E. coli
may play a role in dissemination of these genes to other
pathogenic and commensal bacteria. The presence of
multidrug-resistant strains is alarming, because such strains
are considered a serious threat
to public health. This
potential threat emphasizes the need for effective hygienic
and sanitation procedures in milk and cheese production and
the wise use of antimicrobial agents in food-producing
