Escherichia coli is a natural colonizer of the urogenital mucosa of healthy females; however it is one of the
pathogens associated to reproductive failures in cows and sows. A better knowledge about the characteristics of
native E. coli will allow us to diﬀerentiate them from pathogenic strains. Ninety autochthonous isolates from the
reproductive tract of sows and cows were characterized to determine the phylogenetic proﬁle, antibiotic re-
sistance and virulence factors; also, comparisons between diﬀerent breeding systems were performed. Vaginal
colonization of E. coli was statistically higher in cows (57.5%) than sows (23.8%), and most isolates belonged to
the phylogenetic group A: 79.69 and 80.77%, respectively; moreover phylo-groups B1 (12.5 and 11.54%) and D
(7.81 and 7.69%) were signiﬁcantly lower; however, none was classiﬁed as B2. Positive associations between
virulence factors and group D were found. Isolates with antimicrobial susceptibility were associated with group
A and the MDR (Multiple Drug Resistance) was related to the porcine source. These results contribute to the
knowledge of extra-intestinal E. coli populations; which could aﬀect the reproductive performance of females.

1. Introduction

Escherichia coli has been associated with a wide range of diseases in
farm animals that cause high economic losses due to mortality, mor-
bidity and treatment costs, and also increase the risk of inducing an
impairment in food quality and therefore in human health [1,2]. A
special impact in the productivity is produced by extra-intestinal in-
fections caused by E. coli, such as metritis in cattle [3], uterine and
urinary tract infections in pigs [4,5]; these infections represent im-
portant causes of infertility in females in livestock [5,6]. However, E.
coli was also described in the autochthonous bacterial communities of
vagina from healthy cows [7]. Moreover, Otero et al., showed that E.
coli is part of the vaginal microbiota in heifers from weaning to
breeding [8]. Bara et al. [9] studied the microbial colonization of cervix
and vagina of sows and found E. coli before mating and at piglet
weaning.

The phylogenetic characterization into A, B1, B2 and D groups has
been reported for several E. coli communities from animal hosts
[4,10,11]. Johnson and Stell [12] observed that the extra-intestinal

pathogenic strains from human were associated to phylogenetic group
B2 and to a lesser extent to D, while commensals belonged to A. This
phylogenetic characterization was also applied for evaluate extra-
intestinal E.coli from animal source, and it was showed that A and B1
were associated with porcine pyelonephritis [4]. These two phy-
logroups together with D, were described in the bovine uterine colo-
nization in normal puerperium as well in clinical metritis [13]. How-
ever, to our knowledge, there are no reports about the phylogenetic
characterization of native E. coli populations from the urogenital tract
of healthy cows and sows. More accurate descriptions of these microbial
communities and their intrinsic virulence potential will allow a better
understanding of their possible role in extraintestinal infections, as
Johnson and Russo [14] suggested. Virulence proﬁles may be linked to
phylogenetic groups as well as to antimicrobial resistance traits
[15,16]. The resistance developed by E. coli, particularly extended-
spectrum β-lactamase producers, is one of the main reasons for low cure
rates for infections in livestock [17]. Moreover, both commensal and
pathogenic E. coli in farming systems were recognised as reservoirs that
can acquire and play a pivotal role in the transfer of antibiotic

resistance [2,18,19]. Antimicrobials are administrated therapeutically,
metaphylactically and prophylactically and also as growth promoters,
strategies which are still applied in Argentina. Considering that E. coli
belongs to the native microbiota of the vagina and urogenital tract of
cows and sows respectively, and that some strains may be potential
pathogens for the dam and its oﬀspring, the aim of this study was to
characterize native E. coli from these tracts in order to establish the
phylogenetic structure, antibiotic resistance prevalence and the in-
trinsic virulence potential of these populations in healthy females.

phylogenetic groups following the criteria proposed by Clermont et al.
[22] based on three genetic markers: chuA, yjaA and TspE4.C2
(Table 1).

The occurrence of virulence genes associated with Attaching and
Eﬀacing (AEEC) and enterotoxigenic (ETEC) E. coli was evaluated by
PCR assays. A standard PCR was applied to detect the eae (Intimin) gene
[23]. Two ﬁmbrial genes, F41 and F5 (K99), and the enterotoxin heat
stable (STa) gene (associated with ETEC) were determined by a mod-
iﬁed Franck et al. [24] multiplex protocol; E. coli EDL933 and B41 were
used as quality controls.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Animals and sampling

Eighty-two samples were taken from healthy females: 40 samples
(vagina) from dairy (n = 26) and beef (n = 14) cows and 42 samples
(urethra and vagina) from 21 sows housed in both, outdoor (n = 15)
and indoor (n = 6) pig production systems. All these farms were lo-
cated in Tucumán province, in the North-west of Argentina. Preparation
and vaginal sampling collection were performed as previously de-
scribed [20]. Urethral samples were obtained from sows by using a
stainless steel speculum to access the meatus; a sterile cytobrush was
then inserted and rotated on the urethral wall. Then, each cytobrush
was placed in 1 ml phosphate buﬀered saline solution (PBS) containing
tubes, pH 7.0, and kept refrigerated at 4 °C until processing.

2.2. Isolation and identiﬁcation of autochthonous Escherichia coli

Microorganisms were dislodged from the cytobrushes (placed in
PBS tubes) by vigorous agitation and cultured on MacConkey agar
(Britania Laboratories, Argentina) at 37 °C (24 h). Lactose positive co-
lonies (3–4 per plate of each sample) were sub-cultured for bacterial
identiﬁcation. They were subjected to standard biochemical tests (in-
dole, methyl-red-Voges-Proskauer, citrate) for E. coli and conﬁrmed by
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for detection of the β-D-glucur-
onidase gene [11,21]. Primers sequences and annealing temperatures
are indicated in Table 1, templates were prepared from a single colony
(overnight culture on BHI agar, 37 °C) suspended in 50 μl sterile nu-
clease-free water (NFW) and boiled (10 min). The lysed products were
centrifuged (800 × g, 10 min at 4 °C) and their supernatants were
stored (–20 °C). The isolates were stored at −20 °C (BHI with 20%
glycerol).

2.3. Phylogenetic group determination and detection of virulence genes

The isolates

identiﬁed as E. coli were classiﬁed into four

2.4. Antimicrobial susceptibility of Escherichia coli isolates

The antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by the disc diﬀusion
method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
guidelines (CLSI) [25]. The following antibacterial agents were tested:
ampicillin (AMP, 10 μg), amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (AMC, 30 μg),
ceftazidime (CAZ, 30 μg), ceftiofur (CEF, 30 μg), streptomycin (STR,
25 μg), enroﬂoxacin (ENR, 5 μg), tetracycline (TET, 30 μg), trimetho-
prim/sulphamethoxazole (SXT, 1.25/23.75 μg). All antimicrobials were
purchased from Oxoid (UK). The references strains E. coli ATCC25922
and ATCC35218 were used as quality controls. The isolates were clas-
siﬁed as sensitive (S), intermediate (I) and resistant (R), based on CLSI
criteria. For the statistical analyses, isolates classiﬁed as intermediate
(I) were considered resistant [26] and those with simultaneous re-
sistance to three diﬀerent antibiotic-classes were classiﬁed as Multiple
Drug Resistant (MDR) [27].

2.5. Statistical analysis

Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio (95% con-
ﬁdence interval). The diﬀerences in the resistance percentages from
cattle and sows were analyzed (Fisher’s exact test) in a 2 × 2 con-
tingency table.

A contingency table was used to evaluate the relationship between
phylogenetic group and antibiotic resistance proﬁle or the occurrence
of virulence genes (contribution to Chi-square) and a multivariate
analysis of correspondence was performed to show the association be-
tween phylogenetic group and pathogenic characteristics. Data pro-
cessing was carried out with MINITAB (version 14) and Infostat (2015p
Version) software.

3. Results

3.1. Escherichia coli identiﬁcation and phylogenetic characterization

coli.

Eighty-two samples from cows (n = 40) and sows (n = 42) were
analysed to investigate the presence of E.
Isolation of
Enterobacteriaceae was positive in 31 (bovine) and 25 (porcine) samples.
Also, 83.7% (n = 64) and 45.6% (n = 26) of the Enterobacteriaceae
isolates from bovine and porcine groups, respectively, were conﬁrmed
as E. coli. Vaginal colonization of E. coli was statistically higher in cows
(57.5%) than in sows (23.8%) (Fisher’s exact test, p ≤ 0.05). In addi-
tion, no signiﬁcant diﬀerences were observed between vagina and ur-
ethra in sows (data not shown).

A total of 90 E. coli isolates (64 from cows and 26 from sows) were
analysed by PCR and the results indicated that they belong to phylo-
genetic groups A, B1 and D, none of them was classiﬁed as B2. The
prevalence of A was signiﬁcantly higher (p < 0.05 Fisher’s exact test)
than B1 and D; however, there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between
B1 and D. Moreover, a similar distribution of the three phylogenetic
groups detected was observed when interspecies comparisons were
performed (p > 1, Fisher’s exact test) (Table 2). Therefore, in both
cows and sows, the majority of the isolates belonged to phylogenetic
group A while the percentages of isolates belonging to B1 and D were
signiﬁcantly lower (p < 0.05 Fisher’s exact test) (Table 2).

Although a similar phylogenetic structure was detected for cows and
sows, some particular aspects related to farm management were ob-
served. Thus, in dairy farms, a higher prevalence of B1 and lower of D
were observed when compared to beef farms. In pig farms, a diﬀerent
distribution among the phylogenetic groups of indoor and outdoor
systems was detected. Thus, 75% and 25% isolates from indoor farms

belonged to phylogenetic group A and D, respectively; while in outdoor
farms 83% of the isolates belonged to A and 16.67% to B1. Moreover,
no isolate was identiﬁed as D.

3.2. Virulence proﬁle

Ninety E. coli isolates were assessed to identify four intestinal
virulence determinants and 14 (15.6%) showed at least one factor. The
intimin gene (eae) was detected only among isolates from cows (n = 2,
3.13%) but no isolate from dairy cattle showed any of the virulence
factors studied. The ﬁmbrial F41 gene was detected in 5 (7.81%) of the
isolates from cows and 2 (7.61%) from sows. Signiﬁcant diﬀerences
(Fisher's exact test p < 0.05) for the presence of the heat stable en-
terotoxin (STa) gene were observed between E. coli isolates from sows
(19.23%, n = 5) and cows (3.13%, n = 2); however, no isolate was
positive for the F5 ﬁmbria gene. Only 2 isolates (2.22%), one from a
cow and one from a sow, harboured genes coding for at least one ad-
hesion factor and one toxin, which were F41 and STa, respectively.

3.3. Antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance

The prevalence of resistance to antimicrobial agents in both bovine
and porcine isolates from each type of farm (dairy/beef in bovine and
in/outdoor in porcine) is shown in Tables 3–5.

All E. coli isolates were susceptible to CAZ and all bovine isolates
were susceptible to AMC and CEF. The results revealed statistically
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the prevalence of resistance to AMP, AMC and
STR. On the other hand, a low prevalence of SXT resistance was de-
tected in E. coli from both groups (Table 3). Moreover, 61.54% of
porcine isolates were resistant to at least one antibacterial agent,
whereas 30.77% were MDR. Among bovine E. coli, 21.88% were re-
sistant to at least one agent, while 4.69% were MDR (Table 3).

The results showed statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the dis-
tribution of isolates with resistance to at least one agent (p = 0.0005)
as well as in the distribution of MDR isolates (p = 0.0017), they were
higher among the swine isolates than among the bovine group
(Table 3). When evaluating bovine isolates, the highest prevalence of
resistance to at least one antimicrobial agent was observed in dairy
cows isolates (p = 0.015) (Table 4). The prevalence of resistant and
MDR isolates from sows did not show signiﬁcant diﬀerences between
indoor and outdoor farms (Table 5).

3.4. Phylogenetic groups versus virulence proﬁle or antibiotic resistance

The correspondence analysis (Fig. 1) revealed an association

between the presence/absence of the virulence factor and the phylo-
genetic group, regardless of the origin of the isolates. Thus, E. coli with
at least one virulence factor were classiﬁed as belonging to the D group.
In contrast, there was a low probability that B1/A isolates had virulence
factors associated with EPEC or ETEC (Fig. 1)

A similar correspondence analysis was applied to evaluate the as-
sociation between antibiotic resistance proﬁle and phylogenetic group
(Fig. 2). Isolates with susceptibility to the evaluated antibiotics were
only associated with the A group, while E. coli classiﬁed as D were
related to resistance to at least one antibiotic but not to MDR. More-
over, MDR isolates were not related to any particular phylogenetic
group.

4. Discussion

The reproductive performance of female in farming systems is a key
point that aﬀects their productivity, and E. coli is recognized as an
important pathogen that causes metritis in cows and urinary/uterine
infections in sows [3,5]. Several studies have deﬁned the microbial
pathogenic proﬁles that represent a risk for these infections [7,28];
however, no research about the characteristics of autochthonous E. coli
in the cited niches was found. In previous works, our group described
the presence of E. coli in the native vaginal microbiota from healthy
heifers and cows [8,20]. In the present work we are reporting a de-
scription of the phylogenetic structure of native E. coli populations from
the vagina of healthy cows and urogenital tract of sows; also some
virulent factors and antibiotic resistance prevalence were studied in

order to evaluate if there is any diﬀerence regarding the farming sys-
tems examined. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study
describing these aspects in E. coli from native populations in these
speciﬁc niches, which are infection targets with a key impact on the

However, Bok et al. [15] detected diﬀerent phylogenetic structures in
faecal E. coli populations from beef and dairy cattle; these observations
may reﬂect a possible restriction or selection for the microbial coloni-
zation in the reproductive tract; which could be determined by speciﬁc
conditions of these niches regardless of the environment. When asses-
sing the phylogenetic characteristics among native E. coli from the ur-
ogenital tract of sows, some diﬀerences between indoor and outdoor
farming conditions were observed; nevertheless, further studies should
be carried out to determine if there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences.

Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) was reported as responsible for
diarrhoea in farm animals such as pigs, and possesses an adhesin en-
coded by the eae gene named intimin [33]. On the other hand, the
toxigenic pathotype (STEC) is characterized by the presence of intimin
and Shiga-like toxin, implicated in oedema disease (ED) in piglets
whereas in calves and lambs it is associated with diarrhoea and dys-
entery [33]. Based on these reports, we evaluated some intestinal
virulence markers and observed a low prevalence of enteropathogenic
factors among the E. coli isolates in this study. In trials performed in
other species, like giant panda, the vaginal E. coli have not showed any
virulence markers related to diarrheagenic pathotypes [11]. Our study
represents the ﬁrst report about the virulence factors, common to EPEC
(intimin) and ECET (F5, F41 and STa) in autochthonous E. coli from
bovine vagina and porcine vagina/urethra from healthy females. These
characteristics should be taken into account since the ﬁrst colonizers of
the newborn animals will probably be these constituents of the native
microbiota of the maternal reproductive tract [34].

Antimicrobial agents, often used in livestock, belong to the same
classes than those administered in human treatments. Thus, the appli-
cation of antibiotics in farms animals produces a selective pressure al-
lowing the dissemination of resistant bacteria, which represents a risk
to human health [19,35]. Several investigations highlighted the oc-
currence of antibiotic resistance in native intestinal E. coli isolates from
both bovine and swine farming systems [15,18,36,38,39]. However, we
have not found studies addressing antibiotic resistance in native ur-
ogenital E. coli from healthy mothers on these types of farms.

When comparing the antibiotic resistance in both, pigs and cattle,
our ﬁnding showed greater percentage of sensible E. coli among bovine
(78.13%) than in the porcine (38,46%) group. This tendency was also
observed in a polish study for fecal E. coli isolated from sows/piglets
and dairy cows [38]. The diﬀerent levels of resistance probably are due
to diﬀerences in the niche conditions and the technology used in the
farming systems. Furthermore, our results showed higher MDR pre-
valence among porcine E. coli than in bovine. This observation could be
a consequence of the management protocols applied in pigs farming,
which are used worldwide and allow to permanent exposure of the
animal microbiota to sub-therapeutic doses of diﬀerent antibiotics [39].
Studies performed in other regions of Argentina, with greater level of
technology in pig farming than ours, showed high MDR in fecal E. coli,
being 72% in newborn piglets and 94,7% in fattening animals [40]. Our
results show that MDR E. coli are not exclusive to the intestinal mi-
crobiota and that even in modest farming, the resistance prevalence of
potential veterinary pathogens of the reproductive tract, should not be
undervalued.

When evaluating the bovine isolates, the percentage of resistant
E.coli derived from dairy cows was higher than from beef cows; similar
ﬁnding were observed by Bok et al. [15]. They concluded that fecal E.
coli isolates with a high level of antimicrobial resistance are more
prevalent in intensive farms. This does not come as a surprise because it
is well known that antibiotic therapies are more frequents in dairy than
in beef farming systems, in this region of Argentina.

Also, as we expected, the percentage of tetracycline resistance was
signiﬁcantly high for the dairy bovine isolates, since it has been pre-
viously reported that it is commonly applied in cattle not only for the
control and treatment of diseases, but also as a growth promoter [37].
Furthermore, in Argentina, even though the use of antibiotics as feed
additives will be banned from 2019 onwards [41], several antibiotic-

The susceptible isolates were sensible for all antibiotics assayed; those isolates showing
antimicrobial resistance were classiﬁed as NMDR (non-multiple drug resistant) and those
that exhibited simultaneous resistance to antimicrobial agents of at least three diﬀerent
classes were classiﬁed as MDR (multiple drug resistant).

reproductive performance of females in farming systems. Moreover, it is
interesting to evaluate the presence of E. coli in the microbiota of these
tracts, because they represent the main sources of microorganisms that
will colonize the mucosa of the newborn [29]; as well as those that will
access the uterus and cause metritis in the postpartum [30].

Even though E. coli was described as a constituent of the normal
microbiota of the reproductive tract of healthy heifers [8,20] and sows
[9,31]: none of these studies included a phylogenetic description. In the
other hand, the presence and characterization of E. coli from metritic
cows [7] and sows displaying pyelonephritis and dysgalactia has been
widely reported [4,6]. However, to our knowledge there is no available
information regarding the characterization of autochthonous E. coli
from the urogenital tract of sows and vagina of cows. Therefore, in this
work a meticulous sampling method of rigorously selected healthy
animals was carried out to guarantee the isolation of commensal E. coli
from the above mentioned mucosa. Among the Enterobacteriaceae po-
pulation, our results demonstrated a higher proportion of E. coli isolated
from cows than from sows. Similar results were reported by Mshelia
et al. [32], who identiﬁed a high percentage of E. coli (72.5%) from
bovine vaginal Enterobacteriaceae while Bara et al. [9] reported 22.5%
of E. coli from vaginal samples of sows. Moreover, our results showed,
for the ﬁrst time, that there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between E.
coli colonization of vagina and urethra in sows.

We observed a similar phylogenetic conformation in the E. coli po-
pulations from healthy cows and sows which were mainly classiﬁed as
A; but also B1 and D were detected; no isolates were assigned to group
B2. A diﬀerent phylogenetic composition was observed among the E.
coli populations from uterus in postpartum, where the predominant
group was B1 over A and D, with a high presence of hlyE (hemolysin E)
and hlyA (α-hemolysin) genes [13]; probably because the B1 exhibits
better capabilities to colonize in this postpartum environment and
therefore, vaginal B1 E. coli should be studied in much more detail.

The presence of the majority groups A and B1 in the healthy porcine
urethra was not a surprise, since it was observed that the pyelonephritis
producer E. coli with both acute and chronic kidney lesions, belonged to
group A, as well as to group B1 [4]; in our work hypothesis, the normal
urogenital microbial communities include some E. coli populations
which could be able to produce pyelonephritis.

In our study, the farming conditions of both beef and dairy cows did
not aﬀect the distribution of the phylogenetic groups present in vagina.

containing products are still available in local veterinarian supplies
markets.

The results presented here show that the occurrence of resistance
among the native E. coli isolated from the healthy vagina in dairy cows,
was to tetracycline, streptomycin, ampicillin and enroﬂoxacin. If we
think that the vaginal microbiota could harbor potential endometrial-
pathogenic E. coli, it is interesting to highlight that isolates from uterus
of cows with metritis/endometritis, have shown prevalence of above
30% for ampicillin, streptomycin and oxytetracycline [42].

The impact of antibiotic use in the swine industry has been ex-
tensively discussed [37]; however it has not been evaluated in this
microbial niche; and our ﬁndings indicated the presence of resistance to
the same antibiotics previously described in pork [18]; therefore, the
microbiota of the reproductive tract should be under the same level of
surveillance than the intestinal one.

A correspondence analysis allowed us to conclude that the phy-
logroup A was related to the susceptible and D to NMDR. However, no
phylogenetic group was exclusively associated with MDR. Lay et al.
[16] reported that more than 98% of intestinal E.coli from healthy
swine were MDR and belonged to group B1 but none to phylogroup A.
Another study described that 50% of porcine pyelonephritic E. coli were
resistant to four or more antibiotics and the 90% belonged to B1 [43].
Our analysis demonstrated signiﬁcant diﬀerences: B1 isolates showed
resistance against several antibiotics and none from the A group was
resistant to sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim; only one from this latter
group was resistant to ampicillin. Overall, the results presented as well
as the previous evidences, suggest that E. coli from phylogroup A might
have a limitation to acquire antibiotic resistance.

5. Conclusions

This work represents the ﬁrst characterization of autochthonous E.
coli from vagina of healthy cows and from urogenital tract of healthy
sows regarding the association between phylogenetic proﬁle, virulence
factors and antimicrobial resistance; moreover, these results contribute
to the knowledge of extra-intestinal E. coli populations, which could be
implicated in the reproductive health of the females in farms.
