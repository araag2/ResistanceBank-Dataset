ABSTRACT: Occurrence and antimicrobial resistance profiles of Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli strains isolated from fecal samples of 
dogs, pigs, cows and hens in southern Ecuador were studied. Of the 250 samples studied, 84 (33.6%) were Campylobacter positive, with 
C. jejuni being more frequent (78.6%) than C. coli (21.4%), with the exception of porcine samples, from which C. coli was the only species 
isolated. Multidrug resistance was reported in 10 Campylobacter strains (11.9%), four C. jejuni and six C. coli, and was always associated 
with nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin resistance. All of the amoxicillin-resistant strains were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and 
were therefore beta-lactamase producers. However, one strain of C. jejuni remained resistant with additional resistance to gentamycin. This is 
an uncommon resistance pattern in Campylobacter and could reflect different resistance mechanisms.
Key words: Campylobacter, reservoirs, domestic animals, antimicrobial resistance.

RESUMO: A ocorrência e resistência antimicrobiana de cepas de Campylobacter jejuni e C. coli isoladas de amostras fecais obtidas de cães, 
suínos, vacas e galinhas no sul do Equador foram determinadas. Das 250 amostras estudadas, 84 (33.6%) foram Campylobacter positivas, 
sendo C. jejuni mais frequente (78.6%) que C. coli (21.4%) com a exceção das amostras de suínos, das quais só fora isolada a espécie C. 
coli. Multirresistência foi encontrada em 10 cepas (11,9%), quatro C. jejuni e 6 C. coli, sempre associada à resistência ao ácido nalidíxico 
e à ciprofloxacina. Todas as cepas resistentes à ampicilina foram susceptíveis para amoxicilina-ácido clavulánico demonstrando que foram 
produtoras de beta-lactamase. Porém, uma cepa de C. jejuni permaneceu sendo resistente, apresentando, também, resistência à gentamicina. 
Este é um padrão de multirresistência incomum em Campylobacter e pode refletir diferentes mecanismos de resistência.

At present, 27 species and 12 subspecies 
are  included  within  genus  Campylobacter  (LPSN 
BACTERIO.NET, 2016; PICCIRILLO et al., 2016). 
They  are  found  colonizing  the  intestinal  tract  of  a 
wide range of animals, mainly birds and mammals, 
recognized  as  their  reservoir.  Within  these  species, 
Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli have acquired great 
importance  from  a  public  health  perspective,  since 
they  are  considered  as  frequent  zoonotic  agents  of 
diarrhea for human beings worldwide (KAAKOUSH 
et al., 2015; NARVAEZ-BRAVO et al., 2017).

C. jejuni and C. coli have been isolated from 
different animals in several South American countries, 
with  frequencies  ranging  from  16.96%  in  dogs  to 
94% in chickens (FERNÁNDEZ, 2011). In Ecuador, 
the information about these bacteria is scarce, with a 
limited number of publications available.  VASCO et 
al. (2016) reported C. jejuni and C. coli in samples 
from chickens (76.2%), dogs (27.5%), pigs (47.2%) 
and  cattle  (28.6%)  in  a  semirural  community  East 
of Quito; whereas VINUEZA et al. (2017) reported

Occurrence and antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli isolated from domestic animals...Ciência Rural, v.48, n.11, 2018.2

in 

in  Pichincha  province.  In  Southern  Ecuador,  these 
bacteria were previously isolated from fecal samples 
of dogs (10%) (TOLEDO et al., 2015), chicken livers 
used for human consumption (62.7%) (SIMALUIZA 
et al., 2015) and domestic backyard chickens (41.7%) 
(OCHOA et al., 2016).

With 

the  goal 

to  establish, 

the 
southern  region  of  Ecuador,  the  occurrence  and 
the antimicrobial resistance of C. jejuni and C. coli 
isolated from a reduced sample of domestic animals 
(dogs, pigs, cows and hens) commonly considered as 
reservoirs for these bacteria.

Fecal  samples,  obtained  by  spontaneous 
emission  from  250  domestic  animals  raised  around 
Loja city (3°59’ Lat S; 79°12’ Long W) were studied. 
Taking into consideration that the owners only allowed 
to  sample  a  limited  number  of  animals,  sampling 
was performed using a non-probabilistic method for 
convenience. The studied animals were 60 pet dogs, 
obtaining 20 samples from three different veterinary 
clinics; 30 fattening pigs obtaining 15 samples from 
two pigs farms; 100 dairy cows obtaining 25 samples 
from  four  different  farms  and  60  backyard  hens 
obtaining 15 samples from three different farms.

Following  collection,  each  fecal  sample 
was inoculated onto a transport-enrichment medium 
(FERNÁNDEZ, 1992) consisting of (composition/L) 
Brucella broth 28g, agar 1.5g, sodium metabisulphite 
0.5g,  ferrous  sulphate  0.5g,  sodium  pyruvate  0.5g, 
trimethoprim  10mg, 
rifampicin  15mg,  colistin 
10,000IU,  amphotericin  10mg  and  horse  blood 
30mL,  and  transported  to  the  laboratory  under  a 
microaerobic atmosphere obtained using commercial 
generator envelopes (FERNÁNDEZ, 1992; TOLEDO 
et  al.  2017). After  an  enrichment  period  of  24h  at 
42°C under microaerobic conditions, aliquots of each 
enriched  sample  were  seeded  on  Butzler  medium 
plates and incubated for 48h under the same conditions 
described  above.  Suspected  colonies  were  initially 
identified  by  phenotypic  test  (Gram  stain,  oxidase, 

to 

catalase,  hippurate  and  indoxylacetate  ''hydrolysis) 
and confirmed by the multiplex PCR test as described 
by YAMAZAKI-MATSUNE et al. (2007).

nalidixic 

Susceptibility 

acid, 
ciprofloxacin,  erythromycin,  gentamycin,  amoxicillin 
and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was determined by the 
disk diffusion method following the recommendations 
for  Campylobacter  of  the  European  Committee  on 
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing - EUCAST (SIFRÉ 
et al., 2015). Amoxicillin resistant strains were tested for 
β-lactamase production using the cefinase β-lactamase 
detection discs and the disc diffusion susceptibility test 
for  amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid  (LACHANCE  et  al., 
1991; IOVINE, 2013). The differences between groups 
was assessed by a Ji-squared test.

As shown in table 1, 33.6% of the samples 
were  positive  for  Campylobacter  sp.  The  highest 
isolation  rate  was  reported  among  hens  (68.3%), 
followed  by  dogs  (33.3%),  pigs  (26.7%)  and  cows 
(15%). Similar distribution was reported by VASCO 
et al. (2016) in Central Ecuador; however, with some 
differences  in  the  isolation  percentages  in  chickens 
76.2%,  pigs  47.2%,  dogs  27.5%  and  cattle  28.6%. 
Both Campylobacter species have been isolated from 
these animals in different South American countries, 
also  with  high  frequencies  (FERNÁNDEZ,  2011), 
thus  indicating  that  these  animals  are  important 
reservoirs  of 
in  South  America. 
Therefore,  it  would  be  important  to  establish  the 
existence  of 
relationship 
between strains isolated from these animal reservoirs 
and  cases  of  diarrhea  in  humans.  Previous  studies 
have demonstrated that Campylobacter isolates from 
humans  exhibited  characteristics  identical  to  those 
isolated  from  domestic  animals  (ISHIHARA  et  al., 
2006; GONZÁLEZ-HEIN et al., 2013).

Ciência Rural, v.48, n.11, 2018.Toledo et al.of C. coli isolates, compared to the total isolates of both 
species,  was  21.4%,  which  is  consistent  with  the  C. 
jejuni/C. coli ratio (close to 25%) observed in different 
types of samples in several countries in South America 
(FERNÁNDEZ,  2011).  The  isolation  of  C.  coli  as 
the only species in pigs is not surprising, since these 
animals  are  considered  the  primary  reservoir  from 
which C. coli  is isolated in high frequency (ALTER 
et al., 2005; GEBREYES et al., 2005) or as the only 
species (KEMPF et al., 2017).

Table 2 shows the antimicrobial resistance 
of  the  tested  Campylobacter  strains.  Multidrug 
resistance,  defined  as  the  resistance  to  three  or 
more antimicrobials (HAKANEN et al., 2003), was 
reported  in  10  strains  (11.9%),  four  corresponding 
to C. jejuni and six to C. coli. Multidrug resistance 
was  always  associated  with  nalidixic  acid  and 
ciprofloxacin resistance since all 10 strains exhibited 
resistance to both antimicrobials. The association of 
multidrug resistance with fluoroquinolone resistance 
was  described  in  clinical  strains  by  HAKANEN  et 

3

al., in 2003. Currently, fluoroquinolone resistance in 
Campylobacter species is an emerging public health 
problem  in  several  Latin  American  countries,  and 
is  frequently  associated  with  multidrug  resistance 
(FERNÁNDEZ & PÉREZ-PÉREZ, 2016; VINUEZA 
et al., 2017).

Some peculiarities could be observed from 
the results shown in table 2. All of the strains of C. 
jejuni and C. coli isolated from dogs were susceptible 
to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. This is in contrast 
with  the  previous  data  from  Latin  America  where 
Campylobacter  strains  resistant  to  fluoroquinolones 
were  reported  among  pet  dogs  (FERNÁNDEZ  & 
PÉREZ-PÉREZ, 2016; TOLEDO et al., 2015). It is 
plausible that the results could be associated with the 
condition  of  these  pets,  since  they  are  not  exposed 
with the same frequency to the transmission factors 
of  Campylobacter  as  feral  dogs  (IANNINO  et  al., 
2017).  Besides,  fluoroquinolones  are  not  first-line 
antimicrobials in the treatment of some infections in 
domestic dogs (GUARDABASSI et al., 2004). All of

Occurrence and antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli isolated from domestic animals...Ciência Rural, v.48, n.11, 2018.4

the strains isolated from pigs were C. coli and all were 
resistant to quinolones. High resistance to quinolones 
has been shown in C. coli strains isolated from pigs 
(THAKUR & GEBREYES, 2005; QIN et al., 2011).
All  of  the  strains,  except  one  strain 
of  C  jejuni,  were  susceptible  to  gentamycin  and 
amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid.  In  previous  studies 
conducted  in  Southern  Ecuador,  no  resistance 
was  observed  in  either  C.  jejuni  or  in  C.  coli 
strains isolated from dogs (TOLEDO et al., 2015), 
backyard  chickens  (OCHOA  et  al.,  2016)  and 
healthy children (TOLEDO et al., 2017). All of the 
amoxicillin-resistant  strains  were  cefinase  positive 
and  susceptible  to  amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid  and 
are,  therefore,  beta-lactamase  producers  (IOVINE, 
2013), with the exception of one strain of C. jejuni 
that  remained  resistant.  This  particular  strain  was 
also  gentamycin  resistant,  showing  an  uncommon 
resistance  pattern  whose  genetic  determinants 
should be investigated in future studies. Resistance 
to amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was 
tested because these antibiotics are recommended for 
the treatment of systemic Campylobacter infections, 
similarly  to  aminoglycosides  and  fluoroquinolones 
(SIFRÉ et al., 2015).
