Salmonella spp. can indirectly infect humans via transfer from animals and animal-derived
food products, and thereby cause potentially fatal diseases. Therefore, gaining an
understanding of Salmonella infection in farm animals is increasingly important. The aim
of this study was to identify the distribution of serotypes in Salmonella samples isolated
from chickens (n = 837), pigs (n = 930), and dairy cows (n = 418) in central China
(Henan, Hubei, and Hunan provinces) in 2010–2011, and investigate the susceptibility of
strains to antimicrobial agents. Salmonella isolates were identiﬁed by PCR ampliﬁcation
of the invA gene, serotypes were determined by using a slide agglutination test for O
and H antigens, and susceptibility to 24 antimicrobials was tested using the agar dilution
method. In total, 248 Salmonella strains were identiﬁed: 105, 105, and 38 from chickens,
dairy cows, and pigs, respectively. Additionally, 209 strains were identiﬁed in diseased
pigs from the Huazhong Agricultural University veterinary hospital. Among these 457
strains, the dominant serotypes were Typhimurium in serogroup B, IIIb in serogroup C,
and Enteritidis in serogroup D. In antimicrobial susceptibility tests, 41.14% of Salmonella
spp. were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents, 48.14% were resistant to at least one,
and 34.72% were resistant to more than three classes. Strains were highly resistant to
sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (39.61%), nalidixic acid (39.17%), doxycycline (28.22%),
and tetracycline (27.58%). Resistance to cephalosporins and ﬂuoroquinolones ranged
from 5.25 to 7.44% and 19.04 to 24.51%, respectively. Among penicillin-resistant and
cephalosporin-resistant strains, 25 isolates produced extended-spectrum β-lactamases
(ESBLs). The multidrug-resistant and ESBL-producing Salmonella strains identiﬁed in
healthy animals here will present a challenge for veterinary medicine and farm animal
husbandry, and could also pose a threat to public health. The level of antibiotic resistance
observed in this study further highlights the need for careful and selective use of
antibiotics.

Introduction

in the USA,

Salmonella spp. are a common source of foodborne diseases
that cause morbidity and mortality worldwide (Chiu et al.,
2010). Treating Salmonella infection in humans is expensive;
it causes illness in ∼1.2 million
for example,
patients annually, resulting in estimated medical costs of $365
million (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014). In
the European Union (EU), salmonellosis is the second most
commonly reported gastrointestinal infection, with a conﬁrmed
case rate of 20.4 cases per 100,000 individuals in 2011 (European
Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2013). In China,
Salmonella causes an estimated 22.2% of foodborne diseases
(Wang et al., 2007), and salmonellosis ranks fourth among the
most prevalent foodborne diseases caused by microbial agents
(Zhu et al., 2012). Many Salmonella serotypes exist, with >2600
serovars classiﬁed based on the reactivity of antisera to O
and H antigens (Stevens et al., 2009), and ∼292 identiﬁed in
China between the 1980s and the end of 2000 (Yang, 2010).
Salmonella also aﬀects farm animals, and infections on farms can
cause substantial economic damage in relation to, for example,
loss of poultry stocks and costly animal husbandry. Numerous
serotypes of isolated Salmonella have been found to overlap
between farm animals and humans (Alcaine et al., 2006). Indeed,
Salmonella not only directly infects humans but also causes
indirect infections via transfer from animals and animal-derived
food products such as pork and milk.

The use of antimicrobials is important

for the control
and treatment of Salmonella. However, since the early 1990s,
antimicrobial- and multidrug-resistant Salmonella strains have
emerged, leading to treatment failure. Researchers have reported
a link between the use of antimicrobials in food animals
and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic
bacteria (Gong et al., 2013). Multidrug-resistant bacteria pose
a severe threat to public health, particularly those that are
resistant to β-lactams and ﬂuoroquinolones (Lai et al., 2014).
The increasing number of multidrug-resistant Salmonella strains
is a global concern, with some countries and international
organizations creating surveillance systems which include
collaboration between human health, veterinary, and food-
related sectors to monitor the spread of
these and other
foodborne bacteria. Examples include the Danish Integrated
Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring and Research Program, the
European Food Safety Authority, the National Antimicrobial
Resistance Monitoring System in the USA, and the Global
Foodborne Infections Network run by the World Health
Organization. These surveillance systems are also employed to
monitor antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial consumption in
livestock, and serotype distribution, and data describing the
current trend of increasing resistance to multiple drugs has been
made available (European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Control, 2013). In contrast, surveillance reports are unavailable
in China; however, the National Monitoring Network for Bacteria
of Animal Origin was launched as a surveillance system in
2008. Travel, migration, and the distribution of food between
countries can also contribute to the spread of foodborne diseases
and multidrug-resistant bacteria. Therefore, monitoring the

distribution of Salmonella serotypes and levels of antibiotic
resistance in animals and animal-food products is also important
for maintaining safe travel and the commercial trade in food
animals (Lai et al., 2014; Russell et al., 2014).

In central China, Henan, Hubei, and Hunan provinces are
important residential and trade centers. These three areas are
also the main producers of animal-derived foods in China; in
2012, their output of meat, eggs, and milk accounted for 19.14%,
19.45%, and 9.17% of total Chinese production, respectively
(China Agriculture Statistical Report, 2012). Previous studies
documented a phenotype for Salmonella serovars that was
discovered in chickens and pigs, and in animal-derived foods, in
China (Gong et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013; Lai et al., 2014; Wang
et al., 2014). However, speciﬁc knowledge of the Salmonella
serovars that exist in dairy cows and other farm animals in
central China is currently lacking. Therefore, the aim of this
study was to evaluate the prevalence of Salmonella in chickens,
pigs, and dairy cows on farms in central China. Additionally, the
diversity of Salmonella serovars on these farms was identiﬁed,
and their susceptibility and resistance to antimicrobial agents
was investigated. A diverse range of serotypes was observed
in healthy and diseased farm animals, and several multidrug-
resistant and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing
Salmonella strains were identiﬁed.

Materials and Methods
Samples and Salmonella Isolation
Cloacal and anal swabs were collected from healthy animals on
farms in Henan, Hubei, and Hunan provinces between March
2010 and July 2011. Each sampling site was visited only once.
In total, 2185 samples were collected in a random manner from
chickens (n = 837), pigs (n = 930), and dairy cows (n =
418). Farms were chosen based on their scale with the following
requirements: for pigs, annual sales were >10,000 heads; for
chickens, the breeding stock was >100,000 heads; and for dairy
cows, the breeding stock was >1000 heads. The owners of each
farm gave permission for swab samples to be to collected. The
animals from which samples were extracted remained alive,
did not undergo any surgery, and were not administered any
drugs. Therefore, ethical approval was not required for the study
because the sampling process did not harm the animals; however,
their distress was considered and minimized at all times. All
collected samples were stored at 4 ◦C and cultured at least 24 h
before the isolation experiments were conducted.

The procedure for culture and isolation was based on
standard laboratory protocol
(WHO Global Foodborne
Infections Network, 2010). Brieﬂy, the samples were mixed
with 5 mL of 0.85% saline solution for 30 min, and 1 mL of
this mixture solution was added to buﬀered peptone water
(BPW; Hopebiol, Qingdao, China) at a volume ratio of 1:10.
The resultant mixture was incubated for 10 h at 37 ◦C for pre-
enrichment. Approximately 500 μL of this BPW mixture was
then added to 5 mL selenite cystine broth (Hopebiol, Qingdao,
China) and incubated at 37 ◦C for 20 h. The broth was streaked
onto CHROMagar Salmonella (CHROMagar, France) and

incubated at 37 ◦C for 24–48 h. Potential Salmonella colonies
were transferred into Luria–Bertani agar for puriﬁcation and
enrichment, and then incubated for 20 h at 37 ◦C to facilitate
identiﬁcation.

Additionally, 209 strains of Salmonella were

isolated
from samples collected from diseased pigs in the Huazhong
Agricultural University veterinary hospital (HAUvh) between
2008 and 2010.

Salmonella Identiﬁcation
Biochemical testing and the invA gene were used to conﬁrm
the identity of isolates with typical Salmonella phenotypes.
Biochemical testing was performed using a biochemical tube
(Hangzhou Microbe Reagent Co., Ltd., China), and the results
were interpreted based on Bergey’s Manual of Systematic
Bacteriology (Garrity et al., 2004). The invA gene was ampliﬁed
by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Malorny et al., 2003).
Positive results were randomly selected for sequencing. The
obtained sequences were compared with the same gene registered
in GenBank by using BLAST.

Determination of Salmonella Serogroup and
Serotype
The serogroup and serovars of the Salmonella isolates were
determined by slide agglutination tests with O antigen and H
antigen antiserums obtained from Lansheng, Lanzhou Institute
of Biology, China. The results were interpreted according to the
Kauﬀmann-White scheme (Grimont and Weill, 2007).

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing
The agar dilution method with Mueller-Hinton agar (Oxoid
Ltd., England) was used to test the susceptibility of Salmonella
to 24 antibiotics (Table 1). These antimicrobials were classiﬁed
based on their importance to human medicine (Government
of Canada, 2005). Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was used
as the control microorganism. The results of the tests for
ampicillin (AMP), amoxicillin (AMX), amoxicillin-clavulanic
acid (AMC), ceftriaxone (CRO), imipenem (IPM), aztreonam
(ATM), gentamicin (GEN), amikacin (AMK), tetracycline (TET),
doxycycline (DOX), ciproﬂoxacin (CIP),
levoﬂoxacin (LEV),
nalidixic acid (NAL), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SXT),
chloramphenicol (CHL), and fosfomycin (FOS) were interpreted
based on CLSI M100-S22 (Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute, 2012), whereas those for ceftiofur (CEF), enroﬂoxacin
(ENO), and ﬂorfenicol (FFC) were interpreted based on CLSI
M31-A3 (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2008).
Interpretive CLSI criteria were not available for cefquinome
(CEQ), polymyxin B (PB), azithromycin (AZM), olaquindox
(OLA), and mequindox (MEQ); therefore, results with the
following minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values
were considered resistant for these antibiotics: CEQ ≥8 μg/mL
(using CEF as a reference); PB ≥4 μg/mL (Kwa et al., 2007);
AZM ≥16 μg/mL (Sjölund-Karlsson et al., 2011); OLA and
MEQ ≥64 μg/mL (Sørensen et al., 2003).

Strains that were resistant to AMP, AMX, ATM, and/or CRO
were examined for ESBLs by using the MIC values of ceftazidime,
ceftazime-clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, and cefotaxime-clavulanic

self-agglutination in sterile saline. Twenty-eight isolates could
self-agglutination in sterile saline, but such activity was not
observed with O antigen. The serogroups of the remaining
395 strains were determined. Eight distinct serogroups and 41
distinct serotypes were identiﬁed, as shown in Table 2. Group
B (n = 205, 44.86%) and group C1 (n = 141, 30.85%)
were identiﬁed as the dominant serogroups. Typhimurium
12.47% (n = 57) and IIIb 4.81% (n = 22) were the
dominant serovars. Detailed serotypes could not be determined
for 208 Salmonella isolates using the available H antigen in the
diﬀerent serogroups. According to the species of animal tested,
the dominant serotypes were Typhimurium and Enteritidis in
chickens, IIIb and Typhimurium in pigs, and Typhimurium and
Agona in dairy cows (Table 2).

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing
Results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing are summarized in
Table 3. Among the 457 isolates, 188 (41.14%) were susceptible
to all tested antimicrobials and 220 (48.14%) were resistant
to at least one antibiotic. All strains showed susceptibility
or intermediate susceptibility to imipenem. Strains were most
commonly resistant to nalidixic acid (39.17%), sulfamethoxazole-
trimethoprim (39.61%), doxycycline (28.22%), and tetracycline
(27.58%). They also showed resistance to all specialist drugs used
only in veterinary medicine, including enroﬂoxacin (24.51%),
ﬂorfenicol (20.13%), ceftiofur (7.44%), and cefquinome (5.25%),
and to drugs used in both veterinary and human medicine,
such as ciproﬂoxacin (24.07%), gentamicin (19.69%), ceftriaxone
(6.34%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (4.38%). Resistance to
azithromycin, which is one of the macrolides often used against
gram-positive bacteria, was expressed at 16.19%. Although they
are rarely used in clinical applications, resistance to polymyxin B
(18.82%) and fosfomycin (12.04%) was also observed.

When antibiotic resistance was analyzed according to animal
species, the resistance rates of Salmonella were diﬀerent for the
majority of the drugs tested (Table 4). Excluding imipenem,
resistance to the other 23 drugs ranged from 1.90 to 49.52% in
chickens and 0.40 to 48.18% in pigs. In comparison, Salmonella
from dairy cows showed resistance to 12 types of drug, and
resistance rates ranged from 0.95 to 10.48%.

In total, 159 strains (34.72%) exhibited varying degrees of
multidrug resistance (MDR) (Table 5), deﬁned as resistance to at
least three diﬀerent classes of antimicrobials. The Salmonella spp.
that exhibited MDR consisted of 104 strains from pigs (including
15 and 89 strains from healthy and diseased pigs, respectively),
51 strains from healthy chickens, and 4 strains from healthy dairy
cows. MDR isolates showed diverse resistance to diﬀerent classes
of antibiotics, but were most frequently resistant to penicillins,
ﬂuoroquinolones, and quinolones (each occurring 11 times). β-
lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations appeared with the
lowest frequency (ﬁve times) in Salmonella strains with MDR.

Based on analysis of MIC values and CLSI, 25 of the 457
isolates (5.47%) were conﬁrmed as ESBL producers, with three
suspected strains (Table 6). The ESBL-producing strains were
obtained from diﬀerent animals and areas as follows: two strains
from chickens in Hubei, 15 strains from chickens in Henan, and
eight strains from diseased pigs. Because the diﬀerences in MIC

values between CAZ, CAZ/C and/or CTX, and CTX/C were not
=3-fold based on CLSI, three strains from diseased pigs were
suspected to be ESBL-producing strains.

The Salmonella serotypes of isolates diﬀered in terms of their
sensitivity to drugs (Table 7). Among all drug-sensitive isolates
(n = 188), 80 isolates were identiﬁed in 17 speciﬁc serotypes.
Typhimurium (n = 28) was the major serotype. Isolates of
Salmonella strains with MDR showed 26 speciﬁc serotypes and
the major serotypes were Enteritidis and IIIb (both n = 10).
All serotypes were resistant to nalidixic acid, but diﬀerences
were observed in the resistance proﬁles of Salmonella serotypes
that exhibited MDR. The most common resistance proﬁles in
Salmonella IIIb (n = 10) and Enteritidis isolates (n = 10) were
AMP-AMX-SXT-NAL and SXT-OLA-MEQ-NAL, respectively.
The resistance proﬁle was AMP-AMX-TET-DOX-ENO-SXT-
CHL-NAL in Typhimurium (n = 6), TET-DOX-CIP-ENO-SXT-
CHL-FFC-NAL in Schwabach (n = 4), and PB-OLA-MEQ-NAL
in Kouka (n = 4).

Discussion

The prevalence of Salmonella spp. in the center of China were
in agreement with those obtained from Sichuan province farm
animals (Li et al., 2013), but diﬀered from other areas. The
results were higher than in EU (European Food Safety Authority,
2014), where chicken 2.7%, pig 6.3%, cattle 2.4%, but were lower
than in USA (National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring
System, 2011), where chicken 52.56% ∼ 47.95%, pig 10.34% ∼
8.79%, cattle 23.02% ∼ 33.20%. Diﬀerences in isolation rates
can be interpreted based on diﬀerences in region, sample types,
collection seasons, culture methods, isolation methodologies,
culture media, and local environmental conditions. For example,
salmonellosis cases increased over the summer months, peaking
in August and September, began decreasing thereafter (European
Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2013). Therefore,
a global perspective should ideally be adopted during sample
collection,
long-term
monitoring.

isolate separation, and,

in particular,

The prevalence of Salmonella serotypes diﬀered among
animals and regions. Serogroup B and C1 were dominant, this
result was consistent with in USA (Antunes et al., 2011). Serotype
diﬀer from other study. The dominant in chicken, pig, dairy cattle
were Typhimurium and Enteritidis, IIIb and Typhimurium,
Typhimurium and Agona in this study, respectively. The
dominant serotype from chicken were Derby and Typhimurium
in Sichuan province (Li et al., 2013), from pig were Enteritidis
Indianain in Shandong province (Lai et al., 2014). The dominant
from chicken, pig, cattle were Kentucky and Enteritidis, Adelaide
and Johannesburg, Montevideo and Dublin in USA (National
Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System, 2011); and from
chicken, pig, cattle were Enteritidis and Infantis, Typhimurium
and Typhimurium (monophasic), Typhimurium and Dublin in
EU (European Food Safety Authority, 2014). This diﬀerence
suggests serogroups and serotypes are varying according to
geographical regions, and diversities and complexities. Certain
serovars can emerge within a country or region for a certain
period and then disappear with no evident cause or intervention.

For instance, compared with data in 2010, the number of
Enteritidis and Typhimurium decreased by 6% and 9% in
2011, respectively, (European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Control, 2013); similar, compared with results in 2009, Enteritidis
decreased, even disappeared from chicken and pig in 2012 from
Shandong province (Lai et al., 2014).

The Salmonella serotypes

isolated from farm animals
overlapped with those that cause illnesses in humans, further
highlighting the fact that Salmonella could be transmitted from
animals to humans via the food chain (Alcaine et al., 2006;
de Jong et al., 2009), such as Typhimurium and Enteritidis
had identiﬁed from human in Henan and Hubei provinces
(Cui et al., 2009; Xia et al., 2009). Some researchers have
suggested that the diﬀerences in the dominant serotypes between
animals and humans might be due to variations in their
pathogenicity and corresponding resistance proﬁles (Volf et al.,
2010),
the strain containing Typhimurium and Enteritidis
could acquired resistance to a large number of diﬀerent
antimicrobial compounds. At least two diﬀerent serotypes existed
from multiple-two strains to multiple-eleven strains, especially
Enteritidis and Typhimurium, which were similar with other
study from animals (Li et al., 2013; European Food Safety

Authority, 2014; Lai et al., 2014), also with human (Cui et al.,
2009; Xia et al., 2009). This may be related to the presence of the
genetic structure known as Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1)
and resistance genes (European Food Safety Authority, 2014).
Therefore, monitoring of Salmonella should preferably focus
more strongly on serovars that could, for example, be involved
in a large outbreak.

Based on our MIC analysis, antibiotic-resistant bacteria,
including multidrug-resistant bacteria, appeared in both healthy
and diseased farm animals. These results were similar with other
study (Gong et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013; Lai et al., 2014). One
potential explanation is the use of antibiotics during breeding.
Disease control and prevention in China during the breeding
process mainly depends on the use of antibiotics (Gong et al.,
2013). This arguably irrational use of antibiotics has contributed
to the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria under selective
antimicrobial pressure. Huazhong area (Henan, Hubei, and
Hunan provinces) is one of the more concentrated areas of
farm animals (China Agriculture Statistical Report, 2012), the
demands and uses of drugs are huge, then inevitable there would
be unreasonable use of drugs. These drugs, or the raw materials
of the drugs, are inexpensive and easy to obtain; they have been
widely used on animals in China. However, some steps have
been taken to prevent the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria
and promote food safety and public health with the Ministry of
Agriculture of the People’s Republic of China having formulated
plans to ban or reduce the use of speciﬁc antimicrobials (Ministry
of Agriculture of the People’s Republic of China, 2002).

After the therapeutic eﬀects of antimicrobials were conﬁrmed
in humans in the mid-1940s, they were soon introduced to
veterinary medicine (McEwen, 2006). Even though some drugs
were exclusively designed for veterinary use, the compounds
administered are identical or very similar to those used in
human medicine because they belong to the same antimicrobial
classes (Heuer et al., 2009) such as β-lactams, cephalosporins,
aminoglycosides, macrolides,
sulfonamides,
ﬂuoroquinolones. Most of the antibiotic resistance to diﬀerent
classes has appeared in humans, animals, and/or animal

products. Ceftriaxone had showed resistance rates ≤13% and 4%
from imported foods and humans (Akiyama and Khan, 2012;
Wong et al., 2014). Similar, gentamicin had shown resistance
in animals and humans (Lai et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2014).
Overlapping resistance not only can lead to treatment failure, but
also have negative consequences in both humans and animals.

ESBL-producing Salmonella strains were isolated from
chickens and pigs in diﬀerent areas in this study. Currently,
the resistance genes were still on attempting to identify and
sequencing from the samples. The emergence of producing-
ESBLs bacteria in animals and animal products is of particular
concern to public health, it allow bacteria to become resistant
to a wide variety of penicillins and cephalosporins. ESBL-
producing bacteria have appeared in poultry, pig, and cattle
farms (Horton et al., 2011; European Food Safety Authority,
In Salmonella, acquisition of resistance genes was
2014).
likely to have occurred by conjugation, usually with other
Enterobacteriaceae through the transfer of plasmids (European
Food Safety Authority, 2014). Bacteria that develop resistance
via ESBLs could become a reservoir of resistance genes, which
may enter the food chain (European Food Safety Authority,
2012). When antibiotic resistance occurs during infection, the

remaining treatment option is usually an antibiotic from the
carbapenem family. While carbapenems were previously drugs
of last resort, their use is now also contributing to resistance
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014). They are
used to treat highly resistant infections in humans, and are
not used in food-producing animals. However, carbapenemase-
producing organisms have been isolated from farm animals
(Fischer et al., 2012). In China, monitoring strategies do not
currently contain testing and identiﬁcation of ESBL- or AmpC-
producing organisms in isolates from animals and/or animal-
derived food products. It suggest that this should be established
within surveillance procedures to anticipate possible changes in
the status of ESBL enzymes.

Salmonella isolates showed multiple-resistance in results, it
suggested the emergence of co-resistance and/or cross-resistance
(Cantón and Ruiz-Garbajosa, 2011). For example, amikacin
had showed low levels of resistance (0.67%); this may be due
to cross-resistance among aztreonam, ciproﬂoxacin, and β-
lactams (Livermore, 2002). Co-resistance to ﬂuoroquinolones
and third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins has also been
identiﬁed in Salmonella isolated from humans (Zhang et al.,
2014). Considering these results, the prudent use of antibacterial

Serotypes, antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella spp.

agents should be strongly recommended in clinical, veterinary,
and agricultural settings in order to preserve antibiotic activity
and avoid the development of cross-resistance.

In previous studies, researchers have demonstrated the
relationship between the increased prevalence of antimicrobial-
resistant bacteria and (a) the increased use of antimicrobials in
human and veterinary medicine, (b) greater movement of people
and animals, and (c) increased industrialization (Cheng et al.,
2012). Huazhong is central to China; this area not only meets
the needs of its own people via the production of animals and
food but also supplies other areas and imports animals and food
from other regions. This movement is a potential contributor to
the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The environment itself
also contains a variety of bacteria that potentially represent an
immense pool of antibiotic-resistance genes, which if transferred
between bacteria could cause human and animal disease (D’Costa
et al., 2006). For example, wild animals that are carriers
of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria could pass on colonies of
resistant strains when they encounter humans, farming areas,
and/or waste (Literak et al., 2011). A limitation of our study
was that the samples were only collected from farm animals. For
complete consideration in a surveillance system, samples should
also be collected from, for example, the farm environment and
farm workers.

Despite bans and legislation, some antibiotics are still
routinely fed to livestock prophylactically to increase proﬁts
and to limit potential bacterial
infections in stressed and
crowded livestock (Ndi and Barton, 2011). Antibiotic-resistant
bacteria will inevitably follow wherever antimicrobials are used;
therefore, a coordinated multi-disciplinary approach will be
required to address this issue (Smith et al., 2009). Various
programs around the world have been established to monitor
and control antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Recently, an oﬃcial
document, “National Medium- and Long-Term Planning for

Prevention and Control of Animal Epidemics (2012 to 2020),”
(General Oﬃce of State Council of China, 2012) was issued
in China. The government outlined plans to control diseases
by detection and puriﬁcation using a medium- or long-term
program, with the aim of reducing the antimicrobials used in
animals and in symptomatic treatment. In future, the safest way
to prevent the problem may be reducing antimicrobial usage with
strict policies and legislation to control the development and
spread of resistant bacteria in animals.
