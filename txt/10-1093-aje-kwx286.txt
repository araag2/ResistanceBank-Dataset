ABSTRACT 

 

Small-scale production poultry operations are increasingly common worldwide. To 

investigate how these operations influence antimicrobial resistance and mobile genetic elements 

(MGEs), E. coli isolates were sampled from small-scale production birds (raised in confined 

spaces with antibiotics in feed), household birds (no movement constraints; fed on scraps), and 

humans associated with these birds in rural Ecuador (2010-2012). Isolates were screened for 

genes associated with MGEs as well as phenotypic resistance to 12 antibiotics. Isolates from 

small-scale production birds had significantly elevated odds of resistance to seven antibiotics and 

all MGE genes compared to household birds (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) range: 2.2-87.9). Isolates 

from humans associated with small-scale production birds had elevated odds of carrying an 

integron (aOR=2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06, 3.83) compared to humans associated 

with household birds, as well as sulfisoxazole (aOR=1.9; 95% CI: 1.01, 3.60) and 

trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (aOR=2.1; 95% CI: 1.13, 3.95) resistance. Stratifying by the 

presence of MGEs revealed antibiotic groups that are explained by biological links to MGEs; in 

particular, sulfisoxazole, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline resistance were 

highest among birds and humans when MGE exposures were present. Small-scale production 

poultry operations may select for isolates carrying MGEs, contributing to elevated levels of 

resistance in this setting.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens global health by increasing morbidity and 

mortality, complicating treatment, and increasing health care costs (1). Therapeutic and non-

therapeutic antibiotic use among humans and animals contribute to community and 

environmental reservoirs of AMR, such as those found in livestock operations (2). Antibiotic use 

among animals in the USA is four times higher by weight than among humans, and remains 

largely unregulated and undocumented (3–6).  

Poultry production is a quickly expanding form of livestock farming worldwide (7). In 

developed nations with industrial-scale operations, thousands of birds are often raised in 

confined spaces with feed or water laced with antibiotics (given for the purposes of disease 

prevention, treatment, and/or growth promotion). Higher frequencies of AMR have been found 

in poultry from these production operations compared to free-range birds not exposed to 

antibiotics (8). In addition, isolates from humans associated with different types of production 

poultry operations with varying degrees of antibiotic usage have similar resistance frequencies 

and profiles to those found in corresponding poultry isolates (9), and higher resistance 

frequencies when compared to humans in the surrounding community not associated with 

production operations (10,11).  However, poultry farms worldwide are dominated by small-scale 

production operations (<100 birds), particularly in developing nations where poultry are raised 

for income and/or household consumption (12,13). While a small number of studies have 

documented high levels of AMR in poultry in small-scale production operations (14–16), not all 

of these studies have appropriate non-production bird or human comparisons (non-clinical, from 

the immediate surrounding community), and so less is known about AMR development and 

transmission within these settings.

ORIGINAL UNEDITED MANUSCRIPT  

While many of these studies investigate resistant phenotypes, genetic factors also mark 

AMR spread. Mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as integrons and plasmids, transfer genes 

conveying phenotypic resistance among diverse bacterial genera. Certain phenotypic resistance 

profiles may be associated with different MGEs; genes conveying resistance to tetracycline are 

often found on plasmids (17), and some integron types contain a gene conveying resistance to 

sulfonamides at the 3’ end of the integron structure (18). The high prevalence of MGEs 

documented in industrial-scale poultry operations from developed nations may contribute to 

elevated frequencies of AMR in these operations (19). A diverse array of AMR genes have been 

found in integrons located on plasmids, making them a common mechanism for horizontal 

spread of AMR and multi-drug resistance (MDR) (20), and MGEs may be more important than 

bacterial cells in the transmission of AMR genes from livestock to humans (21).  

The construction of a road in Esmeraldas province, Ecuador, has led to an influx of 

small-scale production poultry (chicken) operations using antibiotics in feed and water for 

growth promotion and prophylaxis. This increase provides an opportunity to observe how 

antibiotic use in small-scale production operations influences the epidemiology of AMR and 

MGEs in commensal gut bacteria of poultry and humans. A serial cross-sectional community-

based study was conducted to examine how small-scale poultry production practices affect the 

frequency of MGEs and phenotypic AMR in poultry and human isolates across rural 

communities in northern Ecuador.  

  

METHODS 

 

Study area and design 

 

5 

ORIGINAL UNEDITED MANUSCRIPT  

 

The location and overall design of the parent case-control study have been described 

elsewhere (22,23); briefly, the study included 31 total villages distributed along roads and river 

basins near Borbón, a major population hub in northern coastal Ecuador, that were visited 

between 2003 and 2012. This analysis was restricted to data from 20 of these villages where 

fecal samples from both humans and chickens were collected (August 2010 to May 2012). Each 

village was visited for 15-days once a year during this period. Since the study period 

encompassed 20 months, some villages were visited once and others twice. Consent to 

participate was obtained from all households, and all study protocols were reviewed and 

approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board and the Universidad San 

Francisco de Quito Bioethics Committee. 

 

Poultry sample collection 

 

Starting in August 2010, two types of birds were sampled from each village during study 

visits. Birds from small-scale production operations were production-breed broiler chickens and 

laying hens raised in close contact with other birds within poultry coops, and were not allowed or 

able to leave the coop environment. Coop sizes ranged from tens to hundreds of birds (the 

majority housed 50-100). Diets of production birds were largely composed of formula feed 

containing antibiotics, and antibiotics were sometimes directly administered to these chickens in 

their water. Coop-level information on antibiotics included in feed was not available. 

Furthermore, the specific antibiotics used varies by brand, and over time for a given brand. (A 

previous analysis of a commonly available feed for laying and broiler hens in the area revealed 

 

6 

ORIGINAL UNEDITED MANUSCRIPT  

the presence of chloramphenicol, virginiamycin, lincomycin, and tetracycline using mass 

spectrometry (15).) In contrast, household chickens, kept for personal consumption (meat and 

eggs), did not have movement restrictions and had diets composed primarily of ground corn and 

kitchen scraps.  

To obtain poultry cloacal samples, teams visited all households with active small-scale 

production poultry coops, and households with no small-scale production coops that were 

located as far as possible from active coops (one non-production household was sampled for 

each household with an active coop). At least five small-scale production chickens in each coop 

were sampled. For villages with no small-scale production operations present at the time of the 

visit, three to ten households were chosen at random to sample household birds. The exact 

number was dependent on the proportion of households in the village that were raising household 

birds at the time, which ranged from 10-30%.  

 

Human sample collection 

 

As part of the original case-control study, human stool samples were collected from cases 

of diarrhea, identified through daily household visits during the 15-day village visits. The World 

Health Organization case definition of diarrhea was used, which requires three or more loose 

stools (self-reported or, for children < 13 years of age, maternally reported) in a 24-hour period 

(24). A 10% random sample of the community was selected to identify controls, defined as 

individuals without diarrheal symptoms during the prior six days. Humans were linked to birds 

from small-scale production operations or household birds through a shared household 

identification number.

Markers for phenotypic AMR  

 

Isolates of E. coli from each human and chicken fecal sample were selected and grown on 

Chromocult agar (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Phenotypic resistance was measured for up to 

five isolates per chicken and (given the larger number of human samples collected over the entire 

study period) one isolate at random per human using disc-diffusion assays by standard 

antibiogram methods. As the study comparisons were within bird and human groups (see below), 

any bias introduced by this approach should be non-differential. The following classes were 

tested: beta-lactams (ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate acid, cefotaxime, cephalothin), 

quinolones (ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin), aminoglycosides (gentamicin and streptomycin), 

sulfonamides (sulfisoxazole, sulfamethoxazole), trimethoprim (tested with sulfamethoxazole), 

chloramphenicol, and tetracycline. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 

breakpoints were used to determine an isolate’s susceptibility or resistance to antibiotics from a 

clinical perspective (25). An isolate was defined as MDR if the isolate was resistant to two or 

more classes of antibiotics. 

 

Markers for MGEs   

 

To test for the presence of MGEs, genes associated with the following integrons and 

resistance genes were used as markers: class-1 integrons (int1), class-2 integrons (int2), and two 

tetracycline genes (tetA/tetB). Presence or absence of each gene was determined using high-

throughput dot-blot hybridization on the Library-on-a-Slide (LOS) array platform developed

ORIGINAL UNEDITED MANUSCRIPT  

previously in our laboratory (26), with internal gene probes prepared with primers listed in Web 

Table 1. Hybridization conditions and the analysis of the probing results have been described in 

detail elsewhere (26–29).  

 

Statistical analysis 

 

To examine the role of small-scale production operations on the prevalence of AMR in E. 

coli isolates, the AMR prevalence in isolates from small-scale production birds was compared to 

the prevalence in isolates from household birds. To investigate the role that small-scale 

production operations have on the prevalence of AMR isolates from household birds in the 

surrounding community, household birds were stratified by village type (household birds from 

villages with small-scale production operations, and household birds from villages without 

small-scale production operations at the time of sample collection). To investigate how MGEs 

influence AMR levels, another stratified analysis was done stratifying isolates by both small-

scale production and MGE status. AMR prevalence in isolates from humans associated with 

birds from small-scale production operations was compared to the prevalence of AMR in isolates 

from humans associated with only household birds. As with the poultry comparisons above, the 

latter group was also stratified by the presence or absence of a small-scale production operation 

in the village at the time of visit, and by both small-scale production and MGE status.  

Multiple levels of clustering potentially occur for poultry (bird, household, and village 

level) and human (household and village level) isolates. To investigate potential clustering, odds 

ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were generated by building nested mixed  

models with random intercepts for each level of clustering with PROC GLIMMIX in SAS® 

 

9 

ORIGINAL UNEDITED MANUSCRIPT  

Software version 9.4 (Cary, NC). Evidence for clustering was assessed through significance of 

the household and village-level random effect variance. For isolates from both birds and humans, 

there was no evidence for clustering at the village level (i.e. the village-level random effect 

variance was not significantly different from zero). Due to high correlation of isolates within-

birds that manifested in highly variable covariate effect estimates (data not shown), a random 

effect for birds was not used. Instead, isolates were collapsed across birds (i.e., if there was an 

isolate positive for a marker, then that bird was considered positive for that marker) and this 

bird-level observation was used for the models. Therefore, final mixed models for both poultry 

and humans only included a random intercept for household.  

To compare the odds of AMR in isolates from small-scale production birds (and 

associated humans) to those in household birds (and associated humans), the above models were 

used to calculate unadjusted and adjusted ORs and 95% CIs. To calculate adjusted ORs, we 

controlled for variables based on hypothesized causal relationships between these variables and 

the exposure/outcome. Year of sample collection can influence the presence of a small-scale 

production operation and levels of AMR. Diarrheal case status of humans may be causally linked 

to AMR levels: if a person is sick and takes antibiotics, that may then select for AMR organisms 

(adjusting for a variable that is only causally linked to the outcome can increase statistical 

efficiency (30)). Adjusted models, therefore, included year of sample collection for isolates from 

birds and year of sample collection and original diarrheal case status for isolates from humans. In 

addition to the latter adjusted model for humans (Model 1), because MGEs may be related to 

both small-scale production operations and AMR, we constructed a second adjusted model 

controlling for MGEs (Model 2).

RESULTS 

 

Poultry data 

 

We collected 1,245 isolates from 376 chickens (186 small-scale production birds and 190 

from household birds) in the 20 villages. Higher prevalence of AMR for all markers was seen in 

isolates from small-scale production birds compared to those from household birds (Table 1). 

Unadjusted and adjusted ORs from mixed models showed significantly elevated odds for the 

presence of all MGE markers among small-scale production birds, and significantly elevated 

odds of resistance for 7/12 antibiotics tested (as well as MDR) compared to household birds 

(Table 2). (Low prevalence of resistance was observed for amoxicillin/clavulanate acid, 

cephalothin, cefotaxime, enrofloxacin, and gentamicin, particularly among isolates from 

household birds; therefore, models for these antibiotics gave unstable ORs and are not reported). 

To investigate the role of small-scale production operations on household chickens, 

household birds were stratified by the presence of a small-scale production operation in the 

village (n=68) or without a small-scale production operation present in the village (n=122) at the 

time of visit (Table 3). Household chickens from villages with small-scale production operations 

had significantly higher odds of resistance to two of the four MGE markers (adjusted OR [95% 

CI] for int1 and tetA: 3.1 [1.27, 7.69] and 2.6 [1.20, 5.66], respectively) compared to household 

chickens from non-production villages. In addition, higher odds of phenotypic resistance were 

observed for MDR (adjusted OR [95% CI]: 2.4 [1.07, 5.40]) and for two antibiotics (adjusted OR 

 

11 

ORIGINAL UNEDITED MANUSCRIPT  

[95% CI] for sulfisoxazole and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: 3.3 [1.35, 8.02] and 3.3 [1.35, 

7.99], respectively).  

 

Human data 

 

Human isolates (n=799) were linked in the database to small-scale production operation 

or household birds through a shared household identification number. There were 45 humans 

associated with production birds and 754 associated with household birds. The prevalence of 

AMR to 8/12 antibiotics and 4/4 MGE markers was higher for isolates from humans associated 

with production birds compared to those associated with household birds (Table 1). ORs from 

nested mixed models are shown in Table 4. As with the poultry data, there was low AMR 

prevalence for a subset of antibiotics and these models are not reported. There was also low 

prevalence of int2 and tetB; these were combined with int1 and tetA for a single integron and 

tetracycline gene category (Table 4). Adjusted models show increased odds of the presence of an 

integron (adjusted OR [95% CI]: 2.0 [1.06, 3.83]), sulfisoxazole resistance (adjusted OR [95% 

CI]: 1.9 [1.01, 3.60]), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistance (adjusted OR [95% CI]: 2.1 

[1.13, 3.95]) among humans associated with small-scale production birds compared to humans 

associated with household birds. Similar patterns were observed upon stratifying humans 

associated with household birds by village type (Table 5), with higher odds of tetA/B becoming 

significant when comparing humans associated with small-scale production birds to humans 

associated from household birds in non-production villages (adjusted Model 1 OR [95% CI]: 2.0 

[1.02, 3.78]. Only tetracycline resistance (adjusted Model 1 OR [95% CI]: 1.5 [1.03, 2.08]) had 

 

12 

ORIGINAL UNEDITED MANUSCRIPT  

significantly elevated odds when comparing humans associated with household birds in small-

scale production villages to those in non-production villages. 

 

  

Small-scale production operations, AMR, and MGEs 

 

 

Elevated levels of markers for MGEs, particularly isolates positive for int1 and tetA, were 

consistently observed in small-scale production birds and associated humans compared to 

household birds and associated humans. To explore how MGEs may facilitate AMR in isolates 

from poultry and humans, the prevalence of phenotypic AMR by small-scale production 

exposure was further stratified by the presence or absence of MGEs (results for int1 are shown in 

Figure 1). Three distinct groups of phenotypic AMR emerged when using all isolates from 

poultry, which we refer to here as Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3. Resistance to Group 1 

antibiotics (sulfisoxazole, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline) had the highest 

levels of resistance whenever an integron was present, regardless of poultry type (Figure 1A). In 

Group 2 (Figure 1B), both the presence of small-scale production operations and int1 increased 

the prevalence of AMR. Resistance to Group 3 antibiotics was high with production exposure, 

but sometimes both production and integron exposures were required (Figure 1C). Similar 

grouping patterns were also seen when stratifying by int2, tetA, and tetB (data not shown). In 

humans, there were low frequencies of resistance to Group 2 and 3 antibiotics, and so similar 

patterns failed to emerge for these groups (data not shown). However, the prevalence of AMR 

for sulfisoxazole, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline (Group 1) in human isolates 

showed similar patterns to those seen in poultry isolates, with the highest AMR prevalence (~70-

80%) occurring when MGEs were present, intermediary prevalence (35-40%) occurring when 

 

13 

ORIGINAL UNEDITED MANUSCRIPT  

only small-scale production operations were present, and the lowest prevalence (~20%) present 

when neither small-scale production operations or MGEs were present (Figure 1D).  

 

Given our observations that small-scale production operations are associated with 

elevated odds of MGEs (Tables 2-5), and that MGEs are associated with elevated levels of AMR 

(Figure 1), a second adjusted model for humans was created where presence/absence of a MGE 

was added to the model (Table 5, Model 2). Attenuated ORs and a loss of (moderate-to-weak) 

significance for sulfisoxazole, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline for humans 

associated with production birds (and tetracycline for humans associated with household birds in 

production villages) was observed. 

 

DISCUSSION 

 

This study suggests that production operations on a smaller scale, and not just industrial-

scale poultry operations, are associated with increases in resistant isolates in poultry and humans 

associated with these operations. In addition, the MGE and phenotypic data presented here 

highlight a potentially important role of small-scale production operations within the study site, 

namely an elevated occurrence of MGEs in E. coli carried by production birds and associated 

humans. Integrons house a wide array of resistance genes (20), which can result in the expression 

of resistant phenotypes not directly related to antibiotics used in production farming. In a study 

of livestock farms with heavy use of antibiotics, all types of resistance genes were enriched, and 

such enrichment was highly correlated with the abundance of MGEs such as transposases (31), 

often linked with integrons (32).  

 

14 

ORIGINAL UNEDITED MANUSCRIPT  

The ability of class-1 integrons to carry AMR genes is the most likely explanation for our 

observed relationship between int1, small-scale production operations, and AMR (Figure 1). For 

Group 1 antibiotics (sulfisoxazole, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline), the 

presence of int1 was associated with an AMR prevalence of ~90% from bacterial isolates taken 

from birds, regardless of poultry type. This finding can be explained by physical links to MGEs. 

All class-1 integrons incorporate a sulfonamide (sul) resistance gene as part of their structure, 

and often carry dihydrofolate reductase (dfr) genes (conveying resistance to trimethoprim) (33). 

In addition, tetracycline resistance genes are often found on the same conjugative plasmids as 

integrons (34,35).   

In contrast to Group 1, for Group 2 antibiotics, the presence of int1 contributed to some 

increases of resistance in isolates from poultry, while additional exposure to small-scale 

production operations resulted in even higher resistance levels. This finding is plausible because, 

while genes conferring resistance to the Group 2 antibiotics have been found on class-1 

integrons, some are less common than the sul and dfr genes (33). For Group 3 antibiotics, 

exposures to small-scale production operations or int1 genes alone tended to result in minor 

increases in resistance. Only when both small-scale production operations and integrons were 

present did we observe high levels of resistance, suggesting that even antibiotics with overall low 

AMR levels in a community can achieve higher levels given the presence of both these 

exposures. 

The selection of MGEs due to small-scale production operations may be an evolutionary 

response to exposure to a large variety of antibiotics. In this study site, various types of 

antibiotics were detected in feed used in production coops (15). Such broad-scale antibiotic use 

in this setting may select bacterial isolates in birds carrying MGEs, which in turn may influence 

 

15 

ORIGINAL UNEDITED MANUSCRIPT  

AMR in bacterial isolates from humans. This agrees with recent evidence showing that 

transmission of AMR from animals to humans may be driven more by MGEs than cross-

colonization by resistant strains (21). The higher prevalence of tetA and tetB genes in isolates 

from small-scale production birds could also be explained by antibiotic use, as tetracycline has 

been previously detected in feed used in small-scale production operations in this area (15). 

E.coli isolates from humans associated with small-scale production birds had higher 

levels of MGEs and phenotypic AMR than those from humans associated with household birds, 

particularly those linked to MGEs from Figure 1 (sulfisoxazole and 

trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) (Table 4, Table 5). The lack of significant differences for other 

markers may be due to the small number of samples from humans associated with production 

birds (n=45). After adjusting for the presence of MGEs, the relationships between small-scale 

production operations and phenotypic resistance were attenuated, indicating overlap in the 

variance in the outcome (AMR) explained by presence of MGEs and these operations. One 

plausible explanation for this overlap is that small-scale production operations increase the 

prevalence of isolates containing MGEs, which in turn increases prevalence of AMR isolates. 

Isolates from household birds in small-scale production villages had significantly higher 

odds of resistance than samples from those in non-production villages for int1, tetA, 

sulfisoxazole, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and MDR (Table 3). In addition, humans 

associated with household birds in small-scale production villages had elevated odds of 

tetracycline resistance (Table 5). Together, these results are indirect evidence of environmental 

spread of AMR at the community-level from small-scale production operations, possibly through 

soil, air, water, or meat.  

 

16 

ORIGINAL UNEDITED MANUSCRIPT  

A small number of studies have studied AMR patterns in chickens and/or humans 

associated with small-scale production operations in developing countries (14–16).  We add a 

new perspective by sampling E. coli isolates from three groups of birds (small-scale production 

birds and household birds residing in small-scale production and non-production villages) and 

from corresponding human from the community rather than clinics. In this region of Ecuador, 

high levels of AMR in isolates from these groups were observed despite the small-scale nature of 

the operations, suggesting that high levels of AMR may be found in small-scale production 

operations elsewhere in the developing world. Given the growing interest in utilizing poultry as a 

tool for economic development (36–38), the results presented here are important when 

considering policy implications, especially in nations that have not yet enacted or enforced 

regulations on non-therapeutic antibiotic use.

Abbreviations: AM, ampicillin; CI, confidence interval; G, sulfisoxazole; int1/2, class-1 or class-2 integron; MDR, multi-drug resistance (resistant to two or more antibiotic 
classes); OR, odds ratio; S, streptomycin; STX, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole; TE, tetracycline; tetA/B, tetracycline class A or class B. 
a Mixed models accounting for clustering at the household level. Reference group is humans associated with household birds in villages without small-scale production 
operations. Models for 7/12 antibiotics not shown due to low frequencies.  
b Adjusted model 1 includes year of sample collection and diarrheal case status 
c Adjusted model 2 includes year of sample collection, diarrheal case status, and presence of an integron (the model for tetracycline includes presence of tetA/tetB).

Figure 1.  Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in E. coli isolates from small-scale production 

and household birds in rural Ecuador (2010-2012), stratified by the presence or absence of class-

1 integrons. A) For poultry isolates in Group 1, the association of small-scale production 

operations appears to be largely driven by the presence or absence of class-1 integrons. B) For 

poultry isolates in Group 2, the association of small-scale production operations and class-1 

integrons are roughly additive. C) For poultry isolates in Group 3, while small-scale production 

operations result in high resistance levels, both class-1 integrons and small-scale production 

operation exposures are often needed to reach high levels of resistance. D) Resistance patterns in 

isolates from humans associated with small-scale production or household birds for Group 1 

antibiotics mirror those seen in isolates from poultry in A). White: household birds, int1-

negative; light gray: household birds, int1-positive); dark gray: small-scale production birds, 

int1-negative; black: small-scale production birds, int1-positive.
