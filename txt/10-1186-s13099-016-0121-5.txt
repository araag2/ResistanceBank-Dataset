Abstract 
Background:  Thermophilic Campylobacter species are a major cause of bacterial foodborne diarrhoea in humans 
worldwide. Poultry and their products are the predominant source for human campylobacteriosis. Resistance of 
Campylobacter to antibiotics is increasing worldwide, but little is known about the antibiotic resistance in Campy-
lobacter isolated from chicken in Kenya. In this study, 35 suspected Campylobacter strains isolated from faeces and 
cloacal swabs of chicken were tested for their susceptibility to seven antibiotics using a broth microdilution assay and 
molecular biological investigations.
Results:  Overall, DNA of thermophilic Campylobacter was identified in 53 samples by PCR (34 C. jejuni, 18 C. coli and 
one mix of both species) but only 35 Campylobacter isolates (31 C. jejuni and 4 C. coli) could be re‑cultivated after 
transportation to Germany. Isolates were tested for their susceptibility to antibiotics using a broth microdilution assay. 
Additionally, molecular biological detection of antibiotic resistance genes was carried out. C. jejuni isolates showed a 
high rate of resistance to nalidixic acid, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin of 77.4, 71.0 and 71.0 %, respectively. Low resist‑
ance (25.8 %) was detected for gentamicin and chloramphenicol. Multidrug resistance in C. jejuni could be detected 
in 19 (61.3 %) isolates. Resistance pattern of C. coli isolates was comparable. Resistance to ciprofloxacin was confirmed 
by MAMA–PCR and PCR–RFLP in all phenotypically resistant isolates. The tet(O) gene was detected only in 54.5 % of 
tetracycline resistant C. jejuni isolates. The tet(A) gene, which is also responsible for tetracycline resistance, was found 
in 90.3 % of C. jejuni and in all C. coli isolates. Thirteen phenotypically erythromycin‑resistant isolates could not be char‑
acterised by using PCR–RFLP and MAMA–PCR.
Conclusions:  To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first report about resistance to antibiotics in thermo‑
philic Campylobacter originating from chicken in Kenya. Campylobacter spp. show a high level of resistance to cipro‑
floxacin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline but also a remarkable one to chloramphenicol and gentamicin and they are 
multidrug resistant. Resistance to antibiotics is a global public health concern. In Kenya, resistance surveillance needs 
further attention in the future. Efforts to establish at least a National Laboratory with facilities for performing pheno‑
typic and genotypic characterization of thermophilic Campylobacter is highly recommended.

humans  worldwide  [1].  Campylobacteriosis  exceed  the 
total  number  of  those  caused  by  Salmonella,  Shigella, 
and  Escherichia  coli  O157:H7  in  humans,  recently  [2]. 
Campylobacter  infections  are  normally  self-limiting  in 
adults but can cause diarrhoea or even mortality in chil-
dren in developing as well as in developed countries [3, 
4].

A  study  from  western  Kenya  showed  that  20  %  of 
patients with diarrhoea were infected by Campylobacter 
but in the group of children below 5 years Campylobacter 
was represented with 42 % [5].

Commercial  poultry  and  free-living  birds  are  natural 
reservoirs of thermophilic campylobacters. The organism 
has been isolated from numerous bird species, including 
Columbiformes and domestic and free-living Galliformes 
and Anseriformes. C. jejuni has been found in all areas of 
commercial poultry production [6, 7]. Prevalence rates in 
poultry,  especially  in  slaughter-age  broiler  flocks,  could 
reach 100 % on some farms. Although, Campylobacter is 
insignificant for poultry health, it is a predominant cause 
of  foodborne  gastroenteritis  in  humans  worldwide,  and 
contaminated  poultry  meat  is  recognized  as  the  main 
source of human infections [7, 8]. In general, the knowl-
edge about Campylobacter in Kenya is limited. Most of 
the published reports describe prevalence and antibiotic 
resistance in Campylobacter of human origin [4, 9–11]. 
Other  reports  gave  information  about  Campylobacter 
as  cause  of  foodborne  diseases  [12]  and  contamination 
of raw chicken and beef from butcheries and markets in 
Nairobi [13]. Information on thermophilic Campylobac-
ter of animal origin from Kenya is lacking.

Resistance  against  antibiotics  in  bacteria  is  of  public 
health concern. Most commonly used drugs in treatment 
of campylobacteriosis in humans are erythromycin, fluo-
roquinolones or tetracycline [14]. Although, this antimi-
crobial  treatment  is  usually  not  necessary,  however  the 
misuse of antibiotics is widespread in Kenya [5]. Atten-
tion on resistance of Campylobacter is raising and warn-
ing has been launched not to misuse antibiotics such as 
macrolides,  fluoroquinolones  or  alternative  drugs  [15]. 
Kenyan Campylobacter isolates from humans showed a 
high resistance rate against erythromycin (52 %), but only 
low resistance to ciprofloxacin, tetracycline and nalidixic 
acid with 6, 18 and 26 % in the past, respectively [5].

Clinical  breakpoints  of  Campylobacter  susceptibility 
based  on  epidemiological  cut-off  (ECOFF)  values  were 
recommended. EUCAST MIC distributions incorporate 
human and veterinary clinical data from several sources 
worldwide  [16].  The  method  of  choice  for  testing  anti-
biotic  susceptibility  and  determination  of  minimum 
inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of Campylobacter 
isolates is the broth microdilution assay [17, 18].

In addition to phenotypical determination of antibiotic 
resistance,  genetic  analysis  of  resistance  determinants 
in Campylobacter can be carried out. A replacement of 
threonine by isoleucine at amino acid 86 in the gyrA gene 
[19, 20] and a mutation at position 2074 and 2075 on the 
23S rRNA gene are the main mechanisms for fluoroqui-
nolone  and  erythromycin  resistance,  respectively  [21]. 
Presence of tet(O) and/or tet(A) genes is responsible for 

tetracycline  resistance  [22].  A  mismatch  amplification 
mutation assay (MAMA–PCR) can be used for detection 
of the mutations in gyrA and 23S rRNA genes in C. coli 
and C. jejuni responsible for ciprofloxacin and erythro-
mycin  resistance,  respectively  [21,  23].  PCR-restriction 
fragment  length  polymorphism  (PCR–RFLP)  technique 
[24] is available for detection of erythromycin resistance 
as well as specific PCR assays for tet(O) and tet(A) genes. 
These  methods  allow  the  investigation  of  antibiotic 
resistance of Campylobacter even in samples from which 
no Campylobacter could be isolated.

To the best of our knowledge there is no report availa-
ble about antibiotic resistance of thermophilic Campylo-
bacter species isolated from chicken in Kenya. MICs and 
results  of  molecular  assays  on  the  resistance  of  recent 
Kenyan C. coli and C. jejuni are presented.

Methods
Sample collection and Campylobacter isolation
In  total,  35  geographically  different  native  breed  layer 
flocks were sampled. The chickens were housed in back-
yards  and  homesteads  of  small  scale  farmers  from  the 
outskirts of Thika, a town 40 km northeastern of Nairobi, 
Kenya.  Farmers  kept  between  10  and  1000  layers.  The 
birds were fed on commercially formulated ration from 
different sources and sometimes supplied with the lefto-
ver  and  residual  food.  All  the  manufactures  used  anti-
biotics as part of the ingredients in the feed. During the 
rearing of these chickens, antibiotics were used for pre-
vention  and  treatment  of  diseases  without  any  instruc-
tions.  Ten  to  30  cloacal  swabs  and  faecal  samples  were 
collected from each flock according to flock size. Campy-
lobacter were isolated in Kenya Medical Research Insti-
tute, Nairobi according to the guidelines of ISO 10272-1 
[25].  The  isolates  were  preserved  in  1.5  ml  Eppendorf 
tubes  filled  with  skimmed  milk  medium  for  1-week 
transportation from Kenya to Friedrich–Loeffler-Institut, 
Jena, Germany for further laboratory analysis. Campylo-
bacter  strains  were  re-cultivated  on  both  Mueller–Hin-
ton  agar  and  CCDA  (Oxoid  GmbH,  Wesel,  Germany) 
under microaerophilic conditions (5 % O2, 10 % CO2, and 
85 % N2) at 37 °C for 48–72 h.

DNA extraction
Pure  PCR  Template  Preparation  Kit™  (Roche  Diag-
DNA from viable bacteria was extracted using the High 
nostics,  Mannheim,  Germany)  according  to  the  man-
ufacturer’s 
instructions.  Skimmed  milk  samples  of 
Campylobacter  that  could  not  be  re-cultivated  were 
treated with phenol–chloroform to extract DNA. Briefly, 
500 µl of skimmed milk medium was boiled for 5 min. 
After cooling the liquid was mixed with 500 µl buffer-sat-
urated  phenol  (Carl  Roth  GmbH,  Karlsruhe,  Germany)

and  centrifuged  for  5  min.  at  13,400  rpm  (miniSpin, 
Eppendorf,  Hamburg,  Germany).  500  µl  chloroform/
isoamyl alcohol (24:1 vol/vol) was added to the aqueous 
phase, mixed and centrifuged for 5 min. at 13,400 rpm. 
DNA from the aqueous phase was precipitated by mix-
ing  with  0.6  volume  of  isopropanol  at  room  tempera-
ture. After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded 
and the DNA was air dried and finally dissolved in 50 µl 
10 mM Tris (Carl Roth GmbH).

Multiplex PCR for identification of Campylobacter species
A  mPCR  assay  was  used  to  identify  thermophilic 
Campylobacter species (C. jejuni, C. coli, and C. lari) as 
described by El-Adawy et al. [26]. Briefly, the PCR was 
performed in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 5.0 μl 
of  10  ×  Taq  reaction  buffer  complete  (Jena  Bioscience 
GmbH,  Jena,  Germany),  2.0  μl  of  dNTP  mix  (2  mM 
each;  Carl  Roth  GmbH),  2.0  μl  of  each  primer  (Jena 
Bioscience  GmbH),  and  0.2  μl  of  Taq  Pol  thermostable 
DNA  polymerase  (Jena  Bioscience  GmbH).  Amplifica-
tion reactions were carried out in a TRIO Thermoblock 
cycler  (Biometra,  Göttingen,  Germany)  using  the  fol-
lowing  programme:  one  cycle  of  1  min  at  96  °C  was 
followed  by  35  cycles  each  consisting  of  60  s  at  95  °C 
of denaturation, 90 s at 59 °C of annealing, and 60 s at 
72 °C of elongation. The PCR was terminated after a final 
extension  step  of  5  min.  at  72  °C.  Amplification  gener-
ated  857,  589,  522,  and  462  base  pair  DNA  fragments 
specific for the genus Campylobacter and the species C. 
jejuni, C. lari, and C. coli, respectively. For analysis, 20 μl 
of PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in a 
1.5 % agarose gel for 1 h, stained with ethidium bromide 
(0.5 μg/ml), and visualized under UV light. Results were 
documented  using  BioImage  system  GeneGenius  (Syn-
gene, Synoptics Ltd., Cambridge, UK). Reference strains 
C. jejuni DSM 4688, C. coli DSM 4689, and C. lari DSM 
11375 (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und 
Zellkulturen GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) were used 
as positive controls.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and determination 
of MICs
The  antimicrobial  susceptibility  of  C.  jejuni  and  C.  coli 
isolates was tested against seven antibiotic agents (chlo-
ramphenicol,  erythromycin,  ciprofloxacin,  nalidixic 
the  Sensititre™  Campylobacter  plates—EUCAMP  (Trek 
acid,  gentamicin,  streptomycin,  and  tetracycline)  using 
Diagnostic Systems Ltd., East Grinstead, UK). The MIC 
values were detected using different concentration ranges 
as previously described [23]. Briefly, Campylobacter iso-
lates  grown  on  Mueller–Hinton  agar  (Oxoid  GmbH) 
supplemented  with  10  %  bovine  blood  under  micro-
aerophilic  conditions  were  suspended  in  NaCl  solution 

(0.9 %) to obtain a turbidity corresponding to a McFar-
land  standard  of  0.5  (Dr.  Lange,  CADAS  photometer 
30,  Berlin,  Germany).  One-hundred  and  fifty  milliliters 
of the above suspension were diluted with 10 ml Muel-
ler–Hinton broth (Oxoid GmbH) resulting in a concen-
tration  of  approximately  106–107  colony  forming  units 
(cfu)/ml.  One  hundred  milliliters  of  the  inoculum  was 
filled  in  each  well  of  the  plate;  the  plates  were  sealed 
and  incubated  at  37  °C  for  24  h  under  microaerophilic 
conditions.  Results  were  read  either  visually  or  pho-
tometrically  (Tecan  Deutschland  GmbH,  Crailsheim, 
Germany)  using  the  computer  program  easyWIN  fit-
ting (version V6.1, 2000). C. jejuni DSM 4688 and C. coli 
DSM 4689 (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen 
und Zellkulturen GmbH) were included in each batch of 
broth microdilution assay for quality control. The lowest 
concentration of antibiotics that prevents visible growth 
of the microorganism is defined as the MIC.

Molecular biological detection of antibiotic resistance 
determinants
Extracted  Campylobacter  DNA  from  all  samples  and 
strains was used for molecular biological determination 
of selected antibiotic resistance determinants by PCR.

Erythromycin resistance
Detection  of  mutations  at  positions  2074  and  2075  in 
domain V of the 23S rRNA gene, which mediates resist-
ance to erythromycin, was carried out by MAMA–PCR 
and PCR–RFLP as described previously [21, 24]. Genes 
responsible  for  resistance  of  erythromycin  and  cipro-
floxacin were tested at two loci using MAMA–PCR and 
PCR–RFLP.  Primers  and  their  sequences  are  given  in 
Table 1.

Ciprofloxacin resistance
A  single  point  mutation  (Thr-86-Ile)  in  the  quinolone 
resistance-determining  region  (QRDR)  of  gyrA  gene 
was defined as source of high-level resistance to fluoro-
quinolones [23]. MAMA–PCR for C. jejuni isolates was 
carried out as described previously [27], for C. coli a pro-
cedure according to Zirnstein et al. [28] was used. Primer 
details are given in Table 1.

Tetracycline resistance
Primers DMT1 and DMT2 (Jena Bioscience GmbH) were 
used for the detection of the tet(O) gene which is strongly 
associated with tetracycline resistance in C. jejuni and C. 
coli as described previously [29]. As a second gene locus 
associated  with  tetracycline  resistance  the  presence  of 
tet(A) was examined by a previously described PCR assay 
[22].  An  alternative,  in-house  validated  PCR  assay  was 
created  based  on  tet(A)  sequences  (GenBank  acc.  no.

JX891463  and  JX891464)).  Briefly,  primers  tet-A-1  and 
tet-A-2 (Table 1; Jena Bioscience GmbH) were used with 
the following PCR programme: An initial denaturation at 
96 °C for 60 s was followed by 35 cycles of denaturation 
(96 °C for 15 s), annealing (49 °C for 60 s) and extension 
(72 °C for 30 s). PCR was terminated by final extension at 
72 °C for 60 s. The PCR resulted in a 486 bp product.

All PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 
1.5 % agarose gels, staining with ethidium bromide and 
visualization under UV light.

DNA sequencing
PCR products obtained by tet(A) PCRs were sequenced 
by cycle sequencing with BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle 
Sequencing  Kit  (Applied  Biosystems,  Darmstadt,  Ger-
many) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. 
In addition to the amplification primers of the Tet(A)-F/R 
fragment tet-A-A (5’-AAT TTT CTT CAA ATA AGG-3’) 
and tet-A-B (5’-GTC ATT CTT ATA TTA AGT GG-3’) 
were used as sequencing primers. Sequencing products 
were analyzed with an ABI PRISM 3130 genetic analyzer.

MALDI‑TOF mass spectrometry
Cultured  bacteria  were  suspended  in  300  µl  of  bi-dis-
tilled water and mixed with 900 ml of ethanol (Carl Roth 
GmbH). Further treatment of samples and measurement 
were described by El-Ashker et al. [30].

transportation to Germany only 40 of these isolates could 
be re-cultivated. Four C. coli and 31 C. jejuni were identi-
fied by mPCR (Table 2). Five other isolates were identi-
fied by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as members of 
genera Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Ochrobactrum as well as 
two Bordetella isolates.

Eighteen skimmed milk tubes contained Campylobac-
ter DNA [14 C. coli, 3 C. jejuni and one sample harboured 
both C. coli and C. jejuni (Table 2)].

Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and multidrug 
resistance
The  results  of  antimicrobial  susceptibility  testing  of  C. 
jejuni  and  C.  coli  isolates  and  the  rate  of  resistance  to 
seven  antimicrobial  agents  are  given  in  Tables  3  and  4, 
respectively. The C. jejuni isolates showed a high rate of 
resistance to nalidixic acid, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin 
with 77.4, 71.0 and 71.0 %, respectively. Low resistance 
rates were detected for gentamicin and chloramphenicol, 
both with 25.8 % of the isolates. For the low number of C. 
coli isolates (n = 4) a similar pattern was observed. Only 
two  isolates  were  susceptible  to  all  tested  antimicrobial 
agents, one isolate was resistant to all tested antibiotics.

The multidrug resistance profiles of 31 C. jejuni isolates 
are  shown  in  Table  5.  Multidrug  resistance  to  three  or 
more classes of antibiotics was found in 19 isolates (61.3 %) 
and was observed in a range between 5.3 and 26.3 %.

(MAMA–PCR)  was  used  to  characterize  a  gyrA  gene 
mutation associated with ciprofloxacin resistance as well 
as mutations in 23S rRNA genes as cause of erythromycin 
resistance.  The  molecular  biological  detection  of  resist-
ance to ciprofloxacin in both C. coli and C. jejuni was also 
confirmed by change of amino acid 86 from threonine to 
isoleucine in the gyrA gene. Additional to the ciprofloxa-
cin  resistant  Campylobacter  isolates  (Tables  3,  4),  three 

Campylobacter DNAs were detected harbouring the gyrA 
gene mutation. The results were confirmed by PCR–RFLP 
according  to  Vacher  et  al.  [24].  Mutations  at  positions 
2074 and 2075 of the 23S rRNA genes in 13 phenotypi-
cally  erythromycin-resistant  isolates  could  neither  be 
detected by using PCR–RFLP nor MAMA–PCR.

The tet(O) gene which is mainly responsible for tetra-
cycline-resistance was detected by PCR in 12 out of 22 
resistant C. jejuni isolates (54.5 %) and in all tetracycline 
resistant C. coli isolates. tet(O) gene was not detected in 
DNA  extracted  from  the  non-growing  samples.  Addi-
tionally, a newly developed PCR assay was used for the 
detection  of  the  tet(A)  gene.  tet(A)  was  detected  in  28 
out of 31 C. jejuni (90.3 %) and in all 4 C. coli isolates. 
In  3  out  of  14  non-growing  samples  which  harboured 
C.  coli  DNA,  tet(A)  gene  could  be  found  as  well  as  in 
the  one  sample  where  both  C.  jejuni  and  C.  coli  were 
detected.

Discussion
The  antimicrobial  susceptibility  patterns  among  Campy-
lobacter  isolates  originating  from  chicken  in  Kenya  were 
analyzed according to the guidelines of CLSI for Enterobac-
teriaceae which had been guided by previous reports [17, 
31–34]. Clinical breakpoints for interpretation of MIC val-
ues of C. jejuni and C. coli from chicken are available [31, 
35]. In this study a commercially available broth microdilu-
tion assay was used for the determination of MIC values for 
seven antibiotics. The assay already proved to be suitable in 
previous investigations [21, 27, 34, 36, 37].

In this study, only 40 out of 58 suspected Campylobac-
ter  samples  could  be  re-cultivated.  The  storage  condi-
tions  (temperature,  microaerophilic  atmosphere)  using 
skimmed milk medium were possibly not ideal. However, 
it had been demonstrated that C. jejuni can survive up to 
14 days at 1 °C or 2.5 days at 20 °C in sterile skimmed milk 
[38,  39].  Alternative  storage  of  Campylobacter  cultures 
using transport medium (for example Amies medium) or 
cryovials is recommended for future investigations.

In 53 out of 58 collected samples, Campylobacter DNA 
was identified by mPCR assay [26]. The majority of the 
cultures proved to be C. jejuni (88.6 %) which is in agree-
ment with previous studies in chicken [6, 7]. In 18 DNA 
extracts of non-viable samples, 3 C. jejuni (16.7 %), one 
mixed population of C. jejuni/C. coli and 14 C. coli were 
identified. These findings are in agreement with those of 
a previous study that found a longer viability of C. jejuni 
in comparison to C. coli in biological milieu [40]. It may 
be possible that some C. coli isolates had been lost dur-
ing the shipment period. In summary, C. jejuni was iden-
tified  much  more  often  than  C.  coli  (64.2  %)  by  mPCR 
investigation. In agreement with other studies, the find-
ings  highlighted  the  usefulness  of  mPCR  as  a  reliable, 

sensitive, time and cost saving method for identification 
of thermophilic Campylobacter [26].

The  antibiotic  susceptibility  of  35  Campylobacter  iso-
lates  from  Kenyan  chicken  was  investigated  using  Euro-
pean  Committee  on  Antimicrobial  Susceptibility  Testing 
and  epidemiological  cut-off  values  (EUCAST–ECOFFS) 
[16]. A broth microdilution assay was used as a standard-
ized,  easy,  and  reliable  method  for  the  determination  of 
MIC of seven antibiotics [17, 31–34]. High resistance rates 
were obtained for ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid and tetracy-
cline with more than 70 % which is in agreement with a 
recent European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) report [41]. 
These results are in contrast to those of Brooks et al. [5] 
who  reported  resistance  rates  for  Campylobacter  recov-
ered from humans with diarrhoea in Western Kenya for 
ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline with 6, 26 and 
18 % in 2006, respectively. The general high rates of resist-
ance in the chicken isolates may be caused by availability 
and uncontrolled use of antibiotics by small farmers [42].

Resistance  to  chloramphenicol  is  remarkable  with 
25.8  %  in  this  investigation.  Use  of  chloramphenicol 
is  banned  in  animal  breeding  in  Europe  for  more  than 
20  years,  but  still  it  is  often  used  in  many  third  world 
countries  [43].  It  is  easy  to  obtain  antibiotics  over-the-
counter  and  other  unregulated  venues  and  injudicious 
use  promotes  the  development  of  resistance  to  antimi-
crobial  agents.  Resistance  to  gentamicin  in  the  isolates 
obtained from chicken was low in this study (25.8 %), but 
Campylobacter  isolated  from  broilers  and  turkeys  were 
totally susceptible to gentamicin [37, 41, 44, 45]. Erythro-
mycin resistance rates found in this study correspond to 
those of similar studies elsewhere [41, 44, 45].

Multidrug  resistance  was  detected  in  61.3  %  of  the 
Campylobacter  isolates.  Eleven  different  combinations 
were found (Table 5). Frequent, resistance to ciprofloxa-
cin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline was identified (17 out 
of 19 multidrug resistant isolates) which is in agreement 
with  previous  investigation  using  Vietnamese  Campy-
lobacter isolates [45]. However, EFSA [41] reported low 
level of multidrug resistance in C. jejuni from broilers of 
the member states of the EU.

The emerging of antibiotic resistance has been attrib-
uted to the overuse and misuse of antimicrobial agents 
in both the developed and developing world. Antibiotics 
are widely used as growth supplements in livestock and 
to  prevent  infections  [46].  The  emerging  of  multidrug 
resistance may reflect acquisition of different resistance 
determinants on the same DNA molecule or single deter-
minants,  such  as  multidrug  pumps,  that  specify  efflux 
activity  against  different  antimicrobial  agents  [47].  The 
mechanisms of genetic resistance might be chromosomal 
or plasmid-borne, and represent a combination of endog-
enous  and  acquired  genes.  In  general,  mechanisms  of

antibiotic resistance as modification of the antibiotic by 
aminoglycoside-modifying  enzymes  (AphA,  AadE,  Sat), 
enzymatic  inactivation  of  the  antibiotic  by  β-lactamase 
and  modification  of  the  DNA  gyrase  target,  mutations 
in  23S  rRNA  genes  were  included  for  aminoglycosides, 
beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, macrolides and tetracy-
clines, respectively [48, 49]. The multidrug efflux pump 
CmeABC  has  been  involved  in  the  resistance  mecha-
nisms of C. jejuni and C. coli to tetracyclines, fluoroqui-
nolones, macrolides and beta-lactams [49].

Molecular biological methods were used for detection 
of  antibiotic  resistance  determinants  either  using  DNA 
isolated  from  cultures  or  that  of  non-cultured  bacteria 
[27, 37]. All isolates of this study which were resistant to 
ciprofloxacin carried a mutation of the amino acid 86 of 
the gyrA resulting in a change from threonine to isole-
ucine. This mutation was detected also in 3 DNA sam-
ples  extracted  from  skimmed  milk.  The  MAMA–PCR 
protocol allowed the detection of the gyrA mutation and 
PCR–RFLP was confirming the mutation from (ACA to 
ATA) of amino acid 86. This result was in agreement with 
previous reports showing that both methods are simple, 
reliable, rapid tools that can be used as screening meth-
ods  [27,  37].  In  Campylobacter,  resistance  to  erythro-
mycin is chromosomally encoded by an alteration of the 
23S rRNA gene. High level resistance to erythromycin is 
caused by mutations at position 2074 and/or 2075 of the 
domain V of this gene. In this study the mutations were 
neither detected by MAMA–PCR nor by PCR–RFLP.

The tet(O) gene is known to be responsible for tetra-
cycline resistance in Campylobacter isolates [29]. In this 
study,  only  54.5  %  of  the  tetracycline  resistant  isolates 
harboured the tet(O) gene. The tet(A) gene also plays role 
in resistance to tetracycline [22]. The efflux gene tet(A) 
is coding for an approximately 46 kDa membrane-bound 
efflux  protein  for  membrane-associated  proteins  and  is 
involved in the export of tetracycline from the cell [50]. 
In this study, using the recommended primers for tet(A) 
amplification  [18]  PCR  products  of  696  bp  instead  of 
888 bp were obtained. DNA sequencing of amplicons and 
database search resulted in 99.0 % homology to a partial 
putative integral membrane protein and a putative peri-
plasmic protein. Hence, a new PCR assay based on tet(A) 
gene  sequences  for  C.  jejuni  (acc.  no.  JX891464)  and 
C.  coli  (acc.  no.  JX891463)  was  developed.  Parameters 
such  as  limit  of  detection,  limit  of  quantification,  PCR 
efficiency and specificity were considered during an in-
house validation process. Amplicon length was 486 and 
the  amplicons  were  sequenced  to  confirm  the  identity. 
The tet(A) gene was much more frequently identified in 
the Kenyan Campylobacter isolates than tet(O) (35 vs 13).
To  the  best  of  our  knowledge  this  is  the  first  report 
on  the  status  of  antibiotic  susceptibility  of  thermophilic 

Campylobacter  from  chicken  in  Kenya.  High  level  of 
resistance  to  ciprofloxacin,  erythromycin  and  nalidixic 
acid as well as multidrug resistance was detected previ-
ously in Kenya. In Kenya, this problem is reported to be 
caused  by  the  increasing  rate  of  unregulated  over-the-
counter  sale  without  prescriptions  of  these  antibiotics, 
mainly to humans self-treatment of suspected infections 
and to a lesser extent for use in animals [51]. These find-
ings also demonstrate the potential for antibiotic-resistant 
bacteria to spread through the food chain from animals 
treated  with  antibiotics  for  humans.  Such  misuse  and 
overuse  may  have  resulted  in  the  selection  of  resistant 
mutants or acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes from 
other organisms through the process of genetic exchange.
It is recommendable that a long-term local surveillance 
programme is adopted for monitoring changes in resist-
ance among Campylobacter isolates. Efforts to establish 
at least a National Laboratory with facilities for perform-
ing phenotyping and genotyping methods is highly rec-
ommended.  Emphasis  should  be  given  on  educational 
advertising  to  reduce  the  input  of  antibiotics  in  animal 
breeding to minimize the potential hazard for humans.
