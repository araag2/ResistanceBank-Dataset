The present study was undertaken to assess the inhibitory potential of lactic acid bacteria isolated from 
traditionally  processed  corn-beer  and  palm-wine  on  Escherichia  coli,  Salmonella  typhi  and 
Staphylococcus aureus.  Lactic acid bacteria were isolated on MRS agar using pour plate method. The 
catalase  negative  and  Gram  positive  isolates  were  selected  as  presumptive  lactic  acid  bacteria  and 
were biochemically characterized using the API 50 CHL BioMerieux kit to identify them at species level. 
The  LAB  isolates  were  then  assessed  for  antimicrobial  activity  potentials  against  food-borne 
pathogens.  Thirteen  LAB  isolates  which  constituted  nine  different  species  namely:  Lactobacillus 
fermentum,  Lactobacillus  plantarum,  Lactobacillus  brevis,  Lactobacillus  acidophilus,  Lactobacillus 
bulgaricus,  Leuconostoc  mesenteroides,  Leuconostoc  carnosum,  Pedioccocus  acidilactici  and 
Lactobacillus pentosus were isolated from these two beverages. The entire LAB isolates demonstrated 
great potentials to inhibit the test pathogens. P. acidilactici from corn-beer exhibited the overall highest 
inhibitory  activity  with  zones  of  inhibition  of  19,  20  and  16  mm  on  E.  coli,  S.  typhi  and  S.  aureus, 
respectively; while the isolate from palm-wine, L. pentosus exerted the highest antimicrobial action on 
the  test  pathogens.  It  was  observed  that  most  of  the  LAB  isolates  inhibited  the  indicator  pathogens 
mainly  by bacteriocin  production.  S.  typhi  was  the most  susceptible food-borne bacterial  pathogen  to 
the inhibitory activity of the LAB isolates, followed by E. coli.  
 
Key words: Lactic acid bacteria, food-borne pathogens, antimicrobial activity, probiotics, bacteriocins.  

 
 
INTRODUCTION  
 
The  occurrence  of  foodborne  microbial  pathogens  and 
the increased foodborne toxi-infections  remain  a  critical 
 

issue  in  many  countries  around  the  world  (Newell  et  al., 
2010).  The   development   of  foodborne  diseases  is  a

major  health  problem  in  underdeveloped  and developing 
countries. Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most affected 
regions  (Quilan,  2013).  This  is  associated  with  poverty 
and  poor  hygiene  conditions.  Salmonellosis,  occupy  an 
important place. A recent survey carried out by Nguendo 
(2014)  reveals  that  70%  of  food  borne  illness  cases  in 
Cameroon  is  associated  with  the  consumption  of  street 
foods  sold  in  major  cities  such  as  Douala  and  Yaoundé. 
Methods used for the treatment of these diseases involve 
mainly the use of antibiotics. However, the prolonged use 
of  antibiotics  in  these  regions  has  been  indexed  as  the 
main  cause  of  the  occurrence  of  bacterial  strains  resis-
tant  to  antibiotics.  The  emergence  of  antibiotic  resistant 
strains is a major public health problem (Tatsinkou et al., 
2016).  The  exploitation  of  the  inhibitory  activity  of  the 
lactic bacteria appeared in recent years as an alternative 
treatment  and  even  prevention  of  some  foodborne  toxi-
infection  (Mezaini  et  al.,  2009;  Obi  et  al.,  2015;  Khalid, 
2011).  Indeed  the  lactic  acid  bacteria  are  known  to  be 
non-pathogenic  and  Generally  Regarded  as  Safe,  and 
are  increasingly  used  because  of  their  probiotic  proper-
ties (Zacharof and Lovitt, 2012; Mariam et al., 2014). 

Probiotics  are  microbial  strains  and  administration  in 
adequate  amount  is  beneficial  in  humans  or  animals. 
Many  recent  studies  have  demonstrated  the  potential  of 
LAB  to  inhibit  the  growth  of  food  borne  pathogens  by 
various  mechanisms,  including  the  production  of  antimi-
crobial proteins called bacteriocins (O’Shea et al., 2013). 

The  traditional  processed  corn  and  palm  wines  are 
widely  consumed  in  Africa and particularly  in Cameroon. 
They have recently been described as potential niches of 
lactic  acid  bacteria.  Which  are  partly  involved  in  the 
process  of  fermentation  and  the  flavor  of  these  native 
drinks. To the authors’ knowledge, very few studies have 
been  conducted  on  the  probiotic  potential  of  lactic  acid 
bacteria  strains  isolated  from  traditional  processed  corn 
beer and palm wine; hence, the need to conduct a study 
on  the  probiotic  potential  of  these  strains,  mainly  the 
inhibitory activity against food pathogens. 
 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Study site and sample collection 
 
This  study  was  conducted  in  Fako  Division  of  the  South  West 
Region  of  Cameroon.  The  specimens  were  obtained  from  Buea, 
Limbe, Tiko and Muyuka, these being the four major towns in Fako 
division,  South  west  Region  of  Cameroon.  The  samples  were 
processed  in  the  laboratory  of  the  School  of  Assistant  Laboratory 
Technicians  of  Limbe  and  the  Biotechnology  unit  of  the  University 
of Buea. 

Three  samples  of  each  of  the  two  specimens  (corn-beer  and 
Palm  wine)  were  collected  from  the  four  towns  in  Fako  Division  to 
give  a  sample  size  of  24.  About  50  ml  of  each  fresh  sample  was 
poured  in  sterile  wide-mouth  collection  cups  and  labelled  and  the 
temperature  was  taken  at  the  spot.  Samples  obtained  in  towns 
further  from  Limbe  were  transported  in  cool  packs.  Upon  arrival  at 
the  laboratory,  the  pH  of  each  sample  was  measured  by  using 
calibrated  Universal  Litmus  pH  test  strips (LabRat  Supplies).  Then 
each sample  was  separated  in  two  cups.  All  the  samples  were  

Fossi et al.          1141 

 
 
 
continuously  labelled  as  they  were  being  separated.  The  pH  was 
measured so as to ascertain whether the antimicrobial potentials of 
the  lactic  acid  bacteria  had  any  relationship  with  acidity  of  the 
samples. 
 
 
Media preparation and sample processing 
 
All  media  were  prepared  following  the  manufacturer’s  instruction. 
The media used were  de Man  Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) (Oxoid) 
agar  for  isolation  of  LAB,  MRS  Broth  (Oxoid)  for  the  production  of 
antimicrobials, Nutrient Agar (Liofilchem s.r.i Bacteriology products) 
for  total  microbial  count,  and  Muller  Hinton  Agar  (Oxoid)  for 
antimicrobial  sensitivity  testing.  Aseptic  techniques  were  observed 
throughout  the  media  preparation  process.  A  1:10  dilution  of  each 
sample was made prior to culturing. This was done by diluting 1 ml 
of  the  sample  within  9  ml  of  physiological  saline  (0.85%  NaCl). 
Further,  ten-fold  serial  dilutions  ranging  from  10-1  to  10-5  were 
prepared.  The  10-5  diluted  samples  were  used  for  culture  on  MRS 
Agar and Nutrient agar. 
 
 
Isolation and phenotypic identification of LAB 
 
Samples  for  the  isolation  of  lactic  acid  bacteria  were  cultured  on 
MRS  Agar.  The  pour  plate  method  was  employed;  about  1  ml  of 
each  of  the  10-5  diluted  sample  was  pipette  into  separate  sterile 
plates  and  about  15  ml  of  the  prepared  molten  MRS  agar  was 
poured  on  it.  The  plates  were  then  gently  rotated  clockwise  and 
anti-clockwise so as to allow for a homogeneous distribution of  the 
agar and the diluted sample. The agar was allowed to solidify, then 
inverted and incubated at 30°C for 48 h.  

At  the  end  of  the  incubation  period,  the  MRS  plates  were 
observed  for  colony  formation.  Colonies  which  were  different  from 
each  other  in  their  morphology  and  phenotypic  appearance  were 
picked up using a sterile inoculating loop and were purified on MRS 
Agar by re-streaking on plates until only a single type of colony was 
present. The different pure cultures so obtained were characterized 
for  their  colony  morphology  and  subjected  to  Gram  staining  and 
catalase  test.  Colonies  found  Gram  positive,  non-motile,  rod 
shaped bacteria that demonstrated a catalase negative result were 
selected  as  presumptive  lactic  acid  bacteria.  They  were  then 
preserved  on  MRS  Agar  slants  and  store  at  4°C  for  further 
investigations. 

The identification of lactic acid bacteria at species level was done 
by  biochemical  characterization  using 
the  API  50CH  kit 
(BioMerieux, France). The API 50 CH is a standardized system that 
associates  the  fermentation  of  50  carbohydrates  to  bacteria 
species. It is used for the identification of  Lactobacillus and related 
genera. 

A  positive  test  corresponds  to  the  acidification  revealed  by  the 
bromocresol  purple  indicator  contained  in  the  medium  changing  to 
yellow.  For  the  esculin  test  (tube  no.  25),  a  change  in  colour  from 
purple  to  black  was  interpreted  as  positive  (+).  The  biochemical 
profiles  obtained  for  the  LAB  strains  was  analyzed  using  the  API 
identification software database (API LAB PLUS), Version 5. 
 
 
Determination of antimicrobial activity 
 
Preparation of the sample filtrate 
 
Each presumed LAB isolate was inoculated from slants into 5 ml of 
MRS  broth  and  incubated  at  37°C  for  24  h.  The  culture  broth  of 
each isolate was then centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 10 min. The cell 
free  supernatant  (CFS)  was  then  collected  and  passed  through  a 
0.2µm  sterile  syringe  filter  and  stored  at  -20°C  prior  to  use.  The 
CFS  was  thus   used   for   susceptibility  testing,  determination  of

minimum  inhibition  concentration  (MIC)  and  determination  of  the 
antimicrobial substances. 
 
 
Sources of food-borne pathogens 
 
The  food  borne  bacteria  pathogens  that  were  used  for  this  study 
were  provided  by  the  Laboratory  of  Microbiology  of  the  Buea 
Regional Hospital Annex and Limbe Regional hospitals. They were 
isolated  from  stools  of  patients  with  symptoms  of  food  borne 
diseases  and  characterized  and  identified  by  API  20  A,  20  E,  20 
Staph Kits (BioMerieux, France). We were given pure cultures that 
were store on slant and preserved at 4°C.  
 
 
Susceptibility testing by the agar well diffusion method 
 
The  Agar  well  diffusion  methods  suggested  by  Tagg  and  McGiven 
(1971),  was  modified  and  used  to  test  for  the  antimicrobial  activity 
of  the  presumed  LAB  isolates  against  selected  food  borne 
pathogens. The pure cultures of the selected  foodborne pathogens 
were inoculated from slants to about 5 ml Muller Hinton broths and 
incubated  for  24  h  at  30°C.  About  1%  of  the  24  h  culture  of  the 
pathogen was suspended in 9  ml of normal saline and  adjusted to 
0.5 McFarland standards. A lawn of the indicator strains were then 
made  by  spreading  the  cell  suspension  over  the  surface  of  Muller 
Hinton  agar  plates  with  a  sterile  cotton  swab.  The  plates  were 
allowed to dry and a sterile cork borer of diameter 5 mm was used 
to bore uniform wells in the agar. Each well was then filled with 100 
µl  of  the  different  concentrations  of  the  cell-free  supernatant  (LAB 
culture  filtrate).  After  incubation  at  37°C  for  48  h,  the  plates  were 
observed for a zone of inhibition around the well. The antimicrobial 
activity  was  expressed  as  the  diameter  of  the  inhibition  zones 
around  the  wells.  Results  were  considered  positive  if  the  diameter 
of the zones of inhibition were greater than or equal to 7 mm.  The 
negative  control  used  was  100  µL  of  distilled  water  while  the 
positive  control  used  were  100  µl  of  diluted  Ciprofloxacin  and 
Azithromycin. 
 
 
Determination of minimum inhibition concentration 
 
The  MIC  was  performed  using  the  broth  dilution  method,  by 
following  the  modified  version  of  the  procedure  described  in  the 
BSAC  Guide  to  Sensitivity  Testing  (1991).  In  this  method,  4  to  5 
isolated colonies of the test pathogens were obtained and cultured 
overnight  at  37°C  on  Muller  Hinton  agar.  The  cultures  were 
standardized  using  standard  microbiological  techniques  to  have  a 
concentration  of  very  near  1  million  cells  per  milliliter (106  cfu/mL). 
After  overnight 
the  CFS 
(antimicrobial  substance)  of  LAB  isolates  were  then  diluted  using 
Muller  Hinton  Broth,  beginning  with  1/2  dilution  up  to  1/12  serial 
dilutions.  The  different  test  pathogens  were  then  inoculated  into 
each of the diluted tests tubes to a final density of 5×105 cfu/ml. The 
tubes  were  then  incubated  for  18  h  at  37°C.  After  the  incubation 
time,  the  tubes  were  inspected  for  growth  of  the  test  pathogens. 
Meanwhile,  aliquots  of  growth  control  (with  no  antimicrobial 
substance)  were  plated  to  verify  cfu/ml  counts  of  viable  bacteria. 
These  were  equally  incubated  under  the  same  conditions  and 
colonies  were  counted.  The  MIC  was  recorded  as  the  lowest 
concentration  of  the  antimicrobial  substance  that  prevents  the 
appearance of visible turbidity. 
 
 
Determination of inhibitory substance 
 
The Cell free supernatant (CFS) of each LAB Isolate was prepared 
as stated above. Each sample  filtrate  was  then  separated  into  3  

test  pathogen, 

incubation  of 

the 

 
 
 
 
different  sterile  test  tubes  for  the  determination  of  antimicrobial 
substance  due 
to  bacteriocin,  acid  and  hydrogen  peroxide, 
respectively. The process was as follow: 
 
1.  The  CFS  in  the  first  tube  was  used  to  determine  whether  the 
antimicrobial activity is due to bacteriocin. The CFS in this tube was 
thus  adjusted  to  pH  7.0  by  the  addition  of  sterile  1  N  sodium 
hydroxide (NaOH), to eliminate any effect of acidity; while inhibitory 
activity due to hydrogen peroxide was eliminated by the addition of 
a  catalase  enzyme  (5  mg/dl),  Amplex  Red  Catalase  Assay  Kit 
(A22180). The filtrate was then used for susceptibility studies. 
2. The CFS in the second tube was used to determine whether the 
inhibitory  substance  is  an  acid.  Thus,  catalase  enzyme  (5  mg/dl) 
was  added  to  this  tube  to  eliminate  any  inhibitory  activity  due  to 
hydrogen  peroxide.  The  tube  was  then  heated  in  boiling  water 
(100°C)  to  denature  proteins  and  thus  eliminate  any  inhibitory 
activity due to the presence bacteriocin in the CFS. 
3.  The  CFS  in  the  third  tube  was  used  to  determine  whether  the 
inhibitory  substance  is  hydrogen  peroxide  (H2O2).  Here,  the  CFS 
was  adjusted  to  pH  7.0  by  the  addition  of  sterile  1  N  NaOH  to 
eliminate inhibitory effect due to acid.  

The  catalase  enzyme  (5  mg/dl)  was  added  to  this  tube  to 
eliminate any inhibitory activity due to hydrogen peroxide. The pure 
cultures of the selected food borne pathogens were inoculated from 
slants  to  about  5  ml  MRS  broths  and  incubated  for  24  h  at  30°C. 
About 1% of the 24 h culture of the pathogen was suspended in 9 
mL  of  normal  saline  and  adjusted  to  0.5  McFarland  standards.  A 
lawn  of the indicator strains were then made  by spreading the  cell 
suspension  over  the  surface  of  Muller  Hinton  agar  plates  with  a 
sterile  cotton  swab.  The  plates  were  allowed  to  dry  and  a  sterile 
glass rod of diameter 3 mm was used to  bore  uniform wells in  the 
agar.  Each  well  was  then  filled  with  10  µL  of  the  different  cell-free 
supernatant (LAB culture filtrate). After incubation at 37°C for 24 h, 
the  plates  were  observed  for  a  zone  of  inhibition  around  the  well. 
The  antimicrobial  activity  was  expressed  as  the  diameter  of  the 
inhibition zones around the wells. Results were considered positive 
if the diameter of the zones of inhibition were greater than or equal 
to 4 mm. The negative control used was sterile distilled water while 
the  positive  control  used  were  100  IU  of  diluted  Ciprofloxacin  and 
Azithromycin. 
 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Characteristics of samples 
 
The  measurement  of  the  pH  shows  that  corn-beer  is 
more acidic in nature with a pH range of 6.18 at collection 
time to 4.32 after 48 h fermentation; against 6.51 to 4.66 
for palm-wine. However, palm wine taste more sour than 
corn-beer.  This  may  be  because  corn-beer  is  richer  in 
moulds  and  yeasts  than  palm  wine  (Ogbonnaya  and 
Bernice,  2012).  These  microorganisms  may  produce 
organic  acid  which  might  have  an  influence  on  the 
souring taste of the corn-beer.  

The lactic acid bacteria population  in corn-beer ranges 
from  1.2×107  to  6.7×107  CFU/mL  as  against  2.5×107  to 
7.5×107 CFU/ml for palm-wine. Thus, palm-wine is richer 
in  LAB  population  than  corn-beer.  The  sludge  of  corn-
beer and the sap of the palm tree have been shown to be 
a  rich  medium  capable  of  supporting  the  growth  of 
various 
types  of  microorganisms.  The  dominant 
populations  of  microorganisms  include  aerobic  meso-
philic  bacteria,  yeasts,  moulds  and  lactic  acid  bacteria 
(Chandrasekhar  et al., 2012; Parveens and Hafiz, 2003).

Isolation, characterization and identification of LAB 
 
Following  culture  on  MRS  agar,  a  total  of  thirty-three 
isolates  Gram  positive  and  catalase  negative  rods,  cocci 
or  tetrads  were  obtained  from  palm-wine  and  corn-beer, 
as  presumptive  lactic  acid  bacteria.  Of  this  number, 
fourteen  were  from  palm-wine  and  nineteen  from  corn-
beer. The isolates from corn-beer were coded Cb1, Cb2, 
Cb3, Cb4, Cb5, Cb6, Cb7, Cb8, Cb9, Cb10, Cb11, Cb12, 
Cb13, Cb14, Cb15, Cb16, Cb17, Cb18 and Cb19;   while 
those from palm wine were coded Pw1, Pw2, Pw3, Pw4, 
Pw5,  Pw6,  Pw7,  Pw8,  Pw9,  Pw10,  Pw11,  Pw12,  Pw13 
and  Pw14.  These  isolates  were  further  biochemically 
characterized  and  identified  using  the  API  50  CHL  Kit 
(BioMerieux, France).  

carnosum 

The  nineteen  catalase  negative  isolates  obtained  from 
corn  beer  were  identified  using  API  50  CHL  BioMerieux 
Kit.  They  were  identified  as    Lactobacillus  plantarum 
(Cb1, Cb2, Cb3, Cb8),  Lactobacillus brevis (Cb5, Cb12, 
Cb19),    Leuconostoc  mesenteroides  (Cb4,  Cb6,  CB15) 
and  Leuconostoc 
(Cb7);  Pediococcus 
acidilactici  (Cb9,  Cb11,  Cb13,  Cb17),  Lactobacillus 
fermentum  (Cb10),  Lactobacillus  acidophilus  (Cb14, 
Cb16), Lactobacillus bulgaricus (C18)  while the fourteen 
(14)  LAB  isolates  from  corn-beer,  were  found  to  consist 
of mainly  5  different species  namely,  L. plantarum  (Pw2, 
Pw5,  Pw11)  ,  L.  brevis    (Pw1,  Pw12,  Pw14),    L. 
mesenteroides  (Pw3,  Pw9,  Pw13),  L.  carnosum  (Pw4, 
Pw7, Pw10), L. pentosus (Pw6, Pw8). The distribution of 
the LAB isolates is given in Table 1. 

Nineteen presumptive LAB isolates were obtained from 
corn-beer samples from which 8 different LAB species (L. 
fermentum,  L.  plantarum,  L.  mesenteroides,  L.  brevis,  L. 
Carnosum,  P.  acidilactici,  L.  acidophilus  and  L. 
bulgaricus) were identified (Table 1). Meanwhile fourteen 
(14) presumptive LAB isolates  were obtained from palm-
wine  samples  from  which  5  different  LAB  species  (L. 
brevis, L. plantarum, L. mesenteroides, L.  

Fossi et al.          1143 

 
 
 
carnosum  and  L.  pentosus)  were  identified  (Table  1). 
This is somehow contradictory to the fact that palm-wine 
is richer in LAB population. However, it can be concluded 
that corn-beer is richer in the content of LAB isolates than 
palm  wine  while  palm  wine  is  richer  in  LAB  population 
than corn  beer.  Four  LAB  species  namely:  L.  plantarum, 
L.  mesenteroides,  L.  brevis  and  L.  carnosum  were 
commonly  isolated  from  both  corn-beer  and  palm-wine 
samples.  However, 
(P. 
acidilactici,  L.  acidophilus  and  L.  bulgaricus)  were 
isolated  only  from corn-beer,  while just  one LAB  species 
(L.  pentosus)  was  isolated  only  in  palm-wine  samples. 
Thus, there is some basic similarity in the content of LAB 
species found in both beverages.  

four  other  LAB  species 

isolates  against 

indicator 

It can be observed from Tables 1 and 2 that lactobacilli 
and  leuconostocs  were  the  sole  lactic  acid  bacteria 
isolated  from  palm  wine  samples,  with  lactobacilli  being 
the  predominant  LAB  (57.1%).  Lactobacilli  are  also  the 
predominant  LAB  in  corn-beer  (57.9%).  This  result  is 
similar  to  the  finding  of  Nwachukwu  et  al.  (2010).  They 
have  isolated  similar  species  in  traditional  weaning  food 
called “Ogi” in Nigeria 
 
 
Determination of antimicrobial activity 
 
Figure  1  shows  the  plate  assays  for  inhibitory  activity  of 
some  LAB 
food  borne 
pathogens.  All  the  LAB  isolates  from  corn-beer  inhibited 
the  indicator  food-borne  bacterial  pathogens  to  some 
degree.  The 
the  MICs  are 
summarized 
respectively. 
Pediococcus  acidilactici  manifested  a  very  remarkable 
antimicrobial  effect  on  the  tested  food-borne  pathogens 
with mean  zones  of  inhibition  of  19,  20  and  16  mm; and 
MICs  of  64,  64  and  32  mg/ml  (Figure  3),  on  E.  coli,  S. 
typhi  and  S.  aureus,  respectively.  These  LAB  species 
were  obtained  from  samples  of  all  the  towns  in  Fako 
Division  with  no  significant  difference  in  their  zone  of 
inhibition. These results were similar to those obtained by 
Lee  et  al.  (2013).  These  authors  reported  the  ability  of 
LAB  such  as  L.  rhamnosus  and  L.  lactis  to  inhibit 
Clostridium difficile.

On the other hand, all the LAB isolates from palm-wine 
equally  inhibited  all  the  food-borne  bacterial  pathogens 
tested, by very significant degrees (Figure 2). L. pentosus 
manifested the most remarkable antimicrobial effect from 
these palm wine samples with mean zones of inhibition of 
15, 17 and 15 mm (Figure 2); and MICs of 32, 64 and 32 
mg/ml  (Figure  3),  on  E.  coli,  S.  typhi  and  S.  aureus, 
respectively. These LAB species were obtained only from 
palm-wine samples from Tiko and Buea and there was no 
significance  difference  in  their  zones  of  inhibition  on  the 
indicator pathogens. 

Meanwhile,  L.  carnosum 

from  corn-beer  samples 
manifested  the  least  antimicrobial  inhibitory  potential  on 
the  tests  organism,  while  L.  brevis  from  palm-wine 
manifested the least. These two LAB species are found in

LABs 

from

Generally, 

have  more 
antimicrobial  inhibitory  potential  on  food-borne  bacterial 
pathogens than LABs from palm-wine. However, the least 
inhibitory  potential  on 
food  borne  pathogens  was 
observed  from  corn-beer  and  was  impacted  by  L. 
acidophilus  (07  mm)  and  L.  carnosum  (9  mm)  on  S. 
aureus.  

The  most  susceptible  food-borne  pathogen  to  LAB 
antimicrobial from corn-beer and palm-wine was S.  typhi.

to  many  antibiotics 

This  is  interesting  because  Salmonella  sp.  has  been 
reported  as  one  of  the  leading  cause  of  illnesses  due  to 
food-borne  pathogens,  and  the  pathogen  has  become 
very 
in  Cameroon 
(Akoachere  et  al.,  2009).  Therefore,  antimicrobials 
produced  by  lactic  acid  bacteria  from  corn-beer  and 
palm-wine  can  be  exploited  for  the  treatment  and 
prevention  of  S.  typhi  infections.  On  the  other  hand,  the 
least susceptible food-borne pathogen is  S. aureus. This 
is  of  little  worrying  because,  since  the   emergence  of

Staphylococcal  infections  but  this  does  not  look  very 
promising.  However,  S.  aureus  was  greatly  inhibited  by 
antimicrobial from L. fermentum (17 mm). 
 
 
Determination of the inhibitory substance of the LAB 
isolates 
 
All  the  LAB  isolates  inhibited  the  indicator  food  borne 
pathogens tested to some degree by one or two or all of 
the tested antimicrobial substances namely:  Bacteriocins 
(B), hydrogen peroxide (H) and organic acids (A) (Tables 
2  and  3).  However,  the  LAB  isolates  from  corn-beer 
inhibited  the  majority  of  the  pathogens  by  mostly  their 
bacteriocins (Table 2), while the LAB isolates from palm-
wine  inhibited  the  indicator  pathogens  by  mostly  their 
bacteriocins  and  hydrogen  peroxide  (Table  3).  Acid 
exerted the  least  inhibitory  action on  the  test  pathogens. 
Since LAB samples showed a high acidity, the real effect 
of  the  acid  on  the  indicator  pathogens  might  have  been 
lost  in  the  initial  medium  in  which  the  LABs  were 
contained.  The  missing  percentages  suggest  that  other 
factors  may  contribute  to  inhibition  of  the  food-borne 
pathogens, 
just  bacteriocin,  hydrogen 
peroxide  and  acid.  Example  of  such  factors  may  be 
bacteriophages.  The  missing  value  may  also  be  due  to 
the 
inhibitory 
substances by the study methodology.

Following  the  profound  antimicrobial  effect  exerted  by 
LAB isolates on indicator pathogens, and the determined 
antimicrobial  substances  to  that  effect, the  purification  of 
antimicrobial substance produced by LAB from corn-beer 
and  palm-wine  can  be  of  great  medicinal  value  to  the 
fight against food-borne pathogens. It is worth noting that 
bacteriocins  from  LAB  are  Generally  Regarded  as  Safe 
(GRAS) (O’Shea et al., 2013). 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
The   findings   obtained   in    this    study    showed   that  

for 

traditionally  processed  corn-beer  and  palm-wine,  are 
particularly  rich  in  their  content  of  lactic  acid  bacteria 
whose  antimicrobial  properties  can  be  exploited  in  the 
fight  against  human  diseases  especially 
food-borne 
pathogenic bacteria. Bacteriocins were the most common 
inhibitory  substance  utilized  by  the  LAB  isolates  from 
corn-beer and palm-wine to inhibit food borne pathogens. 
S.  typhi  appeared  to be  the most  susceptible food-borne 
bacterial  pathogen  to  the  LAB.  Therefore,  corn-beer  and 
palm-wine obtained from Fako division of Cameroon can 
display  great  potentials 
the  development  of 
antimicrobial against bacterial food borne pathogens.
