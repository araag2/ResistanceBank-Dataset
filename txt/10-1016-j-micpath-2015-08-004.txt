Staphylococci are the leading pathogens of bovine mastitis which is difficult to control. However, 

the published data on the prevalence of staphylococcal species, virulence and antibiotic resistance 

genes in bovine mastitis from China are limited. In this study, 104 out of 209 subclinical mastitis milk 

samples from a single Chinese dairy herd were cultured-positive for staphylococci (49.8%), which 

were further identified as coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS) or coagulase-negative staphylococci 

(CNS). According to the partial tuf and/or 16S rRNA gene sequence, the 28 CPS isolates were 

confirmed to be S. aureus (26.9%), and 76 CNS isolates were assigned to 13 different species (73.1%) 

with S. arlettae, S. sciuri, S. xylosus and S. chromogenes as the dominant species. In the 28 S. aureus 

isolates, the most prevalent general virulence genes were coa, Ig and eno (100%), followed by hla

(96.4%), hlb (92.9%), fib (92.9%), clfA (89.3%), clfB (85.7%) and nuc (85.7%). Both exotoxin and 

biofilm-associated genes were significantly less prevalent than the previously reported. Although 19 

different virulence gene patterns were found, only one was dominant (32.1%). The prevalence of blaZ 

(82.1%) or mecA gene (35.7%) was much higher than the previously reported. In the 76 CNS isolates, 

the virulence genes were significantly less prevalent than that in the S. aureus isolates. Among the 4 

main CNS species, S. chromogenes (n=12) was the only species with high percentage (75%) of blaZ 

gene, while S. sciuri (n=12) was the only species with the high percentage (66.7%) of mecA gene. The 

most of antibiotic resistance genes were present as multi-resistance genes, and the antibiotic resistances 

were attributed by different resistance genes between resistant S. aureus and CNS isolates. These data 

suggest that the prevalence of staphylococcal species, virulence and antibiotic resistance in the mastitis 

milk from the Chinese dairy herd are different from the previously reported, and that the herd- or 

farm-based diagnosis of staphylococcal bovine mastitis is required.

Staphylococci  are  the  bacteria  most  commonly  isolated  from  bovine  mastitis  [1].  In  mastitis 

diagnosis, staphylococci can be divided into coagulase-positive (CPS) and coagulase-negative (CNS) 

based on the ability to coagulate rabbit plasma. The major pathogen S. aureus, including a broad range 

of genotypes  with distinct pathogenic  and epidemiologic characteristics,  can cause clinical, but often 

subclinical mastitis [2]. Although CNS species are traditionally considered as minor mastitis pathogens 

[3],  they  have  become  the  dominant  pathogens  of  subclinical  or  mild  clinical  infections  in  many

well-managed dairy herds [4, 5]. This group of staphylococci consists of more than 40 different species 

and subspecies of which a dozen are commonly found in milk of dairy cows [6, 7]. Although a number 

of studies have been conducted to identify reservoirs of CNS, the epidemiology CNS mastitis is still 

unclear, in China in particular [4].   

Various virulence factors have been found in S. aureus from bovine mastitis, including 

haemolysins (HLA and HLB), leukocidin, exfoliative toxins (ETA to ETD), staphylococcal 

enterotoxins (SEs), toxic-shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), and biofilm formation [8, 9]. Except for 

their pathogenic role in bovine mastitis, some toxin-producing S. aureus strains pose a risk for humans 

and animals [10]. These toxin genes are mainly located on the mobile genetic elements, and thus can 

spread among staphylococcal isolates or species [11, 12]. Although these toxin genes were originally 

identified in S. aureus isolates, some of them have also been detected in a variety of CNS species from 

the mammary glands of cattle and other ruminants [13], which may become a possible reservoir of 

toxin genes typically identified in S. aureus. However, only few studies have so far focused on the 

virulence factors of CNS isolated from bovine mastitis [3].   

S. aureus has the potential to develop resistance to almost all antimicrobial agents [14]. Due to the 

extensive use of antibiotics as bovine mastitis antibacterial agents, the antimicrobial resistance 

developed by staphylococci is one of main reasons for low cure rate of mastitis [14, 15]. More 

importantly, the emergence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains has become a major 

public health concern [16]. Furthermore, CNS species tend to be more resistant to antimicrobials than S. 

aureus, and easily develop multi-resistance [17]. Therefore, the investigation into antimicrobial 

resistance in the staphylococci from dairy cows is important not only for bovine mastitis control, but 

also for public health. However, the published data on the difference in antibiotic resistance genes

among CNS species are limited, from China in particular [18, 19].   

In the light of limited data on the genotypic identification of bovine mastitis staphylococci from 

China, the objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of staphylococcal species, virulence 

and antibiotic resistance in subclinical mastitis milk from a single dairy cow herd.

During the period from June 2012 to June 2014, a field study was conducted on a single dairy farm 

in Jiangsu Province, China. The dairy farm was well-managed and self-contained which had 

comparable characteristics reflecting the general situation on Chinese middle-sized dairy farms. The 

herd size was 748 Holstein cows with an average production of 85,000kg of milk/cow per year. On the 

dairy farm, cows were housed in freestalls with concrete floors and sawdust bedded cubicles. Sawdust 

bedding was removed 2 to 3 times a day, and replaced by fresh sawdust from a stock stored indoors. 

Postmilking teat disinfection was practiced by standard iodine dipping. Dry cow therapy was practiced 

with ampicillin and cloxacillin enzathine injection. Incidence rates of clinical and subclinical mastitis 

cases during the past two years were 5% and 18%, respectively. The clinical mastitis cows were treated 

in rotation with kanamycin, cefazolin and compound Chinese medicine consisting of Flos lonicerae 

japonicae, Radix scutellariae, Taraxacum platypecidum, Radix glycyrrhizae, and Angelica dahurica. 

During the period of this study, 6 cohorts of 35 subclinical mastitis cows were randomly selected for

According to the estimation of somatic cell count (SCC) using California mastitis test (CMT), a 

mammary quarter was considered with subclinical mastitis when the SCC was greater than 250,000/ml 

in individual quarter foremilk without overt clinical signs [20]. Quarter milk samples were collected 

aseptically at bimonthly intervals (n=6) from the cohort cows according standard procedures [21]. 

Samples were transported immediately on ice to the laboratory for bacteriological examination. 

2.3 Staphylococcal isolation 

Bacteriological culture of milk samples and bacterial identification were done as recommended by 

the National Mastitis Council [21]. Briefly, 0.1 ml of each milk sample was spread on each sheep blood 

agar plate and incubated for 24 h at 37 ℃. Phenotypic differentiation of bacterial species was done as 

previously described [22]. Staphylococci were identified presumptively based on colony morphology, 

Gram’s stain, and catalase test. S. aureus was differentiated from other Staphylococcus spp. based on 

morphology, pigmentation, hemolysis, Coa tube test and thermonuclase (Nuc) activity. All of non-S. 

aureus staphylococci were a priori considered as CNS. For milk samples yielding at least 3 CNS 

colonies, 2 colonies were picked and transferred to self-made tryptone soy agar (TSA) for further 

identification. When more than one type of CNS colony was present, more colonies were picked. The 

TSA plates were incubated for 18 h at 37 ℃. The mammary quarter was considered S. aureus and CNS 

infected when the number of bacterial colonies was ≥50 and 250cfu/ml, respectively [23].

Each colony was picked from TSA plates and grown overnight at 37 ℃ in LB both.

Staphylococcal genomic DNA was extracted using High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit (Roche, 

Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The concentration of DNA was adjusted 

to 100ng/µl by addition of deionized water. Staphylococcal isolates were genotypically identified by 

PCR amplification of tuf, coa and nuc genes as previously described [24]. PCR amplification was 

performed in 25µl volumes using 50 ng of DNA template, 2.5 U of rTaq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, 

Dalian, China), 1 × Taq buffer, 0.25 mM dNTP mix, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 µmol of each primer. The 

primer sequences for amplification of coa and nuc genes are listed in Table 1. The tuf gene segments 

were amplified using the primer pair of 5'-GCCAGTTGAGGACGTATTCT-3' and 

5'-CCATTTCAGTACCTTCTGGTAA-3'.

Staphylococcal species were differentiated first by sequencing the PCR products of partial tuf gene 

segments. PCR products were purified using High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche) 

according to the manufacturer’s instruction, and submitted to forward and reverse sequencing. The 

generated sequences were searched against staphylococcal tuf gene sequences in GenBank, and a 

sequence identity of ≥98.0% was used as the rule for speciation [24]. For the non-definitive strains, 16S 

rRNA genes were amplified with primer pair of 5'-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3' and 

5'-CCGTCAATTCMTTTRAGTTT-3' for sequencing and species discrimination [13].

All staphylococcal isolates were tested by PCR for the presence of virulence genes (Table 1). The 

coa gene coding for Coa [25], spa gene for protein A [25], Ig gene for Ig-binding protein [26], map 

gene  for  MHC  class  II  analog  protein  [27]  or  bap  gene  for  biofilm-associated  protein  [28]  was

amplified by PCR as previously described. The other virulence genes were amplified by duplex [28-31] 

or multiplex PCR [32-35] as previously described. The primer sequences for amplification of virulence 

genes are listed in Table 1. 

2.7 Detection of antibiotic resistance genes 

All staphylococcal isolates were also tested by PCR for the presence of antibiotic resistance genes. 

The linA gene conferring resistance to lincosamides was detected by PCR as previously described [36]. 

The other antibiotic genes were detected by duplex [36] or multiplex PCR [37, 38]. The primer 

sequences for amplification antibiotic genes are listed in Table 2.   

2.8 Detection of antibiotic resistance 

All staphylococcal isolates, as well as S. aureus reference strain ATCC25923 (ATCC, USA), were 

tested for antibiotic susceptibilities with the disc diffusion method (Clinical and Laboratory Standards 

Institute, 2013, CLSI2013) using Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) plates (OXOID, USA) that contained the 

following 9 antibiotics: cefoxitin, clindamycin, erythromycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, penicillin, 

streptomycin, tetracycline and tobramycin. The resistance breakpoints were those proposed for 

staphylococci in the guidelines of CLSI2013.

out 104 staphylococcal isolates were identified as S. aureus (26.9%) and the remaining 76 isolates were 

a priori considered as CNS (Table 3).   

3.2 Genotypic identification of staphylococcal species 

The partial tuf gene sequence analysis showed that the 28 S. aureus isolates had 100% sequence 

similarity to the reference strain (Table 4). By using a sequence identity of ≥98.0% as the rule for 

speciation, 76 CNS isolates were assigned into 13 different species based on tuf and/or 16S rRNA gene 

sequences. Among these, 70 isolates were identified to the species level (92.1%) according to the 

partial tuf gene sequences only (Table 4). The remaining 6 CNS isolates had 96.9% or 97.5% tuf gene 

similarity to S. xylosus or S. hyicus reference strain. Among them, 5 isolates were confirmed as S. 

xylosus and another one as S. hyicus with 99% 16S rRNA sequence similarity to the reference strain 

(Table 4). Among the 76 CNS isolates, S. arlettae, S. sciuri, S. xylosus and S. chromogenes were the 

dominant species (a total of 63.2%), followed by S. epidermidis, S. simulans, S. equorum, S. 

haemolyticus, S. warneri and other four (Table 4).

21 

The presence of 37 virulence genes in the staphylococci from subclinical mastitis milk was 

detected by PCR. These virulence genes could be divided into three functional groups: general 

virulence factors, exotoxins and biofilm formation. In 28 S. aureus isolates, the most prevalent general 

virulence factor genes were the coa for coagulase, Ig for Ig binding protein, and eno for laminin 

binding protein (100%), followed by hla (96.4%) and hlb (92.9%) for hemolysins, fib (92.9%) for 

fibrinogen binding protein, clfA (89.3%) and clfB (85.7%) for clumping factors, and nuc (85.7%) for 

thermonuclease (Table 5). Among the 12 exotoxin genes tested, only seg (14.3%), sei (10.7%) and sea

(7.1%) for enterotoxins were detected. Among the 10 biofilm-associated genes tested, the most 

prevalent gene was spa (96.4%) for protein A, followed by fnbB (75%) for fibronectin binding protein, 

icaD (71.4%) for intercellular adhesion, and agr-1 (64.3%) and agr-2 (17.9%) for accessory gene 

regulation (Table 5). Although 19 different gene patterns were found in the 28 S. aureus isolates, only 

one (Ig, coa, eno, spa, hla, hlb, fib, clfA, clfB, nuc, map, fnbB, icaD, agr-1, cap5) was the dominant 

(32.1%) gene combination (Table 6). In the 76 CNS isolates, the most prevalent general virulence gene 

was eno (53.9%), followed by Ig (18.4%) and map for MHC class II analog protein (11.8%). Among 

the 12 exotoxin genes tested, only sei (5.3%) and seb (2.6%) were detected. Among the 10 

biofilm-associated genes tested, only bap for biofilm-associated protein (10.5%), agr-2 (3.9%), fnbA 

(2.6%) and fnbB (2.6%) genes were detected (Table 5). Although different virulence gene patterns were 

also present in the 13 CNS species, they consisted of only 1-4 virulence genes (Table 6).

The presence of 17 antibiotic resistance genes in the staphylococci from subclinical mastitis milk 

was also detected by PCR. In the 28 S. aureus isolates, the most prevalent antibiotic resistance gene 

was blaZ conferring the resistance to penicillin (82.1%), followed by mecA to methicillin (35.7%), 

aacA-aphD to aminoglycoside (32.1%), aac(6’)/aph(2’’) to streptomycin (28.6%), tetK to tetracycline 

(10.7%), ermC to erythromycin and clindamycin and linA to lincosamides (7.1%; Table 7). These 

antibiotic resistance genes were present as 6 different gene combinations containing 1-4 genes (Table 

8). In the 76 CNS isolates, the most prevalent antibiotic resistance gene was linA (38.2%), followed by 

tetK (34.2%), blaZ (30.3%), aacA-aphD (21.1%), msrB (19.7%), msrA (17.1%), mecA (17.1%), ermC 

(13.2%), aac(6’)/aph(2’’) (10.5%), ermB (9.2%), and tetM (2.6%; Table 7). These antibiotic resistance

genes were also present as different gene combinations containing 1-7 genes (Table 8).   

3.5 Detection of antibiotic resistance in staphylococci 

In  the  28  S.  aureus  isolates,  penicillin  resistance  was  the  most  frequent  resistance  phenotype 

(82.1%),  followed  by  resistance  to  streptomycin  (46.4%),  kanamycin  and  tobramycin  (35.7%), 

cefoxitin  and  gentamicin  (32.1%),  erythromycin  (14.3%),  tetracycline  (10.7%),  and  clindamycin 

(3.6%). In the 76 CNS isolates, penicillin resistance was also the most frequent resistance phenotype 

(86.8%),  but  followed  by  resistance  to  erythromycin  (48.7%),  streptomycin  (46.1%),  tetracycline 

(39.5%), clindamycin (30.3%), cefoxitin and kanamycin (27.6%), gentamicin (13.2%), and tobramycin 

(11.8%). Resistance to 2 or more antibiotics was present in 100% % of the S. aureus isolates (n=23) 

10 

or in 79.4% CNS isolates (n=68). The genes attributed to antibiotic resistances are listed in Table 9.

This study provides different data on the prevalence of staphylococcal species, virulence and 

antibiotic resistance genes in subclinical mastitis milk from a Chinese dairy farm. According to the 

bacteriological examination, 104 out of 209 milk samples were cultured-positive for Staphylococci 

(49.8 %), confirming that staphylococci were the main pathogen of bovine mastitis in China and other 

countries [19]. Among the 104 staphylococcal isolates, 28 and 76 isolates were further identified as S. 

aureus (26.9%) and CNS (73.1%), respectively, which supported the previous finding that CNS species 

have become the dominant pathogens of subclinical or mild clinical infections [4, 5].   

Molecular identification has been proposed as the gold standard for bovine CNS speciation [39]. 

Among the proposed molecular methods, although 16S rRNA gene sequencing is widely used, the high 

degree of sequence similarity between closely related species limits its usefulness for some CNS

speciation. Recently, the partial tuf gene sequencing has been proved to be a reliable method for CNS 

identification [24]. Therefore, in this study we amplified the partial tuf genes from 104 staphylococcal 

isolates from subclinical mastitis milk for staphylococcal speciation. Sequence analysis showed that the 

28 S. aureus isolates had 100% sequence similarity to the reference strain, confirming the reliability of 

partial tuf gene sequencing for S. aureus identification. For 76 CNS isolates, however, only 70 isolates 

were identified to the species level (92.1%) based on the partial tuf gene sequence only (Table 4). The 

remaining 6 CNS isolates had the highest tuf sequence similarity with S. xylosus (96.9%) or S. hyicus 

(97.5%) reference strain, which was below the cut-off value (≥98.0%) for speciation [24]. Therefore, 

we amplified the 16S rRNA genes for further speciation. Among them, 5 isolates were identified as S. 

xylosus and one as S. hyicus with 99% sequence identity to the reference strains. These data suggest 

that, like 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the partial tuf gene sequencing alone was insufficient to 

distinguish some closely related CNS species.   

More than 20 CNS species have been isolated from bovine milk, and five of them (S. chromogenes, 

S. simulans, S. haemolyticus, S. xylosus and S. epidermidis) are considered as the main CNS species [3, 

40]. In this study, however, S. arlettae and S. sciuri, together with S. chromogenes and S. xylosus, were 

identified as the dominant CNS species. Moreover, the previously reported main CNS species, S. 

haemolyticus and S. epidermidis, were less prevalent, S. haemolyticus (3.9%) in particular. These data 

suggest that the distribution of main CNS species in mastitis milk was different among dairy farms or 

herds. This was supported by a recent study, in which S. warneri, S. epidermidis and S. hyicus are 

identified to be the dominant species among 18 CNS species isolated from CMT-positive cow milk 

21 

[41].   

22 

Various virulence factors have been identified in S. aureus isolates from bovine mastitis. However,

only few staphylococcal virulence factors have been tested in animal models. Among these, one 

HLA-positive S. aureus isolate has been shown to be most virulent in a mouse model, followed by 

HLA- and HLB-positive isolates, and HLB-positive isolates. The least virulent isolates are the 

non-hemolytic S. aureus strains, but even they are more virulent than two CNS species tested [42]. In 

this study, most S. aureus isolates harbored the hla (96.4%) and/or hlb (92.9%) gene, indicating their 

potential virulence in bovine mastitis. Exotoxins are a special class of virulence factors with several 

potential functions and public health concern [3, 43]. Although these toxins are originally identified in 

S. aureus, they have also been detected in CNS, including the isolates from bovine milk [41]. In this 

study, however, only three (sea, seg and sei) or two (seb and sei) enterotoxin genes were detected in 28 

S. aureus (32.1%) or 76 CNS isolates (7.9%), which were significantly less prevalent than the 

previously reported (up to 66%). The possible reason (s) for this could be due to the low prevalence of 

toxin-producing staphylococcal isolates in the dairy herd, and/or the presence of other toxin genes 

which were not tested. It is currently accepted that the most important virulence factor of CNS is 

biofilm formation [44, 45]. Among the biofilm-associated genes identified, the ica gene cluster coding 

for intercellular adhesion proteins has a wide distribution, and thus is traditionally regarded as the most 

important biofilm-associated gene in human-associated CNS [44, 46]. However, this appears not to be 

the case for CNS from bovine mastitis milk [3]. In this study, for example, 20 out of 28 S. aureus 

isolates were positive for icaD but not icaA gene, both of which were not detected in the 76 CNS 

isolates (Table 5). The bap gene encoding biofilm-associated protein has also been identified in 

biofilm-producing staphylococci from bovine mastitis [47]. Among the 76 CNS isolates in this study, 

however, only 8 isolates harbored the bap gene (10.5%), which was significantly less prevalent than 

that (~50%) of the previously reported [48]. In addition, the bap gene was found only in two CNS

species (S. xylosus and S. equorum), but not in the 28 S. aureus and other CNS species (Table 6). The 

eno gene encoding laminin-binding protein has been shown to be the most frequent (75%) among the 

CNS isolates from mastitis [49]. This was supported by our investigation, in which 100% of S. aureus 

and 53.9% of CNS isolates were positive for eno gene (Table 5). The virulence genes listed above are 

frequently present in different combinations. In this study, however, although 19 virulence gene 

combinations were found in the 28 S. aureus isolates, only one was the dominant (32.1%). Due to their 

low prevalence of virulence genes, the virulence gene patterns in the 13 CNS species were much fewer 

and simpler with only 1-4 virulence genes (Table 6).   

The most common resistance mechanism in staphylococci is blactamase production. The reported 

percentage of penicillin resistance in the CNS isolates from bovine mastitis is variable from 25% to 

61%, which is generally higher than that in S. aureus (from 7% to 32%) from some European countries 

[46]. In this study, however, 82.1% of S. aureus isolates contained the blaZ gene, the prevalence of 

which was significantly higher than that (30.3%) in the 76 CNS isolates (Table 7). Among the 13 CNS 

species, S. epidermidis was the species with the highest percentage of blaZ gene (100%), followed by S. 

chromogenes (75%). Moreover, most of the blaZ genes were present as the multi-resistance genes in 

both S. aureus and CNS isolates (Table 8). The higher prevalence of blaZ gene may be due to the 

frequent use of penicillin for dry cow therapy on this dairy farm. In addition, these data also suggest the 

potential spread of penicillin-resistant staphylococci within the dairy herd. The emergence of MRSA 

infection in dairy animals is of great concern for livestock and public health [50]. Previous surveys 

have shown that methicillin resistance is relatively rare in S. aureus (from 2.5% to 4%) from mastitis 

milk [46]. In this study, however, 35.7% of S. aureus and 17.1% of CNS isolates were positive for 

mecA gene (Table 7), the prevalence of which was not only much higher than the previously reported

from some European countries, but also higher than the recently reported (15.5%) from China [19]. 

Among the 4 dominant CNS species, S. sciuri was the only species harboring mecA gene. As expected, 

all of the mecA genes were present as multi-resistance genes in the S. aureus and CNS isolates (Table 

8). Once again, these data indicate the potential spread of multi-resistant staphylococci within the dairy 

herd.   

Another interesting finding in this investigation was the difference in antibiotic resistance 

attributed by different antibiotic resistance genes between the resistant S. aureus and CNS isolates. For 

example, the penicillin resistance was attributed completely by the blaZ gene in the resistant S. aureus 

isolates (n=23), compared to 34.8% by the blaZ gene and 65.2% by unknown gene in the resistant CNS 

isolates (n=66; Table 9). In addition, the cefoxitin resistance was attributed mainly (88.9%) by the 

mecA + blaZ gene in the resistant S. aureus isolates (n=9), compared to 42.9%, 28.6%, 19.0% and 

9.5% by the mecA gene, unknown gene, mecA + blaZ gene and blaZ gene in the resistant CNS isolates 

(n=21). The different attributions of antibiotic resistance genes to other antibiotic resistances were also 

found between the resistant S. aureus and CNS isolates (Table 9). These data suggest the existence of 

different antibiotic resistance mechanisms between the S. aureus and CNS from bovine mastitis milk.
