Abstract
Purpose – Broad-spectrum cephalosporin resistance is rapidly increasing in Escherichia coli, representing a
food safety problem. The purpose of this paper is to characterize eight extended-spectrum-ß-lactamase (ESBL)
and acquired AmpC ß-lactamase-producing E. coli isolates and virotypes associated, obtained from chicken
and pork food samples in Puebla, Mexico.
Design/methodology/approach – Samples (36 from chicken and 10 from pork) were cultured on Levine
agar plates supplemented with cefotaxime (2 mg/L) for isolation of cefotaxime-resistant (CTXR) E. coli. CTXR-
E. coli isolates were detected in 33 of 46 samples (72 percent), and one isolate/sample was characterized (28
from chicken and 5 from pork), for ESBL production, phylogenetic group, sequence typing, resistance and
virulence genes by PCR and sequencing.
Findings – Results showed 16 ESBL-E. coli (35 percent) (12/16 belonging to phylogroup B1) and 8 CMY-2-E.
coli (17 percent). ESBL detected were as follows (number of isolates): CTX-M-2 (8); CTX-M-1 (2); CTX-M-15 (1);
SHV-2a (4) and TEM-52c (1). In total, 20 different sequence types (STs) were identified among the ESBL- or
CMY-2-producing E. coli strains, which included four new ones. The CTX-M-15 β-lactamase was detected in
one E. coli ST617-ST10 Cplx-B1 strain that also carried ibeA gene. One CMY-2-positive strain of lineage
ST224-B2 was detected and it carried the qnrA1 gene.

Originality/value – In this study, a ST131-based virotyping scheme for strains from food of animal origin
was established since this kind of strains constitutes an important vehicle of virulent ESBL- and CMY-2-
producing E. coli isolates, which could be transmitted to humans by direct contact or through the food chain.

1. Introduction
Escherichia coli is a common inhabitant of the intestinal tract of most animals and humans
(Torres, 2016), and can easily contaminate food products of animal origin destined to human
consumption (Apata, 2009). These strains are reservoir of extended-spectrum β-lactamases
and integrons that could be transmitted to humans through the food chain (Liebana et al.,
2013). Extended-spectrum-ß-lactamase (ESBL) of the CTX-M type represent a major problem
and a therapeutic challenge in human health (Livermore et al., 2007; Rocha-Gracia et al., 2015).
The detection of ESBL-positive E. coli isolates from food-producing animals and food
products has been increasingly reported in the last years worldwide. Nevertheless, this type of
studies is scarce in Latin America (Bevan et al., 2017). To our knowledge, there are no reports
about ESBL-producing E. coli isolated from food-producing animals in Mexico. Likewise,
acquired AmpC β-lactamases (acAmpC) represent another important mechanism of resistance,
because of the broad spectrum of resistance they confer ( Jacoby, 2009), as well as their
co-existence with other encoding resistance genes (Alonso et al., 2016). The enzymes AmpC
inactivate broad-spectrum cephalosporins as well as cephamycins (cefoxitin) and are not
inhibited by clavulanic acid. Among them, those of the CMY class cause problems for therapy
of E. coli infections and are the most commonly found acAmpC worldwide (Guo et al., 2014;
Shin et al., 2017). It is known that all E. coli isolates harbor a chromosomal ampC β-lactamase
encoding gene not associated to β-lactam resistance. Nevertheless, specific nucleotidic point
mutations in the promoter/attenuator region of this gene (particularly at the −42 or −32
positions) respect to the one of E. coli K12 are associated with the hyperproduction of this
chromosomal AmpC β-lactamase (Caroff et al., 2000). This hyperproduction is associated with
resistance to some β-lactamic antimicrobials as ampicillin, amoxicillin–clavulanic acid and
cefoxitin, and also confers low-level resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins. Several
studies show the dissemination of this resistance mechanism among E. coli isolates from food
samples of animal origin (Ben Sallem et al., 2014; Dhanji et al., 2010; Jones-Dias et al., 2016;
Kawamura et al., 2015; Martin et al., 2012; Sheikh et al., 2012). To our knowledge, in Mexico
there are only two reports about
the dissemination of CMY enzyme in Salmonella
Typhimurium and E. coli of human and animal origin, respectively (Zaidi et al., 2007; Aguilar-
Montes de Oca et al., 2015). In the clinical practice, E. coli that produce ESBLs and acAmpC
usually also carry resistance genes for other antibiotics, which limit the therapeutic options
(Paterson and Bonomo 2005). Additionally, the co-occurrence of resistance and virulence
determinants implies a clinical challenge (Da Silva and Mendonça, 2012). These resistant-
virulent bacteria could enter the food chain, representing an important food safety problem
because they can transfer resistance genes to other pathogenic or non-pathogenic bacteria. The
objective of our study was to detect ESBL- and acAmpC-producing E. coli isolates in food
samples of animal origin in Puebla, Mexico and to characterize the β-lactamases, genetic
lineages, resistance and virulence genes of recovered isolates.

2. Material and methods
2.1 Samples and E. coli isolates
Food samples of animal origin (36 of chicken and 10 of pork) were obtained from five local
open-markets and five supermarkets in Puebla City, Mexico, between February and June of
2009. Samples were kept on ice during transport to the laboratory and all of them were
tested within 24 h of collection. One gram of each sample was vigorously homogenized with

3 mL of brain heart infusion (BD Bioxon®) broth supplemented with bacitracin at a
concentration of 20 mg/L and incubated for 18 h at 37°C. Later on, 40 µl of the suspension
was streaked onto Levine agar plates (Oxoid, LTD, England) supplemented with cefotaxime
(2 mg/L) (Sigma-Aldrich®), and incubated for 24 h at 37°C (Ruiz et al., 2012). Isolates with
typical E. coli morphology were selected and identified by classical biochemical methods,
and by the API 20E system (BioMérieux, La Balme Les Grottes, France).

2.2 Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
Antimicrobial susceptibility was performed by the agar disk diffusion method following the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommendations (Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI), 2017), and a total of 21 antimicrobial agents were tested: ampicillin,
amoxicillin–clavulanic, ampicillin-sulbactam, cephalotin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime,
ceftriaxone, cefepime, aztreonam,
imipenem, meropenem, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin,
streptomycin, gentamicin, amikacin, tobramycin, tetracycline, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole
and chloramphenicol (Beckton, Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). E. coli ATCC 25922 was used
as a quality control strain. Strains exhibiting resistance to three or more classes of antibiotics
were defined as multidrug resistant (MDR). Cefotaxime-resistant (CTXR) E. coli isolates (up to
four colonies) were initially selected per sample and the antimicrobial resistance phenotype was
determined. One CTXR E. coli isolate per sample was kept for further studies, except if they
presented different antimicrobial resistance phenotype.

The double disk synergy test with cefotaxime (CTX), ceftazidime (CAZ), aztreonam (ATM)
and cefepime (FEP) in proximity to AMC was used for the screening of ESBL (CLSI, 2017).
The AmpC-phenotype was considered when the strains showed resistance to amoxicillin-
clavulanate (AMC) and cefoxitin (FOX).

2.3 Partial characterization of β-lactamase genes and genetic environment of blaCTX-M genes
Genes encoding TEM, SHV, OXA and CTX-M enzymes, and the genetic environment of
blaCTX-M genes were analyzed by gene-specific PCR and DNA sequencing on both strands
(Rocha-Gracia et al., 2015). Nucleotide segments and their deduced amino acid sequences were
compared with those included in the GenBank database and on the Lahey Clinic website (www.
lahey.org/Studies) in order to confirm the specific β-lactamase gene. The presence of acAmpC
was tested by multiplex PCR in AMC and FOX-resistant strains (Maamar et al., 2016). The
genetic environment of blaCMY-2 gene was also determined by PCR and sequencing (Guo et al.,
2014). The mutation in the promoter/attenuator region of the chromosomal ampC gene was also
analyzed in all AMC and FOX-resistant E. coli isolates by PCR amplification, sequencing and
comparison to the same region of the E. coli K12 (Briñas et al., 2005).

2.4 Detection of genes conferring resistance to non-β-lactam antimicrobial agents and
characterization of class 1 integrons
The presence of genes associated with resistance to tetracycline (tetA and tetB), chloramphenicol
(cmlA), sulphonamide (sul1 and sul3) and quinolones (qnr, qepA and aac(6´)Ib-cr) were
determined by PCR and sequencing (Ruiz et al., 2012; Sáenz et al., 2004; Vinué et al., 2009). gyrA
and parC genes were amplified by PCR and sequencing to determine the amino acid changes.
The obtained sequences were compared with those previously reported for GyrA (GenBank
accession number X06373) and ParC (M58408 with the modification included in L22025)
proteins (Sáenz et al., 2004). The presence of intI1 (encoding class 1 integrase) and the 3
´-conserved region (qacEΔ1- sul1 genes) of class 1 integrons were examined by PCR. The
variable region of class 1 integrons were characterized by PCR (Ruiz et al., 2012), sequencing and
compared with those included in GenBank to identify the gene cassettes. Likewise, the presence
of intI2 (encoding class 2 integrase) was examined by PCR. Positive and negative controls from
the bacterial collection of the University of La Rioja were included in all PCR assays.

2.5 Genetic typing of E. coli strains
Phylogenetic groups were determined using an established multiplex PCR (Clermont et al.,
2013). This method classified E. coli strains into eight phylogenetic groups (A, B1, B2, C, D, E, F
and clade I), based on detection of arpA, chuA, yjaA or TspE4.C2 genes. ESBL- or
CMY-2-producing E. coli isolates were typed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) as
described by Wirth et al. (2006). MLST was performed by PCR amplification of the standard
seven housekeeping loci: adk, fumC, gyrB, icd, mdh, purA and recA. All the amplicons were
sequenced and compared with the MLST database (http://mlst.warwick.ac.uk/mlst/mlst/dbs/
Ecoli) in order to ascertain the corresponding sequence type (ST) and clonal complex (CC).

2.6 Virotyping of E. coli strains
Eleven virulence factor (VF) genes were determined for the CTX-M- or CMY-2-producing E. coli
isolates using an established PCR protocol. This scheme identifies pap (adhesin encoding P
fimbriae), cnfI (cytotoxic necrotizing factor), sat (secreted autotransporter toxin), kpsMII (group 2
capsule synthesis), iroN (catecholate siderophore receptor), afa/draBC (Afa/Dr adhesins), ibeA
(invasion of brain endothelium), hlyA (α hemolysin) and cdtB (cytolethal distending toxin) genes
distributed into five established virotypes of E. coli ST131 (A-E) (Nicolas-Chanoine et al., 2014).

3. Results
3.1 Recovery of CTXR E. coli isolates
E. coli isolates with CTXR phenotype were collected in 28 of 36 chicken samples (78 percent)
and in five of ten pork samples (50 percent) (Table I); 28 of the 33 positive samples were
obtained in markets (24 chicken; 4 pork) and five in supermarkets ( four chicken; one pork).
Four CTXR isolates were initially selected from each positive sample, however, after
bacterial identification, susceptibility testing and PCRs for identification of β-lactamase
genes; as isolates of the same sample looked similar, only one isolate/sample was selected for
further characterization, rendering a collection of 33 CTXR E. coli isolates (Table I). Of this
collection, 16 of them were ESBL-producers (14 of 187 chicken and 2 of pork origin) and
17 were ESBL-negative but AmpC-phenotype positive; eight isolates of this last group
corresponded to the genotype acAmpC and carried the gene encoding CMY-2 (six of chicken
and two of pork origin); taking together, 24 of the 46 food samples tested (52 percent) carried
ESBL or CMY-2-producing E. coli isolates (Table I).

3.2 Characterization of ESBL-positive E. coli strains
Table II shows the characteristics of the 16 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates. All isolates
showed a multiresistant phenotype, exhibiting resistance to tetracycline and nalidixic acid;
and most of them also to ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (n ¼ 14),
streptomycin (n¼ 13), chloramphenicol (n ¼ 12) or gentamicin (n ¼ 10). The β-lactamases
detected among our isolates were (number of 200 isolates): CTX-M-2 (8); CTX-M-1 (2); CTX-
M-15 (1); SHV-2a (4, one of them co-producing CTX-M-2) and TEM-52c (1). Besides, no tested

ß-lactamases

ESBL genes were detected in one isolate with ESBL phenotype (C4424 strain). Five isolates
contained, in addition of ESBL, other types of β-lactamases (TEM-1b, OXA-1 and OXA-2).
A high variety of genetic lineages were detected among the ESBL-producing strains with
the identification of 12 different ST, where three of them were new (ST3377 and ST3379, with
new allelic combinations, and ascribed to B1 and F phylogroups, respectively; ST3498, with a
new mdh allele (290), and associated with phylogroup A). Most of the ESBL-producing isolates
were ascribed to phylogroup B1 (12 strains), although phylogroups A, D, E and F were also
found (one strain each). In total, 12 of 16 ESBL-producing isolates (75 percent) carried class 1
integrons and seven different gene cassette arrays were identified in their variable region
(Table II); six of them corresponded to classic class 1 integrons and one to the sul3-atypical
class 1 integron. Moreover, other genes associated with non-β-lactam resistance were found
(number of strains): sul3 (10), tetA (9, in two of them associated with tetB), and cmlA (6). Four
ESBL-producing strains were positive for type 2 integrase (Table II). Three ESBL-producing
strains contained more than one class 1 integron (Table II).

All 16 isolates but 1 (C3297) presented two amino acid changes in GyrA (S83L+D87N) and
the S80I change in ParC (in three strains associated with E84G) (Table II). On the other hand,
C3297 only presented one amino acid change in GyrA (S83L) and a wild ParC sequence. Six of
the ESBL-positive isolates also presented the phenotype AmpC, although none of them carried
the blaCMY-2 gene or other acAmpC encoding genes. Mutations in ampC promoter/attenuator
region were studied in these six isolates with AmpC-phenotype: one isolate contained mutations
at positions −42, −18, +1 and +58; another isolate had a wild sequence; c) three isolates
presented the mutations −18, +1 and +58; and one strain the mutations −28 and +58 (Table II).

3.3 Characterization of AmpC-positive and ESBL-negative E. coli strains
Table III shows the characteristics of the 17 CTXR E. coli isolates with AmpC-phenotype and
ESBL-negative. Eight of them were CMY-2-producers, and the remaining nine isolates were
negative for all acAmpC β-lactamase genes tested. The strains with the CMY-2 encoding gene,
presented the classical environment (ampR-blaCMY-2-blc) described by Jacoby (2009), but one
strain of chicken origin, which showed an unusual upstream region with IS1 truncating ISEcp1.
Two of the eight CMY-2-producing strains presented mutations in the promoter/attenuator
region of ampC gene (−18, +1 and +58), and the other six showed a wild sequence. All
CMY-2-positive isolates were ascribed to different ST, one of them new (ST3378), and
corresponded to phylogroups: A (3 isolates), B1 (1), B2 (1), D (1), E (1) and F (1). All these strains
showed ciprofloxacin, streptomycin and tetracycline resistance. One of the strains presented the
qnrB10 gene and another one the qnrA1 gene. Five CMY-2-positive strains harbored a classic
class 1 integron (intI1/ qacEΔ1-sul1) showing all of them different gene cassette arrays. Five
CMY-2-producing strains were positive for type 2 integrase (Table III). Besides, all eight CMY-2-
positive strains presented one or two amino acid changes in GyrA and ParC proteins. The nine
strains negative for acAmpC encoding genes, six of them presented mutations in the promoter/
attenuator region of ampC gene (−18, +1, +58 (5 strains); +58 (1 strain)), and the remaining three
strains showed a wild sequence. On the other hand, these strains were ascribed to phylogroups:
B1 (n¼ 4); D (n¼ 3); A (n¼ 1) and 251 C (n¼ 1). Only three of these strains carried class 1
integrons and the aadA(1/2) gene cassette was detected in two of them. Most of the strains
presented amino acid changes 253 in GyrA (n¼ 8) and ParC proteins (n¼ 6) (Table III).

3.4 Virotyping of E. coli strains
In total, 6 of the 19 tested strains were not carriers of VF, so they were classified as Virotype
0; nevertheless, we identified eight virotypes (A–H) where only virotype B may correspond
to the same virotype in E. coli ST131 (detected in three strains with CMY-2), ten strains were
grouped in seven defined virotypes (A, C–H). It is remarkable that 1 strain (C3315) harbored
4 of the 11 VF (Table IV).

4. Discussion
ESBL-producing bacteria could spread through different sources; there are studies that
report that ESBL-carrying E. coli of animal origin can disseminate via the food chain or
water worldwide (Kluytmans et al., 2013; Leverstein-van Hall et al., 2011; Meunier et al.,
2006); nevertheless, few data do exist so far about the prevalence of ESBL or acAmpC
producing E. coli isolates in food samples of animal origin for human consumption in Latin
America (Bevan et al., 2017), and these data are almost lacking in Mexico. Our study shows
that more than half of the food samples analyzed, carried E. coli isolates producers of ESBL
(35 percent) or acAmpC, concretely CMY-2 (17 percent). Moreover, the prevalence of ESBL-
producing E. coli isolates was higher among chicken samples (39 percent) than among pork
samples (20 percent).

Half of the ESBL-positive isolates contained the blaCTX-M2 gene. This gene is unusual
among E. coli isolates in Europe but it is more frequent in Latin America (Bevan et al.,
2017). Several Brazilian reports detected CTX-M-2 as predominant ESBL in E. coli
obtained from chicken meat (Bonelli et al., 2014; Botelho et al., 2015; Casella et al., 2015;
Ferreira et al., 2014). Moreover, in a study carried out in Sweden, CTX-M-2-producing
E. coli strains were detected in broiler meat samples from South America (Egervärn et al.,
2014), suggesting the specific endemic situation of this ESBL. The presence among food
samples of two CTX-M-1-positive E. coli strains ( frequent in Europe and Magreb (Alonso
et al., 2017; Jouini et al., 2013)), and of a CTX-M-15-producer strain of lineage ST617-B1 and
that also carried ibeA gene, is relevant. The epidemic clone E. coli ST131-B2/CTX-M15 has
been disseminated in clinical settings worldwide (Ranjan et al., 2015), but it seems that
other clones harboring CTX-M-15 could be also spreading in other ecosystems; such as the
clone ST617-B1, detected in a chicken sample in this study, and also in a healthy dog in a
previous report in Mexico (Rocha-Gracia et al., 2015).

The detection of four strains producers of SHV-2a (one of them together with CTX-M-2)
is of relevance; SHV-2a and SHV-2 are persisting ESBL in E. coli from food samples in
Canada, particular in those of chicken origin (Pouget et al., 2013). Most of our
SHV-2a-positive strains of chicken origin carried a class 1 integron with aadA1 as gene
cassette (streptomycin resistance), similar to previous data (Pouget et al., 2013). On the
other hand, a chicken sample was contaminated with a TEM-52c-producer E. coli strain
(1/16, 6.2 percent). This type of ESBL has also been detected in low frequency in broiler
chickens and turkey’s meat in Great Britain (0.5–1.3 percent) (Randall et al., 2011), or in
piglets with post-weaning diarrhea in China province (2.6 percent) (Xu et al., 2015), and
more frequently in diverse E. coli clones from different piggeries in Portugal (59 percent)
296 (Rodrígues et al., 2013). To our knowledge, this is first report of the blaTEM-52c gene
in chicken meat E. coli isolates in Mexico.

In this study, the high rate of samples contaminated with CMY-2-producing E. coli strains
(17 percent) is surprising, higher than in studies performed in food or food-producing animals
in Africa or Europe (Ben Sallem et al., 2014; Liebana et al., 2013). Additionally, six of these
CMY-2-producing strains carry some virulence genes (Table IV). Curiously, in other study
realized in UK, CMY-type enzymes are a very frequent mechanism of resistance (42 percent)
among oxymino-cephalosporin-resistant E. coli isolates obtained of raw chicken samples of
South American origin (Dhanji et al., 2010). In Mexico, there is only one previous study in

which a CMY-producing E. coli strain is detected in one bovine meat sample (Aguilar-Montes
de Oca et al., 2015), without reporting the CMY variant. On the other hand, Zaidi et al. (2007)
reported the detection of CMY-2 in Salmonella Typhimurium isolated from samples of retail
meat and food animal intestines in Yucatan, Mexico, with a frequency of 3.9 percent in retail
chicken and 7.4 percent in swine intestine. Moreover, prevalence CMY-2-producing E. coli
strains of 11 and 9.8 percent were reported in healthy dogs and in cloacal samples of healthy
turtles,
in Mexico, respectively (Rocha-Gracia et al., 2015; Cortés-Cortés et al., 2016).
Interestingly, since 2010 in Mexico the free sale of antibiotics in drugstores was regularized;
however, the use of antibiotics as promoters of animal growth has not been legislated. The
high variety of ST (with four new ones) and high carriage of virulence genes detected among
the ESBL- and CMY-2-producing E. coli strains indicate that the dissemination of this
resistance do not correspond to a specific clone but to different strains that could share similar
plasmids. However, most of the ESBL- or CMY-2-producing isolates were typed as
phylogroup B1 or A, respectively. Phylogroup B2, frequent among clinical isolates, was only
detected in one CMY-2-positive E. coli isolate of chicken origin that corresponded to the lineage
ST224, and carried the qnrA1 gene. This ST has been reported in E. coli strains isolated from
human (non-pathogenic/pathogenic strain), chicken and horse (both pathogenic) (Alonso et al.,
2016; Silva et al., 2016; Aizawa et al., 2014), which indicates its wide distribution and easy
spread; in our case carrying classes 1 and 2 integrons (Table III).

The high content of resistance genes for non-β-lactam antibiotics (Tables II and III)
and the presence of amino acid changes in GyrA and ParC proteins in our ESBL or
CMY-2-positive strains is of concern due to the potential difficulties of therapeutic options in
case of being implicated in human infections.

Interestingly, since 2010 in Mexico the free sale of antibiotics in drugstores was
regularized; however, the use of antibiotics as animal growth promoters has not been
legislated (Dreser et al., 2012). Multidrug resistant E. coli isolates may act as reservoirs for
intra- and inter-species exchange and thereby a source for spread of multidrug-resistant
determinants. Food samples could get contaminated by these strains during animal slaughter.
Furthermore, other points of the food chain (markets, supermarkets and others) could also be a
source for contamination (Szmolka and Nagy, 2013). Moreover, during handling of meat in
markets and supermarkets, susceptible human might acquire multidrug-resistant E. coli
strains, either by direct contact or through the environment which could be relevant to human
medicine. In addition, sanitation problems, inadequate and unsanitary handling of food of
animal origin, pet defecation outdoors, socioeconomic factors and environmental (air and
water), could contribute to increase the presence of ESBL or acAmpC-enzyme-E. coli strains
(Ljungquist et al., 2016; Baede et al., 2015). Also, contaminated food could be a source of
resistant bacteria, at the kitchen level, for other food or for humans. All of the above leads us
to recommend activities to improve surveillance and monitoring of food control in open-
markets and supermarkets since the human could acquire MDR E. coli strains by cross-
contamination, establishing in the intestinal microbiota with implications in the public health.
It have been suggested that ExPEC (Extra intestinal Pathogenic E. coli) is defined by the
presence of X2 VF genes among pap, sfa, afa/draBC, iutA and kpsMTII ( Johnson and Stell,
2000) and the virotype the strains belong to is important to infer the distribution of VF and the
potential of damage that the pathogenic strain could deploy to the host cell; this scheme was
originally proposed for E. coli ST131 since this clone is widespread and harbor genetic
determinants of resistance and virulence (Nicolas-Chanoine et al., 2014). Here, we detected 13
ESBL or acAmpC-enzyme-E. coli strains harboring VF genes previously reported in
pathogenic ST131 E. coli strains; interestingly, virotype B-E. coli ST131 was detected in one
strain and seven new virotypes were obtained. It highlights the importance of VF genes
distribution worldwide that can be placed into Mobilizable Genetic Elements which also can
harbor resistance determinants;
interestingly, three CMY-2 and one CTX-M-2 producer

gene, which has been implied in brain endothelium invasion; otherwise, C3321 harbors cdtB
gene, a cytolethal distention toxin; these genetic determinants may fit up the strains to be
more aggressive, which could compromise intestinal stability leading to states of dysbiosis
with the complications involved.

In conclusion, the high rate of ESBL and CMY-2-producing E. coli and some with
virulence genes, in the food chain, represent an important problem of public health, acting as
source for the spread of MDR determinants and/or VFs from contaminated food of animal
origin to humans. In countries, like ours, it is necessary to monitor the food-producing
animals for the presence of MDR bacteria, enhance the hygiene in food practices to limit the
spread of these microorganisms and to promote the prudent use of antibiotics in animals
and to limit its use as animal growth promoters.
