1  The Colistin Resistance Gene, mcr-1, is Prevalent in Commensal E. coli Isolated from 1 Lebanese Pre-harvest Poultry 2 Zaynab Hmede1 and Issmat I.

Kassem, PHD; E-mail: ik12@osu.edu; Phone:  +961 1 350000 6 Ext: 4456; Fax: Fax: +961 1 744460.  7 Lebanon 8 Antimicrobial resistance is a serious global problem. However, antimicrobial stewardship 9 remains deficient in Lebanon (1). National antimicrobial resistance monitoring programs are 10 lacking with negligible attention to agricultural practices, and data are largely restricted to a few 11 clinical studies (1). Notably, colistin (polymyxin E) resistance was recently detected in clinical 12 settings in Lebanon, while the antibiotic is promoted to control diseases in Lebanese poultry 13 (1,2). Since the use of colistin against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria is jeopardized 14 by the proliferation of the plasmid-borne mobile-colistin-resistance gene (mcr-1), we 15 investigated the potential emergence of colistin resistance on Lebanese poultry farms. For this 16 purpose, fresh fecal samples (n = 93) were collected from three major Lebanese broiler chicken 17 farms (31 samples per farm) between September 2017 and March 2018. All samples were 18 screened on an E. coli selective medium, RAPID'E.coli 2 Agar (Bio-Rad, USA), which was 19 supplemented with 4 μg/ml colistin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Our results showed that 90 samples 20 (97%) yielded E. coli colonies (~ 80 - 104 CFUs per g fecal matter). Ninety E. coli (31, 30, and 21 29 isolates from the three farms, respectively) were further purified and screened to determine: 22 l

2  1) the colistin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using the broth microdilution method 23 and 2) the presence of mcr-1 and an E. coli-specific 16S rRNA gene fragment using PCR (3,4).  24 Our results showed that the colistin MIC ranged between 8-32 μg/ml. All the isolates were 25 positive for the 16S rRNA gene, while 88 isolates (~ 98%) harbored mcr-1, which was further 26 confirmed by sequencing (GenBank accession numbers: MH759759-MH759761). PCR analysis 27 showed that the two mcr-1-negative isolates did not harbor mcr-2 or mcr-3 (5,6). Antimicrobial 28 susceptibility analysis using the disk diffusion assay (7) showed that the mcr-1-positive E. coli 29 were also resistant to penicillin (100%), ampicillin (100% of isolates), amoxicillin + calvulanic 30 acid (56%), cefepime (25%), cefotaxime (70%), cephalexin (94%), cefixime (76%), doripenem 31 (1%), imipenem (1%), meropenem (2%), gentamicin (61%), kanamycin (76%), streptomycin 32 (80%), tetracycline (89%), ciprofloxacin (91%), norfloxacin (68%), trimethoprim-33 sulfamethoxazole (84%), and chloramphenicol (95%).  All the tested isolates were multidrug-34 resistant; exhibiting resistance to 4 or more classes of antimicrobials (Table S1). PCR analysis 35 showed that 99%, 96% and 35.5% of the isolates were positive for Class 1 Integrons (Integ), 36 blaTEM and blaCTX-M (extended-spectrum β-lactamase genes), respectively (8). Taken together, 37 our results showed a wide-spread resistance to colistin and other important antimicrobials in E. 38 coli from Lebanese poultry. mcr-1 was also prevalent in these isolates. In the few previous 39 studies in the Middle-East, mcr-1 was detected in clinical E. coli from Bahrain (n = 2 of seventy-40 five colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains), Saudi Arabia (n = 1), and the United Arab 41 Emirates (n = 1), while 14 (15.6%) isolates were associated with broiler chickens in Qatar (9,10). 42 While plasmid mediated colistin resistance has increased in the food chain globally (11), 43 resistance in Lebanon might be among the highest reported incidences. Therefore, there is a 44 peremptory national need to revisit antimicrobial stewardship and agricultural practices in order 45 l
