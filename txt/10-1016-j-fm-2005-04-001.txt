Abstract

A study was conducted to determine the incidence of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis and other Salmonella serovars on
eggshell, egg contents and on egg-storing trays. A total of 492 eggs and 82 egg-storing trays were examined over a period of 1 year
from different retail outlets of a residential area of Coimbatore city, South India. Salmonella contamination was recorded in 38 of
492 (7.7%) eggs out of which 29 was in eggshell (5.9%) and 9 in egg contents (1.8%). Around 7.5% of the egg-storing trays were also
found to be contaminated with Salmonella. Serotyping of the Salmonella strains showed that 89.7% of the strains from eggshell,
100% of the strains from egg contents and 71.4% of the strains from egg-storing trays were Salmonella Enteritidis. Other
serovarvars encountered were S. Cerro, S. Molade and S. Mbandaka from eggshell and S. Cerro from egg-storing trays. Seasonal
variations in the prevalence pattern were identiﬁed with, a higher prevalence during monsoon months followed by post-monsoon
and premonsoon. Further examination of the Salmonella strains was carried out by testing their antimicrobial sensitivity against 10
commonly used antimicrobials. Results revealed high prevalence of multiple antimicrobial resistance among these strains suggesting
possible prior selection by use of antimicrobials in egg production.

1. Introduction

Salmonellosis is a most prevalent foodborne disease in
many countries world-wide and it has been estimated
that approximately 1.4 million cases were reported
annually in the developed nations such as USA (Mead
et al., 1999). The organism has been isolated from a
range of foods in almost every country in which it has
been investigated. Typical foodstuffs from which Sal-

monella has been isolated include swine and poultry-
meat, poultry products and dairy products. (Gebreyes et
al., 2000; Rajashekara et al., 2000). Salmonella Enter-
itidis is considered to be an important human pathogen
worldwide and there has been a dramatic increase in
human S. Enteritidis infections in the last decade. The
consumption of eggs or egg containing foods has been
associated with high percentage of many human S.
Enteritidis outbreaks.

In recent years, concern about poultry, meats and
other foodstuffs contaminated with foodborne patho-
gens has gained considerable attention because of the
increased incidence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria
associated with human illness (CDC, 1997; Davies et al.,

1999; Breuil et al., 2000). A high prevalence of
antimicrobial resistant Salmonella in broiler chicken
and foods of animal origin has been reported earlier
from India (Hatha and Lakshmanaperumalsamy, 1995;
Suresh et al., 2000). During the last few years, the
National Egg Co-ordination Committee (NECC), Govt.
of India has taken steps to promote egg as a source of
good quality protein and the consumption of egg has
gone up considerably. There are mass production
centres in various parts of the country especially in
southern states, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.
Though the consumption has been promoted, no
effective steps are taken to monitor the quality of the
egg reaching the market and no guidelines have been
prescribed for the storage of eggs in retail markets. The
present study has been taken up primarily to assess the
level of Salmonella contamination in egg with special
reference to S. Enteritidis, as it has been reported that
egg-associated salmonellosis is a pandemic (Rodrigue
et al., 1990). Further characterization of the isolated
Salmonella strains was also carried out and the
seasonality in incidence pattern has been investigated.

2. Methods

2.1. Sample collection

Eggs were collected randomly from different outlets,
in a residential area of Coimbatore city, over a period of
1-year (June 1997–May 1998). A total of 492 eggshells,
492 egg content and 82 egg-storing trays were analysed
for the presence of Salmonella.

2.2. Bacteriological methods

Unwashed eggs were collected in sterile polythene
bags and transported to the laboratory. The surfaces of
egg trays were swabbed on the spot and the samples
were transported to laboratory in buffered peptone
water (BPW, Himedia, Bombay). Aseptic procedures
were strictly adopted during collection of samples. To
study the seasonal variation in the prevalence of
Salmonella, the study period was divided into premon-
soon (February–May), Monsoon (June–September) and
post-monsoon (October–January).

Swab technique was used to sample the shell surface
of the intact eggs and egg-storing trays. Sterile cotton
swabs dipped in sterile BPW were used to swab the
entire surface area of the eggshell and the area to
keep one egg in an egg-storing tray. For isolation of
Salmonella, modiﬁed method of Hatha and Lakshma-
naperumalsamy (1997) was used, the preenrichment
medium lactose broth was replaced with BPW. The
swabs were directly inoculated into 10 ml BPW in screw-
capped bottles and incubated at 37 1C for 24 h.

In order to collect the egg contents, eggs were surface
sterilized by immersion in 70% alcohol
for 2 min,
air dried in a sterile chamber for 10 min then cracked
with a sterile knife. Each egg’s content was mixed
thoroughly and 25 ml of
the mixed egg content
was inoculated into 225 ml of BPW and incubated
at 37 1C for 24 h. After preenrichment, 1 ml of the
cultures of all sample types were transferred to 9 ml of
tetrathionate broth (Himedia, Bombay) and to 9 ml of
selenite cystine broth (Himedia, Bombay) and incubated
at 37 1C for 24 h for selective enrichment. The cultures
were then streaked onto xylose lysine deoxycholate
(Himedia, Bombay) agar, brilliant green agar (Himedia,
Bombay) and hektoen enteric agar (Himedia, Bombay)
and incubated at 37 1C for 24–48 h. The plates were
observed for typical Salmonella-like colonies, and two
colonies per plate were picked, puriﬁed and subjected
to primary biochemical screening which involved reac-
tions on triple sugar iron (Himedia, Bombay) agar,
lysine iron agar (Himedia, Bombay), indole production
in tryptone broth (Himedia, Bombay) and urea splitting
ability in Christesen’s urea agar (Himedia, Bombay).
Cultures that matched typical reactions of Salmonella in
preliminary screening were further subjected to carbo-
hydrate utilization involving lactose, sucrose, dulcitol
and salicin and further conﬁrmed by slide agglutination
test using polyvalent O sera (Wellcome laboratories,
England). The conﬁrmed strains were serotyped at
National Salmonella and Escherichia Centre, Govt. of
India Central Research Institute, Kasauli, Himachal
Pradesh.

2.3. Antimicrobial sensitivity testing

Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were carried out by
the disk diffusion method (Bauer et al., 1966). Anti-
microbials used, and their concentrations are as follows:
Ampicillin (10 mcg); Chloramphenicol (30 mcg); Cipro-
ﬂoxacin (10 mcg); Gentamycin (10 mcg); Kanamycin
(30 mcg); Nalidixic adid (30 mcg); Neomycin (30 mcg);
Polymixin B (300 units); Sulphamethoxazole (25 mcg)
and Tetracycline (30 mcg). All the antimicrobial disks
were purchased from Himedia, Bombay.

Pure cultures of Salmonella serovars were enriched
infusion broth at 37 1C for 6–8 h.
in brain–heart
These cultures were then streaked over Mueller Hinton
agar plates (Himedia, Bombay) using a sterile cotton
swab. The antibiotic discs were dispensed using a
disc dispenser (Himedia, Bombay) sufﬁciently separated
from each other so as to avoid overlapping of inhibi-
tion zones. After 30 min the plates were inverted
and incubated at 37 1C for 16–18 h. Results were
recorded by measuring the diameter of the inhibition
zones and compared with the
chart
of performance standards for antimicrobial disk sus-
ceptibility tests, supplied by the Himedia laboratories,

3.1. Incidence of Salmonella in eggs and egg-storing trays

Eggshell

492

30 (6.1)a

(1989)

The results of Salmonella incidence in marketed eggs
and commercial egg-storing trays are shown in Table 1.
Salmonella contamination was recorded in 6.1% of
eggshells and 1.8% of egg contents. Salmonella con-
tamination was also recorded in 7 (8.5%) of 82 egg
trays. The incidence levels of S. Enteritidis in eggshell
reported earlier were variable. In Spain, Perales and
Audicana,
reported around 1% Salmonella
contamination. In the United Kingdom prevalence
levels were reported to be varying from zero (Mawer
et al., 1989) to 7% (Humphrey, 1994a, b, Evans et al.,
1998). The prevalence level in the present investigation is
slightly higher than these observations. It may be noted
that an average consumer in India is not very aware of
the consequences of
food-poisoning and often the
producers and retailers take advantage of the situation.
The eggs are not well scrubbed and they are sold fresh
from the production facility. This results in the presence
of faecal matter on the eggshell and resultant presence of
pathogen if the hen is excreting Salmonella. Also the
eggs are stored at room temperature, which again helps
mesophiles to multiply fast if they get access to egg
content
through cracks which can develop during
transportation and handling.

The results clearly indicate that S. Enteritidis was the
most frequently isolated (86.7%) serovar on the eggshell
along with other 3 serovars, such as S. Cerro (6.7%), S.
Mbandaka (3.3%) and S. Molade (3.3%). In the present
investigation, egg contents were contaminated only by
S. Enteritidis and other serovars of Salmonella spp.
isolated from the eggshells were not recovered in the egg
contents. The results of this study suggests that not all
the eggs with shell contamination had their contents
contaminated but all the eggs contaminated with S.
Enteritidis in their content had contamination on their
shells. The contamination recorded in eggs content was
only by S. Enteritidis and no other serovars were
isolated from the egg content. This is indicative of
transovarial route of contamination by S. Enteritidis.
One of
the eggshells was found to have both S.
Enteritidis and S. Mbandaka. It is reported that the
contamination of egg contents with S. Enteritidis is
predominantly the result of infection of the reproductive
tissue rather than passage through the shell after lay
(Humphrey, 1994a, b). There was no association be-
tween shell contamination and the presence of S.
Enteritidis of egg content laid by naturally infected hens
(Mawer et al., 1989; Humphrey et al., 1989, 1991).

3.2. Seasonal variation in incidence pattern

Variation was recorded in the prevalence of Salmo-
nella in different seasons of the study period (Table 2).
The results show that incidence of Salmonella was
higher in the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. The
results were subjected to signiﬁcance testing using chi-
square which revealed that there were no signiﬁcant
variation in the incidence levels during different seasons
(Po0:233). Feachem (1974) and Goyal et al. (1977)
reported that a reduced temperature is preferred by
many pathogens. Survival of Salmonella on eggshells is
enhanced by high relative humidity and low temperature
(Lancaster and Crabb, 1953; Baker, 1990), which is well-
marked feature during the monsoon and post-monsoon
months. High temperature results
in the reduced
prevalence during the premonsoon. Baker (1990), who
observed that Salmonella on eggshells die rapidly at high
temperatures during storage reported similar results.
High temperature ranging from 28 to 34 1C is a
characteristic feature of premonsoon seasons in the
study area, compared to 20–25 1C during post-monsoon
season. Prevalence of Salmonella in egg content did not
follow the seasonal variation trend as recorded in
eggshells and increased prevalence was recorded in the
premonsoon season, possibly due to higher levels of
multiplication in higher temperatures.

3.3. Antimicrobial resistance patterns

The results of antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella
strains isolated from both eggs and egg-storing trays
are given in Table 3. The results revealed that all the
strains from egg and egg-storing trays were resistant to
ampicillin, neomycin, polymyxin-B and tetracycline.
Though none of the Salmonella strains from eggs and

egg-storing trays were resistant against chloramphenicol
and gentamicin, they differed in their resistance level to
ciproﬂoxacin as 8.9% of the strains from eggs were
resistant and none of those from egg-storing trays
showed any resistance. There was no signiﬁcant varia-
tion in resistance levels among Salmonella strains from
eggs and egg-storing trays.

In poultry, the antimicrobial tetracycline is used in
day-old poults and chicks as a single injection, or
administered via the drinking water to control infection
by Salmonella, Escherichia coli and Mycoplasma (Lucas
et al., 1970; Cassell, 1981; Hamdy et al., 1982).
Ampicillin-resistant strains isolated from eggs were in
higher proportion than from the broiler chickens and
environmental samples from India (Suresh et al., 2000).
Resistance to ciproﬂoxacin and sulphamethoxazole was
recorded relatively at lower proportions. Ciproﬂoxacin
is a ﬂuoroquinolone antimicrobial that is increasingly
and successfully used for the treatment of septicemic
salmonellosis in humans (Brown et al., 1994; Griggs
et al., 1994). Ciproﬂoxacin resistance in human and
veterinary Salmonella isolates has occasionally been
found (Brown et al., 1994). All the strains isolated from
egg and egg-storing trays were found to be resistant to
neomycin, tetracycline and ampicillin. Tetracycline has
been used to treat day-old chickens, which might have
resulted in the emergence of
tetracycline resistant
Salmonella in the layer and broiler ﬂocks (Ekperigin
et al., 1983; Williams, 1984).

aFigures in the parenthesis indicate the number of serovars with

similar resistance pattern.

The resistance patterns encountered among Salmo-
nella serovars from different sources is represented in
Table 4. The results indicated six different patterns of
resistance among the Salmonella strains from egg and 3
different patterns among the Salmonella strains from
egg-storing trays. The Salmonella strains having similar
level of resistance and resistance pattern indicates their
origin from a common source. The logical interpretation
of the results of the MAR index is that all Salmonella
stains isolated in the study showed that the strains might
have originated from environments where antimicro-
bials are often used. Poultry, one of the major reservoirs
of Salmonella species, are considered to be a high-risk
source of Salmonella species. There is a large body of
literature reviewed by Novick (1981) demonstrating that
the sub-therapeutic and therapeutic use of antimicro-
bials in the mass production of poultry, eggs and
pork has promoted the emergence and maintenance of
MAR pathogenic bacteria in the environments of these
animals. Also ongoing infection with S. Enteritidis and
use of medication at breeder level could considerably
increase the prevalence of multiple resistant S. Enter-
itidis in poultry rearing environment.

Control measures, which could be applied at a
number of points from farm to home which might limit
the risk to public health from infection of laying hens
with S. Enteritidis and the associated contamination
of eggs have been recommended by several authors.
On-farm measures such as regular testing of birds, faecal

material, applying serological testing methods to detect
S. Enteritidis, eliminating environmental contamination
before replacement of new birds, providing contamina-
tion free feed, frequent egg collection and improved
hatchery hygiene, oral administration of cultured caecal
contents from an appropriate donor bird to re-establish-
ing a mature gut ﬂora and chlorination of drinking
water could be practised to reduce Salmonella contam-
ination. The speciﬁc recommendations considering the
Indian scenario involves better temperature control of
eggs at retail and catering outlets, thorough cleaning of
the shell eggs before marketing and monitoring the
availability of cracked eggs from retail stores merits due
consideration. The results of the present study indicate
that S. Enteritidis contaminated eggs are common in the
Indian retail market. The multiple antimicrobial-resis-
tant nature of
the organism adds to the gravity
the problem. Also the reuse of egg trays and
of
use as play things by children could pose potential risk.
As the results from this single investigation are not
sufﬁcient for formulating standards by the regulatory
agencies, more large-scale studies are required to
quantify the situation on a national basis. Along with
the promotion of the egg as complete food consumer
awareness programmes related to health risk may also
be imparted by the regulatory agencies of government of
India.
