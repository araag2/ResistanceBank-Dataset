Abstract 
Background:  The global incidence of foodborne infections and antibiotic resistance is recently increased and con‑
sidered of public health concern. Currently, scarcely information is available on foodborne infections and ESBL associ‑
ated with poultry and beef meat in Egypt.
Methods:  In total, 180 chicken and beef meat samples as well as internal organs were collected from different 
districts in northern Egypt. The samples were investigated for the prevalence and antibiotic resistance of Salmonella 
enterica serovars and Escherichia coli. All isolates were investigated for harbouring class 1 and class 2 integrons.
Results:  Out of 180 investigated samples 15 S. enterica (8.3%) and 21 E. coli (11.7%) were isolated and identified. 
S. enterica isolates were typed as 9 S. Typhimurium (60.0%), 3 S. Paratyphi A (20.0%), 2 S. Enteritidis (13.3%) and 1 S. 
Kentucky (6.7%). Twenty‑one E. coli isolates were serotyped into O1, O18, O20, O78, O103, O119, O126, O145, O146 
and O158. The phenotypic antibiotic resistance profiles of S. enterica serovars to ampicillin, cefotaxime, cefpodoxime, 
trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole and tetracycline were 86.7, 80.0, 60.0, 53.3 and 40.0%, respectively. Isolated E. coli 
were resistant to tetracycline (80.9%), ampicillin (71.4%), streptomycin, trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (61.9% 
for each) and cefotaxime (33.3%). The dissemination of genes coding for ESBL and AmpC β‑lactamase in S. enterica 
isolates included blaCTX‑M (73.3%), blaTEM (73.3%) and blaCMY (13.3%). In E. coli isolates blaTEM, blaCTX‑M and blaOXA were 
identified in 52.4, 42.9 and 14.3%, respectively. The plasmid‑mediated quinolone resistance genes identified in S. 
enterica were qnrA (33.3%), qnrB (20.0%) and qnrS (6.7%) while qnrA and qnrB were detected in 33.3% of E. coli isolates. 
Class 1 integron was detected in 13.3% of S. enterica and in 14.3% of E. coli isolates. Class 2 integron as well as the 
colistin resistance gene mcr‑1 was not found in any of E. coli or S. enterica isolates.
Conclusions:  This study showed high prevalence of S. enterica and E. coli as foodborne pathogens in raw chicken and 
beef meat in Nile Delta, Egypt. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance in S. enterica and E. coli isolates is of public 
health concern in Egypt. Molecular biological investigation elucidated the presence of genes associated with antibi‑
otic resistance as well as class 1 integron in S. enterica and E. coli.

Background
In spite of the improved technology and hygienic prac-
tices in developed countries at all stages of poultry and 
beef meat production, foodborne infections remain as a 
continuous threat to human and animal health. Escheri-
chia  (E.)  coli  and  S.  enterica  serovars  are  the  dominant 
members of Enterobacteriaceae causing foodborne infec-
tions. The expansion of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is 
also an emerging public health hazard due to the com-
promised efficacy in the treatment of infectious diseases 
[1].

The  continuous  exposure  of  bacterial  strains  by 
β-lactams  has  led  to  dynamic  and  massive  production 
and  mutation  of  β-lactamases  [2].  Extended-spectrum 
β-lactamases (ESBLs) are derived from point mutations 
in  the  blaTEM-1  and  blaSHV-1  β-lactamase  genes,  which 
cannot hydrolyse cephamycins and are inhibited by cla-
vulanic  acid  [3],  while  ampicillin  class  C  β-lactamase 
(AmpC)  enzymes  are  active  on  cephamycins  as  well  as 
oxyiminocephalosporins  and  monobactams  [4].  ESBLs 
are mostly located on mobile genetic elements (plasmids 
or  integrons),  which  can  facilitate  their  mobility  from 
bacterial species to others by horizontal gene transfer [5].
In  Egypt,  Salmonella  isolates  from  chicken  meat  and 
organs  showed  high  resistance  to  different  antibiotic 
classes  [6–8]  where  also,  ESBL-producing  E.  coli  were 
isolated from retail chicken meat and dairy products in 
Egypt [9, 10].

Quinolones considered as drugs of choice for treatment 
of human infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria. 
However,  resistance  to  quinolones  has  been  emerged 
over the time due to misuse and/or overdose of drugs in 
human  and  veterinary  practice  [11].  Plasmid-mediated 
quinolone resistance (PMQR) represented by quinolone 
resistance (qnr) genes is widely distributed among bacte-
ria [12–14].

resistance determinants by integrons stimulates the rapid 
evolution of multidrug resistances (MDR) among Gram-
negative bacteria [16]. Among five main integron classes, 
integrons  1  and  2  are  most  frequent  in  Gram-negative 
bacteria.  More  than  70  different  antibiotic  resistance 
genes have been characterized within integrons [16].

Colistin  as  antimicrobial  substance  was  used  against 
Gram-negative bacteria. Its usage has been limited due to 
its systemic toxicity but it was re-introduced as a last-line 
option in treatment of human infections [17, 18].

This  study  aimed  to  discuss  the  prevalence,  serotyp-
ing,  antibiotic  resistance  and  characterization  of  resist-
ance-associated genes in S. enterica serovars and E. coli 
isolated from beef and poultry meat products in the Nile 
Delta, Egypt.

Methods
Sampling, isolation and identification of bacteria
One  hundred  and  eighty  samples  were  randomly  col-
lected  aseptically  (90  chicken  and  90  beef  meat  and 
organs)  from  slaughterhouses  and  markets  in  four  dis-
tricts  in  northern  Egypt  (Dakahlia,  Damietta,  Kafr  El-
Sheikh  and  Gharbia  governorates).  Briefly,  30  samples 
of freshly slaughtered chickens and 30 samples of native 
frozen chickens from restaurants and supermarkets (each 
15  from  breast  and  from  thigh  muscles  and  skin)  were 
taken. Thirty samples of organs (gizzard and liver) were 
collected from freshly slaughtered chickens. In addition, 
30  beef  meat  samples  of  freshly  slaughtered  carcasses 
(neck,  brisket,  flank  and  rump  muscles)  were  obtained 
from slaughterhouses. Thirty samples from locally frozen 
beef meat, collected from supermarkets and restaurants 
and  30  samples  from  organs  (liver,  spleen  and  heart) 
from freshly slaughtered animals were used in this study 
(Tables 1, 2). 

Ten grams of each meat and organ sample were incised 
using  sterile  scalpel  and  forceps,  transported  immedi-
ately to the laboratory in ice bags, then transferred into 
sterile  homogenizer  flask  containing  45  ml  of  nutri-
ent  broth  (Oxoid,  Manchester,  UK).  The  mixture  was 

Integrons  are  genetic  elements  able  to  capture  indi-
vidual antibiotic resistance genes including β-lactamases 
encoding  genes  and  stimulate  their  transcription  and 
expression  [15].  The  capture  and  spread  of  antibiotic

allowed to stand for 15 min at room temperature. From 
each sample, 1 ml was added to 9 ml of buffered peptone 
water (Oxoid) for E. coli cultivation and 9 ml of Rappa-
port–Vassiliadis  broth  (Oxoid)  for  S.  enterica  isolation. 
After  aerobic  incubation  at  37  °C  overnight,  a  loop-
ful  from  Rappaport–Vassiliadis  broth  was  streaked  on 
xylose lysine deoxycholate (XLD) agar (Oxoid) and from 
buffered peptone water on eosin methylene blue (EMB) 
agar (Oxoid). The inoculated plates were incubated aer-
obically  at  37  °C  for  18–24  h.  Suspected  colonies  were 
identified  biochemically  using  API  20E  (bioMérieux, 
Marcy-l’Étoile, France).

All biochemically confirmed Salmonella isolates were 
serotyped on the basis of somatic (O) and flagellar (H) 
antigens  by  slide  agglutination  test  using  commercial 
antisera (SIFIN, Berlin, Germany) following Kauffman–
White scheme [19]. Serological identification of E. coli 
was carried out using slide agglutination method using 
commercial  antisera  (SIFIN).  The  serotyping  was  car-
ried out at the Serology Unit, Animal Health Research 
Institute,  Dokki,  Egypt,  and  the  Bacteriology  Labora-
tory, Central Laboratories of Ministry of Health, Cairo, 
Egypt.

DNA extraction and purification
The identified bacterial cultures were cultivated in Luria–
Bertani (LB) broth (Oxoid) at 37 °C overnight. DNA was 
extracted  and  purified  using  DNeasy  Blood  and  Tissue 
Kits  (Qiagen,  Manchester,  UK)  according  to  the  manu-
facturer’s instructions.

Molecular identification of S. enterica serovars and E. coli
The isolated strains were further identified as S. enterica 
and  E.  coli  using  PCR  assays.  The  amplification  targets 
and  primers  (Eurofins,  Yokohama,  Japan)  are  listed  in 

Table  3.  All  phenotypically  identified  S.  enterica  sero-
vars were tested for harbouring ompC gene. Isolated E. 
coli were confirmed by species-specific PCR targeting the 
16S rRNA genes and resulting in a 585 bp amplicon. PCR 
assays used in this study resulted in Salmonella, S. Ente-
ritidis and S. Typhimurium specific products of 204, 304 
and 401 bp length, respectively.

The PCR protocol consisted of the following steps: (i) 
an initial denaturation step of 2 min at 95 °C; (ii) 30 cycles 
with 1 cycle consisting of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 57 °C, 
and  2  min  at  72  °C;  and  (iii)  a  final  elongation  step  of 
5 min at 72 °C.

Five-microliter aliquots of reaction mixture were run in 
electrophoreses  using  1.5%  agarose  gels  (Nippon  Gene, 
Tokyo, Japan) and visualized under UV light after ethid-
ium bromide staining.

Determination of antimicrobial susceptibility profiles
The  antimicrobial  susceptibility  was  determined  using 
the Kirby–Bauer disc diffusion test [20]. Briefly, one col-
ony picked up, streaked on Mueller–Hinton blood agar 
(Oxoid) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Bacterial col-
onies were suspended in 0.9% NaCl to obtain a McFar-
land turbidity of 0.5 (Dr. Lange, photometer CADAS 30, 
Berlin, Germany) containing 1–2  × 108 colony-forming 
units (CFU)/ml of E. coli strain ATCC 25922. Three hun-
dred μl of the suspension were spread onto the surface of 
a Mueller–Hinton agar plate (Oxoid) using a sterile swab. 
The antimicrobial discs (Oxoid) of thirteen clinically used 
antibiotics, which are used in the Egyptian poultry and 
cattle farms (Tables 4, 5) were distributed onto the sur-
face of the Mueller–Hinton agar plates using a multi-disc 
dispenser  (Oxoid).  The  plates  were  incubated  at  37  °C 
overnight. The diameters of inhibition zones were meas-
ured using sliding calipers and interpreted using standard

break points according to Clinical and Laboratory Stand-
ards Institute [21].

The  antimicrobial  susceptibility  of  colistin  was  deter-
mined  by  disc  diffusion  susceptibility  testing  using 
colistin  discs  (Oxoid)  containing  10  μg.  The  disc  zone 
diameters was interpreted according to previous report 
[22].

Molecular detection of antimicrobial resistance associated 
genes
Escherichia  coli  and  S.  enterica  isolates  were  tested  for 
β-lactamase-encoding  genes  blaTEM,  blaSHV,  blaCTX-M, 
blaOXA  and  blaCMY  by  PCR  using  universal  primers  for 
the  corresponding  gene  families  (Table  3)  as  described 
previously  [23].  PCR  amplification  was  also  used  for 
screening  of  plasmid-mediated  quinolone  resistance 
genes qnrA, qnrB and qnrS.

For  detection  of  variants  of  blaTEM,  blaSHV,  blaCTX-M, 
blaOXA and blaCMY amplified PCR fragments were puri-
fied  from  agarose  gels  using  Nucleospin  Gel  Extraction 
Kit  (Macherey–Nagel,  Düren,  Germany).  The  products 
were sequenced and the sequencing results were analyzed 
using BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast.cgi).

Colistin  resistance  associated  gene  mcr-1was  identi-
fied using a PCR assay (Table 3) as described by Liu et al. 
[24].  PCR  for  detection  of  carbapenemases  blaOXA-23 
gene  was  performed  using  OXA-23-F  and  OXA-23-R 

(Table 3). PCR reaction and conditions were performed 
according to Braun et al. [25].

Detection and sequencing of class 1 and class 2 integrons
PCR assays for detection of class 1 and class 2 integrons 
were  performed  using  primers  given  in  Table  3  and 
yielded PCR fragments that were purified from agarose 
gels  using  Nucleospin  Gel  Extraction  Kit  (Macherey–
Nagel, Düren, Germany). The products were sequenced 
in Genome Centre, Gifu University, Japan. The sequenc-
ing results were analyzed using BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/blast.cgi).

Results
Out  of  180  examined  samples  15  S.  enterica  (8.3%)  (7 
from poultry and 8 from beef) (Table 1) as well as 21 E. 
coli (11.7%) (15 from poultry and 6 from beef) (Table 2) 
were isolated and identified using bacteriological meth-
ods and biochemical characterization.

Serological characterization of S. enterica and E. coli
Fifteen  isolated  S.  enterica  were  typed  as  9  S.  enterica 
serovar Typhimurium (60.0%; 3 from chicken and 6 from 
beef), 3 S. enterica Paratyphi A (20.0%; 2 from chickens 
and 1 from beef), 2 S. enterica serovar Enteritidis (13.3%; 
1 from chicken and 1 from beef) and 1 S. enterica serovar 
Kentucky (6.7%) from chicken sample (Table 1).

Twenty-one E. coli isolates were characterized as 4 O18 
(19.0%) and 4 O78 (19.0%) serotypes. Other serotypes are 
given in Table 2.

Molecular identification of Salmonella serovars
All  15  recovered  S.  enterica  serovars  harboured  ompC 
gene, which confirms Salmonella genus. Nine S. enterica 
serovar Typhimurium (60.0%) and two S. enterica serovar 
Enteritidis (13.3%) were identified by means of serovar-
specific  bands  using  PCR  (Table  3).  Four  other  isolates 
could not be typed with PCR method (26.7%).

Determination of antimicrobial susceptibility profiles
The results of determination of antimicrobial resistance 
of  S.  enterica  and  E.  coli  isolates  to  thirteen  antibiotics 
are given in Tables 4 and 5. Most of the S. enterica iso-
lates showed resistance to ampicillin (87.0%) and cefotax-
ime (80.0%) and all were susceptible to chloramphenicol, 
colistin and ciprofloxacin. Resistance to other antibiotics 
was shown in Table 4.

Seven  isolates  of  S.  enterica  serovar  Typhimurium 
were resistant to ampicillin, cefotaxime and cefpodoxime 
(77.8%), while 6 isolates (66.7%) were highly sensitive to 
ciprofloxacin. Resistance to other antibiotics was weaker 
developed.

Both S. enterica serovar Enteritidis isolates were resist-
ant  to  ampicillin,  cefotaxime  and  tetracycline.  Addi-
tionally,  one  isolate  showed  resistance  to  streptomycin, 
nalidixic  acid,  trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole  and 
streptomycin.

In  addition  to  the  entire  resistance  to  ampicillin  and 
cefotaxime, majority of the S. enterica serovar Paratyphi 
A  isolates  were  resistant  to  amoxicillin–clavulanic  acid, 
ceftriaxone and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole.

Salmonella  enterica  serovar  Kentucky  isolate  showed 
no  pronounced  susceptibility  to  any  of  the  tested  anti-
biotics and was resistant to six of them (Table 4). Seven 
out of 15 S. enterica serovars (46.7%) revealed phenotypic 
multidrug resistance exhibiting by resistance to three or 
more classes of antibiotics (Table 4).

Escherichia  coli  isolates  showed  resistance  to  tetra-
trimethoprim/sul-
cycline,  ampicillin,  streptomycin, 
phamethoxazole  and  amoxicillin–clavulanic  acid  with 
80.9, 71.4, 61.9, 61.9 and 61.9%, respectively. Ten (47.6%), 
9 (42.8%) and 9 (42.8%) isolates were susceptible to cip-
rofloxacin,  enrofloxacin  and  ceftriaxone,  respectively. 
All  tested  isolates  were  susceptible  to  colistin.  Thirteen 
E.  coli  isolates  (61.9%)  were  characterized  as  multidrug 
resistant (Table 5).

The multidrug resistance of isolated Salmonella and E. 

coli was shown in Tables 6 and 7, respectively. 

Molecular detection of resistance‑associated genes
Six  of  8  screened  resistance-associated  genes  were 
detected in S. enterica serovars by PCR (Table 6). Eleven 
(73.3%)  isolates  harboured  blaCTX-M  gene  (1,  3  and  14) 
associated  with  cefotaxime  resistance  and  11  (73.3%) 
isolates  harboured  blaTEM-1  gene  associated  with  peni-
cillin and narrow spectrum β-lactamase resistance. Five 
(33.3%)  isolates  harboured  quinolone  resistance  gene

A  (qnrA),  while  3  (20.0%),  2  (13.3%)  and  1  (6.7%)  of  S. 
enterica serovars possessed qnrB, blaCMY and qnrS genes, 
respectively. blaOXA associated with resistance to ampi-
cillin  and  cephalothin  and  blaSHV  associated  with  plas-
mid-mediated  ampicillin  resistance  were  not  found  in 
any isolate.

In E. coli isolates, 5 of 8 screened resistance-associated 
genes were detected by PCR (Table 7). Eleven (52.4%) out 
of 21 isolates harboured blaTEM (1 and 104), while blaCTX-
M (1 and 14) was detected in 9 isolates (42.9%). Seven iso-
lates (33.3%) carried qnrA and qnrB and in three isolates 
(14.3%) blaOXA-1 was detected. Genes blaCMY, blaSHV and 
qnrS were not detected in any of the E. coli isolates.

Plasmid-mediated  colistin  resistance  gene  mcr-1  and 
carbapenemase  resistance  gene  blaOXA-23  were  not 
identified  neither  in  S.  enterica  nor  in  E.  coli  isolates 
using PCR assay.

Integron gene cassettes and DNA sequencing
Class 1 integron was detected in two isolates of S. Typh-
imurium using PCR (Table 6). The inserted gene cassettes 

identified  three  types  of  antimicrobial  resistance  genes 
associated  with  class  1  integron:  dihydrofolate  reduc-
tase types (dfrA15 and dfrA17) which confer resistance 
to  trimethoprim,  and  aminoglycoside  adenyltransferase 
type aadA2 that confers resistance to streptomycin and 
spectinomycin.

Three E. coli isolates of serotypes O18, O78 and O78 
were harbouring class 1 integron (Table 7). The inserted 
gene cassettes identified three types of class 1 integron. 
The identified antimicrobial resistance genes were dihy-
drofolate  reductase  types;  dfrA1,  dfrA15  and  dfrA1-orf 
which confer resistance to trimethoprim.

All S. enterica and E. coli isolates were negative for class 

2 integrons.

Discussion
Salmonellosis  and  Salmonella  infections  considered  as 
critical threats to human and animal health. In this study, 
the  prevalence  of  S.  enterica  serovars  in  chicken  and 
beef meat was 8.3%, which was considerably lower than 
incidence  rates  that  reported  in  Ethiopia  (12.0%  in  raw 

Moawad et al. Gut Pathog  (2017) 9:57

meat) [26], Canary islands (16.5% in chicken meat) [27], 
Northwestern  Spain  (17.9%  in  chicken)  [28],  Ethiopia 
(17.9% in chicken and giblets) [29], and Egypt (10.0% in 
poultry meat) [7]. On the other hand, it was higher than 
reported previously in meat products in Egypt (6.6%) and 
in ground beef in the United States (4.2%) [30, 31].

In  total,  S.  enterica  serovar  Typhimurium  was  the 
dominant serovar. These results were in accordance with 
previous study from chicken products in Cambodia and 
Thailand  [32].  Controversially,  S.  enterica  serovar  Ente-
ritidis  was  the  dominant  serotype  in  imported  frozen 
poultry  samples  from  Brazil  to  Canary  Islands  and  in 
chicken carcasses in Spain [27, 28]. Salmonella enterica 
serovar  Kentucky  was  frequently  detected  in  samples 
coming from US to Canary Islands [27].

Prevalence of E. coli in chicken meat and organs was 
16.7%  which  was  lower  than  in  Nigeria  (43.4%)  in  fro-
zen poultry meat [33] but higher than in Korea (4.9% in 
poultry meat) [34]. Prevalence of E. coli in beef meat was 
6.7%, while in Korea and Iran were found 4.1 and 29.0%, 
respectively [34, 35].

In this study, 19.0% of E. coli isolates typed as O78 was 
mainly from poultry products, while in China, O78 was 
identified  in  60.0%  of  E.  coli  isolated  from  chicken  and 
ducks [36]. E. coli type O158 identified in 9.5% only in 
beef meat while O158 detected in 22.7% of food isolates 
in Chile [37].

Bacterial antimicrobial resistance is a global emerging 

problem of public health concern.

In  the  current  study,  a  high  percentage  of  S.  enterica 
serovars  were  resistant  to  ampicillin  and  cefotaxime. 
The resistance to other antimicrobial agents was variable 
while all isolates were sensitive to chloramphenicol and 
ciprofloxacin.  The  results  were  in  a  partial  accordance 
with results of previous reports stating that all S. enterica 
isolated  from  chicken  meat  and  beef  were  sensitive  to 
ciprofloxacin  [38].  72.4%  of  Salmonella  isolates  in  Thai 
meat  products  were  resistant  to  ampicillin  while  71.0% 
of  isolates  in  Cambodian  meat  products  were  resistant 
to sulfamethoxazole [32]. Controversially, S. enterica iso-
lated from animals and food of animal origin in Italy were 
highly resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, strepto-
mycin  and  tetracycline  [39]  and  all  Salmonella  isolated 
from beef in Tunisia were susceptible to amoxicillin and 
clavulanic acid [40].

In total, 46.7% of S. enterica serovars showed multidrug 
resistance,  which  was  higher  than  resistance  of  Salmo-
nella isolated from raw chicken (31.0%) in Pennsylvania 
during [41]. Less multidrug resistant S. enterica isolates 
(6.0%) were identified in cattle hides and carcasses in the 
US [42].

The  results  of  this  study  showed  that  the  antimicro-
bial resistance of E. coli isolated from poultry was higher 

than  from  beef  to  the  most  of  tested  antibiotics.  The 
high  resistance  to  tetracycline,  ampicillin,  amoxycillin–
clavulanic  acid,  trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole  and 
streptomycin in this study was in agreement with previ-
ous reports conducted in Egypt [10, 43] and Algeria [44]. 
While in Spain, most of E. coli isolated from diarrhoeic 
and  healthy  lambs  were  highly  resistant  to  tetracycline 
and streptomycin but show lower resistance to ampicillin 
[45]. Most of E. coli isolates in this study were sensitive 
to enrofloxacin, chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone which 
is in agreement with previous results in Spain [45].

In this study, 61.9% of E. coli isolates were multidrug 
resistant.  Similar  results  reported  previously  in  Ghana 
and US [23, 46].

Most of the phenotypically antibiotic resistant S. enter-
ica  serovars  carried  antibiotic  resistance  marker  genes 
associated with β-lactams and quinolones.

The  β-lactamase  encoding  gene  blaTEM  conferring 
resistance  to  penicillins  and  first-generation  cephalo-
sporins was detected in 73.3% of S. enterica serovars and 
in 76.9% of ampicillin-resistant isolates which is signifi-
cantly high in comparison to 57.3% (blaTEM-1) in S. enter-
ica isolated from retail chickens in China [47]. Another 
β-lactamase  encoding  gene  blaCMY-2,  an  AmpC  beta-
lactamase gene that confers resistance to a wide variety 
of β-lactam antibiotics detected in 13.3% of isolates. In 
contrast,  in  4.7%  of  S.  enterica  serovars  Typhimurium 
and Enteritidis originated from diseased broilers in Egypt 
blaCMY-2 was identified [48] and all resistant S. enterica 
serovar  Typhimurium  isolated  from  retail  meat  in  US 
were harbouring blaCMY [49]. The same gene could not 
be detected previously in any S. enterica serovar Typh-
imurium isolated from chicken meat in Egypt [8].

blaCTX-M  could  be  identified  in  73.3%  of  isolated  S. 
enterica serovars. In 24.0 and 18.8% of different Salmo-
nella  serovars  isolated  from  retail  chicken  carcasses  in 
China, blaCTX-M-15 and blaCTX-M-3 were detected, respec-
tively [47].

The  blaSHV  is  responsible  for  the  plasmid-mediated 
ampicillin  resistance  and  β-lactamase  encoding  genes 
blaOXA  conferring  resistance  to  ampicillin  and  cepha-
lothin not detected in any of S. enterica serovars in this 
study. This result was in accordance with a result for S. 
enterica  serovar  Typhimurium  isolated  from  chicken 
meat in Egypt [8]. In contrast, 30.2% of ESBL-producing 
Salmonella isolated from raw chicken carcasses in China 
were harbouring blaOXA-1 [47].

Although  none  of  S.  enterica  serovars  were  pheno-
typically resistant to ciprofloxacin, qnrA, qnrB and qnrS 
genes were detected in 33.3, 20.0 and 6.7%, respectively in 
all S. enterica serovars and in 100, 60.0 and 20.0%, respec-
tively in S. enterica resistant to nalidixic acid. A different 
result  showed  that  1.16%  of  nalidixic  acid-resistant  S.

enterica serovars isolated from animal products in Tuni-
sia carried qnr gene [50]. In other studies in China qnrA, 
qnrB and qnrS genes detected with low percentage in S. 
enterica serovar Enteritidis isolated from retail raw poul-
try [51, 52].

The blaTEM gene was detected in 52.3% of all isolated 
E. coli and in 73.3% of ampicillin-resistant isolates. Other 
studies detected blaTEM in 97.1 and 75.0% of E. coli iso-
lates from lambs in Spain and meat products in Cambo-
dia, respectively [32, 45]. In China, blaTEM was identified 
in 7.8% of ESBL-producing E. coli recovered from meat 
products [53].

The β-lactamase encoding gene blaCMY was not found 
in  any  of  the  isolated  E.  coli.  In  contrast,  blaCMY-2  was 
detected  in  89.0%  E.  coli  isolated  from  poultry  meat  in 
Denmark  [54]  and  in  12.5%  of  ESBL-producing  E.  coli 
isolated from meat products in Cambodia [32].

The  blaCTX-M  detected  in  42.9%  of  E.  coli  isolated 
in  this  study.  In  Ghana  50.0%  of  ESBL-producing  E. 
coli  isolates  from  meat  harboured  blaCTX-M  [46]  while 
these β-lactamase encoding genes blaCTX-M-15 and blaCTX-
M-9  were  detected  rarely  (1.6%)  in  E.  coli  isolates  from 
meat products in China [53].

The blaSHV gene was not found in any of the E. coli iso-
lates. Controversially, previous studies detected blaSHV in 
9.4, 5.3 and 2.0% in meat products in China, broiler chick-
ens and chicken carcasses in Iran, respectively [53, 55, 56].
blaOXA-1  was  detected  in  14.3%  of  the  E.  coli  isolates 
which  is  in  contrast  with  previous  report  conducted  in 
retail meat in US where the gene could not be identified 
[23].

The  most  common  carbapenemase 

types  were 
blaOXA-23  and  blaOXA-48  accounting  for  47%  of  all 
identified  carbapenemase  genes  [25,  57].  In  this  study, 
blaOXA-23 was not identified in all isolated strains.

In isolated E. coli, qnrA and qnrB detected in 33.3% of 
isolates,  all  nalidixic  acid  and/or  ciprofloxacin  resistant 
isolates harboured both genes. While qnrB and qnrS were 
identified in 10.4% of nalidixic acid resistant E. coli iso-
lated from Algerian retail chicken meat [44] and in 10.0% 
of E. coli isolates obtained from bovine carcasses in Mex-
ico  [58].  In  contrast,  qnrA,  qrnB  and  qrnS  genes  could 
not be identified in enrofloxacin-resistant E. coli strains 
from poultry in Mexico [59].

The presence of genetic elements such as integrons and 
transposons  are  often  associated  with  multi-resistant 
phenotypes among Salmonella isolates [60]. In this study, 
class 1 integron detected in 13.3% of S. enterica serovars. 
The  identified  gene  cassettes  were  dfrA15,  dfrA17  and 
aadA2. In previous studies, class 1 integron identified in 
90.0%  of  multi-drug  resistant  Salmonella  isolates  from 
retail chicken meat in Japan and the identified genes cas-
settes  were  dfrA1,  dfrA7,  aadA1,  aadB,  and  catB3  [61, 

62]. The gene cassettes of class 1 integron which detected 
in Salmonella spp. isolated from poultry meat in Egypt 
were harbouring aac (3)-Id, aadA2, aadA4, aadA7, sat, 
dfrA15,  lnuF  and  estX  resistance  genes  [7].  In  a  study 
conducted in Portugal, 75.0% of S. enterica isolated from 
different sources including food products had one or two 
class 1 integrons [63].

The identified gene cassettes of class 1 integron dfrA1, 
dfrA15 and dfrA1-orf which confer resistance to trimeth-
oprim were identified in 14.3% of E. coli isolated in this 
study. This is in agreement with E. coli isolates from retail 
chickens  in  Japan  [62]  and  in  1.9  and  11.4%  of  isolates 
from Thai and Cambodian meat samples obtained from 
slaughterhouses  and  fresh  markets  and  the  most  com-
mon gene cassette was dfrA12-aadA2 [32].

Class  2  integrons  were  not  detected  in  all  isolates  of 
this study which is in contrast to 5.6% positive samples in 
Egypt [10].

In  this  study,  mcr-1  gene  associated  with  colistin 
resistance was neither detected in S. enterica nor E. coli 
isolates.  This  result  was  in  agreement  with  the  result 
reported by Doumith et al. [64] who investigated 24,000 
isolates  of  Enterobacteriaceae  from  food  and  humans 
including S. enterica and E. coli and found only 15 mcr-1 
positive  isolates.  Recently,  Quesada  et  al.  identified  the 
gene mcr-1 in nine S. enterica and E. coli isolates from 
poultry and swine for the first time in Spain [65]. Jayol 
et  al.  found  the  mcr-1  in  13%  of  E.  coli  and  S.  enterica 
[66]. Considering the frequent use of colistin in animal 
production and the importance of this antimicrobial for 
the control of multi-resistant Gram-negative nosocomial 
infections  in  humans,  monitoring  the  dissemination  of 
resistance to colistin is mandatory.

In  conclusion,  the  results  of  this  study  showed  high 
prevalence of S. enterica and E. coli as foodborne patho-
gens isolated from poultry and beef meat in Egypt. The 
emergence of antimicrobial resistance of S. enterica and 
E. coli isolates is of public concerns in Egypt. Significant 
resistance  was  detected  to  penicillin,  cephalosporins, 
tetracycline and sulphonamides. Dissemination of ESBL 
and  AmpC-β-lactamase  resistance-associated  genes  in 
S. enterica and E. coli was determined. Presence of class 
1  integron  in  S.  enterica  and  E.  coli  and  genes  associ-
ated with antibiotic resistance was also confirmed. Class 
2 integron was not detected in any isolate. Further work 
should  be  performed  to  characterize  S.  enterica  and  E. 
coli isolates of animal and human origin from the same 
region  sharing  the  same  resistance  markers  in  order  to 
highlight  potential  horizontal  gene  transfer  by  these 
zoonotic organisms.
