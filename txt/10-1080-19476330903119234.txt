(Received 24 November 2008; ﬁnal version received 8 June 2009)

The presence of Escherichia coli in foods taken from the grocery stores and the supermarkets in Hidalgo State
(Mexico) was determined for 73 samples of poultry meat, 60 samples of pork, 86 samples of beef, and 66 samples of
vegetables. A total of 352 E. coli strains were isolated, identiﬁed, and analyzed by an agar disk diﬀusion assay for
their resistance to 10 antimicrobials. Poultry meat and vegetables taken from groceries showed signiﬁcantly higher
counts (P ¼ 0.0002 and P ¼ 0.0461, respectively) when compared with the samples taken from supermarkets.
Compared with the isolates recovered from other foods, E. coli isolated from chicken meat had higher levels of
antimicrobial resistance against all antimicrobials tested, with the exceptions of nitrofurantoin resistance of isolates
from pork and streptomycin resistance in isolates from pork and beef. In addition, the E. coli isolates from samples
taken from the groceries showed higher resistance rates than the isolates from samples taken from the supermarkets
for the cases of pork isolates resistance to ampicillin (P ¼ 0.0497), chloramphenicol (P ¼ 0.0075), doxycycline
(P ¼ 0.002), and streptomycin (P ¼ 0.0094) and beef
resistance against ampicillin (P ¼ 0.0048),
streptomycin (P ¼ 0.002), and sulﬁsoxazole (P ¼ 0.003). The present study revealed that the observed resistance
rates correlated well with those reported in the national surveillance programmes of developed countries, with the
exception of isolates from chicken meat, which have higher resistance rates. Also, from a microbiological safety point
of view, samples taken from supermarkets were in a much better conditions than those obtained from the groceries.

isolates

La presencia de Escherichia coli fue investigada en 73 muestras de carne de pollo, 60 muestras de carne de cerdo, 86
muestras de carne de vacuno y 66 muestras de alimentos vegetales muestreados en pequen˜ os ultramarinos y
supermercados en el estado de Hidalgo (Me´ xico). Un total de 352 aislamientos de E. coli fueron seleccionados,
identiﬁcados y analizados mediante el me´ todo de difusio´ n en disco para determinar su resistencia a 10 antimicrobianos.
Las muestras de pollo y vegetales obtenidas en tiendas de alimentacio´ n mostraron recuentos de E. coli signiﬁcativamente
mayores (P ¼ 0,0002 y P ¼ 0,0461 respectivamente) que las obtenidas en supermercados. Comparados con los
procedentes de los restantes alimentos, los E. coli obtenidos a partir de carne de pollo mostraron un mayor grado de
resistencia a todos los antimicrobianos estudiados, excepto en lo referente a la nitrofurantoı´ na en el caso de los aislados a
partir de carne de cerdo y la estreptomicina respecto de los aislamientos de carne de cerdo y vacuno. Adicionalmente, en
algunos casos, los E. coli obtenidos a partir de alimentos muestreados en pequen˜ os ultramarinos mostraron mayores
tasas de resistencia que los procedentes de alimentos muestreados en supermercados. Esto ocurrio´ en los aislamientos
procedentes de carne de cerdo para la ampicilina (P ¼ 0,0497), cloranfenicol (P ¼ 0,0075), doxiciclina (P ¼ 0,002) y
estreptomicina (P ¼ 0,0094), y en el caso de la carne de vacuno para la ampicilina (P ¼ 0,0048), estreptomicina
(P ¼ 0,002) y sulﬁzoxazol (P ¼ 0,003). El presente estudio demuestra que las tasas de resistencia observadas son
compatibles con las publicadas en los programas nacionales de vigilancia de los paı´ ses desarrollados, con la excepcio´ n de
los aislamientos procedentes de carne de pollo, en los cuales las tasas de resistencia tienden a ser mayores. Adema´ s, desde
el punto de vista de la seguridad microbiolo´ gica, las muestras obtenidas en supermercados mostraron condiciones
signiﬁcativamente mejores que las obtenidas en tiendas de alimentacio´ n.

(White, 1998). Generally, these agents are used thera-
peutically in animals and humans for the control of
bacterial infections, although in some countries (such as
Mexico), antimicrobials may also be incorporated into
livestock and poultry feed at sub-therapeutic doses as
growth promoters. This practice is believed to enhance
selection of resistant bacteria far more than the
therapeutic use of antimicrobial agents in response to
the clinical disease (Van den Bogaard, London, Dries-
sen, & Stobberingh, 2001). As a result, this practice has
been banned in the European Community (EC, 2003),
but in most countries, it is still allowed.

In recent decades, there has been an increase in
bacterial antibiotic resistance, especially in the devel-
oping countries
(Nys, Okeke, Kariuki, Dinant,
Driessen, & Stobberingh, 2004). Contrary to the
developed nations, where most antimicrobial prescrip-
tions are in the hands of the medical community
(Phillips et al., 2003),
in developing nations it is a
common practice for the patients and the farmers to
obtain the antibiotics directly from a pharmacist
without a medical prescription. As a result,
inade-
quate therapeutic protocols are often applied to
humans and animals and contribute to the emergence
and spread of antibiotic-resistant
(Calva,
Sifuentes-Osornio, & Ceron, 1996; Phillips et al.,
2003). In addition, in situations typical to developing
countries,
increases in human and animal popula-
tions, in combination with a suboptimal management
of fecal waste, also enable the dissemination of enteric
resistant bacteria (selected during antimicrobial treat-
ments) directly into the environment (Rosas et al.,
2006). The antibiotic resistance of
the bacterial
isolates of animal origin can also present a potential
hazard to the consumers via food-borne infections
caused by the antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and can
also contribute resistance genes to endogenous human
bacteria (van den Bogaard et al., 2001).

strains

Vegetables represent another way for transmission
of antimicrobial resistant bacteria to food consumers.
Antimicrobials are currently used to prevent bacterial
diseases in plants and to protect fruit trees from ﬁre
blight (Vidaver, 2002). Additionally, contamination by
human and veterinary sources of antimicrobials, their
metabolites, and resistant bacteria can also occur via
contact with sewage and waste water (Kemper, 2008;
Phillips et al., 2003).

Monitoring the veterinary use of antimicrobial
agents in animals destined for human consumption is
considered as a risk-management option to prevent the
development and spread of antimicrobial resistance in
microorganisms present
in food-producing animals
(Vose et al., 2001). Programmes to monitor resistance
are therefore essential. Many countries, such as Canada
(CIPARS, 2005), Denmark (DANMAP, 2006), Spain
(VAV Network, 2005), Sweden (SVARM, 2005), the
Netherlands (MARAN, 2005), or the USA (NARMS,
2007)

national

programmes to monitor the antibiotic susceptibility of
enteric bacteria isolated from animals and animal-origin
foods. However, not much information is available
about the monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in
bacteria isolated from food in developing nations (such
as Mexico).

Although a variety of diﬀerent bacterial species
have been used for these monitoring programmes,
commensal bacteria are particularly important because
their isolation and identiﬁcation is relatively easy and
allows the comparison of the resistance levels between
diﬀerent populations (Knezevic & Petrovic, 2008).
When compared with the other microorganisms found
mostly in foods, Escherichia coli has been a very useful
biomarker for evaluating the development of antimi-
crobial resistance (Von Baum & Marre, 2005). In
addition to its high frequency of mutation, which can
favour the spontaneous development of antimicrobial
resistance, E. coli also has the ability to transfer microbial
resistance between individual bacteria (Kijima-Tanaka
et al., 2003; Sa´ enz et al., 2001; Sayah, Kaneene, Johnson,
& Miller, 2005; Von Baum & Marre, 2005). Thus,
changes in the resistance of this species may serve as a
good indicator of resistance in potentially pathogenic
bacteria (Kijima-Tanaka et al., 2003; Von Baum &
Marre, 2005).

The main goal of this study was to investigate the
presence of antimicrobial resistance of E. coli strains
derived from foods in Hidalgo State (Mexico). The
implications of these results in terms of microbiological
safety, especially those concerning the development
and spread of the antimicrobial resistance up the food
chain, are also discussed.

Materials and methods

Collection of food samples

A total of 285 raw, unprocessed, and unpackaged
food samples were taken during 2008 from both the
supermarkets and the grocery shops
(including
butcher and poultry shops). Among these, 73 were
poultry meat samples (38 drumsticks taken from the
supermarkets and 35 drumsticks
taken from the
groceries), 60 were pork samples (32 pork loin and
chops taken from the supermarkets and 28 pork loin
and chops taken from the groceries), 86 were the beef
samples (42 beef ﬁllets and chops taken from the
supermarkets and 44 beef ﬁllets and chops taken from
the groceries), and 66 were the vegetable foods
samples (11 samples of lettuce, 11 of spinach, and
11 of chards taken from both supermarkets and
groceries). Not more than three samples from each
group were taken from the same sale outlet, these
samples were taken on diﬀerent days. Samples were
placed in sterile bags and transported to the
laboratory in an ice chest
in lesser than 1 h for
immediate processing. All supermarkets and groceries
were located in Hidalgo State (east-central Me´ xico).

Twenty-ﬁve gram portions were obtained for each
sample, placed in a sterile masticator bag together with
an appropriate volume (1/9) (w/v) of sterile 0.85%
NaCl solution (Sigma, St Louis, MO), and homo-
genized in a stomacher (Seward, London, UK) for
1 min. After homogenization, samples were cultured
for the presence of E. coli. One-hundred microliters
ranging from 1071 to 1076 dilutions of food extracts
were processed on plates of Eosin Methylene Blue
(EMB) agar, prepared by following the manufacturer’s
instructions (Oxoid, Bakingstoke, UK). After 18–24 h
of incubation at 37 8C, purple colonies with a dark
centre and a metallic green sheen were considered as
presumptive E. coli and counted.

Only plates containing less than 250 presumptive
colonies were counted. The counts of E. coli obtained
for each sample were converted to log10 values and
expressed as log10 CFU71 samples. When counts were
below the detection limit (2 log CFU g71 sample), a
theoretical value of 1.9 log CFU g71 was assigned
prior to the determination of the average counts, which
were determined for each food type taken from the
groceries and the supermarkets.

Three colonies of presumptive E. coli were ran-
domly picked from each sample, except for the case of
samples in which only one of the two presumptive E.
coli colonies were available; in these cases only one or
two colonies were picked. Isolated presumptive E. coli
were subsequently transferred onto Columbia agar
supplemented with 5% sheep blood (BioMe´ rieux,
Plainview, NY), and incubated at 44 8C for 24 h to
obtain pure cultures. These pure cultures were then
analyzed for strain identiﬁcation by colony and cell
morphology, Gram stain, methyl red stain, oxidase and
catalase activity, and indole production. Positive
strains preliminarily identiﬁed as E. coli were con-
ﬁrmed by the API 20E miniaturized identiﬁcation tests
(BioMe´ rieux). All identiﬁed E. coli were used for the
determination of the antimicrobial susceptibility.

Aintimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacteria

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done for a
total of 352 isolates of E. coli. Testing was carried out
using agar disk diﬀusion on Mu¨ eller-Hinton agar
plates (Oxoid), according to the Clinical and Labora-
tory Standards Institute (CLSI,
formerly NCCLS,
2002) guidelines. Antimicrobial disks used were:
ampicillin (10 mg), cephalothin (30 mg), chlorampheni-
col (30 mg), doxycycline (30 mg), ciproﬂoxacin (5 mg),
fosfomycin (200 mg), gentamicin (10 mg), nitrofuran-
toin (300 mg), streptomycin (10 mg), and sulﬁsoxazole
(300 mg)
(Oxoid). Antibiotic resistance breakpoints
considered were those recommended by CLSI for
Enterobacteriaceae (NCCLS, 2002). E. coli ATCC
25922 was used as a reference strain for this study.

Antimicrobial agents were selected on the basis of
their diverse chemical structures and mechanisms of
action. E. coli
isolates were classiﬁed as sensitive,
intermediate, or resistant according to the criteria
(inhibition diameter zones) established by the CLSI.
Isolates showing resistance to at least three of the
antimicrobial agents tested were considered to be
multi-resistant strains.

Statistical analysis
The average log CFU g71 values of E. coli in foods
obtained from supermarkets and groceries were
compared using a Student’s t-test. The distributions
of resistant strains between food type and origin, as
well as multi-resistance patterns, were compared with
the w2 test, and by the w2 test with the Yates’ correction
when only two categories were available. The diﬀer-
ences were considered to be signiﬁcant when P was
lesser than 0.05. All statistical analyses were done with
the Statgraphics version 5.0.1. software (SAS Institute,
North Carolina).

Results and discussion

The average counts of presumptive E. coli (Figure 1)
showed that poultry meat and vegetable foods had the
greater levels of presumptive E. coli contamination out
of all the tested foods. Furthermore, both poultry meat
(P ¼ 0.0002) and vegetables (P ¼ 0.0461) taken from
the groceries showed higher average counts of pre-
sumptive E. coli when compared with those obtained
from their supermarket counterparts. No signiﬁcant
diﬀerences were found in the case of pork or beef. The
higher levels of presumptive E. coli contamination in
chicken meat and vegetables obtained from the
groceries could be attributed to lower quality facilities
and poor food hygiene practices in groceries compared
to supermarkets. Contrary to similar products for sale
in supermarkets,
it is common practice for poultry
meat and vegetables to be left without refrigeration in
the Mexican groceries.

During recent years, in addition to oﬃcial surveil-
lance and antimicrobial monitoring programmes (CI-
PARS, 2006; DANMAP, 2006; MARAN, 2005;
NARMS, 2007; SVARM, 2005; VAV Network,
2005), some studies have reported the antimicrobial
resistance of E. coli isolated from meat samples and
food-producing animals (Bywater et al., 2004; Guerra
et al., 2003; Kijima-Tanaka et al., 2003; Knezevic &
Petrovic, 2008; Miranda et al., 2008a; Sa´ enz et al.,
2001; Van den Bogaard et al., 2001). However, these
works involved samples taken directly from live or
recently slaughtered animals, and do not take into
consideration the contamination of
foods during
subsequent steps in the food chain. Also, despite the
strong possibility of contamination of vegetable foods
by resistant bacteria from veterinary antimicrobial

resistance of E. coli isolated from vegetable foods.

studies

Data provided in previous

show that
antimicrobial resistance varies widely among com-
pounds, depending on the countries, host, or food from
which the microorganisms have been isolated. The
antimicrobial resistance rates obtained in our study
(Table 1) for beef and pork are largely compatible with
previously reported data for most of the antimicrobials
tested. Interestingly,
isolates was
remarkably higher for older compounds, with the
exception of gentamicin, which is a relatively old
compound that has had little use in animals. In
agreement with the ﬁndings reported in other countries
(Bywater et al., 2004; Knezevic & Petrovic, 2008;
Miranda et al., 2008a), resistance to this antimicrobial
of animal-origin strains is rare.

some antimicrobials in isolates obtained from the
chicken meat tend to be higher than the levels reported
in other countries (Bywater et al., 2004; Kijima-Tanaka
et al., 2003; Miranda et al., 2008a; Sa´ enz et al., 2001;
Van den Bogaard et al., 2001). It is remarkable that the
high level of resistance observed in poultry-origin
isolates for both antimicrobials are commonly used in
poultry medicine, such as ampicillin (76.5%), doxycy-
cline (56.3%), sulﬁsoxazole (77.3%), or ciproﬂoxacin
(77.3%) (Miranda et al., 2008b; Van den Boogard
et al., 2001) and also for antimicrobials that are rarely
used in poultry medicine, such as chloramphenicol
(58%). This high level of chloramphenicol-resistance of
poultry-origin E. coli are in agreement with the
chloramphenicol-resistance found in E. coli
isolates
from Mexico in the urban environments (33–53%)
(Rosas et al., 2006) or in faecal samples of Mexican
healthy volunteers (45–75%) (Nys et al., 2004).

It is also interesting that the isolates from the
chicken meat showed higher resistance levels than
those obtained from other type of foods, with the
exception of nitrofurantoin resistance in isolates from
pork and streptomycin resistance in isolates from pork
and beef. On the other hand, resistance incidence in
isolates obtained from pork and beef tend to be similar,
except for ampicillin (P ¼ 0.0068) and sulﬁsoxazole
(P ¼ 0.0189), which are signiﬁcantly higher in beef-
origin isolates.

However, isolates obtained from vegetable foods
showed similar or lower resistance levels than isolates
from all other foods tested, with the exception of
ciproﬂoxacin resistance, which had higher resistance
levels compared to isolates from beef (P ¼ 0.0033). In
this case, it is reasonable to think that ciproﬂoxacin-
resistant E. coli could reach vegetable foods though
human or poultry farm-inﬂuenced wastewater or
sewage (Sabate´ et al., 2008; Sayah et al., 2005).

The results obtained in the present work provide
supporting evidence for the idea that the antimicrobial
resistance of E. coli isolates can change depending on

the same trend was

the sample source. Isolates from pork obtained from the
groceries showed signiﬁcantly higher resistance for
the antimicrobials ampicillin (P ¼ 0.0497), chloram-
phenicol (P ¼ 0.0075), doxycycline (P ¼ 0.002), and
streptomycin (P ¼ 0.0094) when compared with the
resistance of isolates obtained from the samples bought
from the supermarkets. In the case of isolates from
beef,
found for ampicillin
(P ¼ 0.0048), streptomycin (P ¼ 0.002), and sulﬁsox-
azole (P ¼ 0.003), whereas higher resistance rates for
fosfomycin were found for isolates obtained from
supermarkets (P ¼ 0.0013) compared to isolates from
groceries samples. This seems to suggest either a more
frequent use of antimicrobials or less time taken for a
withdrawal period in animals destined for the produc-
tion of meat to be sold at the groceries than in animals
destined to be sold in the supermarkets. No diﬀerences
were found in the case of isolates from poultry meat
and vegetables. However, it should be pointed out that
the higher average counts found in samples taken from
groceries could skew the results observed with regards
to antimicrobial resistance.
The multi-drug resistance (to 3 antimicrobial
agents, Table 2) exhibited by E. coli
isolated from
poultry (82.3%) was signiﬁcantly higher (P 5 0.0001)
than those obtained for the case of strains isolated
from pork (33.3%), beef
(36.6%), or vegetables
(26.2%). Additionally, multi-drug resistance was also
higher for isolates from beef compared to isolates from
vegetables (P ¼ 0.0259). These results diﬀer from those
obtained by other authors such as Sayah et al. (2005)
or Knezevic and Petrovic (2008) who obtained higher
multidrug-resistance for E. coli isolated from pigs than
for E. coli
isolated from poultry and cattle. Multi-
resistant strains could have been originated as the
result of co-selection of
resistance determinants,
because exposing a bacterial population to one
antimicrobial agent may result in resistance to other
agents without any additional exposure (Sayah et al.,
2005). Thus, it was reported that higher levels of multi-
resistant strains in any group may also reﬂect more

recent antibiotic usage (Van den Bogaard et al., 2001).
Because no information was available about data on
the use of antimicrobial agents
involved in the
production of
the foods tested in this study, no
assessment was conducted foe the relation between
administration of the antimicrobial agents to animals
and the multi-resistance rates of E. coli isolated from
the foods derived from these animals.

In conclusion, as previously reported in developed
countries, the presence of antimicrobial resistance was
much higher in isolates from poultry meat than from
other foods tested and, the resistance rates against older
drugs were higher than against the newer antimicrobials.
Unfortunately, we could not correlate these antimicro-
bial resistance rates to antibiotic use because of the lack
of oﬃcial data on the use of antibiotics in Me´ xico. In
some cases, products taken from grocery shops had
higher levels of E. coli contamination and antimicrobial
resistance than products taken from supermarkets,
indicating that sample source had an important eﬀect
on the microbiological safety of foods. Therefore, it is
important
to conduct surveillance studies annually
repeated, and conduct them in other Mexican states to
study temporal and allocation trends to be able to
determine whether the generally lower levels of resis-
tance to newer antibiotics can be maintained.
