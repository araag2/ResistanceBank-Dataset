  ABSTRACT   This  study  was  performed  to  determine 
the prevalence and to semiquantify Campylobacter spp. 
on chicken meat samples at 4 selected local wet mar-
kets in Nueva Ecija, Philippines, and to determine the 
antimicrobial resistance patterns of the Campylobacter
isolates. Out of 120 chicken meat samples, 57 (47.5%) 
were Campylobacter spp. positive. The majority of iso-
lated Campylobacter strains were identified as Campy-
lobacter coli  (54.4%)  and  45.6%  as  Campylobacter  je-
juni.  Most  of  these  positive  samples  (52.6%)  showed 
a very high quantitative Campylobacter contamination 
(most  probable  number  >  2,400/g,  lower  confidence 
limit  580/g).  For  antimicrobial  resistance  testing,  44 
C. coli/jejuni isolates were tested using the agar disk 

diffusion method. Out of these, 77.3% were resistant to 
ampicillin, followed by ciprofloxacin (70.4%), tetracy-
cline  (54.6%),  erythromycin  (20.2%),  and  gentamicin 
(11.4%). Of the isolates, 36.4% (n = 16) were resistant 
to  1  antimicrobial  agent,  34.1%  (n  =  15)  were  resis-
tance  to  3  antimicrobial  agents,  13.6%  (n  =  6)  to  2 
antimicrobial agents, 9.1% (n = 4) to 4 antimicrobial 
agents, and 6.8% (n = 3) to all 5 antimicrobial agents 
tested. Our data demonstrate a high contamination of 
fresh chicken meat with Campylobacter spp. at retail in 
the Philippines. The detected high Campylobacter prev-
alences and quantitative loads on chicken meat at retail 
in the Philippines highlight the need to implement ef-
ficient intervention measures along the food chain and 
to encourage sanitary handling of poultry meat. 

  INTRODUCTION 

Campylobacter  is  one  of  the  most  important  food-
borne zoonotic diseases worldwide. Contaminated poul-
try and poultry meat is thought to be the major source 
of human campylobacteriosis. Source attribution mod-
els attributed between 58 and 78% of clinical Campy-
lobacter jejuni strains to human cases and between 40 
and 56% of clinical Campylobacter coli strains to chick-
en sources (Wilson et al., 2008; Sheppard et al., 2009). 
  Despite  the  zoonotic  importance  of  this  pathogen, 
only  very  limited  information  on  Campylobacter  in 
animals,  food,  or  humans  in  the  Philippines  is  avail-

able (Magistrado et al., 2001; Baldrias and Raymundo, 
2009). Nonetheless, Campylobacter prevalence data in 
poultry meat are available from neighboring countries, 
such as Thailand and Vietnam, with prevalences of 52 
and 31%, respectively (Luu et al., 2006; Vindigni et al., 
2007).  In  a  literature  survey,  Suzuki  and  Yamamoto 
(2009)  summarized  the  Campylobacter  prevalences  in 
poultry meat in Asian countries, ranging from 30% in 
Vietnam to 82.5% in Turkey. 

  In many countries, antimicrobial resistances in ani-
mal and human Campylobacter strains have increased 
over the years (Hong et al., 2007). In developing coun-
tries, where the use of antimicrobial agents in humans 
and animals is comparably unrestricted, higher rates of 
enteric infections with antimicrobial-resistant Campylo-
bacter spp. were detected (Bungay et al., 2005). 

  The  broiler  industry  in  the  Philippines,  as  in  most 
Asian countries, is more varied and less developed com-

pared with its Western counterparts. In 2012, around 
45% of the total chicken inventories were native or vil-
lage chickens raised in backyard farms. Chickens grown 
in  commercial  farms  were  broilers  and  layers,  which 
accounted for 36 and 19%, respectively (BAS, 2012).

Because baseline data for Campylobacter contamina-
tion on chicken meat are lacking in the Philippines, this 
study  was  conducted  (i)  to  determine  the  prevalence 
of Campylobacter spp. on chicken carcasses, (ii) to de-
scribe the semiquantitative load of Campylobacter spp., 
and (iii) to investigate the antimicrobial resistance pat-
terns  of  the  isolated  Campylobacter  spp.  strains  from 
chicken meat at retail markets in Nueva Ecija, Philip-
pines.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sampling

From  January  to  April  2013,  120  samples  of  fresh 
chicken breast meat (with skin) were taken from 4 wet 
markets, representing 4 districts of the province of Nue-
va Ecija: Cabanatuan City, San Jose City, Gapan City, 
and Guimba. Fifteen samples were collected twice from 
the same chicken meat retail stalls from each wet mar-
ket using random sampling.

Semiquantification of Campylobacter

For Campylobacter detection and semiquantification, 
ISO  10272–3:2010  (ISO,  2010)  was  used  with  some 
modifications.  Briefly,  from  each  sample  15  g  of  skin 
were aseptically removed and blended in a stomacher 
bag with 120 mL of Bolton broth (Oxoid, Basingstoke, 
UK) and homogenized. Ninety milliliters of the initial 
suspension  was  transferred  to  a  100-mL  bottle  (cor-
responding to 10 g of the sample portion). In addition, 
10  mL  of  the  initial  suspension  was  transferred  to  a 
culture tube and used to create a 10-fold dilution series 
of up to 10−4 by transferring 1 mL to tubes containing 
9  mL  of  Bolton  broth.  Bolton  broths  were  incubated 
for  48  h  at  42°C  in  microaerobic  conditions  (5%  O2, 
10% CO2, 85% N2; generated by CampyGen, Oxoid). 
After incubation, 1 loop (approximately 10 µL) of the 
enrichment was streaked onto modified charcoal cefo-
perazone deoxycholate agar (Oxoid). Plates were incu-
bated at 42°C for 44 to 48 h in microaerobic conditions. 
Semiquantitative data are expressed as most probable 
numbers  (MPN)  per  gram  in  accordance  with  ISO 
10272–3:2010/AC:2011 (ISO, 2011).

Genus and Species Confirmation

For Campylobacter confirmation, at least one colony 
considered to be typical or suspected as being Campylo-
bacter spp. was taken, streaked on Columbia blood agar 
(Oxoid), and incubated at 42°C for 44 to 48 h in mi-
croaerobic conditions. Pure cultures were examined for 
morphology  and  motility.  Isolates  were  confirmed  by 

biochemical tests (oxidase and catalase test) and gram 
stained. After DNA extraction, a multiplex PCR was 
carried  out  to  verify  and  differentiate  Campylobacter 
spp.  Primers  and  protocols  were  used  according  to 
Wang et al. (2002), targeting 23S rRNA from Campylo-
bacter spp., hipO from C. jejuni, glyA from each C. coli, 
Campylobacter lari, and Campylobacter upsaliensis.

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test

To investigate the antimicrobial resistance patterns, 
23 C. coli and 21 C. jejuni isolates were tested using the 
disk  diffusion  method  as  recommended  by  the  Clini-
cal and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, 2011). 
Campylobacter  spp.  isolates  were  microaerobically 
grown on Columbia blood agar plates (Oxoid)  for 24 
to 48 h. After incubation colonies were suspended into 
1  mL  of  sterile  distilled  water  until  a  0.5  McFarland 
turbidity  was  reached.  Each  suspension  was  streaked 
onto  a  Mueller-Hinton  blood  agar  plate  (Difco/BD, 
Heidelberg, Germany) using a sterile cotton swab (Kir-
by-Bauer method; Hudzicki, 2013). Five antimicrobial 
discs  were  used  for  sensitivity  testing:  ampicillin  (10 
µg), ciprofloxacin (5 µg), erythromycin (15 µg), genta-
micin (10 µg), and tetracycline (30 µg; all from Oxoid). 
After placing these disks onto the agar surface, plates 
were  incubated  at  42°C  for  24  h  under  microaerobic 
conditions.  After  incubation,  each  disc  was  examined 
for absence or presence of a growth inhibition zone by 
measuring  the  diameter.  The  isolates  were  character-
ized as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant according 
to breakpoints for the disk diffusion method for Cam-
pylobacter spp. provided by Hudzicki (2013).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Prevalence and Semiquantitative Load

The estimated prevalence of Campylobacter on chick-
en  meat  was  47.5%  (57/120;  95%  CI:  38.66–56.72). 
This  result  is  comparable  with  studies  performed  in 
other Asian countries: Vindigni et al. (2007) detected a 
Campylobacter prevalence of 52% on fresh chicken meat 
at retail in Thailand and Luu et al. (2006) observed a 
prevalence of 31% on chicken meat in Vietnam. When 
summarizing  prevalence  data  of  different  studies  per-
formed  in  Asia,  Suzuki  and  Yamamoto  (2009)  calcu-
lated a Campylobacter prevalence of 60.3% on chicken 
meat in Asian countries.

Of  the  positive  samples,  25%  showed  a  very  high 
quantitative  Campylobacter  load  (MPN  >  2,400/g, 
lower confidence limit 580/g; Figure 1). Our data ex-
ceeded the quantitative data detected on chicken skin 
by EFSA (2010) and Chokboonmongkol et al. (2013). 
These authors detected a lower quantitative contami-
nation of between 1 to 4 log cfu/g with only very small 
portions  of  samples  containing  more  than  4  to  5  log 
cfu/g.

cific antimicrobial agents correspond to previous Asian 
studies (Padungtod et al., 2006; Baldrias and Raymun-
do, 2009; Chokboonmongkol et al., 2013). Of the iso-
lates, 36.4% (n = 16) were resistant to 1 antimicrobial 
agent, 34.1% (n = 15) were resistant to 3 antimicrobial 
agents, 13.6% (n = 6) to 2 antimicrobial agents, 9.1% 
(n = 4) to 4 antimicrobial agents, and 6.8% (n = 3) 
to  all  5  antimicrobial  agents  tested.  The  most  com-
mon combination of multidrug resistance was to ampi-
cillin, ciprofloxacin, and tetracycline (34.1%). Compa-
rably, multidrug-resistant Campylobacter isolates have 
been  observed  already  in  the  Philippines  by  Baldrias 
and  Raymundo  (2009).  Resistance  of  Campylobacter 
isolates  is  probably  related  to  antimicrobial  usage  in 
poultry production, which was observed by Baldrias et 
al. (2008) based on antimicrobial residue detection in 
chicken meat in the Philippines.

Conclusions

Our data demonstrate a high prevalence of Campy-
lobacter spp. in fresh chicken meat at retail. Especially 
the high quantitative load of a substantial share of the 
investigated  samples  must  be  of  concern.  To  reduce 
the prevalence and quantitative load of Campylobacter 
on chicken meat, different intervention measures along 
the food chain must be implemented: establishment of 
strict biosecurity measures at the farm level and imple-
mentation of good and efficient intervention measures 
at slaughterhouses to minimize fecal contamination of 
broiler skin and reduce cross-contamination. Awareness 
should be raised for the safe handling of poultry meat 
due to the presence of high Campylobacter numbers on 
fresh chicken meat.

samples (%). MPN = most probable number.

Out of the 57 positive samples, 54.4% (n = 31) were 
identified to be C. coli and 45.6% (n = 26) to be C. 
jejuni. Even though C. jejuni is generally regarded as 
the dominant Campylobacter sp. in chicken or poultry 
(Newell and Fearnley, 2003), several studies described 
a predominance of C. coli in chicken or chicken meat 
originating  from  small-scale  farming  (Meeyam  et  al., 
2004; Padungtod et al., 2006) and organic or free-range 
production (El-Shibiny et al., 2005; Colles et al., 2008). 
These authors speculate that the extended rearing pe-
riods  of  free-range  and  organic  birds  as  well  as  their 
specific environmental exposure might explain the pre-
dominance of C. coli in these cases.

Antimicrobial Resistance Patterns

Altogether, 44 Campylobacter isolates (23 C. coli and 
21  C.  jejuni  isolates)  were  tested  for  their  antimicro-
bial resistance patterns. Of these, 77.3% were resistant 
to  ampicillin,  followed  by  ciprofloxacin,  70.4%;  tetra-
cycline,  54.6%;  erythromycin,  20.2%;  and  gentamicin, 
11.4%  (Figure  2).  Such  high  resistance  rates  to  spe-
