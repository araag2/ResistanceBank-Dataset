ABSTRACT

A cross-sectional

investigation was conducted concerning prevalence, antimicrobial resistance, multidrug resistance
patterns, and serovar diversity of Salmonella in chicken meat sold at retail in Yangon, Myanmar. The 141 chicken meat samples
were collected at 141 retail markets in the Yangon Region, Myanmar, 1 November 2014 to 31 March 2015. Information on
hygienic practices (potential risk factors) was retrieved via checklists. Salmonella was isolated and identiﬁed according to
International Organization for Standardization methods (ISO 6579:2002) with minor modiﬁcations. Twelve antimicrobial agents
belonging to eight pharmacological groups were used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (disk diffusion method). Salmonella
was recovered from 138 (97.9%) of
to trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole (70.3% of isolates), tetracycline (54.3%), streptomycin (49.3%), and ampicillin (47.1%). Resistance was also
found to chloramphenicol (29.7%), amoxicillin–clavulanic acid (17.4%), ciproﬂoxacin (9.4%), tobramycin (8.7%), gentamicin
(8%), cefazolin (7.2%), lincomycin-spectinomycin (5.8%), and norﬂoxacin (0.7%). Among the 138 Salmonella isolates, 72
(52.2%) were resistant to three or more antimicrobial agents. Twenty-four serovars were identiﬁed among the 138 Salmonella-
positive samples; serovars Albany, Kentucky, Braenderup, and Indiana were found in 38, 11, 10, and 8% of samples,
respectively. None of the potential risk factors were signiﬁcantly related to Salmonella contamination of chicken carcasses. This
study provides new information regarding prevalence and antimicrobial resistance and Salmonella serovar diversity in retail
markets in Yangon, Myanmar.

Salmonella is a member of the family Enterobacteria-
ceae. In humans, these pathogenic bacteria can cause enteric
fever (Salmonella Typhi or Salmonella Paratyphi) and acute
gastroenteritis (12). Although more than 2,500 serovars of
Salmonella have been identiﬁed,
the majority of human
Salmonella infections are caused by Salmonella enterica
subsp. group I (18).

Salmonella is most frequently detected in poultry meat
and less often in pig or bovine meat (7). Thus, contaminated
raw poultry products are a signiﬁcant source of human
salmonellosis (33). This issue is important for food safety in
Myanmar because the demand for poultry meat is expected
to double in the next 3 to 5 years (16). The total poultry
population of Myanmar was 264.6 million birds in ﬁscal
year 2014 to 2015, mainly chicken (91%). The Yangon
region has the largest poultry inventory, with 42 million

birds. In the same ﬁscal year (2014 to 2015), chicken meat
production was estimated at 164,000 tons in Yangon and
1,264,000 tons in all of Myanmar (20).

The burden of disease caused by Salmonella is
substantial. An estimated 93.8 million cases of gastroenteritis
caused by Salmonella occur globally each year, with 155,000
deaths. Nearly 80.3 million cases of Salmonella gastroenter-
itis are foodborne (19). In the United States, Salmonella is
estimated to cause more than 1.2 million illnesses each year,
with more than 23,000 hospitalizations and 450 deaths and
$3.3 billion in total medical expenditures and lost productivity
each year (3, 24). Foodborne campylobacteriosis occurs more
frequently in numerous regions (23), and Campylobacter can
also be found in poultry (14, 22); there are fewer fatalities
compared with salmonellosis.

Salmonella infections that result in temporary gastro-
enteritis usually do not require antimicrobial treatment, in
contrast to invasive infections (4). Traditionally, ampicillin,
chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole have

been used to treat such severe cases of salmonellosis.
the increasing number of Salmonella strains
However,
resistant to antimicrobial agents has led to a decrease in
the efﬁcacy of these treatments (2). Fluoroquinolones and
broad-spectrum cephalosporins are currently the preferred
drugs for treatment of human salmonellosis cases because of
the low number of Salmonella isolates that are resistant to
these drugs (8).

The objective of

this study was to determine the
prevalence of antimicrobial resistance and the Salmonella
serovar diversity in chicken at retail markets in Yangon,
Myanmar. Another aim was to identify conditions and
practices in markets that may constitute risk factors for
Salmonella contamination of chicken carcasses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

list of

Sample collection. A cross-sectional study was conducted to
assess the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella in
chicken meat from all retail markets in Yangon, Myanmar. The
141 retail markets were listed as being in the Yangon city area (32).
Each market was visited between 1 November 2014 and 31 March
2015. At each market, one shop was randomly selected from a
paper
random numbers (simple random sampling).
According to the usual practice in such retail shops, the staff cut
the chicken breast from the carcass upon request, and the sample
was taken directly from the cutting board and put in a sterile
polyethylene bag. For every sample, fresh sterile gloves were used
to place the sample into the bag to avoid cross-contamination. The
bag was then sealed and shipped in a cooler with ice to the
laboratory within 8 h. Additional
information on the hygiene
practices in that retail shop was retrieved by using a checklist.

Isolation and identiﬁcation of Salmonella. Samples were
analyzed at the Diagnostic Laboratory of the Livestock Breeding
and Veterinary Department in Yangon; Salmonella was isolated
and identiﬁed according to International Organization for Stan-
dardization method ISO 6579:2002 (‘‘Microbiology of Food and
Animal Feeding Stuffs—Horizontal Method for the Detection of
Salmonella spp.,’’ ISO, Geneva, Switzerland) with minor modiﬁ-
cations.

A 25-g sample of skin from the chicken breast was transferred
to a sterile stomacher bag (400 mL; Sterilin, Newport, UK) with
225 mL of buffered peptone water (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).
Sample surfaces were rinsed by vigorously shaking the bag by
hand about 200 times. The rinse liquid was then incubated at 37 6
18C for 18 6 2 h, 0.1 mL of this preenrichment broth culture was
transferred into a tube containing 10 mL of Rappaport-Vassiliadis-
soya broth (RVS; Merck), and this culture was incubated at 1.5 6
18C for 24 6 3 h. In parallel, 1 mL of the same preenrichment
broth was transferred into a tube containing 10 mL of Muller
Kauffmann tetrathionate novobiocin broth (MKTTn; Merck) and
incubated at 37 6 18C for 24 6 3 h.

The RVS and MKTTn cultures were then streaked onto
xylose lysine Tergitol 4 agar (XLT4; Merck) and brilliant green
phenol red lactose sucrose agar (BPLS; Merck) plates, incubated in
an inverted position at 37 6 18C for 24 6 3 h, and then checked
for typical Salmonella colonies.

Biochemical and serological conﬁrmation. For conﬁrma-
tion of Salmonella identiﬁcation, ﬁve typical colonies were chosen
from each XLT4 and BPLS plate for biochemical conﬁrmation on
triple sugar iron agar (Merck), urea agar (Conda, Madrid, Spain),

and motility indole lysine medium (Difco, Bordeaux, France) after
incubation at 37 6 18C for 24 6 3 h. These conﬁrmed isolates
were streaked on nutrient agar (NA; Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) and
incubated at 37 6 18C for 24 6 3 h, and colonies were conﬁrmed
by slide agglutination with Salmonella O polyvalent antisera
(Serotest, S&A Reagents, Bangkok, Thailand). All isolates positive
for Salmonella after biochemical and serological conﬁrmation were
transferred into half-strength NA in 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes and
stored at 48C.

Antimicrobial susceptibility test. Antimicrobial susceptibil-
ity testing (ampicillin, amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, cefazolin,
chloramphenicol, ciproﬂoxacin, gentamicin, lincomycin-spectino-
mycin, norﬂoxacin, streptomycin,
tobramycin, and
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) was done according to Clinical
and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) methods (5) at
the
Veterinary Public Health Centre for Asia Paciﬁc (Faculty of
Veterinary Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thai-
land) in April 2015. Interpretation of results followed CLSI
methods (6). Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was used as a
reference strain.

tetracycline,

Serotyping. Serotyping of Salmonella isolates was performed
at the Meat Hygiene Section of the Institute of Food Safety and
Food Hygiene (Department of Veterinary Medicine, Freie
Universit¨at, Berlin, Germany) by slide agglutination according to
the Kauffmann-White scheme (10) with commercial antisera (Siﬁn,
Berlin, Germany).

Data collection for market checklist.

Information on
hygienic measures and technical practices at markets was retrieved
through interviews and observations based on a checklist (Table 1)
on the day of the visit.

Data analysis. The resistance pattern of Salmonella isolates
was analyzed by R-commander software, version 3.2.0 (http://
socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/). Answers to questions on
the checklist were used to test for risk factors for Salmonella
contamination. Salmonella status of samples was cross-tabulated
with the answers to each question or item in the checklist, and odds
ratios with 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) were calculated. The
signiﬁcance of the associations was tested with a chi-square or
Fisher’s exact test in R-commander 3.2.0. Results were considered
signiﬁcant at P , 0.05.

RESULTS

Prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Salmo-
nella. The prevalence of Salmonella in chicken meat
samples from the 141 retail markets in Yangon was 97.9%
(95% CI, 93.9 to 99.3%). For these Salmonella isolates,
resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was most
common (70.3% of isolates), followed by resistance to
tetracycline (54.3%), streptomycin (49.3%), ampicillin
(47.1%), chloramphenicol (29.7%), amoxicillin–clavulanic
acid (17.4%), ciproﬂoxacin (9.4%),
tobramycin (8.7%),
gentamicin (8%), cefazolin (7.2%), lincomycin-spectinomy-
cin (5.8%), and norﬂoxacin (0.7%) (Table 2).

Multidrug resistance in Salmonella. Among the 138
Salmonella isolates, 72 (52.2%) were considered multidrug
resistant
to three or more antimicrobial
agents), and 39 patterns of multidrug resistance were found.

a A total of 138 Salmonella isolates were recovered.

Only seven isolates (three of Salmonella Braenderup, two of
Salmonella Enteritidis, and one each of Salmonella Albany
and Salmonella Brunei) were susceptible to all 12
antimicrobial agents. One isolate (Salmonella Indiana) was
resistant to 10 antimicrobial agents among the eight groups
of antimicrobial agents (Table 2).

Salmonella serovars. Twenty-four serovars were
identiﬁed among the 138 Salmonella isolates. The most
commonly identiﬁed serovars were Salmonella Albany (53
followed by Salmonella Kentucky (15
isolates; 38%)
isolates; 11%), Salmonella Braenderup (14 isolates; 10%),
and Salmonella Indiana (11 isolates; 8%) (Table 3).

Risk factors. Overall, no signiﬁcant associations
between risky or unhygienic practices in the shops (Table
1) and the presence of Salmonella on chicken meat were
found. Items for which responses were 100% negative or
100% positive were not included in Table 1. All shops were
retail shops, and none had an established pest control
system. Meat was transported to the shops and stored there
at ambient
temperature, and meat was handed over to
consumers without any cover or wrapping. No water and
towels were available in the shops to allow cleaning of
workers’ hands. Protective gloves were not used.

DISCUSSION

Prevalence of Salmonella. The prevalence of Salmo-
nella in chicken meat from retail markets in Yangon,
Myanmar, was clearly higher than that recently reported in
four studies in China and Vietnam, with 43.3, 52.2, 45.9,
and 48.7% Salmonella-positive chicken carcasses (25, 26,
28, 31). In a previous study in Myanmar, the proportion of
Salmonella-positive chicken samples was 4% in ﬁve A-
grade markets in the Yangon region in 2005 (13) but was
72.5 and 90% in chicken samples in the Mandalay region in
2009 (11, 21). Similar results (68%) were reported for beef
samples in Mandalay in 2012 (27). However, different types

950

of meat samples and isolation methods complicate compar-
isons. Although sampling a whole carcass (25, 26, 28, 31)
may be more sensitive for recovering Salmonella than
sampling only one piece of meat with the skin on (as done in
the recovery of Salmonella from 97.9% of
our study),
samples indicates that either Salmonella levels per carcass
were high or that contamination of meat occurred during
portioning by the staff (25).

isolates was comparable to that

Antimicrobial resistance. Resistance to trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole was found in 70.3% of the isolates of this
study. This ﬁnding corresponds closely to the 74.4%
resistance to cotrimoxazole reported previously (21) but
was three times higher than the cotrimoxazole resistance
reported among Salmonella isolates from beef (27), with
24.4% in Myanmar, and about double (34.6%) that reported
in a study in Vietnam (26). Resistance to tetracycline was
found in 54.3% of the isolates, which was about half the
prevalence reported in previous studies in Myanmar (100%)
(13, 21, 27). Because of these high resistance rates reported
for 2005 to 2009, the use of tetracyclines has been reduced
in poultry production, which may account for the decline in
resistance we observed in Myanmar. The percentage of
resistant
reported for
Salmonella on chicken meat in Vietnam (59.1%) (26) but
was signiﬁcantly lower than that recently reported in China
(71.1%) (28). Salmonella resistance to ciproﬂoxacin was
low, i.e., 9.4% in this study, similar to the 7.3% reported in
2012 (27), but was considerable lower
than the rates
reported in a 2009 study (87.2%) (21) in Myanmar and
less than half that found in a previous study in China
(22.5%) (28). Regarding resistance to quinolones, which are
the principal antimicrobial agents used in the treatment of
human salmonellosis, our study revealed the prevalence of
resistance of 9.4% to ciproﬂoxacin and 0.7% to norﬂoxacin,
much lower than the prevalences reported in the European
Union (11 to 100%) (8), China (12.1%) (29), and Thailand
(27.27%) (1). Reduced susceptibility to ciproﬂoxacin among
Salmonella clinical
isolates have been reported for the
Philippines (15% of isolates resistant), Singapore (25%
resistant), and Thailand (46.2% resistant) (17).

Regarding multidrug resistance, the percentage of the
resistant isolates that were multidrug resistant (i.e., 52.2%)
was quite comparable to that reported for Vietnam (57%)
(26) but lower than that reported for China (77%) (28).
When compared with European Union data, our results rank
in an intermediate position; the percentages of multidrug-
resistant Salmonella isolates were sometimes lower, e.g., in
France (2.4%), Spain (11.5%), and Germany (14.6%), but
sometimes higher, e.g., in Hungary (78.7%) and Slovenia
(93.3%) (8).

This study was the ﬁrst comprehensive and detailed
examination of Salmonella serovars in Myanmar. Among
138 Salmonella isolates, 24 Salmonella serovars were
identiﬁed. The four most frequently identiﬁed Salmonella
serovars were Albany, Kentucky, Braenderup, and Indiana,
accounting for 38, 11, 10, and 8% of isolates, respectively.
Salmonella Albany was the most
frequently observed
serovar in the present study, at a prevalence similar to that

reported in Vietnam (34.1%) (26), whereas Salmonella
Typhimurium and Salmonella Enteritidis were predominant
serovars in many other studies (9, 15, 25, 28, 30).

In previous work from 2005 in Myanmar (13), only a
few isolates were tested, and Salmonella serovars Enter-
itidis, Newport, Pullorum, and Senftenberg accounted for 2,
1, 1, and 1 of the 6 isolates, respectively. In contrast, in our
study, Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Newport
accounted for merely 2 and 1% of isolates; Salmonella
Pullorum and Salmonella Senftenberg were not detected.

raw meats, with lack of

Risk factors. In this study, none of the practices
evaluated in retail shops were identiﬁed as signiﬁcant risk
factors for the presence of Salmonella, despite the large
number of items checked (Table 1). The hygienic conditions
observed are not unexpected for ‘‘wet’’ markets with a quick
turnover of
refrigeration and
shortcomings in sanitation facilitating growth and persis-
tence of foodborne pathogens. These conditions may explain
the high proportion of Salmonella-positive samples. Clean-
ing of utensils with potable water, covering meat, and other
hygienic practices seem to be associated with lower
Salmonella prevalence in chicken at retail (wet) markets
(31).

Further studies should help determine whether contam-
ination of chicken meat in these markets is due to the nearly
ubiquitous presence of this pathogen in these locations or
whether chicken meat was contaminated before it arrived at
the markets. Because poultry was slaughtered in only 18%
(25 of 141) of the markets studied, the majority of chicken
carcasses must have come from slaughter facilities outside
the markets. Thus, a high prevalence of Salmonella carriage
in the live poultry chain and of contamination events at the
slaughter facilities or the retail shops might have contributed
to the outcomes reported here.
