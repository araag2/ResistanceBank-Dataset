Abstract

Background: Intensification of livestock production seen in many low- and middle-income countries is often
believed to be associated with increased use of antimicrobials, and may hence contribute to the emergence of
antimicrobial resistance. The aim of this study was to map antimicrobial use on small- (n = 25) and medium-scale
(n = 27) pig farms in north-eastern Thailand, and to compare antimicrobial susceptibility of commensal Escherichia
coli isolated from sows on these farms.
Methods: Information regarding pig husbandry and antimicrobial treatment regimens was obtained by the use of
semi-structured questionnaires. Faecal samples were collected from three healthy sows at each farm, and Escherichia coli
was cultured and analysed for antimicrobial susceptibility using the broth microdilution method. Multilevel regression
models were used to compare antimicrobial susceptibility between isolates from small- and medium-scale farms.
Results: All farms included in the study administered antimicrobials to their sows. Small-scale farmers most commonly
(64%) decided themselves when to give antimicrobials and the majority (60%) bought the medicines at the local store or
pharmacy, whereas farmers on medium-scale farms always discussed antimicrobial treatment with a veterinarian.
Medium-scale farms used a greater diversity of antimicrobials than small-scale farms and did also administer
antimicrobials in feed to a higher extent. High levels of antimicrobial resistance to several critically important
antimicrobials for human medicine (including ciprofloxacin, streptomycin and ampicillin) were found in isolates
from both small- and medium-scale farms. Resistance levels were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in isolates from
medium-scale farms for several of the antimicrobials tested, as well as the level of multidrug-resistance (P = 0.026).
Conclusion: The routines regarding access and administration of antimicrobials differed between the small- and
medium-scale farms. Although the level of antimicrobial resistance, as well as multidrug-resistance, was higher in
isolates from medium-scale farms, it cannot be concluded if this increase is a consequence of a more abundant
use of antimicrobials, or a result of differences in administration routines.

Background
The emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has
become a serious global health concern, and imprudent
use of antimicrobials has been recognized as a contributing
factor in the selection for resistant bacterial populations [1].
Although much of the resistance seen in human medicine
originates from inappropriate use in humans [2], antimicro-
bial use within the livestock sector is believed to contribute
to AMR through increased selective pressure and through
generating resistance reservoirs [3, 4].

The level of AMR has been shown to be highest in
low- and middle-income countries, particularly those in
South and Southeast Asia [5]. In Thailand, infections with
antimicrobial resistant bacteria in humans have been esti-
mated to be the cause of almost 90,000 hospitalisations
and 38,000 mortalities each year [6], and high levels of
resistance have been documented in the environment and
along the food production chain [7].

As Escherichia coli are intestinal commensal bacteria
present in both animals and humans, and therefore sub-
jected to a high selection pressure driven by the antimi-
crobials to which their hosts are exposed, they may serve
as a good indicator to monitor the general level of AMR
in a human or livestock population [8]. Also, although
commensal bacteria are normally harmless, they may con-
stitute a reservoir of resistance genes that may be trans-
mitted to pathogenic bacteria [9].

Today’s intensive livestock production often depends
on antimicrobials to maintain the health and productivity
of the livestock [10]. Antimicrobials are not only used to
treat infectious diseases, but are also sometimes used sub-
therapeutically for growth promotion, a practice associated
with a high potential for selection of resistant pathogens
[11]. Intensification of livestock production in many low-
and middle-income countries, as exemplified by Thailand’s
pig sector [12, 13], is often believed to be driving an in-
creased use of antimicrobials and thereby also an increased
emergence of AMR [10, 14]. Here we explored the validity
of that assertion in a country with an expanding pig sector.
We therefore investigated antimicrobial use on small- and
medium-scale pig farms in north-eastern Thailand, and
compared antimicrobial susceptibility of commensal E. coli
isolated from sows on these farms.

Methods
Study area
This cross-sectional study was conducted on small- and
medium-scale pig farms situated near the city Khon
Kaen in north-eastern Thailand. In 2013, the country
produced more than 16 million pigs for slaughter [12].
Among the 220,000 households that raised pigs, 94%
raised less than 50 pigs per year. On the other hand, two
large companies owned about 46% of all breeder pigs.
Currently,
about 200 such contractual,

there

are

company-owned pig farms in the Khon Kaen province
and the density of the total number of pigs, as well as
small - scale farms (less than 50 heads per farm), are about
the averages for the provinces in Thailand [13]. In the last
decade, Thailand’s pig sector has intensified and farm sizes
have increased; a trend that is expected to continue [13].

Study design and data collection
The study was conducted between September and
November 2015. Inclusion criteria for small-scale farms
were that the farm kept sows for breeding, with a max-
imum of 20 sows, whereas medium-scale farms were
defined as farms with between 100 and 500 sows, a classi-
fication relating to previous work in Thailand where such
farms have been named “smallholders” and “small large-
scale farms”, respectively [13]. In order to make a distinct
difference in size between the small- and medium-scale
farms in the present study, no farms with 21–99 sows
were included. From a governmental list of villages with
pig farm(s), the heads in randomly selected villages were
contacted for checking that there were pig farms at the
time of the fieldwork. The villages with positive responses
were visited and all farms where the farmers were at home
agreed to participate. For the medium-scale farms, that all
but one belonged to two companies, the company officers
were asked to make a choice of farms to be equally distrib-
uted over the province. By this procedure, 25 small-scale
and 27 medium-scale farms were included in the study.

A faecal sample was collected, using a rectal swab, from
the individual pen of three randomly chosen healthy sows
at each farm and added to sterile plastic tubes containing
Amies medium. At the small-scale farms, sampling was
performed by the authors (MH, DK), and at the medium-
scale farms by local veterinary assistants who were thor-
oughly instructed beforehand how to collect the samples
in a correct manner. Sampling was performed at mid-day
and samples were transported to Khon Kaen University
within 1–6 h and stored at 2-8 °C until analysis, which
was performed within 48 h after sampling. Because not
all small-scale farms had three healthy sows, only 69
samples were obtained from these farms.

A semi-structured questionnaire, with questions on
farm characteristics, pig husbandry and routines for
antimicrobial treatment, was administered to the per-
son responsible for the pigs at each farm. The question-
naire was in English and had been pre-tested on pig
farms not involved in the subsequent study, after which
necessary adjustments were made. Interviews were per-
formed by the authors MH and DK together with a
Thai speaking veterinary student at the Khon Kaen
University who translated the questions to Thai and the
farmer’s answers to English. The interviews took about
40 min each.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
Each faecal sample was streaked on MacConkey agar
and incubated at 44 °C overnight. Suspected E. coli isolates
were sub-cultured on blood agar, incubated at 37 °C over-
night and tested for production of tryptophanase (indole).
One indole positive isolate was selected from each faecal
sample and further tested for antimicrobial susceptibility.

Susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdi-
lution, using the growth method inoculum preparation,
according to the standards described by the Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [15]. Microdilution
panels (VetMIC GN-mo, National Veterinary Institute,
Uppsala, Sweden) were used to determine susceptibility
to 13 antimicrobials (ciprofloxacin, nalidixid acid, gentami-
cin, streptomycin, tetracycline, florfenicol, chloramphenicol,
colistin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ampicillin, cefo-
taxime, ceftazidime). Escherichia. coli ATCC 25922 was
used as quality control strain.

The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) for each
antimicrobial was recorded and epidemiological cut-off
values (ECOFFs), defined by the European Committee on
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing [16], were used to dif-
ferentiate between wild-type and non-wild-type isolates.
Wild-type and non-wild-type isolates will henceforth
be referred to as susceptible and resistant, respectively.
Multidrug-resistance was defined as isolates resistant
to at least three different categories (i.e. with different
mechanisms of action) of the antimicrobials tested [17].

Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were conducted in SAS software 9.4
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Descriptive statistics were
computed to define farm characteristics. To investigate
associations between management factors, such as use
of antimicrobials and veterinary services, and resistance
against different types of antimicrobials, univariable lo-
gistic regression and Fisher’s exact test were used where
applicable. Multilevel regression models were used to
compare susceptibility patterns between the small- and
medium-scale farms. As isolates from the same farm
were assumed to be more alike, generalised estimating
equations (GEE) were used to account for the effect of
clustering within farms. The statistical significance level
was defined as a two-tailed P-value <0.05.

were sold to other farmers after weaning, or farms that
practised a combination of the two systems (12%).

The medium-scale farms in this study, except for one
farm that was privately owned and managed, were con-
tract farms contracted by two different companies. The
number of sows ranged from 100 to 400, with a median
number of 210 sows (25th and 95th percentiles: 155 and
327 sows). All medium-scale farms were breeding farms,
and the privately managed farm also combined this with
a ‘farrow-to-finish’ system.

None of the farms in this study kept their pigs freely
roaming; instead the pigs were kept in enclosures, such
as concrete pens or metal crates.

Antimicrobial use
All farms in this study administered antimicrobials to
their sows, though only 21 of the 25 small-scale farms
knew the names of the antimicrobials used. Small-scale
farmers most commonly decided themselves when to
give antimicrobials and the majority bought the drugs at
the local store or pharmacy (Table 1). On all medium-
scale farms, the farmer discussed with a veterinarian when
to give antimicrobials to the animals, and the contract
farms received the antimicrobials through their respective
contracting company. The privately managed medium-
scale farm received antimicrobials through a pharmaceut-
ical company. Furthermore, antimicrobials were added to
the feed on all medium-scale farms, a practice that was
performed on only one of the small-scale farms.

The number and types of antimicrobials used differed
between small- and medium-scale farms (Table 2). Penicillin
and streptomycin were used as injectable drugs on all the
medium-scale farms, compared to only 19% of the small-
scale farms. Small-scale farms most commonly used amoxi-
cillin (38%) and enrofloxacin (57%) as injectable drugs. For
the contract farms, the two contracting companies had

Farm characteristics
At the small-scale farms, all privately owned, the number of

and 95th percentiles: 3 and 12 sows). Most of these farms
(60%) practised a ‘farrow-to-finish’ system, where pigs were
raised from birth to slaughter. The rest of the small-scale
farms were either breeding farms (28%), where the piglets

different regimes regarding treatment with antimicrobials.
Both companies provided penicillin and streptomycin as
injectable drugs to their contract farms, and one of the com-
panies also provided enrofloxacin. The companies either
provided kitasamycin or oxytetracycline as in-feed antimi-
crobials to their respective farms. On the privately managed
medium-scale farm, penicillin, streptomycin, amoxicillin,
oxytetracycline and cefotaxime were administered by injec-
tion, and amoxicillin and colistin were provided with the
feed. Unfortunately, no information regarding the amount
of antimicrobials used could be obtained in this study.

Antimicrobial susceptibility
In total, 69 and 81 isolates were obtained from the small-
and medium-scale farms, respectively. Around 90% (62/
69) of isolates from the small-scale farms showed resist-
ance to at least one category of antimicrobials. The corre-
sponding figure for medium-scale farms was 98% (79/81).
The MIC distributions for isolates from the small- and
medium-scale farms are presented in Tables 3 and 4,
respectively.

For both small- and medium-scale farms, most isolates
showed resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline and sulfa-
methoxazole, ranging from 61% to 86% (for details see
Table 5). No isolates showed resistance to colistin, and
only a few isolates were resistant to the third generation
cephalosporins cefotaxime and ceftazidime. Isolates ob-
tained from medium-scale farms were significantly more
likely to be resistant to streptomycin (P < 0.001), sulfa-
methoxazole (P = 0.006), trimethoprim (P < 0.001) and
chloramphenicol (P = 0.023), compared to isolates from
small-scale farms. Multidrug-resistance was more com-
mon (P = 0.026) in isolates from medium-scale farms
(89%), than in isolates from small-scale farms (74%).

Isolates obtained from farms that used enrofloxacin
were more likely to show resistance to ciprofloxacin
(P = 0.02), but not to nalidixic acid (P = 0.47). Moreover,
all isolates from medium-scale farms that administered
oxytetracycline in the feed were resistant to tetracycline.

Discussion
The overall aim of this study was to investigate possible
differences in antimicrobial use in pigs on small- and
medium-scale pig farms in Thailand, a country that is
experiencing an intensification of the pig sector,
like
other countries in the region [13]. Furthermore, we
compared antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates of E.
coli from pigs on these farms. This research question
stems from the common assertion that farm intensifica-
tion, in particular in the pig and poultry sectors, is as-
sociated with a more abundant use of antimicrobials,
and thereby also with higher levels of antimicrobial
resistance (AMR) [10, 14].

The levels of AMR presented here are largely similar
to those in previous studies on E. coli
isolated from
animals in Southeast Asia, according to a recent review
by Nhung et al. [18]. The highest frequencies of resist-
ance in isolates from both small- and medium-scale
farms were found against tetracycline, followed by ampicil-
lin. Multidrug-resistance was significantly more commonly
observed in isolates from pigs on medium- compared to
small-scale farms. These results are in accordance with a
study by Love et al. [19], where herd size was reported to
be positively associated with higher rates of multidrug-
resistance in E. coli
isolated on pig farms in northern
Thailand. Although the medium-scale farms in the present
study routinely used a greater diversity of antimicrobials,
we do not have any reliable information regarding the
amounts of antimicrobials used on the farms. Therefore, no
associations between the amounts of administrated antimi-
crobials and AMR can be determined here.

Penicillin and streptomycin were used on all medium-
scale farms, whereas small-scale farms most commonly
used enrofloxacin and amoxicillin. Enrofloxacin was also
used on almost half of the medium-scale farms. Although
this antimicrobial is not used in human medicine, being a
quinolone its use in animals selects for resistance to other
quinolones that are used for humans. Here we found a
positive association between the use of enrofloxacin on
the farm and ciprofloxacin resistance in isolates of E. coli
from the pigs, which indicates the importance of restrict-
ing the use of quinolones in animal agriculture. These
results are in accordance with studies conducted on pig
and chicken farms in Vietnam [20, 21].

Many of the antimicrobials used by the farms in this
study are classified by the World Health Organization
(WHO) as critically important for human medicine [22],
including amoxicillin, cefotaxime and colistin. The recent
discovery of the plasmid mediated mcr-1 gene in bacteria
isolated from pigs [23], a gene that confers resistance to
colistin and that may be transferred horizontally between
bacteria, has emphasised the importance of colistin as a
last-resort antimicrobial that should possibly be restricted
to human use. Plasmid-mediated colistin resistance has
since been detected in almost all regions of the world [24],
including in bacteria isolated from Vietnamese pigs
[20, 25]. None of the isolates in the present study,
however, were resistant to colistin, and it was only
used on one of the study farms.

Data presented in this study indicate that medium-scale
farms administer antimicrobials to the feed to a higher
extent than small-scale farms. Oral administration of anti-
microbials is known to increase AMR in E. coli from pigs
[26]. A possible explanation to the higher use of antimi-
crobials in feed on the medium-scale farms in this study
could be that these farms experience an increased disease
pressure that is associated with larger group sizes and

higher densities of animals [27], or simply that these farms
were more commercially oriented and therefore pursued
better animal performance and higher returns from
production. We do not have information whether these
antimicrobials were intended to promote growth or to
prevent sickness in the animals, therefore these are only
speculations. However, Thailand recently, as the first
country in the region, banned the inclusion of antimi-
crobials as growth promotors in animal agriculture

[28], which is an important step towards a more pru-
dent use of antimicrobials.

We found a difference between the ways in which
small- and medium-scale farms accessed antimicrobials,
where the latter always consulted a veterinarian before
treating sick animals. This difference, that must be inter-
preted with caution given the sample size, might how-
ever not be resulting from increased farm size, but could
merely be a consequence of that the medium-scale farms

were bound to the routines of the contracting companies,
as this was the case for all but one of the medium-scale
farms. The two contracting companies, owning about half
each of the medium-scale farms in the current study, are
very large companies that have operations all over the
country, and one may thus assume that the regimes re-
garding antimicrobial treatment presented here are repre-
sentative for many medium-scale farms in Thailand.

In this study the emphasis was on antimicrobial use
and susceptibility in commensal E. coli collected from
sows. Sows were sampled as antimicrobial use and re-
sistance in E. coli from sows is of epidemiological im-
portance within the herd, as the sow may serve as a
reservoir of resistant bacteria and genetic determinants
[29]. Whilst the recommendation by the European Food
Safety Authority (EFSA) [30] is that samples should be
taken from fattener pigs, the approach adopted here was
to ensure sufficient number of pigs to sample at each
farm, as small-scale farms might not have enough fat-
teners at the time of visit.

As already mentioned we found a positive association
between enrofloxacin use and ciprofloxacin resistance,
both being fluoroquinolones used in veterinary and
human medicine, respectively. Our analyses also re-
vealed some associations between the use of certain
antimicrobials and AMR. Such associations should be
interpreted with caution, especially since this study
contained relatively few farms and the fact that we
could not obtain reliable information from all farms
regarding precise treatment regimes, e.g. duration and
dosage. Thus, assessing possible associations between

the treatment regime and antimicrobial resistance
might fall outside the power of this study.

The data from the current study have been interpreted
conservatively given the relatively small sample size. An-
other limitation to take into account when reading the
paper is that the selection of farms might not be regarded
as entirely random. The antimicrobial activity testing
panel used is designed to detect resistance among E. coli,
therefore there may be resistance in other bacterial species
and to other antimicrobials not tested for in this study.

Conclusions
Considerable reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance were
observed in E. coli from pigs on both small- and medium-
scale farms in north-eastern Thailand. Higher rates of
resistance, including multidrug-resistance, were observed
on medium-scale farms, which could be a consequence of
the greater diversity of antimicrobials used on these farms,
as well as of the higher extent to which antimicrobials
were administered in the feed. Although we found differ-
ences in how antimicrobials were accessed and adminis-
tered between the small- and medium-scale farms,
it
cannot be concluded whether these differences could be
responsible for the higher rate of antimicrobial resistance
observed on the medium-scale farms.
