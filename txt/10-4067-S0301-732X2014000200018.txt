SUMMARY

The aim of this work was to identify and to characterise Staphylococcus aureus isolates associated with subclinical mastitis obtained from milk of 
lactating cows showing a California Mastitis Test (CMT) score result of traces, 1, 2 or 3. Coagulase, hemolysis, presence of capsule, slime formation, 
biofilm production, autoaggregation, hemagglutination and antibiotic susceptibility were assessed to evaluate S. aureus virulence factors expression 
potentially associated to bovine subclinical mastitis isolates. Prevalence of subclinical mastitis along the study was low and did not correlate with months 
or climatic variables. Most of S. aureus (20) were isolated from milk samples showing a CMT score result of 1. Formation of capsule, slime, biofilms 
and the occurrence of bacteria aggregation in all the tested isolates converged in the bacterial ability of adherence and persistence in the mammary gland 
and probably contribute to the further chronicity of the infection and even the colonization of dairy installations. Resistance against a set of commonly 
used antibiotics was low. The evaluation of virulence factors of S. aureus isolates in the context of subclinical mastitis in dairy farms may be useful to 
develop precise actions and treatments to control mastitis and to improve animal health and milk production in dairy bovine herds.

RESUMEN

El  objetivo  de  este  trabajo  fue  evaluar  la  prevalencia  y  evolución    de  mastitis  bovina  subclínica  (MBS)  a  lo  largo  de  un  año  en  dos  tambos 
comerciales localizados en un área de producción lechera (Sur) de Uruguay e identificar y caracterizar cepas de Staphylococcus aureus aisladas de la 
leche de vacas con resultados de trazas, 1, 2 o 3 correspondientes a la escala del California Mastitis Test (CMT). Producción de coagulasa, presencia 
de cápsula, producción de limo, formación de biofilms, autoagregación, hemaglutinación y sensibilidad a diferentes antibióticos fueron evaluadas en el 
caso de las cepas de S. aureus aisladas. La incidencia de MBS a lo largo del estudio fue baja y no se correlacionó con variables climáticas. El número 
de aislamientos de S. aureus de las muestras de leche fue bajo en comparación con estudios previos y la mayoría de ellos se obtuvo de muestras que 
presentaban un resultado de CMT de 1. La formación de cápsula, limo y biofilms así como la ocurrencia de autoagregación en todas las cepas confluyen 
en la habilidad bacteriana para adherirse y persistir en la glándula contribuyendo a la cronicidad de la infección y a la adhesión a superficies inertes. 
La resistencia bacteriana frente a distintos antibióticos fue baja. La evaluación de la expresión de factores de virulencia de S. aureus en el contexto de 
mastitis subclínica en tambos puede ser de utilidad para desarrollar acciones precisas y tratamientos para el control de mastitis y la promoción de la 
salud animal y la producción de leche.

INTRODUCTION

Staphylococcus aureus is a natural inhabitant of hu-
man and animal skin and mucosal epithelia. It is extre-
mely versatile, it causes a broad range of diseases and it 
is the most common etiologic agent of bovine contagious 
mastitis (Kerro Dego et al 2002), which is still the most 
costly disease for dairy farmers worldwide (Cressier and

Bissonnette 2011). This bacterium expresses a high num-
ber of virulence factors that vary among strains, potentia-
lly associated with the establishment and pathogenesis of 
intrammamary inflammation (IMI).

Staphylococcal mastitis causes clinical and subclinical 
IMI which may persist along successive lactation periods. 
S. aureus has the ability to acquire resistance to antimi-
crobial drugs, making treatment difficult and often unsuc-
cessful (Sommerhauser et al 2003). Prevalence of antimi-
crobial-resistant strains isolated from mastitic ruminants 
is a serious problem worldwide (Kumar et al 2011).

The importance of assessing the presence and com-
bination of virulence factors associated to the mammary

gland  infection  has  been  recently  emphasised  by  diffe-
rent  authors  and  support  the  idea  that  the  development 
of subclinical mastitis could be related to strain-specific 
pathogenic attributes (Zecconi et al 2006).

The aim of this study was to identify and characterise 
S. aureus isolates associated with subclinical mastitis in 
two commercial dairy herds located in the dairy produc-
tion geographic area of Uruguay (South), obtained from 
milk of affected cows. Expression of virulence factors by 
the different isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility pat-
terns were assessed. 

strains  were ATCC  29213  (Boerlin  et  al  2003), ATCC 
25923  (Kateete  et  al  2010)  and ATCC  6538  (O´Reilly 
et al 2000). Escherichia coli (Delucchi et al 2008) and 
Moraxella bovoculi (Marrs et al 1985) were also used as 
controls for different tests of this study.

COAgULASE TEST 

Coagulase activity was determined in tubes (tube coa-
gulase test, TC) as described by Quinn et al (2004) and 
examined after 4 and 24 h. 

MATERIAL AND METhODS

DNASE TEST

COwS

The study was conducted between May 2008 to April 
2009  in  two  dairy  farms  of  Southern  Uruguay,  located 
close to the cities of Pando and Libertad. Somatic cells 
count  recorded  in  bulk  milk  were  lower  than  200,000 
cells mL-1, despite a reasonably good udder health ma-
nagement. Cows, mostly grazed on pasture, were milked 
twice  a  day.  Both  herds  had  an  annual  record  of  about 
1,500 L of milk per day.

MILK SAMPLINg

All milking cows were tested monthly using the Ca-
lifornia Mastitis Test (CMT), a simple and widely used 
tool  to  detect  subclinical  mastitis  (Persson  et  al  2011), 
which yields an ordinal variable related with the increase 
of milk somatic cell counts (SCC) as a consequence of 
udder inflammation (Feitosa Brito et al 1997). Quarters 
that  showed  CMT  detectable  values  (traces,  1,  2  or  3, 
according to the intensity of the reaction) were sampled 
and  the  milk  was  submitted  for  bacterial  culture.  Milk 
samples were collected according to the National Masti-
tis Council guidelines (National Mastitis Council 1981).

BACTERIAL ISOLATION 

Milk  samples  were  streaked  onto  5%  sheep  Blood 
Agar1,  2  (BA)  and  Baird  Parker Agar2  (BPA)  plates  and 
incubated aerobically at 37 ºC for 24-48 h. Staphylococci 
were identified on the basis of gram staining and cultu-
ral  characteristics  such  as  pigment  production,  haemo-
lysis  and  the  following  biochemical  reactions:  catalase 
activity, tube coagulase test (TC), mannitol fermentation 
on Mannitol-Salt Agar1, deoxyribonuclease1 (DNase) test 
and Voges Proskauer (VP) test using VP broth1 (Rober-
son et al 1992, Boerlin et al 2003). S. aureus reference

This  test  was  carried  out  by  using  commercially 
available DNase agar. Spot inoculation was done on the 
DNase agar plates and incubated at 37 ºC for 1 day. Af-
ter incubation, clearing around the bacterial growth was 
evaluated as positive.

CAPSULE TEST

The  presence  of  bacterial  capsule  was  determined 
following the microscopic method described by Türkyil-
maz and Kaya (2006).

SLIME FORMATION

The  Congo  Red Agar  (CRA)  method  developed  by 
Freeman  was  used  in  this  assay  (Türkyilmaz  and  Kaya 
2006). Isolates producing black colonies were regarded 
as  slime-positive.  Those  showing  pink  colonies  were 
considered as slime-negative isolates.

BIOFILM FORMATION 

Isolates  were  incubated  on  TSA  blood  agar  plates 
for 18 h at 37ºC under aerobic conditions. Fresh cultures 
were  inoculated  in  5  mL  of  TSB  glucose  (0.25%)  and 
then incubated at 37ºC for 24 h under the same condi-
tions. Biofilm formation was assessed by the microplate 
method (MP) proposed by Pfaller et al (1988) using 96 
wells tissue culture plates. The plates were read using an 
automated plate reader (Varioscan Flash 4.00.51) at 600 
nm. Sterile TSB was used as a negative control. All the 
experiments were performed using four replicates. Bio-
film production was tested following the criteria propo-
sed by Mathur et al (2006).

hEMOLySIS 

hemolysis was evaluated on TSA plates supplemen-
ted with 10% sterile sheep blood. The plates were incuba-
ted for 24 h at 37 ºC, and then overnight at 4 ºC. Results 
were considered positive when a clear zone of complete 
hemolysis was detected around the colonies.

hEMAggLUTINATION

The  hemagglutination  assay  was  performed  accor-
ding to the method described by Rupp and Archer (1992) 
with modifications. Bacterial concentrations were adjus-
ted using a McFarland standard of 0.5 which correlated 
approximately with 108 bacteria per mL. hemagglutina-
tion assays were carried out in 96-well (U-shaped) mi-
crotiter  plates  (Costar,  Cambridge,  Mass.).  The  plates 
were  sealed  with  laboratory  film  and  shaken  to  ensure 
even  mixing  of  the  bacteria  and  erythrocytes,  and  then 
incubated at 4 ºC for 2 h. hemagglutination was recorded 
as positive when erythrocyte clumps were seen. Negative 
and positive controls were included in the assay.

AUTOAggREgATION

Isolates  were  incubated  on  TSA  blood  agar  plates 
for 18 h at 37ºC under aerobic conditions. Fresh cultures 
were  inoculated  in  5  mL  of  TSB  glucose  (0.25%)  and 
then incubated at 37ºC for 24 h at the same conditions. 
Aliquots of 5 μL of the suspensions were transferred to 
5 mL of TSB glucose which were incubated 48 h at the 
same conditions. Then, the cultures were incubated 24 h 
at 4º C.

200 μL were extracted from the surface of each tube 
of  culture  and  transferred  to  a  96-well  (U-shaped)  mi-
crotiter plate (Costar, Cambridge, Mass.). Initial Optical 
Density (OD) was read at 600 nm. After this, tubes were 
vortexed during 30 sec and 200 μL of the cultures were 
transferred to a 96-well (U-shaped) microtiter plate. Fi-
nal OD was read at 600 nm. Autoaggregation percenta-
ge was calculated as: A= (1-ODf/ODi) x 100, where A: 
Autoaggregation percentage; ODf: Final Optical Density, 
and ODi: Initial Optical Density.

Kruskall-wallis test between strains, and Mann-whitney 
for strain classification. These procedures were followed 
by modified Bray-Curtis association index to find strains 
with similar behaviour for these two variables. All tho-
se procedures were performed by using PAST software 
(hammer et al 2001); P values < 0.05 were considered 
significant. 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

PREVALENCE OF SUBCLINICAL MASTITIS 

Considering  the  total  cow  populations  of  both  dairy 
farms, the percentage of animals that showed a detectable 
CMT category was 8 and 19% in the cases of Libertad and 
Pando,  respectively.  Distribution  along  the  year  did  not 
show a defined pattern and was neither related to clima-
tic variables like temperature, rain or humidity (data not 
shown). The subclinical mastitis prevalence recorded by 
CMT was higher in one of the farms (Pando) compared to 
the other located close to Libertad. This could be related to 
hygiene practices that were poorer in the Pando farm com-
pared to the other one in Libertad. however, prevalence 
results could be considered acceptable compared to pre-
vious studies (gianneechini et al 2002, Plozza et al 2011).
Most of the S. aureus isolates corresponded to milk 
samples  that  showed  a  grade  1  CMT  result  (16  out  of 
20)  while  the  remaining  four  were  isolated  from  milk 
samples  that  corresponded  to  grade  2  (1),  grade  3  (1) 
and traces (2) CMT categories. The vast majority of the 
identified  S.  aureus  corresponded  to  milk  samples  that 
showed a grade 1 CMT category (16 out of 20, 80%). 
This indicated that S. aureus was predominantly isolated 
from animals that suffered a mild udder inflammation, re-
sult that may be taken into account for control strategies.

ANTIBIOTIC SUSCEPTIBILITy PATTERNS 

BACTERIAL IDENTIFICATION

The  Kirby-Bauer  disk  diffusion  method  (Bauer 
et  al  1966)  was  used  to  determine  resistance  of  S.  au-
reus  to  Trimethoprim–Sulfametoxazole,  gentamicine, 
Neomycin, Penicillin, Nafcillin, Clindamycin and Cipro-
floxacin. Zones of inhibition were recorded at 24 and 48 
h and the isolates were considered susceptible, interme-
diately resistant, or resistant to each antibiotic according 
to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Stan-
dards (NCCLS 1997, gandara et al 2006). 

STATISTICAL ANALySIS

In order to identify S. aureus isolates, a Cluster analy-
sis using de Ochiai index simultaneously to strains and 
to variables (coagulase, hemolysis, VP, mannitol fermen-
tation,  DNAse,  BPA)  was  performed.  To  compare  bio-
film production and autoaggregation (as percentage) an 
Exploratory  Data Analysis  was  performed  followed  by 

A  total  of  508  milk  samples  showed  a  CMT  detec-
table result and 63 isolates were characterised as gram 
positive cocci and positive to catalase production. 20 of 
these isolates showed coagulase activity and developed a 
firm clot in the coagulase test tube (TC) at 4 hours and  
at 24 h the clot was seen in 22 isolates. Of these 22, 20 
showed  a  consistent  color  change  according  to VP  test 
positive  reaction  and  were  considered  S.  aureus. These 
20 isolates showed hemolysis, DNAse activity and grew 
well on MSA; 19 of them were able to ferment manni-
tol, which was evidenced by a color change in the MSA 
plates around the colonies. All strains grew on BP plates 
showing a characteristic morphology and dimensions but 
nevertheless only 12 showed a halo of lipolysis. The two 
remaining  isolates  were  identified  as  coagulase  positi-
ve Staphylococcus other than S. aureus. 3 out of the 41 
isolates of gram positive cocci without catalase activity 
did not evidence coagulase activity but showed a positive 

317

DE LOS SANTOS ET AL

oxidase test. These isolates belonged to the Micrococcus 
genus while the rest (38) were considered coagulase-ne-
gative staphylococci (CNS).

Isolates showed a positive coagulase-test result after 
4 h of incubation. Isolate 20080849 was the only one that 
did not acidified MSA plates.

Identification of bacterial pathogens still relies mainly 
on phenotypic criteria due to costs and simplicity of the 
methods. Among coagulase-positive staphylococci, S. au-
reus  is  almost  the  only  one  with  hemolytic  activity  that 
is regularly found in milk samples (Roberson et al 1992, 
Larsen et al 2002). Therefore, a combination of hemoly-
sis and coagulase activities seems to represent an optimal 
criterion for the identification of S. aureus in cultures from 
milk samples (Boerlin et al 2003). 

PRESENCE OF CAPSULE, SLIME PRODUCTION AND 
hEMAggLUTINATION

All S. aureus isolates formed capsule and produced 
slime  on  CRA.  Only  7  strains  (excluding ATCC  6835 
and 25923 strains used as positive controls) were able to 
agglutinate ovine red blood cells. Expression of capsule 
by S. aureus associated to IMI has been clearly demons-
trated but this is not a constant (Buzzola et al 2007). In 
this study, we must consider that milk samples belonged 
to animals with subclinical mastitis. The presence of cap-
sule enables to resist and evade successfully the first de-
fense line of the host, even triggering different degrees of 
inflammation as seen in the CMT tests.

BIOFILM FORMATION

The  S.  aureus  isolates  were  classified  in  high,  mo-
derate and weak biofilm producers, based on OD540 re-
sults. One of them was a high biofilm producer (OD540 
1,24;  lower  quartile  value  OD540  1,05;  higher  quartile 
value OD540 1,32), other 10 were moderate biofilm pro-
ducers  (median  value  OD540  0,42;  lower  quartile  value 
OD540 0,33; higher quartile value OD540 0,53) while the 
remaining  9  isolates  produced  weak  biofilms  (median 
value OD540 0,21; lower quartile value OD540 0,17; higher 
quartile value OD540 0,25) (figure 1, panel A).

During  IMI,  bacterial  clusters  may  develop  within 
the udder and biofilm structures, may facilitate bacterial 
adherence  and  colonization  of  the  epithelium.  In  gene-
ral all isolates could establish biofilms in 24 h. Adhesion 
is a crucial early step for mammary gland infection but 
biofilm  also  may  enable  recurrent  infections  protecting 
bacterial cells from host defenses and the effects of anti-
biotics (Cucarella et al 2004). 

AUTOAggREgATION

The isolates showed a relative variable rate of autoag-
gregation values as can be seen in figure 1, Panel B. Iso-

318

late 20090305 showed the highest aggregation rate with a 
relatively small variance, similarly to strain ATCC 25923. 
Mann-whitney test showed that the autoaggregation ra-
tes of the 20 isolates could be grouped in at least 6 di-
fferent classes (group1: 20090305; group 2: 20080607, 
20090109,  20080849,  20090108,  20080611;  group  3: 
20090317;  group  4:  20090410;  group  5:  20080619, 
20090409,  20080903,  20090307,  20080919;  group  6: 
20090333, 20090323, 20080941, 20090431, 20090322, 
20090436,  20090403).  During  the  first  stages  of  infec-
tion  S.  aureus  produces  hydrophobic  surface  proteins, 
particularly receptors for host components that allow the 
adherence to the mammary epithelium and milk fat glo-
bules and thus it disseminates in the gland also promoting 
intercellular aggregation (Kerro Dego et al 2002). Autoa-
ggregation was seen in all isolates and also in different 
levels confirming bacterial adhesive capacity. however, 
no correlation could be established between bacterial au-
toaggregation and biofilm production.

ANTIBIOTIC SUSCEPTIBILITy PATTERNS
  

Only resistance against penicillin was observed, de-
tected in 4 S. aureus isolates (20 % excluding ATCC re-
ference strains used as controls). All isolates were sus-
ceptible to the other agents or agent combinations; none 
of the isolates showed resistance to more than one anti-
microbial agent.

These findings were similar to those reported by Ru-
bin et al (2011). Although the number of isolates could 
be considered as limited, our data indicate that bacterial 
antibiotic resistance could be low in the area, probably 
due to appropriate therapeutic managements.

It can be concluded that all the isolates considered in 
this study expressed virulence factors that potentially en-
hance S. aureus ability to colonize and persist in the mam-
mary gland and even on inert surfaces. The increase in the 
knowledge  of  S.  aureus  involved  in  subclinical  mastitis 
may be useful to design effective measures to avoid the 
chronicity of infection and losses of productive animals.
