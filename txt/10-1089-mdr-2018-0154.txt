The aims of this study were (i) to evaluate whether routine in-feed antimicrobial use in pigs or not resulted in
differences in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) E. coli at different pig producing stages, and (ii) to determine
whether resistant strains were presented in pig meat postslaughter. A total of 300 commensal E. coli isolates
were obtained and examined for antibiograms, AMR genes, plasmid replicons, and molecular types. The
isolates were from two farms either using (A) or not using in-feed antimicrobials (NA), sampled four times
during the production cycle and once postslaughter. E. coli resistant to aminoglycosides containing aadA1,
aadA2, and aadB and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing (ESBLP) E. coli containing blaCTX-M-1
were signiﬁcantly increased in the nursery and growing periods in farm A compared to farm NA. IncI1-Ig and
IncHI2 were common in the nursery period and were shown to transfer blaCTX-M genes by conjugation. ST10
was the most common type only found in live pigs. ST604, ST877, ST1209, and ST2798 ESBLP were found
only in live pigs, whereas ST72, ST302, and ST402 ESBLP were found in pig meat.

Introduction

T he ongoing increase in antimicrobial

resistance
(AMR) in enteric bacteria in production animals and
their potential transmission to humans represent a major
threat to public health.1 Commensal enteric bacteria such
as Escherichia coli (E. coli), which reside for prolonged
periods in the intestinal tract, potentially represent an im-
portant reservoir of AMR in the food chain, and moreover
they make good representative markers for investigating
dynamic changes in AMR genes.2 Even though the source
of AMR has not always been identiﬁed using molecular
epidemiological analysis or DNA-based data, bacteria from
livestock are believed to be a major source of AMR in the
environment, and resistant bacteria and resistance genes
may be acquired by the human gut microbiome.3

Some contract pig-rearing farms in Thailand routinely use
antimicrobials under veterinary prescription as feed addi-
tives for prophylaxis against bacterial infections and/or as
growth promoters. This use is problematic as it is increasingly
understood that imprudent application of antimicrobials dur-
ing the production cycle may increase the occurrence of
AMR bacteria on farms, especially during the immediate
postweaning ‘‘nursery’’ period.4 To date, most studies have
only involved cross-sectional observations taken at speciﬁc
periods of production, with the studied farms having a lack of
availability of historical data about antimicrobial use.5 A
more holistic understanding should result from longitudinal
surveillance at different points through the production cycle
to meat at slaughter, especially if exposure or lack of expo-
sure to antimicrobials can be recorded. Such studies should
indicate the likelihood of transmission of AMR bacterial from

animals on the farm to the product, and hence to the
consumer.5

The aims of this study were (i) to look for alterations in
AMR and characteristics of commensal E. coli isolated from
cohorts of pigs sampled at different phases during the pro-
duction cycle on farms, which either were routinely using or
not using in-feed antimicrobials, and (ii) to look for simi-
larities between E. coli contaminating pig meat and those
recovered from the same pigs on the two farms.

Materials and Methods

Farms

The study was undertaken at two multisite industrial pig
farms from Nakhon Pathom and Chainart Provinces, re-
spectively, both of which were run following the Thai
standard livestock farm criteria under the guidance of the
Department of Livestock Development. These were desig-
nated farm A (using antibiotics) and farm NA (not using
antibiotics). In farm A in Nakhon Pathom, a combination
of tiamulin and amoxicillin at 100 ppm and 250 ppm, re-
spectively, were routinely mixed into the feed during the
postweaning nursery and growing periods. In farm NA
located in Chainart, antimicrobials had not been used as a
feed additive for over 10 years. Enroﬂoxacin injections
were used in the case of symptomatic bacterial infections
in the preweaning period; however; all such treated pigs
were excluded from this study. Both farms had over 1,000
sows, had no pig replacement from outside sources, used
an all-in all-out production system, and had consistent man-
agement for at least 2 years in terms of antimicrobial use and
sanitary and biosecurity measures taken. The farms were well
managed and kept good records of production and antimi-
crobial use. On farm A, antimicrobial use was withdrawn at
least 30 days before the pigs were slaughtered.

Animal selection and timing of sampling

For each farm, one healthy pig from each of ten different
litters was selected for use in the experiment (a total 10 pigs
per group). Each pig was ear tagged and sampled at ﬁve
periods up to and including postslaughter: the neonatal pe-
riod (at 5 days of age); the postweaning nursery period (at 8
weeks of age); the growing period (at 14 weeks of age); the
ﬁnishing period (at 24 weeks of age, just before transport to
the abattoir); and following slaughter at the abattoir. None
of the pigs showed signs of ill health as judged by weekly
routine clinical inspection by veterinarians and the farmer’s
daily observations, nor did they receive therapeutic antimi-
crobials during the production cycle. The pigs from the two
farms were killed at two different abattoirs.

staff, half carcasses were suspended on hooks before being
moved for subsequent retail sale. A sterile scalpel blade
was used to excise at least 25 g of meat from the biceps
femoris muscle from a cross-section of the previously
opened thigh area of each hanging half-carcass. All sam-
ples were delivered to the laboratory at 4°C within
24 hours. The rectal swabs were suspended in 0.85% so-
dium chloride solution (NSS) and directly spread on Eosin
Methylene Blue (EMB) (Oxoid) agar.6 For rectal feces, at
-4 and the solutions
least 5 g was diluted 10-fold to 10
plated to EMB agar. One gram of each meat sample was
placed in a sterile plastic bag with 9 mL of sterile normal
saline and blended in a stomacher (Interscience Malaysia)
for 3 minutes. After vigorously shaking, 100 mL of the
suspension was spread on EMB agar.7 All plates were in-
cubated overnight at 37°C. For each sampling time for
each animal, three representative colonies from the highest
dilution plate were selected for further characterization.
Colonies presenting a metallic sheen on EMB plates were
selected and conﬁrmed as E. coli by their IMViC bio-
chemical reactions, comprising an indole test.8

Antibiogram and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase
phenotype conﬁrmation

The basic procedures followed have been described previ-
ously.9 The minimal inhibitory concentration of antimicrobials
for E. coli were determined using the AST-GN 38 test kit in the
Vitek2 compact automated susceptibility level detection ap-
paratus (BioMe´rieux, France). The 18 antimicrobials or com-
bination of antimicrobials used were as follows: amikacin (AK:
2–64 mg/mL), amoxicillin (AMX: 2–32 mg/mL), amoxicillin/
clavulanic acid (AMC: 2/1-32/16 mg/mL), ampicillin (AMP:
2–32 mg/mL), cefalexin (CEX: 4–64 mg/mL), cefpirome (CPR:
2–16 mg/mL), cefpodoxime (CPD: 0.25–8 mg/mL), ceftiofur
(XNL: 1–8 mg/mL), chloramphenicol (C: 2–64 mg/mL), en-
roﬂoxacin (ENR: 0.125–4 mg/mL), gentamicin (GEN: 2–
64 mg/mL),
imipenem (IMP: 1–16 mg/mL), marboﬂoxacin
(MBRL: 0.5–4 mg/mL), nitrofurantoin (NIT: 16–512 mg/mL),
piperacillin (PIP: 4–128 mg/mL), tetracycline (TET: 1–16 mg/
mL), tobramycin (TOB: 4–16 mg/mL), and trimethoprim/sulfa-
methoxazole (SXT: 1/19-16/304 mg/mL). E. coli ATCC 25922
was used as the control strain. The interpretation of the suscep-
tibility levels for AMP, CPD, CPR, XNL, GEN, ENR, MBR, and
TET was performed following the Clinical Laboratory Standards
(CLSI) for antimicrobial disks and testing for bacteria isolated
from animals (VET2-0S3),10 and interpretation for AMX, PIP,
AMC, CEX, IMP, AK, TOB, NIT, and SXT was followed ac-
cording to the CLSI standards for antimicrobial susceptibility
testing (M100-S25).11

Sample collection and bacterial identiﬁcation

The sampling protocol was approved by the Chula-
longkorn University Animal Care and Use Committee
(permit number 58/2558). For the pigs in the neonatal and
nursery periods, rectal swabs were taken directly and kept in
Clary-Blair transport medium. For pigs in the growing and
ﬁnishing periods, at least 25 g of rectal feces were collected
into sterile plastic containers. For the pigs at the abattoir,
meat (‘‘pork’’) was sampled and placed into sterile con-
tainers. Following routine abattoir processing by abattoir

Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotypic
screening and conﬁrmatory test

Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing (ESBLP)
E. coli were identiﬁed using the Vitek2 machine (BioMe´rieux,
France)12 and the results were conﬁrmed by the combination
disk test following CLSI standards recommendations.11 The
blaCTX-M genes comprising variants blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-2,
blaCTX-M-8, blaCTX-M-9, and blaCTX-M-25/26 were detected by
multiplex PCR in all ESBLP strains.13 The identity of repre-
sentative PCR amplicons was conﬁrmed by DNA sequencing

and analyzed using Mega 7.0,14 with comparisons made to the
GenBank database.

To conﬁrm whether blaCTX-M genes were located on
transmissible plasmids, a conjugation assay was performed
using the broth mating technique, as previous described.15
The three representative selected donor clones, E. coli
PCU12-4 (positive for blaCTX-M-1 group with a single
IncI1-Ig replicon), E. coli PCU12-5 (positive for blaCTX-M-1
group with a single IncHI2 replicon), and PCU12-6 (positive
for blaCTX-M-9 group with a single IncHI2 replicon), were
selected. The recipient strain E. coli J53 was resistant to so-
dium azide (Azir) and susceptible to cefotaxime. The trans-
conjugants were selected on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar (Oxoid)
-1) and sodium azide
supplemented with cefotaxime (2 mg mL
-1) (Oxoid). Testing for antimicrobial suscepti-
(100 mg mL
bility, ESBL conﬁrmatory phenotype, PCR detection, and
DNA sequencing of blaCTX-M genes was performed on the
transconjugants, as previously described.15

Detection of genes encoding AMR

DNA was extracted from the bacteria using a Wizard

Ò

Genomic DNA Puriﬁcation Kit
(Promega, Germany).
Sixteen pairs of primers that were speciﬁc for resistance
genes in bacteria in the superfamily Enterobacteriaceae
were generated (First Base Laboratories, Malaysia), and
the PCR thermal cycling conditions used followed pre-
vious recommendations. The resistance genes analyzed
included blaTEM and blaPSE-1 for ampicillin, amoxicillin,
and piperacillin resistance, aadA1 and aadA2 for strepto-
mycin resistance, aadB for tobramycin and gentamicin
resistance, tet(A) and tet(B) for tetracycline resistance,
sul1, sul2, and sul3 for sulfonamide resistance, dfrA1,
dfrA10, and dfrA12 for trimethoprim resistance, and catA,
catB, and cmlA for chloramphenicol resistance.16 The
blaCTX-M-1 group, blaCTX-M-2 group, blaCTX-M-8 group,
blaCTX-M-9 group, and blaCTX-M-25,26 group were included
as these are the most prevalent ESBLP encoding genes.13
A representative positive PCR amplicon for each gene
was submitted for DNA sequencing and was analyzed by
MEGA 7.0.14

Plasmid Replicon Characterization

The Enterobacteriaceae plasmid replicons IncF (IncFIA,
IncFIB, IncFIC, and IncFrep), IncI1-Ig, IncN, IncP, IncW,
IncHI1, IncHI2, IncL/M, IncT, IncA/C, IncK, IncB/O, IncX,
and IncY were detected using ﬁve multiplex and three sim-
plex PCR tests. The primers, PCR conditions, and thermal
cycles were as previously described.17 Representative posi-
tive PCR amplicons for each replicon were submitted for
DNA sequencing and analyzed as described above.

Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis

Pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed
on the 300 E. coli isolates following the CDC standard
protocol.18 Brieﬂy, E. coli DNA in agar plugs was digested
with restriction enzyme XbaI (Sibenzyme, Russia). Gel
electrophoresis was undertaken in a 200 V ﬁeld at 120° for
18–19 hours, incorporating Salmonella serovar Braenderup
H9812 DNA as a standard. Dendrograms were generated

using the GeneTool program (Syngene, India) and analyzed
with the GeneDirectory program (Syngene, India).

Multilocus Sequence Typing

The sequence types (ST) of the 300 E. coli isolates were
obtained based on the allelic proﬁles of seven genes with
‘‘housekeeping’’ function.19 STs were obtained using high-
throughput multilocus sequence typing (HiMLST) (Boers
et al., 2012).20 The target genes were ampliﬁed by a two-step
PCR using a primer sequence for the target genes that in-
cluded a universal tail sequence primer and an isolate-speciﬁc
multiplex identiﬁer sequence primer with 454 sequencing-
speciﬁc nucleotides at the 5¢ end. The PCR products were
pooled, clonally ampliﬁed by emulsion PCR (emPCR)
(Roche, Switzerland), and sequenced using the GS junior
(Roche). Allele and sequence types (STs) were assigned by
the publicly accessible E. coli MLST database at http://
mlst.warwick.ac.uk/mlst/dbs/Ecoli.

Data Analysis

Within each farm, comparisons between the rates of the
categorical variables (resistance; replicon detection; and
resistance gene proﬁles) of the E. coli isolates were made
between successive sampling times (i.e., results from the 30
isolates from the neonatal period compared to the 30 from
the postweaning period and the 30 from the postweaning
period compared to the 30 from the grower period). Between-
farm comparisons were made for the 30 isolates at each
sampling time for each variable. Results were analyzed using
the chi-square test in SPSS version 17.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY).
Isolates that were resistant to at least three antimicrobial
groups were deﬁned as being multidrug resistant (MDR).
The molecular strain types (PFGE proﬁles and STs) were
individually reported by descriptive analysis. The Shannon
diversity index (H’) was performed to determine the ge-
netic diversity of the E. coli strains between farms and was
calculated according to the following formula:

s

H¢¼   +
i¼ 0

pilnpi

S was the number of unique genotype; and pi was the
number of isolates sharing the same PFGE proﬁles [i] over
the total number of isolates.21

Results

Phenotypic resistance characterizations
and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase
phenotype conﬁrmation

A total of 300 commensal E. coli isolates were analyzed
(3 per pig at each sampling period, 150 per farm). The
AMR proﬁles for the 300 isolates against 18 antimicrobials
and their ESBLP proﬁle are shown in Fig. 1. Resistance to
nearly all the antimicrobials was common. All or nearly all
isolates at all sampling periods (including in pork) from
pigs in both farms were resistant to the b-lactam group
antibiotics (ampicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin), and to
tetracycline. Statistically signiﬁcant differences in resistance
rates and ESBLP phenotype between sampling periods were

(gentamicin,

highest rates being in the nursery and grower periods. These
same resistances were also statistically signiﬁcantly higher
in the nursery and grower periods in the pigs from farm A
compared to those from farm NA. Isolates with MDR phe-
notypes were common in both farm A (73.3%) and farm NA
(64.7%). The most common AMR pattern, AMP-AMX-PIP-

TET, was detected at 18.0% and 14.7% for the isolates from
farms NA and A, respectively.

Genotypic resistance characterizations

E. coli isolates is depicted in Fig. 2. All, but four of the
resistance genes were found in some of the isolates. The

and tet(A)] was found in both the NA (18.7%) and the A
farm (14.0%). Most AMR genes occurred in less than half
the isolates at all sampling periods, except for blaTEM and
tet(A) that were found among nearly all E. coli from both
farms. Statistically signiﬁcant differences in rates at differ-
ent sampling times were only found in farm A, and only for
the blaCTX-M-1 group, aadA1, aadA2, and aadB, where rates
were highest in the nursery and growing periods. Statistically
signiﬁcant differences in rates between farms were only
found for these same four genes, and only in the nursery and
grower periods, where rates were higher in farm A.

Replicon type detection and conjugation experiment

The prevalence of 18 plasmid replicon types detected in
the E. coli isolates is presented in Fig. 3. Replicons IncA/C,

IncB/O, IncFIIA, IncK, IncL/M, IncP, IncT, and IncX were
not detected. The IncFIB and IncFrep replicons were the
only ones commonly found in both farms. All the other
replicon types were found at a low to moderate preva-
lence in both farms. Statistically signiﬁcant differences
between sampling times were only found on farm A, and
these were for IncHI-2 and IncI1-Ig, which were increased
in the isolates from the nursery and grower periods com-
pared to other periods. These two replicons also were statis-
tically signiﬁcantly more frequently found in isolates from
farm A than in isolates from farm NA in both the nursery and
grower periods.

In the conjugation assay, E. coli PCU12-4 (positive for
blaCTX-M-1 group with a single IncI1-Ig replicon) transferred

Molecular genotypic characterizations

The 300 isolates had diverse molecular types: those from
farm A belonged to 25 STs and 43 PFGE types, while those
from farm NA belonged to 24 STs and 55 PFGE types. A
total of 41 STs were detected, and only nine were shared by

isolates from the two farms. No PFGE types were shared
between the two farms. Strain diversity (as assessed by
comparing PFGE types using the Shannon diversity index)
was higher on farm NA (H’ = 3.38) than on farm A
(H’ = 3.31). PFGE typing was more discriminatory than
MLST for identiﬁcation of individual strains, but both
methods gave broadly similar results in terms of depicting
relationships between isolates (Fig. 4). In the case of three
pigs, one or two isolates recovered from pork shared the
same molecular types and resistance proﬁles with those
recovered from the feces of the corresponding live animal at
earlier periods: this occurred in one pig on farm NA (ST44)

MDR IN COMMENSAL E. COLI: TEMPORAL CHANGES IN COHORTS OF PIGS

and two on farm A (ST638 and ST117) (Fig. 5 and Supple-
mentary Table S1; Supplementary Data are available online
at www.liebertpub.com/mdr). These shared strains did not
show the ESBLP trait or aminoglycoside resistance. Sharing
of strains with exactly the same characteristics between live
pigs and pork was not found for the other 17 pigs.

For the 100 sampling activities, there were only 11 instances
where the STs of the three isolates taken from the same pig
were the same (Supplementary Table S1). Eight of these 11
instances were in pigs from farm NA and three from farm A.
Nine of the incidences involved ST10, with the other two being
ST638 and ST597. In 40 cases, two of the three isolates had the
same ST (19 on farm NA and 21 on farm A), and in the other 49
cases, three different isolates were recovered.

Figure 6 presents a synopsis of the relationships of E. coli
isolates at each production period and in pork, based on their
STs. Although ST10 was not found in pork, it was the most
common type found in live animals from both farms (57/150
from farm NA and 40/150 from farm A). The difference
in rates for ST10 between the two farms was signiﬁcant
( p < 0.05). In nearly every case, the isolates from pork be-
longed to different STs from those in the live pigs: as pre-
viously mentioned, exceptions were ST638 in farm NA, and
ST44 and ST117 in farm A. Of the 12 STs that included
isolates recovered from pork, six had isolates with ESBLP
characteristics (ST302, ST402, ST604, ST877, ST1209, and
ST2798). These isolates were only found in pork, and four
of the STs were only isolated from the NA farm. ST597 did
not show ESBLP characteristics, but it was of interest be-
cause although it was not found in live pigs, it was common
in pork derived from pigs from both farms. STs containing
isolates with ESBLP characteristics did occur in pigs on
farm NA, but such strains were more common and some-
times also associated with aminoglycoside resistance in pigs
on farm A.

Discussion

Even though it is understood that commensal bacteria in
animals may act as a reservoir of AMR, to date, evidence
verifying a direct link between these organisms in livestock
and their occurrence in meat products is limited.22 This
study sought further evidence by undertaking longitudinal
monitoring of AMR in commensal E. coli isolated from
cohorts of pigs sampled at different stages of the pig pro-
duction cycle, and comparing these to isolates from meat
taken from the same animals after slaughter. Meat rather
than feces was sampled postslaughter, as this is the product
to which consumers are exposed. The design of the study
was not able to account for any potential postslaughter
cross-contamination of carcasses by E. coli strains during
their handling and processing before sampling occurred.

The study examined susceptibility to large numbers of
different antimicrobials, including consideration of ESBLP
and aminoglycoside resistance because of the high signiﬁ-
cance of these traits for human bacterial infections. In this
study, as in a previous study,9 aminoglycoside resistance
rates and the presence of aminoglycoside resistance genes
(aadA1, aadA2, and aadB) signiﬁcantly increased, but only
in the nursery and grower phases, and only on farm A.
Hence the routine use of unrelated antimicrobials increased
resistance to these critically important antimicrobials in

growing animals.9,23 The reason(s) for this remain unclear,
but may be due to some form of co-selection. Although
AMR was common, and resistance to b-lactam group an-
tibiotics and tetracycline were again found in most isolates,
the resistance rates in isolates from fattening pigs for ce-
falexin, cefpirome, cefpodoxime, ceftiofur, chloramphen-
icol, enroﬂoxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, marboﬂoxacin,
nitrofurantoin,
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole,
and ESBLP E. coli were lower than in a previous study in
Thailand.9 This difference was presumably due to farm-
speciﬁc factors, as the laboratory methods used in the two
studies were the same.

tobramycin,

To add another dimension to this study, two farms were
followed, with one routinely using in-feed antimicrobials
and the other not doing this. Previously we have shown
that this routine in-feed antimicrobial use increases AMR
rates in commensal E. coli in fattening pigs in Thailand,9
and hence we hypothesized that pork from farms using in-
feed antimicrobials might be more heavily contaminated
with AMR commensal bacteria following slaughter com-
pared to farms not using antimicrobials. Nevertheless, in this
study, no signiﬁcant differences were found in AMR rates in
isolates from pork from the two farms. Routine antimicro-
bial use on farm A only signiﬁcantly increased resistance
rates to aminoglycosides and the presence of ESBLP E. coli,
and only in the nursery and grower periods.

In general, farm management and geographical origin
have been shown to inﬂuence genetic diversity and the
presence of AMR genes found in porcine E. coli isolates.24
In previous studies, a high clonal diversity of E. coli in pigs
has been shown to occur both at the individual and pen
levels,25 although individual strains may come to dominate.
For example, in one recent cross-sectional study in a Danish
pig farm not using antimicrobials, E. coli strains of ST10
and ST58 commonly were recovered throughout the grow-
ing period.20 In this study, three colonies from a high di-
-4) of each sample were selected for analysis to
lution (10
enhance the recruitment of a variety of E. coli strains.9,26
Using this sampling method, ST10 was the major type found
in live animals in both farms, but it was not found in pork
meat. ST10 E. coli also has been reported in humans,
chickens, and other animals.27,28 In contrast to ST10, ST597
was the most common type found in pork from both
farms, but it was not identiﬁed in live animals. It also was
not ESBLP or resistant to aminoglycosides. ST597 could
have been a cross-contaminant from the environment of
the abattoir, from equipment, or from other carcasses, al-
though the pigs from the two farms were killed in different
abattoirs and so no single external source existed. ST597
has been reported as an enteric foodborne pathogen in
humans,29 so identifying the route for its appearance in
pig meat in abattoirs is important. Further studies into
transmission of E. coli with AMR characteristics in the
food chain are required: in particular, Hazard Analysis and
Critical Control Points should be applied during farm to
abattoir transportation, and through the standard slaugh-
tering process, meat trimming, and packaging. The dom-
inant E. coli types found in meat may have attributes that
could help to explain why they are present rather than
other types found in live animals.

As anticipated, molecular tracing and evaluation of strain
relationships using MLST and PFGE gave similar results.30

MDR IN COMMENSAL E. COLI: TEMPORAL CHANGES IN COHORTS OF PIGS

1065

Most E. coli types in pork were not detected in live pigs,
except for STs 44, 117, 155, and 638 that included non-
ESBPL E. coli and were negative for blaCTX-M genes. As
with previous cross-sectional surveys, no relationship was
found between molecular types that contained genes en-
coding ESBLP and aminoglycoside resistance on the farm
and their presence in the abattoir.31

Resistance to amino-penicillins (ampicillin and amoxi-
cillin) and urevido-penicillin (piperacillin) conferred by
the blaTEM gene and tetracycline resistance conferred by
the tet(A) gene were the most common forms of AMR in
both farms at all observation periods, and was consistent
with results of previous cross-sectional studies in Southeast
Asia.32 The persistence of blaTEM and tet(A) genes in
E. coli may not be caused by direct selective pressure, but
may imply an abundance of blaTEM and tet(A) genes in
Enterobacteriaceae bacteria in the region.33 Despite
cephalosporins and aminoglycosides not being used on
the farms, ESBLP E. coli containing blaCTX-M-1 group and
aminoglycoside-resistant E. coli containing aadA1, aadA2,
and aadB were common in the nursery period in farm
A. This conﬁrmed the ﬁndings of our previous study9 and
might be explained by a co-harboring of multiresistance
genes, including cfr and blaCTX-M genes, on a conjugative
plasmid.34

Replicons IncFrep and IncFIB are reported as the most
common types found in E. coli from humans and animals, and
this was seen in both groups in this study. These plasmids,
which encode factors involved in iron uptake, toxin produc-
tion, enzymes, and a variety of resistance genes, for example,
blaCTX-M, are widely spread in Enterobacteriaceae.35 In farm
A, the high frequency of IncI1-Ig, IncHI2, in E. coli in the
nursery period was strongly correlated with the detection of
ESBLP and the blaCTX-M-1 group gene. In previous studies,
IncHI2 was found to carry not only the blaCTX-M -2 gene but
also a variety of genes encoding sulfonamide, aminoglyco-
tetracycline, and streptomycin resistance.36 IncI1-Ig
side,
carrying blaCTX-M-1 is also the most common plasmid found in
E. coli from livestock.37 Thus, the nursery and grower pigs
from farm A could act as an important reservoir of AMR on
the farm, and possibly have an impact on public health by
amplifying resistance genes that eventually make their way to
other zoonotic pathogens or to the environment.

In conclusion, commensal E. coli with AMR traits (espe-
cially resistance to b-lactam group antibiotics and tetracy-
cline) were common in pigs from both farms at all sampling
periods. E. coli that were aminoglycoside resistant and ESBLP
were commonly found in the nursery and grower periods, and
were signiﬁcantly more common in the farm that routinely
used unrelated classes of antibiotics. Molecular typing showed
that on both farms, strains from pigs and pork were different
in terms of their clonal types and characteristics. This suggests
that on-farm resistance, which is encouraged by antimicrobial
usage, does not necessarily reﬂect the attributes of E. coli
found in meat at the abattoir. Further work is required to
identify potential sources of resistant E. coli found in pig meat
following slaughter.
