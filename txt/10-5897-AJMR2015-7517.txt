The study was carried out with the aim to isolate Staphylococcus aureus from camel and goat raw milk 
and  determine  their  antimicrobial  susceptibility  pattern.  204  raw  milk  samples  were  collected  from 
randomly  selected  lactating  camels  (n=62)  and  lactating  goats  (n=142)  in  live-stock  producing 
pastoralists’ areas of Somali region for isolation and identification of S. aureus. Antibiotic susceptibility 
tests were performed  on  all  S.  aureus  isolates  to  16  antibiotics by  Kirby-Bauer  disk  diffusion  method. 
Twenty  three  (11.27%  of  the  total)  S.  aureus  strains  were  isolated.  Four  (6.45%)  strains  were  isolated 
from camel raw milk samples and 19 (13.34%) from  goat raw milk samples. S. aureus isolates showed 
resistance  to  Nalidixic  acid,  Polymixin  B,  and  Penicillin  G.  S.  aureus  isolates  were  sensitive  to 
vancomycin,  ciprofloxacin,  cefoxitin,  cephalotin,  gentamycin,  Doxycycline,  kanamycin,  trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, norfloxacin, and erythromycin. Multi drug resistance was detected 
in 69.2% of the isolates.  The present study has demonstrated the existence of alarmingly high level of 
multiple antimicrobial resistances of S. aureus among camel and goat milks.  
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Staphylococcus aureus is a ubiquitous human and animal 
pathogen  and  a  common  cause  of  invasive  and  life 
threatening  infections.  Human  illness  through  S.  aureus 
range  from  minor  skin  infection  such  as  pimples,  boils, 
cellulites, 
impetigo,  and 
abscesses 
threatening  disease  such  as 
pneumonia,  meningitis,  endocarditis,  and  septicaemia 
(Daka  et  al.,  2012;  Thaker  et  al.,  2013;  Mekuria  et  al., 
2013).  S.  aureus  is  also  a  major  causative  pathogen  of

clinical  and  subclinical  mastitis  in  animals  (Adwan  et  al., 
2005;  Mekuria  et  al.,  2013).  On  top  of  it,  it  is  also  an 
important  food  borne  pathogen.  Milk  has  been  reported 
as  a  common  food  which  is  a  source  of  staphylococcal 
infections  and  a  cause  of  staphylococcal  poisoning 
(Lowy, 1998; Le loir et al., 2003). About 50% strain of  S. 
aureus  are  able  to  produce  enterotoxins  associated  with 
food poisoning (Payne and Wood, 1974).  

The  natural  ecological  niches  of  S.  aureus  are  the

nasal  cavity  and  the  skin  of  warm-blooded  animals.  The 
skin,  mucosa  membranes,  teats  and  udders  of  milking 
animals  are 
this 
contaminant.  S.  aureus  is  frequently  isolated  from  raw 
milk manually draw from individual animals, bulk raw milk 
and  naturally  from  milk  of  dairy  cattle  suffering  from 
mastitis. (Medveďová and Valík, 2012).

the  most 

important 

Contamination  of  milk  and  milk  products  with 
pathogenic bacteria is mainly due to processing, handling 
and  unhygienic  environment.  The  occurrence  of  these 
pathogenic  bacteria  in  milk  and milk  products  can  cause 
severe  health  hazards  to  people  as  they  are  highly 
susceptible  to  variety  of  microorganism  because  of  high 
nutritive  value  and  toxic  nature  caused  by,  or  thought  to 
be caused by the complex chemical composition (Thaker 
et al., 2013). 

The indiscriminate use of antibiotics for the treatment 
of  animal  and  human  diseases  as  well  as  preservatives 
for  milk  has  led  to  the  development  of  multiple  antibiotic 
resistances  thereby  rendering  the  antibiotic  treatment 
ineffective.  S.  aureus  has  been  reported  to  frequently 
show  multiple  antimicrobial  resistance  patterns  (Enright, 
2003). There is a limited number of studies on prevalence 
and antimicrobial resistance of  S. aureus originated from 
camel  and  goat  milk  in  the  pastoralist  areas  of  Ethiopia. 
Thus,  this  study  aimed  to  isolate  S.  aureus  from  milk  of 
healthy  lactating  camel  and  goat  in  Somali  region  of 
Ethiopia  and  found  out  its  prevalence  and  antimicrobial 
resistance pattern.  
 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Study design and area description 
 
A  cross-sectional  study  was  conducted  from  November  2013  to 
April  2014  in  Somali  region  which  is  located  in  Eastern  part  of 
Ethiopia. The  area was selected for its potential  production  of  milk 
by  pastoralist  and  semi-pastoralists.  Pastoralists/semi-  pastoralists 
were included using systematic random sampling methods to meet 
our total sample number requirement. The areas are geographically 
found  at  a  latitude  of  9°21’N  and  a  longitude  of  42°48’  E  and 
characterized  by  unreliable  and  erratic  rainfall  with  a  precipitation 
ranging from 300 to 600 mm per annum, high ambient temperature 
of  30°C,  sparsely  distributed  vegetation  dominated  by  Acacia 
species,  cactus  and  bushy  woodlands.  These  are  arid  and  semi-
arid lowlands lying at an elevation of 500 to 1500 m above sea level 
and are not suitable for crop production (Tafesse, 2001).  
 
 
Dairy pastoralists/semi-pastoralists’ household selection 
 
Zonal  and  woreda  agriculture  bureau  were  contacted  to  obtain  the 
important base-line data about the potential milk production of dairy 
pastoralists/semi-pastoralists  living  in  each  kebeles  (the  smallest 
administrative  divisions  in  each  region  of  Ethiopia)  and  get 
guidance  during  sample  collection.  Based  on  this  base-line  data, 
rural  Kebeles  with  milk  production  potentials  were  selected  using 
purposive  sampling.  Thirteen  kebeles  were  included  in  the  study 
from  four  woredas  (Larger  administrative  division  in  Ethiopia  and 
comprises  around  20-25  kebeles)  and,  pastoralist/semi-  pastoralist 
households who own local camel and goat  breeds from  each rural 
Kebeles  were selected. The local camel breeds were one  humped 

 
 
 
African camels (Bos indices) and the goat breeds were Short-eared 
Somali  and  Long-eared  Somali  Milk  samples  were  collected  from 
pastoralist/semi-  pastoralist  households  based  on  availability. 
Househods  which  have  one  lactating  camels  and/or  goats  were 
taken as milk sources.   
 
 
Study population and sampling techniques 
 
A  total  of  204  raw  milk  samples  were  collected  from  randomly 
selected lactating camels (n=62) and lactating goats (n=142) in live-
stock producing pastoralists’ areas of Somali region that were kept 
under  traditional  management  from  different  woredas  (Larger 
administrative  division  in  Ethiopia  and  comprises  around  20-25 
kebeles)  in  Somali,  eastern  Ethiopia.  The  total  number  of  samples 
were  determined  based  on  previously  reported  prevalence  of  S. 
aureus which were 4.2%  in camel milk of Jijiga town (Husein et al., 
2013)  and  12.8%  in  goats  milk  of  Adami  Tulu  areas  (Molla  et  al., 
2006) in Ethiopia, respectively.  

The study included major local camel and goat breeds of Somali 
region of Ethiopia for sources of raw milk. The lactaing camels and 
goats  were  included  from  the  selected  zones  and  woredas  of  the 
region based on randomly selected households.  
 
 
Sample collection and transportation methods  
 
From 
the  randomly  selected  dairy  pastoralist/semi-pastoralist’ 
households, milk samples were collected based on availability after 
gathering  information  about  the  local  breed  types  they  own.  Raw 
milk  was  directly  drawn  from  udder  of  lactating  camels  and  goats 
which  were  found  in  the  selected  pastoralist/semi-pastoralist’ 
households in each kebeles. A total of 204 raw milk samples were 
collected  using  sterile  plastic  test  tubes.  For  collection  of  raw  milk 
samples, the udder was washed with antiseptic solution, wiped dry 
with clean cloth and then disinfected with 70% alcohol, the foremilk 
was  discarded  and  20-40  ml  of  pooled  milk  were  collected.  Milk 
samples  were  transported  in  an  ice  box  with  ice  to  Ethiopian 
Biodiversity  Institute,  Addis  Ababa,  Ethiopia  for  further  bacterial 
identification.  
 
 
Isolation and identification of S. aureus 
 
About  0.1  ml  of  milk  sample  was  streaked  on  Mannitol  Salt  Agar 
(MSA) (Hi-Media Laboratories, Mumbai, India) plate  and incubated 
at  37°C  for  24-48  h  for  the  isolation  of  S.  aureus.  Suspected 
colonies of S. aureus that were yellow in colour on each MSA plate 
were  further  purified  by  sub-culturing  onto  MSA  plates  and 
incubated  aerobically  at  37°C  for  18–24  h  (Daka  et  al.,  2012; 
Sharma et al., 2011).  

Bacterial 

identification  was  performed  by  gram  staining, 
microscopic examination of the  morphology and  biochemical tests. 
Gram-positive cocci that occurred in clusters under the microscope 
were  subjected  to  preliminary  biochemical  tests  (the  catalase  and 
oxidase tests). The identities of the isolates were confirmed  based 
on positive results for the DNase test, beta-haemolytic patterns on 
blood agar enriched with  5% sheep blood  and the coagulase slide 
and  coagulase  tube  test  for  S.  aureus  (Bergey’s  Manual  of 
Systematic Bacteriology, 2009; Daka et al., 2012). 
 
 
Antimicrobial susceptibility test 
 
Antibiotic  susceptibility  tests  were  performed  by  the  Kirby-Bauer 
disk diffusion method (CLSI, 2008) on all S. aureus isolates (n=23) 
using Mueller Hinton agar (supplied by Oxoid, UK). Fresh overnight 
cultures were prepared and used for antibiotic  sensitivity  tests.  An

aliquot (100 μL) from each isolate suspension was spread plated on 
Mueller  Hinton  agar  (supplied  by  Oxoid  Company).  Susceptibilities 
of the isolates to a panel of sixteen different antibiotic discs (6 μm in 
diameter,  Mast  group  LTD  MERSEY  SIDE,  UK)  were  determined. 
The 
their 
corresponding  concentration  were  used:  Penicillin  G  (10  units), 
Amoxicillin  (25  mcg),  Cephalothin  (30  mcg),  Cefoxitin  (30  mcg), 
Gentamicin (10 mcg), Kanamycin (30mcg), Nalidixic acid (30 mcg), 
Ciprofloxacin 
(10mcg),  Trimethoprim-

(15  mcg),  Vancomycin  (30  mcg),  Chloramphenicol  (30  mcg), 
Doxycycline  (30  mcg)  and  Tetracycline  (30  mcg).  Antibiotic  discs 
were  gently  pressed  onto  the  inoculated  Mueller  Hinton  agar  to 
ensure  intimate  contact  with  the  surface  and  the  plates  were 
incubated  aerobically  at  37°C  for  18h-24  h  (CLSI,  2008).  Inhibition 
zone  diameters  were  measured  and  value  obtained  from  Clinical 
and  Laboratory  Standards  Institute  (CLSI,  2008)  was  used  to 
interpret  the  results  obtained.  S.  aureus  isolates  were  then 
classified  as  resistant,  intermediate-resistant  or  susceptible  to  a 
particular antibiotic. Multiple drug resistant (MDR) phenotypes were 
recorded  for  isolates  showing  resistance  to  three  and  more 
antibiotics (CLSI, 2008; Rota et al., 1996). 
 
 
Data analysis 
 
Statistical analyses were carried out   using STATA version 11  and 
WHONETs version 5.6 statistical software packages after exporting 
the  raw  data  which  were  entered  into  excel  spread  sheet. 
Descriptive  statistics  such  as  percentages  and

resistant,  intermediate  and  susceptible.  In  addition,  the  proportion 
of  bacteria  resistant  to  at  least  one  of  the  sixteen  antibiotics  and 
resistant two or more were calculated. 
 
 
RESULTS 
 
Prevalence  of  S.  aureus  in  camel  and  goat  milk 
samples 
 
Of  the  total  204  examined  goat  and  camel  raw  milk 
samples,  23  (11.27%)  were  positive  for  S.  aureus.  Four 
(6.45%)  S.  aureus  were  isolated  from  the  62  camel  raw 
milk  samples,  and  19  (13.34%)  were  isolated  from  142 
goat raw milk samples (Table 1). The highest isolation of 
S.  aureus  was  from  goat  milk  (13.34%)  while  less  was 
from camel milk (6.45%) (P value=0.15).

DISCUSSION  
 
The observed  prevalence of S. aureus in camel and goat 
milk found in the present study is in line with the findings 
of  Husein  et  al.  (2013)  who  found  4.2%  isolation  rate  in 
camel  milk  in  and  around  Jijiga  town  and  Molla  et  al. 
(2006)  who isolated 12.8% from goat milk in Adami Tulu 
town in Ethiopia. Similarly, it was closely comparable with 
the  findings  of  Ebrahim  et  al.  (2013)  who  reported  3.4 
and 7.5% prevalence of S. aureus in camel and goat milk 
in  Iran,  respectively.  However,  the  present  findings  are 
lower than that of Abdurahman et al. (2006) who reported 
12.7% in Errer valley of eastern Ethiopia and Abera et al. 
(2010)  who  showed  a  26.3%  prevalence  of  S.  aureus 
from  mastitis  milk  of  camel  at  Jijiga,  eastern  Ethiopia. 
This  high  isolation  rate  of  S.aureus  from  camel  milk  is 
due to the fact that the collected milk unlike ours is from 
clinicaly  diseased  camel  suffering  from  mastitis  which  is 
mainly caused by S.aureus.

some of the drugs is also reported in Tofaily et al. (2011). 
Tofaily  et  al.  (2011)  showed  in  their  findings  that  S.

of  S.  aureus  to  some  antibiotics  is  much  different.  For 
instance,  Mekuria  et  al.  (2013)  reporetd 
the 
susceptibility  rate  of  S.  aureus  isolates  to  Erythromycin 
was 21.6%. Alamin et al. (2013) reported a susceptibility 
rate  of  33.3%  to  Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole  and 
Tofaily  et  al.  (2011)  cited  a  sensitivity  percentage  of 
16.6% to Erythromycin. S. aureus isolated in the present 
study  found  to  be  highly  susceptible  to  these  antibiotics. 
This  might  be  that  these  antibiotics  are  not  frequently 
used in the study area in veterinary services and perhaps 
in human medicine.  

The  high  percent  of  antimicrobial  resitance    exihibited  
to  Nalidixic  acid,    Polymixin  B  ,  and  Penicillin  G.    in  this 
study  is  in  line  with  the  findings  of  Tariku  et  al.  (2011) 
who  reported  87.2%  resistance  to  penicillin  in  Ethiopia, 
64.3%  of  resistance to penicillin G  (Daka et al.,  2012)  in 
Hawassa  area  of  Ethiopia  and  80%  resistance 
to 
penicillin  which  is  reported  in  Sweden  by  Landin  (2006). 
This  is  in  contrast  to  findings  observed  by  Adesiyun 
(1994)  who  reported  23%  of  resistance  to  pencillin  G  in 
West India and Alian et al. (2012) who reported 17.4% of 
resistance to pencillin G in Iran.  

The  probable  explanation  to  the  presence  of  high 
antibiotic  resistant  S.  aureus  to  nalidixic  acid,  polymixin 
B,  penicillin  and  tetracyclin  is  the  indescriminate  and 
repeated  use  of  these  antibiotics  in  animal  and  human 
health  facilities  of  the  present  study  area.  Penicillin  and 
tetracycline  are  the  most  commonly  used  antimicrobials 
in  the  treatment  of  infections  in  the  livestock  sector  in 
Ethiopia. Moreover, tetracycline is widely used as growth 
factors  in  Veterinary  Medicine  for  livestock  rearing  in 
addition to the treatment of bacterial infections.  

The  present  study  has  demonstrated  the  existence  of 
alarmingly high level of multiple antimicrobial resistances 
of  S.  aureus.  69.2%  of  the  isolated  S.  aureus  developed 
MDR.  This  result  is  in  line  with  Daka  et  al.  (2012)  who 
reported  62.8%  multidrug  resistance  rate  of  S.  aureus 
isolates  from  cow’s  milk  in  Hawassa  town  which  is 
located in southern  Ethiopia.  Chao  et  al.  (2007)  similarly 
reported  a  higher  multidrug  resistance  rate  (79%)  of  S. 
aureus.  This  is  also  comparable  with findings  of  Sharma 
et  al.  (2011)  who  reported  70%  MDR  S. aureus  from

raw  milk  of  dairy  cattle  in India.  A  special  attention  must 
be  given  to  the  high  prevalence  of  multidrug  resistant 
S.aureus indicated in the present study area among dairy 
goat  and  camel  which  has  great  risk  for  consumers  and 
individuals  who  have  contact  with  animals.  If  these 
strains  do  cause  diseases,  treatment  with  the  antibiotics 
that  they  are resistant to might not be useful. It is also a 
concern  if  those  isolates  get  transmitted  to  humans  and 
cause disease (Zunita et al., 2008). 
 
 
Conclusion  
 
The prevalence of S. aureus in camel and milk is found to 
be  6.45  and 13.34%  in  Somali  region  of  Ethipia.  A  large 
proportion of the isolates were resistant to three or more 
antibiotics which showed the existence of MDR S. aureus 
in the husbandry. Resistance to Vancomycin is shown in 
some  S.  aureus  isolates.  Thus,  it  needs  an  attention 
since  Vancomycin  is  one  of  the  last  choice  in  the 
treatment  of  S.  aureus  infections.  The  antimicrobial 
resistance  tests  carried  out  in  this  study  indicated  the 
high  resistance  of  Staphylococcus  species  to  nalidistic 
acid, polymixin B and penicillin G. The high level of MDR 
S. aureus needs further investigation based on molecular 
methods  to  study  its  impacts  and  dynamics  of  genetic 
antibiotic determinants.
