This study was conducted to detect extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and plasmidic AmpC beta-
lactamase (pAmpC-BL)-producing Escherichia coli isolates in industrial poultry samples were collected from
healthy chickens of the three farms. Samples were inoculated onto desoxycholate-lactose-agar plates supple-
mented with cefotaxime (2 mg/L). E. coli was identiﬁed by biochemical and molecular methods and antibiotic
susceptibility testing by the disk diffusion method. Genes encoding ESBLs and pAmpC-BL were detected by
PCR and sequencing. Phylogenetic groups were determined by triplex PCR. The molecular typing of strains was
done by pulsed ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) in those isolates show-
ing different PFGE patterns. Cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates were recovered in 48 of 137 fecal samples (35%),
and one isolate/sample was further studied. The following beta-lactamase genes were detected: blaCTX-M-1 (29
isolates, isolated in all three farms), blaCTX-M-15 (5 isolates, conﬁned in farm II), blaCTX-M-14 and blaCMY-2 (one iso-
late and 13 isolates, respectively, in farm III). The 48 cefotaxime-resistant isolates were distributed into
phylogroups: B1 (n = 21), A (n = 15) and D (n = 12). PFGE analysis revealed 19 unrelated patterns: 15 different
proﬁles among ESBL-positive strains and 4 among the CMY-2-positive isolates. The following sequence types-
associated phylogroups were detected: a) CTX-M-1-positive strains: lineages ST542-B1, ST212-B1, ST58-B1,
ST155-B1 and ST349-D; b) CTX-M-15-positive strain: lineage ST405-D; c) CTX-M-14-positive strain: lineage
ST1056-B1; d) CMY-2-positive strains: lineages ST117-D, ST2197-A, and ST155-B1. Healthy chickens constitute
an important reservoir of ESBL- and pAmpC-BL-producing E. coli isolates that potentially could be transmitted
to humans via the food chain or by direct contact.

1. Introduction

A steady increase in the rates of Escherichia coli resistant to third gen-
eration cephalosporins (3rd GC) is reported worldwide (Carattoli,
2008). This resistance can be associated with the production of ex-
tended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and/or plasmidic AmpC
beta-lactamases (pAmpC-BL) (Paterson and Bonomo, 2005). Such resis-
tant bacteria can cause severe community or hospital acquired infec-
tions. Although person-to-person spread is recognized as the main
way of spread of ESBL/pAmpC-BL containing E. coli both in hospitals
and the community, the primary reservoirs of such organisms are con-
tentious. Also, these microorganisms have been isolated from food-
producing animals and derived foods in many countries, which has

raised questions about the possible role of animal and food related res-
ervoirs on this phenomenon (Mellata, 2013).The predominant ESBL
families are CTX-M, TEM, and SHV (Paterson and Bonomo, 2005). The
most common ESBL gene is blaCTX-M-1 and blaCTX-M-15 in animals and
in humans, respectively, and the most common pAmpC-BL gene is
blaCMY-2 (Ben Slama et al., 2011; Ben Sallem et al., 2012). ESBL/
pAmpC-BL transmission is mainly driven by mobile genetic elements,
some of which are homologous in isolates from both food-producing
animals and humans (Liébana et al., 2013). Epidemic plasmids belong-
ing to the Inc groups F, A/C, N, HI2, I1 and K, carrying particular ESBL
or pAmpC-BL encoding genes have been detected among farms and
companion animals, food products and humans (Carattoli, 2008; Ben
Sallem et al., 2014). In Tunisia, only a few studies report the fecal car-
riage of E. coli resistant to 3rd GC in food-producing animals (Ben
Sallem et al., 2012; Grami et al., 2013; Kilani et al., 2015).

The present study was conducted to detect ESBL/pAmpC-BL positive
E. coli isolates from healthy poultry in three Tunisian farms and to

characterize the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and the molecular
typing of recovered isolates.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sampling and bacterial identiﬁcation

During 2013, 137 fecal samples were collected from healthy
chickens at three industrial laying hen farms in North of Tunisia (39
samples in farm I, 62 samples in farm II and 36 samples in farm III).
Each farm contained 2 to 4 buildings containing from 5000 to 10,000
birds (only one building was studied in the present work). Chickens
were kept in caged (box) systems; each box contained 4 to 6 ones.
The approximate area of each building is 1000 m2, with 10 roof-
mounted fans. Water and food intakes were assured by 4 drip-type
drinker and ad libitum feeding, respectively, and feces discharge real-
ized at the end of breeding cycles.

Moreover, personal entrance in these farms was very well controlled
to avoid contamination. Random boxes were selected and 1 to 3 sam-
ples of fresh feces were taken by sterile cotton swabs and transported
at 4 °C to the laboratory to be analyzed in the same day. In order to con-
sider each box as a single sample, the 3 cotton swabs were combined
and directly rubbed onto desoxycholate lactose agar plates (Biokar
Diagnostics, France) supplemented with cefotaxime (CTX, 2 mg/L) to
isolate cefotaxime-resistant isolates. After incubation at 37 °C for 24 h,
one colony per sample showing E. coli morphology were recovered
and identiﬁed by classical biochemical methods, API 20E system
(BioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), and by species-speciﬁc PCR
(ampliﬁcation of uidA gene) (Jouini et al., 2007).

2.2. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and ESBL identiﬁcation

cefoxitin,

ceftazidime,

trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing to 17 antibiotics (amoxicillin,
amoxicillin-clavulanic acid,
cefotaxime,
imipenem, aztreonam, gentamicin, amikacin, tobramycin, nalidixic
acid, ciproﬂoxacin,
tetracycline,
minocyclin, tigycycline and chloramphenicol) was determined by the
agar disk diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar plates (Bio-Rad,
France) according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
guidelines (CLSI, 2013). One cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolate per
sample was selected and screened for ESBL-phenotype by double-disk
synergy test (DDST) with cefotaxime, ceftazidime and amoxicillin-
clavulanic acid disks (CLSI, 2013). Those cefotaxime-resistant E. coli
isolates showing a negative-ESBL-phenotype but showing resistance
to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefoxitin, were included in the
pAmpC-BL-phenotype.

2.3. Molecular typing of cefotaxime-resistant E. coli strains

In order to determine the clonal relationship among cefotaxime-
resistant E. coli isolates, agarose plugs containing genomic DNA of the
isolates were digested with XbaI enzyme (BioLabs, New England).
XbaI-digested DNA fragments were separated by pulsed-ﬁeld gel elec-
trophoresis (PFGE) on a 1% agarose gel in 0.5× Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer
using a CHEF-DRIII device (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France). PFGE
conditions were as follows: 6 V/cm for 23 h with pulse times ranging
from 1 to 30 s at 14 °C (Tenover et al., 1995; Sáenz et al., 2004). A lambda
ladder was used as a standard size marker (BioLabs, New England).
Patterns were visually compared and analyzed according to previously
reported criteria (Tenover et al., 1995; Sáenz et al., 2004).

The isolates were assigned to the phylogenetic groups A, B1, B2 or D
using a PCR strategy with speciﬁc primers for chuA, yjaA and TspE4.C2
determinants (Clermont et al., 2000).

One cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolate from each of the nineteen dif-
ferent PFGE proﬁles was characterized by Multilocus Sequence Typing
(MLST), by PCR ampliﬁcation of the standard seven housekeeping loci

(Tartof et al., 2005). All the amplicons were sequenced and compared
with the sequences deposited in the MLST database (http://mlst.
warwick.ac.uk/), to know the speciﬁc allele combination and the se-
quence type (ST).

2.4. Virulence genotyping of cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates

All isolates were screened for 18 virulence factors (VFs) found in
extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) using PCR (Johnson and
Stell, 2000). A virulence score was calculated as the sum of all VFs for
which the isolates tested positive. ExPEC status of the isolates was
analyzed based on the operational deﬁnition of Johnson et al., that is,
presence of ≥2 of the following 5 virulence genes, papA and/or papC,
sfa/focDE, afa/draBC, iutA, and kpsM II (Johnson et al., 2003).

2.5. Molecular analysis of antibiotic resistance genes and the genetic
environment of blaCTX-M

DNA extraction was performed for all samples by boiling. The
presence of beta-lactamase genes [blaCTX-M-consensus, blaCTX-M-1, 2, 8, 9,
25-groups, blaOXA, blaSHV, blaTEM, blaCMY, blaACC, blaMOX, blaFOX,
blaDHA, blaLAT, blaACT and blaMIR] was detected by PCR and sequencing
(Pérez-Pérez and Hanson, 2002; Saladin et al., 2002). The genetic envi-
ronment of blaCTX-M genes was characterized and determined by PCR
and sequencing (Eckert et al., 2006).

2.6. Detection of resistance genes to non-beta-lactam antimicrobial agents

The presence of genes associated with resistance to tetracycline
[tet(A) and tet(B)], sulphonamides [sul1 and sul3], streptomycin
[aadA1 and aadA2], chloramphenicol [cmlA], and quinolones [qnrA,
qnrB, qnrS, qepA and aac(6′)-Ib-cr] was determined by PCR and sequenc-
ing (Sáenz et al., 2004).

2.7. Detection and characterization of integrons

The presence of int1 and int2 genes (encoding class 1 and class 2
integrases, respectively) was examined by PCR for representative iso-
lates (one isolate per PFGE pattern). The variable regions of class 1
and class 2 integrons were characterized by PCR and sequencing in all
int1- or int2-positive isolates (Ben Slama et al., 2011).

2.8. Plasmid typing

Plasmids carried by selected isolates (one isolate per PFGE pattern)
were assigned to the incompatibility groups using PCR-based replicon
typing method (Carattoli et al., 2005a).

2.9. Statistical analysis

Virulence score was determined for each strain and calculated as the
sum of virulence genes detected, with papG alleles counting collectively
as a single determinant.

Statistical testing was done using SPSS (version 10.0) and Epi Info
(version 6.04) softwares. Comparisons of proportions were determined
using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Comparisons of virulence
scores were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal–
Wallis. Values P ≤ 0.05 were considered to be signiﬁcant.

3. Results

3.1. Prevalence of cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates and antibiotic
susceptibility

Cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates were recovered in 48 of the 137
fecal samples (35%) of the three poultry industrial farms analyzed [9/39

(23.07%), 13/62 (20.9%), and 26/36 (72.2%) in farm I, II and III,
respectively]. Among the 48 cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates, 35 ex-
hibited a positive ESBL-screening test (72.9%). The remaining isolates
(n = 13), all recovered in farm III, showed an pAmpC-BL phenotype
characterized by resistance to cefoxitin and amoxicillin-clavulanic
acid, in addition to reduced susceptibility to broad-spectrum cephalo-
sporins and a negative ESBL-screening test. Consequently, 25.5% of
tested samples carried ESBL positive E. coli isolates and 9.4% were car-
riers of E. coli isolates with pAmpC-BL phenotype.

The majority of the 35 ESBL-positive E. coli isolates were co-resistant
to non-beta-lactam antibiotics (Table 1), being resistant
to:
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (46%), nalidixic acid (80%), ciproﬂoxa-
cin (43%), gentamicin and amikacin (3%), tetracycline (94%), and
minocyclin (71.4%). In addition, the 13 CMY-2-producing E. coli isolates
seemed to be more resistant than ESBL-producing isolates. They
were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (100%), nalidixic
acid (100%), ciproﬂoxacin (100%), tetracycline (100%), minocyclin

(100%) gentamicin (54%), and amikacin (15%). All cefotaxime-
resistant E. coli isolates showed susceptibility to carbapenems and
tigecycline (Table 1).

3.2. Genes encoding beta-lactamases, clonal relationship and virulence
genotyping in cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates

The presence of genes encoding beta-lactamases was studied in the
35 ESBL-positive E. coli isolates and the following beta-lactamases were
identiﬁed: CTX-M-1 (29 isolates, recovered in farms I (9 isolates), II (8
isolates) and III (12 isolates)), CTX-M-15 (5 isolates, conﬁned in farm
II) and CTX-M-14 (one isolate, in farm III). The blaTEM-1 gene was con-
comitantly present in 8 isolates. All isolates with pAmpC-BL phenotype
harbored the blaCMY-2 gene (13 isolates, conﬁned in farm III) (Table 1).
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that isolates belonged to the follow-
ing groups: B1 (n = 21), A (n = 15) and D (n = 12). ESBL-producing
isolates were signiﬁcantly associated with phylogenetic group B1

(P = 0.016), and the majority of CMY-producing isolates (9/13 isolates)
were ascribed to phylogenetic group A (Table 1).

PFGE analysis demonstrated 19 unrelated patterns among the 48
cefotaxime-resistant isolates: 15 different proﬁles among ESBL-
positive isolates and 4 among the CMY-2-positive isolates (Fig. 1).
More than one cefotaxime-resistant isolate (2–9 isolates) were detected
in 10 PFGE proﬁles, and the remaining 9 PFGE proﬁles were detected in
unique isolates. All CTX-M-15-producing strains belonged to the same
PFGE pattern and 9 of the 13 CMY-2-producing ones were clonally re-
lated. However, the 29 CTX-M-1-producing strains were assessed onto
13 different PFGE proﬁles (Table 1).

The presence of virulence genes was analyzed in the whole collec-
tion of 48 cefotaxime-resistant strains. Of the 18 VFs sought, ﬁmH viru-
lence gene was detected in 47 strains (except in C6901), iroN in 30 and
iutA in 18 strains. Overall, virulence scores were in the range of 1 to 8
(median, 5). E. coli strain C6945, typed as ST155-B1 (CMY-2), contained
8 VFs (ﬁmH, fyuA, iutA, iroN, iha, traT, ompT and usp). Nevertheless,
papGI, papGIII or afa/draBC virulence genes were not detected in any
strain (Table 1). Compared with ESBL-producing isolates, CMY-2-
producing isolates were found to be enriched for usp virulence gene
(P = 4 × 10−8), while no statistical difference was observed in the inci-
dence of other virulence genes. Nonetheless, no statistical difference
was observed between the mean virulence score of the ESBL- and
CMY-2-producing isolates. High virulence scores were signiﬁcantly as-
sociated with phylogenetic group D (P = 0.004). ExPEC status analysis
of the isolates showed that 3/35 (8.57%) ESBL-producing isolates were
qualiﬁed as ExPEC and were typed as ST93-A (CTX-M-1).

3.3. Characterization of PFGE-unrelated E. coli isolates producers of ESBL
and pAmpC-BL

One isolate corresponding to each of the 19 unrelated PFGE patterns
were selected for complete characterization and results are included in
Table 2.

Sequence types and associated phylogenetic groups detected among
these 19 strains were the following ones: a) CTX-M-1-positive strains:
lineages ST542-B1, ST212-B1, ST58-B1, ST4968-B1, ST1431-B1,
ST1196-B1, ST93-A, ST350-D, ST155-B1 and ST349-D; b) CTX-M-15-
positive strain: lineage ST405-D; c) CTX-M-14-positive strain: lineage
ST1056-B1; d) CMY-2-positive strains: lineages ST117-D, ST2197-A,
and ST155-B1. Strains showing P1 and P4 PFGE patterns could not be as-
sociated with any ST registered, to date, in the Warwick MLST Database.
In both cases, point mutations in different alleles were identiﬁed by
Sanger sequencing.

The genetic environment of the blaCTX-M gene was analyzed in the
strains showing this gene. The ISEcp1 insertion sequence was found up-
stream of blaCTX-M-1 (in 11 of 13 strains), blaCTX-M-15 (in strain C6917)
and blaCTX-M-14 genes (in strain C6926). In strain C6924, harboring
blaCTX-M-1, ISEcp1 was truncated with IS5. The orf477 sequence was de-
tected downstream of blaCTX-M-1 (in 12 of the 13 selected strains) and
blaCTX-M-15 (in strain C6917). IS903 sequence was found downstream
of blaCTX-M-14 in strain C6926 (Table 2).

Over the 19 selected strains, 14 harbored the int1 gene (associated to
int2 in three strains) and analysis of their variable region (VR) detected
the following gene cassette arrangements: aadA2 (one strain), dfrA14

plus aadA1 (one strain), and dfrA1 plus aadA1 (three strains). Four
strains harbored the int2 gene and the dfrA12 plus sat2 plus aadA1
gene cassettes were detected in all of them. In four strains, neither
int1 nor int2 gene was detected (Table 2).

Different genes were detected among the antibiotic resistant strains
[antibiotic (number of resistant strains)/gene (number of strains)]: tet-
racycline (19)/tetA(16)/tetB(4); and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
(13)/sul1 (3)/sul3 (2).

The IncI1, IncF, IncFIB, IncFIA, IncK, IncY, IncP and IncN replicons
were detected among tested E. coli strains, and different replicon combi-
nations were identiﬁed. The IncI1, IncF and IncFIB replicons were de-
tected combined in eight blaCTX-M-1-positive E. coli strains (Table 2).

4. Discussion

Antibiotics had been widely used in healthy animals for growth pro-
motion, practice now banned in the European Union and in other coun-
tries, but still active in others (Millet and Maertens, 2011). In Tunisia,
this restriction on growth promoters exists; although it is not enforced.
Under the pressure of antibiotic selectivity, drug-resistant bacteria
emerge and disseminate in healthy animals and can spread to humans
through consumption of contaminated food, from direct contact with
animals, or by environmental spread (Ewers et al., 2007; Horton et al.,
2011; Mellata, 2013). The genes coding for antimicrobial resistance
can be transferred from microbes carried by animals to microbes that
cause disease in humans (Johnson et al., 2012).

In the present study, in all three industrial farms, animals (chickens)
were colonized by cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates. The rate of fecal
carriage of these multidrug resistant bacteria in healthy chickens varied
from one farm to another (20.9% to 72.2%), which is consistent with
global data (Girlich et al., 2007; Reich et al., 2013), including those of
Tunisia (42% and 45.5%) (Ben Sallem et al., 2012; Mnif et al., 2012).
These results conﬁrm that chicken farms constitute a reservoir of
cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates, which might reﬂect a high antibiotic
pressure for selection of resistant bacteria in this ecosystem (Mellata,
2013).

CTX-M-1 was detected in all three farms; however CTX-M-15 and
CMY-2 were conﬁned to farms II and III respectively. In fact, CTX-M-1
enzyme is the most dominant ESBL type in E. coli isolates among intes-
tinal microbiota of healthy chickens worldwide (Meunier et al., 2006;
Girlich et al., 2007; Ben Sallem et al., 2012; Grami et al., 2013). However,
CTX-M-15 enzyme, pandemic in human clinical E. coli, appears to be an
emerging variant β-lactamase in fecal carriage of healthy animals (Ben

Slama et al., 2011; Mnif et al., 2012). CTX-M-14-producing E. coli, previ-
ously isolated in meat chicken in Tunisia (Jouini et al., 2007), was found
in one specimen in farm III. As previously reported, CMY-2 is the most
dominant pAmpC-BL in E. coli isolates from healthy animals, humans,
food samples and companion animals (Brinas et al., 2003; Carattoli
et al., 2005b; Ben Slama et al., 2010; Ben Sallem et al., 2012). The high
rate occurrence of E. coli harboring blaCTX-M-1 and blaCMY-2 in poultry
and their food products can contribute to the transmission of these
genes to humans.

In this study, different clones of E. coli carried the gene encoding
CTX-M-1 in the three tested farms. The CTX-M-15-producing E. coli
strains were clonally related and typed as ST405-D, being this ESBL-
positive clone previously detected in human infections (Ben Slama
et al., 2011; Matsumura, et al., 2012). At least three E. coli clones carried
the gene blaCMY-2, highlighting the detection of lineages ST117 and
ST155, previously detected in isolates of animal, human or vegetable or-
igins (Ben Sallem et al., 2014; Ben Said et al., 2015). It seems that clones
and genetic variants of ESBLs and pAmpC-BL are not restricted to a
unique ecosystem but a continuous ﬂow is occurring. Thus the dissem-
ination of these enzymes is related with the dissemination of plasmids
containing their genes. As previously showed, we found that both
IncI1 and IncF were the most prevalent plasmid replicon types detected
in cefotaxime-resistant E. coli strains (Carattoli, 2009; Ben Sallem et al.,
2014).

The ISEcp1 detected upstream of most of blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-15 and
blaCTX-M-14 genes in this study seems to be important for mobilization
of ESBL gene (Eckert et al., 2006). The IS5 disruption of ISEcp1 in one
blaCTX-M-1 harboring strain of our study, was previously detected in
blaCTX-M-1 strains of healthy pets also in Tunisia (Sallem et al., 2013);
this disruption might affect the mobilization and/or expression of the
gene, fact that should be corroborated in the future. Class 1 integrons
were predominant in our study in ESBL-positive isolates in relation to
class 2 integrons, what is in agreement to previous studies (Machado
et al., 2005; Souﬁ et al., 2009; Ben Slama et al., 2010; Cergole-Novella
et al., 2010; Souﬁ et al., 2011).

Concerning the distribution of pathogenic E. coli strains according to
phylogroups, in human it is known that pathogenic strains producing
extra-intestinal infections (ExPEC) belong more frequently to the B2
group in relation to other groups. They can be implicated in meningitis,
abscess, peritonitis, septicemia and urinary tract infections in humans,
among others (Nandanwar et al., 2014); while, groups A and B1 E. coli
strains are more frequently commensal strains (Ewers et al., 2007). In
the present study, the majority of cefotaxime-resistant E. coli strains

74

E. Maamar et al. / International Journal of Food Microbiology 231 (2016) 69–75

were found to belong to B1 phylogenetic group (n = 21), followed by A
and D (15 and 12, respectively). These results are in agreement with
those reported in the literature (Mnif et al., 2012; Huber et al., 2013).
Extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) are part of the intestinal mi-
crobiota of a fraction of the healthy population and normally asymp-
tomatically colonize the gut. Once they get access to niches outside of
the gut they are however able to efﬁciently colonize these niches and
cause diseases in humans or in many animals (Kohler and Dobrindt,
2011). In fact, several investigations have shown that ExPEC strains
may encode widespread VFs that are closely related to colonization, per-
sistence, and pathogenesis of bacteria (Johnson and Stell, 2000). The
most important of these factors include adhesins or ﬁmbriae, toxins
and iron-acquisition systems (Johnson and Stell, 2000). These, may
have been acquired by plasmids or pathogenicity-associated islands
(Johnson et al., 2001). In our strain collection, the median VF score is
5. ﬁmH, encoding for ﬁmH adhesin known for its important role in intes-
tinal colonization and initiation of infection, was the most frequently
virulence gene detected.

5. Conclusion

Chickens have become an important reservoir of cefotaxime-
resistant E. coli isolates which contain virulence determinants, in
Tunisia. Our study reports the dissemination of various E. coli clones
producing CTX-M-1, several CMY-2-E. coli clones as well as one E. coli-
ST405 clone with CTX-M-15 at industrial poultry farms in Tunisia. De-
tailed molecular comparison of plasmids and genomes of isolates from
various sources will help to better deﬁne the transmission dynamics
of ESBLs between humans and animals.
