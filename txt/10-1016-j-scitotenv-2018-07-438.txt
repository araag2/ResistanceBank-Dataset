The objective of this study was to verify the presence of antimicrobial resistant strains of Escherichia coli in pig
farms and to use it as a biomarker to evaluate phenotypic and genotypic proﬁles of antimicrobial susceptibility,
as well as the presence of Extended Spectrum Beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and ﬂuoroquinolone resistance genes.
Several samples (n = 306) collected from swine farms (n = 100) of Southern Brazil were used for E. coli isola-
tion: 103 of swine feces, 105 of water, and 98 of soil. E. coli isolates were submitted to the disk-diffusion test to
verify their antimicrobial susceptibility, to disk-approximation test to detect ESBL-producers, and to PCR analysis
to search for ESBLs genes (blaCTY-M2, blaSHV-1, blaTEM-1, blaCTX-M2, blaOXA-1, blaPSE-1) and quinolone resis-
tance genes (qnrA, qnrB and qnrS). The percentage of E. coli isolates found in feces, water and soil samples was
66.02%, 30.48% and 35.71%, respectively. The highest percentages of resistance were obtained for sulfamethoxa-
zole associated with trimethoprim (63.70%), colistin (45.19%) and enroﬂoxacin (39.26%). Regarding the levels of
multidrug resistance, 37.04% of the isolates were resistant to three or more classes of antimicrobials. The most
common proﬁle (16%) of multirresistance was GEM-SUT-ENO-COL. The index of multiple resistance to antimi-
crobials (IRMA) was above 0.2 in 78% of the multiresistant isolates. Out of 135 E. coli isolates, 7.41% was ESBL-
producers, of which 50% showed the blaCMY-M2 gene, 40% the blaTEM-1 and 70% the qnrS gene. Of non-ESBL-
producing strains resistant to enroﬂoxacin, 13.04% were positives for qnrS gene. These results demonstrated

1. Introduction

Brazil is one of the largest animal protein producer, with 3.3 million tons
of pork meat produced in 2017, where 600 thousand tons were exported to
more than 70 different countries (ABPA, 2017). In 2016, the state of Santa
Catarina (Southern Brazil) accounted for 38% of all exported Brazilian
pork meat (EPAGRI, 2017). However, high concentration of animal produc-
tion can lead to environmental problems, such as soil saturation caused by
animal waste and also soil and water contamination by pathogenic micro-
organisms (Silva et al., 2015).

Contaminated water and soil may spread pathogenic microorgan-
isms, and the bacterium Escherichia coli can be used as a biomarker of
environmental contamination. E. coli is a commensal microorganism
of the gastrointestinal tract of humans and many animals that can
cause diseases and the spread antimicrobial resistance genes (Caldorin
et al., 2013). It is indicated as a biomarker due to its abundance and di-
rect contact with the gastrointestinal tract of animals, being susceptible
to all environmental conditions of this organ, such as feed, additives and
performance enhancers (Rochelle-Newall et al., 2015).

Recently, bacteria isolated from many environments have been
identiﬁed as important reservoirs of resistance genes that can be
transferred to other pathogens through mobile elements, such as
genes that encode the production of Extended Spectrum Beta-
lactamases (ESBLs), confering resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics
(Jiang et al., 2011). These same mobile elements confer resistance
to quinolones and ﬂuoroquinolones through genes encoding the
production of proteins capable of protecting the bacterium from
drug action (Yeh et al., 2017).

Cephalosporins and ﬂuoroquinolones are widely used in human and
animal medicine and are classiﬁed as “critically important antimicro-
bials” by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2014). Although Santa
Catarina State has been a state with a large pork meat production for
many decades, little is known regarding its antimicrobial resistance sta-
tus. In this sense, the objective of this work was to isolate E. coli from
feces, water and soil of farms with swine production in order to evaluate
its phenotypic proﬁle of antimicrobial susceptibility, as well as to corre-
late the presence of ESBLs and qnr genes in beta-lactam and ﬂuoroquin-
olone resistant strains of E. coli.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sampling and E. coli isolation

A total of 306 samples were collected from March 2016 to May 2017
(103 samples of swine feces, 105 of water and 98 samples of soil) from
rural farms (n = 100) with pork production in many cities (n = 20) of
Santa Catarina state, mainly in the municipalities of Seara and
Xavantina, where the highest volume of meat production takes place
(EPAGRI, 2017). The identiﬁcation and origin of the samples are de-
scribed in Tables 3, 4 and 5. The samples were conditioned in sterilized
bottles and transported under refrigeration to the laboratory. E.coli iso-
lation was performed according to the technique of Quinn et al. (2005)
with some adaptations, where the samples were incubated in lactosate
broth (1:10) for 24 h at 36 ± 1 °C. They were then seeded in petri dishes
containing Eosin Methylene Blue Agar (EMB) and MacConkey Agar and
incubated at 36 ± 1 °C for 24 h. The colonies with green metallic char-
acteristics on EMB Agar and pink on MacConkey Agar were submitted
to biochemical tests (Urea Base Agar, TSI Agar, Sim Medium Agar and
Agar Simmons Citrate) and subsequently incubated at 36 ± 1 °C for
24 h. After biochemical conﬁrmation of the colony as E. coli, it was incu-
bated in microtubes containing Tryptone Soya Agar medium at 36 ± 1
°C for 24 h and stored −20 °C after the addition of steril glycerol.

2.2. Antimicrobial susceptibility test

For the antimicrobial susceptibility test, the methodology approved
by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, 2018) and the
National Agency for Sanitary Surveillance (ANVISA, 2003) was used,
which is included in the Normative Instruction M-2 A-8 Antimicrobial
Susceptibility by Disk Diffusion, where ﬁve classes of antimicrobials
(ATBs) with different mechanisms of action were tested, with the se-
lected antimicrobials commonly used in swine production in Brazil:
beta-lactams (amoxicillin associated with clavulanic acid 30 μg - AMC)
and third-generation cephalosporin (ceftiofur 30 μg - CTF),
ﬂuoroquinolones (enroﬂoxacin 5 μg - ENO), aminoglycosides (gentami-
cin 10 μg - GEM), sulfonamides (trimethoprim associated with sulfa-
methoxazole 25 μg - SUT) and polymyxins (colistin 10 μg - COL) by

the company DME® (Specialized Microbiological Diagnostics). After
24 h of incubation, the halo of bacterial growth inhibition was mea-
sured, and the bacterium was classiﬁed according to the tables de-
scribed by CLSI (2018) as resistant, intermediate or susceptible. A
sample of E. coli ATCCA® 25922 was used as control.

ceftriaxone (CRO) (30 μg) and cefepime (CPM) (30 μg), were subse-
quently incubated at 37 °C ± 1 for 24 h. A sample of E. coli ATCC®
25922 was used as control. After incubation, strains positives for ESBLs
were veriﬁed by the presence of a “ghost zone”, represented by the en-
largement of the zone of inhibition between the disks used.

2.3. Multiple Drug Resistance (MDR) and Multiple Antimicrobial Resistance
Index (IRMA)

The most prevalent multidrug resistance (MDR) proﬁles were also
observed from disk-diffusion data, where it was possible to determine
the number of E. coli isolates that were considered multiresistant (con-
comitant resistance to three or more classes of antimicrobials) (Frye and
Cray, 2007). The Multiple Antimicrobial Resistance Index (IRMA) was
calculated according to the methodology described by Krumperman
(1983), which shows the relationship between the number of resistant
antimicrobials and the total number of classes tested. IRMA can be used
to identify the risk of transmission to humans, where strains with values
above 0.2 are considered of high risk.

2.4. Disk-approach test for detection of ESBLs

The disk-approximation test was performed to detect ESBL-
producers according to Jarlier et al. (1988). E. coli was inoculated into
a tube containing 3 ml of lactose broth and incubated at 37 °C ± 1 for
8 h or until the turbidity level reached 0.5 on the McFarland scale.
Using a sterile swab moistened in the bacterial suspension, the sample
was inoculated smoothly in all directions of the plate containing
Muller-Hinton agar, and with the aid of a ﬂared and cooled clamp, the
disks containing each antimicrobial were placed between a distance of
25 mm. The disks used for this test were: clavulanic acid-amoxicillin
(AMC) (30 μg) in the center of the plate to visualize the synergism of
the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid with the other antimicro-
bials: azetreonam (ATM) (30 μg); ceftazidime (CAZ) (30 μg);

2.5. DNA extraction and ampliﬁcation by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
to search for genes related to the production of ESBLs and resistance to
ﬂuoroquinolones

For the detection of resistance genes related to beta-lactams, DNA
was extracted from E. coli ESBL-producers using the PureLink® Genomic
DNA for Puriﬁcation of Genomic DNA kit (Invitrogen, Life Technologies,
Carlsbad). PCR was performed for the following ESBLs genes: blaCMY-
M2, blaSHV-1, blaTEM-1, blaCTX-M2, blaOXA-1, blaPSE-1 and AmpC
using a BioRad brand T100TM Thermal Cycler® equipment. Reactions
were performed as recommended by Platinum® PCR SuperMix
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA). The primers used and
the conditions for ampliﬁcation of these genes were used according to
Chen et al. (2004) and conditions for ampliﬁcation of the AmpC gene
were performed according to Alcaine et al. (2010) (Table 1).

Due to the fact that ESBLs genes are usually in the same plasmid that
confers resistance to quinolones and the later be easily spread through-
out the environment, we searched for qnrA, qnrB and qnrS genes in
E. coli isolates resistant to enroﬂoxacin and ESBL-producers (Moumoni
et al., 2017). The primers used (Yue et al., 2008), as well as PCR condi-
tions are described in Table 2. These genes were selected due to the
great use of related antimicrobials (ﬂuoroquinolones and beta-
lactams) and the coexistence of these genes in the same plasmids, facil-
itating the dispersion of these genes among bacterial strains (Yue et al.,
2008).

As a positive control for the PCR reaction, a Salmonella Heidelberg
sample was used for ampliﬁcation of the invA gene previously detected,
where the ampliﬁcation conditions were obtained as described by Singh

3.1. Isolation of E. coli and the antimicrobial susceptibility test

Tables 3, 4, and 5 show the percentage of E. coli isolation, as well as
the proﬁle for antimicrobial resistance. Out of 306 samples studied,
44.12% (135/306) were positives for E. coli and 66.02% (68/103) were
from swine fecal samples, 30.48% (32/105) from water and 35.71%
(35/98) from soil. Overall, bacterial resistance was 82.96% (112/135) ac-
cording to the disk diffusion test, that is, the samples were resistant for
at least one of the studied antimicrobial. The highest overall percentages
of resistance was for fecal samples and to sulfamethoxazole associated
with trimethoprim (63.70% and 75%, respectively), colistin (45.19%

ciated with clavulanic acid - AMC) and third generation cephalosporin (ceftiofur - CTF);

and 42.65%, respectively) and enroﬂoxacin (39.26% and 54.41%, respec-
tively) (Fig. 1). For water and soil, the highest resistance indices were
for sulfamethoxazole associated with trimethoprim (40.63% and
62.86%, respectively) and colistin (31.25% and 60%, respectively), with
increased resistance to beta-lactams (21.88% and 37.14%, respectively).
Regarding the levels of multidrug resistance (MDR), it was possible
to observe that 37.04% (50/135) of the isolates were resistant to at
least three different classes of antimicrobials, where strains from feces
represented 62% (31/50) of all multiresistant isolates (Table 6).

3.2. Multiple Drug Resistance (MDR) proﬁles and Multiple Antimicrobial
Resistance Index (IRMA)

Table 6 shows the most prevalent multidrug resistance (MDR) pro-
ﬁles and the Multiple Antimicrobial Resistance Index (IRMA) obtained
through the disk-diffusion test of E. coli strains. The main
multirresistance proﬁles observed were A (GEM-SUT-ENO-COL) with
16% (8/50) of the multiresistant samples, followed by B [CTF-GEM-
SUT-ENO-COL] and C [SUT-ENO-COL] with 12% (6/50). Regarding the
IRMA results, 78% (39/50) of the multirresistant strains showed values
above 0.2, indicating a high potential risk of transmission to humans. In-
dividually, the B (six isolates) and I (two isolates) proﬁles showed IRMA
values of 1, that is, the isolates were resistant to all classes of antimicro-
bials tested.

3.3. Disk-approximation test for ESBLs

Out of 135 isolates submitted to the disk-approximation test, it was

possible to visualize the “phantom zone” in 7.41% (10/135).

3.4. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to investigate genes related to ESBLs
and resistance to ﬂuoroquinolones

The gene blaCMY-M2 was detected in 50% (5/10) of the ESBLs-
producers, followed by the blaTEM-1 genes in 40% (4/10) and AmpC
with 20% (2/10) (Table 7). However, the genes blaSHV-1, blaCTX-M2,
blaOXA-1 and blaPSE-1 were not detected. For the genes that confer re-
sistance to the ﬂuoroquinolones, PCR results showed a prevalence of
70% (7/10) for the qnrS gene. The qnrA and qnrB genes were not de-
tected in the E. coli strains ESBL-producers.

Table 8 shows the PCR results for the enroﬂoxacin-resistant strains
(n = 46 since 53 isolates were resistant to enroﬂoxacin and seven
were ESBL-producers, which were previously analyzed), where 13.04%
of the strains had the presence of qnrS gene (6/46). The qnrB and qnrA
genes were not detected.

4. Discussion

Approximately one third of the water samples were contaminated
with fecal material. da Malheiros et al. (2009) evaluated the bacteriolog-
ical contamination of groundwater in the Western region of Santa
Catarina and found that 75.94% of them were unﬁt for human consump-
tion, demonstrating a high microbiological load in the water sources in
this region. Several factors can contribute to the contamination of water
in rural properties, such as the inefﬁcient management of human and
animal waste, as well as the lack of hygiene or protection against ro-
dents and wild animals (Satake et al., 2012). The presence of E. coli in
fecal samples of swine can easily be explained by the fact that this bac-
terium is part of the intestinal microbiota, responsible for maintaining
the intestinal balance, with the exception of some pathogenic strains
that are classiﬁed according to some traits of virulence (Romer et al.,
2012). Some studies demonstrated the ability of this bacterium to sur-
vive and grow for long periods of time in the environment (Bradford
et al., 2013).

Another important point to note is the percentage of E. coli
multiresistant since a third of the isolates showed resistance to at least
three classes of antimicrobials and 78% of the multiresistant strains
showed IRMA values above 0.2, representing a high risk of transmission
to humans (Krumperman, 1983). Resistance to antimicrobial sulfa-
methoxazole associated with trimethoprim has been widely reported
in cases of diarrhea in piglets caused by E. coli and also in commensal
E. coli isolated from swine and the environment (Costa, 2006). The anti-
microbial colistin has been widely used as a growth promoter, however
recent detections of mcr-1 genes conferring bacterial resistance to this

antibiotic mediated by plasmids lead the Brazilian government to ban
its use (Brazil, 2016).

Xiong et al. (2015) reported high concentrations of enroﬂoxacin, cip-
roﬂoxacin and norﬂoxacin in environments fertilized with animal
waste, which could explain the signiﬁcant antimicrobial resistance
rates found in our study. In enterobacteria, one of the major mechanism
of resistance to quinolones and ﬂuoroquinolones is mediated by plas-
mids that carry genes responsible for the synthesis of proteins that in
turn block topoisomerases (Hu et al., 2017). These same plasmids may
contain other resistance genes, such as those conferring resistance to
beta-lactams and cephalosporins, through the production of ESBLs
(Jacoby et al., 2014). In this context, more than 400 ESBLs have been de-
scribed so far and are usually derived from point mutations of the TEM,
SHV and CTX-M groups, with 183, 134 and 103 variants, respectively
(Barguigua et al., 2011). Abraham (2015) evaluated the resistance of
114 E. coli isolated from pigs and detected 14.91% resistance to amoxicil-
lin associated with clavulanic acid and 2.63% to ceftiofur, which were
lower than those found in this study (25% and 11.76% for ceftiofur and
amoxicillin associated with clavulanic acid, respectively). These data
suggest that selective pressure in animal production may explain
these ﬁndings, especially in regions with high rates of pig breeding
(Gebreyes et al., 2017). Signiﬁcant resistance indices to beta-lactam
were detected in E. coli strains isolated from water and soil samples. In
a study by Jiang et al. (2011), in which the highest prevalence and dis-
tribution of multirresistant E. coli isolates in China were reported,
27.3% of the water isolates and 18.8% from soil showed resistance to
amoxicillin, demonstrating the widespread of resistant bacteria
(Egervarn et al., 2017). The lack of Brazilian data related to this matter
indicates the need for further studies for better evaluation of the envi-
ronmental contamination by resistant microorganisms in order to en-
hance surveillance and to establish preventive measures.

The most prevalent ESBL gene described in previous studies from
several sources was CTX-M and its variants CTX-M-2, CTX-M-8 and
CTX-M-9 (da Silva and Lincopan, 2012). However, in our study the
blaCMY-M2 gene was the most prevalent, being positive for 50% of the
phenotypically ESBL-producing isolates, followed by the blaTEM-1
gene, demonstrating the emergence of other ESBLs encoding genes, in-
creasing concerns about the emergence and spread of these genetic mo-
bile elements. The usual use of
third and fourth generation
cephalosporins as therapy or food additives in pig production may se-
lect high bacterial resistance (Gao et al., 2015), and a matter of growing
concern is that genes encoding ESBLs are frequently found (Xu et al.,
2015), a fact related to the results obtained in our study, where out of

ten E. coli ESBLS-producers, seven showed the qnrS gene, and 142 iso-
lates showed, concomitantly, the genes blaTEM, blaCMY-M2, AmpC
and qnrS. The identiﬁcation of ESBL genes encoding ESBLs in E. coli iso-
lates of environmental origin enhances the need for adequate rural san-
itation, considering the possibility of contamination of water and food
with resistant microorganisms. Brazil and the Western region of Santa
Catarina are important producers of pork meat, and the possibility to
disseminate these genes to other pathogenic microorganisms through
mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, integrons and transposons
by bacterial conjugation can considerably affect animal production, as
well as human health.

5. Conclusion

It is possible to conclude that most of the strains of E. coli isolated
were resistant to antimicrobials and carry genes of resistance to quino-
lones, ﬂuoroquinolones and ESBLs and because of that they are resistant
to these antimicrobials. Considering that Brazil is a large meat producer
with unknown status regarding the antimicrobial resistance our ﬁnd-
ings are important for public health. In addition, the dissemination of re-
sistance genes between strains of the same species or even between
different species may cause serious diseases in humans and animals
with difﬁcult treatment, highlighting the need of rational use of antimi-
crobials and adequate animal waste treatment.
