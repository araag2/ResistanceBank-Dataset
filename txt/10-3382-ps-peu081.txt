ABSTRACT The
the
characteristics of Salmonella spp. from broiler chicken
farms in Brazil. In total, 82 Salmonella spp. strains
were characterized by serotyping, determining suscep-
tibility to antimicrobials, and using pulsed-field gel elec-
trophoresis (PFGE). Fifteen Salmonella serotypes were
identified, among which Minnesota (40.24%), Infantis
(14.63%), Heidelberg (7.31%), Senftenberg (6.09%),
and Mbandaka (6.09%) were the most
frequent.
Salmonella Minnesota occurred mostly in the state of
Mato Grosso do Sul and in one of the broiler companies
surveyed. Approximately 60% of the strains were re-
sistant to at least one of the antimicrobials tested.
From these isolates, 17.07% were resistant to only
one antimicrobial (tetracycline or streptomycin), and

9.75% were resistant to 3 or more antimicrobial
classes. Thirteen resistance profiles were character-
ized, the most frequent of which were the resis-
tance to tetracycline (15.85%); to the combination of
trimethroprim with sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline
(10.97%); and to the combination of streptomycin
and tetracycline (9.75%). Multiple correspondence
analysis revealed that susceptibility or resistance of
the analyzed strains and also particular Salmonella
serotypes were associated with broiler-producing com-
panies where the samples were collected. Strains
presented high intraserotype genetic variability, as
shown by the 64 PFGE profiles, suggesting the exis-
tence of several contamination sources in the surveyed
farms.

INTRODUCTION

Salmonellosis is one of the most complex zoonoses af-
fecting worldwide public health. The over 2,600 known
serotypes are found in a wide variety of animal reser-
voirs, and they are especially resilient, surviving in di-
verse environments, which explains their high potential
to spread (EFSA, 2014). Broiler flocks are among the
main Salmonella reservoirs and are an important means
of transmission of the bacteria (Verge et al., 2005;
Foley et al., 2008; FAO-WHO, 2009; Tabo et al., 2013).
Therefore, the consumption of chicken is considered a
risk factor for Salmonella infections in humans (FAO-
WHO, 2009). Another important aspect surrounding
the transmission of pathogens by animal-source foods
is the likely dispersion of antimicrobial-resistant strains.
The use of antimicrobials in both human and veteri-
nary medicine promotes selective pressure, favoring the
emergence of resistant strains and narrowing the choice
of therapeutically efficacious drugs that are available

(Verge et al., 2005; Muhammad et al., 2010; Barrow
et al., 2012; Hur et al., 2012; Lai et al., 2014). The most
common problems linked with antimicrobial resistance
include morbidity, mortality, and the costs associated
with diseases (Muhammad et al., 2010).

Due to the existence of several potential contami-
nation sources, such as environment, transportation,
equipment,
litter, vectors, water and feed, the con-
trol of Salmonella on broiler farms is a difficult task
(Foley et al., 2008; FAO-WHO, 2009). In an attempt
to ensure flock health and the innocuousness of poul-
try products in Brazil, the Ministry of Agriculture,
Livestock and Food Supply (MAPA) has implemented
the Poultry Health National Plan (PNSA), which in-
cludes Salmonella control initiatives in the country’s
poultry industry. The procedures designed for breeder
farms aim to control the transmission of S. Pullorum,
S. Gallinarum, S. Enteritidis, and S. Typhimurium
based on measures that include vaccination, sanitary
culling, and termination of the incubation of eggs laid
by birds of infected breeder flocks, depending on the
category of bird involved (Brasil, 2003). MAPA has
also implemented regular flock surveillance to detect
S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium, and Salmonella spp.

in broilers before slaughter (Brasil, 2009). However,
Salmonella epidemiology is quite complex; therefore,
other serotypes that are also able to colonize the intesti-
nal tract of broilers and contaminate carcasses during
slaughter and processing may circulate in the broiler
production chain, posing an extra challenge to mini-
mizing the risks to the end consumers.

Studies to survey and track the pathogen may be
useful in Salmonella prevention and control programs,
which require scientific knowledge of the phenotypic
and genotypic diversity of the serotypes detected on
farms. In recent decades, traditional Salmonella typ-
ing methods, such as serotyping and phage typing,
have been complemented by molecular assays that af-
ford higher discrimination and reproducibility (Tenover
et al., 1995; Verge et al., 2005). Among these, pulsed-
field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is considered the gold
standard for the molecular subtyping of Salmonella,
with a proven contribution to investigations on the ori-
gin and spread of the pathogen (Ribot et al., 2006;
Favier et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2013).

In Brazil, there are few studies published about
nontyphoidal Salmonella serotypes on broiler farms,
and those we do have are from several years ago
(Tavechio et al., 2002; Kanashiro et al., 2005). Other
studies have foucused only on S. Enteritidis due to pub-
lic health issues (Oliveira et al., 2005; Ribeiro et al.,
2007; Vaz et al., 2010). Therefore, additional
infor-
mation is needed to better understand the current
distribution of Salmonella serotypes in broiler farms.
More information is also needed to evaluate the im-
pact of the official control program on the Brazilian
poultry industry. The objectives of this study were to
1) determine the serotype and genotype diversity of
Salmonella spp. isolates collected from broiler farms
managed by different large-scale broiler-producing com-
panies in Brazil, 2) analyze the antimicrobial resistance
profile of these strains, and 3) test the relationship be-
tween the serotypes and antimicrobial resistance pro-
files and the broiler-producing companies where the
isolates were detected.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sampling

This study comprised a total of 1,543 drag swabs re-
ceived at the laboratory between 2009 and 2010 for
salmonellosis diagnosis on commercial broiler farms.
Samples were taken from broiler farms from 10 com-
panies with integrated production systems in the states
of Santa Catarina, Paran´a, and Mato Grosso do Sul as
part of the Salmonella surveillance program in flocks.
These states accounted for 50.82% of the broiler pro-
duction in Brazil
in 2013 (UBABEF, 2014). A sin-
gle broiler house was sampled at each farm. Each
sample consisted of a pool of 2 drag swabs collected with
sterile disposable socks moistened with 1% buffered
peptone water (BPW) and worn over the boots. Then

the collector walked along the broiler house, from wall
to wall. Next, the socks were placed in a sterile plas-
tic bag that was transported to the laboratory on ice
and processed within 48 h from sampling. All surveyed
broiler flocks were grown from breeder flocks vaccinated
against S. Enteritidis.

Salmonella Isolation, Identiﬁcation,
and Serotyping

The MAPA-recommended isolation protocol was
used (Brasil, 1995). Drag swabs were pre-enriched in
brain heart infusion broth (BHI; Difco, Detroit, MI)
at 37oC for 18 to 24 h. Aliquots of this cultivation
medium were individually inoculated in tetrathionate
broth (Difco) and Rappaport-Vassiliadis broth (Difco),
incubated at 42oC for 18 to 24 h, streaked on bril-
liant green agar (Difco) and Rambach agar (Becton
Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and incubated at 37oC
for 24 h. Suspected colonies were confirmed by biochem-
ical and seroagglutination assays in polyvalent antigen
on a slide. The isolates were preserved at –70oC until
use.

Complete antigenic characterization and serotype
identification were carried out in the National Reference
Laboratory for Cholera and Enteric Diseases, Oswaldo
Cruz Institute (FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil)
with the rapid slide agglutination test using the somatic
and flagellar antisera produced by the laboratory.

Determination of Antimicrobial
Susceptibility

Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the
disk diffusion method according to the Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, 2008). The
measurement and interpretation of
inhibition halos
was performed using the criteria defined in the ap-
proved standards M31-A3 (CLSI, 2008) and M100-
S21 (CLSI, 2011), when appropriate. The Escherichia
coli ATCC 35922 strain was used to ensure the va-
lidity of the testing. The following antibiotic disks
(DME, Niter´oi, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) were used:
amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, 20/10 µg (Amc); cef-
tiofur, 30 µg (Cef); ciprofloxacin, 5 µg (Cip); col-
istin, 10 µg (Ct); enrofloxacin, 5 µg (Enr); strepto-
mycin, 10 µg (Str); fosfomycin, 200 µg (Fos); gentam-
icin, 10 µg (Gen); norfloxacin, 10 µg (Nor); trimetho-
prim with sulfamethoxazole, 23.75/1.25 µg (Ts); and
tetracycline, 30 µg (Tet). Strains that presented resis-
tance to 3 or more classes of antimicrobials were con-
sidered multiresistant (Schwarz et al., 2010).

Pulsed-ﬁeld Gel Electrophoresis

Isolates were genotyped by DNA macrorestriction
analysis using 40 U of the enzyme Xba I (New Eng-
land Biolabs, Beverly, MA) followed by PFGE, as

previously described (Ribot et al., 2006). S. Ty-
phimurium LT2 was used as a size standard. Restric-
tion fragments were electrophoresed in certified 1.2%
PFGE agarose gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) in tris-
borate buffer (TBE; Tris-borate 0.045 M, EDTA 0.001
M) at 14oC using the CHEF Mapper XA system (Bio-
Rad), with an initial switch time of 2.2 s and a final
switch time of 63.8 s at 6 V/s for 18 h. Gels were stained
in ethidium bromide (1 μg/mL) and visualized under
UV light. Images were captured using a digital cam-
era, and macrorestriction patterns were compared using
Bionumerics 4.0 software (version 6.1) (Applied Maths,
Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium). The similarity was cal-
culated by the Dice coefficient with a 1.7% tolerance.
A dendrogram was generated by cluster analysis using
the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic av-
erages (UPGMA). Strains sharing the same number
and position of DNA macrorestriction fragments were
considered to belong to the same genotype.

Multiple Correspondence Analysis

Descriptive analyses were carried out to reveal the
origin and phenotypic characteristics (serogroups and
antimicrobial resistance) of the strains. These analyses
were followed by a multiple correspondence analysis to
evaluate how broiler-producing companies, Salmonella
serogroups, and resistance to each chosen antimicrobial
drug were related. The illustrative variables, Salmonella
serogroups and number of antimicrobials to which resis-
tance were observed, were plotted against the generated
profile map. The multiple correspondence analysis was
carried out using Syst`eme Pour Analyse de Donn´ees
(SPAD) software, PC version (Centre International de
Statistique et d’Informatique Appliqu´es, Saint-Mand´e,

France), taking into account only the companies where
five or more Salmonella strains were isolated.

RESULTS

Salmonella Isolates and Serotyping

In total, 82 Salmonella spp. strains were isolated out
of 1,543 analyzed samples. A total of 15 serotypes were
identified, of which Minnesota, Infantis, Heidelberg,
Senftenberg, and Mbandaka were the most common, in
this order. Five strains were identified as the Salmonella
enterica subspecies enterica and presented the following
antigen formulae: O:4,5:-:1,2 (2/82); O:13,23:i:- (1/82);
O:4,5 (1/82); and O:9,12 (1/82).

S. Minnesota was the most frequent serotype in
the samples from the state of Mato Grosso do Sul
(33/38, 86.8%). Four other serotypes were detected in
the same state. In Paran´a, 13 serotypes were identi-
fied, among which S. Infantis was the most prevalent
(10/29, 34.5%). In the state of Santa Catarina, 10 dif-
ferent serotypes were detected, and S. Senftenberg was
the most common (5/15, 33.3%).

Antimicrobial Susceptibility of Strains

Of the analyzed strains, 49 isolates (59.75%) pre-
sented resistance to 1 or more antimicrobials (Table 1).
Of these, 14 (17.07%) were resistant to 1 drug, and
24 (29.26%) were resistant to 2 drugs. Multiresistance
was observed in 8 isolates, 7 isolates (8.53%) were re-
sistant to 3 antimicrobial classes, and 1 isolate (1.22%)
was resistant to 4 antimicrobial classes. All of the
characterized strains were susceptible to fosfomycin,

Thirteen different resistance profiles were identified
(Figure 2), the most frequent of which were resis-
tance to tetracycline only (15.85%), to the combina-
tion tetracycline and trimethoprim with sulfamethox-
azole (10.97%), and to the combination streptomycin
and tetracycline (9.75%).

The Relationship between Phenotypic
Patterns and the Origin of Strains

Figure 3 shows the profile map generated by the
multiple correspondence analysis. On the bottom right,
broiler-producing companies 1, 5, and 6 were associated
with antimicrobial susceptibility and with serogroups
E1, C1, D1, and G, respectively. Susceptibility to
trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole and to strepto-
mycin was associated with serogroups B and K, re-
spectively. On the bottom left, Salmonella strains of
serogroup L (S. Minnesota) were closely associated
with company 3, just as serogroup E4 (S. Senftenberg)
was linked to company 4. In this group, companies 2,
3, and 4 were associated with resistance to tetracy-
cline, trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole, and strep-
tomycin, respectively. Because only one strain was re-
sistant to 5 antimicrobials (4 classes) (Table 1), there
was no direct association between this isolate and the
company plotted on the map.

Salmonella Genotype Diversity

PFGE differentiated the strains analyzed into 64
genotypes (Figure 2), of which 30 were identified in the
33 S. Minnesota strains, 8 in the 12 S. Infantis strains, 3
in the 6 S. Heidelberg strains, and 2 in the 5 S. Senften-
berg strains. The samples of the other serotypes were
of a single genotype. All of the genotyped Salmonella

serotypes presented PFGE profiles distinct from the
other serotypes. Most strains of S. Minnesota, S.
Infantis, S. Heidelberg, S. Senftenberg, and S. Mban-
daka formed specific clusters. S. Minnesota presented
the highest intraserotype genetic diversity, shown by
the number of obtained PFGE profiles, and only 3 of
these genotypes were shared by more than one strain.
In spite of this variability, most S. Minnesota strains
formed one main cluster, with similarity levels over
70% (Figure 2). Six strains (7.31%) of the serotypes
Ohio (1), Saintpaul (1), Cerro (2), Schwarzengrund (1),
and Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica (O:9,12)
could not be genotyped using the protocol adopted in
the present study. The samples that were genotyped
presented between 9 and 18 bands, whose sizes varied
between 35 and 821 kb (data not shown).

DISCUSSION

The present study identified several nontyphoidal
Salmonella strains isolated from drag swabs collected
from broiler farms in 3 Brazilian states. In total, 15
serotypes were identified and found to be distributed
unevenly in the surveyed region. S. Minnesota was
the most commonly isolated strain (40.24%), followed
by S. Infantis (14.63%), S. Heidelberg (7.31%), S.
Senftenberg (6.09%), and S. Mbandaka (6.09%)
(Table 1). However, most S. Minnesota strains were
from a single broiler-producing company (company 3)
in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, suggesting the re-
gional predominance and distribution of this serotype.
The variability of serotypes by geographical area has
also been reported by Yang et al. (2013).

S. Minnesota has been considered one of the most
prevalent serotypes in laying hens in Chad (Tabo et al.,
2013) and also in broiler farms in Belgium (CODA-
CERVA, 2014). However, it is rarely responsible for hu-
man salmonellosis outbreaks worldwide (CDC, 2013a,b;
EFSA, 2014). In contrast, S. Infantis is one of the

serotypes that is regularly surveyed in breeder flocks
in the European Union because it has been in-
volved in salmonellosis outbreaks in member countries
(CODA-CERVA, 2014 ; EFSA,2014). In turn, S. Hei-
delberg was listed among the 4 most commonly isolated
serotypes in broiler chickens and humans in the United
States from 1970 to 2009 (CDC, 2013a). In Brazil, S.
Heidelberg, S. Senftenberg, and S. Mbandaka have been
identified in broiler chickens for years (Tavechio et al.,
2002; Kanashiro et al., 2005; Duarte et al., 2009), but
there are no data concerning their occurrence in out-
breaks of salmonellosis in humans because the causal
serotype has not been characterized in most of these
events. Due to the multifactorial nature of Salmonella
transmission in the food chain, it is often not possible
to establish a correlation between the most prevalent
serotypes in poultry and the most common ones impli-
cated in officially reported human salmonellosis.

In the past two decades, S. Enteritidis was the pre-
dominant serotype in poultry flocks, broiler meat, and
table eggs in Brazil (Tavechio et al., 2002; Kanashiro
et al., 2005; Ribeiro et al., 2007; Duarte et al., 2009; Vaz
et al., 2010); however, it was not found in this study.
In fact, the gradual reduction in S. Enteritidis fre-
quency, in comparison to other nontyphoidal serotypes
isolated on broiler farms, has become apparent in our
laboratory during this period. This reduction may be
a consequence of Salmonella control programs imple-
mented by the Brazilian poultry industry. In addition
to the strict biosecurity measures adopted, the immune
prophylaxis of breeder flocks with inactivated vaccines
against S. Enteritidis began in 2003 under official super-
vision (Brasil, 2003), which may have helped reduce its
prevalence in broilers. The immunity given by vaccina-

tion also protects against antigenically similar serotypes
(Foley et al., 2011) and may have led to a drop in the
prevalence of related Salmonella serotypes. Actually, in
the present study, we identified only one isolate from
serogroup D (Table 1) that was antigenically related
to S. Enteritidis. It is estimated that when the preva-
lence of one serotype falls, other serotypes emerge and
take over its ecological niche (Verge et al., 2005; Foley
et al., 2008; Barrow et al., 2012). In Belgium, after the
implementation of vaccination as part of an integrated
control strategy for S. Enteritidis, several Salmonella
serotypes have emerged, taking over its former eco-
logical niche and subsequently disappearing (Jasson &
Butaye, 2012). Notably, a rise in the occurrence of S.
Minnesota has been seen in Belgium, from 2% in 2009
to 17.6% in 2012, when it became the second most com-
mon serotype in poultry (CODA-CERVA, 2014).

Regarding antimicrobial resistance, 59.75% of the
evaluated strains were resistant to one or more cho-
sen antimicrobials (Table 1). Multiresistance to 3 or
4 classes of antimicrobials was identified in 9.75%
of the strains. The highest levels of resistance were
found for tetracycline, streptomycin, and trimethro-
prim/sulfamethoxazole (Figure 1). Different antimicro-
bial resistance levels have been identified in Salmonella
spp. isolated from poultry worldwide. In Brazil, these
levels have been shown to vary between 56% and 100%
(Oliveira et al., 2005; Cardoso et al., 2006; Duarte
et al., 2009; Vaz et al., 2010). In the United States,
74.1% of strains isolated from chicken meat have been
found resistant to antimicrobials and, as in the present
study, the highest resistance frequencies were observed
for tetracycline (65.8%) (USDA, 2012). Salmonella
strains isolated from chicken have presented resistance

frequencies of 70.4% and 99.1% in China (Yang et al.,
2013; Lai et al., 2014) and 100% in Argentina (Favier
et al., 2013) and Spain ( ´Alvarez-Fernad´ez et al., 2012).
However, these results should be compared with care
due to the effect of variation in factors, such as method-
ology, antimicrobials tested, and origin of the strains
(Schwarz et al., 2010).

The high frequency of resistance to tetracycline is
expected because this antimicrobial was one of the
first adopted for use in animal production (Muhammad
et al., 2010). For instance, high levels of resistance to
tetracycline have been observed in Salmonella spp. iso-
lated from chicken meat sampled at processing plants
in Brazil, ranging from 80% (Ribeiro et al., 2007) to
100% (Cardoso et al., 2006). Although tetracyclines
were banned as additives in animal feed in Brazil in
1998, they are still used therapeutically and therefore
exert selective pressure on microorganisms. In addition,
the emergence of bacteria resistant to cephalosporins
and fluoroquinolones raises concerns. Both classes of
antimicrobials are used to treat severe human infec-
tions, and resistance to these drugs may cause grave
complications in terms of successful treatment (Verge
et al., 2005; Hur et al., 2012; Kilonzo-Nthenge et al.,
2013; Lai et al., 2014). In the present study, 12.19%
of the strains were resistant to ceftiofur (Figure 1), a
third-generation cephalosporin that has been approved
for veterinary use. Although resistance to this antimi-
crobial was low in the analyzed strains, these find-
ings may also indicate a decrease in the susceptibility
to other cephalosporins (Zhao et al., 2008; Lai et al.,
2014). In Brazilian hatcheries, ceftiofur has been used
in chicks during their first day of life and may represent
a critical factor in the selection of resistant strains. On
the other hand, all Salmonella strains were susceptible
to fluoroquinolones tested in this study: enrofloxacin,
norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. Although enrofloxacin is
used exclusively in veterinary medicine, the resistance
to this antimicrobial may indicate increasing resistance
or a drop in susceptibility to other fluoroquinolones
of medical importance (Schwarz et al., 2010). For this
reason, the therapeutic use of enrofloxacin in produc-
tion animals has been questioned due to the possibility
that resistant strains might be transmitted to humans
through the food chain (Jones-Dias et al., 2013).

The multiple correspondence analysis linked the
antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella to broiler-
producing companies 1, 5, and 6, while antimicrobial
resistance was associated with companies 2, 3, and 4
(Figure 3). In Brazil, although antimicrobial classes li-
censed for therapeutic use in food-producing animals
and their respective judicious uses are defined in spe-
cific guidelines, the actual choice of the specific drugs
to be used is defined based on criteria that vary from
company to company. How these differences in choice
of the respective antimicrobial drugs actually influence
the susceptibility or resistance phenotypes of microbial
populations is unclear, and the data presented here did
not allow us to reach a conclusion on this subject. At

any rate, careful administration of antimicrobials and
continuous surveillance are important initiatives that
help define the best treatment and prevent the selec-
tion and spreading of resistant strains across flocks.

As a subtyping technique, PFGE has been widely
used because of its high discriminatory power (Ribot
et al., 2006; Favier et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2013).
In the present study, the analyzed Salmonella isolates
presented high genotypic variability (Figure 2 ) in the
number of identified serotypes and the diversity of
strains belonging to the same serotype. Most analyzed
S. Minnesota strains came from farms that were lo-
cated in the same geographic region and that oper-
ated in an integrated system of broiler production that
was managed by the same company. For this reason,
some S. Minnesota strains were closely related, show-
ing similarities of over 95% (Figure 2). Strains that
differ by two or three distinctive bands typically re-
sult from one single mutation, e.g., a DNA insertion
or deletion, which generates the subtypes of an ances-
tral strain. This type of change has been observed in
strains subcultured several times or reisolated from the
same patient (Tenover et al., 1995). This suggests that
strains that grouped into clusters of high genetic simi-
larity may actually be subtypes of the same sample that
have spread over space and time. On the other hand,
the total genetic variability between clusters (Figure 2)
suggests the inexistence of a clonal relationship, indi-
cating that S. Minnesota transmission on the surveyed
farms was predominantly horizontal and through differ-
ent contamination sources. Actually, the epidemiology
of Salmonella in poultry farming is quite complex, and
the bacteria may be introduced on farms through dif-
ferent sources, such as feed, water, insects, rodents, and
even the boots worn by the workers (Foley et al., 2008).
Among the other serotypes, most S. Infantis strains
presented a similarity of over 90%, a value that was
also observed for all S. Heidelberg and S. Senften-
berg strains, which reveals little intraserotype vari-
ability. Four S. Infantis and 4 S. Heidelberg strains
isolated from farms controlled by different broiler-
producing companies presented one same genotype in
each serotype, although the absence of epidemiological
information about these samples does not allow us to
infer their origin. Among the 5 analyzed S. Senften-
berg strains, 4 shared the same PFGE profile, which
was closely related to the alternative genotype that was
also identified in this serotype (Figure 2). Although a
small number of S. Senftenberg isolates was analyzed,
the close relationship between these strains also sug-
gests a common origin, an assumption supported by
the association of serogroup E4, to which they belong,
with broiler company 4 (Figure 3). As a rule, PFGE
revealed high genetic variability between the isolated
Salmonella strains, suggesting that the bacteria entered
farms through a variety of contamination sources.

In conclusion, S. Minnesota was the most frequent
serotype in the sampled broiler flocks and was con-
centrated in one geographical area (the state of Mato

Grosso do Sul). Other nontyphoidal Salmonella, such as
S. Infantis, S. Heidelberg, S. Senftenberg, and S. Mban-
daka, were found in the states of Paran´a and Santa
Catarina. In contrast to previously published results,
S. Enteritidis was not isolated in the present study,
which suggests a profile change of the most frequent
nontyphoidal serotypes in the Brazilian broiler indus-
try. Approximately 60% of the strains were resistant
to at least one of the evaluated antimicrobials, mainly
tetracycline. All isolates were susceptible to fosfomycin,
norfloxacin, enrofloxacin, colistin, and ciprofloxacin.
The susceptibility or resistance of the analyzed strains
was associated with the broiler-producing companies
where the samples were collected, while Salmonella
serogroups L and E4 showed a strong correlation with
particular broiler-producing companies sampled. Ad-
ditionally, the genetic diversity of the Salmonella
strains suggests the involvement of different transmis-
sion sources on the surveyed farms. These results reveal
the need, due to public health concerns, for continuous
surveillance and molecular typing and subtyping analy-
ses as ancillary tools in strategies to control Salmonella
on broiler farms.
