Abstract The objectives of this study were to determine the
presence and prevalence of non-O157 shiga toxin-producing
Escherichia coli (STEC) isolates from faeces of healthy fat-
tailed sheep and detection of phylogenetic background and
antibiotic resistance profile of isolates. One hundred ninety-
two E. coli isolates were recovered from obtained rectal swabs
and were confirmed by biochemical tests. Antibiotic resis-
tance profiles of isolates were detected and phylogenetic
background of isolates was determined according to the pres-
ence of the chuA, yjaA and TspE4.C2 genetic markers. The
isolates were examined to determine stx1, stx2 and eae genes.
Non-O157 STEC isolates were identified by using O157
specific antiserum. Forty-three isolates (22.40 %) were posi-
tive for one of the stx1, stx2 and eae genes, whereas 10.42 %
were positive for stx1, 19.38 % for eae and 2.60 % for stx2
gene. None of the positive isolates belonged to O157
serogroup. Twenty isolates possessed stx1 were distributed in
A (six isolates), B1 (13) and D (one) phylogroups, whereas
stx2 positive isolates fell into A (three isolates) and B1 (two)
phylogenetic groups. Eighteen isolates contained eae gene
belonged to A (five isolates), B1 (seven) and D (six) phy-
logroups. The maximum and minimum resistance rates were
recorded against to penicillin and co-trimoxazole respectively.
The positive isolates for stx1, stx2 and eae genes showed
several antibiotic resistance patterns, whereas belonged to A,
B1 and D phylogroups. In conclusion, faeces of healthy sheep
could be considered as the important sources of non-O157
STEC and also multidrug-resistant E. coli isolates.

Introduction

Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) or verotoxin-
producing E. coli (VTEC) and particularly E. coli O157:H7,
have emerged as the important zoonotic food-borne pathogens
and confirming the risk to public health (Fernández et al.
2012; Paris et al. 2010). The most common STEC serotype
associated with human disease is O157, but there is a growing
recognition of over 100 non-O157 serotypes that also may
result in human illness. Some of these non-O157 STEC strains
cause outbreaks of diarrhoea and severe disease such as hae-
molytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and haemorrhagic colitis
(Coombes et al. 2011; Nguyen and Sperandio 2012).
Sources of human infection with STEC strains and outbreaks
occur through ingestion of contaminated food or water includ-
ing: undercooked meat, unpasteurised milk and dairy prod-
ucts, vegetables or water and contact with animal carriers or
the environment (Pacheco and Sperandio 2012; Sanchez et al.
2010). Apparently, healthy cattle have been reported to be a
major reservoir of STEC (VTEC); however, several studies
suggest that other wild and domesticated ruminants may be
important in contributing to human clinical cases (Ferens and
Hovde 2011). The presence of E. coli O157:H7 has been
reported in sheep and lamb products and/or faecal samples
internationally (Kumar et al. 2012; Momtaz et al. 2012). On
the other hand, cattle and sheep have been shown to carry non-
O157 STEC strains, which mostly belong to O26, O111,
O103, O121, O45 and O145 serogroups (Bai et al. 2012;
Evans et al. 2008).

Two main virulence factors of STEC are Shiga toxins
(Stx) 1 and 2 encoded by stx1 and stx2 genes respectively,
which inhibit protein synthesis in mammalian cells. Several
additional virulence factors, among many others, are a
plasmid-encoded enterohemolysin and, in strains lacking
intimin, an autoagglutinating adhesin (Saa) which could be
involved in adhesion (Alonso et al. 2012; Andrade et al.

642

2012). The eae virulence gene, which encodes an outer mem-
brane protein, intimin involved in the intimate attachment of
the E. coli O157:H7 to the intestinal epithelium and induces
attaching and effacing (AE) lesions (Bandyopadhyay et al.
2011).

The emergence of antibiotic resistance in both commen-
sal and pathogenic strains has become an important public
health issue (Saei et al. 2010). Development and persistence
of antibiotic resistance in commensal and non-pathogenic
bacteria is one of worldwide concerns, because they are
thought to act as a reservoir of resistance genes capable of
transferring genes to foodborne and other zoonotic patho-
gens (Zhang et al. 2009).

According to phylogenetic studies, E. coli strains can be
assigned to one of the four main phylogenetic groups, A,
B1, B2 and D, which can be divided into seven subgroups
(Carlos et al. 2010). A study on molecular characterization
of STEC isolates from ruminant and donkey raw milk
samples and traditional dairy products in Iran showed that
samples from sheep were positive for O157 and non O157
STEC strains (Momtaz et al. 2012). According to FAOSTAT
(2010) report on livestock numbers of Iran, sheep are by far
the most numerous farm animal, followed by goats, cattle,
donkeys, horses, water buffalo and mules. The objectives of
this study were (1) to determine the presence and prevalence
of O157 and non-O157 STEC isolates from faeces of
healthy sheep in southeastern of Iran; (2) to investigate the
phylogenetic distribution and antibiotic resistance profile of
the shiga toxin and intimin genes possessed isolates.

Materials and methods

Bacterial isolates

Rectal swab samples were obtained from 192 apparently
healthy fat-tailed sheep between June 2010 and February
2011. The sampled animals were originated from eight
flocks in Kerman province (southeastern), Iran. The flocks
were in traditional husbandry conditions and there was not
any history of previous antibiotic therapy. Each of the sam-
pled flocks included nearly 80–120 sheep, which 20–25
sheep were chosen for sampling from each flock. One
hundred and sixty-eight of the sampled sheep were 2–3 years
old and 24 animals were 4 years old. Among the 192
sampled sheep, 153 were female and 39 were male. Swab
samples were streaked onto Mac Conkey agar (Biolife
Laboratories, Milan, Italy) and the plates were incubated at
37 °C for 24 h. After overnight incubation, suggestive of E.
coli colonies were further streaked onto eosin methylene
blue and incubated overnight at 37 °C again. Green metallic
sheen colonies indicative of E. coli were subjected to bio-
chemical tests, which included indole, methyl red, Voges–

Proskauer and Simmons citrate tests for E. coli identifica-
tion. The confirmed E. coli isolates were stored in Luria-
Bertani broth (Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland) with 30 %
sterile glycerol at −80 °C. From each sample, one confirmed
isolate were chosen for serology and antibiotic susceptibility
tests and PCR assays.

Reference strains of Sakaï (eae+, stx1+ and stx2+) and
ECOR62 (chuA+, yjaA+ and TspE4 C2+) were used as
positive controls. Non-pathogenic E. coli strain MG1655
was used as a negative control for target genes.

Antimicrobial susceptibility test

Antibiotic resistance profile of isolates against eight selected
antibacterial agents was determined by disc diffusion meth-
od according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute’s guidelines (CLSI 2004). The following antimi-
crobial discs (Padtan-Teb, Tehran, Iran) were used in disc
diffusion assay: co-trimoxazole (SXT; 25 μg), cephalexin
(CN; 30 μg), ciprofloxacin (CP; 5 μg), enrofloxacin (NFX;
5 μg), kanamycin (K; 30 μg), oxytetracycline (T; 30 μg),
penicillin (P; 10 μg) and streptomycin (S; 10 μg).

PCR assays

Freshly grown over night cultures of E. coli isolates and
reference strains were used for DNA extraction by boiling.
Two multiplex PCR reactions were used to screen each E.
coli isolate for the presence of stx1, stx2, eae, chuA, yjaA and
TspE4 C2 genes. Specific primers (TAG Copenhagen,
Denmark) used for amplification of the genes are presented
in Table 1. DNA extracts of isolates were tested by PCR
assay for the presence of the stx1, stx2 and eae genes as
described by China et al. (1996). According to the presence
and/or absence of the three genetic markers (chuA, yjaA and
TspE4.C2) four main phylogenetic groups (A, B1, B2 and
D) and seven phylogenetic subgroups (A0, A1, B1, B22,
B23, D1 and D2) were determined (Clermont et al. 2000;
Gordon et al. 2008).

O157 serogroup determination

O serogroup of stx1, stx2 and eae-positive E. coli isolates
were examined for the presence and/or absence of O157
serogroup by using of specific O157 antiserum according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations. (Mast Diagnostics,
Mast Group Ltd., Merseyside, England).

results for determination of phylogenetic groups showed
that the E. coli isolates belonged to three main groups A
(42.71 %), B1 (48.44 %) and D (8.85 %). None of the
isolates belonged to B2 group or its subgroups.
Phylogenetic subgroups classification revealed that 93 iso-
lates fell in to B1 group, whereas 99 isolates (51.56 %) fell
into four phylogenetic subgroups: 34 isolates (17.71 %) into
A0, 48 isolates (25.00 %) into A1, 12 isolates (6.25 %) into
D1 and 5 isolates (2.60 %) into D2 (Table 2).

Multiplex PCR tests results showed that 43 isolates
(22.40 %) were positive for one of the stx1, stx2 and eae genes.
According to the results all of the positive isolates had only
one of the stx1, stx2 and eae genes and there is not any
combination of the examined genes in the positive isolates.
Out of positive E. coli isolates, 20 (10.42 %) were positive for
stx1, 18 (9.38 %) for eae and 5 isolates (2.60 %) for stx2 gene.
According to serological tests none of the Stx- and intimin-
positive isolates belonged to O157 serogroup. Twenty isolates
possessed stx1 were distributed in A (six isolates), B1 (13
isolates) and D (one isolate) phylogroups, whereas belonged
to phylogenetic subgroups A0, A1, B1 and D1 (Table 2). The
stx2-positive isolates fell into A (three isolates) and B1 (two
isolates) phylogenetic groups. Eighteen isolates contained eae
gene belonged to A (five isolates), B1 (seven isolates) and D
(six isolates) phylogroups, which fell into A1, B1, D1 and D2
phylogenetic subgroups (Table 2).

Antibiogram of isolates against eight antibiotics showed
that all of the 192 isolates were resistant against two or more
examined antibacterial agents. The most prevalent resistance

were recorded against to penicillin (98.44 %), cephalexin
(94.79 %) and oxytetracycline (91.15 %). The minimum
resistance rates were against co-trimoxazole (51.04 %) and
ciprofloxacin (61.98 %), respectively (Table 3). The resistant
isolates were distributed in all of the detected phylogenetic
groups and subgroups, whereas their prevalence in each phy-
logroup differed in relation to tested antibiotics (Table 3).

Results of antibiotic susceptibility tests showed that 192
E. coli isolates could be classified in 16 different groups
according to antibiotic resistance patterns. Fifty-five isolates
(28.65 %) were resistant to all of the tested antibiotic, which
were the most prevalent antibiotic resistance pattern fol-
lowed by CN, K, NFX, P, S, T and CN, CP, K, NFX, P, S,
T patterns were found in 14.58 and 14.06 % of isolates,
respectively. Prevalence of 16 detected antibiotic resistance
patterns in each phylogenetic group and subgroups are pre-
sented in Table 4.

The 43 positive isolates for one of the stx1, stx2 and eae
genes showed several antibiotic resistance patterns which
were distributed in three phylogenetic groups A, B1 and D.
Distribution of positive E. coli isolates in phylogenetic
groups according to multi-drug resistance patterns are pre-
sented in Table 5.

human. Non-O157 STEC isolates are also associated with
HUS, whereas retrospective reports have estimated that 37–
50 % of STEC infections per year are caused by non-O157
STEC organisms (Schaffzin et al. 2012). In general, human
infections with STEC strains occurs after consumption of
contaminated food or contact with an infected animal or
human, therefore identification of the sources of infection
is an important step towards decreasing the prevalence of
this pathogen and thus decreasing the risk of infection of
humans (Ayala et al. 2010; Pedersen et al. 2006). Cattle and
sheep are thought to be the major reservoir of STEC and
often carry STEC in their intestinal flora and serve as source
of food contamination (Martin and Beutin 2011). Although
there are several reports of isolation and characterization of

STEC from cattle, there is limited information about the
prevalence of STEC in small ruminants (Bhat et al. 2008;
Coombes et al. 2011). In the present study, 25 isolates
(13.02 %) were positive for Stx1 (20 isolates) and Stx2 (five
isolates) coding genes, which do not belonged to O157
serogroup. Therefore, these isolates were considered as
non-O157 STEC isolates. In Spain, STEC O157:H7 strains
were isolated from one percent of animals in six flocks,
whereas non-O157 STEC strains were isolated from 35 %
of lambs in 33 flocks (Rey et al. 2003). Another study on E.
coli isolates from healthy cattle, sheep and swine herds in
northern Spain revealed that 8.7 and 50.8 % of ovine iso-
lates were positive for O157:H7 and non-O157 STEC sero-
types, respectively (Oporto et al. 2008). Blanco et al. (2003)

have isolated STEC O157:H7 strains from 0.4 % faecal
swabs of healthy lambs in 93 flocks and non-O157 STEC
strains were isolated from 36 % lambs in 63 flocks. In India,
a study on E. coli isolates from lambs with and without
diarrhoea indicated that 9.6 and 24.1 % of isolates belonged
to STEC pathotype, respectively (Wani et al. 2009).
Contamination of meat and raw milk by the main pathogen-
ic O157 and non-O157 (O26, O103, O111 and O145) STEC
O-serogroups representing a major public health concern
(Perelle et al. 2007). Similarly, non-O157 STEC pathotype
were isolated from Spanish raw ewe’s milk cheese, whereas
the isolates belonged to O14 and nontypeable groups (Caro
and García-Armesto 2007). Evans et al. (2008) have recov-
+ E. coli isolates from 4 % of
ered O26 vtx1
faecal samples of healthy sheep, whereas all of the positive
isolates carried eaeA gene. PCR analysis of carcass, faeces
and fleece samples from Irish lambs showed that both the vt1
and vt2 genes were carried by E. coli O157:H7 isolates
(Lenahan et al. 2007).

In this study, any combination of examined virulence
genes was detected. In contrast to these results, various
combinations of stx1, stx2 and eae genes in non-O157
STEC isolates from sheep were reported previously (Evans
et al. 2008; Momtaz et al. 2012). In non-O157 STEC strains
from lamb 55 % of strains carried the stx1 gene, 3 % pos-
sessed the stx2 gene and 42 % carried both the stx1 and the
stx2 genes (Rey et al. 2003). According to the results, 18
isolates 9.38 % possessed eae gene. Enteropathogenic E.

diarrhoeagenic E. coli isolates that possess the ability to
form AE lesions on intestinal cells and that do not possess
genes coding for shiga toxins (Alonso et al. 2012; Bhat et al.
2008). STEC and EPEC isolates are commonly recovered
from the faeces of food-producing animals and pose threats
to health of humans and livestock (Wani et al. 2009).
Vettorato et al. (2009) showed that eae-positive isolates
from faeces of Brazilian sheep belonged to non-O157
serogroups O128, O145, O153 and O178.

Regarding to the results, all of the stx1 and stx2-positive
isolates were negative for intimin coding gene. The absence
of the eae gene in the VTEC strains could indicate that these
strains are less virulent for humans that the classical eae-
positive enterohaemorrhagic E. coli types (Cortes et al.
2005). Wani et al. (2009) have detected eae gene in 46.2
and 36.8 % of STEC isolates from lambs with and without
diarrhoea, respectively.

In the current study, phylogenetic background of E. coli
isolates were detected, which were distributed in A
(42.71 %), B1 (48.44 %) and D (8.85 %) groups.
Phylogenetic group determination of faecal E. coli isolates
from human and animals indicated that strains from group
B1 were present in all hosts analysed but were more prev-
alent in sheep, goat and cow samples (Carlos et al. 2010).
Similar to the results of this study, none of the faecal isolates
from domesticated animals in South Korea belonged to B2
group (Unno et al. 2009). Johnson et al. (2005) reported that
conversion to antibiotic resistance occurs more readily in
non-B2 phylogenetic groups of E. coli strains. This link

between strain phylogeny and antibiotic resistance could ex-
plain why in farm animals subjected to antibiotic pressure, A
and B1 strains are selected and B2 strains counter selected
(Escobar-Paramo et al. 2006). Examination of 29 E. coli from
sheep revealed that the isolates fell into three B1 (20 isolates), D
(five) and A (four) phylogroup (Carlos et al. 2010). The possi-
ble influence of geographic conditions, dietary factors, use of
antibiotics and/or host genetic factors on the distribution of
phylogenetic groups has been reported (Unno et al. 2009).

Phylogenetic analysis of stx1- and stx2-positive isolates
showed that the isolates belonged to B1 (15 isolates), A
(nine) and D (one isolate) groups. In the USA, 2 % of E. coli
isolates from diverse human and animal sources belonged to
STEC strains. On the other hand, the majority of the STEC
strains, which were initially isolated from the ruminants sheep,
goats and deer, carried the stx1c and/or stx2d, ehxA and saa
genes and belonged to E. coli phylogenetic group B1 (Ishii et
al. 2007). Phylotyping of enterohaemorrhagic (EHEC) and
intimin-positive STEC isolates from animals mostly segregated
in B1 (38.7 %) and A (35.5 %) phylogenetic groups (Tramuta
et al. 2008). Phylogenetic study on human diarrheagenic E. coli
isolates showed that EHEC strains were distributed in phy-
logroups A and B1 (Gordon et al. 2008).

In the current study, prevalence of antibiotic resistance was
detected and phylogenetic background of multi-drug resistant
isolates was determined. In comparison to the results of cur-
rent study, different prevalences of antibiotic-resistant isolates
have been reported in ovine isolates from Great Britain,
Greece and New Zealand (Enne et al. 2008; Solomakos et
al. 2009; Yu et al. 2010). Due to the enormous exploitation of
antibiotics in the field of veterinary medicine, problems asso-
ciated with the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria have
reached epidemic proportions in recent years (Saei et al.
2010). It is believed that retail foods, and especially meat
and meat products, may be an important vehicle for
community-wide dissemination of antimicrobial-resistant E.
coli and extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (Sunde and
Norstrom 2006). On the other hand, a study on the effect of
antibiotic (tetracycline or streptomycin)-supplemented feed
on faecal enterohaemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 population in
lambs showed reduction in total number of E. coli O157:H7
shed in the faeces (Lema and Nahashon 2006).

In conclusion, in this part of world, faeces of healthy
sheep could be considered as the important sources of non-
O157 STEC pathotype and also multidrug-resistant E. coli
isolates. Regarding the presence of the isolates which were
positive only for eae gene, the researches on initial screen-
ing of eae-positive bacteria and eae gene subtyping from
ovine sources would help elucidate the role and importance
of these isolates. According to the high prevalence of multi-
drug resistance, it is important to monitor the resistance to
antibiotics not only in pathogenic isolates but also in com-
mensal bacteria of sheep origin.
