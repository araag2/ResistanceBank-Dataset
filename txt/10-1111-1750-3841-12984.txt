Abstract:
Escherichia coli have been shown to be present in humans and animals representing a signiﬁcant problem worldwide. This
study aimed to search the presence of ESBL and/or AmpC-producing E. coli in retail meats (chicken and beef) in Turkey.
A total of 88 β-lactamase-producing E. coli were isolated from chicken (n = 81/100) and beef meat (n = 7/100) samples
and their susceptibility to several antimicrobials were tested using disc diffusion method. E. coli isolates were further
characterized for their phylogenetic groups. β-Lactamase encoding (blaTEM, blaSHV, blaOXA, blaCTX-M, and blaAmpC) and
quinolone resistance genes (qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, qepA, and acc(6
)-Ib-cr) were also secreened by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). However, in regard to β-lactamase genes, 84 of 88 isolates were positive for blaCTX-M-1 (n = 39), blaCTX-M-3 (n = 5),
blaCTX-M-15 (n = 4), blaTEM-1b (n = 2), blaSHV-12 (n = 1), blaCTX-M-1/blaTEM-1b (n = 10), blaCTX-M-1/blaTEM-1b/blaSHV-5
(n = 1), blaCTX-M-1/blaCMY-2 (n = 1) and blaTEM-1b/blaCMY-2 (n = 6), blaCTX-M-15/blaSHV-12 (n = 1), blaCTX-M-15/blaTEM-1b
(n = 1), blaTEM-1b/blaSHV-12 (n = 1), and blaCMY-2 (n = 12) genes. Resistance to cefuroxime (75.6% and 85.7%),
nalidixic acid (89% and 85.7%), tetracycline (91.4% and 100%), streptomycin (40.2% and 100%), and trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole (36.6% and 85.7%) was observed among strains isolated from chicken and beef, respectively. However,
all isolates were found to be susceptible to amikacin, imipenem, and cefepime. Resistance to ampicillin and cefoxitin
was signiﬁcantly linked to blaCMY-2 gene, while there was a signiﬁcant correlation between CTX-M type ESBL and
antimicrobial resistance to cefuroxime and streptomycin (P < 0.05). The results of this study suggest that raw chicken
retail meats are highly contaminated with ESBL-producing E. coli implementing a great risk to human health in Turkey.

Practical Application: The occurrence of ESBL producing Escherichia coli in food of animal origin has been found to be
signiﬁcant risk factors for human health. In order to improve food safety in the chicken industry, it is of importance to
determine the carriage of this pathogen and its antimicrobial resistance against critically important antibiotics in human
health medicine. In the current study, raw chicken retail meats are highly contaminated with ESBL producing E. coli and
the situation has to be monitored regularly.

Introduction

Escherichia coli are one of the major causes of urinary tract infec-
tions (UTIs) and are associated with gastrointestinal upset, wound
infection, neonatal meningitis, pneumonia, and bacteremia (Kaya
and others 2013). Treatment of infections caused by E. coli is
becoming a serious problem because of the presence of resis-
tance against multiple antibiotics including β-lactams (Livermore
2008; Pitout 2010). The presence of β-lactam resistance among
E. coli appears to be a global increase partly in association with
certain antibiotic choices in health care settings (Bradford 2001,
Pitout 2010). β-Lactam-resistant E. coli have also been frequently
found to be resistant to other classes of antimicrobial agents in-
cluding ﬂuoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim–
sulfamethoxazole (Bradford 2001) resulting increased morbidity
and mortality, prolonged hospitalization and increased healthcare

Plasmid-mediated β-lactamases

[extended
(ESBLs) and AmpC β-lactamases

spectrum β-
lactamases
(AmpC)] have
been of great concern worldwide (Pitout and Laupland 2008).
They result
in resistance to β-lactam antibiotics (penicillins,
cephalosporins, and monobactams) mainly because of the break-
ing of β-lactam rings. AmpC type β-lactamases are clinically im-
portant cephalosporinases that are chromosomally mediated and
are also be carried on plasmids in many Gram-negative bacteria
(Jacoby 2009; Philippon and others 2002). AmpC β-lactamase,
particularly CMY-2,
the most widely distributed plasmid-
mediated AmpC have been commonly found in Enterobacteri-
aceae isolated from humans and animals worldwide (Ben Sallem
and others 2012). Extended spectrum β-lactameses (ESBLs) usu-
ally refers to resistance to the oxyimino-cephalosporins (such as
cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime) (Paterson and Bonomo
2005). There are more than 300 well-described ESBL subtypes
globally distributed owing to transmission of many plasmids from
cell to cell (Bonnet 2004; Liebana and others 2006) with CTX-
M most commonly reported subtype both in humans and an-
imals since the early 2000s (Livermore and others 2007). The
rapid increase in the proportion of ESBL-producing E. coli in

sheep) and pet animals have been occurred globally since 2000s
(Aarestrup and others 2006; Blanc and others 2006; Brinas and
others 2005; Jouini and others 2007). Therefore, prevalence of
ESBL-producing E. coli has been also appeared to be in in-
crease in various foodstuffs including raw milk, dairy products and
meat, particularly chicken meat which has already been recog-
nized as a signiﬁcant source of ESBL-producing E. coli in humans
(Overdevest and others 2011). Additionally, plasmids carrying ES-
BLs genes often contain the genes encoding resistance to other
drug classes including quinolone and aminoglycosides. For ex-
ample, it has been shown that E. coli isolates harboring CTX-M
type β-lactamases often contain the genes (qnrA, qnrB or qnrS and
(cid:2)
aac(6
)-Ib-cr) conferring quinolone resistance indicating the local-
ization of these genes on the same plasmid (Nordman and Poirel
2005).

To our knowledge, there has been no report on molecu-
lar characterization on β-lactam-resistant isolates from foods in
Turkey, despite the great importance of ESBLs and/or pAmpC
β-lactamase-producing E. coli in foods of animal origin. There-
fore, the main aim of the present study was to determine the
prevalence of β-lactamase-producing E. coli in meat samples from
retail outlets. The isolates obtained in this study were screened for
their resistance to several antimicrobials and further analysed for
the presence of ESBLs and AmpC types as well as phylogenetic
grouping. In addition, the presence of genes encoding resistance
(cid:2)
to quinolones (qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, qepA, and acc(6
)-Ib-cr) were also
screened. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study investigating the
genotypes of β-lactamase-producing E. coli isolates from raw meat
samples in Turkey.

Materials and Methods
Isolation of cefotaxime-resistant E. coli
Chicken (n = 100) and beef (n = 100) samples (frozen or
refrigerated) were collected from different markets and butcher
shops in Hatay region, Turkey, from February to June in 2012.
For the isolation of E. coli, each sample (ß25 g) was suspended
in 225 mL of sterile buffered peptone water and was mixed by
stomacher for 1 min. The suspension was incubated at 37 °C for
24 h. At the end of the incubation, 100 μL of the suspension
was plated on Eosine Methylene Blue (EMB) agar including cefo-
taxime (2 μg/mL) and then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h (Leininger
and others 2001). One colony showing typical E. coli morphology
were picked and subcultured on Columbia Blood Agar. The iden-
tiﬁcation was veriﬁed by Gram staining and classical biochemical
tests (IMVIC). Selected isolates were further conﬁrmed by PCR
using species speciﬁc primers conserving regions of the 16S rRNA
genes (Wang and others 2002). All primers used in this study were
listed in Table 1. Isolates were then stored in Tryptic Soy Broth
with 20% glycerol at −20 °C.

Antibiotic resistance of β-lactamase producing E. coli

Antimicrobial resistance of β-lactamase-producing E. coli were
determined against several antibiotics by disc diffusion method
according to the CLSI (2012). The following antibiotics were
used; ampicillin (10 μg), ceftazidime (30 μg), cefotaxime (30 μg),
ceftriaxone (30 μg), cefepime (30 μg), cefoxitin (30 μg), cefurox-
ime (30 μg), cephalothin (30 μg), aztreonam (30 μg), imipenem
(10 μg), nalidixic acid (30 μg), ciproﬂoxacin (5 μg), chloram-
phenicol (30 μg), gentamicin (10 μg), streptomycin (10 μg),
tobramycin (10 μg), amikacin (10 μg), kanamycin (30 μg),
trimethroprim–sulfamethoxazole
tetracycline
(30
(1.25/23.75 μg),
acid (20/10 μg).
For quality control, the ATCC standard strains E. coli (ATCC
25922) were used. Breakpoint values were selected based on the
recommendations of CLSI, (2012) to interpret the resistance.

Determination of phylogenetic groups of β-lactamase
producing E. coli

The phylogenetic analyses of ESBL and/or pAmpC producing
E. coli isolates were carried out by multiplex PCR (Clermont and
others 2000). Phylogenetic and subgroups (A0, A1, B1, B22, B23,
D1, and D2) were determined according to presence or absence
of the chuA, yjaA genes and DNA fragrment (TSPE4) as described
by Escobar-Paramo and others (2004).

Detection and characterization of β-lactamase and
quinolone resistance genes

In order to detect TEM, OXA, SHV, and CTX-M type
beta-lactamases, the blaTEM, blaOXA, blaSHV, and blaCTX genes
were ampliﬁed by PCR as previously described (Ahmed and
others 2007). To determine the exact subtypes of β-lactamase
genes, PCR products were directly sequenced (Sanger sequenc-
ing) from both ends by using sequencing PCR primers (Refgen,
Ankara). The sequencing data were compared with the previ-
ously published sequences in GenBank using the BLAST program
(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The presence of AmpC type
β-lactamese gene was tested using multiplex PCR as documented
by Perez-Perez and Hanson (2002). Subsequently, the presence of
blaCMY-2 was determined with primers in isolates that were found
to be positive in multiplex PCR (Zhao and others 2001). The
presence of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR)
genes qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, and qepA were examined by multiplex PCR
and sequencing (Robicsek and others 2006). The isolates contain-
(cid:2)
ing the aac(6
)-Ib-cr gene associated with resistance to quinolones
were also identiﬁed by PCR and sequencing as described previ-
ously (Robicsek and others 2006). The following strains, E. coli
(cid:2)
J53 pMG298, which encodes both aac(6
)-Ib-cr and qnrB1, and E.
coli TOP10 + pAT851 for qepA obtained from the Lahey Hospital
and Medical Center and Pasteur Institute, respectively were used
as positive control strains.

Phenotypic ESBL tests

ESBL production in cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates were
conﬁrmed by phenotypic disc combination method using both
cefotaxime (30 μg) and ceftazidime (30 μg) alone and in combi-
nation with clavulanic acid in order to detect ESBL production
according to the method published by the Clinical Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI, 2012). The presence of ESBL was de-
tected by an increase in the zone diameters (ࣙ5 mm) of either
ceftazidime or cefotaxime with clavulanic acid. For quality con-
trol, Klebsiella pneumonia (ATCC 700603) were used as the standard
strain.

Statistic

All statistical analyses were done using SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS,
Chicago, Ill., U.S.A.). Chi-square test was used to assess the sig-
niﬁcance in proportion of positive samples between sample types
(chicken and beef) and the associations of resistance to other an-
timicrobials with the occurrence of ESBL or pAmpC β-lactamase
and P value < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.

producing E. coli. Out of 100 raw chicken meat samples, 82
(82%) were found to be contaminated with cefotaxime-resistant
E. coli which were all conﬁrmed to be ESBL producer by disc
combination method. In regard to β-lactamase genes, 81 out
of 82 isolates were positive for blaCTX-M-1 (n = 39), blaCTX-M-3
(n = 4), blaCTX-M-15 (n = 4), blaTEM-1b (n = 2), blaSHV-12 (n = 1),
(n = 10), blaCTX-M-1/blaTEM-1b/blaSHV-5
blaCTX-M-1/blaTEM-1b
(n = 1), blaCTX-M-1/blaCMY-2 (n = 1) and blaTEM-1b/blaCMY-2
(n = 5), blaCTX-M-15/blaSHV-12 (n = 1), blaTEM-1b/blaSHV-12 (n = 1),
and blaCMY-2 (n = 12) genes (Table 2). For beef meat, 7 cefo-
taxime (2 μg/mL)-resistant E. coli isolates obtained from red meat
samples (n = 100) and they all showed ESBL characteristics by disc
combination method. Three out of 7 isolates carried following
β-lactamase genes blaCTX-M-3 (n = 1), blaCTX-M-15/blaTEM-1b
(n = 1), and blaTEM-1b/ blaCMY-2 (n = 1), whereas 4 phenotypic
ESBL-positive strains did not harbor tested genes (Table 2).
The rate of ESBL-producing E. coli contaminated meat was
signiﬁcantly higher (P < 0.001) in chicken (82%) than in the beef
samples (7%). There were no isolates detected with blaOXA. Three
isolates obtained from chicken meat samples harbored the qnrS

gene, whereas only one isolate was found to have qnrB. None
of the identiﬁed isolates had other genes (qnrA and aac(6’)-Ib-cr)
tested in this study.

Among isolates obtained from chicken samples, 62.1% belonged
to group D1, 10.9% to group D2, 9.7% to group A0, 7.3% to
group B23, 6.1% to group B1 and 3.6% to group A1. For beef
samples, distribution of phlogenetic group were as D1 (n = 6) and
B1 (n = 1) (Table 2).
The antimicrobial resistance proﬁle of 82 ESBL producing E.
coli isolated from chicken meat is given in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Brieﬂy, all chicken isolates were found to be resistant against
cefpodoxime and cepholothin. A total of 91.5% of the isolates
were resistant to tetracycline. 89% and 75.6% of the isolates
were found to be resistant to nalidixic acid and cefuroxime,
respectively (Figure 1). All isolates were susceptible to imipenem
and cefepime and only two isolates were found to be resistant
to cefotetan. All seven ESBL positive E. coli isolated from red
meat were resistant to cefpodoxime, streptomycin, cefuroxime,
and cepholothine. Six isolates out of 7 were resistant to tetra-
cycline, trimethroprim–sulfamethoxazole, and 5 were resistant

cefotetan, imipenem, cefoxitin, and cefepime. Statistical analyses
showed that ampicillin and cefoxitin resistance proﬁle were all
signiﬁcantly (P = 0.001) more associated with isolates that had
the blaCMY-2 gene alone. Conversely, cefuroxime and strepto-
mycin resistance were more strongly associated with isolates
having blaCTX-M genes (P < 0.05). In addition, kanamycin,
ciproﬂoxacin, trimethroprim—sulfamethoxazole, and chloram-
phenicol resistance were also present in isolates (blaCTX-M +
blaTEM-1b) at signiﬁcantly higher level when compared with only
blaCTX-M isolates (P < 0.05). However, only trimethroprim–
sulfamethoxazole resistance was signiﬁcantly higher in isolates
having blaCMY-2 + blaTEM-1b when compared to only blaCMY-2
(P = 0.036).
Discussion

Extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobac-
teriaceae, initially appeared in Europe in the 1980s, have since
been an important global problem (Nathisuwan and others 2004).
There have been numerous reports on isolation and molecular
characterization of ESBL producing E. coli from food producing
animals and a signiﬁcant increase in the prevalence of ESBL pro-
ducing E. coli in foods of animal origin has been also reported
(Egea and others 2012). In a study conducted in the Netherlands,
it is reported that there were high degree of similarity between
β-lactamase genes in E. coli between in humans and retail meat
suggesting that the possible transfer of these pathogens from an-
imals to humans (Overdevest and others 2011). In Turkey, pres-
ence of ESBL-producing E. coli was reported from retail meat by
G¨undogan and Avci (2013). However, these authors did not study
the genetic makeup of ESBLs obtained from food of animal ori-
gin. In the current study, chicken meat was found to be highly
contaminated (82%) with ESBL-producing E. coli whereas a low

prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli (%7) in beef samples was
found. Results obtained in the present study are not surprising
when compared with other reports in which ESBL-producing
E. coli in chicken meat to be 67% to 93.3% in Spain (Egea and
others 2012; Doi and others 2009), 76.8% to 94% in the Nether-
lands (Leverstein-van Hall and others 2011; Overdevest and others
2011), 85% in USA (Doi and others 2009), whereas only 4.7% and
9% of beef samples were found to be positive in the Netherlands
and Spain, respectively (Doi and others 2009; Overdevest and oth-
ers 2011). Recently, Egerv¨arn and others (2014) also found that
the prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli in chicken meat im-
ported from South America and Europe to Sweden were 95%
and 61%, respectively. Geser and others (2012) and Bortolai and
others (2010) were also isolated these pathogens from broilers in
Denmark and Switzerland which are the countries strictly apply-
ing antimicrobial usage rules. Geser and others (2012) attributed
this fact to the couple of reasons which can be summed as 3rd
and 4th generation cephalosporins are commonly used in veteri-
nary medicine and co-selection mechanisms for multiple resistance
mechanisms.

β-Lactamase (ESBL and plasmid mediated AmpC β-lactamase)
enzymes have been detected in E. coli isolated from various foods
including different retail meat samples in the world (Agersø and
others 2012, Leverstain-van Hall and others 2011). To our best
knowledge, this is, however, the ﬁrst report of the presence of
β-lactamase genes in E. coli isolated from retails meats in Turkey.
In this study, the most frequently detected gene was blaCTX-M-1,
alone and in combination with other ESBL genes. We also de-
tected that CTX-M-3 and CTX-M-15 type ESBLs carrying E.
coli strains were present in chicken and beef samples. These results
are consistent with previous reports in which a signiﬁcant increase
in E. coli carrying CTX-M was reported since 2000s (Livermore
and others 2007). In a study conducted in United Kingdom, the

β-Lactamase producing Escherichia coli . . .

blaCTX-M-1 gene was the most predominant ESBL type in E. coli
isolates obtained from chicken (Perez and others 2007). A similar
ﬁnding was also reported by Leverstain-van Hall and others (2011)
who found that blaCTX-M-1 was the predominant gene in E. coli
isolated from chicken meat in the Netherlands. However, Agersø
and others (2012) reported that CMY-2 was the most predomi-
nant type (48%) of enzymes among E. coli isolated from chicken
meat samples followed by CTX-M-1 (25%) in Spain, which is
not surprising as it was already reported that the proportion of
E. coli isolates with ESBL types vary according to the geograph-
ical origins (Ria˜no and others 2006; Egerv¨arn and others 2014).
CTX-M-15 ESBL type was reported as the dominant type in E.
coli isolates obtained from clinical samples in Turkey (Altınkum
and others 2013) and this enzyme was found in a small number of
isolates in this study. In our study, none of the isolates from meat
samples were OXA type ESBL producers which are rarely re-
ported among Enterobacteriaceae (K¨uc¨ukbasmacı and others 2008).
In addition, there has been a signiﬁcant association found between
the presence of ESBL genes, most notably blaCTX-M-15 and the
plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance PMQR genes (Nordman
and Poirel 2005). However, there are only four isolates harbored
the quinolone resistance genes in this study.

In our study, all isolates obtained from chicken and beef sam-
ples were resistant to cefpodoxime and cepholothin. Resistance to
tetracycline, nalidix acid, and cefuroxime were detected in 91.5%,
89%, and 75% in chicken isolates. However, all isolates obtained
from beef were found to be resistant to tetracycline and strepto-
mycin. The results obtained in this study are similar to those of
previous reports for food animal isolates (Geser and others 2012;
K¨uc¨ukbasmacı and others 2008). For example, in a study per-
formed by Geser and others (2012) in Switzerland, a total of 83.5%
of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated from poultry, cattle,
swine and sheep were also resistant to tetracycline. In another study
carried out by K¨uc¨ukbasmacı and others (2008), it was shown that
all ESBL producing isolates from food animals displayed resistance
to tetracycline in Turkey. The imprudent use of tetracycline and
quinolone in veterinary medicine may contribute to the high level
of resistance. In addition, no resistance to cefepime, amikacin, and
imipenem was detected in ESBL-producing E. coli. Imipenem is
the drug of choice for serious infections by ESBL-producing E.
coli in humans. The complete absence of imipenem resistance is
probably due to not using this agent in food producing animals.
In addition, it has been reported that ESBL-positive E. coli strains
isolated from non-human primates were found to have higher re-
sistance rates when compared with those of ESBL-negative strains
(Wang and others 2012). Similarly, the rate of isolates resistance to
cefoxitin, cefuroxime, and streptomycin in ESBL-producing iso-
lates was signiﬁcantly higher than in these harboring the blaCMY-2
gene in this study. These associations were previously explained
based on the carriage of antimicrobial resistance genes, particu-
larly to aminoglycosides, by mobile genetic elements like plasmids
(Wang and others 2012).

In conclusion, a high proportion of retail chicken meat samples
were found to contaminated with ESBL-producing E. coli. In ad-
dition, majority of isolates harbored CTX-M type ESBL including
CTX-M-15 suggesting that retail chicken might pose a signiﬁcant
hazard to the consumer. In this regard, there is, however, a need
to investigate the clonal relatedness between ESBL-producing E.
coli isolates obtained from human and food of animal origins in
Turkey. It is unrealistic to expect to control ESBL-producing E. coli
in food animals, hence in raw foods, especially those for chicken
meat, so that it has to be considered that regular surveillance

M2028 Journal of Food Science r Vol. 80, Nr. 9, 2015

program should be established to monitor the antimicrobial resis-
tance level for these organisms. It is also major importance that the
use of carbapenems has to be under control in veterinary medicine.
