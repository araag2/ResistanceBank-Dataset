Abstract 
Background:  Poultry remains one of the most important reservoir for zoonotic multidrug resistant pathogens. The 
global rise of antimicrobial resistance in Gram‑negative bacteria is of reasonable concern and demands intensified 
surveillance.
Methods:  In 2016, 576 cloacal swabs were collected from 48 broiler farms located in five governorates in northern 
Egypt. Isolates of Enterobacteriaceae could be cultivated on different media and were identified by MALDI‑TOF MS 
and PCR. Escherichia coli isolates were genotyped by DNA‑microarray‑based assays. The antimicrobial susceptibility 
to 14 antibiotics was determined and resistance‑associated genes were detected. The VITEK‑2 system was applied 
for phenotypical confirmation of extended‑spectrum β‑lactamase‑producing isolates. The determination of colistin 
resistance was carried out phenotypically using E‑test and genotypically using PCR for detection of the mcr‑1 gene.
Results:  Out of 576 samples, 72 representatives of Enterobacteriaceae were isolated and identified as 63 E. coli (87.5%), 
5 Enterobacter cloacae (6.9%), 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.8%) and 2 Citrobacter spp. (2.8%). Seven out of 56 cultivated E. 
coli (12.5%) were confirmed as ESBL‑producing E. coli and one isolate (1.8%) as ESBL/carbapenemase‑producing E. coli. 
Five out of 63 E. coli isolates (7.9%) recovered from different poultry flocks were phenotypically resistant to colistin and 
harboured mcr‑1 gene.
Conclusions:  This is the first study reporting colistin resistance and emergence of multidrug resistance in Enterobac-
teriaceae isolated from healthy broilers in the Nile Delta region, Egypt. Colistin‑resistant E. coli in poultry is of public 
health significance. The global rise of ESBL‑ and carbapenemase‑producing Gram‑negative bacteria demands intensi‑
fied surveillance. ESBL‑producing E. coli in poultry farms in Egypt are of major concern that emphasizes the possibil‑
ity of spread of such strains to humans. The results also reinforce the need to develop strategies and to implement 
specific control procedures to reduce the use of antibiotics.

Background
Poultry and their products are considered the main vehi-
cle for pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella (S.) sero-
vars,  Escherichia  (E.)  coli  and  Klebsiella  (K.)  spp.  that 
cause foodborne infections in humans [1–3].

The  prevalence  of  highly  antibiotic-resistant  E.  coli 
was recorded in poultry meat more frequently than in all 
other kinds of meat [4, 5].

Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) are plasmid-
encoded enzymes found in Gram-negative bacteria espe-
cially in Enterobacteriaceae conferring resistance to first, 
second  and  third  generation  cephalosporins  while  they 
are inhibited by clavulanic acid [6–10].

ESBL-producing  Enterobacteriaceae  have  emerged 
as pathogens in both poultry and humans [7, 11]. Many 
ESBL-producers are additionally multiresistant to non-β-
lactam antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones, aminogly-
cosides,  trimethoprim,  tetracyclines,  sulfonamides  and 
chloramphenicols [12, 13]. Resistance to cephalosporins 
is  mediated  by  ampicillin  class  C  β-lactamases  (AmpC 
β-lactamase) and encoded by blaCMY genes [14, 15]. Car-
bapenems are still the drugs of choice to treat infections 
with  ESBL-producing  Enterobacteriaceae  in  humans 
[16] and their increasing use reinforces the probability of 
resistance  development  to  carbapenems  among  Entero-
bacteriaceae [17–19]. The coexistence of multiple ESBL 
and  carbapenemase  genes  as  well  as  other  antibiotic 
resistance determinants on mobile elements is of a major 
concern that might lead to the emergence of organisms 
with resistance to all antibiotics [6, 20, 21].

Most  ESBLs  encoding  genes  in  bacteria  of  clinical 
interest  are  located  on  plasmids  [22].  These  plasmids 
may also carry genes encoding resistance to other drug 
classes  including  aminoglycosides  and  fluoroquinolones 
[23].  Transmission  of  ESBLs  genes  can  occur  either  by 
emerging bacterial clones or by horizontal gene transfer. 
In the latter case, plasmids containing resistance genes, 
spread  between  bacteria  [22].  Colistin  recently  gained 
attention as a last-resort antibiotic for treatment of infec-
tions caused by multidrug resistant Gram-negative bac-
teria. In veterinary practice, colistin is a drug of choice 
for  the  treatment  of  frequent  digestive  tract  infections 
caused  by  E.  coli  in  food-producing  animals  [24].  The 
irrational use of colistin in veterinary practice may be the 
main  cause  of  the  increasing  rate  of  colistin  resistance. 
Recently, the emergence of colistin resistance has caused 
great  concern  [25,  26]  and  resistance  mediated  by  the 
plasmid-borne mcr-1 gene has been detected worldwide 
in Enterobacteriaceae [27].

In some countries, antimicrobials are used in the poul-
try  industry  for  treatment  of  diseased  animals,  preven-
tion  of  diseases  and  promotion  of  growth  [28–30].  In 
Egypt, E. coli infections are considered as one of the most 

serious  diseases  leading  to  economic  losses  in  poultry 
production [31].

Unfortunately, there are no legislations in Egypt regu-
lating the use of antibiotics. Some of them such as tet-
racycline, quinolones and beta-lactams are still used for 
non-therapeutic uses [32]. This improper use of antimi-
crobials leads to rapid selection of multiresistant strains 
of Enterobacteriaceae in poultry and plays a key role in 
the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria along the food 
chain to humans [33–35].

In recent years, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ioni-
zation  time-of-flight  mass  spectrometry  (MALDI-TOF 
MS) has been applied as a wide-range technique for bac-
terial  identification  [36].  Microarray  systems  are  well-
established tools for rapid genotypic characterization of 
bacteria  and  identification  of  resistance  and  virulence-
associated determinants [37]. The data can be obtained 
in a single experiment with the benefit of saving time and 
money [38–40]. The broth microdilution method proved 
to be an easy and reliable method for determination of 
the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibi-
otics and can be used as an alternative technique to agar 
diffusion test [41–43].

The use of a rapid molecular assay as an alternative to 
phenotypic  detection  was  proved  to  be  a  useful  option 
for detection of antibiotic resistance to frequently applied 
antimicrobial agents in poultry production [43].

The objective of this study was to gain insight into the 
antimicrobial  susceptibility  of  Enterobacteriaceae,  espe-
cially E. coli originating from healthy broilers from dif-
ferent districts in northern Egypt and to understand its 
public  health  significance.  In  addition,  the  prevalence 
of  ESBL/carbapenemase-producing  E.  coli  and  colistin 
resistance were investigated.

Methods
Isolation and characterization of bacterial strains
During  2016,  576  cloacal  swabs  were  randomly  col-
lected  from  apparently  healthy  broilers  housed  in  48 
farms  located  in  five  governorates,  namely:  Dakahlia, 
Kafr El-Sheikh, Damietta, Gharbiya and Sharkiya, in the 
Nile Delta region, Egypt. An overview about investigated 
poultry  farms,  the  number  of  birds  and  the  number  of 
collected samples are given in Table 1. Sampling was car-
ried out using sterile cotton swabs. The collected samples 
were transported at 4 °C to the laboratory for microbio-
logical examination. The samples were enriched in Buff-
ered Peptone Water at 37 °C for 24 h and then streaked 
on  MacConkey  Agar  and  Eosin  Methylene  Blue  (EMB) 
Agar  (Oxoid,  Manchester,  UK),  followed  by  further 
incubation at 37 °C for 24 h. For identification of ESBL-
producing  Enterobacteriaceae,  the  enriched  bacterial

cultures were cultivated on Brilliance™ ESBL agar (Oxoid 
GmbH, Wesel, Germany) at 37 °C for 24 h.

Identification by MALDI‑TOF MS
Isolates  were  identified  using  MALDI-TOF  MS  [44]. 
Interpretation of results was performed according to the 
manufacturer’s  recommendation:  score  of  ≥ 2.3  repre-
sented reliable species level identification; score 2.0–2.29, 
probable species level identification; score 1.7–1.9, prob-
able genus level identification, and score ≤ 1.7 was con-
sidered an unreliable identification [45].

DNA extraction and purification
Genomic  DNA  was  extracted  from  bacterial  cultures 
using  High  Pure  PCR  Template  Purification  Kit  (Roche 
Diagnostics,  Mannheim,  Germany)  according  to  the 
instructions of the manufacturer.

Identification of E. coli isolates using PCR
The identified E. coli isolates were confirmed at species 
level using a specific PCR assay targeting 16S rRNA genes 
with primers ECO-1 (5′-GAC CTC GGT TTA GTT CAC 
AGA-3′)  and  ECO-2  (5′-CAC  ACG  CTG  ACG  CTG 
ACC A-3′) which geared from previous study by Seidavi 
et al. [46]. The PCR reaction was carried out with the fol-
lowing amplification conditions: An initial denaturation 
step at 96 °C for 60 s was followed by 35 cycles of dena-
turation (96 °C for 15 s), annealing (58 °C for 60 s) and 
extension (72 °C at 45 s) with a final extension at 72 °C 
for 60 s. PCR resulted in 585 bp amplicons. PCR prod-
ucts  were  analyzed  on  a  1.5%  agarose  gel,  stained  with 
ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light.

Genoserotyping of E. coli isolates using microarray assay
The  serotypes  of  E.  coli  isolates  were  determined  using 
the  E.  coli  SeroGenoTyping  AS-1  Kit  (Alere  Technolo-
gies GmbH, Jena, Germany). Five microliters of extracted 
RNA-free DNA (with a concentration of at least 100 ng/
μl) were biotin-labeled by a primer extension amplifica-
tion using E. coli SeroGenoTyping AS-1 Kit according to 
manufacturer’s  instructions.  The  procedures  for  multi-
plex labelling, hybridization and data analysis were car-
ried out as described in a previous study [47].

Phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility testing
The  antibiotic  susceptibility  testing  of  all  isolates  was 
performed with the MICRONAUT system using com-
mercial  96-well  microtiter  plates  (Merlin,  Bornheim, 
Germany) as recommended by the manufacturer. This 
system allowed the determination of minimum inhibi-
tory concentrations (MICs) of 14 antimicrobial agents 
(Tables 2, 3) in serial dilutions of the antibiotics. Over-
night grown bacteria were suspended in NaCl solution 
(0.9%) to obtain a turbidity corresponding to a McFar-
land  standard  of  0.5  (Dr.  Lange,  CADAS  photometer 
30,  Berlin,  Germany).  One  hundred  microliters  of  the 
suspension  were  diluted  with  10  ml  of  Mueller–Hin-
ton broth (Oxoid GmbH) resulting in a concentration 
of  approximately   106–107  colony  forming  units  (cfu)/
ml. In total, 100 µl of the inoculum were given in each 
well  of  the  plate.  After  sealing  the  plates,  they  were 
incubated for 18 h to 24 h at 37 °C. Reading of plates 
was done with a photometer (Merlin) at a wavelength 
of 620 nm. An optical density of > 0.1 was interpreted 
as an indication of growth. MICs were interpreted with 
the advanced expert system MCN-6 (Merlin) using the 
guidelines of the German Institute for Standardization 
(Deutsches Institut für Normung, Berlin, Germany). E. 
coli ATCC 25922, E. coli ATCC 35218 and K. pneumo-
niae ATCC 700603 were used as quality controls.

Vitek‑2 system
All  suspected  ESBL  isolates  were  subsequently  con-
firmed  using  an  automated  microdilution  system 
(VITEK-2, bioMérieux Deutschland GmbH, Nürtingen, 
Germany)  according  to  the  instructions  of  the  manu-
facturer.  For  this  study,  the  test  card  AST-N289  was 
used that included the following antibiotics: piperacil-
lin  (PIP),  piperacillin/tazobactam  (TZP),  cefotaxime 
(CTX), ceftazidime (CAZ), cefepime (FEB), aztreonam 
(ATM),  imipenem  (IMP),  meropenem  (MEM),  ami-
kacin  (AMK),  gentamicin  (GEN),  tobramycin  (TOP), 
ciprofloxacin  (CIP),  moxifloxacin  (MXF),  tigecycline 
(TGC), fosfomycin (FOS), colistin (CT) and trimetho-
prim/sulfamethoxazole (T/S).

Detection of antibiotic resistance and virulence‑associated 
genes of E. coli isolates by microarray analysis
Antimicrobial  resistance  (AMR)  genotypes  and  other 
resistance  genes  were  ascertained  using  the  CarbDe-
tect AS-2 Kit and E. coli PanType AS-2 Kit, respectively 
(Alere Technologies GmbH). The data were automatically 
summarized by the “result collector”, a software tool pro-
vided by Alere Technologies GmbH. An antibiotic resist-
ance genotype was assigned to be a carrier of a group of 

genes  which  have  been  described  to  confer  resistance 
to  a  family  of  antibiotics  (e.g.,  the  genotype  “blaCTX-
M1/15,  blaTEM”  conferring  resistance  to  3rd  generation 
cephalosporins).

The  detection  of  virulence-associated  genes  was  per-
formed using E. coli PanType AS-2 Kit (Alere Technolo-
gies  GmbH).  Twenty-eight  different  combinations  of 
genes  encoding  virulence  factors  associated  with  adhe-
sion,  fimbriae  production,  secretion  systems,  SPATE

(serine  protease  auto-transporters),  toxins  and  miscel-
laneous  genes  were  detected.  The  genes  were  detected 
and analysed by the “result collector”, a software tool pro-
vided by Alere Technologies GmbH.

Determination of colistin resistance
All identified E. coli isolates were tested for presence of 
plasmid-mediated mcr-1 gene using PCR [27]. Briefly, a 
PCR with 25 µL reaction mixture using CLR5-F (5′-CGG 
TCA  GTC  CGT  TTG  TTC-3′)  and  CLR5-R  (5′-CTT 
GGT CGG TCT GTA GGG-3′) was performed with the 
following  amplification  conditions:  initial  denaturing  at 
96 °C for 60 s was followed by 35 cycles of denaturing at 
96 °C for 15 s, annealing at 55 °C for 60 s and extension 
at 72 °C for 30 s. PCR was finished by final extension at 
72 °C for 60 s. Amplicons (308 bp) were analyzed on 1.5% 
agarose  gel,  stained  with  ethidium  bromide  and  visual-
ized under UV light.

For isolates possessing mcr-1 gene, MICs were deter-
mined  with  RUO  E-test  colistin  CO  256  according  to 
the  manufacturer’s  guidelines  (bioMérieux  Deutschland 
GmbH).  Briefly,  an  overnight  bacterial  suspension  in 
Mueller–Hinton  broth  was  adjusted  to  a  density  of 
McFarland 0.5 evenly streaked on Mueller–Hinton agar 
was  dry,  an  E-test®  colistin  strip  (concentration  range 
plates to ensure uniform growth. Once the agar surface 
from 0.016 to 256 μg/ml) was applied to the plate with 
sterile  forceps.  The  MIC  was  determined  after  aerobic 
incubation for 20 h at 37 °C as the point, where inhibition 
of bacterial growth intersected the E-test strip. Accord-
ing to clinical breakpoints given by EUCAST, an isolate 
was defined as resistant to colistin when the MIC value 
was > 2 µg/ml [48].

Results
Isolation and identification of Enterobacteriaceae
Out of 576 samples, 72 Enterobacteriaceae isolates were 
identified by MALDI-TOF MS. The isolates were classi-
fied as 63 E. coli (87.5%), 5 Enterobacter cloacae (6.9%), 
2 K. pneumoniae (2.8%) and 2 Citrobacter spp. (2.8%).

Seven  out  of  63  E.  coli  isolates  could  not  be  re-culti-
vated  for  testing  of  antibiotic  resistance  after  applying 
MALDI-TOF  MS  (11.1%),  while  DNA  was  extracted 
from preserving solution for further identification.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
The results of phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility testing 
of 56 re-cultivated E. coli isolates were given in Table 2. 
E. coli isolates showed high resistance rates to penicillin, 
erythromycin and rifampicin with 98.2, 96.4 and 96.4%, 
respectively.  Resistance  rates  to  other  tested  antibiotics 
were between 10.7% for amikacin and 64.3% for trimeth-
oprim/sulfamethoxazole. Only one E. coli isolate (1.8%) 

was resistant to imipenem (Tables 2 and 6). Fifty-five out 
of 56 E. coli isolates (98.2%) were resistant to antibiotics 
of at least three different classes of antimicrobial agents 
and thus they were defined as multidrug resistant isolates 
(Table 2).

The antimicrobial susceptibility profiles for other spe-
cies of Enterobacteriaceae were presented in Table 3. All 
5 Enterobacter cloacae isolates were resistant to penicil-
lin,  erythromycin  and  rifampicin.  Two  Citrobacter  spp. 
isolates  were  resistant  to  penicillin,  rifampicin,  strepto-
mycin and ceftazidime. Two K. pneumoniae strains were 
sensitive to amikacin and imipenem but resistant to the 
rest of the antibiotics tested.

Genoserotyping of E. coli isolates using microarray analysis
Three  out  of  63  E.  coli  isolates  (4.8%)  were  determined 
as O91 and O15; in all other cases O type determination 
failed.  H  antigen  types  were  identified  for  all  isolates. 
Seventeen different types of H antigens (H1, H2, H4, H5, 
H6, H7, H8, H10, H11, H16, H19, H21, H26, H28, H32, 
H34 and H51) were detected. H21 (14 isolates), H28 (10 
isolates) and H51 (8 isolates) are being the most common 
types.

Detection of antibiotic resistance determinants in E. coli 
by microarray analysis
Several resistance genes were identified in 15 phenotypi-
cally resistant E. coli using microarray analysis (Table 4). 
The  isolates  were  originated  from  four  districts  located 
in  four  provinces,  namely  Dakahliya  (n = 7),  Damietta 
(n = 3), Gharbiya (n = 3) and Kafr El-Sheikh (n = 4). Fre-
quently  identified  resistance  genes  were  aadA1  associ-
ated  with  resistance  to  aminoglycosides  (n = 12),  sul2 
responsible for sulphonamide resistance (n = 10) and floR 
connected with resistance to chloramphenicol (n = 10).
In this study, five E. coli isolates harboured qnrS gene 
while  one  isolate  possessed  qnrB  gene  associated  with 
quinolone  resistance.  In  two  phenotypically  ciprofloxa-
cin-resistant E. coli, qnrS gene was detected (Table 4).

The sul and dfrA genes associated with sulphonamides/
trimethoprim  resistance  were  detected  in  16  and  13  E. 
coli isolates, respectively (Table 4). Meanwhile, sul3 gene 
corresponding to sulphonamide resistance was amplified 
in two susceptible E. coli to sulphonamide/trimethoprim.
Eleven  E.  coli  phenotypically  resistant  to  tetracycline 
were harboured one or more tet genes (tetA, tetB or tetC) 
(Table  4).  Chloramphenicol  resistance-associated  genes 
catA1, catB3, cmlA1 and floR were detected in 13 E. coli 
isolates.  Out  of  13  chloramphenicol  resistant  isolates, 
10 isolates harboured one or more resistance genes. The 
cmlA1  gene  was  detected  once  in  an  E.  coli  strain  that 
was phenotypically susceptible to chloramphenicol.

Ten  different  genes  (aac6,  aac6Ib,  aadA1,  aadA2, 
aadA4, aadB, ant2, aphA, strA and strB) associated with 
aminoglycoside  resistance  were  detected  in  14  out  of 
phenotypically tested E. coli isolates (Table 4). All isolates 
harbouring at least one of described genes were pheno-
typically resistant to streptomycin, but four of them were 

susceptible to gentamicin (Tables 3, 4). All isolates with 
aminoglycoside resistance-associated genes were suscep-
tible to amikacin.

Genes  associated  with  macrolide  resistance  (ereA, 
mphA, mrx) were identified in 9 phenotypically resistant 
E.  coli  to  erythromycin.  The  rifampicin  resistance  gene 

Moawad et al. Gut Pathog  (2018) 10:39 

Page 7 of 12

arr  was  identified  in  only  2  phenotypically  rifampicin 
resistant isolates.

Fifteen out of 63 E. coli isolates (23.8%) harboured one 
or more ESBL, narrow-spectrum β-lactamase (NSBL) or 
AmpC β-lactamase genes. The gene blaTEM was found in 
13 DNAs of E. coli isolates (20.6%), blaCMY and blaOXA-7 
were  detected  in  2  samples  each  (3.2%)  and  blaSHV, 
blaOXA-1,  blaCTX-M1/15  and  blaDHA-1  were  found  in  one 
isolate (1.6%).

The correlation between the genotypic and phenotypic 
antimicrobial  resistance  of  E.  coli  was  demonstrated  in 
Table 4.

Thirteen out of 15 isolates harbouring bla genes were 
analyzed  using  the  VITEK-2  (Table  5).  Two  samples 
could  not  be  tested,  as  they  could  not  be  re-cultivated. 
All isolates possessing beta-lactam resistance genes were 
resistant to piperacillin, while one isolate was susceptible 
to moxifloxacin. All isolates were susceptible to fosfomy-
cin. The narrow-spectrum beta-lactamase gene blaOXA-1 
was detected once in one ESBL isolates originated from 
poultry farm in Damietta.

Genotypic and phenotypic identification of resistance 
to colistin
Plasmid-mediated  colistin  resistance  gene  mcr-1  was 
detected in 5 out of 63 E. coli (8.0%) using a PCR assay. 
All  of  them  were  phenotypically  confirmed  as  resistant 
to colistin using E-test (Table 6). All colistin resistant E. 
coli isolates were phenotypically resistant to rifampicin, 
penicillin and erythromycin but were susceptible to car-
bapenems. The colistin-resistant isolates originated from 
different  poultry  flocks  in  Dakahliya,  Kafr  El-Sheikh, 
Damietta and Gharbiya (Table 6).

Microarray analysis concerning virulence‑associated genes
The virulence genes detected by microarray were differ-
ently distributed all over the isolated E. coli. One isolate 
16CS0740 isolated from poultry farm in Dakahliya har-
boured 7 genes of virulence-associated secretion system: 
cif,  espA,  espF_O103H2,  espJ,  nleA,  nleB  O157:H7  and 
tccP.

eae  and  iha  genes,  involved  in  adhesion,  were  identi-
fied  in  16CS0740  and  16CS0752,  repectively.  Two  iso-
lates  harboured  serine  protease  autotransporter  genes. 
16CS0774  carried  tsh  while  16CS0775  had  pic  and  vat 
genes.

Several  toxin  genes  were  detected  in  13  E.  coli  iso-
lates  including  astA,  cma,  hlyE,  mchF,  sat  and  senB. 
Each of these isolates carried only one toxin gene except 
16CS0775 which harboured mchF, hlyE and cma. Nine-
teen out of 63 E. coli isolates (30.2%) harboured lpfA and 
3 others carried prfB fimbrae virulence gene. Miscellane-
ous genes encoding virulence factors as hemL, intI1, ireA, 
iroN, iss and tir genes were identified in 45 (71.4%), 10 
(15.9%), 3 (4.8%), 9 (14.3%), 36 (57.1%) and 1 (1.6%) of 63 
isolates, respectively.

The distribution of virulence-associated genes in E. coli 
isolates  possessed  antimicrobial  resistance-associated 
genes was demonstrated in Table 4.

Discussion
Escherichia coli is a commensal pathogen of the intesti-
nal tract of young and adult poultry [49]. Among healthy 
chickens,  10  to  15%  of  intestinal  coliform  bacteria  may 
belong to potentially pathogenic serotypes of E. coli [50].
The identification of bacterial foodborne pathogens of 
zoonotic  significance  using  rapid,  accurate  and  reliable

tools such as MALDI-TOF MS is mandatory for public 
health surveillance [44, 51].

In 2016, 576 cloacal swabs were collected from 48 poul-
try  farms  located  in  5  governorates  in  northern  Egypt. 
The samples were screened for multidrug resistant bac-
teria and investigated for the antimicrobial resistance of 
E. coli. Seven out of 56 E. coli isolates (12.5%) were pro-
ducing ESBLs. To analyze the underlying molecular anti-
microbial resistance mechanism, all E. coli isolates were 
genotyped using the multiplex microarray technique.

The results of this study were in accordance with previ-
ous reports which demonstrated a high prevalence of E. 
coli in poultry farms and their environment in Egypt [34, 
52–54].

In previous studies on broiler chickens in Egypt, high 
phenotypic  resistance  rates  were  found  to  penicillin, 
rifampicin, erythromycin, trimethoprim/sulphamethoxa-
zole,  streptomycin  and  tetracycline  [53].  Antimicrobial 
resistance rates in this study for amoxicillin (26.8%), gen-
tamicin  (19.6%)  and  imipenem  (1.8%)  were  lower  than 
those of E. coli isolates from poultry reported in Egypt 
[53], in China [55], in United States [56], in Korea [57], 
in United Kingdom [58], in Australia [59] and in Portu-
gal  [60].  In  the  present  investigation,  the  most  striking 
finding was that E. coli isolates showed a low resistance 
rate to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin (21.4%) and levo-
floxacin (14.3%)). Cephalosporins are the first-line anti-
microbials  for  treating  human  bacterial  infections  [61]. 
In addition, a considerable resistance to ceftazidime was 
detected  among  E.  coli  isolates  from  healthy  broilers 
(41.1%).

In  this  study,  one  carbapenem-resistant  isolate  (1.8%) 
was  found  within  all  E.  coli  isolates.  A  higher  rate  was 
determined  with  retail  chicken  meat,  11.3%  carbapene-
mase-producing  Enterobacteriaceae  including  E.  coli  in 
Egypt in a previous study [62].

Few  reports  discussed  prevalence  of  ESBL-producing 
E. coli isolated from healthy birds in Egypt. Here, ESBL 
and/or  AmpC  β-lactamase-producing 
isolates  were 
detected in seven out of tested 56 E. coli (12.5%) isolated 
from healthy broilers. Two ESBL-producing strains were 
isolated  from  one  farm  in  Gharbiya  governorate  (Farm 
4) while five other isolates could be recovered from dif-
ferent  farms  in  Dakahliya  and  Kafr  El-Sheikh  governo-
rates. Two of the ESBL-producing isolates 16CS0740 and 
16CS0747  from  Dakahliya  and  Gharbiya,  respectively 
were  additionally  carrying  blaOXA-7  gene  characteristic 
for β-lactamase-producing bacteria (Table 4).

In a previous study in 2017, only 6% ESBL-producing 
E.  coli  were  detected  in  colibacillosis  diseased  poultry 
in four different Egyptian governorates [63]. In contrast, 
ESBL/AmpC  β-lactamase-producing  E.  coli  were  found 
in all 50 investigated Dutch broiler farms [64]. In Sweden 

34.0%  of  broilers  carried  ESBL/AmpC  β-lactamase-
producing E. coli in their guts [65]. In Malaysia 48.8% of 
isolates  which  were  recovered  from  retail  poultry  meat 
markets were ESBL-AmpC positive [66].

The prevalence of ESBLs has been found to be variable 
worldwide with Asian countries having the highest rates 
[67].

In  this  study,  the  most  prevalent  resistance  gene  was 
blaTEM, which was identified in 85.7% of ESBL and AmpC 
β-lactamase-producing  isolates.  blaCMY-2  was  found  in 
2  of  ESBL  and  AmpC  β-lactamase-producing  isolates. 
blaOXA-7  was  found  in  2  of  ESBL  producing  isolates. 
While blaCTX-M9, blaCTX-M1-15, blaOXA-1, blaDHA-1, blaLAP-1 
and blaSHV were identified only in one ESBL-producing 
E. coli isolate.

The  resistance-associated  genes  blaTEM,  blaSHV,  and 
blaCMY  were  previously  reported  in  Enterobacteriaceae 
isolated from septicaemic broilers [68] and from humans 
[69, 70] in Egypt.

In  this  study,  blaTEM  resistance  gene  was  detected  in 
20.6%  of  E.  coli  isolates.  This  result  was  in  accordance 
with  previous  reports  in  China  [71,  72].  blaCMY  was 
detected in 3.5% of 56 E. coli isolates while the prevalence 
of blaCMY-2 amongst E. coli isolates from broilers in Japan 
was 69.5% [73]. In Belgium, 49.0% of ceftiofur-resistant 
E.  coli  isolates  derived  from  five  broiler  farms  carried 
blaCMY-2  [74].  Moreover,  12.1%  of  avian  pathogenic  E. 
coli strains and 9.5% of strains recovered from meat were 
found positive as carriers of blaCTX-M in Palestine [75].

qnrB and qnrS genes associated with quinolone resist-
ance were detected in one and five isolates, respectively, 
which is lower than described previously in E. coli iso-
lated from chickens in China [72, 76]. On the other hand, 
qnrA,  qnrB,  and  qnrS  genes  were  detected  in  0.75,  3.9 
and 5.1%, respectively of E. coli from chicken samples in 
China [77].

Many  studies  found  similarities  between  virulence-
associated  genes  in  human  and  avian  E.  coli  isolates 
including iss, fliC, iha and ireA genes [78].

In  a  previous  study,  the  virulence  genes  iroN,  ompT, 
iss, iutA, and hlyF were detected in 80.2% of isolated E. 
coli [68]. In this study, only 9 (16.7%) of the 56 E. coli iso-
lates carried 2 genes (iroN, iss) together characteristic for 
avian pathogenic E. coli.

The mcr-1 gene is now reported all over the world in 
Enterobacteriaceae from animals, food and humans [79]. 
In 2015, first time mcr-1 gene was detected in livestock 
and  raw  meat  samples  in  addition  to  human  beings  in 
China [27]. In this study, five E. coli isolates (8.9%) were 
phenotypically resistant to colistin and harboured mcr-1 
gene associated with colistin resistance. This result was 
higher than reported in E. coli isolates from pigs, poultry 
and turkey in France with 0.5, 1.8 and 5.9%, respectively

[80] and 5.6% of E. coli isolates from broilers in Germany 
[81], while it was lower than in E. coli isolates from poul-
try in China [27].

In  previous  studies  conducted  in  China  and  Austria, 
the  majority  of  phenotypically  colistin-resistant  E.  coli 
isolates carried the mcr-1 gene [82, 83].

Conclusion
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first report 
discussing the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of Entero-
bacteriaceae  and  ESBL-producing  E.  coli  isolated  from 
healthy  broilers  in  the  Nile  Delta  in  Egypt.  The  emer-
gence of colistin-resistant E. coli isolates in poultry is of 
public  health  significance  and  considered  as  potential 
source  of  transmission  of  plasmid-mediated  mcr-1  to 
humans.  It  was  shown  that  molecular  biological  meth-
ods such as microarray investigation are reliable and fast 
tools for detection of geno-serotypes, resistance- and vir-
ulence-associated determinants.

The results reinforce the need to develop surveillance 
strategies and to implement specific control procedures 
to  reduce  the  use  of  antibiotics  and  subsequently  the 
development of antimicrobial resistance by over-/misuse 
of antibiotic agents.
