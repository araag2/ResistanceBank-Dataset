Abstract
Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen that may cause severe infections in livestock, and represents the major cause
of mastitis in dairy cows. Currently, instead of using antibiotics, new strategies are sought to reduce this clinical health problem.
The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of phage therapy to kill S. aureus strains obtained from farms located at the
State of Guanajuato, México. Thirty-six S. aureus strains from cow milk with subclinical mastitis were isolated and identified,
and the susceptibility to antibiotics and four phages also isolated in this work was tested. It was found that more of 90% of S.
aureus isolates were not susceptible to six or more antibiotics, and 100% were resistant to penicillin, dicloxacillin, cefotaxime,
ampicillin and cephalothin, and 81 and 77%, to tetracycline and cefuroxime, respectively. Fortunately, 100% of S. aureus isolates
were susceptible to phages used in this work, which was detected as clear zones using specific phage. It was shown for the first
time, that phages used in this study are active against pathogenic S. aureus and might be incorporated into the therapy as an
important tool for the control of staphylococcal bovine mastitis, specially to antibiotic-resistant S. aureus strains isolated in farm
located at the state of Guanajuato, México; and its use might be extended to other regions inside or outside the country.

Introduction

Mastitis is the inflammation of the mammary gland caused by
pathogen agents. This disease is one of the largest production

concerns in the dairy industry worldwide (Halasa et al. 2007).
Mastitis can be caused by a plethora of pathogenic microor-
ganisms, where at least 137 agents are known to cause the
disease, such as Streptococcus agalactiae, Esherichia coli,

among others. However, staphylococci remain the main etio-
logical factor of bovine mastitis in many dairy herds (Sender
et al. 2017). Staphylococcus aureus is considered an agent
responsible for contagious intramammary infection (IMI) in
cattle, which is of major interest due to the low cure rate of S.
aureus infections by antibiotic treatment and its ability to per-
sist in a herd in the form of undetected, subclinical infections
(Sears and McCarthy 2003). Currently, the most common
method of treatment of bovine mastitis is the administration
of antibiotics. However, this kind of strategy has shown some
disadvantages including: low cure rate, increasing occurrence
of resistance, and the presence of antibiotics residues in the
milk (Gomes and Henriques 2016). Another problem of hu-
manity faces is the rapid increase of antibiotic resistance seen
amongst pathogenic microorganisms (Michael et al. 2014),
which is increased by the marked reduction in the develop-
ment of novel antibiotics (Norrby et al. 2005).

The necessity of identifying novel methods to combat in-
fections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria is increasing
each year. In this sense, bacteriophage represent an excellent
alternative to attack multi-resistant bacteria. Bacteriophages
(phages) are viruses able to specifically infect and kill the host
bacterial species (Haq et al. 2012). They coevolve with their
hosts optimizing its spread and release mechanisms from the
bacterial cell to the environment and cause (in the case of lytic
bacteriophages) lysis of the bacteria. They are also a major
driving force in S. aureus evolution as a pathogen since many
virulence genes are mobilized between different strains by
means of transduction (Xia and Wolz 2014). In this work,
the objective was to determine for the first time, the efficacy
of phage therapy to kill S. aureus strains obtained from farms
located at the State of Guanajuato, México. This study dem-
onstrated that 100% of antibiotic resistant S. aureus isolates
were susceptible to phages used in this work.

Material and methods

Study area and herds

The study was carried out in three municipalities from the
State of Guanajuato, Mexico: Apaseo El Grande, Huanimaro
and Silao, located in the central region of Mexico.
Geographically, there are three climatic zones defined in
Guanajuato with a pleasant climate with temperatures ranging
from 11.7 to 24.2 °C, an average altitude of 2015 m above sea
level, and annual average rainfall of 635 mm. Guanajuato is
located at west longitude 99°40′–102°6′ and north latitude
21°51′–19°55′. Three small commercial dairy herds were in-
cluded in this study, which were selected for convenience
based on the readiness to participate in the research and the
existence of productive and reproductive data at the sampling
time. The livestock facilities, nutritional system and practical

Vet Res Commun

management of cows, including milking, was similar among
of them, and were classified as intensive production dairy
herds, according to Villamar and Olivera (2005). Most herds
were Holstein-Friesian breed type with different herd sizes.

Animals and milk sampling

Foremilk samples were collected for California Mastitis Test
(CMT) scoring, evaluation of the milk appearance in all lac-
tation cows, including a total of 454 animals, following the
method described by Schalm and Noorlander (1957). To de-
termine local signs of mastitis, milk color and consistency
were assessed as normal or changed (flakes, clots and
discoloration).

Somatic cell count and bacteriological analysis

The somatic cell count (SCC) of the milk was measured using
a DeLaval cell counter DCC™ (DeLaval, Sweden) as de-
scribed by Kawai et al. (2013). Once quarter by subclinical
mastitis has been identified, teat was disinfected with swabs
soaked in 70% (v/v) ethyl alcohol. Then, 10–15 mL milk
samples were collected in sterile caped tubes and numbered,
according to standard procedures by the National Mastitis
Council (Hogan et al. 1999). Samples were immediately
transported to the Microbiology laboratory under cold chain.
Sixty milk samples from udder quarters affected by SCM
were sent to microbiological analysis. Milk samples were se-
−3) with PBS buffer (137 mM NaCl,
rially diluted (10
10 mM Na2HPO4, 2.7 mM KCl and 1.8 mM KH2PO4,
pH 7.2). For isolation of S. aureus, diluted samples were in-
oculated in Staph 110 (Merck™, Darmstadt, Germany) and
incubated at 37 °C for 72 h in aerobic conditions. Culture
plates that showed three or more different colonies, were
discarded and registered as contaminated sample (Hogan et
al. 1999). Preliminary selection of bacterial strains was carried
out using colony morphology, color, and Gram stain; after
that, isolates were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth at
37 °C for 72 h, and stocks were prepared in LB broth with
20% (v/v) glycerol. Bacterial stocks were stored at −80 °C and
used for further experiments.

Microbial molecular typing

Extraction of genomic DNA was carried out by picking one
colony from fresh culture plate by using the PowerSoil®
DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories Inc., Carlsbad, CA,
USA). The 16S rDNA was amplified by colony-PCR using 10
pM of the universal oligonucleotide set that amplifies both
bacterial domains: forward UBF 5’-AGAGTTTGATCCTG
GCTGAG-3′ and reverse 1492 R5´-GGTTACCTTGTTAC
GACTT-3′. For the amplification of 16S rDNA a proof fidelity
enzyme (BioRad) was used under the following conditions:

5 min at 95 °C; 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, and 1:
30 min at 72 °C; and finally, 5 min at 72 °C. An aliquot of 5
µL of amplicons was subjected to electrophoresis in 1% aga-
rose gels and stained with ethidium bromide to visualize the
amplified products.

Antibiotic susceptibility testing

Isolates were suspended in 5 mL LB broth at 37 °C to achieve
an absorbance at 600 nm of ~ a 0.5 based on McFarland
standard. Bacterial cultures were distributed uniformly on
Mueller-Hinton agar (Difco, BD, Sparks, MD) by using sterile
swabs, and susceptibilities to an assortment of antibiotics were
determined by standard disk-diffusion assays for Gram-
positive bacteria (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Zones of
inhibition (in mm) were recorded after ∼18 h of incubation
at 35–37 °C. The zones of inhibition were determined and
compared with the standards of performance of the supplier
to determine whether the tested strain was sensitive (S), inter-
mediate (I), or resistant (R). Twelve antibiotics were used to
test Gram-positive bacteria: Penicillin (PE), dicloxacillin
(DC), pefloxacin (PEF), cefuroxime (CXM), gentamicin
(GE), cefotaxime (CTX); sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim
(SXT), tetracycline (TE), ampicillin (AM), erythromycin
(E), ceftazidime (CAZ), and cephalothin (CF).

Bacteriophage isolation and propagation

The isolation of bacteriophage was performed as described
previously by Kutter and Sulakvelidze (Kutter and
Sulakvelidze 2005) using apathogenic S. aureus strain. Two
milk samples and udder skin scraping sterile cotton swab from
diagnosed cows with clinical mastitis were obtained and cen-
trifuged in a bench-top centrifuge at 10,000 g for 10 min to
4 °C. The supernatant was filter-sterilized (0.22 μm pore di-
ameter) and stored at 4 °C. The filtered supernatant was added
in the 5 mL of LB broth with S. aureus apathogenic strain
exponential middle phase and the samples were incubated to
37 °C to 120 rpm. After 18 h, samples were centrifugated to
3000 rpm for 10 min to eliminated residues of bacterial. Five
chloroform drops were added to the supernatant and main-
tained at 4 °C.

To confirm the presence of phages and evaluated their
lytic mechanism, the Spot Test method was carried out as
described by Wommack et al. (2009). In brief, 100 μL of
S. aureus apathogenic strain broth in the final exponential
phase was subjected to plaque by extension in the LB
solid agar. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h,
and the lytic activities were registered by mean display
of clear zone of inhibition. Four isolated strains of bacte-
riophages were obtained, and their identification was
done. Phages with the widest inhibition zone (lytic activ-
ity) were selected to perform in vitro assays.

Bacteriophage susceptibility analysis

The phage range activity was determined by the the spot test
method (Armon and Kott 1993) against the tweeny-seven dif-
ferent isolates of S. aureus obtained in this work. The exper-
imental groups were performed according to the three-
different grade of purification of S. aureus phage lysate solu-
tions in order to obtain the best purification procedure. Process
1, low purification level (lysate 1); process 2, medium purifi-
cation level (lysate 2); process 3, high purification level (lysate
3). The experimental groups were performed using the three-
different grade of purification of S. aureus phage lysate solu-
tions and according to the factors that influence the phage
efficiency in the udder: excipient (physiological saline solu-
tion, PBS and propylene glycol), phage concentration (0.3, 0.5
and 0.8 mL) and pH (5, 7 and 8). Soft agar (3–5 mL) with
100 μL of an overnight bacterial culture and equal volume of
CaCl2 (300 mM) were gently vortexed and spread on the
surface of hard agar. Single drops of each phage lysate were
spotted on the inoculated hard agar plates, and plates were
incubated overnight at 30 °C (Wommack et al. 2009).
Bacterial sensitivity was judged visually by spot clarity; clear
(+) or no reaction (−). Assays were repeated in triplicate.

Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed with and analysis of variance (ANOVA)
with a completely random factorial design. The model includ-
ed four factors: lysate (three purified level phage), vehicle
(three levels: saline solution, PBS and propylene glycol),
phage concentration (three levels: 0.3, 0.5 and 0.8 mL) and
pH (three levels: 5, 7 and 8); test was carried out in triplicated.
Hence, the database was integrated for a total of 243 data (3
lysates × 3 excipient × 3 concentrations × 3 pH’s × 3 replica-
tions). In this model the first order interactions were evaluated,
and the means comparison was done with the Tukey method
(P < 0.05). Data were analyzed with the Statgraphics
Centurion Program v.16.1.

Results and discussion

Bacterial isolates

Using preliminary bacterial
identification protocols, such
as colony morphology, color, and Gram stain, it was ob-
tained thirty-six putative S. aureus isolates (60%). Based
on 16 s rDNA sequences, it was confirmed that isolates
were S. aureus. These strains were catalase positive, and
displayed response of mannitol sensitivity and β-hemolysis
tests (24%).

Similar result was mentioned by Salgado-Ruiz et al.
(2015), which carry out a study in small farms in the highlands

of Central Mexico and they found between 52 to 66% of milk
samples were positive for S. aureus. Several reports have
shown that this bacterium is an important pathogen responsi-
ble for contagious intramammary infections (IMI) in cattle
worldwide (Sears and McCarthy 2003), and remains as a mi-
croorganism of central interest for the dairy industry and vet-
erinary medicine in the herds.

Antibiotic susceptibility patterns

All tested isolates exhibited a perceptible degree of resistance
to antibiotics. Tweenty four S. aureus isolated of this study
(66.6%) showed resistance from six to nine antimicrobial
agents, mostly to penicillin, dicloxacillin, cefotaxime, ampi-
cillin and cephalothin while resistance to ten or more antimi-
crobial agents was found in 12 isolates (33.3%). Only some S.
aureus strains showed a low susceptibility (44–58%) to
gentamycin, pefloxacin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and
erythromycin. Special consideration showed S. aureus isolat-
ed that were detected with intermediate susceptibility in a
range of 10 to 32% (Table 1). The microorganisms were main-
ly resistant to penicillin, dicloxacillin, cefotaxime, ampicillin
and cephalothin (100%), while they showed resistance to tet-
racycline and cefuroxime in 81 and 77%, respectively.

The antimicrobial resistance level in this study was serious-
ly high. In the present study, the highest rates of antimicrobial
resistance were against to all β-lactam antibiotic group
(Fig. 1), which are the most widely used antimicrobials in
the treatment of bovine mastitis. Similar results were obtained
by Zhang and Buckling (2012) who indicated that 94.8% of
the S. aureus isolates were resistant to at least one antimicro-
bial agent, particularly ampicillin and penicillin. León-Galván
et al. (2015) and Barboza-Corona et al. (2009) found that 60 to
90% of microorganisms isolated from clinical and subclinical
bovine mastitis, were resistant to β-lactam antibiotics.
According to Jensen and Lyon (2009) S. aureus resistance to
multiple antimicrobial agents is driven by the acquisition of
mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, transposable genet-
ic elements (insertion sequences and transposons). These ge-
netic elements incorporate preformed antimicrobial resistance
determinants and are exchanged between bacterial strains/
species via horizontal gene transfer. Since 1940’s it was dem-
onstrated the original penicillin-resistant strains through ac-
tion of β-lactamase, which hydrolyzed β-lactam ring of this
antibiotic class. Today, is known that the β-lactamase struc-
tural gene (blaZ) is present on Tn552-like transposons or rem-
nants thereof. These elements are commonly carried by β-
lactamase/heavy-metal resistance plasmids. Chromosomal-
mediated resistance could result from integration of plasmids
carrying Tn552-like elements or from only insertion of these
elements (Jensen and Lyon 2009).

In Mexico, it is very common that, at the end of period of
lactation in dairy cattle, farmers use a prophylactic dose of

Vet Res Commun

antibiotics (i.e., penicillin and cephalosporins) into the udder
(León-Galván et al. 2015). Although the use of antibiotics to
prevent mastitis is a common practice, it is obvious that this
procedure might generate penicillin-resistant microorganisms
(Rushton et al. 2014). Furthermore, uncontrolled use of anti-
biotics for therapeutic and nutritive purposes has brought
about the emergence of pathogenic bacteria resistant to most
of currently available antimicrobial agents (Brnakova and
Godany 2005). Antibiotic resistance in S. aureus is also a
growing concern, with the overall rates of antimicrobial resis-
tance in bovine S. aureus isolates varying widely by region
(Makovec and Ruegg 2003; Pitkala et al. 2004; Sabour et al.
2004). The main explanation of this is because the treatment
of Staphylococcus infections, which is largely based on anti-
biotics, bacteria are increasingly acquiring resistance to com-
monly used drugs (Zhang et al. 2016). More than a decade
ago, the Center of Disease Control (CDC) (2008) reported that
approximately 95% of hospital staphylococcal (‘staph’) infec-
tions failed to respond to first-line antibiotics. The need for a
better knowledge about encoded bacterial resistance systems,
their prevalence and genetic variation, and establishment of
collections of bacteria containing as large part of this variation
it is very important (Khan and Nilsson 2015). Therefore, this
suggests that genetic background and their susceptibility pat-
tern may be considered for the design of modern strategies to
control of S. aureus infections in the dairy farms (Barrera-
Rivas et al. 2017).

Bacteriophage susceptibility

The effect of phage infection on isolates obtained in this study
was observed in the 100% of S. aureus samples by mean
display of clear zone of inhibition. It was showed a global
mean of 17.5 mm of inhibition diameter (Table 2). The lytic
activity of bacteriophages solution seems like more suitable
used in this study showed a variable range of inhibition diam-
eter from 10.4 to 23.3 mm according to different factor and
levels evaluated, however all of them registered significant
differences (p < 0.01) (Table 2). It is necessary to emphasize
that the solution that registered the widest inhibition halo
(23.3 mm) was phage prepared solution corresponding to the
highest grade of purification (lysate solution No. 3, propylene
glycol excipient 3, high concentration (0.8 mL), and alkaline
pH (8.0) (p < 0.000). The development of clear zones of lysis
against S. aureus using specific phage lysate, clearly indicated
that the phage was lytic. These in vitro results indicated that
the use of bacteriophage to control S. aureus could be an
alternative for bovine subclinical mastitis cases, which should
be tested in further studies.

One of the alternative approaches of how eliminate patho-
gens from the mammary gland is the use of bacteriophages
(Brnakova and Godany 2005). Several studies carried out in in
vitro, murine and in vivo or clinical assays have been

demonstrated important results by means the high efficacy of
the bacteriophages on S. aureus isolated from bovine mastitis
(Capparelli et al. 2007; Kwiatek et al. 2012; Schmelcher et al.
2012; Mishra et al. 2013; Hamza et al. 2016; Becker et al.
2016; Fan et al. 2016). Similar results were obtained for staph-
ylococcal isolates from bovine mastitis and human’s hand
samples with high frequency of antibiotic resistance obtained
from small farms in the highlands of Central Mexico, which

were tested against members of two phage families
[Siphoviridae (phi11, phiIPLA88 and phiIPLA35) and
Myoviridae (phiIPLA-RODI and phiIPLA-C1C)]. The in
vitro effectivity of bacteriophage to infect and lyse the S.
aureus isolates, showed and important percentage of efficacy
of inhibition growth of S. aureus isolated; however, it was
mentioned a phage-resistance event from two S. aureus
human’s hand isolates (Salgado-Ruiz et al. 2015).

Zoonotic transfer of pathogenic bacteria, either through
direct contact or via the food chain, represents a serious threat
to public health (Boss et al. 2015), which is also particularly
true for zoonotic pathogens such as S. aureus that may infect
humans (Chroboczek et al. 2013) or that display resistance to
antimicrobials used in humans (Garcia-Alvarez et al. 2011;
Leverstein-van Hall et al. 2011). The treatment of bacterial
infections could benefit from our extensive knowledge of
the genetics and evolution of antibiotic resistance, coupled
with a promising alternative therapeutic agent that could act
as a powerful enhancer (Torres-Barceló and Hochberg 2016).

Conclusion

The pathological role of S. aureus in bovine mastitis has in-
creased inevitably and there is an urgent need to highlight the
threat to both animal and human health. However, the in vitro
susceptibility of S. aureus isolated from subclinical mastitis
cases to phage infection was of 100% of efficacy in this study.
Alternative approaches based on bacteriophages has proved to
be useful as potential tool to eliminate the pathogen from
cattle, particularly, the several problems associated with the
control of bovine mastitis using phage therapy and can

represent an alternative to conventional antibiotic control of
multi-resistance bacterial infections. Our in vitro studies
showed encouraging results but more tests, namely in vivo,
are still critical and this is probably a result of the shortage of
more in-depth research.
