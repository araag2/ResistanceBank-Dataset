SUMMARY

We investigated the prevalence, diversity, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) proﬁles of non-typhoidal
Salmonella (NTS) and associated risk factors on 341 pig, chicken, and duck farms in Dong Thap
province (Mekong Delta, Vietnam). Sampling was stratiﬁed by species, district (four categories), and
farm size (three categories). Pooled faeces, collected using boot swabs, were tested using ISO 6575: 2002
(Annex D). Isolates were serogrouped; group B isolates were tested by polymerase chain reaction to
detect S. Typhimurium and (monophasic) serovar 4,[5],12:i:- variants. The farm-level adjusted NTS
prevalence was 64·7%, 94·3% and 91·3% for chicken, duck and pig farms, respectively. Factors
independently associated with NTS were duck farms [odds ratio (OR) 21·2], farm with >50 pigs (OR
11·9), pig farm with 5–50 pigs (OR 4·88) (vs. chickens), and frequent rodent sightings (OR 2·3). Both S.
Typhimurium and monophasic S. Typhimurium were more common in duck farms. Isolates had
a high prevalence of resistance (77·6%) against tetracycline, moderate resistance (20–30%) against
chloramphenicol, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, ampicillin and nalidixic acid, and low resistance
(<5%) against ciproﬂoxacin and third-generation cephalosporins. Multidrug resistance (resistance
against 53 classes of antimicrobial) was independently associated with monophasic S. Typhimurium
and other group B isolates (excluding S. Typhimurium) and pig farms. The unusually high prevalence
of NTS on Mekong Delta farms poses formidable challenges for control.

subspecies I other than those that typically cause in-
vasive disease in non-immunocompromised humans
(i.e. S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A). The majority of
NTS infections do not result in clinical disease in ani-
mals. However, they are considered to be zoonotic
and to have pathogenic potential in humans, typically
causing self-limiting gastroenteritis [1]. In Vietnam
NTS are responsible for up to 7% of cases of diarrhoea

in children [2]. In addition, invasive infections due to
NTS have become increasingly reported in Vietnam
while infections due to S. Typhi are declining [3].

Due to economic and diagnostic limitations, full sero-
typing of NTS involved in disease in humans is not routi-
nely performed in Vietnam, with most data on NTS
serovar distribution originating from ad hoc research stu-
dies. For example, a study of 1419 paediatric cases of di-
arrhoea in 2009–2010 identiﬁed group B NTS in 58% of
77 identiﬁed NTS cases [4]. A previous study of 54 cases
from ﬁve provincial hospitals
in 2004 identiﬁed
S. Typhimurium [phage type (PT) 90] as the most
common serovar. The same study also identiﬁed
S. Typhimurium PT90 as the second most common
serovar in pigs after S. Anatum [5]. Monophasic
S. Typhimurium (mST) variants (i.e. serovar 4,[5],12:i:-)
lacking the ﬁrst or the second phase H antigen due
to a genetic deletion have been emerging since the
1990s worldwide, and are often associated with an in-
crease in multidrug resistance (MDR) [6] but have not
yet been reported in Vietnam.

A number of studies have investigated the presence
in Vietnam [7–12].
of NTS in meat/carcasses
However, to our knowledge, the farm-level prevalence
of NTS and associated risk factors have not yet been
systematically investigated in Vietnam; both of
which are prerequisites for the development of control
measures on farms.

We performed a survey on NTS in 341 pig and
poultry farms in the Mekong Delta region of southern
Vietnam using environmental faecal sampling meth-
ods. The aims of the study were: (1) to determine
the prevalence and main serogroups of Salmonella,
S. Typhimurium and mST in the main farmed species;
(2) to describe antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pat-
terns in NTS isolates; and (3) to investigate farm-level
risk factors for NTS, S. Typhimurium, mST and
MDR NTS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Survey design and data collection

The survey was conducted between February and
May 2012 in Dong Thap (Vietnam), a Mekong
Delta province characterized by high density of
small-scale pig and chicken farms, as well as large
numbers of duck ﬂocks typically reared in synchroni-
city with the rice production cycle. The study covered
4/12 districts, three species (chicken, ducks, pigs) and
three farm size categories. Farms were randomly

selected from the district farm population census as
previously described [13]. When a farmer refused par-
ticipation, his farm was replaced by the next available
one. Questionnaires (available upon request) were
used to obtain basic farm demographics as well as
other parameters related to the farmer and the farm
management. Demographic statistical data pertaining
to the commune (density of humans, pigs and poultry)
were obtained from the Vietnamese Government
Statistical Ofﬁce (GSO).

Sampling methods

We performed environmental sampling using swabs to
collect naturally pooled faeces [14–16]. A ﬁxed num-
ber of boot swabs were collected from small (n = 3),
medium (n = 4) and large (n = 5) farms. This sampling
scheme was formulated as a compromise between sen-
sitivity, simplicity and the requirement for standardi-
zation. Since one pair of boot swabs is roughly
equivalent to sampling 60 individual faecal droppings
[17], we assumed that our sampling method was
equivalent to sampling a constant proportion of ani-
mals from each farm. Brieﬂy, areas dedicated to hous-
ing the farms’ target species were divided into equally
sized sections. From each section a pair of boot swabs
was taken by walking over 50 steps with a shufﬂing
motion focused on areas where fresh droppings were
visible. Where walking on housing areas was not poss-
ible (i.e. sows in crates/farrowing pens, chickens in
cages or
swabs
were used to sample faeces from 10 sampling points
(∼25 g per swab). Recent studies have shown that
three pairs of boot swabs used per ﬂock are equivalent
to sampling methods used in the European Union
NTS surveys [18].

Laboratory methods

Samples were immediately sent
to the laboratory
under refrigeration (4–8 °C). Cultures were initiated
within 12 h of collection. The testing method was a
modiﬁed version of ISO 6579:2002 (Annex D), involv-
ing: (a) pre-enrichment in buffered peptone water
(BPW) (37 °C, 18 h); (b) plating on modiﬁed semi-
solid Rappaport–Vassiliadis (MSRV) (41 °C, 24 h)
and (c) plating onto Rambach agar (37 °C, 24 h)
[19]. Suspect NTS colonies were conﬁrmed by sero-
grouping based on the Kauffmann–White typing
scheme using relevant poly O antiserum [20].

Only one colony was randomly selected from each
swab sample. Isolates were classiﬁed as either group B,
C, D, or ‘other’ NTS. Conﬁrmed NTS group B isolates
were further tested by reverse transcriptase–polymerase
chain reaction (RT–PCR) for S. Typhimurium and
mST (serovar 4,[5],12:i:-) by conventional PCR [21].
All isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility
against 10 antimicrobials belonging to seven classes
using the Kirby–Bauer (disk diffusion) method on
Muller–Hinton Agar (Oxoid, UK). The antimicrobials
and concentrations were as follows: (1) penicillins (with
and without clavulanic acid): ampicillin (AMP, 10 μg)
and amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (AUG, 30 μg);
(2) third-generation cephalosporins: ceftriaxone (CRO,
30 μg), and ceftazidime (CAZ, 30 μg); (3) phenicols:
chloramphenicol (30 μg); (4) quinolones: nalidixic acid
(NA, 30 μg) and ciproﬂoxacin (CIP, 5 μg); (5) aminogly-
cosides: gentamicin (CN, 10 μg); (6) potentiated sulph-
onamides: sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SXT); (7)
tetracyclines: tetracycline (TE, 30 μg). Results were inter-
preted according to breakpoints as deﬁned by the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines for Enterobacteriaceae [22].

Isolates were assigned to a serovar by multilocus se-
quence typing (MLST) on DNA extracted using the
Wizard Genomic DNA extraction kit (Promega, USA)
from one full loop of pure NTS colonies of overnight
culture in nutrient agar media. PCR ampliﬁcation was
performed on the seven MLST loci aroC, dnaN, hemD,
hisD, purE, sucA and thrA, as described previously
[22]. PCR products were puriﬁed using QIAquick
column-based PCR puriﬁcation system (Qiagen, USA)
and sequenced in forward and reverse directions using
the Big Dye Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems,
USA) on an ABI 3770 automatic sequencer according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. After generating a se-
quence type, strains were inferred to serotypes according
to the data available on the MLST database (http://mlst.
warwick.ac.uk/mlst/dbs/Senterica/).

Due to economic limitations, we performed selective
MLST-based serovar identiﬁcation on one isolate repre-
senting each phenotypic pattern, deﬁned by the combi-
nation of
(a) serovar/serogroup (S. Typhimurium,
mST, other group B, group C, group D, and ‘other
group’); and (b) sensitivity results for 10 antimicrobials.
The tested isolate was chosen at random.

Statistical analyses

Data from all farms were combined into a unique
dataset aiming to model the overall probability of a

swab testing positive for NTS. Since the number of
farms in each stratum (i = 1,
. . ., 36) was known
from census data, prevalence estimates and odds
ratio (OR) estimates, regression models were adjusted
by assigning a stratum-speciﬁc sampling weight (Wi)
to each observation unit (swab):
Wi = NT
Ni

,

where NT is the total number of farms ( 35 248) and Ni is
the number of farms sampled in each stratum. Standard
errors were corrected to take into account potential
similarities between farms in each stratum [23]. The
prevalence of a positive boot swab per farm was com-
pared for each species. Risk factor analyses at swab
level were performed using hierarchical
logistic re-
gression with ‘farm’ as the clustering variable for the
following outcomes: (1) prevalence of NTS; (2) preva-
lence of S. Typhimurium-positive results (vs. any
other result, including negative); and (3) prevalence of
mST result (vs. any other result, including negative).

combination

Each NTS isolate was characterized by a proﬁle
deﬁned
type
(S. Typhimurium, mST, other group B, group C,
group D, other group) and its susceptibility/resistance
against the 10 antimicrobials tested. Shannon–Weaver
entropy (H) was used to estimate the farm-level diver-
sity of isolates from the same farm. H was deﬁned as:

H = − (cid:1)R
i=1

pi ln pi,

where pi is the proportion of isolates with the ith resist-
ance proﬁle, and R is the total number of proﬁles.
Higher values of H correspond to greater diversity
in AMR proﬁles.

The prevalence of AMR against all antimicrobials
tested (and their corresponding 95% conﬁdence inter-
vals; CI) was calculated for S. Typhimurium, mST
and other group B serovars, groups C, and D, and
other group serovars separately. Hierarchical logistic
regression models with the variable ‘farm’ as a ran-
dom effect were built using data on all NTS isolates
to investigate the outcome of ‘probability of a multi-
drug resistant (MDR) strain’, deﬁned as resistance
against 53 classes of antimicrobials. Variables inves-
tigated in all models were: (1) type of farm, deﬁned by
the target species and size (nine categories); (2) age,
gender and years of experience of the farmer; (3) use
of antimicrobials on the farm over the last 3 months;
(4) use of any Salmonella vaccines on target species on
farm;

pigs as ‘non-target species’; (7) presence of cattle/buf-
falo/dog/cat; (8) type of water (well, municipal); and
(9) frequency of rodent and wild bird sightings. In
all models candidate variables were those signiﬁcant
(<0.05) in the univariable models for any of the
three outcomes. Variables were ranked by their degree
of signiﬁcance and were included in the model starting
with the most signiﬁcant ones using a step-wise for-
ward approach [24]. In each of the ﬁnal multivariable
models, variables were retained if their P value was
<0·05 for any of the outcome variables. All interac-
tions between signiﬁcant variables in the model were
assessed. The suitability of each new variable included
in the model was assessed using the Wald test [23]. All
interactions between ﬁnal signiﬁcant variables were
tested. All statistical analyses were performed using
R packages
(http://www.
r-project.org).

‘survey’ and ‘epicalc’

chicken farms (64·7%, 95% CI 49·4–80·0). Chicken
farms had a signiﬁcantly lower NTS prevalence than
both duck and pig farms (P < 0·05). There were no stat-
istically signiﬁcant differences in prevalence by district
for any of the three species (data not shown).

S. Typhimurium was most commonly isolated from
duck farms (19·6%) and least from pig farms (2·7%).
mST was most commonly isolated from duck farms
(13·5%). The farm-level prevalence of NTS belonging
to groups other than B, C, or D was 62·4% (pig farms),
42·8% (duck farms), and 37·3% (chickens farms).

Sample-level prevalence

At the sample (swab) level, the highest prevalence of
NTS corresponded to samples from duck farms
(69·8%, 95% CI 61·2–76·3), followed by pig (65·4%,
95% CI 59·0–71·9) and chicken (31·0%, 95% CI
22·3–39·3) farms (Fig. 2).

RESULTS

The total number of farms in the sampling frame as well
as the actual number of farms sampled (sampling units)
and their associated sampling weights are shown in
Supplementary Table S1. A total of 341 farms were
sampled (117 chicken, 118 duck, 104 pig farms) using a
total of 1349 swabs, and 739 NTS isolates were recov-
ered. Since small chicken farms were by far the predomi-
nant farm category (66·2% of all farms), swabs from
these farms were assigned the largest sampling weight.

Diversity of NTS proﬁles by farm type

Of farms with at least two NTS isolates, the overall H
was greatest for pig farms [median 0·69, interquartile
range (IQR) 0·56–1·1], followed by duck (median
0·69, IQR 0·56–1·0) and chicken (median 0·61, IQR
0–0·69) farms, although the difference between differ-
ent species was not statistically signiﬁcant (Kruskal–
Wallis χ2 = 3·44, P = 0·178). Of all farm types, large
duck farms had the greatest diversity of proﬁles
(H = 0·74, IQR 0·69–1·1).

Farm-level prevalence

Risk factors for NTS, S. Typhimurium and mST

The crude farm-level prevalence by species is shown in
Table 1. The overall survey adjusted farm-level preva-
lence of NTS was 73·0% (95% CI 62·0–84·0) (Fig. 1).
The highest survey-adjusted NTS prevalence corre-
sponded to duck farms (94·3%, 95% CI 88·3–100·0), fol-
lowed by pig farms (91·3%, 95% CI 83·1–99·5) and

The nine farm-type categories were combined into
four groups, (a) chicken farms (baseline); (b) duck
farms; (c) small pig farms; and (d) medium and
large pig farms, given the observed statistically signiﬁ-
cant differences in risk between (b), (c), and (d) and
baseline. Swabs from duck farms were associated

with a higher prevalence of NTS compared to chicken
swabs (OR 21·2). Compared to chicken farms, pig
farms had an increased risk, although the magnitude
of risk was higher for large farms (OR 11·9, compared
to OR 4·9 for smaller pig farms). Other factors asso-
ciated with NTS were ‘rodents seen at least weekly’
(OR 2·3), and male farmer (OR 2·5). The interaction
between ‘high frequency of rodent sightings’ and
farm type indicated an additional increase in risk for
small pig farms, large pig farms and chicken farms
with high frequency of rodent sightings (OR 8·8,
21·3, and 1·8, respectively) (compared to chicken
farms with low frequency of rodent sightings). By con-
trast, duck farms with a high frequency of rodent
sightings had no increased risk (vs. duck farms with
low frequency of rodent sightings) (OR 0·79, P = 0·26).
Of the three species, ducks had the greatest preva-
lence of S. Typhimurium, although it was only signiﬁ-
cantly greater compared to pigs (but not chickens).
The human density at commune level was a strong
protective factor for S. Typhimurium (log number of
humans/km2, OR 0·5).

Duck ﬂocks had a greater probability of testing
positive with mST compared to chickens or pigs
(OR 6·8), as did farms located in areas of high density
of pig farms (OR 1·6). By contrast, supplying animals
with municipal water was a strong protective factor
(OR 0·1) for all species (Table 2).

A total of 97/103 pig farmers reported that they had
vaccinated their herds against Salmonella over the pre-
vious year, using both inactivated and attenuated pre-
parations
containing S. Cholerasuis and/or S.
Typhimurium strains. There was no difference in
prevalence between vaccinated and unvaccinated
herds (data not shown). None of the chicken and
duck farms reported using Salmonella vaccines.

Antimicrobial resistance

A total of 727/739 (98·4%) NTS isolates
(50
S. Typhimurium, 45 mST, 168 other group B, 101
group C, 53 group D, 310 ‘other’ groups) were tested
for AMR. The highest observed levels of resistance
were against tetracyclines (77·6%) chloramphenicol
(27·2%),
sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (27·0%),
ampicillin (24·2%), and nalidixic acid (22·8%). The
proportion of strains resistant against ciproﬂoxacin
was 1·3%. The proportion of MDR isolates (resistant
to 53 classes of antimicrobials) was 30·1%. The pro-
portion of MDR was greatest for group B serovars
other than S. Typhimurium and mST (42·8%), fol-
lowed by mST (37·8%), and S. Typhimurium
(22·0%). MDR was lowest for groups C and D NTS
(11·9% and 9·4%, respectively) (Table 3). Compared
to poultry NTS isolates, pig isolates had higher levels
of AMR against tetracycline (83·3% vs. 68·1–77·6%),

ampicillin (41·3% vs. 14·3–19·4%), chloramphenicol
(41·3% vs. 20·1–20·4%), gentamicin (7·5% vs. 2·6–
4·2%) and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (36·7%
vs. 14·6–25·4%). NTS isolates resistant
to third-
generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone and/or ceftazi-
dime) were identiﬁed in all
three animal species,
although at low numbers (<1%) (data not shown).

Risk factors for MDR

MDR was associated with pig farms (vs. other species)
(OR 4·5) and with mST (OR 18·5), other group B serovars
(OR 13·6), groups other than B, C, or D (OR 6·3), and
S. Typhimurium (OR 6·2) (vs. groups C and D). A high
density of pig farms in the commune was also a risk.
The calculated OR of 1·4 is equivalent to an OR of 6·8

for a farm located in a commune with a density of 86
pig farms/km2 (75% quantile) vs. farms in communes
with density of 16 pig farms/km2 (25% quantile). The
human density was not associated with increased resist-
ance and was therefore excluded from the model (Table 4).

Serovar allocation to representative AMR/serogroup
patterns by MLST

Of isolates other than S. Typhimurium and mST
(n = 632) there were 63 unique patterns reﬂecting the
combinations of NTS group (groups B, C, D, and
other) and AMR test result. A total of 14 different sero-
vars were identiﬁed by testing one randomly selected iso-
late within each pattern. A total of 391/632 isolates
(61·9%) corresponded to seven patterns of isolates either

DISCUSSION

Results from this study indicate an unusually high farm-
level prevalence of NTS (73%) in the Mekong Delta of
Vietnam, the highest (>90%) corresponding to pig and
duck farms. Farms surveyed in the European Union
(EU) using standardized methodologies (2005–2008)

had a marked overall lower prevalence, although NTS
was more common in pig farms (33·3%) compared to
chicken broiler and layer farms (23·7 and 30·8%,
respectively) [25–27].

In our survey duck farms had the highest farm-level
NTS prevalence (94·3%). A possible explanation is the
relatively less attention to biosecurity and the charac-
teristic management system of duck ﬂocks that involve
grazing on rice ﬁelds [28]. A previous study also
reported a higher animal-level prevalence in ducks
(8·7%) compared to pigs and chickens (5·2–7·9%) in
the Mekong Delta, although these differences were
not signiﬁcant
[29]. Data from Denmark (2012),
where duck ﬂocks are routinely monitored, indicate
a higher prevalence of NTS infection in duck ﬂocks
compared to chicken ﬂocks (46·0% vs. 0·8%) [30].
Our data also indicated that, of the three species,
ducks also had the highest per sample prevalence.
This probably reﬂects higher levels of animal-level in-
fection, since the sensitivity of pooled samples is a
function of within bird-level prevalence [31].

A high frequency of rat sightings on farms was a
signiﬁcant risk factor. Studies have documented an as-
sociation between rodents and increased risk of NTS
on farms [32, 33]. Rats are extremely prevalent in
the Mekong Delta. A study on 600 rats trapped in

several Mekong Delta provinces indicated high NTS
prevalence (19·3%) (40% for rats trapped in Dong
Thap). A total of 94% rats were colonized by either
NTS serovars London, Weltevreden or Derby, all
identiﬁed in our study [34]. Most farm buildings in
the Mekong Delta are not rat-proof, and pest control
measures are normally insufﬁcient. In these circum-
stances rodents can easily access feed storages where
they often defecate. This may plausibly contribute to
infection of farmed animals through consumption of
contaminated feed. The signiﬁcant (protective) inter-
action between ducks and rodents suggests that, unlike
in the case of pigs and chickens, rats probably play a
lesser role in transmission of NTS to ducks, and other
sources linked to their grazing practices may be more
relevant. However the low levels of biosecurity in
Mekong Delta farms suggest the potential role of
many potential vectors and reservoirs.

We report a higher risk in larger pig farms (n > 50),
in agreement with previous studies [35, 36], reﬂecting
the challenge in controlling NTS in pig production,
probably due to the continuous introduction of new
NTS strains via replacement of breeding stock, as
well as the intrinsic difﬁculties of adequately disinfect-
ing occupied buildings.

Although most NTS infections in animals are
asymptomatic, some host species-adapted serovars
such as S. Cholerasuis and S. Typhisuis (pigs) and
S. Pullorum and S. Gallinarum (chickens) often
cause fatal disease [37]. In pigs, septicaemic episodes
of S. Typhimurium have been reported [38]. In
Mekong Delta pig farmers there is a strong perception
that NTS infections cause signiﬁcant production
losses, and this explains the high proportion of farm
owners reporting routine vaccination (94%).

Of the three animal species investigated, serovars S.
Typhimurium and mST were more common in ducks.
This is in contrast with European countries where
these serovars are predominantly isolated from pig
farms and pork [25, 39, 40]; however, the size of the
duck industry in the EU is very small and data on
NTS prevalence in ducks is limited.

The negative association between mST and munici-
pal water suggests that water sources other than mu-
nicipal water (i.e. river, well or rain water) may
represent potential risks, although no speciﬁc water
source categories remained signiﬁcant in the multi-
variable models.

With the exception of tetracyclines, against which
most (77·8%) isolates were resistant, levels of resistance

were generally lower (22·8–27·0%) compared to NTS
isolates from meat samples in northern Vietnam
(24·5–39·8%) [12, 41]. We found a strong association
between group B serovars and AMR, independent of
the animal host species, with the highest prevalence of
MDR corresponding to mST, followed by ‘other’
group B serovars.

Compared to chicken and duck isolates, a higher
proportion of NTS isolates from pigs were antimicro-
bial resistant. In addition AMR was partly explained
by the density of pig farms, suggesting that environ-
mental contamination with antimicrobials or other
AMR organisms from pig farms in the vicinity
could have an impact beyond the pig farms them-
selves. Nevertheless, our results are in agreement
with routine monitoring data collected in the EU
where resistance levels in isolates from pigs against tet-
racyclines, ampicillin and sulphonamides were higher
than in broiler isolates (55–59% vs. 20–27%). By con-
trast, EU chicken NTS isolates had moderate to high
levels of
resistance against nalidixic acid and
ciproﬂoxacin (23–24%), whereas pig isolates had low
levels of resistance (2–3%) [42]. However, surveillance
data on AMR from animal NTS in the EU indicate
resistance based on EUCAST epidemiological cut-off
values, not clinical breakpoints. Because of this, the
observed differences should be viewed with caution.

NTS isolates had low levels of AMR (<1%) against
third-generation cephalosporins, in agreement with pre-
vious ﬁndings [9, 12, 43], and in contrast with data from
Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand (>3%) [44].

The emergence of mST worldwide has been asso-
ciated with clonal groups resistant to ampicillin, sul-
phonamides, streptomycin and tetracyclines [45, 46].

Although we did not test for streptomycin resistance,
our results conﬁrm a high proportion (31·1%) of
mST co-resistant against ampicillin, sulphonamides
and tetracyclines, vs. 16·9% in other serovars (data
not shown).

We used MLST to test isolates representing unique
serogroup/AMR combinations, excluding fully sus-
ceptible or tetracycline resistant-only isolates. Unfortu-
nately, we could not perform MLST testing on all 739
isolates due to economic limitations. Clearly testing
was insufﬁcient for the (more common) fully susceptible
or tetracycline-only susceptible serovars. It is expected
that more economic alternatives to conventional sero-
typing will become available in developing countries to
enable the characterization of NTS on farms and the in-
vestigation of human outbreaks [39].

In summary, we demonstrated an exceptionally
high prevalence and high diversity in NTS serovars
across farms in the Mekong Delta. Of the three species
investigated, ducks had the highest NTS prevalence
although pigs were associated with the highest levels
of MDR. Levels of AMR were considerably high
for most antimicrobials investigated, except for amox-
icillin/clavulanic
third-
generation cephalosporins.

Our study conﬁrmed the widespread presence of
MDR mST in Mekong Delta farms, as reported in
other countries. Farming practices in the Mekong
Delta are typical of many developing countries in
the region. There is a concern that fast increases in an-
imal production are not matched by increases in bio-
security and testing programmes

pathogens. In Vietnam, virtually no NTS serotyping
is
conducted in human or animal diagnostic

laboratories. However, given the country’s rapid econ-
omic development and the increasing potential for ex-
port markets this may soon change. The unusually
high prevalence, the predominance of mixed-species
farming without adequate biosecurity, and the abun-
dance of vectors (rats) suggest that control of NTS
on farms in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam will be par-
ticularly challenging.
