The present study was undertaken to determine the occurrence and characterization of extended
spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli isolated from cattle and poultry in Odisha,
India. Of 316 E. coli isolated from 305 samples (170 fecal samples from poultry and 135 milk samples
from cattle), a total of 18 E. coli isolates were conﬁrmed as ESBL producers by combination disc method
and ESBL E-test. The isolates were resistant to oxyimino cephalosporins and monobactam as revealed by
disc diffusion assay and determination of minimum inhibitory concentration. Resistance against other
antibiotics was frequently noted as well. Further, beta-lactamase genes viz., blaSHV, blaCTXM, blaTEM
and blaampC were detected in 17, 13, 9 and 2 isolates, respectively in PCR. Of the 18 ESBL strains, 16 were
positive for class I integron (int1), nine of them carried sulphonamide resistance gene (sul1) and one
harbored quinolone resistance gene (qnrB). Virulence markers for extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli like
astA, tsh and iucD were also present in 4, 3 and 3 isolates, respectively. All the PCR ampliﬁed products
were cloned and subjected to sequencing for homology analysis and data were submitted to gene bank.
Sequence analysis of the ampliﬁed variable regions of class 1 integron of four representative isolates
revealed the presence of aadA2 and dfrA12 gene cassettes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides and
trimethoprim, respectively. Most of the ESBL producing strains emerged as single lineage through
phylogenetic analysis by RAPD and ERIC PCR. This is the ﬁrst ever systemic study on multidrug resistant
ESBL producing E. coli in food producing animals from India.

1. Introduction

Emergence and dissemination of extended spectrum beta-lacta-
mase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli were mostly reported from
nosocomial outbreaks, but in recent days, these are also being
reported from community infections as well (Oteo et al., 2010).
More importantly, detection of ESBL producing E. coli in food pro-
ducing animals and edible animal products has become a serious
cause of concern for the consumers (Geser et al., 2012; Machado
et al., 2008). This poses a great challenge to medical and veterinary

practitioners, as these ESBL producing E. coli can inactivate beta-
lactam antibiotics containing oxyimino group, especially the 3rd
and 4th generation cephalosporins and monobactam (Oteo et al.,
2010). Added to this, ESBL producers are also resistant to other
antibiotics such as ﬂuoroquinones, aminoglycosides and trimetho-
prim–sulfamethoxazole (Machado et al., 2008; Pasom et al., 2013;
Rath et al., 2014).

In India, ESBL producing E. coli have been reported in hospital-
ized patients, from various states over the last few years (Dutta
et al., 2013; Mukherjee et al., 2013; Oberoi et al., 2013; Rath
et al., 2014). In spite of this, no systematic study on ESBL producing
Enterobacteriaceae has been conducted in food animals in India
despite the fact that both animals and human share a close rela-
tionship. Besides, indiscriminate use of antibiotics in livestock
often establishes selection pressure for emergence of several anti-
biotic resistant strains, including ESBL producers in animals. By
this, these animals not only act as a mere reservoir but at times

may transmit these pathogens to human beings through direct and
indirect contact. Furthermore, the presence of various cardinal vir-
ulence genes in ESBL producers may increase the pathogenicity
and complicate the therapeutic strategy (Dutta et al., 2013).

Under these circumstances, the present study was undertaken
to determine the occurrence of ESBL producing E. coli in poultry
and cattle from different districts of Odisha, India and their further
characterization through drug resistance pattern, identiﬁcation of
ESBL and other putative virulence genes, randomly ampliﬁed poly-
morphic DNA PCR (RAPD PCR) and enterobacterial repetitive inter-
genic consensus polymerase chain reaction (ERIC PCR).

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sample collection and isolation of E. coli

A total of three hundred and ﬁve (n = 305) samples (170 poultry
feces and 135 cattle milk) were collected from ﬁve different dis-
tricts of Odisha (India) during July 2013 to March 2014 (Table 1).
Out of 170 fecal samples, 33 were from healthy and 137 were from
diarrheic birds. Of the 135 milk samples, 23 were from apparently
healthy cow without any evidence of mastitis and 112 samples
were from cattle with clinical and subclinical mastitis (determined
by somatic cell count). All the samples were collected in sterile col-
lection vials and transported to laboratory maintaining proper cold
chain for isolation and biochemical characterization of E. coli fol-
lowing standard procedure (Quinn et al., 1994).

2.2. Phenotypic conﬁrmation for extended spectrum beta-lactamase
production by E. coli isolates

For phenotypic conﬁrmation of ESBL production, all the con-
ﬁrmed E. coli isolates were screened for their susceptibility to 3rd
and 4th generation cephalosporins and monobactam by disc diffu-
sion method using the commercially available discs (BD BBL™,
India) of cefpodoxime (CPD 10 lg), ceftazidime
USA/HiMedia,
(CAZ 30 lg), cefotaxime (CTX 30 lg), cefepime (CPM 30 lg) and
aztreonam (ATZ 30 lg). The isolates exhibiting reduced suscepti-
bility to any of these antibiotics were further subjected to combi-
nation disc method and ESBL E-test (Andrews, 2012).

2.3. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of all the phenotypically
conﬁrmed ESBL producing E. coli strains was performed by
standard disc diffusion method against 19 different antibiotic discs
[BD BBL™, USA/HiMedia, India] representing 10 diverse classes;
amikacin (AK 30 lg), amoxicillin–clavulanic acid (AMC 20/10 lg),
ceftriaxone (CTR 30 lg), cefepirome (CFP 30 lg), ceftizoxime
(CZX 30 lg), cefepime–tazobactam (CPT 80/10 lg), chlorampheni-
col (C 30 lg), ciproﬂoxacin (CIP 5 lg), co-trimoxazole (COT 1.25/
23.75 lg), gatiﬂoxacin (GAT 5 lg), imipenem (IMP 10 lg), levoﬂox-
acin (LE 5 lg), lomeﬂoxacin (LOM 10 lg), norﬂoxacin (NX 10 lg),
piperacillin–tazobactam (PIT 100/10 lg), polymyxin B (PB 300 U),
tetracycline (TE 30 lg) and tobramycin (TOB 10 lg). The isolates
were categorized as sensitive, intermediately resistant or resistant
based on the results interpreted following the recommendations of
CLSI (2014).

2.4. Phenotypic assays for detection of AmpC beta-lactamase,
carbapenemase and metallo-beta-lactamase production

All the ESBL producing isolates were subjected to cefoxitin–
cloxacillin double disc synergy (CC-DDS) test and AmpC beta-
lactamase (ACBL) detection E-test (HiMedia, India) for phenotypic

conﬁrmation of ACBL production following previously described
protocol (Polsfuss et al., 2011). Further, all the imipenem resistant
ESBL producers were subjected to modiﬁed hodge test (MHT) and
combination disc diffusion test (CDDT) [IMP-10 lg and IMP-10 lg
+ EDTA-750 lg] to conﬁrm carbapenemase and metallo-beta-
lactamase (MBL) production (Birgy et al., 2012).

2.5. Determination of minimum inhibitory concentration

Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of

cefotaxime,
ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and aztreonam for all the phenotypically
conﬁrmed ESBL producers were determined using Hi-comb MIC test
strip (HiMedia, India), with concentration gradient of 0.1–240 and
0.001–30 lg/ml on Mueller Hinton Agar plate.

2.6. PCR based detection of antimicrobial resistance and putative
virulence genes

DNA was extracted from bacterial isolates conﬁrmed for ESBL
production by standard heat lysis protocol and were analyzed for
the presence of major beta-lactamase genes – blaCTXM, blaSHV,
blaTEM, blaOXA 1 and blaOXA 2 (Bhattacharjee et al., 2007),
blaampC (Shahid et al., 2012), plasmid mediated quinolone
resistance (PMQR) determinants such as qnrA, qnrB and qnrS
(Ciesielczuk et al., 2013), class I integron [int 1] (Levesque et al.,
1995), sulphonamide resistance [sul1] (Kerrn et al., 2002) genes,
cardinal virulence markers for shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC;
stx 1 and stx 2), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC: eaeA), enterohem-
olysin (hlyA), and extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) such as
papC, iucD, tsh, astA, cnf 1 and 2, f17 and sfaDE (Bandyopadhyay
et al., 2012; Ewers et al., 2009; Van Bost et al., 2003) by PCR. Details
regarding oligonucleotide primers and PCR conditions used are
illustrated in Table 2. All the PCR reactions were performed either
in Gene Amp PCR system or in Veriti 96-Well thermal cycler
(Applied Biosystems, USA). The ampliﬁed products were visualized
by a gel documentation system after electrophoresis in 1.5% (w/v)
agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (0.5 lg/ml, Sigma, USA).

2.7. Cloning and sequencing

Ampliﬁed PCR products were puriﬁed using gel puriﬁcation kit
(Fermentas, USA) and cloned in pGMET-Easy vector (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) or pTZ57/R (Fermentas, USA). The plasmids
containing the expected insert were sequenced using the BigDye
TerminatorÒ v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems Inc.,
Foster City, CA, USA) on an automated sequencer (Applied
Biosystems 3130 Genetic Analyzer) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. After sequencing, homology searches were made
using BLAST algorithm available at http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/Blast.cgi.

2.8. Phylogenetic analysis of the ESBL producing E. coli by RAPD PCR
and ERIC PCR

All the conﬁrmed ESBL producing E. coli isolates were subjected
to RAPD PCR and ERIC PCR following the PCR conditions
(Bandyopadhyay et al., 2012; Mohapatra and Mazumder, 2008)
described in Table 2. After electrophoresis in 2% (w/v) agarose
gel containing ethidium bromide (0.5 lg/ml), images were taken
by the gel documentation system and analyzed using the Doc-itLs
image analysis software (UVP, USA). By comparing the differences
in the banding pattern, phylogenetic relationship among the
isolates was established. An unrooted phylogenetic tree was
made using neighbor-joining method to illustrate the degree of
genetic divergence and similarity among the ESBL producing
E. coli isolates.

2.9. Statistical analysis

Occurrence of ESBL producers in respect to the animals (poultry
and cattle) and districts was compared by v2 test using the SPSS
17.0 software.

3. Results

Of all the 305 samples screened, 316 isolates (poultry 252;
cattle milk 64) were conﬁrmed as E. coli based on morphological
and biochemical tests (Table 1).

A total of 18 E. coli isolates, from 16 different poultry fecal and 2
cattle milk samples were putatively identiﬁed as ESBL producers
by phenotypic screening tests viz., combination disc method and
ESBL E-test (Table 3). Of 16 ESBL producing isolates from poultry,
15 were from diarrheic cases and one was from healthy poultry
(PEC 4). However, both the ESBL producers (MEC 1 and MEC 2)
were isolated from mastitic milk only. All the 18 ESBL producers
were resistant (100%) to ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefotaxime,
aztreonam, cefpodoxime, cefepirome, ceftizoxime, tobramycin,
lomeﬂoxacin and polymyxin B as revealed by disc diffusion assay.
Resistance to other antibiotics such as amoxicillin–clavulanic acid
(94%), piperacillin + tazobactam (94%), co-trimoxazole (88%), levo-
ﬂoxacin (88%), ciproﬂoxacin (83%), norﬂoxacin (78%), teteracycline
(77%), gatiﬂoxacin (72%), cefepime (66%), chloramphenicol (61%),
cefepime–tazobactam (61%), imipenem (27%) and amikacin (22%)
was also noted (Table 3). The range of MIC values of cefotaxime
(5 to >240 lg/ml), ceftazidime (30 to >240 lg/ml), ceftriaxone
(0.01 to >240 lg/ml) and aztreonam (0.1 to >60 lg/ml) for the
conﬁrmed ESBL producers indicating their resistance to cephalo-
sporins and monobactam are given in Table 3. Only two of the ESBL
producers (PEC 10 and MEC 2) were conﬁrmed for ACBL
production.

All the 18 isolates were further subjected to PCR and sequenc-
ing analysis for detection of beta-lactamase genes – blaSHV (Acces-
sion No: KJ715877), blaTEM (Accession No: KF906263) and
blaCTXM (Accession No: KJ851209). The genes blaSHV, blaCTXM
and blaTEM were detected in 17, 13 and 9 isolates, respectively
(Table 3). Two of the ESBL producers (PEC 10 and MEC 2), which
were phenotypically conﬁrmed as ACBL producers, also carried
the blaampC gene. Sixteen of the 18 ESBL producers (88.88%) were
found positive for int1 in PCR and nine of them carried sul1 gene
(Accession No: KJ801663). To identify the gene cassettes in the
class I integron, the class I variable zone was ampliﬁed using
primers 50-CS/30-CS (Table 2) and ampliﬁed products of 1009 bp
(PEC-6), 1590 bp (PEC 16), 1913 bp (PEC 9) and 1915 bp (PEC 4)
from four representative isolates were cloned and sequenced. Class
I integron from all these isolates – PEC 4 (Accession No: KJ851208),
PEC 6 (Accession No: KJ775803), PEC 9 (Accession No: KM403389)
and PEC 16 (Accession No: KM272943) was found to carry the gene
cassette encoding aminoglycoside adenyltransferase A enzyme
(aadA2) conferring resistance to aminoglycosides and spectinomy-
cin. Additionally, the class I integron of PEC 4, PEC 9 and PEC 16
harbored gene cassette encoding for dihydrofolate reductase
(dfrA12) responsible for resistance to trimethoprim. Among the
PMQR genes (qnrA, qnrB and qnrS), only qnrB (Accession No:
KJ872635) was detected in one isolate (PEC 14) from poultry
(Table 3). None of the 18 ESBL producing E. coli carried character-
istic virulence genes of STEC (stx 1, stx 2) and EPEC (eaeA) and hlyA.
However, virulence markers for ExPEC were detected in few
isolates. Four isolates (PEC 3, PEC 14, PEC 15 and PEC 16) were
positive for astA gene, three each for tsh (PEC 11, PEC 12 and PEC
13) and iucD (PEC 11, PEC 13 and PEC 16) genes [Accession Nos:
KJ697771 and KJ715876], respectively. Two isolates (PEC 11 and
PEC 13) carried both tsh and iucD whereas one isolate (PEC 16)
was positive for both astA and iucD genes (Table 3).

Fig. 2. Phylogenetic analysis of ESBL producing Escherichia coli isolates isolated from poultry and cattle in Odisha (India). The neighbor-joining method was used to
summarize the similarity of ERIC PCR proﬁles of the strains in a dendrogram containing four major clusters (A–D).

All the 18 ESBL producing strains were characterized by RAPD
and ERIC PCR to determine the genetic diversity and phylogenetic
relationship among the strains. In RAPD, all the isolates were type-
able and produced amplicon size ranging from 268 to 2322 bp
(Fig. 1) and were grouped in ﬁve different clusters (A–E). Of them,
cluster A (PEC 5), B (PEC 14) and E (MEC 1) contained one isolate in
each clade. Most of the poultry isolates were placed under the two
sub-clusters of cluster D. All the strains were typeable with ERIC
PCR with ampliﬁed fragment size ranging from 104 to 3222 bp
(Fig. 2). Upon analysis, all the 18 isolates were distributed in 4 clus-
ters (A–D) wherein cluster A (MEC1) and cluster D (PEC2) harbored
one isolate in each clade. In cluster B, 4 poultry isolates (PEC 13,
PEC 14, PEC 15 and PEC 16) were grouped with one cattle isolate
(MEC 2). It is interesting to note that, 11 poultry isolates were
grouped in a single cluster (C), and six of them in two separate
groups [(PEC4, PEC 6, PEC 7 and PEC 8); (PEC 9 and PEC 11)]
produced similar band pattern.

4. Discussion

In recent past, there has been increased resistance to beta-
lactam antibiotics due to plasmid mediated acquisition of ESBL

producing genes predominantly by E. coli and Klebsiella of Entero-
bacteriaceae family. Although most of the studies conducted on
ESBL producers are conﬁned within the hospital premises, focus
should also be given on its occurrence and dissemination in food
producing animals as recent reports by several researchers also
indicate its presence in chicken meat and raw milk (Geser et al.,
2012; Lyhs et al., 2012). However, this knowledge is so far limited
in India. Hence, the present study was undertaken to study the
occurrence of multidrug resistant (MDR) ESBL producing E. coli in
poultry and cattle in Odisha (India).

coli

in poultry (16 of 170 samples) was

In total, ESBL producing E. coli were detected in 5.9% (18 of 305)
of cattle milk and poultry fecal samples screened from ﬁve differ-
ent districts of Odisha. There was no signiﬁcant difference in the
occurrence of ESBL producers in different districts (p = 0.9,
v2 = 0.89, df = 4). However, the occurrence of ESBL producing
signiﬁcantly
E.
(p = 0.0057, v2 = 7.6, df = 1) higher than in cattle (2 of 135 samples)
(Table 1). There is hardly any report available in livestock sector
from India to corroborate with our ﬁndings. Even in a recent study
conducted in backyard poultry in a neighboring state by this group
of authors, no such ESBL producing E. coli were found (Samanta et al.,
2014). Although occurrence of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase
and ESBL producing E. coli was reported in bovine mastitis

D. Kar et al. / Infection, Genetics and Evolution 29 (2015) 82–90

89

(Ghatak et al., 2013), such report did not elaborate on sampling
pattern or size and prevalence rate. In contrast, the occurrence of
ESBL producing E. coli has been increasingly reported in human
patients over last few years from various states of India including
Odisha (Mukherjee et al., 2013; Oberoi et al., 2013; Rath et al.,
2014). In this study, two of ESBL producing isolates were conﬁrmed
as ACBL producers by CC-DDS test and PCR. Although, no report on
prevalence of ACBL producing E. coli in cattle or poultry are avail-
able from India till date, such coproduction of ESBL and ACBL is
not uncommon among human isolates (Oberoi et al., 2013).

Although, full sequencing of the b-lactamase genes was not per-
formed in the present study, some indications can be deduced from
the sequences of the PCR products. In particular, sequence analysis
of blaSHV gene detected in 17 ESBL producers in this study revealed
to have two substitutions [G238S + E240K] usually found in SHV-
12. The SHV-12 allele has been reported in almost all the ESBL pro-
ducing Enterobacteriaceae across the globe which indicates that it is
possibly a part of worldwide disseminating mobile element
(Schmitt et al., 2007). Similarly, BLAST analysis of the ampliﬁed
blaCTX-M gene indicated that the ESBL producers of the present
study possibly carried the genes for CTX-M-15 enzyme which
has been widely reported among ESBL isolates from various
countries including India (Muzaheed et al., 2009). In contrast, the
blaTEM sequence (KF906263) obtained in this study signiﬁcantly
aligned with TEM-1, a non-ESBL enzyme. However,
it is not
uncommon to detect TEM-1 among ESBL producers, as several
TEM-1 variants were also reported to confer ESBL properties in
previous studies (Diwan et al., 2012). Furthermore, 13 of the 18
ESBL producers which carried blaTEM gene were also positive for
blaSHV and or blaCTX-M genes. Therefore, the possible role of these
genes either alone or in combination for ESBL production cannot be
ruled out.

Integrons are important genetic elements responsible for car-
riage and spread of antibiotic resistance determinants including
ESBL enzymes. Most of the ESBL isolates (16/18; 88.88%) in this
study carried class I integron with or without the virulence genes
associated with extra-intestinal infection such as astA, tsh and iucD
(Table 3). It is in corroboration with previous ﬁndings where class I
integron was detected in large proportion of ESBL producing ExPEC
isolated from human patients with urinary tract infection (Sun
et al., 2013). Sequence analysis of the ampliﬁed variable region of
class I integron revealed that the integrons possessed dfrA12 and
aadA2 gene cassettes conferring resistance to trimethoprim and
streptomycin as reported by several researchers previously (Sun
et al., 2013). This kind of gene cassette arrangement may be
responsible for emergence of multiple drug resistance among ESBL
producers isolated in this study.

Emergence of PMQR has been reported worldwide and is being
documented in ESBL producers in recent days (Pasom et al., 2013).
In the present study, none of the ESBL producing E. coli, except PEC
14 having qnrB, was found positive for any of the qnr markers
despite the fact that most of them were resistant to ﬂuoroquino-
lones tested in this study. Role of other resistance mechanisms like
mutations in the quinolone resistance determining region or pres-
ence of aac(60)-Ib-cr gene could also be one of the possible reasons
for ﬂuoroquinolone resistance as documented earlier in India
(Diwan et al., 2012). Further, majority of the ESBL producing iso-
lates in the present study were susceptible to amikacin (78%)
and imipenem (73%) which is in agreement with a recent ﬁnding
from Bhopal (Shashwati et al., 2014). Although, few isolates were
resistant or intermediately resistant to imipenem, none were carb-
apenemase or MBL producer as evidenced by MHT and CDDT. Fur-
thermore, none of them were positive for blaNDM gene. Such
carbapenem resistance could have resulted from high expression
of ACBL or ESBL in combination with porin loss (Cohen Stuart
and Leverstein-Van Hall, 2010). Remarkably, all the ESBL producers

of this study were resistant to amoxicillin–clavulanic acid and
polymyxin B. Various mechanisms like overproduction of beta-lac-
tamases (TEM and SHV), inhibitor-resistant TEM beta-lactamase or
penicillinase and ACBL (as detected in 2 isolates) are believed to
trigger AMC resistance in E. coli isolates (Belmar-Liberato et al.,
2011). Although resistance to polymyxin B is rare among
Gram-negative bacteria, this has been recently detected in an
E. coli isolate possessing CTX-M-15 enzyme from human patient
(Urban et al., 2011). Indiscriminate use of polymyxin B or other
related antimicrobial peptide like colistin (polymyxin E) in poultry
for Gram negative infections may have led to selection of
polymyxin-resistant ESBL producing E. coli, probably due to
altered membrane permeability or efﬂux mechanism (Urban
et al., 2011).

Various virulence markers of ExPEC like tsh, iucD and astA were
detected in few ESBL producing E. coli strains from poultry in the
present study (Table 3). This ﬁnding cannot be compared as the
occurrence of virulence markers of ExPEC in ESBL producers is
rarely reported. However, in our previous study in the backyard
poultry sector of West Bengal, about 14.3% of the E. coli isolates
were found positive for astA gene; although they did not possess
other virulence or beta-lactamase genes probably due to
differences in the rearing practices of poultry in backyard farming
(Samanta et al., 2014). Likewise, Lyhs et al. (2012) could not detect
any ESBL producing ExPEC from poultry in Finland. In contrast,
ESBL producing ExPEC was reported from dogs and cats in
Switzerland (Huber et al., 2013). Detection of ExPEC markers
among ESBL producers is a serious public health concern as such
resistant ExPEC may contaminate the poultry meat and upon
consumption by human beings may cause serious extraintestinal
infection.

In general, phylogenetic analysis using RAPD and ERIC PCR was
found effective for determination of genomic diversity among the
ESBL producing E. coli strains. Few isolates displayed almost iden-
tical phylogenetic picture using both the tools. Two sets of poultry
isolates (PEC 9, PEC 10 and PEC 11; PEC 3 and PEC 5) were placed in
same sub-clusters in both the RAPD and ERIC PCR based dendro-
grams. Likewise, poultry isolates (PEC 14, PEC 15 and PEC 16) were
also grouped together with the cattle isolate (MEC 2). Altogether, it
indicated genetic relatedness among these isolates despite the fact
that they were isolated from different animals and different areas
of Odisha. Furthermore, the cattle isolate (MEC 1) was placed in a
separate cluster in both the tools (cluster E in RAPD and cluster A in
ERIC) indicating the possibility of a distinct ancestral lineage of this
isolate. Interestingly, the isolates (PEC4, PEC 6, PEC 7 and PEC 8)
which produced similar band pattern in ERIC PCR were differenti-
ated by RAPD. In contrast, the isolates (PEC 8 and PEC 12) grouped
in one sub-cluster in RAPD were placed in separate clusters in ERIC
PCR. The incongruity of the two tools may have reﬂected the differ-
ence of the target regions of the tools as randomly selected parts of
the chromosome are explored in RAPD PCR whereas the intergenic
regions of polycistronic operons or untranslated regions upstream
or downstream of open reading frames are screened by ERIC PCR
(Bandyopadhyay et al., 2012). Although, no RAPD/ERIC speciﬁc
proﬁle could be established based on the source (host) of isolation,
virulence pattern or resistance gene proﬁle, both the tools were
effective for differentiation of ESBL producing E. coli isolates, as
most of the strains emerged as single lineage using both the typing
methods. This is in corroboration with our previous observations
among the E. coli
isolates from poultry and other bovines
(Bandyopadhyay et al., 2012; Mahanti et al., 2013; Samanta
et al., 2014).

This is the ﬁrst ever systematic study on occurrence and
characterization of MDR ESBL producing E. coli from food produc-
ing animals in India. Some of these isolates also harbored virulence
markers of ExPEC which is really a grave public health concern.

Further study is required to ﬁnd out the nature of selective pres-
sure instrumental in promoting the recombination of such viru-
lence and resistance genes in animals.
