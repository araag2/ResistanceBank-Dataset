Abstract Cephalosporins are major antimicrobials used
to treat serious infections. However, their effectiveness is
being compromised by the emergence of extended-
spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs). A total of 138 enteric
bacteria were isolated from 53 faecal samples of pigs
collected from different districts of Mizoram, of which 102
(73.91 %) were Escherichia coli, 26 (18.84 %) were
Salmonella spp. and 10 (7.25 %) were Klebsiella pneu-
moniae. Phenotypic conﬁrmatory test (Double Discs Syn-
ergy Test) showed that 8 (5.80 %) E. coli isolates were
ESBLs producer. PCR analysis conﬁrmed that out of the
eight isolate, 7 (5.07 %) harboured blaCTX-M-1 gene and/or
blaTEM gene. Of the eight positive isolates, 7 (5.07 %) and
3 (2.17 %) were found to be positive for blaCTX-M-1 gene
and blaTEM gene, respectively, of which 3 (2.17 %) isolates
were positive for both the genes. Only 4 (2.90 %) E. coli
isolates carried blaCTX-M-1 gene alone. Agarose gel elec-
trophoresis showed that all
the isolates were carrying
plasmids ranging between 0.9 and *30 kb. Out of the
seven isolates positive for blaCTX-M-1 and/or blaTEM, 2
(1.84 %) isolates were conﬁrmed for blaCTX-M-1 gene in
their plasmid. Only one E. coli isolate was found to be
positive for both the genes in its plasmid. The resistance
plasmid could not be transferred to a recipient by in vitro
horizontal gene transfer method.

Introduction

The rapid emergence of extended-spectrum b-lactamases
(ESBLs) in the food producing animals has been recorded
and published worldwide [1–5]. It is important to note its
impact on the treatment and therapeutic strategy of serious
infections [6–10]. Food animals, including pigs are one of
the most important sources of development of multi-drug
resistant (MDR) bacteria because of continuous use of
antibiotics as feed additives and growth promoting factors
in a sub-therapeutic level [11–13]. This practice may lead
to selection of a resistant population in the native micro-
biota of the animal and the local environment due to
shedding through faeces. The MDR bacteria may re-enter
the human and animal populations through various routes
including natural water, irrigation water, drinking water,
vegetables and foods. The present study is carried out to
record the prevalence of ESBLs producing Escherichia
coli, Salmonella spp. and Klebsiella pneumoniae in pig
population in North Eastern India.

Materials and Methods

Bacterial Isolates

A total of 53 faecal samples from pigs were collected from
different districts of Mizoram between September 2011
and March 2012. Samples were collected from animal of
either sex, irrespective of their age, sex or breed. Animals
under the study were reared under different housing system
and belonged to organized as well as unorganized farms.
Samples were collected by dry rectal swabbing. However,
for collection of samples from distant locations, a sterilized
swab dipped in nutrient broth was used as transport

medium. Each swab containing the collected sample was
then inserted into separate sterilized test tube and carried to
the laboratory under cold chain for further processing.

For isolation of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, the collected
faecal samples were inoculated on MLA and single colo-
nies were selected and conﬁrmed by standard bacterio-
logical technique. For isolation of Salmonellae, samples
were ﬁrst enriched in Selenite F broth, and streaked on
Salmonella Shigella agar plate. Pure colonies were then
selected and identiﬁed as per standard bacteriological
technique [14].

Phenotypic Detection of ESBLs

All the isolates were subjected to in vitro antibiotic sensi-
tivity test by disc diffusion method against commonly used
antibiotics as per the recommendation of Clinical Labora-
tory Standard Institute [15]. The antibiotics used for the
study were ceftriaxone, cephotaxime, ceﬁxime, cefazolin,
cephalexin, ampicillin, erythromycin, chlortetracycline,
streptomycin, enroﬂoxacin, oxytetracycline and lincomy-
cin. The isolates exhibiting resistance to the extended-
spectrum cephalosporin group of antibiotics were selected
for conﬁrmation of ESBLs production by placing cefo-
taxime and cefotaxime/clavulanate discs on the inoculated
Mueller–Hinton agar plate at a distance of 30 cm apart. It
was incubated overnight and the increase in zone size of
more than 5 mm was considered as positive for ESBLs
production.

Characterization of ESBLs Producing Isolates

Bacterial lysate was prepared from all the isolates found to
be positive for ESBLs production phenotypically, and were
tested for the presence of blaCTX-M-1 and blaTEM genes by
PCR assay using speciﬁc primers (Table 1). PCR was
carried out in a 0.2 ml thin wall PCR tubes using the
bacterial lysate as template DNA with a ﬁnal volume of
25 ll containing 109 buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 pM of
each oligonucleotide primers, 200 lM of each dNTPS, 1 U
of Taq polymerase and 4.0 ll DNA lysate. PCR was car-
ried out in a thermal cycler and the cycling condition for
blaCTX-M-1 was: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 7 min
followed by 30 cycles of ampliﬁcation with denaturation at

94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 57 °C for 30 s, and extension
at 72 °C for 30 s, ending with a ﬁnal extension at 72 °C for
5 min. For blaTEM gene, the annealing temperature was
53 °C.

Multiplex PCR was carried out using the same compo-
sition of PCR reaction mixture mentioned above. However,
the annealing temperature was set to 54 °C.

Extraction of Plasmid and Genomic DNA

Plasmid DNA was extracted as per the method described
by Sambrook and Russel [16] and the chromosomal DNA
was extracted as per the method of Nazik et al. [17] from
the isolates harbouring the ESBLs genes. PCR was per-
formed using the Plasmid and chromosomal DNA sepa-
rately following the above mentioned settings to ﬁnd out
the location of the target genes.

Curing of Plasmid

All the isolates, carrying blaCTX-M-1 and/or blaTEM genes in
their plasmid were subjected to curing using acridine
orange as curing agent following the method described by
Silhavy et al. [18] with suitable modiﬁcations. In brief,
0.2 ml of overnight culture was inoculated in 5 ml LB
broth containing different concentrations (2.5, 1.25, 1.0,
0.7, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.1 mg/ml) of acridine orange. Positive
control contained only cells without acridine orange, while
negative control contained only acridine orange without
cells. All the tubes were incubated (in dark) at 37 °C for
overnight. Next day tubes containing the highest concen-
tration of acridine orange showing growth were selected
and loopful was streaked on Mac Conkey’s agar plates and
incubated overnight.

Horizontal Gene Transfer

The ability of transfer of antibiotic resistance genes within
Enterobacteriaceae group of bacteria was recorded by
in vitro conjugation study. E. coli isolates harboring the
ESBLs gene were used as donor and Salmonella enteritidis
(ATCC 13076), which was made resistant to nalidixic acid
was used as recipient strain. The recipient strain was sen-
sitive to cefazolin, cephalexin, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime

plasmid as conﬁrmed by PCR analysis. In vitro mating
experiments were performed by broth mating [19], ﬁlter
paper mating [20] and plate mating [21]. Transconjugants
were selected on Mac Conkey’s agar containing ceftriax-
one (50 lg/ml) and nalidixic acid (100 lg/ml). Donor and
recipient strains were grown separately in antibiotic free
medium as well as antibiotic medium as control. Selected
transconjugants were further characterized for their anti-
microbial susceptibility, ESBLs phenotype and presence of
blaCTX-M-1 and/or blaTEM genes by PCR.

isolates were conﬁrmed to harbor the blaCTX-M-1 gene in
their plasmid. Only one blaTEM gene was detected in
plasmid.

Discussion

The present study revealed that blaCTX-M-1 is the most
abundant ESBLs type in this region, with E. coli being the
major ESBLs producer, which is in accordance with the
reports of other workers from different places of the world
[1, 3, 23]. And also the presence of more than one bla
genes is often reported worldwide [1, 23].

Prevalence of higher rate of CTX-M over TEM gene was
recorded in this study, which is in agreement with the
studies conducted by Ensor et al. [24] as well as Jones et al.
[25]. CTX-M may be increased due to wide use of third
generation cephalosporins, especially ceftriaxone and cef-
otaxime or may be associated with high mobilization of the
encoding genes [26]. Barlow et al. [27] reported that the
blaCTX-M genes have been mobilized to plasmid almost 10
times more frequently than other class A b-lactamases. The
predominance of CTX-M type of ESBLs gene is may be an
indication that this allele would now be common in North
East Region of India. Muzaheed et al. [28] also reported
high prevalence of CTX-M genes in K. pneumoniae and
E. coli from Southern India.

Out of the seven ESBLs positive isolates, six were
isolated from organized farm. Only one positive isolate
(PE29) was observed from the sample collected from local
backyard farm. It may be due to the frequent and routine
use of third generation antibiotics in the organized farm.
The prevalence of ESBLs in the farm animals is also
reported by other workers from India and abroad [1–3].

Most of the ESBLs producing organisms under this
study were also found to be co-resistant to ﬂuoroquino-
lones, aminoglycosides as well as co-trimoxazole, which
corroborate with the study done by Denholm et al. [29] and
Jabeen et al. [30]. Perez et al. [9] also reported similar kind
of information, where the ESBLs producing enteric bac-
to other group of antibiotics
teria are also resistant
including aminoglycosides,
sulfonamides,
trimethoprim and chloramphenicol. Development of
co-resistance against other antibiotics along with b-lactam
antibiotics by the ESBLs producing organisms generally
appeared in the large plasmids, where most of the resistant
genes may co-exist.

tetracycline,

In the present study, the resistant plasmids could be
successfully cured by acridine orange. Although curing
provides only the preliminary evidence that genetic traits
are of extra-chromosomal nature but loss of growth on
antibiotic containing plates also shows that the MDR genes
may be plasmid borne. The resistance determining traits
are often transposable, which exist in both plasmid and
chromosomal locations (ﬂip–ﬂop mechanism) [31]. It is
however, important to note that not all antibiotic resistance
genes are plasmid mediated [32] and copies of the plasmid
lying closer to the membranes are readily eliminated by

chemical agents, while those lying closer to the nucleus
may escape the curing effect, thereby; one may observe
partial curing [33].

isolate. Similarly,

During conjugation study neither of the plasmids car-
rying any one of the target gene could be transferred hor-
izontally
low
transconjugation success was also reported by other
workers in Switzerland and Germany [19, 34]. Franiczek
et al. [35] also reported that none of the four E. coli isolates
could transfer their resistance gene to other recipient
strains. Yuan et al. [36] reported that plasmids are trans-
ferred under the inﬂuence of environmental condition
(in vitro vs in vivo). In vitro experiment showed transfer of
the plasmids ranging from 108 to 157 kb, while in vivo
conjugation experiment showed a transfer of smaller sized
plasmids. Failure of conjugation in the present study may
be because of the small size plasmids carried by the donors.
It is suggestive to study the involvements of the insertion
sequence ISEcp1 [37, 38], as well as assessment of the
incompatibility group [39, 40] of the plasmid may help to
understand the failure.

In summary, we reported the presence of ESBLs in
Enterobacteriaceae from pigs in NER India. The ﬁndings
are worrisome as transmission to human via the food chain
of bacteria resistant to practically all antimicrobial classes
cannot be dismissed. More strict veterinary antibiotic pol-
icies are needed in order to prevent emergence and dis-
semination of these strains among animals and humans,
limiting future problems of therapy failure.
