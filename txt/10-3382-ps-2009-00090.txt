  ABSTRACT    The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  de-
termine  the  prevalence  and  antimicrobial  resistance 
of Campylobacter spp. isolated from chicken carcasses 
during different stages of broiler processing in a major 
commercial  poultry  processing  plant  in  southwestern 
Iran. Overall, 84 chicken carcasses were sampled from 
4  sites  along  the  processing  line  during  a  total  of  7 
visits.  In  addition,  14  water  samples  from  the  chiller 
tank  were  taken.  Using  the  cultural  method,  186  of 
336 (55.4%) carcasses were positive for Campylobacter. 
Campylobacter  jejuni  was  more  frequently  isolated 
(89.4%) than Campylobacter coli (10.6%). The frequen-
cy of Campylobacter spp. on carcasses was 54.8% after 
defeathering,  51.2%  after  evisceration,  69.0%  20  min 

after  the  chilling  period  started,  and  46.4%  24  h  af-
ter  the  chilling  period  completed.  Campylobacter  was 
positive in 85.7% of the samples taken from the chilling 
water.  The  frequency  of  Campylobacter  spp.-positive 
carcasses was reduced in complete chilled chickens but 
not during the slaughtering process. Susceptibilities of 
Campylobacter isolates were determined for 10 antimi-
crobial drugs using the disk diffusion method. Of the 
198 Campylobacter isolates tested, 92.9% were resistant 
to one or more antimicrobial agents. Resistance to tet-
racycline  was  the  most  common  finding  (78.3%),  fol-
lowed by resistance to ciprofloxacin (62.1%), nalidixic 
acid (58.6%), and enrofloxacin (44.4%). 

  INTRODUCTION 

Campylobacter  is  the  most  common  cause  of  acute 
bacterial gastroenteritis in human beings (Mead et al., 
1999). The most important Campylobacter spp. associ-
ated with human illness are Campylobacter jejuni and 
Campylobacter coli (Wesley et al., 2000). Chicken car-
casses are commonly contaminated with Campylobacter
in poultry processing plants (Atabay and Corry, 1997; 
Franchin et al., 2007). Studies have demonstrated high 
levels of Campylobacter on broiler chickens from farm 
(Stern  et  al.,  1995)  and  retail  chickens  (Rahimi  and 
Tajbakhsh,  2008),  ranging  from  40  to  100%  (Dickins 
et al., 2002). 

  Contamination during processing occurs directly via 
intestinal contents or indirectly from bird to bird, via 
equipment and water (Corry and Atabay, 2001). Bacte-

ria adhere to the skin surface and will subsequently form 
a biofilm that is difficult to remove. These microorgan-
isms encounter certain stressful events during slaughter 
and processing (Newell et al., 2001) but are largely pro-
tected from biocidal activities within that biofilm (Bus-
well et al., 1998). Several investigators have reported a 
high prevalence of Campylobacter spp. through broiler 
chicken  processing,  such  as  on  carcasses  collected  af-
ter  defeathering  (Cason  et  al.,  1997;  Franchin  et  al., 
2007), after evisceration and after water chilling (Cason 
et  al.,  1997;  Franchin  et  al.,  2007),  as  well  as  in  the 
final chilled product (Line, 2001). Consequently, under-
cooked and raw poultry meats are common vehicles for 
the  transmission  of  human  campylobacteriosis  (Corry 
and Atabay, 2001). 

  Currently, there is limited information regarding the 
prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of 
Campylobacter  in  poultry  products  in  Iran.  Further-
more, little is known about how processing procedures 
in poultry processing plants may affect the prevalence 
of Campylobacter in Iran. Therefore, the present study 
was conducted to determine the prevalence and antimi-
crobial resistance of Campylobacter spp. isolated during

different stages of broiler processing in a major com-
mercial poultry processing plant in southwestern Iran.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Samples

Chicken  carcasses  were  collected  during  7  visits  to 
a commercial poultry processing plant in Ahvaz from 
November  2007  to  December  2008.  Ahvaz,  located  in 
southwestern Iran, is the capital of the khuzestan prov-
ince, which has more than 4 million inhabitants. This 
processing plant is the primary poultry plant, with an 
average  of  140,000  chickens  being  processed  per  day. 
Carcasses were randomly chosen and collected by hand 
using  new  latex  gloves  for  each  carcass  from  4  sites 
along the processing line including after defeathering, 
after evisceration, 20 min after the chilling period start-
ed, and 24 h after the chilling period completed. Over-
all, 84 chicken carcasses were sampled at each techno-
logical  step  through  the  processing  line.  The  samples 
were placed in separate sterile plastic bags to prevent 
spilling  and  cross-contamination.  All  carcasses  were 
subjected to a whole-carcass rinse. Carcasses collected 
were shaken with 100 mL of sterile distilled water for 
60 s. The rinses were poured into 50-mL sterile speci-
men cups and refrigerated at 4°C. In addition, 14 water 
samples  from  the  chiller  tank  were  taken  during  the 
slaughter process and collected in sterile 50-mL plastic 
syringes. The samples were immediately transported to 
the laboratory in a cooler with ice packs and processed 
within 2 h.

Isolation and Identification  
of Campylobacter

Twenty-five  milliliters  of  sample  was  transferred 
to  225  mL  of  Preston  enrichment  broth  base  (M899, 
HiMedia  Laboratories,  Mumbai,  India)  containing 
Campylobacter selective supplement IV (FD042, HiMe-
dia Laboratories) and 5% (vol/vol) defibrinated sheep 
blood. After incubation at 42°C for 24 h in a microaero-
philic condition (85% N2, 10% CO2, 5% O2), 0.1 mL of 
the enrichment was streaked onto Campylobacter selec-
tive agar base (M994, HiMedia Laboratories) contain-
ing an antibiotic supplement for the selective isolation 
of Campylobacter spp. (FD006, HiMedia Laboratories) 

and 5% (vol/vol) defibrinated sheep blood and incubat-
ed for 48 h at 42°C under the same condition. For the 
chiller tank sample, 50 mL of water samples was added 
to 50 mL of double-strength Campylobacter enrichment 
broth (Preston enrichment broth base, M899, HiMedia 
Laboratories)  and  incubated  as  described  above.  One 
presumptive Campylobacter colony from each selective 
agar plate was subcultured and tested by standard mi-
crobiological and biochemical procedures (Bolton et al., 
1992).

DNA Extraction and PCR Conditions

Deoxyribonucleic acid from all 336 samples (4 × 84) 
was extracted from Preston broth after the enrichment 
step  using  a  Genomic  DNA  Purification  kit  (k0512, 
Fermentas GmbH, St. Leon-Rot, Germany; Sambrook 
and Russell, 2001) according to the manufacturer’s pro-
tocol. The PCR procedures used in this study have been 
described previously (Denis et al., 1999). Three genes 
selected for the identification of the Campylobacter spp., 
C. jejuni, and C. coli were the 16S rRNA gene (Linton 
et al., 1997), the mapA gene (Stucki et al., 1995), and 
the ceuE gene (Gonzalez et al., 1997), respectively. The 
sequences of the 3 sets of primers used for gene amplifi-
cation are presented in Table 1. Amplification reactions 
were  performed  in  a  30-μL  mixture  containing  0.6  U 
of Taq polymerase (Fermentas GmbH), 100 μmol·1−1 
of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 0.11 μmol·1−1 of 
MD16S1 and MD16S2 primers, and 0.42 μmol·1−1 of 
MDmapAl, MDmapA2, COL3, and MDCOL2 primers 
in the Fermentas buffer (Fermentas GmbH). Amplifica-
tion reactions were carried out using a DNA thermal 
cycler  (Master  Cycle  Gradiant,  Eppendorf,  Hamburg, 
Germany)  with  the  following  program:  1  cycle  of  10 
min at 95°C, 35 cycles each consisting of 30 s at 95°C, 1 
min and 30 s at 59°C, 1 min at 72°C, and a final exten-
sion step of 10 min at 72°C. The amplification generat-
ed 857-, 589-, and 462-bp DNA fragments correspond-
ing to the Campylobacter genus, C. jejuni, and C. coli, 
respectively. Campylobacter coli (ATCC 33559) and C. 
jejuni (ATCC 33560) were used as the positive controls 
and DNase-free water was used as the negative control. 
The PCR products were stained with a 1% solution of 
ethidium bromide and were visualized under UV light 
after gel electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose (Figure 1).

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by 
the kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method using Mueller-
Hinton agar (MV1084, HiMedia Laboratories) supple-
mented with 5% defibrinated sheep blood, according to 
the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Stan-
dards  (NCCLS,  2003)  guidelines.  The  antimicrobial 
agents  tested  and  their  corresponding  concentrations 
were as follows: nalidixic acid (30 μg), ciprofloxacin (15 
μg), erythromycin (15 μg), tetracycline (15 μg), strep-
tomycin  (30  μg),  gentamicin  (10  μg),  amoxicillin  (30 
μg), ampicillin (10 μg), chloramphenicol (30 μg), and 
enrofloxacin  (10  μg).  After  incubating  the  inoculated 
plate aerobically at 42°C for 48 h in a microaerophilic 
atmosphere,  the  susceptibility  of  the  Campylobacter 
spp. to each antimicrobial agent was measured and the 
results were interpreted in accordance with interpretive 
criteria provided by NCCLS (2003). Staphylococcus au-
reus and Escherichia coli were used as quality control 
organisms  in  antimicrobial  susceptibility  determina-
tion.

Statistical Analysis

Data were transferred to a Microsoft Excel spread-
sheet  (Microsoft  Corp.,  Redmond,  WA)  for  analysis. 
Using SPSS 16.0 statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chica-
go, IL), a χ2 test and Fisher’s exact 2-tailed test analy-
sis were performed and differences were considered sig-
nificant at values of P < 0.05.

RESULTS

Using  cultural  techniques,  186  of  336  carcasses 
(55.4%)  were  positive  for  Campylobacter  spp.  (Table 
2). No significant differences (P > 0.05) were present 
between the number of Campylobacter spp. isolated af-
ter defeathering and after evisceration stages. However, 
the number of positive samples increased significantly 
20 min after the chilling period started and decreased 
significantly after the chilling period completed (P < 
0.05). The number of C. jejuni isolated from carcasses 
in each processing line stage and in the chiller tank wa-
ter was significantly higher than C. coli (P < 0.05).

Significantly  more  chicken  carcass  samples  were 
found to contain Campylobacter spp. by the PCR assay 
than the cultural method (P < 0.05; Table 2). Overall, 
186 carcasses samples were positive for Campylobacter 
spp. using both the cultural method and the PCR as-
say. The PCR assay could identify 27 Campylobacter-
contaminated carcass samples that were negative using 
the cultural method.

Table 3 summarizes the resistance pattern of Campy-
lobacter  isolates  to  10  antimicrobial  agents  tested  in 
this  study.  Of  the  198  Campylobacter  isolates  tested, 
92.9% (n = 178) were resistant to one or more antimi-
crobial agents. A high proportion of the Campylobacter

nalidixic acid and to a lesser extent to enrofloxacin. All 
Campylobacter isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. 
Campylobacter coli isolates were susceptible to erythro-
mycin, amoxicillin, and chloramphenicol.

DISCUSSION

In this study, Campylobacter-contaminated carcasses 
were detected in all 4 sites along the processing line in 
a commercial poultry processing plant in southwestern 
Iran.  The  frequencies  of  contaminated  carcasses  with 
Campylobacter spp. after defeathering and after eviscer-
ation found in this study (54.8 and 51.2%, respectively) 
are in agreement with those reported by Franchin et al. 
(2007; 68 and 69.4%, respectively); however, they are 
lower than those observed by Vashin and Stoyanchev 
(2004; 92 and 100%, respectively). As previous studies 
(Vashin  and  Stoyanchev,  2004;  Franchin  et  al.,  2007; 
Son et al., 2007) and our study showed, no significant 
differences  were  found  between  the  frequency  of  con-
taminated carcasses with Campylobacter spp. after de-
feathering  and  after  evisceration.  This  finding  raises 
the possibility that evisceration is not the main factor 
responsible for cross-contamination. However, because 
rupture of the viscera with extravasations of intestinal 
content is always possible during the evisceration stage, 
the processes preceding evisceration such as defeather-

ing and scalding should be controlled to reduce Campy-
lobacter contamination.

A significant increase in the number of Campylobacter 
spp. isolates was noted in the carcass samples obtained 
20 min after the chilling stage started. This finding sug-
gests that the chiller is probably the main source of the 
cross-contamination. This was further supported by the 
high number of Campylobacter isolates detected in the 
chiller tank water. Our results showed that the number 
of  contaminated  carcasses  was  significantly  decreased 
24  h  after  the  chilling  stage  completed;  however,  the 
complete  elimination  of  the  agent  was  not  achieved. 
It  has  been  shown  that  the  number  of  contaminated 
carcasses can be reduced by stressors such as drying of 
the skin surface or chilling (Newell et al., 2001; Alter 
et  al.,  2005;  Son  et  al.,  2007).  The  ability  to  survive 
under such environmental stressors is dependent on the 
presence and expression of several stress response genes 
(Newell et al., 2001).

In  our  study  C.  jejuni  was  far  more  common  than 
C. coli. Campylobacter jejuni has been reported to be 
the most frequent species recovered from poultry (Jør-
gensen et al., 2002) and poultry carcasses (Son et al., 
2007; Rahimi and Tajbakhsh, 2008).

Antibiotic susceptibility test results of this study in-
dicated that there is an overall increase in the resistance 
of Campylobacter to tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and na-
lidixic acid. Results of this study are comparable to the 
results reported by others (Ge et al., 2003; Yildirim et 
al., 2005; Andersen et al., 2006; Taremi et al., 2006). 
The  widespread  use  of  antibiotics  as  supplements  for 
prophylaxis  and  growth  promotion  has  promoted  the 
selection of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial strains at 
the farm level during poultry production. High antimi-
crobial resistance rates to ciprofloxacin and tetracycline 
observed  in  this  study  might  be  due  to  the  fact  that 
during  the  past  decade  enrofloxacin,  which  is  closely 
related  to  ciprofloxacin,  and  tetracycline  have  been 
commonly used in veterinary medicine in Iran. Because 
campylobacteriosis  is  transmitted  primarily  through 
food, particularly poultry meat, the presence of antimi-
crobial-resistant  Campylobacter  in  raw  meat  products 
has important public health implications, especially in 
developing countries where there is widespread and un-
controlled use of antibiotics (Hart and kariuki, 1998). 
Therefore, the use of in vitro susceptibility testing of 
Campylobacter may take on greater importance in en-
suring rapid and appropriate management of patients 
with foodborne campylobacteriosis.

In this study, Campylobacter was better detected by 
the PCR assays than the cultural method. This could 
be due to the higher analytical and diagnostic sensitivi-
ties of the PCR assays. However, care must be taken 
to  avoid  false-positive  results  arising  from  DNA  con-
tamination, as well as false-negative results caused by 
inhibitory  substances  in  foods  or  enrichment  broths. 
Because  the  possibilities  for  amplicon  contamination 
were minimized by separation of the preparation and 
amplification-detection laboratories and the blank con-

trols were negative, false-positive results due to ampli-
cants are unlikely to have occurred.

In conclusion, the results of this study showed a high 
prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in poultry carcasses 
in  a  major  poultry  processing  plant  in  Ahvaz,  Iran. 
Campylobacter  spp.  was  isolated  from  the  initial  pro-
cessing steps to the final products. Most of the isolates 
were  antimicrobial-resistant  strains.  Contamination 
of  poultry  carcasses  with  Campylobacter  spp.  during 
processing constitutes a risk for consumers, especially 
from consumption of undercooked or postcooking con-
taminated  chicken  products.  Therefore,  the  incidence 
of  Campylobacter  spp.  in  chicken  products  should  be 
reduced by increasing biosafety measures during rear-
ing  on  the  chicken  farm,  transportation,  preslaughter 
operations,  and  during  the  processing  of  the  poultry 
carcasses.
