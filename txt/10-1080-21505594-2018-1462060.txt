Running title: mcr-1 in healthy broilers in Pakistan 

Letter to the Editor 

Polymyxins, like colistin (polymyxin E), are a group of cationic antimicrobial 

cyclic polypeptide, which have been extensively-used as prophylactic feed additives 

in animal production since the 1960s (1). A strong association has especially been 

drawn between antimicrobial use and resistance in poultry and pig farms (2-5). The 

advent and rise of multi-drug resistant bacteria has now prompted the re-introduction 

of colistin as a last-resort treatment option in human medicine (6, 7). However, the 

recent emergence and diversity of plasmid-borne mobile colistin resistance 

determinants (mcr-1 to mcr-5) in Enterobacteriaceae has severely challenged its use 

in a clinical setting (8-12). In the past two years, mcr-1 has been detected in over 40 

countries across 5 of 7 continents worldwide (13-15). Except rare cases of 

chromosomally-integrated mcr-1 (16, 17), its prevalent transmission relies on the 

transfer by diversified plasmids of different replication incompatibilities (18, 19). 

 

Mechanistically, the mcr-1 gene that encodes phosphoethanolamine 

transferase mediates the modification of the lipopolysaccharide layer (LPS) of the 

outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria through the addition of 

phosphoethanolamine (PEA) to the 1 (or 4′)-phosphate position of lipid A moieties 

(20, 21). This reduces the affinity of polymyxin antibiotics to their primary target, the 

 

2 

       LPS layer. Since its discovery during routine surveillance in China (8), increasingly-

accumulated evidence suggested the presence of mcr-1-bearing bacteria in food 

producing animals and humans across the world. To the best of our knowledge, the 

leading two types of mcr-1-harboring plasmids referred to IncI2 (8, 18, 22, 23) and 

IncX4 (24-26), have greatly facilitated global dissemination of mcr-1 colistin 

resistance (14, 27). In Pakistan, the mcr-1 gene has been identified in Escherichia 

coli (E. coli) isolates from human (28), wildlife (29) and a broiler suffering from 

colibacillosis (30). However, little is known about the prevalence of mcr-1 and its 

genetic environment in commensal E. coli isolates from poultry in Pakistan. 

 

           From December 2016 to January 2017, cloacal swabs from a total of 100 

healthy broiler chicken were obtained from four commercial farms (n=25 each) in the 

Faisalabad region of Pakistan. To screen the colistin resistant E. coli, all the samples 

were seeded directly onto MacConkey agar supplemented with 4 μg/ml of colistin 

and were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. Of 100 birds, colistin resistant E. coli were 

found in only 8 (8%) samples. A single colony of E. coli was selected per sample and 

identified using API 20E biochemical strips (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France). The 

presence of mcr-1 gene was confirmed among all 8 E. coli isolates by conventional 

PCR as we recently conducted (19, 31). Subsequently, the minimum inhibitory 

concentration (MIC) of colistin among these strains was tested by micro-dilution 

according to the guidelines of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (32, 33). 

The mcr-1-positive E. coli gave MIC of colistin between 2-8 μg/ml (Table 1). 

Plasmids were extracted from mcr-1-positive E. coli using alkaline lysis method. To 

elucidate the genetic context of mcr-1 on these plasmids, the conventional multiplex 

PCR with 7 primer sets was performed (Table S1) as we recently described (3, 19). 

The plasmids isolated from the different strains had unexpectedly similar PCR 

profiles with the exception of pPK112 which lacks the tnpA loci (Fig. 1B). Genetic 

 

3 

       context of mcr-1 shows that all the plasmids lack the insertion element ISApl1 (Fig. 

1A), which has been responsible for insertion of mcr-1 in previous studies (34). Also, 

these plasmids (Fig. 1A) are identical to the mcr-1-carrying plasmid pE15017 

isolated in China (19, 22). These bacteria were subjected to multi-locus sequence 

typing analyses with the Warwick method (http://mlst.warwick.ac.uk/mlst/). Diversified 

sequence types were detected, namely, ST10, ST2847, ST155, ST361 and ST6395. 

Evidently, all strains belonged to different STs with the exception of two strains of 

ST361 (Table 1). Despite that none of these STs have been reported from Pakistan 

in the past, ST10 and ST155 have been reported in mcr-1-harboring E. coli isolated 

from chicken in China (17, 35).  

 

Subsequently, a representative mcr-1-carrying plasmid pPK105 (Table 1) was 

subjected to whole genome sequencing using the method of Illumina HiSeq X-ten. 

The plasmid sequences were annotated by RAST, and the genome maps were 

drawn with the Circos program. As a result, the genome size of pPK105 was 

determined to be 60.499 kb (Acc. no.: MG808035, Fig. 2A), encoding hundreds of 

open reading frames with a GC content of 42.3%. Unlike the prevalent IncX4 type 

plasmid reported in Pakistan, Plasmid Finder at the web server 

(https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/PlasmidFinder/) indicated that pPK105 is a member 

of IncI2-type plasmid family (Fig. 2B). Notably, mcr-1 is the only resistance gene 

detected in pPK105 (Fig. 2B). It is quite different from the scenarios observed in the 

other mcr-1-containing Pakistan isolate coharboring ESBL (extended-spectrum β-

lactamase gene) and heavy-metal resistance. Although that ISApl1 sequence is 

missing, pPK105 retains the two conjugative genes vir and pil (Fig. 2). Intriguingly, 

we noticed that the mcr-1 gene in pPK105 is next to a sdrl gene, a serine-aspartate 

repeat surface protein known to bind collagen (Fig. 2B). However, its relevance 

 

4 

       remains unclear. Nevertheless, it has been shown earlier that ISApl1 transposon 

element is highly unstable in IncI2 plasmid (36). 

 

For further investigation, the chemical modification of lipid A by the mcr-1 

protein product MCR-1, the bacterial LPS was extracted as we conducted earlier (20, 

37) and then subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight 

mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (38). In comparison to E. coli MG1655 (m/z 

1796.29, Fig. 3A), a shift in the predominant lipid A species (m/z 1920.136, Fig. 3A) 

was observed in the mcr-1-expressing PK105 strain (mass is close to 123) 

corresponding to the addition of a PEA moiety (Fig. 3B). This new peak corresponds 

to a single modification that may occur at either the 1 or the 4’ position (Fig. 3B). 

This highlighted that surface remodeling by the mcr-1-encoding 

phosphoethanolamine transferase contributes to the resultant colistin resistance (14). 

 

The discovery of the mcr-1 gene, prompted a shift in focus from chromosomal 

mutations causing colistin-resistance to a transmissible plasmid-borne colistin 

resistance determinant. In addition to clinical isolates in humans, antimicrobial 

surveillance programs in Europe have identified mcr-1 in commensal bacterial 

populations from broilers, pigs and turkeys (39). This study shows a similar 

threatening scenario in the Faisalabad region of Pakistan where high rates of mcr-1 

positive E. coli were identified in healthy broilers. Retrospectively, the discovery of 

diverse clonal backgrounds of E. coli harboring the plasmid-borne mcr-1 is similar to 

scenarios observed earlier in Chinese poultry.  

 

 

5 

       Similarly, data on global population structure of mcr-1-positive E. coli 

showed large diversity in STs but limited plasmid types, particularly with regional 

spread of IncHI2 plasmids in Europe and IncI2 in Asia (14). This indicated the 

possible spread of a single mcr-1 colistin resistance gene across large geographical 

distances. It seems likely that farm animals act as a reservoir for the genetic diversity 

of mcr-1 (40).

Figure 3 MALDI-TOF MS analyses of lipid A pools of E. coli strains with (or 

 

without) mcr-1 

 

A. MS profile of the LPS-lipid A in the negative control strain E. coli MG1655  

B. MS spectrum of the LPS-lipid A in PK105, a representative strain of E. coli 

carrying mcr-1. A single modification may occur at the 1 (or 4’) position. The 

position indicated here is suggestive (20).
