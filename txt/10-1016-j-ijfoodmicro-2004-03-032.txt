Abstract

Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) isolated from raw beef samples in northern Palestine during a 1-year period were
characterized for virulence genes by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and screened for their antibiotic resistance. STEC
was identified in 44 (14.7%) of 300 raw beef samples. Twelve (27.3%) of the STEC isolates were serotype O157. Nine of those
were isolated during summer. The majority of STEC isolates (70.5%) harbored both stx1 and stx2 genes, while the others
harbored either stx1 or stx2. High levels of resistance against different antimicrobial agents were detected. Resistance to at least
three drugs was found in 55% of the isolates.

1. Introduction

Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) have
been implicated as the causative agent
in several
human diseases including mild nonbloody or severe
bloody diarrhea (hemorrhagic colitis), hemolytic ure-
mic syndrome (HUS) and renal failure (Paton and
Paton, 1998; Wong et al., 2000). Cattle are considered
to be the principal natural reservoir of this pathogen
(Gansheroff and O’Brien, 2000), but strains of this
pathogen are also prevalent
in the gastrointestinal
tracts of other domestic animals, particularly rumi-
nants (Beutin et al., 1993). Consumption of foods of
bovine origin, particularly raw or undercooked ground

beef products and raw milk contaminated with bovine
feces, has been associated with large food poisoning
outbreaks in which this organism was identified as the
etiologic agent (WHO, 1997). In Palestine, an out-
break due to STEC infection has been reported
(Adwan et al., 2002), but the sources of these cases
have not been identified. The objective of this study
was to determine the prevalence of STEC in raw beef
samples in Northern Palestine, as this has not been
investigated previously.

2. Materials and methods

Samples of meat from beef carcass surfaces were
purchased from local butchers’ shops in northern
Palestine between 1st December 2001 and 30th No-
vember 2002, with 75 samples being obtained during

each 3-month season. Fifteen grams of each sample
were homogenized with 135 ml of trypticase soy broth
(TSB, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The homogenate
was incubated overnight at 37 jC. A portion of the
TSB broth was spread on a plate of eosin methylene
blue agar (EMB, Defco Laboratories, Detroit, MI,
USA), which was incubated overnight at 37 jC. At
least 10 E. coli-like colonies were picked from the
plate and were suspended in 0.5 ml of sterile distilled
water. The suspension was boiled for 10 min. Follow-
ing centrifugation of the boiled suspension at
12,000  g for 2 min, the supernatant was tested by
a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the
presence of stx1 and stx2 genes, as described previ-
ously (Paton and Paton, 1998). Isolates were con-
firmed as E. coli by the API 20E system (bioMe´rieux,
Marcy L’Etoile, France) and tested for sorbitol fer-
mentation on sorbitol MacConkey agar (SMAC,
Oxoid, Hampshire, England). The O157 antigen of
isolates was confirmed by agglutination with a spe-
cific latex reagent (Oxoid).

The STEC strains were tested for antibiotic resis-
tance using the disk diffusion method (Bauer et al.,
1966). Antibiotic disks (Oxoid) used were chloram-
phenicol (30 Ag), tetracycline (30 Ag), kanamycin (30
Ag), amikacin (30 Ag), ceftriaxone (30 Ag), norflox-
acin (10 Ag), ampicillin (10 Ag), streptomycin (10 Ag),
gentamicin (10 Ag), ceftazidime (10 Ag), and cipro-
floxacin (5 Ag). Zones of inhibition were determined
in accordance with procedures of the National Com-
mittee for Clinical Laboratory Standard (NCCLS),
1999).

3. Results and discussion

STEC were identified in 44 (14.7%) of the 300
beef samples. Twelve (27.3%) of the STEC isolates
were O157. All isolates that tested positive for the

O157 antigen carried the stx1 virulence gene and nine
carried the stx2 virulence gene. Twenty-two non-O157
isolates carried both stx1 and stx2 genes, whereas 10
isolates harbored only one or the other (Table 1). Nine
of the E. coli O157 were isolated during summer.

The antibiotic resistance profiles of the STEC
isolates are presented in Table 2. The most common
resistance was to tetracycline and/or streptomycin.
Resistance to ceftriaxone or ceftazidime was rare.
Only three isolates were sensitive to all 11 antibiotics.
Resistance to at least three drugs was found in 55% of
the isolates.

In this study, the majority of the STEC isolates
carried both stx1 and stx2 genes. These results were
consistent with a previous report from India, where
44.5% of the STEC isolates harbored both stx1 and
stx2 genes (Khan et al., 2002a). However, these results
were in contrast
to other studies from Germany,
France and Japan where STEC isolates usually carried
one or other of the stx genes (Akiba et al., 1999;
Schmidt et al., 1999; Pradel et al., 2001).

The STEC prevalence in of raw beef samples was
14.7%. If the immunomagnetic separation method had
been used, more accurate picture on STEC prevalence
could be achieved because of this method increases
the recovery of STEC from the selective enrichment
broth (Zhou et al., 2002). The prevalence of STEC in
beef samples reported for countries such as Belgium,
New Zealand, India and USA has ranged from 1.8%
to 50% (Pie’rard et al., 1997; Brooks et al., 2001;
Khan et al., 2002b; Samadpour et al., 2002). The total
STEC prevalence on samples from beef carcasses has

been reported as 71.9% before evisceration and 10.1%
after processing (Arthur et al., 2002).

Results showed that 4% fresh meat beef samples
were contaminated with serotype O157. This result is
in agreement with data from China which showed that
STEC O157 strains were isolated from 5% of beef
(Zhou et al., 2002). Other studies reported prevalence
of E. coli O157 in beef which ranged from 1.1% to
13.4% (Chapman et al., 1997, 2000, 2001). Most of
these E. coli O157 strains were isolated during sum-
mer (Chapman et al., 1997; Van Donkersgoed et al.,
1999; Arthur et al., 2002). Thus, carcass contamina-
tion with STEC may be much less frequent at other
times of the year (Arthur et al., 2002).

The antimicrobial susceptibility results of the
STEC isolates are a cause for concern as more than
50% of the isolates were resistant to three or more
drugs. Similar incidences of resistance have been
reported for isolates obtained elsewhere (Maidhof et
al., 2002; Khan et al., 2002a). The high incidence in
this study may be due in part to selective pressure
resulting from incorporation of antibiotics into animal
feeds. Two isolates of STEC O157 showed the same
patterns of resistance (data not shown). This may have
been due to cross contamination of meat by contact
with workers hands or tools during evisceration of or
hide removal from carcasses, or perhaps by direct
contact between carcasses during transport.

To our knowledge this is the first survey of the
prevalence of STEC in raw beef for human consump-
tion in Palestine. As expected, beef in Palestine is
contaminated by this pathogen as in other countries.
Detection of either stx1 or stx2 genes does not neces-
sary entail that the strains are pathogenic to man.
Thus, expansion of this study to include genes encod-
ing putative accessory virulence factors, such as
intimin or the plasmid-encoded hemolysin (Arthur et
al., 2002), is necessary to further evaluate significance
of STEC strains in human disease in Palestine.
