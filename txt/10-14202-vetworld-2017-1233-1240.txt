Abstract

Aim:  Shiga  toxin-producing  Escherichia  coli  (STEC)  represent  a  severe  public  health  issue  worldwide,  causing  life-
threatening  diseases  in  the  human  gastrointestinal  tract. This  study  aimed  to  determine  the  occurrence  of  virulent  and 
antibiotic-resistant STEC in retail meat and milk products and human stool samples and to characterize the genes encoding 
for virulence and antibiotic resistance among the identified STEC isolates.
Materials and Methods: A total of 260 food samples were randomly collected from retail markets in different localities of 
El Giza Governorate, Egypt. 50 stool specimens were obtained from children that had diarrhea at Embaba Fever Hospital. 
All collected samples were initially subjected to bacteriological examination and serotyping, and then subsequently, the 
isolates were exposed to polymerase chain reaction application and sequencing for the identification of the virulence-related 
genes. Finally, the virulent STEC isolates were tested for antibiotic susceptibility.
Results: Serotyping of the 76 biochemically identified isolates showed that 18 were STEC with a predominance of non-
O157 (16) while 2 O157:K-serotype was detected only in one food and one human isolate. Molecular identification of the 
virulence genes illustrated that the minced meat showed the highest prevalence of STEC (8%) as compared to the other 
food  products.  In  the  humans,  the  O157  was  the  only  serotype  that  expresses  the  Shiga  toxin-associated  gene  (eaeA). 
Antibiotic susceptibility test displayed that 13 of the 17 food and human isolates (76.47%) were resistant to cephalothin 
(KF30). 9 of the 13 cephalothin-resistant isolates harbor the β lactamase (blaTEM)-resistant gene. All isolates were sensitive to 
chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, and gentamicin. DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the stx2-positive 
minced meat isolate revealed a high genetic relatedness with beef minced meat from the USA and Australia.
Conclusion: This study showed the predominance of non-O157 among the identified isolates. Minced meat showed the 
highest prevalence of STEC as compared to the other food products, and this work illustrates the necessity to consider the 
food products as a potential source of the non-O157 STEC serotypes. DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed 
a high genetic relatedness with beef minced meat from the USA and Australia. This highlights the high probability of 
worldwide spread of such serotypes, signifying the importance of the one world concept.

Introduction

Escherichia coli (EC) is normally found as nor-
mal flora in the intestinal tract of human and warm-
blooded  animals,  but  some  strains  have  acquired 
pathogenic  or  toxigenic  virulence  factors  that  make 
them  virulent  for  human  and  animals  [1].  On  the 
basis of somatic (O), flagellar (H), and capsular (K) 
antigens, diarrheagenic EC is divided into six patho-
types:  Enteroaggregative,  enterohemorrhagic/Shiga 
toxin-producing  E.  coli  (STEC),  enteroinvasive,

enteropathogenic, enterotoxigenic, and diffuse adher-
ent (DAEC) [2].

STEC  represents  a  hazardous  public  health 
problem  worldwide  causing  various  human  gastro-
intestinal  tract  diseases,  including  watery  or  bloody 
diarrhea, and might develop life-threatening diseases, 
such as hemorrhagic colitis, thrombotic thrombocyto-
penic purpura, (TTP) and hemolytic-uremic syndrome 
(HUS), and the latter is characterized by thrombocyto-
penia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and acute 
renal failure [3]. The most important STEC serotypes 
which  have  been  associated  with  human  illness  are 
O157,  O111,  O26,  O103,  O113,  O91,  O117,  O118, 
O121, O145, O128, and O146 [4]. STEC infections 
are  mainly  foodborne  infections;  foods  of  high  risk 
for  transmission  are  meat  products  such  as  minced 
meat,  sausage,  hamburger  and  luncheon,  and  dairy 
products [5].

of  two  powerful  phage-encoded  cytotoxins  causing 
tissue  damage  in  humans  and  animals,  called  Shiga 
toxins or verotoxins (stx1 and stx2) [6]. In addition, 
a number of accessory virulence factor genes such as 
the intimin (eae) and the enterohemolysin (hly) have 
been described [7].

Treatment  of  EC  infection  has  been  increas-
ingly  complicated  worldwide  by  the  emergence  of 
resistance  to  most  antibiotics. Among  these,  β  lact-
ams  (e.g.  penicillins,  cephalosporins,  cephamycins, 
and  carbapenems),  tetracycline,  and  aminoglyco-
sides (streptomycin) are of particular interest [8]. The 
inappropriate use of antibiotics in animal production 
brought up resistance in commensal and pathogenic 
bacterial strains. It has been suggested that commen-
sal EC might represent a reservoir of resistance genes 
for  other  bacteria  [9].  One  of  the  important  mecha-
nisms  used  by  antibiotic-resistant  EC  is  enzymes 
which  hydrolyze  β  lactam  antibiotics  [10]  such  as 
extended  spectrum  β-lactamases  (ESBLs).  Many 
ESBLs are members of TEM (named after the patient 
temoneira) [11] which are capable to hydrolyze peni-
cillins and first-generation cephalosporins [12].

Resistance  to  tetracycline  is  encoded  by  more 
than 40 genes (tet-genes), and they are divided into 
11 classes, with a majority of classes (60%) encod-
ing  for  membrane-associated  efflux  proteins.  These 
efflux  pumps  selectively  transport  tetracycline  from 
the  cytosol  to  the  periplasm,  thereby  limiting  the 
access of tetracycline to the ribosomes in the cell [13]. 
Tet (A) is the most common efflux pump type found in 
commensal and clinical EC animal isolates [14]. The 
other resistance commonly detected in EC was against 
streptomycin  and  is  mainly  attributed  to  aadA  type 
gene  variants  (aadA1,  aadA2,  and  aadA5)  [15,16]. 
Hence, the current study was aimed to determine the 
prevalence  of  STEC  and  to  detect  virulence  genes 
(stx1, stx2, eaeA, and hlyA) as well as resistance deter-
minants (blaTEM, aadA2, and Tet A) among the STEC 
isolates from examined retail meat and milk products 
and human fecal samples collected from fever/public 
hospital in Egypt.
Materials and Methods
Ethical approval

Ethical  clearance  to  use  human  subjects  was 
obtained from the designated health facility (National 
Research Centre, Giza, Egypt). Written consent was 
obtained  from  each  person  on  information  of  the 
use  of  samples.  This  study  was  conducted  in  Giza 
Governorate, Egypt, at the period from January 2012 
to August 2016.
Collection of samples

A  total  of  200  meat  samples  including  minced 
meat  (n=50),  luncheon  (n=50),  sausage  (n=50), 
and beef burger (n=50), and 60 Karish cheese sam-
ples were collected from retail markets in randomly 
selected  localities  in  El  Giza  Governorate.  Fecal

samples were obtained from 50 hospitalized children 
with diarrhea at Embaba Fever Hospital.
Bacterial isolation

This  method  was  performed  according  to  the 
De Boer and Heuvelink [17]. Briefly, 25 g from each 
sample  were  transferred  to  tubes  containing  225  ml 
of  trypticase  soya  broth  (TSB,  Oxoid,  England), 
blended, and incubated at 37°C for 24 h in an incu-
bator (Sheldon MFG Inc., USA). A loopful from each 
of  the  previously  incubated  enrichment  broth  tubes 
was streaked over Eosin Methylene Blue agar (EMB, 
Oxoid, England) and Sorbitol McConkey agar plates 
(SMAC, Oxoid, England) and then incubated at 37°C 
for 24 h. Suspected colonies were stained with Gram 
stain and examined microscopically to detect Gram-
negative rods. The presumptive colonies were purified 
on agar slopes and were incubated at 37°C for 24 h for 
further identification.
Biochemical identification

Presumptive colonies were confirmed biochemi-
cally using GNB 12 A kit (Oxoid, England) for Gram-
negative bacilli.
Serotyping

The  identified  EC  isolates  were  serotyped  by 
slide agglutination test in the central laboratories of 
Ministry  of  Health  and  Population  (Cairo,  Egypt) 
using  standard  polyvalent  and  monovalent  EC  anti-
sera according to Edwards and Ewing [18].
Antibiotic sensitivity test

Confirmed  isolates  tested  using  disk  diffusion 
method  on  Muller-Hinton  agar  plates  (Oxoid)  for 
susceptibility  to  commonly  used  antibiotics  (Oxoid, 
UK),  amikacin  (AK30,  30  mcg),  amoxicillin/clavu-
lanic acid (AMC30, 20/10 mcg), ampicillin (AMP 10, 
10  mcg),  cefotaxime  (CTX30,  30  mcg),  ceftriaxone 
(CR30, 30 mcg), cephalothin (KF30, 30 mcg), chlor-
amphenicol  (C30,  30  mcg),  ciprofloxacin  (CIP5, 
5  mcg),  gentamicin  (GN10,  10  mcg),  streptomycin 
(S10, 10 mcg), and tetracycline (TE30, 30 mcg). The 
results were interpreted according to CLSI [19].
Molecular identification of STEC isolates
DNA extraction

Genomic DNA was extracted from pure EC colo-
nies using QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) 
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification

Primers for the studied virulence and antibiotic 
resistance genes (Midland Certified Reagent Company 
Oligos, USA). The PCR mixture for a total reaction 
volume of 25 μl consisted of 6 μl DNA template from 
each  isolate,  12.5  μl  of  Emerald  PCR  Master  Mix 
(Takara, Japan), 1 μl of 20 pmol of each primer, and 
4.5 μl of PCR grade water. The reactions were per-
formed  in  T3  thermal  cycler  (Biometra,  Germany) 
under different conditions for each primer set accord-
ing to the previous studies as stated in Table-1 [20-26]. 
1234

Available at www.veterinaryworld.org/Vol.10/October-2017/12.pdfThe PCR products (15μl each) were electrophoresed 
on 1.5% agarose gel (Applichem, Germany, GmbH). 
A 100 bp DNA Ladder (Qiagen, Germany) was used 
to determine the size of the product. The gel was pho-
tographed  using  gel  documentation  system  (Alpha 
Innotech, Biometra, Germany), and the data were ana-
lyzed using computer software.
Sequence analysis

The  amplicons  of  stx1  and  stx2  were  purified 
using QIA quick PCR Product extraction kit. (Qiagen 
Inc., Valencia CA) and then sequenced in Macrogen 
Company  (Korea)  using  Applied  Biosystems  3130 
automated  DNA  Sequencer  (USA).  The  nucleotide 
sequences were analyzed using BioEdit 7.0.4.1 pro-
gram. The obtained nucleotide sequences were com-
pared  with  those  available  in  public  domains  using 
NCBI-BLAST  server  and  were  deposited  in  the 
GenBank Database. Sequence alignments and phylo-
genetic comparisons of the sequences for the exam-
ined genes were performed using MegAlign module 
of Lasergene DNAStar software.

The  STEC  isolates  were  sequenced  for  stx2 
gene, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed based 
on  alignment  with  nine  stx2  genes  retrieved  from 
NCBI  database  that  showed  high  homology  with 
our  sequence.  The  phylogenetic  analysis  demon-
strates that the sequence of the minced meat isolates 
obtained in the present study (KY884001) was clus-
tered with other two beef minced meat E. coli isolated 
from Australia (AF500193) and USA (GQ429166.1), 
indicating  that  our  isolate  might  be  the  source  of 
these two isolates. Interestingly, our isolate shared a

responsible for serious outbreaks worldwide [27,28]. 
In this study, the overall prevalence of STEC in the 
examined meat products was 3% (6 out of 200) which 
is  higher  than  0.3  recorded  by  Loukiadis  et  al. [29] 
from France and similar to Hessain et al. [30] in Saudi 
Arabia.  Other  studies  reported  higher  prevalence  in 
meat products that range from 9.38% in Egypt [31] to 
11.6% in Romania [32]. These variations in the prev-
alence rate of STEC might be explained by the type 
of samples examined their source as well as a method 
of detection. In this regard, in this study, the highest 
percentage of STEC was found in minced meat (8%, 
4 out of 50) as compared to beef burger and sausage 
that  showed  the  presence  of  one  STEC  isolate.  In 
contrast, the luncheon isolates were STEC negative. 
Raw meat was shown to contain high prevalence of 
STEC  [33,34]  which  might  explain  their  presence 
in sausage and beef burger since these products are

prepared from raw meat and not cooked but preserved 
by lactic acid fermentation.

One of the most popular Egyptian diets is cheese 
due to its high protein content, low fat, and price [35]. 
Cheese,  especially  those  made  from  raw  milk  like 
Karish,  has  been  incriminated  in  recent  foodborne 
outbreaks [36]. Our results showed contamination of 
Karish cheese samples with STEC in a percentage of 
1.7% (1 out of 60) that is similar to other studies per-
formed in Egypt [37].

Like other studies performed in Egypt [31,38], 
the non-O157 serotypes (O125, O26, O111, O145, and 
O103) were most commonly present in food products. 
The  O157  serotype  was  isolated  only  from  sausage 
but not from the other food products. This finding is 
similar to other reports [33,39] that demonstrated the 
inability  to  isolate  the  O157  serotype  from  minced 
meat, burger, and luncheon.

Molecular identification of the virulence genes 
confirmed the previous report [40] that stx1 predomi-
nates over stx2 in STEC isolates from food products. In 
this study, the stx1, stx2, and eaeA genes were harbored 
mainly by minced meat STEC isolates. This is consis-
tent with an Indian study performed by Sethulekshmi 
et al. [34] and in contrast with Dambrosio et al. [41] 
who stated that none of the meat STEC isolates har-
bored  stx1  or  stx2  genes.  Interestingly,  one  of  the 
two Karish STEC isolates carried both stx1 and eaeA 
genes.  However,  the  intimin  gene  (eaeA)  acts  as  an 
accessory factor that is thought to enhance the viru-
lence of STEC, and some STEC strains not harboring 
eaeA have been shown to cause human illnesses [42]. 
None  of  our  STEC  isolates  carries  hlyA  gene,  and 
this agrees with Abd El-Tawab et al. [43] and Khatib 
et al. [44]. This might be due to the presence of iutA 
gene encoding aerobactin which compensates for the 
absence of hlyA gene [45]. Further study is needed to 
examine whether our isolates carry iutA gene instead 
of hlyA because the isolates usually have either iutA or 
hly, but rarely both genes [45].

The public health importance of EC was exam-
ined  in  diarrheic  children.  Like  in  meat  products, 
the non-O157 was the common serotype isolated from 
the diarrheic children in the present study. Although 
the O157 is the most frequent serotype causing human 
illnesses, there is rising evidence that non-O157 sero-
types  are  linked  to  human  outbreaks  [46,47].  Our 
Veterinary World, EISSN: 2231-0916 

results  provide  additional  evidence  for  the  possible 
association of non-O157 serotypes with clinical dis-
ease  in  humans.  Furthermore,  the  human  isolates 
expressed neither stx1 nor stx2 genes except for one 
isolate of the O157 serotype were found to carry eaeA 
gene.

Examination of antibiotic susceptibility patterns 
of the animal and human isolates revealed that 17 of 
the 18 serotyped STEC isolates exhibited resistance 
to one or more antibiotic agents, and the majority of 
them (13 of the 17 [76.47%]) were resistant to ceph-
alothin  (KF30)  irrespective  to  their  origin  (food  or 
humans).  Among  the  13  KF30-resistant  STEC  iso-
lates, nine harbor the blaTEM-resistant genes which 
explain the resistance to cephalothin as it is a β-lac-
tam first-generation cephalosporin which gets hydro-
lyzed  by  the  TEM  β-lactamase  [48].  Interestingly, 
two  of  the  KF30-resistant  strains  were  also  tetracy-
cline resistant with one of them carry tetA resistance 
gene.  Resistance  to  cephalothin  and  tetracycline  in 
EC strains isolated from different sources is consis-
tent with other studies performed on different type of 
samples worldwide [49-53]. This highlights the wide-
spread and lengthy use of both antibiotics for the treat-
ment of human diseases and as a growth promoter in 
animals. Interestingly, all isolates were susceptible to 
chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, and genta-
micin, signifying the effective use of such antibiotics 
in the control of infection with STEC in animals and 
humans. This agrees with the study of Jiao et al. [54] 
and Jeyasanta et al. [55] who reported that amikacin 
and ciprofloxacin are among the effective antibiotics 
used to treat EC infection.

Strikingly,  the  Aada2  resistance  gene  was  not 
detected in any of the streptomycin-resistant isolates, 
suggesting that such resistance might be mediated by 
other yet undescribed genes [56]. The present results 
of  antibiotic  susceptibility  agree  and  disagree  with 
other studies, pointing to the variability in antibiotic 
resistance  pattern  according  to  the  type  of  isolates, 
time,  and  development  of  multiple  drug-resistant 
EC [57].

Phylogenetic analysis of the stx2 gene from our 
minced  meat  STEC  isolate  showed  a  high  genetic 
relatedness  with  stx2  genes  from  beef  minced  meat 
STEC  isolates  from  Australia  and  the  USA.  This 
might be due to the fact that the minced meat samples 
1237

Moreover, the current stx2 gene shared a common ori-
gin with those from different types of samples such 
as Indian fish, Chinese yak, Swiss bovine feces, and 
German human stools. Our results highlight the possi-
ble transmission of E.Ccarrying such gene worldwide 
through trade.
Conclusion

In  this  study,  minced  meat  showed  the  highest 
prevalence  of  STEC  as  compared  to  the  other  food 
products. Antibiotic susceptibility test displayed that 
majority  of  the  food,  and  human  isolates  (76.47%) 
were  resistant  to  cephalothin.  DNA  sequencing  and 
phylogenetic  analysis  of  the  stx2-positive  minced 
meat isolate revealed a high genetic relatedness with 
beef minced meat from the USA and Australia. This 
highlights the high probability of worldwide spread of 
such serotypes, signifying the importance of the one 
world concept.
Significance statements

This study focused on the public health impor-
tance of the meat and meat products (minced meat and 
sausage) as a source of STEC, especially non-O157:H7 
and causing human infections and outbreaks. In this 
study, all STECs were 100% susceptible to chloram-
phenicol,  ciprofloxacin,  amikacin,  and  gentamicin, 
signifying that these antibiotics could be of choice to 
be used in control of infectious diseases of STEC in 
human. On the other hand, the presence of antimicro-
bial-resistant EC may represent a reservoir of resis-
tance genes for other bacteria such as beta-lactamase 
blaTEM, TetA, and aadA2 and therefore decrease the 
efficacy  of  treatment  of  other  bacterial  infections. 
DNA  sequencing  and  phylogenetic  analysis  of  stx2 
gene from our minced meat STEC isolate with avail-
able sequences in NCBI revealed that these genes are 
closely  related  to  that  isolated  from  different  coun-
tries,  especially Australia  and  USA,  which  increase 
the role of importation of meat and meat products in 
the transmission of EC carrying such gene worldwide.
