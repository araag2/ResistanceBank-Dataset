ABSTRACT 

 

Enteric  diseases  of  bacterial  origin  are  frequent  in  the  pig  industry,  of  particular  notoriety  are  the 
colibacillosis that mainly affect piglets and cause great damage to the swine industry worldwide. The aim 
of  the  study  was  to  analyze  phylogenetics,  to  detect  biofilm  production,  and  to  determine  antimicrobial 
resistance profile in 126 strains of  Escherichia coli isolated from swabs obtained from fragments of the 
small  intestines  of  235  healthy  pigs  killed  in  slaughterhouses  in  Pernambuco  (Brazil)  using  polymerase 
chain  reaction  (PCR),  adherence  to  microplates  test  and  disc  diffusion  technique.  Of  the  analyzed 
samples, 88.10% (111/126) were classified in phylogenetic group B1; 4.76% (6/126) in group D; 3.97% 
(5/126)  in  group  B2  and,  3.17%  (4/126)  in  group  A.  Antimicrobial  resistance  rates  observed  were: 
lincomycin  100%  (126/126),  erythromycin  100%  (126/126),  chlortetracycline  94.44%  (119/126), 
cephalothin  51.59%  (65/126),  ampicillin  38.89%  (49/126),  sulfamethoxazole  +  trimethoprim  37.3% 
(47/126), ciprofloxacin 19.84% (25/126), norfloxacin 14.29% (18/126), gentamicin 8.73% (11/126) and, 
chloramphenicol  5.55%  (7/126).  Multiple  antibiotic  resistance  (MAR)  ranged  from  0.2  to  0.9.  Of  the 
strains  tested  46.03%  (58/126)  produced  biofilm,  and  99.21%  (125/126)  of  the  strains  exhibited  multi-
resistance. Further studies are required to elucidate the importance of each phylogenetic group in pigs and 
to prevent the propagation of multi-resistant E. coli strains.

of  16%  compared  to  2015,  demonstrating  the 
economic  importance  of  this  activity,  especially 
in  the  south  of  the  country  (ABPA,  2017).  The

participation  in  pork  production  and,  in  this 
context,  the  state  of  Pernambuco  has  been 
increasing its herd over the years (ABPA, 2017). 
Enteric  diseases  of  bacterial  origin,  such  as 
colibacillosis,  have  a  great  economic  impact  on 
the  pig  industry,  due  to  the  high  rates  of 
morbidity and mortality, as well as the sequels in 
the  gastrointestinal  tract  and  expenses  related  to 
antibiotic therapy (Menin et al., 2008).  
 
Colibacillosis  is  an  enteric  disease  that  mainly 
affects  neonatal  and  post-weaning  piglets.  It  is 
caused  by  toxigenic  strains  of  Escherichia  coli, 
which  is  one  of  the  main  causes  of  diarrhea 
among pigs (Zhang and Francis, 2010). 
 
Strains of Escherichia coli can be classified into 
four  main  phylogenetic  groups  (A,  B1,  B2  and 
D).  The  most  virulent  strains  belong  to  groups 
B2 
considered 
commensal  are  often  classified  in  groups  A  and 
B1 (Clermont et al., 2000; Moreno et al., 2006). 
 
Bacterial resistance to antimicrobials is a serious 
problem in both human and veterinary medicine. 
Rational  use  of  antimicrobial  drugs  must  be 
made  in  order  to  avoid  resistant  bacteria  in 
animals,  humans  or 
the  environment.

accumulation of antibiotic residues in the meat of 
the  animals,  which  will  later  be  consumed  by

and expose the natural microbiota to these agents

that  biofilm  cells  are  between  100  and  1000

problem  in  the  treatment  of  chronic  infections

In the Northeast of Brazil, data about the sanitary 
profile  of  pig  herds  are  scarce  and  there  is  no 
information  about  the  characterization  of  E.  coli 
strains in  herds. Therefore, the aim of this  study 
was  to  analyze  phylogenetically,  the  production 
of biofilm and determine the resistance profile of 
antimicrobials  among  E.  coli  strains  isolated 
from  pigs  killed  for  human  consumption  in 
slaughterhouses  in  the  state  of  Pernambuco, 
Brazil.  
 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 

The  present  study  was  submitted  to  the  Animal 
Rights  Ethics  Committee  of  the  Universidade 
Federal  Rural  de  Pernambuco  under  process 
number  23082.005013/2013-31  and 
it  was 
approved  under  license  number  032/2013  on 
April 29, 2013. 
 
In total, 126 Escherichia coli strains were used in 
the present study. The strains were isolated from 
swabs  obtained  from  fragments  of  the  small 
intestines  of  235  pigs.  These  fragments  were 
collected at the time of evisceration, during their 
slaughter  in  public  slaughterhouses,  with  one 
swab  for  each  animal.  These  swabs  were 
identified  and  stored  in  cool  boxes  containing 
recyclable ice before being sent to the Infectious 
Diseases Laboratory (LDIC) in the Universidade 
Federal  Rural  de  Pernambuco  (UFRPE),  where 
they were processed.  
 
In 
they  were  seeded  on 
MacConkey  agar  culture  media  (MERCK®, 
Jacarepaguá,  RJ,  Brazil)  and  incubated  at  37ºC 
for  24  to  48  hours.  Characteristic  strains  were 
submitted  to  Gram  staining  technique  and,  later, 
the  Gram-negative  samples  were  submitted  to 
biochemical  tests,  such  as  lactose  fermentation, 
d-manitol  fermentation,  acid  from  glucose  with 
gas, 
indole 
test,  Simmons 
production,  Voges-Proskauer 
citrate  and 
the 
biochemical  confirmation,  each  colony  was 
stored  in  cryovials  of  2mL,  containing  brain 
(MERCK®, 
heart 
Jacarepaguá, RJ, Brazil) and glycerol. They were 
then stored at -20ºC until its processing.  
 
The  phylogenetic  characterization  of  the  E.  coli 
strains  was 
the 
methodology  described  by  Clermont  et  al. 
(2000).  The  DNA  of  the  isolates  was  thermally

Before  performing  the  biofilm  production  tests, 
previously  frozen  strains  were  cultured 
in

the  next  steps.  Then,  biofilm  formation  was 
detected by testing the adherence to microplates, 
as  described  by  Merino  et  al.  (2009).  Optical 
density (OD) of the samples was determined by a 
microplate  reader  (Biochrom  Expert  Plus  - 
Asys®, Holliston, MA, USA) and measured with 
a  wavelength of  595nm.  All of the isolates  were 
tested in triplicate using the E. coli ATCC 35218 
strain as a positive control and the  Luria Bertani 
medium  (HIMEDIA®,  Curitiba,  PR,  Brasil)  as  a 
negative  control.  Based  on  the  arithmetic  mean 
of  the  OD  of  the  triplicates  of  the  isolates,  the 
OD  produced  by  each  isolate  was  obtained 
(ODi).  After  comparing  the  ODi  and  the  mean 
OD produced by the  negative control (ODc), the 
micro-organisms  were  grouped  as  follows:  non-
former of biofilm (ODi ≤ ODc); weak (ODc ≤ ODi

The  resistance  profile  of  the  antimicrobials  was 
determined  by 
the  disk  diffusion  method 
(Baccaro  et  al.,  2002).  This  involved  testing 
antimicrobials  commonly  used 
the  pig 
industry  (Costa  et  al.,  2006;  Drummond  and 
Perecmanis,  2013)  including:  ampicillin  (10µg);

DISCUSSION 

 

the 

In  the  present  study,  91.27%  (115/126)  of  the 
strains  analyzed  belonged  to  the  phylogenetic 
groups A or B1, which corroborates the  findings 
of  Wang  et  al.  (2010)  and  Mohamadi  et  al. 
(2015), who  used isolated strains of piglets  with 
diarrhea  and  healthy  ostrich,  respectively,  and 
found  a  greater  frequency  of 
isolates 
belonging to the phylogenetic groups considered 
commensal.  Previous  studies  with  isolates  of  E. 
coli  have  shown  that  the  pathogenic  strains 
isolated from pigs and cattle are mostly classified 
in  the  phylogenetic  groups  A  and  B1,  whereas 
isolates from poultry belong to groups A, B1 and 
D (Girardini et al., 2012, Mohamadi et al., 2015) 
and  human  isolates  mainly  belong  to  groups  A 
and B2 (Bailey et al., 2010). 
 
Although  several  authors  have  stated  that  the 
phylogenetic  groups  A  and  B1  are  commensal 
(Clermont  et  al.,  2000;  Moreno  et  al.,  2006; 
Moulin-Schouleur  et  al.,  2007),  Ramos  et  al. 
(2013) has shown that these phylogenetic groups 
are  more  common  among  strains  isolated  from 

pigs with diarrhea, suggesting that groups A and 
B1 have a greater pathogenic importance among 
pigs. 
 
According  to  Lay  et  al.  (2012),  it  is  essential  to 
perform  an  antibiogram  for  E.  coli,  considering 
ecological,  environmental  and  genetic  factors, 
due to the high frequency of  isolates resistant to 
the  majority  of  antimicrobials.  This  was 
observed  in  the  present  study,  in  which  99.21% 
(125/126)  of 
the  strains  exhibited  multi-
resistance,  which  is  a  similar  result  to  that 
obtained  by  Krewer  et  al.  (2012),  who  reported 
that  this  result  could  indicate  the  potential  for 
horizontal transfer of resistance genes.  
 
Mota  et  al.  (2005)  reported  that  high  rates  of 
multiple  resistance  to  antimicrobials  represent  a 
great  risk  to  public  health  by  hindering  the 
treatment  of  animal  and  human  diseases. 
According  to  the  same  authors,  in  different 
production systems of the region studied, there is 
indiscriminate  use  of  antimicrobials  without 
veterinary  supervision,  which  could  aggravate 
the multi-resistance situation.

erythromycin  and 
lincomycin,  while  also 
confirming  that  ciprofloxacin,  norfloxacin  and 
gentamicin  were  the  drugs  with  the  greatest  in

The 
for 
chloramphenicol  (5.55%)  in  the  present  study 
demonstrated 
tendency  of 
resistance to this drug in comparison to previous 
studies conducted in Brazil. Baccaro et al. (2002) 
recorded  97%  of  strains 
this 
antimicrobial when analyzing 600 E. coli isolates 
from  piglets  with  diarrhea  in  the  state  of  São 
Paulo.  Ten  years  later,  Krewer  et  al.  (2012) 
analyzed 62 isolates of  E. coli from  the  feces of 
pigs in the south of Brazil and found that 16.3% 
of  the  samples  were  resistant  to  this  active 
ingredient. This behavior could be explained by a 
determination  from  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture, 
Fishing  and  Supplies  (Normative  Instruction  no. 
38 from the 8th of May 2002), which prohibited 
the 
and 
commercialization 
chloramphenicol, 
nitrofurans  and  products  that  contained  these 
active  ingredients  for  use  in  veterinary  medical. 
This could have interrupted the selection cycle of 
resistant  strains,  as  witnessed  with  tetracyclines, 
which  are  widely  used  in  the  prophylaxis  of 
diarrhea and used as growth promoters in the pig 
industry.  
 
For the isolates analyzed in the present study, the 
MAR 
four 
phylogenetic groups, although it is expected that 
strains  from  animals  that  do  not  belong  to  the 
group B2 exhibit less virulence factors and more 
antimicrobial 
resistance,  which  would  be 
explained 
and 
individual characteristics of the host, as reported 
by Sabaté et al. (2008). 
 
Data referring to the production of biofilm by  E. 
coli  strains  isolated  from  animals  are  scarce 
(Melchior et al., 2006). However, its importance 
in the pig industry is well known, particularly as 
it  makes  biofilm  producing  microorganisms 
more resistant to the action of antimicrobials and 
disinfectants  (Reisner  et  al.,  2006).  The  results

(2011) who analyzed strains from bovine mastitis 
and  confirmed  that  100%  of  the  E.  coli  isolates 
tested  were  capable  of  producing  biofilm. 
However,  when  comparing  the  distribution  by 
phylogenetic  group,  the  results  are  similar  in 
terms  of  groups  A  and  B1  being  the  most 
common.  The  results  of  the  present  study  also 
differ  from  those  reported  by  Conceição  (2010), 
who studied E. coli strains associated with sepsis 
in  humans  and  detected  biofilm  production  in 
81.7% of the isolates.  
 
Previous  studies  conducted  by  Ito  et  al.  (2009) 
and  Ponnusamy  et  al.  (2012)  have  shown  an 
association  between  the  production  of  biofilm 
and  antimicrobial

Multi-resistance 
is 
disseminated  among  strains  of  E.  coli,  although 
the  vast  majority  of 
them  are  considered 
commensal.  Thus,  the  transmission  of  these 
micro-organisms  to  humans  poses  a  serious  risk 
to  public  health  as  well  as  to  other  animal 
species. Further studies are required to elucidate 
the  importance  of  each  phylogenetic  group  to 
pigs  and  to  prevent  the  propagation  of  multi-
resistant  E.  coli,  which  may  be  an  important 
pathogen for several species.
