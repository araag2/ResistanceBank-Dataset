ABSTRACT

Staphylococcus  aureus is  the  leading  pathogen  in-
volved  in bovine  mastitis,  but  knowledge about  anti-
microbial  resistance,  virulence  factors,  and  genotypes 
of  Staphylococcus  aureus  resulting  in  bovine  mastitis 
in Ningxia, China, is limited. Therefore, antimicrobial 
susceptibility, virulence gene, and randomly amplified 
polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analyses of Staph. aureus 
were carried out. A total of 327 milk samples from cows 
with  clinical  and  subclinical  mastitis  in  4  regions  of 
Ningxia were used for the isolation and identification 
of  pathogens  according  to  phenotypic  and  molecular 
characteristics. Antimicrobial susceptibility against 22 
antimicrobial agents was determined by disk diffusion. 
The presence of 8 virulence genes in Staph. aureus iso-
lates  was  tested  by  PCR.  Genotypes  of  isolates  were 
investigated  based  on  RAPD.  Results  showed  that 
35  isolates  obtained  from  mastitis  milk  samples  were 
identified as Staph. aureus. The isolates were resistant 
to sulfamethoxazole (100%), penicillin G (94.3%), am-
picillin  (94.3%),  erythromycin  (68.6%),  azithromycin 
(68.6%), clindamycin (25.7%), amoxicillin (11.4%), and 
tetracycline (5.7%). All of the isolates contained one or 
more virulence genes with average (standard deviation) 
of 6.6 ± 1.6. The most prevalent virulence genes were 
hlb (97.1%), followed by fnbpA, hla, coa (94.3% each), 
nuc  (85.7%),  fnbpB  (80%),  clfA  (77.1%),  and  tsst-1 
(40%). Nine different gene patterns were found and 3 
of them were the dominant gene combinations (77.1%). 
Staphylococcus  aureus  isolates  (n  =  35)  were  divided 
into  6  genotypes  by  RAPD  tying,  the  genotypes  III 
and VI were the most prevalent genotypes. There was

great variation in genotypes of Staph. aureus isolates, 
not  only  among  different  farms,  but  also  within  the 
same  herd  in  Ningxia  province.  The  study  showed  a 
high incidence of Staph. aureus with genomic variation 
of resistance genes, which is matter of great concern in 
public and animal health in Ningxia province of China.

INTRODUCTION

 

Bovine mastitis is a major disease affecting the dairy 
industry  worldwide  with  huge economic loss  and  de-
creased animal health (Ahmady and Kazemi, 2013; Deb 
et  al.,  2013;  Gomes  and  Henriques,  2016).  Although 
mastitis is often caused by a wide variety of pathogens, 
such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, mycoplasma, and oth-
ers,  Staphylococcus  aureus  is  still  described  as  one  of 
the  most  frequently isolated  etiological  agents  associ-
ated with bovine intramammary infections (Momtaz et 
al., 2010; Lundberg et al., 2016). Antimicrobial therapy 
is an important tool in mastitis control programs, but 
Staphylococcus aureus responds poorly to therapy with 
antimicrobial agents (Saei, 2012; Deb et al., 2013; Xu et 
al., 2015; Gomes and Henriques, 2016). Antimicrobial 
resistance  of  the  Staph.  aureus  has  been  surveilled  in 
many countries and many studies have displayed differ-
ent results (El Behiry et al., 2012; Saei, 2012; Jagielski 
et  al.,  2014;  da  Costa  Krewer  et  al.,  2015;  Wang  et 
al.,  2015).  A  large  number  of  virulence  factors  have 
been  found  in  Staph.  aureus  originating  from  bovine 
mastitis, including clumping factor (clfA), fibronectin 
binding  proteins  (fnbpA  and  fnbpB),  hemolysins  (hla 
and  hlb),  thermonuclease  (nuc),  coagulase  (coa),  and 
toxic-shock syndrome toxin-1 (tsst-1), which help bac-
teria  to  survive  and  multiply  in  the  mammary  gland

(Xu et al., 2015; Kot et al., 2016). In recent decades, 
many molecular methods, such as random amplification 
of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis (Chiang et al., 
2014), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (Middleton et al., 
2002; Fijałkowski et al., 2014), multilocus sequence typ-
ing (Bardiau et al., 2013), RFLP (Puacz et al., 2015), 
multilocus  variable  number  tandem  repeat  analysis 
(SenGupta  et  al.,  2014),  spa  typing,  and  coagulase 
gene typing, have been widely used in epidemiological 
investigations of Staph. aureus mastitis in dairy cattle 
(Zadoks et al., 2011). With the merits of being rapid, 
able to discriminate, and easy to execute and interpret, 
RAPD analysis, a PCR-based DNA fingerprint method, 
has been used successfully to detect polymorphisms in 
strains of Staphylococcus species (Reinoso et al., 2004; 
Bardiau et al., 2013; Chiang et al., 2014).

It  has  been  well  documented  that  Staph.  aureus 
mastitis is an important cause of economic loss to the 
dairy industry (Middleton and Fox, 2002; Gomes and 
Henriques, 2016), but there is a paucity of information 
about  antimicrobial  resistance,  virulence  factors,  and 
genotype  profiles  of  Staph.  aureus  isolates  in  Ningxia 
province  of  China;  therefore,  the  aim  of  the  present 
study was to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility 
and virulence genes, and to perform the RAPD analysis 
of Staph. aureus isolates.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Isolation and Identification of Pathogens

Isolation  and  identification  of  pathogens  were  per-
formed  as  previously  described  (Bautista-Trujillo  et 
al., 2013; Khichar et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015). A 
total of 327 milk samples were collected from the cows 
with  clinical  mastitis  (n  =  92)  and  subclinical  mas-
titis  (n  =  235),  which  originated  from  10  herds  in  4 
geographic  regions  of  the  Ningxia  province  of  China 
(namely,  Yinchuan,  Wuzhong,  Shizuishan,  and  Zhon-
gwei). The samples were first streaked onto the sheep 
blood agar and incubated at 37°C for 48 h. The cultures 
were identified by morphological characteristics (color-
ing,  size,  hemolysis),  Gram  staining,  and  biochemical 
tests  (production  of  coagulase,  catalase,  and  DNase; 
fermentation of glucose, maltose, mannitol; and hydro-
lysis of esculin). All presumptive Staph. aureus isolates 
were further confirmed by molecular identification. The 
PCR of 16S rRNA gene of Staph. aureus was carried out 
as described previously (Lange et al., 2015). A pair of 
primers was designed (primer-1, 5(cid:99)-TTTTATGGAGA-
GTTTGATCCTGGC-3(cid:99); primer-2, 5(cid:99)-AGAAAGGAG-
GTGATCCAGCCG-3(cid:99)). The PCR program contained 
initial  denaturation  at  94°C  for  3  min;  30  cycles  of 
denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 63°C for 30 

s, and primer extension at 72°C for 1 min; and a final 
extension  step  at  72°C  for  5  min.  The  Staph.  aureus 
ATCC 25923 strain was used as the control strain.

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests

The  antimicrobial  susceptibility  test  of  the  isolates 
was  determined  by  disk  diffusion  method  according 
to the guideline of the Clinical Laboratory Standards 
Institute (CLSI, 2013; Wang et al., 2015). A total of 22 
antimicrobial agents were used to evaluate the antimi-
crobial resistance of the isolates, which included peni-
cillin G (10 IU/disk), ampicillin (10 μg/disk), amoxicil-
lin  (10  μg/disk),  cephalothin  (30  μg/disk),  cefradine 
(30 μg/disk), erythromycin (15 μg/disk), azithromycin 
(15  μg/disk),  oxacillin  (1  μg/disk),  cefoxitin  (30  μg/
disk),  streptomycin  (30  μg/disk),  gentamicin  (10  μg/
disk), kanamycin (30 μg/disk), amikacin (30 μg/disk), 
neomycin (30 μg/disk), clindamycin (2 μg/disk), doxy-
cycline  (30  μg/disk),  chloramphenicol  (30  μg/disk), 
sulfamethoxazole  (30  μg/disk),  ofloxacin  (5  μg/disk), 
norfloxacin (10 μg/disk), ciprofloxacin (5 μg/disk), and 
tetracycline (30 μg/disk). Results were recorded as sen-
sitive,  intermediate,  and  resistant.  The  Staph.  aureus 
ATCC 29213 strain was used as a control.

Detection of Virulence Genes

Staphylococcus aureus isolates (n = 35) were detected 
by PCR for the presence of virulence genes (Momtaz 
et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2015; Kot et al., 2016). The 
target genes, primer sequences, and target fragment of 
PCR products are given in Table 1. The PCR reactions 
were performed in a final volume of 25 μL of reaction 
mixture consisted of 50 ng of genomic DNA, 20 pmol of 
each primer, and 12.5 μL of 2× Taq PCR MasterMix 
(Tiangen  Biotech,  China:  0.1  U  of  Taq  polymerase/
μL, 0.5 mM dNTP each, 20 mM Tris-HCl/pH 8.3, 100 
mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2). The cycling conditions were 
the following: an initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min; 
30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 
specific temperature for 30 s, and primer extension at 
72°C for 1 min; and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min.

RAPD Typing of Isolates

The RAPD typing of Staph. aureus isolates was con-
ducted as described previously (Morandi et al., 2009; 
Gutiérrez et al., 2011) and all of 35 isolates were sub-
jected to RAPD analysis. For RAPD tying, the specific 
primer  (5(cid:99)-GTGGATGCGA-3(cid:99))  was  used.  The  PCR 
program included an initial denaturation step at 94°C 
for 4 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C 
for 30 s, annealing at 37°C for 45 s and primer exten-

for 8 min. The Staph. aureus ATCC 29213 strain was 
used as control.

Statistical Analysis

Data  were  expressed  as  absolute  numbers  and  per-
centages.  In  case  of  virulent  gene  patterns  in  Staph. 
aureus  isolates,  the  prevalence  of  virulent  genes  was 
given in mean ± standard deviation. Computation was 
performed using the SPSS (19.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, 
IL) statistical software package.

RESULTS

Isolation and Identification of Bovine  
Mastitis Pathogens

The pathogenic bacteria (68.8%) were isolated from 
225  samples  of  327  milk  samples  with  clinical  and 

subclinical mastitis in Ningxia province, in which the 
same type of bacterium (85.3%) was found in 192 milk 
samples and different species of bacteria (14.7%) exist-
ed in 33 milk samples. A total of 258 isolates from milk 
samples were obtained and identified by morphological 
and  biochemical  methods,  and  were  classified  into  9 
species  of  bacteria.  Coagulase-negative  staphylococci 
(28.3%) was the most prevalent pathogen isolated from 
bovine  mastitis  milks  in  Ningxia  province  of  China, 
followed by Streptococcus dysgalactiae (15.5%), Staph. 
aureus (13.6%), and Escherichia coli (10.5%; Table 2). 
In  the  present  study,  35  isolates  from  10  herds  in  4 
geographic  regions  were  initially  identified  as  Staph. 
aureus by morphological and biochemical methods. The 
percentages of the Staph. aureus in subclinical and clin-
ical mastitis samples were 13.7% (30/219) and 12.8% 
(5/39),  respectively  (Table  2).  The  identification  of 
isolates was confirmed by using the PCR of 16S rRNA 
gene of Staph. aureus. All Staph. aureus strains (n = 
35)  produced  a  species-specific  amplicon  of  1,551  bp

(Figure 1a and b), in which 5 isolates were from clinical 
mastitis cases, and the other 30 isolates originated from 
subclinical mastitis cases.

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test

The  antimicrobial  susceptibility  test  demonstrated 
that Staph. aureus isolates from bovine mastitis cases 
in  Ningxia  province  had  a  variable  degree  of  resis-
tance  to  the  antimicrobials  by  antimicrobial  suscep-
tibility  tests  (Table  3).  They  were  resistant  to  sulfa-
methoxazole  (100%),  penicillin  G  (94.3%),  ampicillin 
(94.3%), erythromycin (68.6%), azithromycin (68.6%), 
clindamycin (25.7%), amoxicillin (11.4%), and tetracy-
cline  (5.7%),  respectively.  However,  all  of  them  were 
susceptible  to  oxacillin  (100%),  cephalothin  (100%), 

cefoxitin (100%), cefradine (100%), gentamicin (100%), 
kanamycin (100%), amikacin (100%), neomycin (100%), 
doxycycline (100%), chloramphenicol (100%), ofloxacin 
(100%), norfloxacin (100%), ciprofloxacin (100%), and 
streptomycin (94.3%), respectively.

Detection of Virulence Genes

Eight virulence genes in Staph. aureus isolates were 
found  by  PCR  in  the  present  study,  the  results  indi-
cated  that  the  most  prevalent  virulence  gene  was  hlb 
(97.1%), followed by fnbpA, hla, and coa (94.3% each), 
nuc  (85.7%),  fnbpB  (80%),  clfA  (77.1%),  and  tsst-1 
(40%), respectively (Table 4). Nine different gene pat-
terns were found in the Staph. aureus isolates and 3 of 
them were the dominant gene combinations, account-

All of the Staph. aureus isolates from bovine mastitis 
contained one or more virulence genes, and the average

that  Staph.  aureus  isolates  had  substantial  genotype 
variation,  not  only  among  different  farms,  but  also 
within the same herd in Ningxia province (Table 7).

RAPD Typing of Isolates

The  RAPD  typing  of  Staph.  aureus  isolates  stated 
clearly that the 35 Staph. aureus isolates from several 
regions produced distinctive amplicon patterns in the 
150-  to  1,800-bp  range  (Figure  2a  and  b).  InfoQuest 
FP software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) was 
used to do cluster analysis of the isolates, and the ge-
netic relationship cluster map was established (Figure 
3).  The  Staph.  aureus  isolates  were  clustered  into  6 
genotypes (I to VI) according to their similarity, (Table 
6), 2 of which consisted of 71.4% isolates (25/35), and 
were prevalent in isolated Staph. aureus. Genotypes III 
and VI were prevalent and observed in all 4 geographic 
regions studied in Ningxia (Table 6). The results showed

DISCUSSION

Staphylococcus aureus is one of the leading pathogens 
causing  intramammary  infections  in  dairy  cows,  and 
inducing  clinical  and  subclinical  mastitis  (Middleton 
and Fox, 2002; Wang et al., 2009). In previous reports, 
Staph.  aureus  was  initially  identified  on  the  basis  of 
phenotypic characteristics including morphological fea-
tures  (coloring,  size,  hemolysis),  Gram  staining,  and 
biochemical  tests  (production  of  coagulase,  catalase, 
and  DNase;  fermentation  of  glucose,  maltose,  manni-
tol; and hydrolysis of esculin) (Bautista-Trujillo et al., 
2013; Khichar et al., 2014). Recently identification of 
isolates used to be confirmed by molecular techniques, 
such as the PCR of 16S rRNA gene of Staph. aureus

(Lange et al., 2015; Rajic-Savic et al., 2015). In the cur-
rent study, 35 isolates from 327 mastitis milk samples 
from 10 dairy farms in Ningxia province of China were 
identified  as  Staph.  aureus  according  to  phenotypic 
characteristics and molecular method.

Because  of  the  poor  treatment  effect  of  antibiotics 
on  infections  with  Staph.  aureus,  it  is  extremely  im-
portant  to  determine  the  antibiotic  sensitivity  of  the 
Staph. aureus isolates from bovine mastitis, which can 
be helpful in choosing the most suitable drug for the 
treatment of the disease. By recognizing the resistance 
mechanisms, effective measures to control the disease 
can  be  established  (Saei,  2012;  da  Costa  Krewer  et 
al.,  2015).  In  this  study,  the  results  of  antimicrobial 
resistance  tests  indicated  that  Staph.  aureus  isolates 
from  cows  displayed  differences  in  the  antimicrobial 

susceptibility  patterns.  The  isolates  were  resistant  to 
sulfamethoxazole,  penicillin  G,  ampicillin,  erythromy-
cin,  and  azithromycin.  Similar  findings  were  reported 
by El Behiry et al. (2012) and Jagielski et al. (2014). It 
is strongly recommend that penicillin  and  ampicillin, 
along with other β-lactam antibiotics, due to 94% drug 
resistance, should not be used in the treatment of IMI 
with Staph. aureus in dairy cows in Ningxia province 
of China.

Previous  reports  indicated  that  a  large  number  of 
virulence factors have been found in Staph. aureus orig-
inating from bovine mastitis cases, including adhesins, 
hemolysins, thermonuclease, and coagulase (Momtaz et 
al., 2010; Xu et al., 2015; Kot et al., 2016). In the present 
study, we observed that most of the Staph. aureus iso-
lates harbored the clfA, fnbpA, fnbpB, hla, hlb, nuc, and

coa genes (77.1 to 97.1%). The ability of Staph. aureus 
to  adhere  to  extracellular  matrix  proteins  is  essential 
for the colonization and establishment of infections and 
Staph. aureus possesses various adhesion genes, such as 
clfA, fnbpA, and fnbB (Ote et al., 2011; Pereyra et al., 
2016). In the current study, clfA (77.1%), fnbpA (94.3%), 
and fnbpB (80%) were detected in Staph. aureus strains 
isolated  from  bovine  mastitis  cases.  Staphylococcal 
hemolysins were identified as important virulence fac-
tors that contributed to bacterial invasion and escape 
from the host immune response (Berube and Bubeck, 
2013; Salgado-Pabón et al., 2014; Pereyra et al., 2016). 
In  this  study,  94.3%  of  the  total  strains  had  the  hla 
gene and 97.1% of the total strains had the hlb gene, 
in  agreement  with  previous  reports  (Xu  et  al.,  2015; 
Pereyra  et  al.,  2016).  Staphylococcus  aureus produced 
an extracellular thermostable nuclease, encoded by the 
nuc gene,  whose  activity  has  been  used  for  the  rapid 
and direct detection of Staph. aureus (Sahebnasagh et 
al., 2014; Sudhaharan et al., 2015). The results of this 
study showed that 85.7% of the Staph. aureus isolates 
contained the nuc gene, which was consistent with oth-
er studies (Kalorey et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2015). The 
coagulase gene was one of the most important virulence 
genes  of  Staph.  aureus  isolates  and  the  expression  of 
this  gene  was  thought  to  resist  phagocytosis,  making 
the bacteria more virulent (Khoshkharam-Roodmajani 
et al., 2014; Peetermans et al., 2015). The findings of 
this  study  indicated  that  94.3%  of  the  Staph.  aureus 
isolates  harbored  the  coa  gene,  which  was  similar  to 
other studies (Khoshkharam-Roodmajani et al., 2014; 
Moghassem et al., 2015). Toxic shock syndrome toxin 
1 (tsst-1), a superantigen secreted by Staph. aureus in 
susceptible hosts, was responsible for toxic shock syn-
drome in humans (Kulhankova et al., 2014; Udo et al., 
2016; Zarei Koosha et al., 2016). Currently, we found 
that 40% of Staph. aureus isolates had the tsst-1 gene, 
which  was  in  agreement  with  previous  human  stud-
ies  (Udo  et  al.,  2016).  However,  in  a  large  European 

studies (Cosandey et al., 2016) involving 10 countries 
and  using  456  Staph.  aureus  isolates,  59  strains  were 
positive  for  the  tsst-1  gene  (12.9%).  The  prevalence 
of tsst-1 gene of Staph. aureus isolates was highest in 
Switzerland (27.9%), whereas in the other countries it 
varied between 0 and 16.7%.

In  the  present  study,  the  35  Staph.  aureus  isolates 
from 4 geographic regions in Ningxia province of China 
were grouped into 6 genotypes; 2 particular subtypes 
(genotype  III  and  genotype  VI)  were  associated  with 
high within-herd prevalence of IMI, which was in ac-
cordance with current knowledge (Bardiau et al., 2013). 
The analysis confirmed that IMI-associated Staph. au-
reus strains are clonal as reported in previous studies 
(Kock  et  al.,  2013;  Vandendriessche  et  al.,  2014).  In 
Morandi et al. (2009) and Costa et al. (2012), genetic 
heterogeneity was found among multiple isolates from 
dairy herds, indicating that the Staph. aureus popula-
tion in a single herd can be multiclonal. Furthermore, 
the genetic diversity of Staph. aureus originating from 
dairy cows can be relatively lower than that in human 
beings  (Reinoso  et  al.,  2004).  Rabello  et  al.  (2007) 
characterized the strains of Staph. aureus and investi-
gated that strain heterogeneity within herds and strain 
homogeneity between herds in different countries. The 
findings of our experiment proved that the genotype of 
Staph. aureus in milks has distinctive diversity in the 
Staph. aureus population studied and the existence of 
predominant clones account for most infections within 
and among herds in Ningxia province.

CONCLUSIONS

A  total  of  35  isolates  obtained  from  mastitis  milk 
samples in Ningxia province of China were identified as 
Staph.  aureus  according  to  phenotypic  characteristics 
and molecular method. The pathogens displayed differ-
ences  in  antimicrobial  resistance.  The  most  prevalent 
virulence  genes  were  hlb  (97.1%),  followed  by  fnbpA,

hla, and coa (94.3% each), nuc (85.7%), fnbpB (80%), 
clfA (77.1%), and tsst-1 (40%), respectively. Nine dif-
ferent gene patterns were found, and 3 of them had the 
dominant gene combinations (77.1%). All of the Staph. 
aureus  isolates  from  bovine  clinical  and  subclinical 
mastitis contained one or more virulence genes, and the 
average (SD) was 6.6 ± 1.6. The Staph. aureus isolates 
were  divided  into  6  genotypes  by  RAPD  tying,  and 
genotypes  III  and  VI  were  the  most  prevalent  geno-
types. There was great variation in genotypes in Staph. 
aureus isolates not only among different farms, but also 
within the same herd in Ningxia province.
