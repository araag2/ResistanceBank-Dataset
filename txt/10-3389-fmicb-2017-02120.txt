infections are a growing public health concern.
Multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli
This study analyzed the possibility of contamination of commercial poultry meat
(broiler and free-range) with pathogenic and or multi-resistant E. coli
in retail chain
poultry meat markets in India. We analyzed 168 E. coli
isolates from broiler and
free-range retail poultry (meat/ceca) sampled over a wide geographical area, for their
antimicrobial sensitivity, phylogenetic groupings, virulence determinants, extended-
spectrum-β-lactamase (ESBL) genotypes, ﬁngerprinting by Enterobacterial Repetitive
Intergenic Consensus (ERIC) PCR and genetic relatedness to human pathogenic E. coli
using whole genome sequencing (WGS). The prevalence rates of ESBL producing
E. coli among broiler chicken were: meat 46%; ceca 40%. Whereas, those for free
range chicken were: meat 15%; ceca 30%. E. coli from broiler and free-range chicken
exhibited varied prevalence rates for multi-drug resistance (meat 68%; ceca 64%
and meat 8%; ceca 26%, respectively) and extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC)
contamination (5 and 0%, respectively). WGS analysis conﬁrmed two globally emergent
human pathogenic lineages of E. coli, namely the ST131 (H30-Rx subclone) and ST117
among our poultry E. coli isolates. These results suggest that commercial poultry meat
is not only an indirect public health risk by being a possible carrier of non-pathogenic
multi-drug resistant (MDR)-E. coli, but could as well be the carrier of human E. coli
pathotypes. Further, the free-range chicken appears to carry low risk of contamination
with antimicrobial resistant and extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC). Overall, these
observations reinforce the understanding that poultry meat in the retail chain could
possibly be contaminated by MDR and/or pathogenic E. coli.

INTRODUCTION

The rapid global rise of Escherichia coli infections that are resistant to therapeutically important
antimicrobials, including ﬁrst-line drugs such as cephalosporins and ﬂuoroquinolones, is of serious
concern, as it hampers treatment of infections leading to signiﬁcant morbidity, mortality, medical
costs as well as production losses in livestock (de Been et al., 2014). E. coli is responsible for

infections in humans and animals; these could be nosocomial
and/or community-acquired (Jadhav et al., 2011). Being part of
the endogenous microbiota, E. coli can easily acquire resistance
against antimicrobials consumed by humans and animals (van
den Bogaard et al., 2001).

Poultry are recognized as important source for dissemination
of antimicrobial resistant E. coli
in the community and
environment (van den Bogaard et al., 2001). Pathogenic E. coli
in poultry are a direct threat to both poultry industry and human
health as they may result in hard-to-treat infections (Kaper et al.,
2004). Extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), the causative
agent of colibacillosis in chickens inﬂict severe losses due to
morbidity and condemnations (Kaper et al., 2004). ExPEC can
also cause several extraintestinal diseases in humans, including
urinary tract infections, neonatal meningitis, and sepsis (Avasthi
et al., 2011; Hussain et al., 2012; Nandanwar et al., 2016; Ranjan
et al., 2017). Apart from ExPEC, the poultry gut could also
harbor other variants of intestinal pathogenic E. coli (Lutful
Kabir, 2010). Recent studies in diﬀerent parts of India have
reported antimicrobial residues in food animal products such
as milk and chicken meat, indicating that antimicrobial usage
is widespread in food animal production (Laxminarayan and
Chaudhury, 2016). Such practices lead to high proportion of
antibiotic resistant bacteria in their fecal microbiota (Chen and
Jiang, 2014). Consequently, meat at slaughtering operations can
be extensively contaminated with fecal E. coli of poultry origin
(Lutful Kabir, 2010).

The ExPEC pathotype that is isolated from poultry with
clinical signs of extraintestinal infections is known as avian
pathogenic E. coli (APEC) (Kaper et al., 2004). Although
research has been mainly focused on infections caused by
APEC pathotype, little is known about the reservoirs of these
bacteria (Bélanger et al., 2011). Also, many human and animal
ExPEC isolates share virulence genes and clonal backgrounds
and the human health risk posed by such bacteria from poultry
is still
largely undeﬁned (Dziva et al., 2013). Moreover, the
pathotype APEC itself is ill-deﬁned (Collingwood et al., 2014).
One study even suggested that an APEC strain showed high
genome similarity to human enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC)
(Dziva et al., 2013). Therefore, the question of whether fecal
isolates of poultry serve as a source of infection for extraintestinal
and intestinal infections in humans remains unanswered. Recent
investigations compared E. coli from symptomatic poultry and
human ExPEC by virulence genotyping, serotyping and in vitro
assays (Nandanwar et al., 2014; Mitchell et al., 2015). However,
the application of high-resolution, whole genome sequencing
methods appears to be superior and is likely to provide accurate
insights into the phylogenetic backgrounds of poultry E. coli and
would likely highlight the similarities between isolates of diﬀerent
human pathotypes (de Been et al., 2014).

The presence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria in food has
been attributed to the widespread use of antimicrobials in
farming practices (Landers et al., 2012; Qumar et al., 2017).
Currently, few data are available regarding the contamination of
retail foods with E. coli, especially those that are multi-resistant
and pathogenic (Zhang et al., 2011). Also, little is known about
the frequency of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms in poultry

that were raised by free-range farming as methods of livestock
production diﬀer in antibiotic usage practices (Brower et al.,
2017). Therefore, the main aim of this study was to estimate
the frequencies of contamination with pathogenic and/or multi
resistant E. coli among broiler and free-range chicken specimens
(ceca and meat) and to characterize the E. coli isolates recovered
from them in relation to the human E. coli pathotypes. Results of
this study reinforces the importance of One Health approach in
addressing the spread of antimicrobial resistance and emerging
infections.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Specimen Collection
Between February, 2015 to September, 2015, 22 poultry retail
outlets were sampled from four cities representatives of four
diﬀerent states of India: Karnataka (n = 35), Telangana (n = 59),
Andhra Pradesh (n = 15) and Maharashtra (n = 11); this
resulted in a total of 120 samples. A total of 75 poultry ceca,
entailing broiler and free-range chicken (39 and 36, respectively)
together with 45 raw meat samples, representing broiler and
free-range chicken (32 and 13, respectively) were obtained from
retail poultry outlets. From each shop, multiple samples (diﬀerent
birds) were procured. Samples were transported to laboratory in
cooled boxes (4–8◦C) and upon arrival were stored at 4◦C and
processed within 24 h.

Broiler represented commercial broiler chickens that were
conventionally raised in farms and fed with commercial feeds;
free-range poultry birds were country (native) chickens that were
raised in households and small backyard farms that grew by
free-ranging.

Culture Methods
All cecal samples were surface sterilized with 70% ethanol and
a portion (∼25 g) was incised and placed in a 1.5 ml micro-
centrifuge tube containing Luria Bartani (LB) broth. Similarly,
around 25 g of raw meat was excised from each sample and
rinsed with 1X PBS and the sample was placed in a Petri dish
containing 1 ml LB broth and minced into small pieces. Each
cecum and chicken sample was taken out of the LB broth and
swabbed on the edge of the plate and then spread with a loop, this
was done on two separate agar plates; one on unsupplemented
Eosin Methylene Blue (EMB) agar plate, and another on EMB
agar supplemented with 10 µg/ml ciproﬂoxacin together with
4 µg/ml cefotaxime (this was used to increase the chance of
ST131 E. coli isolation). All plates were incubated at 37◦C for
12 h. One putative E. coli was selected from each culture plate,
which was then conﬁrmed by standard biochemical methods.
All E. coli isolates were preserved in 20% glycerol-supplemented
Luria-Bertani broth at −80◦C.

belonging to six diﬀerent antibiotic classes was assessed
by standard disk diﬀusion method as per CLSI guidelines
(Schissler et al., 2009; Hussain et al., 2014). ESBL production
was determined using double-disk synergy test
following
CLSI guidelines (CLSI, 2013). Phenotypically conﬁrmed ESBL-
producers were analyzed for the presence of genes encoding
CTX-M-15 and that of blaSHV, and blaTEM genes by three gene
speciﬁc PCRs (Ranjan et al., 2015).

As the EMB agar plates (i.e., with or without antibiotic
supplement) were streaked using an identical inoculum, the
percentage of resistance/susceptibility to diﬀerent antibiotics was
determined in relation to the total E. coli population.

Phylogenetic Groups, Virulence
Genotyping, ST131 Detection, and
Enterobacterial Intergenic Repetitive
Element Sequences (ERIC)-PCR
Phylogenetic groups of E. coli
isolates were determined by
quadruplex PCR and by employing the criteria as described
by Clermont et al. (2013). All isolates were screened for the
presence of the following ﬁve ExPEC genes (Hussain et al.,
2014); papC (P ﬁmbriae), sfa (s ﬁmbriae), afa (aﬁmbrial adhesin),
aer (siderophore related protein), and cvaC (protectin). The
criteria elaborated by Johnson et al. (2003) were used to classify
E. coli isolates as ExPEC with some modiﬁcations. All E. coli
isolates were screened for ST131 gene speciﬁc PCR as described
elsewhere (Hussain et al., 2014). ERIC-PCR based ﬁngerprint
analysis was performed as described in our earlier study (Hussain
et al., 2014). The ERIC-PCR bands obtained were analyzed using
BioNumerics software (Applied Maths, Belgium) (Hussain et al.,
2014).

Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and
Comparison with Human E. coli
Pathotypes
Paired end sequencing of the 10 genetically distinct (based on
ERIC bands), and randomly selected MDR-ESBL producing
poultry E. coli (seven cecum and three meat) isolates was carried
out using Illumina MiSeq. The accession numbers of 10 poultry
E. coli genomes including their genomic features are represented
in Supplementary Tables S1 and S4. Paired end read data were
ﬁltered for high quality reads followed by de novo assembly using
NGS QC Toolkit (v2.3.3) (Patel and Jain, 2012) and SPAdes
Genome Assembler (v3.6.1) (Bankevich et al., 2012), respectively.
The de novo contigs thus generated were ordered and scaﬀolded
using Contig-Layout-Authenticator (Shaik et al., 2016). Final
draft genomes were obtained by merging the scaﬀolds using
a series of N’s and then submitted to the RAST (Overbeek
et al., 2014) server for annotation. The genome statistics were
gleaned using ARTEMIS (Rutherford et al., 2000). The sequence
type (ST) of each of these strains were determined by in silico
MLST as used/described elsewhere (Ranjan et al., 2015). Mobile
genetic elements as reported in the ExPEC strain EC958 (Totsika
et al., 2011) were used as reference to compare the 6 E. coli
genomes using BRIG (Alikhan et al., 2011). A core-genome-based
phylogenetic tree of 50 E. coli strains (10 in house poultry E.

coli genomes, 10 healthy broiler chicken E. coli genomes from
public sources, 10 APEC, 10 ExPEC and 10 enteric pathogens)
(Supplementary Tables S1 and S3) was constructed using Harvest
(Treangen et al., 2014) and the resulting tree was visualized using
iTol1. Virulence and Resistance proﬁles of these 50 strains were
generated and hierarchical clustering was performed using the
gplot package of R as described/used by us before (Ranjan et al.,
2016).

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis for prevalence of antimicrobial resistance,
phylogenetic groups, ESBL and virulence genes were carried
out using Fisher’s exact two-tailed test. Statistical analyses for
aggregate resistance and virulence scores were carried out using
the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U-test. Both the tests were
implemented in the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
(SPSS, version 10.0). P-values ≤ 0.05 were considered as
statistically signiﬁcant.

RESULTS

(ciproﬂoxacin-plus-cefotaxime)

Over Half of the Chicken Meat Samples
Were Contaminated with E. coli
A total of 168 E. coli
isolates were recovered from 120
poultry samples using both unsupplemented and antibiotic
supplemented
agar,
encompassing 105 and 63 isolates, respectively (Supplementary
Table S2). Out of the 32 and 13 raw meat samples from broiler and
free-range chicken, 29 (91%) and 11 (84%) were contaminated
with E. coli, respectively. Further, compared to broiler chicken
meat
free-range chicken meat demonstrated lower
contamination (15%) by E. coli when screened on dual
antibiotic supplemented plates (ciproﬂoxacin-plus-cefotaxime)
(Supplementary Table S2).

(78%),

Resistance to Empirically Used
Antibiotics Was Rampant in Poultry
E. coli
Across the entire dataset of poultry E. coli isolates, resistance to
tetracycline was most prevalent (84%) followed by ciproﬂoxacin
(70%), co-trimoxazole (45%), and gentamicin (32%) whereas
a small fraction of total E. coli were found to be resistant to
chloramphenicol (8%) and fosfomycin (4%) (Table 1). Within
each category of chicken samples (broiler and free-range), the
isolation sources (ceca and raw meat) did not vary with respect
to antimicrobial resistance proﬁles (P > 0.05 for all variables
between groups 1 and 3; and groups 2 and 4) (Table 1). However,
the two categories of chicken E. coli isolates exhibited signiﬁcant
diﬀerence in prevalence of resistance (MDR and aggregate
resistance scores). Strains of E. coli samples in the free-range
category tended to be resistant to fewer antimicrobial agents
(Table 1). Overall, the rates of ESBL producers in broiler and
free-range chicken were as follows: meat 46%; ceca 40% and meat

MDR and Pathogenic Poultry E. coli

15%; ceca 30%, respectively (Table 1). The prevalence of ESBL
genes diﬀered insigniﬁcantly among the four ESBL positive E. coli
groups (Table 1).

Broiler Chicken Was a Potential Source
of Pathogenic E. coli Variants Than the
Free-Range Chicken
The distribution of poultry E. coli isolates with respect to the
seven phylogenetic groups is shown in Table 2. Overall, the
majority of poultry E. coli isolates were aﬃliated to group A and
B1 (36% each), followed by group D (9%), C (8%), F (7%), E and
B2 (2%, each). The prevalence of virulence genes among broiler
and free-range chicken E. coli isolates was stratiﬁed, but the
signiﬁcant prevalence diﬀerence (P = 0.000) was only observed
between the ceca isolates of the above two categories (Table 2).
Overall, 5% (5/109) of broiler E. coli isolates were identiﬁed
to be extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) based on the
detection of three or more ExPEC virulence markers. However,
none of the free-range chicken E. coli isolates was suspected to
be belonging to ExPEC. Similarly, we found one putative ST131
E. coli in broiler category, which was later conﬁrmed by WGS
and in silico MLST, whereas none (0/59) of the free-range E. coli
isolates belonged to ST131 clone.

Multiple Chicken Samples from Same
Shops Harbored Identical E. coli Clones
We investigated the genetic relationships among the E. coli
isolates obtained from broiler and free-range chicken samples
(Figure 1). A total of 60 isolates that were multidrug resistant and
originating from diﬀerent geographical locations were analyzed
that represented 38 broiler (22 ceca and 16 raw meat) and 22
free-range chicken isolates (12 ceca and 10 raw meat). Out of
60 isolates, 52 distinct ERIC proﬁles were obtained. Overall,
the broiler and free-range chicken E. coli isolates demonstrated
promiscuous genetic ﬁngerprints as the two categories did
not form distinct clusters. A total of 39 out of 60 isolates
demonstrated a close genetic relatedness (similarity coeﬃcient
of ≤80%) which were represented in the form of several small
sub-clusters. Six out of eight identical clades corresponded
consistently with the geographic origin, isolation source and
ESBL status but not the sample origin; this possibly hints at cross
contamination during rearing, slaughtering and/or processing.

Poultry E. coli Isolates Shared
Remarkable Similarities with Human and
Avian E. coli Pathotypes
The general features of 10 in-house whole genome sequenced
poultry E. coli isolates were shown in Supplementary Tables S1
and S4. We generated a phylogenetic tree (Figure 2) of 10 in-
house isolates to study their relationship with 40 other publicly
available genomes comprising of 20 human disease-associated
E. coli (10 ExPEC and 10 enteric pathogens), 10 Avian pathogenic
E. coli (APEC) and 10 E. coli genomes from healthy broiler
chickens (Supplementary Table S3). Despite genetic diversity, the
phylogenetic tree was able to largely cluster isolates of diﬀerent
pathotypes. The clade 1 was dominated with avian strains and

clade 2 mainly comprised genomes of enteric strains together
with poultry E. coli. The clade 3 comprised strains from all ﬁve
pathotypes in which the in-house poultry E. coli was found to
be co-clustered with APEC, poultry and ExPEC strains but not
with enteric strains. Out of 10 poultry genomes analyzed, one was
represented in clade 1, four genomes in clade 2 and ﬁve genomes
in clade 3. Overall, we observed that the core genome content
of poultry E. coli genomes failed to demonstrate unambiguous
distinction with other human E. coli pathotypes.

Multiple genome comparison was carried out using BRIG tool
for one in-house poultry E. coli isolate (NAEC1 or NAPEC_15)
belonging to the ST131 lineage with ﬁve other ST131 E. coli
genomes to determine the status of 22 mobile genetic elements
as reported in EC958 (Figure 3). Out of six genomes, three
strains (JJ1886, NA114, and NA097) including the NAEC1 shared
signiﬁcant genetic similarities with respect to composition of
mobile genetic elements. However, the other avian genome
IHT25637 and the commensal ST131 genome SE15 contained
only few complete mobile elements. The presence of mobile
genomic islands in the poultry E. coli resembling to that of human
E. coli pathotypes reinforces the understanding that these isolates
could possibly cross infect humans and poultry.

In order to understand the genetic relationships of virulence
and resistance of poultry E. coli
in juxtaposition with the
genetic landscapes of diﬀerent human E. coli pathotypes, we
compared virulence and resistance proﬁles of 10 sequenced
poultry E. coli genotypes with 40 publicly E. coli genomes
(Supplementary Table S3). Hierarchical clustering of resistance
proﬁles (Figure 4B) demonstrated that the two sister clusters 1a
and 1b represented isolates from all pathotypes including the ﬁve
in-house poultry genomes. However, cluster 2 was clearly deﬁned
or dominated by poultry E. coli isolates that also contained the
remaining ﬁve in-house poultry genomes. The cluster obtained
by the virulence gene proﬁles (Figure 4A) grouped strains into
two categories; one composed of mixed pathotypes (sister clusters
1a and 1b) and the other cluster 2 was dominated with enteric
isolates (8/10 enteric genomes). The 10 in-house poultry E. coli
isolates were represented in the mixed clusters (1a and 1b)
indicating closer genetic identity with some pathotypes (ExPEC,
APEC and poultry E. coli), than with others (IPEC or enteric
pathotypes). Overall, these observations hint at the zoonotic
potential of poultry E. coli.

DISCUSSION

In this molecular-epidemiological study, we assessed E. coli
isolates obtained from retail poultry (meat/carcass) from a
wide geographical region extending across three south Indian
and one west-central Indian states (four states) by using
both conventional typing and WGS methods. Our ﬁndings
provide evidence that the raw retail poultry meat could indeed
be contaminated with antimicrobial-resistant and potentially
pathogenic E. coli. This is particularly alarming for countries such
as India given high disease burden, emergence of resistance traits,
and the conﬂuence of prevailing socio-economic, demographic
and environmental factors (Jadhav et al., 2011; Dikid et al., 2013).

clustering was performed by UPGMA algorithm based on Dice similarity coefﬁcients. The genotypic patterns generated by ERIC-PCR were analyzed at 80% cutoff.
Among the eight identical clades (C1 to C8), six clades corresponded consistently to geographic and isolation source.

Pathogenic E. coli

(ExPEC and diarrheagenic) are the
leading cause of
infections in both humans and poultry
(Ewers et al., 2007). Increased antimicrobial usage in the
poultry industry due to the growing demand might have
contributed signiﬁcantly to the emergence and dissemination of
multiresistant and pathogenic E. coli variants, which could be

a serious public health threat (Laxminarayan and Chaudhury,
2016). Hence, constant surveillance and knowledge of their
transmission and epidemiology with respect to their genetic
backgrounds, antimicrobial resistance patterns and speciﬁc
virulence attributes is pertinent (Mellata, 2013; Laxminarayan
and Chaudhury, 2016). Our ﬁndings therefore have potential

implications for public health policies entailing antibiotic usage
regulation.

Poultry industries use antibiotics both for

therapeutic
purposes and for growth promotion (Singer and Hofacre,
2006). Recent studies in diﬀerent parts of India have reported
antimicrobial residues in food animal products such as chicken

meat suggesting large-scale unregulated use of antibiotics by the
poultry industry (Laxminarayan and Chaudhury, 2016; Brower
et al., 2017). This is consistent with our observations as we
also found a marked predominance of antibiotic resistance
among E. coli
isolates obtained from conventionally raised
(broiler) chicken. In contrast, free-range chicken meat were

ExPEC, India), NA097; GCA_001029415.1 (Human ExPEC, India), SE15; GCA_000010485.1 (Human commensal, Japan), IHIT25637; GCA_001676995.1 (Avian

comparatively less contaminated with multidrug resistant E. coli;
this observation echoes previously reported studies (Koga
et al., 2015; Rugumisa et al., 2016). The above observation
complements the cross contamination hypothesis of poultry
carcasses with the host’s fecal ﬂora during slaughter and
processing also given that we found comparable antimicrobial
resistance prevalences in E. coli isolates entailing ceca and raw
meat samples of broiler chicken. Such observations were also
evidenced by others (Rasschaert et al., 2008; Firildak et al., 2015).
The reason for higher prevalence of antimicrobial resistance
in E. coli isolates of broiler chicken could be due to the high
antibiotic selection pressure.

to other

(Klimien˙e et al., 2017)
the
predominant ESBL genotype detected in chicken E.
coli
isolates was blaCTX−M−15 gene which is also the most frequently
reported genotype in human health care settings (Chen et al.,
2014). The pan-genome based resistance gene proﬁling revealed
that 50% of poultry E. coli shared resistance genes with human
E. coli pathotypes (Figure 4B). The formation of a separate
cluster of the remaining 50% of the poultry genomes indicates
diﬀerence in resistance determinants with that of human
E. coli resistomes which could be reﬂective of diﬀerences in
antimicrobial usage practices in human medicine and livestock
rearing.

Similar

studies

Although only a fraction of total poultry isolates did belong
to two well-established pathogenic phylogroups B2 and D (2%,
9%, respectively), a majority of them (36% each) belonged to
phylogroups A and B1 (Table 2), as also reported by others
(Jakobsen et al., 2010; Klimien˙e et al., 2017). Nonetheless, these
two phylogroups have also been previously described to harbor
isolates with a high pathogenic potential for birds and humans
(Rodriguez-Siek et al., 2005; Ewers et al., 2007; Kobayashi et al.,
2011). Virulence gene (Franz et al., 2015) screening demonstrated
that the broiler E. coli isolates diﬀered from free-range chicken
E. coli isolates by their higher prevalence of all the virulence
genes. Furthermore, ﬁve broiler E. coli isolates were identiﬁed to
be ExPEC with none from free-range chicken E. coli (Table 2).
The overall low prevalence of poultry E. coli isolates from ExPEC
category was expected because all samples were collected from
healthy birds. This corroborates also with the low prevalence of
phylogenetic group B2.

The phylogenetic tree, based on core genomes demonstrated
that, the poultry E. coli isolates are not a homogeneous group,
because some of the poultry E. coli isolates revealed similar
genetic backgrounds with human ExPEC and enteric isolates,
thus pointing to the role of chickens as reservoir of potentially
pathogenic E. coli. Only a few studies have investigated the
presence of E. coli ST131 in food animals; E. coli ST131 producing

MDR and Pathogenic Poultry E. coli

FIGURE 4 | Gene cluster results for 50 E. coli isolates: the presence (Black Square) and the absence (Gray Square) of virulence genes (A) and resistance genes (B)
are represented in the image. Gene names are listed on the left. E. coli pathotypes are listed below the image (APEC: avian pathogenic E. coli, ExPEC: extraintestinal
pathogenic E. coli, IPEC: intestinal pathogenic E. coli, PEC: healthy poultry E. coli, NA_PEC: in-house poultry E. coli). Results of resistance clustering indicated that
only 50% of our poultry E. coli shared resistance genes with other E. coli pathotypes (distributed in mixed clusters 1a and 1b) and the rest formed a separate group
(cluster 2, B). However, the virulence based cluster diagram showed that the in-house poultry (NAPEC) shared more virulence similarity with ExPEC and APEC
genomes compared to intestinal pathogenic E. coli (IPEC), as cluster 2 of (A) was dominated by enteric E. coli genomes without any poultry E. coli genome.

MDR and Pathogenic Poultry E. coli

CTX-M-15 also appears to be very rare in foodstuﬀs of animal
origin (Nicolas-Chanoine et al., 2014). This study conﬁrmed
the presence of
two globally emerging pathogenic lineages
of E. coli; ST131 (H30-Rx subclone) and ST117. The other
commonly identiﬁed sequence types among the 10 poultry E. coli
genomes were; ST115, ST155, and ST1640 which are reported
to be mostly associated with ESBL phenotypes (Borjesson et al.,
2013). Moreover, the identiﬁed ST131 E. coli contained more
pathogenicity islands than the other poultry genomes from
Europe and the commensal ST131 genome-SE15 (Figure 3).
The presence of such a strain in poultry meat belonging to
the epidemiologically successful clonal lineage ST131 (H30-Rx
subclone) warrants attention.

Corroborating with phylogeny results, virulence gene proﬁling
revealed that the poultry E. coli are not a homogenous group
and showed mixed clustering. However,
it provided better
resolution between ExPEC and enteric pathotypes (Figure 4A).
Nonetheless, a majority of poultry E. coli isolates and human
ExPEC were clustered together with respect to the virulence gene
content suggesting that they share remarkable similarities with
human ExPEC pathotypes (Figure 4A). The ERIC ﬁngerprinting
of broiler and free-range chicken E. coli isolates demonstrated
that the poultry E. coli are diverse. The identical clones that we
observed mostly corresponded to the geographic (abattoir) and
host (broiler and free-range) origins (Figure 1).

This geographically wide report on molecular and genomic
characterization of E. coli from broiler and free-range chickens is
the ﬁrst from India. Herein, we found that the raw retail poultry
meat was frequently contaminated with antimicrobial-resistant
E. coli and/or potentially pathogenic E. coli variants. However,
free-range chickens represented a low risk of contamination
with pathogenic and or resistant E. coli; this is particularly
important as India is an agricultural country with around 70%
of the population living in rural areas and many of the rural
households engage in backyard poultry raising (Singh, 2014). The
comparative genomic analysis suggests that the poultry E. coli
isolates share closer genetic identity to human E. coli as regards

to core genome phylogeny, antimicrobial genes and virulence
gene content and thus represent potential zoonotic risks. The
possibility that multi-drug resistant and /or pathogenic E. coli
could be potentially transmitted from food sources such as
chicken meat raises serious public health concerns regarding food
preparations where chicken meat may not be properly cooked or
could only be pickled raw.
