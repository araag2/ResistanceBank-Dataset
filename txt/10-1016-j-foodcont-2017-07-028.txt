This study investigated the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli using 

extended-spectrum b -lactamase (ESBL) and AmpC b -lactamase as exemplars of 

26 

27

29 

30 

multidrug-resistant phenotypes in poultry meat samples taken from open-air and 

31 

supermarkets in Phitsanulok province, Northern Thailand. Two hundred and fifty poultry 

32 

meat samples from open-air (n = 147) and supermarkets (n = 103) were analyzed. In total, 

33 

143 cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates comprising 78 isolates (53.1%) from open-air 

34 

markets and 65 isolates (63.1%) from supermarkets were obtained. No significant 

35 

difference could be observed in the prevalence of ESBL-positive E. coli between samples 

36 

taken from open-air (70.5%) and supermarkets (69.2%). ESBL genotypes comprised of 

37 

38 

39 

40 

blaCTX-M-group 1 (69%), blaCTX-M-group 9 (13%), blaTEM-116 (1%), blaSHV-2a (1%) and blaSHV-12 

(1%) were detected. 39.5% of the ESBL-negative E. coli possessed blaCMY-2. The blaCTX-M-

group 1, blaCTX-M-group 9 and blaCMY-2 were successfully transferred into E. coli by conjugation 

at high frequencies. Repetitive palindromic-PCR of some blaCTX-M and blaCMY-2-positive E. 

41 

coli isolates revealed identical DNA patterns suggesting clonal spread. Phylogenetic 

42 

grouping and MLST analysis revealed that 3 isolates were E. coli ST131. Of these, 2 

43 

44 

isolates were ESBL-negative and carried blaCMY-2. The other isolate was ESBL-positive 

and carried blaTEM-116. This is the first study to demonstrate ESBL and AmpC genotypes in 

45 

E. coli and the first discovery of human pathogen ST131 from Thai poultry meat. Our data 

46 

raises serious concerns for food safety and biosecurity in the Thai food industry.

1. Introduction  

3

52 

Resistance to broad spectrum b -lactams such as third-generation cephalosporins, 

53 

monobactam and carbapenems in Enterobacteriaceae, especially Escherichia coli, is 

54 

55 

rapidly increasing (Pitout, 2013). Reports on extended-spectrum b -lactamase (ESBL) 

and/or AmpC b -lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae from clinical and environmental 

56 

samples are continuously published from the majority of countries indicating a worldwide 

57 

dissemination. Several types of ESBLs have been reported such as SHV, TEM and CTX-

58 

M. CTX-M is the most prevalent ESBL while CMY-2 is frequently encountered AmpC in 

59 

human infections. ESBL- and AmpC-encoding genes are usually associated with mobile 

60 

genetic elements which strongly facilitate their spread within a bacterial population 

61 

(Jacoby 2009; Poirel, Bonnin, & Nordmann, 2012).  

62 

Contamination of meat with antibiotic-resistant bacteria has the potential to transfer 

63 

to humans and is a clear public health concern. Several studies have shown that meat, 

64 

especially poultry meat, is an important reservoir of antibiotic-resistant E. coli (Nguyen et 

65 

al., 2016; Schwaiger et al., 2012). The prevalence of ESBL- and AmpC-positive E. coli as 

66 

well as their respective resistant genes in different types of meat even in organic meat has 

67 

been reported from several countries (Cohen Stuart et al., 2012; Egea et al., 2012; 

68 

Ghodousi, Bonura, Di Noto, & Mammina, 2015; Kawamura, Goto, Nakane, & Arakawa, 

69 

2014). Furthermore, transmission of ESBL and AmpC-positive E. coli from meat to 

70 

human has been previously reported outside Thailand (Overdevest et al., 2011; Vincent et 

71 

al., 2010).  

72 

In Thailand, consumption of poultry meat is popular. Meat is often sold in open-air 

73 

markets, traditional Thai markets which are seen extensively throughout the country, and 

74 

western-style supermarkets which are becoming increasingly popular throughout Thailand.

75 

Previous studies in Thailand have revealed the presence of antibiotic-resistant 

76 

Enterobacteriaceae isolates in chicken meat and chicken rectal swab including those 

77 

producing ESBL (Boonyasiri et al., 2014; Chaisatit, Tribuddharat, Pulsrikarn, & 

78 

Dejsirilert, 2012; Trongjit, Angkittitrakul, & Chuanchuen, 2016). However, the prevalence 

79 

of ESBL- and/or AmpC-producing E. coli from meat samples in Thailand remains poorly 

80 

understood. This study investigated the prevalence of ESBL- and AmpC-encoding genes 

81 

from poultry meat samples obtained from both open-air and supermarkets as well as 

82 

determined E. coli pathogenicity groups.  

83 

  

84 

2. Materials and Methods  

85 

2.1 Samplings 

86 

Samplings of fresh poultry meat were performed in 29 open-air markets and 22 

87 

supermarkets in Phitsanulok province, Northern Thailand. A total of 250 poultry meat 

88 

samples (chicken = 218, duck = 14, bird = 18) from open-air markets (n = 147) and 

89 

supermarkets (n = 103) were sampled. Frozen poultry meat was excluded from the study. 

90 

All samples were originated from Thailand. Samples were maintained at 4 (cid:176) C and 

91 

processed immediately.  

92 

 

93 

2.2 Isolation and identification of third generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli  

94 

Twenty-five grams of each sample were homogenized with a Stomacher in 225 mL 

95 

buffered peptone water (Oxoid, Basingstroke, UK). Then, 10 mL of this homogenate were 

96 

enriched in 90 ml EE broth (Becton, Dickinson and Company, MD, USA) for 24 h at 37 

97 

(cid:176) C. The enrichment was plated onto EMB agar (Oxoid) supplemented with 2 µg/mL 

98 

cefotaxime (as an exemplar of broad-spectrum cephalosporins) (Sigma Aldrich, MO, 

99 

USA) and incubated under aerobic condition for 24 h at 37 (cid:176) C. Presumptive E. coli 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

5

100 

colonies isolated from each sample were subcultured on Tryptic Soy Agar and incubated 

101 

as described above for further characterizations. Species identification was performed by 

102 

using RapID™ ONE System (REMEL Inc., KS, USA) according to the manufacturers’ 

103 

instructions and confirmed by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene (Lane, 1991). 

104 

 

105 

2.3 Antimicrobial susceptibility and ESBL detection  

106 

All isolates were tested for susceptibility to 18 antimicrobial agents by disk 

107 

diffusion method according to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) protocols 

108 

and the results were evaluated according to CLSI criteria (CLSI, 2013). The antibiotics 

109 

tested were ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, cefpodoxime, cefepime, 

110 

aztreonam, imipenem, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin/sulbactam, amikacin, 

111 

gentamicin, doxycycline, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, chloramphenicol, and 

112 

trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Isolates showing intermediate results were considered as 

113 

resistant. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MICs) were determined by broth 

114 

microdilution method according to CLSI guidelines (CLSI, 2013). The MIC of each 

115 

antimicrobial agent was defined as the lowest concentration, which inhibited visible 

116 

growth of the organism.  

117 

Isolates were tested for ESBL production by combination disk method with 

118 

ceftazidime and cefotxime in the presence or absence of clavulanic acid, according to 

119 

CLSI guidelines (CLSI, 2013).  

120 

 

121 

2.4 Screening for ESBL- and AmpC-encoding genes by PCR and sequencing  

122 

 

All ESBL-producing isolates were investigated for the presence of ESBL-encoding 

123 

genes; blaTEM, blaSHV and blaCTX-M, by PCR as previously described (Dallenne, Da Costa, 

124 

Decré, Favier, & Arlet, 2010; Woodford, Fagan, & Ellington, 2006). Isolates showing 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

6

125 

resistance to cefoxitin were examined for the presence of AmpC-encoding genes by 

126 

multiplex PCR (Pérez-Pérez, & Hanson, 2002). PCR products were analyzed by agarose 

127 

gel electrophoresis. 

128 

Selected PCR products were analyzed by DNA sequencing. Amplicons were 

129 

purified using a DNA purification kit (RBC Bioscience, New Taipei City, Taiwan) and 

130 

sequenced by First BASE Laboratories (Selangor, Malaysia). The obtained sequences were 

131 

compared with those available in the GenBank database using the BLAST algorithm 

132 

available on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website 

133 

(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). 

134 

 

135 

2.5 Conjugation experiments  

136 

137 

138 

To investigate the transfer of antibiotic resistance, conjugation experiments were 

carried out by broth mating method using rifampin-resistant E. coli DH5a

 as the recipient. 

Cultures of donor and recipient cells were mixed and incubated overnight at 37 (cid:176) C without 

139 

shaking. Transconjugants were selected on Tryptic Soy Agar supplemented with rifampin 

140 

(16 µg/mL) and cefotaxime (1 µg/mL). Conjugation frequency was expressed as the 

141 

number of transconjugants divided by the number of recipient cells. Transferrable of 

142 

antibiotic-resistant gene was confirmed by PCR. MICs of transconjugants were determined 

143 

by broth microdilution method. 

144 

 

145 

2.6 Repetitive-palindromic polymerase chain reaction (Rep-PCR)  

146 

 

E. coli isolates carrying either ESBL- or AmpC genes were typed by rep-PCR as 

147 

described previously by Versalovic, Koeuth, and Lupski (1991).

150 

2.7 Phylogenetic grouping and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis 

151 

Phylogenetic group (A, B1, B2 and D) of ESBL- and pAmpC-producing E. coli 

152 

was performed by a multiplex PCR assay for chuA, yjaA and DNA fragment TspE4C2 as 

153 

previously described (Clermont, Bonacorsi, & Bingen, 2000). Isolate belonging to group 

154 

B2 was investigated for the presence of pabB gene by PCR (Clermont et al., 2009). MLST 

155 

was performed by amplification and sequencing of 7 housekeeping genes (adk, fumC, 

156 

gyrB, icd, mdh, purA and recA) according to the protocols from E. coli MLST website 

157 

(http://mlst.warwick.ac.uk/mlst/dbs/Ecoli). 

 

158 

 

159 

2.8 Statistical analysis 

160 

 

Fisher’s exact test was used to compare proportions using Minitab software version 

161 

15. The differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.  

162

3. Results   

164 

3.1 Isolation of cefotaxime-resistant (Ctx-R) E. coli from poultry meat samples and ESBL 

165 

production 

166 

In this study, 250 poultry meat samples from open-air markets and supermarkets in 

167 

Phitsanulok province, Northern Thailand were analyzed (Table 1). In total, 143 Ctx-R E. 

168 

coli isolates comprising 78 isolates (53.1%, 95% CI = 45.0–61.1%) from open-air markets 

169 

and 65 isolates (63.1%, 95% CI = 53.8–72.4%) from supermarkets were obtained. The 

170 

percentages of Ctx-R E. coli isolates were not statistically different between samples 

171 

obtained from open-air and supermarkets (p = 0.121). Of the 143 isolates, 70.5% (55/78, 

172 

95% CI = 60.4–80.6%) and 69.2% (45/65, 95% CI = 58.0–80.5%) from open-air and 

173 

supermarkets, respectively, were ESBL-positive.

175 

3.2 Antimicrobial susceptibility testing  

176 

177 

Antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli isolates recovered from poultry meat 

samples was determined (Table 2). b -Lactam susceptibility test revealed that all 143 E. 

178 

coli isolates were resistant to ampicillin, cefotaxime and cefpodoxime and >90% were 

179 

resistant to aztreonam and ceftazidime. Resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate and 

180 

ampicillin/sulbactam was 60.1% and 82.5%, respectively. A small number of isolates were 

181 

resistant to imipenem (16.1%). High resistant rates (>60%) were also observed for 

182 

cefepime, amikacin, doxycycline, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. Furthermore, we 

183 

observed that ESBL-positive isolates showed significantly higher resistant rates to 

184 

cefepime, gentamicin, doxycycline, tetracycline, levofloxacin and 

185 

trimethoprim/sulfamethoxaole (p < 0.05) than the ESBL-negative isolates (Table 2). In 

186 

contrast, ESBL-negative isolates showed significantly higher resistant rates to cefoxitin, 

187 

amoxicillin/clavulanate and ampicillin/sulbactam (p < 0.05).  

188 

 

189 

3.3 Detection of antibiotic-resistant genes  

190 

Of the 143 Ctx-R isolates, 100 were shown to be ESBL-positive (Table 2). 

191 

Detection of ESBL- and AmpC-encoding genes in Ctx-R E. coli isolates was performed 

192 

and results were shown in Table 3. Of the 100 ESBL-positive isolates, 82 were found to 

193 

carry genes encoding for blaCTX-M. blaCTX-M-group 1 was the most prevalent (n = 69, 69%), 

194 

followed by blaCTX-M-group 9 (n = 13, 13%). blaTEM and blaSHV-related ESBL-genes were 

195 

also found i.e. blaTEM-116 (n = 1, 1%), blaSHV-2a (n = 1, 1%) and blaSHV-12 (n = 1, 1%). 

196 

Additionally, from the 43 ESBL-negative isolates, 17 (39.5%) were shown to be blaCMY-2-

197 

positive.

3.4 Conjugation experiments 

201 

Conjugation experiments were performed with randomly selected E. coli 

202 

containing blaCTX-M-group 1 (7 isolates), blaCTX-M-group 9 (2 isolates) and blaCMY-2 (3 isolates) 

203 

as donors. The blaCTX-M-group 1, blaCTX-M-group 9 and blaCMY-2 genes from donor isolates could 

204 

be transferred to the recipient strain E. coli DH5a

 with conjugation frequencies of 10-5-10-

205 

2, 10-4 and 10-7-10-5, respectively (Table 4). The presence of blaCTX-M-group 1, blaCTX-M-group 9 

206 

and blaCMY-2 in transconjugants was confirmed by PCR. The cefotaxime MICs were 

207 

markedly increased in transconjugants carrying blaCTX-M (> 128 fold) and blaCMY-2 (> 16-

208 

32 fold) compared with the recipient strain E. coli DH5a

 (Table 4). 

209 

 

210 

3.5 Typing of ESBL- and AmpC-positive E. coli by rep-PCR 

211 

 

The DNA profiles of blaCTX-M and blaCMY-2-positive E. coli generated with rep-

212 

PCR primers showed diverse banding patterns. However, the identical rep-PCR profiles in 

213 

some E. coli isolates were detected. The representative rep-PCR patterns of the isolates 

214 

were shown in Fig. 1. Rep-PCR analysis differentiated 69 and 13 isolates of blaCTX-M group 

215 

1- and blaCTX-M group 9-positive E. coli into 34 and 9 distinct patterns, respectively. However, 

216 

the identical patterns among isolates carrying blaCTX-M group 1 (Fig. 1A, Lanes 1 & 5, 2 & 3 

217 

and 4 & 6) and blaCTX-M group 9 (Fig. 1B, Lanes 1 & 2 and 3 & 4) were found. In addition, a 

218 

total of 11 distinct DNA profiles were found among 17 blaCMY-2-positive E. coli and 

219 

identical DNA patterns were detected (Fig. 1C, Lanes 1-3). Importantly, blaCTX-M group 1-

220 

positive E. coli isolates recovered from different open-air and supermarkets shared the 

221 

same rep-PCR pattern (Fig. 1A). In addition, we found that 22 isolates carried an identical 

222 

rep-PCR type but different CTX-M genes i.e. blaCTX-M group 1 (n = 19) and blaCTX-M group 9 (n 

223 

= 3).

3.6 Phylogenetic grouping and analysis of sequence type (ST)  

226 

Phylogenetic grouping of 85 ESBL- and 17 AmpC-positive E. coli isolates were 

227 

determined. The results showed that 51% belonged to group A, 27.5% to group B1 and 

228 

17.6% to group D. Only 4 isolates (3.9%) belonged to group B2 (Table 5). The prevalence 

229 

of blaCTX-M was significantly higher in the commensal phylogroups A and B1 than 

230 

pathogenic groups B2 and D (p < 0.001). In contrast, the prevalence of blaCMY-2 was 

231 

significantly higher in the pathogenic phylogroups D and B2 than commensal groups A 

232 

and B1 (p = 0.002). Of the 4 isolates, belonging to group B2, 3 isolates contained the pabB 

233 

gene, which is specific for subgroup I/ O25b. These 3 isolates were identified as ST131, by 

234 

MLST analysis. One carried blaTEM-116 and 2 carried blaCMY-2. 

235 

 

236 

4. Discussion   

237 

In this study, poultry meat samples from open-air and supermarkets in Phitsanulok 

238 

province, Northern Thailand were analyzed and a total of 143 Ctx-R E. coli isolates were 

239 

recovered from all types of poultry meat (chicken, duck and bird, Table 1). 

240 

A previous study in Thailand revealed the presence of ESBL-positive E. coli from chicken 

241 

meat however a limited number of meat samples were investigated (Boonyasiri et al., 

242 

2014). In contrast, we found a comparatively high prevalence of ESBL-positive E. coli 

243 

isolates from open-air (70.5%) and supermarkets (69.2%).  

244 

Antimicrobial susceptibility test of 143 Ctx-R E. coli isolates revealed the high 

245 

resistant rates for broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam and ciprofloxacin (Table 2). 

246 

These results were different from those reported previously from Thailand where E. coli 

247 

obtained from chicken meat was mainly susceptible to third generation cephalosporins and 

248 

ciprofloxacin (Chaisatit, Tribuddharat, Pulsrikarn, & Dejsirilert, 2012). Interestingly, 

249 

ESBL-positive E. coli isolates showed significantly higher resistance rates to many 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

11

250 

antibiotics than ESBL-negative isolates, consistent with the common feature of ESBL- 

251 

positive bacteria (Woerther, Burdet, Chachaty, & Andremont, 2013). In addition, we found 

252 

that all E. coli isolates, regardless of the ESBL production, exhibited multidrug-resistant 

253 

(MDR) phenotype as defined by Magiorakos et al. (2012).  

254 

blaCTX-M was commonly found among ESBL-positive isolates, although genes 

255 

encoding for TEM-, and SHV-type ESBLs such as blaTEM-116, blaSHV-2a and blaSHV-12 were 

256 

also detected (Table 3). Similar results were found in other studies which reported the 

257 

predominance of blaCTX-M in poultry meat samples (Cohen Stuart et al., 2012; Kawamura, 

258 

Goto, Nakane, & Arakawa, 2014; Nguyen et al., 2016). The high prevalence of blaCTX-M 

259 

seen in this study coincided with the report on community-acquired CTX-M-positive 

260 

infections in Thailand (Apisarnthanarak et al., 2007). For almost all ESBL-negative E. coli 

261 

isolates, resistance to cefoxitin was noted (Table 2) suggesting that AmpC may be 

262 

responsible for cefotaxime-resistant phenotypes. Accordingly, blaCMY-2 was found in 

263 

39.5% of ESBL-negative isolates.  

264 

For the rest of E. coli isolates, neither ESBL- nor AmpC-encoding genes were 

265 

detected and were not further investigated. It is possible that overexpression of 

266 

chromosomally-encoded AmpC b -lactamases, efflux pump overexpression or outer 

267 

membrane alteration may contribute to reduced susceptibility to antibiotics (Pitout, 2013). 

268 

It is also interesting to note that distribution of ESBL-genes was similar between open-air 

269 

and supermarkets. In contrast, blaCMY-2 was found more frequently in poultry meat taken 

270 

from open-air markets (Table 3). 

271 

272 

Conjugation experiments revealed that blaCTX-M and blaCMY-2 were successfully 

transferred to E. coli DH5a

 at high frequencies. The increased cefotaxime MICs in 

273 

transconjugants suggested that blaCTX-M and blaCMY-2 are responsible for cefotaxime

resistance. These results are consistent with the fact that horizontal gene transfer plays a 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

12

275 

major role in the spread of blaCTX-M and blaCMY-2 in E. coli (Woerther, Burdet, Chachaty, & 

276 

Andremont, 2013; Sidjabat et al., 2014). Genotypic analysis of blaCTX-M and blaCMY-2-

277 

positive E. coli by rep-PCR revealed the genetic diversity among these isolates. However, 

278 

identical genotypes were found among isolates carrying the same genes suggesting the 

279 

clonal spread of MDR E. coli in poultry meat samples. This observation is further 

280 

supported by the same genotypes being found in isolates obtained from open-air and 

281 

supermarkets. Moreover, we found 22 identical isolates carrying different blaCTX-M 

282 

inferring the recent transfer of blaCTX-M among dominant Thai E. coli clades. 

283 

Typing divided the E. coli isolates into 4 phylogenetic groups. Groups A and B1 

284 

constitute mainly the commensal strains while extra-intestinal pathogenic strains belong to 

285 

groups B2 and D (Clermont, Bonacorsi, & Bingen, 2000). In this study, the majority of E. 

286 

coli isolates carrying ESBL-genes (blaCTX-M, blaSHV or blaTEM) significantly belonged to 

287 

the low virulent groups A and B1. Similar results had been reported from E. coli isolates 

288 

recovered from poultry meat in Spain and the Netherlands (Egea et al., 2012; Kluytmans et 

289 

al., 2013). Our results suggest that E. coli isolates of the commensal origin may contribute 

290 

to the dissemination of MDR E. coli within the community. It is also interesting to note 

291 

that most blaCMY-2-positive E. coli belonged to phylogroup D, consistent with previous 

292 

reports (Oteo et al., 2010; Tamang et al., 2012).  

293 

Among the extraintestinal E. coli, O25b-ST 131, belonging to the phylogenetic 

294 

group B2, has emerged as a highly virulent human pathogen worldwide. E. coli O25b-

295 

ST131 usually exhibits multidrug resistance and produces various types of ESBLs and 

296 

AmpC. ST131 has been reported from different origins such as animals, environments and 

297 

humans. Although the widespread occurrence of E. coli ST131 has been documented, its 

298 

presence in raw meat is rare (Nicolas-Chanoine, Bertrand, & Madec, 2014). Previous 

299 

studies in the Netherlands and Spain which many ESBL-producing E. coli isolates from 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

13

300 

poultry meat were investigated but no ST131 was identified (Cohen Stuart et al., 2012; 

301 

Egea et al., 2012; Overdevest et al., 2011). However other studies in Italy, Japan and 

302 

Canada have reported the contamination of E. coli ST131 in poultry meat samples 

303 

(Ghodousi, Bonura, Di Noto, & Mammina, 2015; Kawamura, Goto, Nakane, & Arakawa, 

304 

2014; Vincent et al., 2010). In our study, 3 MDR E. coli isolates were identified as E. coli 

305 

B2-O25b ST131. Of these, 2 isolates were ESBL-negative and carried blaCMY-2. The other 

306 

ST131 isolate was an ESBL-positive and carried blaTEM-116, the infrequent ESBL-gene 

307 

found among ST131 isolates. In Thailand, all E. coli ST131 reported, to date, were 

308 

recovered from clinical specimen (Netikul et al., 2014). Given the fact that E. coli ST131 

309 

is associated predominantly with community-onset urinary tract infections, our finding of 

310 

ST131 isolates suggest that poultry meat could contribute to the dissemination of MDR 

311 

and virulent E. coli within Thai community. 

312 

Our data demonstrates that poultry meat in Thailand acts as a reservoir for MDR E. 

313 

coli especially those producing ESBL and AmpC. This is the first analysis of ESBL and 

314 

AmpC genes and the first discovery of human pathogen ST131 from Thai poultry meat. 

315 

Our results indicate that poultry meat may be a source of transmission of the MDR ST131 

316 

in Thailand.

High prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli in poultry meat in Thailand was observed. 

 

E. coli carrying blaCTX-M and blaCMY-2 isolates were found in poultry meat samples.  

 

Clonal spread of blaCTX-M and blaCMY-2-positive E. coli from poultry meat was detected. 

 

E. coli ST131 isolates carrying blaTEM-116 or blaCMY-2 have emerged from poultry meat.
