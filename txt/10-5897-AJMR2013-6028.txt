Isolation  of  multidrug  resistant  Escherichia  coli  from  diseased  livestock  is  becoming  rampart  from 
samples submitted for disease diagnostic purposes in some Tertiary Veterinary Teaching Hospitals in 
Nigeria. In order to evaluate the possible roles of commensal E. coli from apparently healthy animals in 
the  epidemiology  of  drug  resistant pathogens,  antibiotic  resistance  status of  240  E.  coli  isolated  from 
300  rectal  swab  from  apparently  healthy  cattle  from  a  major  cattle  market  in Ibadan, Oyo State,  South 
West Nigeria (a location very close to two of the Veterinary Teaching Hospitals), were grown aerobically 
at  breakpoint  concentration    for  ciprofloxacin,  cefepime,  chloramphenicol,  tetracycline,  ampicillin, 
kanamycin, streptomycin and nalidixic acid (all obtained from SIGMA-ALDRICH) according to standard 
method by Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute. A very high level of resistance was observed in all 
the antibiotics studied, with the highest resistance of 97% for kanamycin and 96.7, 95.8, 73.8, 72.5, 61.7, 
56.3 and 51.3% for ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, cefepime, nalidixic acid, streptomycin and 
ciprofloxacin, respectively. The high resistance observed in the commensal  E. coli could be attributed 
to  antibiotic  selective  pressure  due  to  often  abuse/misuse  of  the  drugs  on  the  cattle.  The  findings  in 
this  work  are  of  public  health  importance  because  these  multidrug  resistant  E.  coli  can  transmit 
resistance to other pathogenic bacteria of livestock and human pathogen. 
 
Key words: Antimicrobial, resistance, healthy cattle, isolated. 

 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Antibiotic  resistance  among  microorganisms  is  a  major 
problem,  both  in  human  and  livestock  industry.  And  the 
problem is usually attributed to unregulated and inappro-
priate  use  of  antibiotics  (Witte,  1998;  Lawson,  2008).  It 
has been  severally reported that commensal Escherichia 
coli  isolates  from  healthy  animals  like  cattle,  swine  as 
well  as  from  humans  play  significant  roles  in  the  perpe-
tration of drug resistant pathogens and subsequent infec-
tions (Hunter et al., 1993; Shanahan et al., 1995; Sunde 
and  Sⱷrum,  1999; Gulay et al., 2000; Kozak et al., 2009; 
  

Tian et al., 2012).  

In Nigeria livestock industry, the problem of occurrence 
of  multidrug  resistant  E.  coli  is  becoming  very  rampart, 
because they are often encountered in routine diagnoses 
of  disease  conditions  from  livestock  brought  for  con-
firmatory  diagnosis  in  microbiology  diagnostic  units  of 
some  Tertiary  Veterinary  Teaching  Hospitals  in  Nigeria 
(unpublished  data).  Earlier  in  Nigeria,  Ogunleye  et  al. 
(2008),  reported  nineteen  different  multidrug  resistant 
patterns  to  commonly  available  antibiotic  in  E.  coli

isolated from some diseased poultry samples from eleven 
poultry  farms  in  Abeokuta,  Ogun  State,  Nigeria.  The  39 
E. coli were isolated from various organs like liver, lungs, 
kidneys,  ovary,  intestine  and  colo-rectum  of  birds  that 
died  of  septicaemic  conditions.  Each  of  the  E.  coli 
isolates studied were resistant to between 5 and 12 com-
monly used antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin, cefuroxime, 
norfloxacin,  cotrimoxazole,  nalidixic  acid,  chloramphe-
nicol,  ampicilin,  ofloxacin,  penincilin  G,  amoxylin,  cloxa-
cilin and ciprofloxacin(Ogunleye et al., 2008). 

More recently, Ajayi et al. (2011) in a study, determined 
the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of commensal  E. coli 
from feaces of apparently healthy cattle in Ado Ekiti, Ekiti 
State Nigeria from ready to slaughter cattle. They observed 
74  different  multiple  antibiotic  resistance  patterns  in  the 
commonly  used  antibiotics,  and  81%  (851/1051)  of  the 
isolated  E.  coli  showed  resistance  to  at  least  3  of  the 
eight  antibiotics  tested,  while  20  isolates  showed  resis-
tance to all the eight antibiotics namely: ampicillin, cortri-
moxazole, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, colistin, 
streptomycin  and  tetracycline  (Ajayi  et  al.,  2011).  Sub-
sequently, from a group of 500 E. coli isolates tested  for 
susceptibilities  to  fluoroquinolones  (norfloxacin,  levoflo-
xacin, pefloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) and cepha-
losporin  group  of  drugs  (ceftazidime,  cefoxitin,  ceftria-
xone and aztreonam); the isolates were more sensitive to 
the cephalosporin group of drugs than to the fluoroquino-
lones based drugs (Ajayi et al., 2011).  

In another study from the South Eastern part of Nigeria, 
Nsofor and Iroegbu (2012), reported their observation on 
the  antibiotic  profiles  of  E.  coli  isolated  from  apparently 
healthy livestock like cattle, goat, poultry and swine. They 
observed  42  different  antibiotic  resistance  profiles,  with 
each isolates showing resistance to at least 4 or more of 
the antibiotics tested including: ampicilin, cortrimoxazole, 
cephalothin,  streptomycin,  nitrofurantoin, 
tetracycline, 
chloramphenicol,  amoxicillin-  clavulanic  acid,  cefpirome, 
cefpodoxime,  cefotaxime,  ceftriaxone,  cefoxitin,  nalidixic 
acid  and  gentamicin  (Nsofor  and  Iroegbu,  2012).  The 
current  study  was  carried  out  to  evaluate  the  current 
status  of  antibiotic  resistance  to  commonly  used  anti-
biotics among the E. coli isolates from apparently healthy 
cattle  at  a  major  cattle  market,  located  in  Ibadan,  Oyo 
State  Nigeria:  where  a  large  number  of  cities  and  towns 
in  the  South  Western  Nigeria  States  purchase  cattle  for 
slaughter  for  human  consumptions.  The  public  health 
implications of the findings were discussed. 
 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Sample collection/location 
 
A  total  of  300  rectal  swabs  were  sampled  from  apparently  healthy 
cattle  at  Akinyele  cattle  market  Ibadan,  Oyo  State,  Nigeria.  All  the 
cattle  sampled  belonged  to  three  indigenous  breeds  namely: 
‘Sokoto  Gudali’,  ‘White  Fulani’  and  ‘Kuri’,  and  all  fall  between  two 
and five years. The cattle market is one of the biggest in the South 
Western  Nigeria.  Cattle  sold  in  the  market  were  usually  brought 
from the Northern States of Nigeria such as Borno, Sokoto, Kaduna, 

Ogunleye et al.          4573 

 
 
 
 Kano, Niger and Kebbi States and sometimes from the neighboring 
West  African  countries  like  Niger  Republic,  Chad  Republic  and 
occasionally from  Cameroon. Antibiotics usage  is  a common  prac-
tice  while  transporting  the  cattle  to  the  site  and  also  during  the 
transient period  between the  arrival  of the cattle to the market  and 
the  time  of  sales  to  cattle  butchers  and  other  end  users  for  slau-
ghter. Some of the antibiotics reported to be commonly used both in 
transit  as  well  as  during  the  time  lag  between  the  arrival  of  the 
cattle at the market and the time of sales for slaughter include: oxy-
tetracycline (short acting) injectable, procaine  - penicillin injectable, 
streptomycin  injectable  and  occasionally  penincillin-streptomycin 
injectable.  The  samples  were  collected  between  March  and  June, 
2012. 
 
 
Bacteriological analysis  
 
Rectal  swab  samples  were  streaked  on  MacConkey  agar  and 
incubated  aerobically  at  37°C  for  24  to  48  h.  All  the  isolates  that 
fermented  lactose  were  sub  cultured  onto  Eosin  Methylene  Blue 
agar  (EMB)  and  incubated  at  37°C  for  24  to  48  h.  All  the  isolates 
that produced typical metallic - sheen on EMB were further subjec-
ted to morphological and biochemical analysis by standard methods 
(Barrow and Felthams, 1993; Garcia and Isenberg, 2007). Antibiotic 
resistant  pattern  of  two  hundred  and  forty  E.  coli  isolated  from  the 
samples  were  grown  aerobically  in  breakpoint  concentration  of  8 
µg/ml  for  ciprofloxacin,  and  32  µg/ml  for  each  of:  cefepime,  chlo-
ramphenicol,  tetracycline,  ampicillin,  kanamycin,  streptomycin  and 
nalidixic  acid  (all  obtained  from  SIGMA-ALDRICH)  according  to 
standard  method  (CLSI,  2009).  Resistance  was  ascribed  if  floccu-
lent growth was observed after 16 h of aerobic growth at 37°C. 
 
 
RESULTS 
 
E. coli were isolated in 240/300(80%) of the rectal swabs 
processed. As shown in Table 1 and Figure 1, the highest 
resistance  of 97% at the antibiotic breakpoint concentra-
tion was observed in kanamycin, followed closely by 96.7 
and  95.8%  for  ampicillin  and  chloramphenicol,  respec-
tively. The following percentage resistance  of 73.8, 72.5, 
61.7,  56.3  and  51.3%  were  observed  for  tetracycline, 
cefepime,  nalidixic  acid,  streptomycin  and  ciprofloxacin, 
respectively.  Table  1  and  Figure  2  show  the  sensitivity 
pattern  and  proportions  of  the  tested  E.  coli  to  the  anti-
biotic.  Of  all  the  antibiotics  tested,  ciprofloxacin  was  the 
most  sensitive  with  48.7%  sensitivity,  while  kanamycin 
with 3.0% sensitivity was the least sensitive. 
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
In  recent  times,  multidrug  resistant  E.  coli  are  often  iso-
lated  from  disease  conditions  from  livestock  during  rou-
tine  diagnosis  in  some  diagnostic  units  of  some  Tertiary 
Veterinary  Teaching  Hospitals  in  Nigeria  (unpublished 
data).  The  possible  roles  of  multidrug  resistant  E.  coli 
from healthy animals in the transfer of drug resistance to 
pathogenic  bacteria  in  animal  and  humans  have  been 
acknowledged  (Gulay  et  al.,  2000;  Kozak  et  al.,  2009; 
Tian  et  al.,  2012).  The  occurrence  of  high  level  of  anti-
biotic  resistance  obtained  from  the  E.  coli  from  healthy 
cattle  studied  gives  an  indication  of  the  possible  roles

of  these  bacteria  in  the  transfer  of  the  commonly 
observed  resistance  among  pathogenic  E.  coli  from 
livestock  in  Nigeria.  The  high  level  of  drug  resistance 
obtained  from  E.  coli  isolated  from  apparently  healthy 
cattle  in  this  study  is  comparable  with  the  findings  of 
other  workers  in  E.  coli  isolates  from  healthy  livestock 
from  some  other  parts  and  locations  in  Nigeria.  For 
instance, using a disk diffusion method, Ajayi et al. (2011) 
reported  67.6%  (710/1051)  resistance  for  streptomycin 
among  E.  coli  isolated  from  apparently  healthy  cattle 
ready for slaughter in Ekiti State, Nigeria, and 62.5%(n = 
80)  from  livestock  in  the  South  Eastern  Nigeria  (Nsofor 
and  Iroegbu,  2012),  while  in  the  current  work  using 
antibiotic breakpoint method, 56.3% (135/240) resistance 
was  obtained  for  streptomycin.  The  percentage  resis-
tance  in  the  current  work  for  tetracycline  and  ampicillin 
were also comparable to the findings of Ajayi et al. (2011) 
and  that  of  Nsofor  and  Iroegbu  (2012).  For  tetracycline, 
there  was  73.8%  (177/240)  resistance  in  the  current 
work; 64.3% (676/1051) for Ajayi et al. (2011), 68.8% (n = 
80)  for  Nsofor  and  Iroegbu  (2012).  For  ampicillin,  there 
was  96.7%  (232/240)  resistance  in  the  current  work, 
85.3% (896/1051) in Ajayi et al. (2011) and 85% (n = 80) 
from the work of Nsofor and Iroegbu (2012). 

The highest level of resistance in the commensal E. coli 
studied  by  Ajayi  et  al.  (2011)  in  cattle  at  Ekiti  State  was 
88.1%  (892/1051)  in  gentamicin.  However,  gentamicin 
was  not  part  of  the  antibiotics  used  for  the  breakpoint 
determination, but among the antibiotic studied,  kanamy-
cin  produced  the  highest  resistance  of  97%  followed 
closely  by  ampicillin  96.7%  and  chloramphenicol  95.8%. 
And unlike the work of Ajayi et al. (2011), where nalidixic 
acid  produced  the least  percentage  of  resistance  of   9% 
(95/1051),  a  higher  resistance  of  61.7%  (148/240)  was 
recorded  at  the  breakpoint  concentration  for  the  E.  coli 
isolates  in  this  study.  The  high  level  of  resistance 
obtained  for  the  representative  antibiotics  of  the  fluoro-
quinolone  (ciprofloxacin)  51.3%  and  the  3rd  generation 
cephalosporin  (cefepime)  72.5%  are  also  noteworthy 
because of their importance as drug of choice in treating 
life  threatening  bacterial  infections  in  livestock  and 
human.  Indiscriminate  use  of  antibiotics  without  cogent 
indication  for  its  use  is  a  common  practice  while  trans-
porting  the  cattle  from  the  Northern  part  of  the  country 
and  from  the  neighboring  West  African  countries  to  this 
cattle market. Through interaction with the cattle dealers, 
it  was  also  discovered  that  they  were  fond  of  using  cer-
tain  antibiotics  routinely.  For  example,  streptomycin

is  often  used  without  prescriptions  any  time  they  found 
any  of  the  animals  coughing,  oxytetracycline  during  cold 
seasons  and  penicillin-streptomycin  for  all  manner  of 
infections,  all  these  without  careful  attention  to  adminis-
tration  of  correct  dose/dosages  nor  based  on  veterinary 
prescriptions.  These  unwholesome  practices  must  have 
contributed  to  the  presence  of  high  level  of  the  drug 
resistant  E.  coli  isolated  from  the  healthy  cattle  studied 
due  to  antibiotics  selective  pressure.  The  large  percent-
tages  of  the  bacteria  studied  is  not  susceptible  at  the 
respective  breakpoints  of  the  studied  antibiotics  which  is 
an  indication  of  their  tolerance  to  the  antibiotics  and 
possibility  of  difficulty  in  treating  possible  infections  by 
these organisms by the antibiotics concerned (Rodriguez-
Bano et al., 2011). Since there is the possibility of acqui-
sition  of  drug  resistance  mechanism  through  interbac-
terial transfer (Falagas et al., 2012), the current work thus 
underscores the public health risk of the possible transfer 
of  this  high  drug  resistant  trait  from  this  apparently  non- 
pathogenic  E.  coli  to  pathogenic  animal  pathogens  as 
well as to humans.
