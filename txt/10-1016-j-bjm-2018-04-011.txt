Avian  pathogenic  Escherichia  coli  (APEC)  isolates  from  apparently  healthy  free  range  helmeted
guineafowl  were  characterized.  Most  of  them  had  a  high  frequency  of  virulence  associ-
ated  genes,  multi  drug  resistance  and  high  pathogenicity.  We   demonstrated  that  helmeted
guineafowl  have  potential  to  transmit  antibiotic  resistant  APEC  to  other  species  including
humans.

The  Avian  Pathogenic  Escherichia  coli 
(APEC)  strains  are
responsible  for  a  large  number  of  extra-intestinal  diseases  in
birds,  either  locally  or  as  systemic  infections;  those  are  the  so
called  avian  colibacillosis  and  are  responsible  for  economic
losses  for  the  world’s  poultry  industries.1 In  addition,  APEC
strains  are  a  subpathotype  of  pathogenic  extra-intestinal
bacteria  (ExPEC),  category  responsible  for  diseases  in  humans

and  animals  such  as  urinary  tract  infection  (UTI),  neonatal
meningitis  and  septicemia,2 suggesting  that  APEC  strains
may  be  a  potential  zoonotic  pathogens.3

Healthy  birds  can  eliminate  strains  that  harbors  virulence
genes  to  the  environment,  thus  becoming  a  sources  of  infec-
tion  to  other  animals  and  to  humans.4,5 In  this  regard,  the
increase  of  drug  resistant  strains,  due  to  the  indiscriminate

use  of  antibiotics  in  animal  production,  can  transfer  resistance
genes  to  other  bacteria  of  the  environment  and  to  normal
human  microbiota.6–8

There  is  no  consensus  in  the  literature  to  deﬁne  the
APEC  pathotype  and  the  development  of  methodologies  for
its  diagnosis  are  fault;  mainly  due  to  it  be  a  very  heteroge-
neous  group  of  microorganisms,  in  which  different  isolates
can  harbor  a  different  associations  of  virulence  factors  (VFs),
each  capable  of  inducing  avian  colibacillosis.9 Also,  free-range
chickens  and  human  often  share  the  same  environment,
in  this  sense,  these  birds  and  their  products 
(meat  and
eggs)  can  act  as  ExPEC  sources  of  infection  to  humans.10
Like  any  source  of  animal  protein,  helmeted  guineafowl
may  act  as  a  possible  carrier  of  pathogenic  microorgan-
isms  to  humans;  however,  until  now,  no  studies  focused
on  this  species  as  been  possible  carriers.  Thus,  we  per-
formed  this  study  to  detect  and  characterize  drug-resistant
pathogenic  E.  coli  carrying  virulence  genes  related  to  APEC
pathotype  in  free-range  helmeted  guineafowl  and  clariﬁed
how  these  birds  can  be  relevant  in  humans  and  other  animal’s
infections.

This  study  was  approved  by  the  Committee  on  Ethics  for
the  Use  of  Animals  of  (CEUA),  protocol  number  19.008/16.  Sam-
ples  were  collected  from  56  free  range  helmeted  guineafowl
without  history  of  the  use  of  antibiotics,  of  unknown  genetic
origin  and  of  different  age  groups  from  4  small  farms  in
Jaboticabal  city,  Sao  Paulo  State,  Brazil.  In  the  ﬁrst  farm  6
samples  was  collected,  12  samples  in  the  second  farm,  48  sam-
ples  in  the  third  farm  and  46  in  the  fourth  farm,  totalizing
56  samples  from  the  cloaca  and  56  from  the  oropharyn-
ges  that  were  obtained  with  the  aid  of  sterile  swabs,  which
were  placed  in  sterile  tubes,  containing  5  mL   of  BHI  broth
(Brain  Heart  Infusion)  and  kept  in  under  refrigeration  until
processed.

From  the  swabs  inoculated  into  BHI  and  incubated  at
◦
37
C  for  16  h,  a  Polymerase  Chain  Reaction  (PCR)  screen-
ing  was  performed  for  the  detection  of  the  cvaC,  iroN,  iss,
iutA,  ompT  and  hlyF  genes.  Protocols  for  the  DNA  tem-
plate  preparation,  PCR  and  primer  oligonucleotides 
for
these  genes  were  taken  from  the  EcL  protocol,  available  at
http://www.apzec.ca/en/APZEC/Protocols/APZEC  PCR  en.aspx.
Then,  samples  that  were  positive  for  at  least  ﬁve  of  the  above
cited  genes  were  used  to  detect  E.  coli  isolates.11,12 In  addition,
obtained  isolates  were  subjected  to  a  new  PCRs  to  detect  the
following  additional  11  virulence  genes:  sitA,  tsh,   traT,  vat,
astA,  iucC,  iucD,  papC,  irp2,  ﬁmH  and  fyuA.  The  frequencies
of  VAGs  were  compared  with  Fisher’s  exact  test  using  Prism
for  Windows  version  6.01  (GraphPad  Software).  Associations
were  considered  statistically  signiﬁcant 
if  the  calculated
P-value  was  <0.05.

E.  coli  phylogroups  were  typing  by  PCR  phylotyping  method
of  Clermont  et  al.  (2013)13 targeting  chuA  and  yjaA  genes
and  TspE4.C2  DNA  fragment.  Serotyping  of  the  APEC  strains
were  performed  using  somatic  (O1-O181)  and  ﬂagellar  (H1-
H56)  antigens  that  were  produced  at  the  Bacteriology  Center
of  the  Adolfo  Lutz  Institute  –  Sao  Paulo,  Brazil.  Additionally,
the  isolates  antimicrobial  susceptibility  was  performed  by
disc  diffusion  method.14 Antimicrobials  tested  were:  ampi-

Pathogenicity  test  was  determined  according  to  Guastalli
et  al.  (2013).20 Bacterial  culture  (0.1  ml)   was  inoculated  into
the  left  thoracic  air  sac  of  day-old  chicks.  For  inoculum  prepa-
ration,  a  colony  of  each  bacterial  strain  was  seeded  in  10  ml
of  BHI  broth,  incubated  for  18  h  at  37
C  and  subsequently
diluted  to  a  1:10  ratio.  Inoculum  concentration  was  standard-
ized  to  107 CFU/mL.  The  E.  coli  (serogroup  O1)  belonging  the
Laboratory  of  Ornithopathology  of  USP,  was  used  as  a  posi-
tive  control.  Negative  control  birds  were  inoculated  with  BHI
broth  only.  For  each  strain,  as  well  as  for  the  negative  and
positive  control  groups,  ten  male  chicks  from  a  commercial
lineage  were  used.  The  strains  were  classiﬁed  due  to  its  mor-
tality  as  follow:  high  (≥80%),  intermediate  (>50%  and  <80%),
low  pathogenicity  (≤50%)  and  non-pathogenic  (zero  mortal-
ity).

Genomic  DNA  digestion  with  XbaI  (Invitrogen,  USA)  was
performed  as  described  by  Ribot  et  al.  (2006)21 with  modiﬁca-
tions  and  a  Salmonella  Braenderup  H9812  strain  was  used  as
a  molecular  weight  reference.  The  electrophoresis  occurred
at  14
C,  on  a  1%  Pulsiﬁeld  Certiﬁed  agarose  gel,  with  initial
−1,
time  of  2.2  s,  ﬁnal  time  of  54.2  s,  on  a  gradient  of  6  V  cm  x
◦
an  angle  of  120
,  for  23  h.  The  fragments  similarity  was  com-
pared  using  the  Dice  coefﬁcient  at  1%  tolerance  and  0.5%
optimization  and  the  dendrogram  was  calculated  using  the
neighbor  joining  method  with  BioNumerics  software  ver-
sion  7.1  (Applied  Maths,  Sint-Martens-Latem,  Belgium).  The
housekeeping  genes  adk,  fumC,  gyrB,  icd,   mdh,  purA  and  recA
were  ampliﬁed  by  PCR  for  the  MSLT  analysis.  These  genes
were  chosen  based  on  the  MLST  protocol  for  E.  coli  from  the
University  of  Warwick,  USA.22 The  speciﬁc  oligonucleotide
as  well  as 
the  PCR  ampliﬁcation  conditions  are  avail-
able  at  http://mlst.warwick.ac.uk/mlst/dbs/Ecoli/documents/
primersColi  html.  The  PCR  products  were  sequenced  in  an
(Applied  Biosystems,  Waltham,  USA)
ABI  3100  sequencer 
with  Big  Dye  Terminator  v3.1  kit 
(Applied  Biosystems,
Waltham,  USA).  The  resulting  sequences  were  analyzed  by  the
Phred/Phrap/Consed  program  package.23–25

All  the  results  are  shown  in  Fig.  1.  From  the  112  samples,
21  isolates  were  obtained,  20  were  from  cloaca  and  one  from
the  oropharynx.  These  isolates  were  positive  for  at  least  ﬁve
of  the  APEC  related  genes  (cvaC,  hlyF,  iss,   iroN,  ompT  and  iutA)
and  were,  further,  subjected  to  another  PCR  for  the  detection
of  additional  virulence  genes.  Isolated  E.  coli  gene  proﬁle  is
described  at  Table  1.

Phylogenetic  analysis  revealed  that  most  of  the  isolates
(33.3%)  belong  to  group  B1,  followed  by  groups  A  (19.0%),  D
(14.3%),  B2  (9.5%),  F  (9.5%)  and  C  (4.8%)  and  that  two   isolates
(4  and  7)  could  not  be  typed.  Isolates  belonging  to  groups  B2
and  F  were  associated  with  a  higher  number  of  virulence  fac-
tors,  with  a  mean  of  14.5  and  13.5  per  isolate  of  each  group,
respectively.

A  single  isolate  showed  resistance  to  only  one  antimicro-
bial.  The  remaining  20  isolates  were  resistance  to  at  least
three  antimicrobial  simultaneously  and  19  of  these  isolates
were  resistant  to  three  or  more   antimicrobial  classes,  which
represent  90.4%  of  multi  drug  resistant.  The  highest  drug  resis-
tance  was  found  against  cephalotin  (100.0%),  streptomycin
(90.5%),  ampicillin  (71.4%)  and  tetracycline  (61.9%).  As  for  the
antimicrobial  classes,  42.8%  of  the  isolates  were  resistant  to
penicillins,  32.2%  to  cephalosporins  and  40.5%  to  aminoglyco-
sides.  ESBL  genes  for  blaTEM were  found  in  resistant  isolates  3,
4,  9,  19  and  21  and  blaSHV in  isolates  5  and  20.

Thirteen  of  the  21  samples  analyzed  were  O  antigen  typable
(61.9%)  and  were  within  the  following  six  serogroups:  O2
(14.3%),  O51  (19.0%),  O11  (9.5%),  O7  (3.2%),  O8  (3.2%)  and
O9  (3.2%).  Of  the  remaining  strains,  seven  (33.3%)  were  non
typable  (NT)  and  two  (9.5%)  could  not  be  characterized  due
to  its  rough-looking  colonies  (RL).  The  H  antigen  could  not  be
determined  in  six  samples  (28.5%)  due  to  they  been  immobile
(IS).  The  other  16  (76.2%)  strains  were  typable  and  ﬁve  anti-
gens  were  identiﬁed:  H4  (28.5%),  H14  (23.8%),  H25  (9.5%),  H9
(3.2%)  and  H10  (3.2%).  The  most  prevalent  O:H  serotypes  were:
O51:H14  (19.0%)  and  NT:IS  (19.0%)

(MP),  three 

(14.8%)  strains  were 

The  pathogenicity  test  revealed  that  14  (66.6%)  strains
were  highly  pathogenic  (HP),  three  (14.8%)  strains  were  inter-
mediate  pathogenic 
low
pathogenic  (LP)  and  one  (4.7%)  was  a  nonpathogenic  (NP)
strain.  It  was  observed  that  all  of  the  birds  in  the  positive
control  group  died,  while  all  birds  of  the  negative  control
group  lived.  The  clinical  signs  and  macroscopic  lesions  were
observed  with  higher  frequency  with  high  and  intermediate
pathogenic  strains.  None  of  the  VAGs  were  statistically  signif-
icant  to  differentiated  HP/MP  from  LP/NP  strains  based  Fisher’s
test.

The  dendogram  showed  two  large  clusters  with  three  sub-
divisions  and  the  21  possible  APEC  isolates  generated  18
different  pulsotypes,  of  which  only  three  were  shared,  those
been:  1  and  2,  10  and  11,  13  and  15.  Sixteen  sequence  types
(ST)  were  identiﬁed  as  follow:  ST  624,  ST  58,  ST  1406,  ST  46,  ST
88,  ST  6496,  ST  155,  ST  1727,  ST  93,  ST  3851,  ST  3580,  ST  117,  ST
83,  ST  641  and  a  new  one  (ST)  that  corresponded  to  the  isolate
21.

There  are  no  data  about  helmeted  guineafowl  potential  as
sources  of  APEC  infection  for  other  animals.  Moreover  APEC
virulence  mechanisms  are  not  yet  fully  understood  and  it  is
known  that  APEC  strains  have  different  virulence  proﬁles  that
correlate  to  the  animal  species  and  the  region  in  which  it
was  isolated.12,26,27 In  several  studies  authors  have  shown  that
APEC-related  genes  iutA,  hlyF,  iss,   iron,  ompT  and  cvaC  occur
more   frequently  and  are  associated  with  highly  pathogenic
strains.12,28,29 All  21  isolates  showed  at  least  ﬁve  of  these
and  others  important  genes  associates  with  ExPEC  that  have
been  detected  in  other  animals  like  pigeons30 and  humans.31
These  ﬁndings  suggest  that  wild  and  domestic  bird  may  act
as  sources  of  human  pathogenic  E.  coli,  thus  reinforcing  its
zoonotic  nature.3

Most  of  the  isolates  were  found  highly  pathogenic  by  the
pathogenicity  test,  with  low  and  intermediate  pathogenic
strains  composing  only  29.6%  and  only  one  isolate  was  non-
pathogenic.  The  high  number  of  high  pathogenic  isolates  in
apparently  healthy  birds  can  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that
these  genes  were  not  expressed  because  according  to  Won
et  al.  (2009),32 the  pathogenicity  of  APEC  is  based  not  only  on
the  gene  presence,  but  also  on  its  expression.  In  addition,  APEC
infections  are  multifactorial  and  highly  dependent  on  the
microorganism/host  interactions,  which  develop  secondarily

to  other  factors,  such  as  poor  environmental  and  handling
conditions  and  pre-existent  infections  that  can  affect  the  host
immune  system  or  the  respiratory  epithelium.32,33 It  is  also
worth  mentioning  that  a  signiﬁcant  genetic  material  exchange
between  bacteria  may  occur,  making  possible  that  horizontal
gene  transfer  from  pathogenic  to  non-pathogenic  strain  lead
to  the  emergence  of  new  virulent  strains  between  the  normal
human  microbiota.7

Of  today  concern  is  the  fact  that  a  large  number  of  E.  coli
strains  causing  human  infections,  including  those  resistant  to
antimicrobials,  are  of  animal  origin.5,34 According  to  Mellata
et  al.  (2013),35 E.  coli  samples  isolated  from  birds  are  commonly
resistant  to  more   than  one  antimicrobial.  This  proﬁle  was  also
over  served  here  with  95.2%  of  the  isolates  exhibiting  resis-
tance  to  at  least  three  antimicrobials,  fact  similar  to  others
studies.36,37 The  highest  drug  resistance  was  observed  against
cephalothin,  streptomycin,  ampicillin  and  tetracycline  which
are  the  most  commonly  used  antibiotics  in  human  infections.
In  addition,  ﬁnding  ESBL  genes  in  these  animals  is  a  concern
because  transmission  of  ESBL  isolates  between  humans  and
other  species  has  been  reported.38

Phylogenetic  analysis  revealed  that  most  of  the  isolates
from  groups  B1,  and  B2  and  F  strains  have  a  highest  num-
ber  of  VAGs.  Although  recent  studies  that  utilize  the  updated
method  by  Clermont  et  al.  (2013)13 are  scarce,  Logue  et  al.
(2017)39 classiﬁed  APEC  isolates  according  to  the  new  phy-
logenetic  typing  and  concluded  that  strains  in  A  and  B1
group  were  of  lower  pathogenic  potential.  In  contrast,  in
this  study,  three  samples  from  group  A  were  classiﬁed  as
high  pathogenic  and  one  as  intermediate.  The  only  non-
pathogenic  strain  belonged  to  the  B1  group,  as  well  as  a
low  pathogenicity  strain  and,  interestingly,  two  intermedi-
ate  pathogenicity  strains  and  three  high  pathogenic  strains
were  included  in  this  group.  Thus,  it  was  noticed  that  strains
of  low  and  high  pathogenic  potential  can  be  of  the  same
phylogenetic  group  and  more   studies  are  needed  in  order  to
clarify,  effectively,  the  phylogeny  relationship  of  APEC  iso-
lates.

Strains  involved  in  colibacillosis  are  often  associated  with
three  major  serogroups:  O1,  O2  and  O78,  with  the  other  ones
been  sporadic,  but  also  occurring.3,40 In  this  study,  14.3%  of
the  isolated  belonged  to  the  O2  group,  which  is  in  agree-
ment  with  Schouler  et  al.  (2012),9 whose  study  found  out
that  this  serogroup  harbored  mainly  pathogenic  samples.  In
our  ﬁndings,  all  O2  samples  were  pathogenic.  In  addition,
the  serogroup  H4  was  the  most  commonly  found,  with  the
O51:H14  serotype  has  been  the  most  prevalent.

PFGE  analysis  revealed  a  great  intra-speciﬁc  variability.
Among  the  isolates  that  shared  the  same  pulsotype,  samples
1  and  2,  from  the  same  animal,  have  genetic  similarities  and
shared  the  other  evaluated  characteristics  but  differ  among
themselves  in  the  presence  of  the  cvaC.  Isolates  13  and  15,
which  were  from  the  same  animal,  had  a  similar  genotypic
proﬁle,  pathogenicity  and  phylogeny,  but  they  had  differences
in  others  parameters.  Samples  10  and  11,  isolated  from  differ-
ent  birds,  were  similar  in  all  characteristics  and,  possibly,  there
are  bacterial  clones.  These  results  that  can  be  explained  by  the
fact  that  these  birds  share  the  same  environment  and  were
in  close  proximity,  facilitating  genetic  material  exchange,7
fact  that  suggesting  the  possibility  of  free-range  helmeted

guineafowl  to  transmit  potential  APEC  strains  to  other  animals
including  humans.

Sixteen  sequence  types  (ST)  were  identiﬁed  of  21  isolates,
a  new  ST,  corresponding  to  isolate  21,  which  differed  in  only
one  locus  from  the  ST  155  (data  not  shown).  There  was  sim-
ilarity  among  isolates  which  share  the  same  ST  as  well  as
between  isolates  with  different  STs.  In  general,  phylogenetic
analysis  by  MLST  has  shown  that,  in  fact,  APEC  constitutes  a
heterogeneous  group,  fact  that  was  also  observed  in  another
study.41

Maluta  et  al.  (2014)29 veriﬁed  that  APEC  and  ExPEC  in
humans  can  shared  ST  155,  ST  88  and  ST  117,  which  were
found  in  free-range  helmeted  guineafowl,  with  the  ST  117,
being  the  most  common  among  isolates  related  to  intensive
care  units.  The  ST  46  and  ST  83,  also  associated  with  humans
and  other  animals  like  dogs42 and  cats43 was  found  in  this
study  too.  Helmetd  guineafowl  APEC  isolates  sharing  the  same
phylogenetic  background  with  ExPec  strains  proves  that  these
animals  can  be  a  source  of  infection  in  humans  and  other
animals,  include  pet  companions.

The  diversity  of  factors  combinations  that  may  lead  to
virulence  and  to  antimicrobials  resistance  reveals  the  great
importance  of  APEC  zoonotic  potential.  Our  data  showed  that
healthy  free-range  helmeted  guineafowl  are  an  underesti-
mated  how  natural  reservoirs  of  APEC  with  high  pathogenic
potential  and  multi  drug  resistance.  This 
is  aggravated
because  of  the  fact  that  these  bacteria  can  be  eliminated  by
the  respiratory  tract  and  by  feces,  thus  making  these  birds
a  sources  of  infection  of  ExPEC  to  other  animals,  including
humans.
