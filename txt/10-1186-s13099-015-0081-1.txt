Abstract 
Background:  The worldwide increase of food-borne infections with antibiotic resistant pathogens constitutes a 
major public health problem. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence, antibiogram, virulence genes 
profiles and integron characteristics of non-typhoidal Salmonella spp. isolated from poultry meat and diarrhoeic 
patients in Egypt.
Methods:  A total of 150 samples comprising (100 poultry meat and 50 diarrhoeic patients’ stool) were examined for 
the presence of Salmonella spp. using culture methods followed by biochemical and serological identification of the 
isolates. All Salmonella strains were tested for their susceptibility to the antibiotics using disk diffusion method and 
screened for the presence of virulence genes and class I integrons using PCR.
Results:  The overall prevalence of Salmonella spp. in poultry meat samples was 10 % compared to 4 % in diarrhoeic 
patients. All the isolates were serologically identified into Salmonella Typhimurium (seven isolates), S. Derby, S. Kiel, 
S. Rubislaw (one isolate, each) and untypable strains (two isolates). Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed a higher 
resistance of the total isolates to erythromycin and tetracycline (100 %, each), followed by amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 
(91.7 %), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (83.3 %), streptomycin, nalidixic acid, ampicillin-sulbactam (75 %, each), gen-
tamycin, ampicillin (66.7 %, each), chloramphenicol (58.3 %), ciprofloxacin (25 %) and ceftriaxone (16.7 %). Virulence 
genes profiles revealed the presence of sopB gene in five Salmonella strains isolated from poultry meat (n = 3) and 
humans (n = 2). Moreover, pefA was only identified in three isolates from poultry meat. On the other hand, S. Kiel and 
S. Typhimurium (one isolate, each) were harboring hilA and stn genes, respectively. Class 1 integrons were detected in 
all Salmonella spp. with variable amplicon sizes ranged from 650–3000 bp. Sequencing of these amplicons revealed 
the presence of gene cassettes harboring aac(3)-Id, aadA2, aadA4, aadA7, sat, dfrA15, lnuF and estX resistance genes. 
Nucleotide sequence analysis showed point mutations in the aac(3)-Id of S. Derby, aadA2, estX-sat genes of S. Typh-
imurium. Meanwhile, frame shift mutation was observed in aadA7 genes of S. Typhimurium.
Conclusions:  Increasing rate of antimicrobial resistance and class 1 integrons among multidrug resistant Salmonella 
spp. has prompted calls for the reduction of antimicrobial use in livestock to prevent future emergence of resistance.

Background
Non-typhoidal  Salmonella  (NTS)  is  one  of  the  major 
zoonotic  food-borne  pathogens  representing  an  impor-
tant  public  health  problem  worldwide.  It  can  cause  a 
variety of clinical manifestations ranging from mild gas-
troenteritis to bacteraemia and extra intestinal localized 
infections involving many organs. The global burden of 
NTS gastroenteritis has been estimated to be 93.8 mil-
lion  cases  of  gastroenteritis  each  year  with  155,  000 
deaths  annually  [1].  Food  of  animal  origin  especially 
poultry meat is considered to be one of the major vehi-
cles  of  Salmonella  infections  in  humans  and  has  been 
implicated  in  outbreaks  of  human  salmonellosis  [2]. 
Antimicrobial  resistance  and  virulence  of  Salmonella 
strains play a vital role in systemic infections. Salmonella 
pathogenicity is dictated by an array of factors encoded 
by  virulence  genes  that  assist  the  organism  to  express 
its virulence in the host cells and ultimately manifest in 
the  typical  symptoms  of  salmonellosis.  Some  genes  are 
known to be involved in adhesion and invasion includ-
ing; plasmid encoded fimbriae (pefA) and hyper invasive 
locus (hilA) [3, 4]. Salmonella outer proteins (sop A-E) 
encoded by sop gene and (stn) codes for enterotoxin pro-
ductions are associated with the actual manifestation of 
pathogenic  processes  [5].  In  addition  to  virulence  fac-
tors,  the  emergence  of  antimicrobial  resistance  among 
NTS  has  become  a  public  health  threat.  Since  food  of 
animal  origin  is  a  major  source  of  Salmonella  spp.,  it 
has been suggested that abundant use of antimicrobials 
in food animals’ production may contribute to the pres-
ence of antimicrobial resistance in these species and sub-
sequently transferred to humans through food chain [6]. 
Factors  contributed  to  the  resistance  and  virulence  of 
Salmonella may be located on chromosomes, plasmids, 
transposon and integrons. Integrons are DNA elements 
that can transfer antibiotic resistance genes among bac-
teria.  Class  I  integrons  are  the  most  common  type  of 
integrons  recognized  among  the  multidrug  resistant 

(MDR)  Salmonella  and  have  conserved  regions  (5′-CS 
and 3′-CS) which often contain gene cassettes [7]. These 
cassettes  contain  genes  that  confer  resistance  to  anti-
microbial  agents  including  aminoglycosides,  b-lactams, 
chloramphenicol and trimethoprim as well as genes that 
confer resistance to antiseptics and disinfectants [8]. The 
present study was undertaken to (i) trace the prevalence 
and  antimicrobial  susceptibility  patterns  of  NTS  enter-
ica serotypes isolated from poultry meat and diarrhoeic 
patients  (ii)  ascertain  the  presence  of  virulence  genes 
and  class  I  integrons  using  PCR  (iii)  sequencing  of  the 
amplified  DNA  fragments  of  class  I  integrons  in  order 
to identify the resistance genes located in integron gene 
cassettes.

Results and discussion
Prevalence of Salmonella serovars in poultry meat 
and diarrhoeic patients
In the present study, the overall prevalence of Salmonella 
spp.  in  the  total  examined  poultry  meat  samples  was 
10 % (Table 1). This result was compatible with previous 
studies in Nepal [9]. Moreover, our results regarding the 
prevalence  of  Salmonella  spp.  in  broiler  chicken  meat 
(14 %) substantiate the findings of others in Canada [10].
Serotyping  of  Salmonella  spp.  isolated  from  poultry 
meat in this study revealed the predominance of S. Typh-
imurium  in  chicken  meat  and  this  was  in  concordance 
with previous studies from India [11]. Additionally, other 
serovars such as S. Rubislaw, S. Kiel (chicken meat) and S. 
Derby (duck meat) were identified.

It was obvious from Table 1 that 4 % (2 out of 50) of 
stool  samples  from  diarrhoeic  patients  were  positive 
for  Salmonella  spp.  and  S.  Typhimurium  was  the  only 
serotype  identified.  Nearly  similar  prevalence  in  diar-
rhoeic patients was reported in India [12]. The isolation 
of  S.  Derby  from  poultry  meat  and  humans  has  been 
previously  recorded  in  Netherlands  [13].  Moreover,  S. 
Rubislaw was isolated from chicken meat in Senegal and

diarrhoeic children in Gambia [14] and this confirms the 
zoonotic importance of the former serotypes.

Antibiotic susceptibility testing
All Salmonella isolates were tested for their susceptibil-
ity  towards  antimicrobial  drugs  (Table  2).  The  results 
highlighted  the  higher  resistance  of  the  isolates  to 
erythromycin  and  tetracycline  (100  %,  each),  followed 
by  amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid  (91.7  %),  trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole  (83.3  %),  streptomycin,  nalidixic  acid, 
ampicillin-sulbactam (75 %, each), gentamycin, ampicil-
lin (66.7 %, each), chloramphenicol (58.3 %), ciprofloxa-
cin (25 %) and ceftriaxone (16.7 %). This isn’t surprising 
because these antibiotics are cheap, easily affordable and 
commonly used in humans and poultry without prescrip-
tion. In poultry, these drugs are used either for therapeu-
tic purposes or as growth promoters added to the feed 
leading  to  the  development  of  resistance  in  the  enteric 
bacterial  flora  of  poultry.  Subsequently  the  pathogenic 
bacteria such as Salmonella may acquire resistance from 
this enteric flora and transfer this resistance to human’s 
strains through food chain leading to the emergence of 
MDR Salmonella strains that constitute a public health 
risk and potentially affect the efficacy of drug treatment 
in humans. It was obvious from Table 2 that 100 % of Sal-
monella  spp.  isolated  from  poultry  meat  were  resistant 
to each of erythromycin and tetracycline, 9 (90 %) were 
resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 8 (80 %) showing 
resistance  to  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,  7  (70  %) 
exhibiting resistance to each of streptomycin, ampicillin-
sulbactam, nalidixic acid and gentamycin. Moreover, the 
lower  resistance  rates  to  chloramphenicol  (50  %),  cip-
rofloxacin (30 %) and ceftriaxone (10 %) were observed. 

Nearly similar resistance rate to ampicillin, streptomycin, 
nalidixic acid, tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfameth-
oxazole  was  recorded  in  Salmonella  spp.  isolated  from 
chicken meat in Pakistan [15]. On the contrary, the lower 
resistance rate to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin corrobo-
rates with others in India [11].

streptomycin, 

chloramphenicol, 

Table  2  also  showed  that  all  Salmonella  isolates  of 
human  origin  were  resistant  to  ampicillin,  erythromy-
cin,  streptomycin,  tetracycline,  ampicillin-sulbactam, 
trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, nali-
dixic  acid  and  amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid.  Conversely, 
the resistance to ceftriaxone and gentamycin was found 
in 50 % of the isolates. On the other hand, none of the 
isolates  was  resistant  to  ciprofloxacin.  Consistent  with 
our results, a higher resistance rate (100 %) to ampicil-
lin, 
trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole  and  tetracyclines  was  recorded  in  S. 
Typhimurium strains isolated from diarrhoeic patients in 
Kenya [16]. Another worrisome situation in this study is 
that, 50 % of Salmonella isolates from diarrhoeic patients 
were  resistant  to  ceftriaxone  and  gentamycin.  This  is 
of  particular  concern  because  the  extended  spectrum 
cephalosporins  such  as  ceftriaxone  are  the  antibiotics 
of choice for treatment of invasive salmonellosis in chil-
dren and the emergence of resistance toward these drugs 
could be attributed to inappropriate use of them in treat-
ment  of  Salmonella  infections  in  humans.  The  higher 
susceptibility  of  S.  Typhimurium  isolated  from  human 
source to ciprofloxacin (100 %) in this study may be due 
to  discriminate  use  of  this  drug  because  it  is  relatively 
expensive, not easily affordable to all people, not sold in 
private pharmacies without prescription. This result cor-
roborates  the  findings  of  other  investigators  in  Kenya

[16]. Therefore, ciprofloxacin still to have a high potency 
against  NTS  strains  in  humans  and  continue  to  be  the 
most successful drug used for treatment of septicaemic 
salmonellosis in adult humans. The increased resistance 
of S. Typhimurium isolated from humans to quinolones 
(nalidixic acid) in this study (100 %) is a matter of con-
cern  and  could  be  attributed  to  indiscriminate  use  of 
these antibiotics by human patients. Moreover, the pres-
ence of these drug residues in food of animal origin may 
results in increased resistance among human’s isolates.

Table 3 verified that all Salmonella spp. isolated from 
poultry and humans were MDR, exhibiting resistance to 
at least four or more antibiotics displayed by ten resist-
ance patterns.

Molecular detection of Salmonella virulence genes 
(virulotyping)
Table 3 revealed the presence of pefA gene among three 
Salmonella strains isolated from poultry meat, belonged 
to  S.  Rubislaw,  S.  Typhimurium  and  untypable  strain 
(one isolate, each) (Fig. 1). Moreover, hilA gene was only 
identified in one isolate of S. Kiel (Fig. 2). Furthermore, 
three Salmonella isolates from poultry meat comprising 
untypable strains (two isolates) and S. Typhimurium (one 

isolate) were harboring sopB gene (Fig. 3). The detection 
of pefA gene in S. Rubislaw in Gambia and Senegal [14] 
and S. Typhimurium in India [4] was previously reported. 
On  the  other  hand,  hilA  gene  was  identified  in  Salmo-
nella serotypes isolated from chickens in Iran [17].

It  was  obvious  from  Table  3  that  all  S.  Typhimurium 
isolates from humans were harboring sopB compared to 
one isolate had stn gene (Figs. 3, 4). Consistent with our 
findings, sopB gene was previously identified in S. Typh-
imurium  isolated  from  diarrhoeic  patients  and  birds  in 
India [18]. Meanwhile, stn gene was detected in S. Typh-
imurium isolated from humans in India [4].

Molecular detection and sequencing of class 1 integrons
A  notable  feature  in  this  study  is  that  all  Salmonella 
strains  isolated  from  poultry  meat  and  humans  were 
MDR  and  harboring  class  I  integrons  that  are  chromo-
somally located (Fig. 5). Ten different profiles of class I 
integrons with variable amplicon sizes ranged from 650–
3000 bp were observed (Table 3). Similarily, class I inte-
grons were detected in 97 % of S. Typhimurium isolated 
from  Norwegian  diarrhoeic  patients  [19].  On  the  con-
trary, a lower detection rate (9 %) was recorded in Sal-
monella spp. isolated from poultry meat [20]. Sequencing

of the variable amplicons of class I integrons denoted by 
asterisks (Fig. 5) revealed the presence of gene cassettes 
containing  aminoglycoside  acetyltransferase  [aac(3)-Id 
or aacCA5] gene which confers resistance against genta-
mycin, aminoglycoside adenyltransferase (aadA2, aadA4, 
aadA7)  genes  that  confer  resistance  to  streptomycin 
and spectinomycin, streptothricin acetyltransferase (sat) 
encoding  resistance  against  streptothricin,  dihydro-
folate reductase type 15 (dfrA15) that confers resistance 
to trimethoprim, lnuF gene that codes for lincosamides 
resistance  (lincomycin  and  clindamycin)  and  putative 

esterase  (estX).  Interestingly,  the  aac  (3)-Id  plus  aadA7 
were  the  most  predominant  resistance  genes  identified 
in  class  I  integron  gene  cassettes  of  1600  bp  (S.  Derby, 
duck), 1500 bp (untypable strain, duck) and 1550 bp (S. 
Typhimurium,  chicken).  The  same  cassettes  harbor-
ing aac (3)-Id and aadA7 genes were previously identi-
fied  in  class  I  integron  of  S.  Haifa  (GenBank  accession 
no. AY563051) [21], S. Newport (AY458224) [22] and S. 
Kentucky (AY463797) [23]. Despite the presence of these

sensitive to streptomycin and this could be attributed to 
point  mutations  in  the  aac(3)-Id  gene  of  S.  Derby  [24] 
and  frame  shift  mutation  in  S.  Typhimurium  [25,  26]. 
Nucleotide  sequence  analysis  revealed  point  mutations 
in  the  aac(3)-Id  gene  of  S.  Derby  leading  to  the  amino 
acid  changes  at  codon  36  (glutamine  CAG→proline 
CCG), codon 166,172 (arginine AGA→threonine ACA), 
codon  187  (arginine  CGA→CTA  leucine)  and  codon 
189  (cysteine  TGC→arginine  CGC).C-to-T  transition 
at  position  208  of  the  deduced  polypeptide  resulted 
in  a  leucine  to  phenylalanine  substitution  and  A  to  C 

transversion at codon 214 resulted in asparagine to his-
tidine substitution. Silent mutation was recorded only at 
nucleotide 138 and didn’t result in amino acid substitu-
tion (CCA→CCG, both are proline). Moreover, sequence 
analysis of aadA7 gene showed frame shift mutation due 
to  additional  cytosine  at  position  969  of  the  deposited 
sequence of S. Typhimurium from chicken.

In  the  present  study,  only  one  isolate  of  S.  Typhimu-
rium from human was found to harbor class I integrons 
of  650,  750  and  1600  bp.  Sequence  analysis  of  650  bp 
revealed the presence of gene cassette containing aadA4

which  showed  100  %  identity  with  aadA4  previously 
identified in class I integron of S. Newport (CP006631) 
and plasmid of S. Indiana (ref|NG_041636). In addition, 
the  1600  bp  integron  carried  gene  cassette  containing 
dfrA15 gene that showed 100 % amino acid and nucleo-
tide homology with dfrA15 gene previously reported in S. 
enterica strain (KM823524).

The  sat  gene  detected  in  the  gene  cassette  of  class 
I  integron  (650  bp)  of  S.  Typhimurium  in  this  study 
was  previously  identified  in  S.  Kedougou  (DQ284538) 
[27]  and  plasmid  of  S.  Choleraesuis  (AY509004)  [28]. 
Moreover,  the  1500  bp  amplicon  identified  in  S.  Typh-
imurium  contained  estX-sat  gene  cassette  that 
is 
identical  to  estX  gene  previously  identified  in  S.  Typh-
imurium (EF051039), sat gene of S. Choleraesuis plasmid 
(ref|NG_036624)  and  SC-B67  strain  (AY509004).  Point 
mutations were observed in estX-sat gene cassette in this 
study compared to the classical estX and sat genes (99 % 
nucleotide  identity);  these  genes  displayed  both  mis-
sense and silent mutations. The nucleotide number 763 
of estX was exchanged from T to C resulting in exchange 
of amino acid (phenylalanine) into leucine. Furthermore, 
at  codon  288  (histidine  TAC→tyrosine  CAC)  and  290 
(threonine ACA→alanine GCA). Silent mutations were 
recorded at nucleotides 894 (GTC→GTA, alanine), 903 
(TAT→TAC,  tyrosine)  and  927  (GTC→GTA,  both  are 
valine). While in sat gene, silent mutations were detected 
at codon 418 (ACT→ACC, tyrosine), 428 (GTC→GTA, 
valine),  451  and  453  (GGC→GGT,  GGA→GGG  both 
are  glycine).  Amino  acids  replacement  was  recorded 
in  sat  gene  at  codon  459  (lysine  AAA→glutamic  acid 

GAA),  462  (proline  CCG→leucine  CTG)  and  465  (iso-
leucine  ATC→threonine  ACC).  Nonsense  mutation 
was  predicted  at  nucleotide  1418  (serine  TCA→stop 
codon TAA). Antimicrobial drug resistance can occur by 
point mutations in the bacterial genome [29] or through 
mobile genetic elements called integrons which are able 
to  disseminate  the  antimicrobial  resistance  among  the 
enterobacteriaceae by horizontal transfer [30].

In fact, this study reports for the first time the presence 
of aadA2 plus lnuF genes within the same integron gene 
cassette of 1900 bp in S.typhimurium from chicken. The 
nucleotide  sequence  of  aadA2  and  lnuF  genes,  respec-
tively showed 99 and 100 % identity with aadA2 and lnuF 
genes  previously  reported  in  S.  enterica  serovar  Stanley 
(EU118119). Moreover, the aadA2 gene had 99 % amino 
acid  and  nucleotide  homology  with  aadA2  previously 
identified in S. Typhimurium isolated from food-animals 
and humans in Mexico (FJ460233) [31]. On the other hand, 
the 1900 bp of class I integron was found to harbor aadA2 
plus dfrA12 in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium isolated 
from food-animals, chicken and humans in Malaysia [32].
The  nucleotide  sequence  of  aadA2  showed  four 
base  differences 
in  GenBank 
reported  cassettes  and  this  caused  point  mutation 
which  are  responsible  for  an  alteration  in  the  codon 
60  (glycine  GGA→arginine  CGA),  codon  61(isoleu-
cine  ATC→threonine  ACC),  codon  62  (asparagine 
AAC→aspartic  acid  GAC)  and  codon  105  (proline 
CCT→TCT  serine)  (Fig.  6).  Similarly,  point  mutation 
in the aadA2 gene of NTS enterica isolates was reported 
[29].

Conclusions
The higher resistance rates displayed by Salmonella iso-
lates in this study to the antibiotics and the detection of 
class 1 integron gene cassettes harboring resistance genes 
among MDR strains shows the potential of integrons to 
carry and spread resistance genes to other S. enterica iso-
lates or to other bacteria. Therefore, a more prudent use 
of antibiotics in both humans and animals is required.

Methods
Ethical approval
This  study  was  approved  by  Zagazig  University,  Egypt 
ethical board (Protocol No. 10122). Permission to collect 
stool  samples  was  obtained  from  the  administrators  of 
Al-Ahrar General hospital.

Specimen collection
The present work was conducted during the period from 
March, 2014 to February, 2015. A total of one hundred 
fresh  poultry  carcasses  comprising  broiler  chicken  and 
ducks  (50,  each)  were  randomly  purchased  from  poul-
try retail outlets at Zagazig City, Egypt. In addition, fifty 
stool samples were collected from the patients attending 
the outpatients’ clinic of Al-Ahrar General Hospital. The 
inclusion criteria were restricted to the patients who suf-
fered  from  diarrhoea,  fever  and  gave  informed  written 
consent  to  participate  in  the  study.  Moreover,  patients 
received antibiotic treatments were excluded. A swab was 
obtained from each freshly passed stool sample, labeled, 
ice packed and transported to the Bacteriology Labora-
tory, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Zagazig University, 
Egypt within 24 h for bacteriological analysis.

Isolation and identification of Salmonella spp
Salmonella  isolation  was  carried  out  according  to  the 
standard  methods  recommended  by  ISO  6579  [33]. 
Twenty-five  grams  of  poultry  meat  were  excised  from 
each  sample  and  minced  with  225  ml  of  buffered  pep-
tone  water  (BPW)  enrichment  broth.  Also,  each  stool 
swab was inserted in sterile tube containing 9 ml BPW. 
All  samples  were  incubated  at  37  °C  for  24  h.  Aliquots 
(0.1 ml) of the pre-enriched culture was inoculated into 
10  ml  of  Rappaport  Vasiliadis  (RV)  enrichment  broth 
and incubated at 42 °C for 24 h. A loopful of the enriched 
culture  was  streaked  on  Xylose-Lysine-Deoxycholate 
(XLD)  agar  plates  (Oxoid,  Basingstoke,  UK)  and  incu-
bated at 37 °C for 24 h. Suspected colonies with typical 
Salmonella  morphology  were  confirmed  biochemically 
by  indole,  citrate  utilization,  urease,  triple  sugar  iron 
(TSI) and lysine iron agar (LIA) tests. All biochemically 
confirmed Salmonella isolates were serologically identi-
fied on the basis of somatic (O) and flagellar (H) antigens 
by slide agglutination using commercial antisera (SISIN, 

Berlin)  following  Kauffman-White  scheme  [34]  in  col-
laboration with Serology Unit, Animal Health Research 
Institute, Dokki, Egypt.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (antibiogram)
Susceptibility  of  Salmonella  isolates  to  various  routine 
antimicrobial drugs was tested by the standard disc dif-
fusion  technique  [35]  using  Mueller–Hinton  agar  and 
commercial antibiotic discs (Oxoid, UK). The antibiotics 
used were ampicillin (10 μg), erythromycin (15 μg), strep-
tomycin (10 μg), ciprofloxacin (5 μg), tetracycline (30 μg), 
ceftriaxone  (30  μg),  ampicillin-sulbactam  (20  μg),  tri-
methoprim-sulfamethoxazole  (25  μg),  chloramphenicol 
(30 μg), nalidixic acid (30 μg), gentamicin (10 μg), amoxi-
cillin-clavulanic acid (30 μg). The inhibition zones in mm 
were measured and scored as sensitive, intermediate and 
resistant categories in accordance with the critical break-
points  recommended  by  the  Clinical  and  Laboratory 
Standards Institute [36].

Molecular detection of Salmonella virulence genes using 
uniplex PCR
A  total  of  twelve  Salmonella  isolates  were  screened  for 
the presence of virulence genes using PCR. These genes 
including; plasmid encoded fimbriae (pefA), hyper inva-
sive  locus  (hilA),  Salmonella  outer  protein  (sopB)  and 
Salmonella  enterotoxin  gene  (stn).  Briefly,  DNA  was 
extracted  from  the  overnight  bacterial  culture  using 
ABIO pure Genomic DNA extraction kit with modifica-
tions  from  the  manufacturer’s  recommendation.  DNA 
amplification was carried out using specific primers sup-
plied from Metabion, Germany (Table 4). Primers were 
utilized in a 25 µl reaction containing 12.5 µl of Emerald 
Amp  Max  PCR  Master  Mix  (Takara,  Japan),  one  µl  of 
each primer (20 pmol concentration), 4.5 µl of nuclease 
free water, and 6 µl of DNA template. The reaction was 
performed in a T3 Biometra thermal cycler. Positive and 
negative controls were included in each reaction. Aliquot 
of each amplicon along with a 100 bp molecular weight 
DNA  ladder  (Fermentas,  USA)  were  separated  by  elec-
trophoresis on 1.5 % agarose gel (Applichem, Germany, 
GmbH) stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide (Sigma, 
USA) in 1 × TBE buffer on a mini slab horizontal electro-
phoresis unit (Bio-Rad, USA) at 100 V for 30 min. The gel 
was photographed by a gel documentation system (Alpha 
Innotech, Biometra) and the data was analyzed through 
computer software.

Molecular detection and sequencing of class 1 integrons
All  MDR  Salmonella  isolates  (n  =  12)  were  tested  for 
class Ι integrons using specific primers with the follow-
the presence of conserved regions (5′-CS and 3′-CS) of 

ing sequences: 5′ CS-GGC ATC CAA GCA GCA AG and

DNA extraction, amplification and gel analysis were per-
formed as mentioned before except to amplify the DNA 
in the thermal cycler we used a three-step profile (cycling 
conditions):  1  min  of  denaturation  at  94  °C,  1  min  of 
annealing at 55 °C, and 5 min of extension at 72 °C for a 
total of 35 cycles. Five seconds were added to the exten-
sion time at each cycle. Amplified products with variable 
sizes were purified using QIA quick PCR Product extrac-
tion kit (Qiagen, Valencia). Each purified amplicon was 
sequenced in both forward and reverse directions using 
the amplification primers. DNA sequences were obtained 
by Applied Biosystems 3130 genetic analyzer (HITACHI, 
Japan).Nucleotide sequence analysis was compared with 
published GenBank DNA sequences using NCBI BLAST 
program 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/)  and 
alignment was performed usingMEGA6 program.
