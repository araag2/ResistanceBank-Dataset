ABSTRACT.  The  Staphylococcus  aureus  is  the  most  common 
isolated  microorganism  in  ruminant  animal  species  diagnostic  with 
clinical  or  subclinical  mastitis.  Dairy  herds  with  these  diseases 
can  transfer  S.  aureus  into  the  milk  supply,  which  can  lead  to  food 
poisoning in humans. The objective of this study was to evaluate the 
profile of antimicrobial susceptibility, the presence of femA gene, the 
genetic relationships among isolates of S. aureus obtained from milk

originating  from  flocks  diagnosed  with  subclinical  mastitis  in  nine 
rural properties in the northern of Minas Gerais State. To this end, 498 
samples of bovine milk tested positive for the California mastitis test 
(CMT)  were  subjected  to  morphological  methods  and  biochemical 
patterns  for  microbiological  presumptive  identification  of  S.  aureus. 
The PCR test with the genetic marker femA was used to confirm the 
species  S.  aureus. All  the  26  isolates  presumptively  identified  as  S. 
aureus amplified a fragment of 132 bp corresponding to the femA gene. 
The profile of antimicrobial susceptibility was performed according to 
the disk-diffusion methodology and two isolates were susceptible to all 
the antibiotics tested. The drug multiresistence was found in 80.76% 
of the isolates. The determination of the genetic profile and the clonal 
relationship among the isolates was performed by the method of DNA 
RAPD-PCR polymorphism. The S. aureus isolates were divided into 
two  groups  with  26  distinct  subgroups. The  analysis  of  RAPD-PCR 
showed  no  genetic  diversity  among  them,  heterogeneous  profile  and 
absence of clonality.

INTRODUCTION

The bovine mastitis is one of the most common diseases occurring in dairy cattle and 
its main feature is the inflammation of the mammary glands (Viguier et al., 2009; Song et al., 
2016). The disease occurs in two ways: clinical and subclinical mastitis. The clinical one has 
evident characteristics in its expression, but the subclinical mastitis requires complementary 
examinations, such as the California mastitis test (CMT) and somatic cell counts in milk (SCC) 
(Pantoja et al., 2009; Silva and Nogueira, 2010; Rall et al., 2014). The subclinical mastitis has 
special importance as it goes unnoticed and affects in a great extent the production’s animal 
(Bhati et al., 2016). As a result of bovine mastitis, there are low production levels, poor quality 
and/or discard of milk that generate economic losses in the dairy cattle industry (Viguier et al., 
2009; Song et al., 2016).

A  wide  variety  of  microbial  agents  may  be  involved  with  the  etiology  of  bovine 
mastitis, however, Staphylococcus aureus is the most prevalent in intramammary infections 
being related to more than 80% of the cases (Pellegrino et al., 2011; Song et al., 2016). Although 
fungi and algae have been observed in cow milk diagnosed with clinical mastitis, 90% of 
isolates are represented by bacteria, including those belonging to the genera Staphylococcus, 
Streptococcus and coliforms (Ganda et al., 2016).

Prevention and treatment programs to mastitis include the use of antimicrobials in 
dairy cattle flocks in an attempt to eliminate the disease (Pellegrino et al., 2011; Silva et al., 
2012; Teixeira et al., 2014). However, the indiscriminate use of antibiotics, which can lead to 
drug multiresistance and the risk of the presence of its residues in the milk, has turned mastitis 
an important disease to public health (Ganda et al., 2016). The correct identification of the 
mastitis pathogen is an important factor for the treatment and prophylaxis of this infection. 
DNA-based  molecular  typing  methods  are  more  efficient  and  have  high  sensitivity  and 

A.R.E.O. Xavier et al.Genetics and Molecular Research 16 (2): gmr160297093

specificity for the identification of microorganisms (Tel and Bozkaya, 2012; Rahman et al., 
2016). The identification of S. aureus at the species level can be performed by PCR through 
detection of the femA (factor essential for methicillin resistance) gene. This gene codes for a 
protein of 48-50 kDa, which is recognized as a specific factor and chromosomally coded in 
this pathogen, being involved in the structure of the bacterial cell wall (Rodrigues da Silva and 
Silva, 2005; Teixeira et al., 2014). S. aureus is well known for having resistance to antimicrobial 
agents, which may lead to complications for the treatment of their infections besides increasing 
the treatment costs. One of these resistances is coded by the mecA (methicilin resistance) 
gene,  which  confers  resistance  to  all  beta-lactamases  including  methicillin,  oxacillin  and 
cephalosporins (Nemeghaire et al., 2014).

Several molecular typing methods have been used in order to investigate the bovine 
mastitis epidemiology at the level of subspecies. They include methods of comparative typing 
based on standard electrophoretic bands, typing methods of libraries and genome sequencing. 
Among the typing methods based on fingerprint, PCR-RFLP, RAPD-PCR, ERIC-PCR, BOX-
PCR,  and  REP-PCR  have  been  described  as  simple  and  quick  techniques  for  taxonomic 
and  epidemiological  analyses  of  several  species  of  the  genus  Staphylococcus  (Bergonier 
et al., 2014; Idil and Bilkay, 2014; Rahman et al., 2016; Ławniczek-Wałczyk et al., 2017). 
Epidemiological molecular studies have contributed significantly to the understanding of the 
sources, routes of transmission and prognosis for many pathogens that cause bovine mastitis, 
as well as to understand the mechanisms of adaptation to the host and the causes of the disease 
(Supré et al., 2011; McMillan et al., 2016).

The objective of this study was to recognize the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of 
S. aureus obtained from bovine milk with subclinical mastitis, as well as to characterize the 
molecular and epidemiological profile of the isolates.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Bacterial isolates and profile of antimicrobial sensitivity

Nine properties of rural producers in the municipalities of Janaúba (AG e NP), Icaraí 
de Minas (CC, GU and VA), Porteirinha (MU), Matias Cardoso (MC), Bocaiúva (TR), and 
São João da Lagoa (SL) in northern of Minas Gerais State were chosen, whose geographical 
location is shown in Figure 1.

The milk collection in these properties was performed from January to April 2016. In 
each animal, before milking, CMT for the diagnosis of subclinical mastitis was perfomed. The 
CMT test was performed in all the lactating dairy cows and from the 15th day postpartum, 
a commercial product was used, specific to the test, and each teat was classified as: negative 
(-),  mild  reaction  (+),  moderate  (++),  and  severe  (+++),  in  accordance  with  the  intensity 
of the gel. The positive milk samples for CMT were selected and sent to the Laboratory of 
Animal Health from the Institute of Agricultural Sciences of the Federal University of Minas 
Gerais for microbiological analysis. The genus-level identification of isolates was obtained by 
microbiological standard analyses, including biochemical and enzymatic tests complying with 
the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) standardized in the Microbiology Laboratory 
(Gram  staining,  catalase  test,  coagulase  test,  and  the  DNAse  test).  The  susceptibility  to 
several classes of antibiotics was determined by the disk diffusion method according to CLSI 
(Wayne, 2016) using the following antimicrobials (Laborclin): 10 μg gentamicin (GEN), 300

G  (PEN),  30  μg  cefoxitin  (CFO),  1  μg  oxacillin  (OXA),  5  μg  ciprofloxacin  (CIP),  10  μg 
ampicillin (AMP), and 30 μg cephalothin (CFL). A standard strain of S. aureus ATCC 25923 
was used as a positive control. The S. aureus isolates were stored at -20°C in the BHI medium 
(Prodimol Biotechnology) containing 20% glycerol.

DNA extraction and PCR analysis for the detection of the femA gene

The cryopreserved isolates of S. aureus were reactivated by sowing in the BHI medium 
(Prodimol Biotechnology) and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The grown bacterial cultures were 
sent to the Laboratory of Biotechnology of Federal University of Minas Gerais, where they 
were subjected to DNA extraction using the digestion method by K- proteinase followed by 
phenol-chloroform (Barea et al., 2004) with some modifications. A volume of 1.5 mL of each 
culture of S. aureus was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant was discarded and 
the bacterial cell pellet ressuspended in 400 μL buffer of digestion (0.9% NaCl, 0.2 M EDTA 
and 20 mg/mL proteinase K). It was added 40 μL SDS at 20% and the samples incubated in 
a water bath at 60°C for 10 min and then cooled at room temperature. The DNA precipitation 

A.R.E.O. Xavier et al.Genetics and Molecular Research 16 (2): gmr160297095

was performed with 1 V of phenol and 1 V of isoamyl alcohol: chloroform (1:24), followed by 
centrifugation, for 5 min, at 10,000 rpm. The aqueous phase was transferred to new tube, where 
2V of 100% ice-cold ethanol and 0.1 M NaCl were added. The samples were incubated for 
10 min on ice and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded 
and the sedimented DNA after drying process was resuspended in preserving buffer (10 mM, 
pH 8.0 TRIS, 5 mM EDTA) and stored at -20ºC. The integrity and quantification of extracted 
DNAs were checked by agarose gel electrophoresis at 1.0%. This material was used in the 
PCR and RAPD-PCR performed in the Bioprospecting and Genetic Resources Laboratory in 
the State University of Montes Claros. All the primers used in this study were synthesized by 
Integrated DNA Technology, USA.

Genus-level  identification  of  S.  aureus  strains  was  performed  by  tracking 
the  presence  of  the  femA  through  PCR  technique.  The  pair  of  primers  FemA1-
5'AAAAAAGCACATAACAAGCG3' and FemA2-5'GATAAAGAAGAACCAGCAG3' were 
used and the PCR conditions according to Teixeira et al. (2014). The reactions were carried out 
in a mix containing 1X Taq buffer from the Kappa kit PCR, MgCl2 (2.5 mM), deoxynucleotides 
(1 μM), Taq Polymerase Kappa (0.5 U), 1.25 μM of each primer, and 50 ng bacterial DNA in 
a final total reaction volume of 25 μL. The 132-base pair expected amplicons were visualized 
on 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and photographed and documented.

RAPD-PCR and statistical analysis

The characterization of the genetic profile and the clonal relationship among the S. aureus 
isolates were performed using the RAPD-PCR technique. For the RAPD-PCR, oligonucleotide 
S232 was used and the PCR conditions described in the literature for the polymorphism analysis 
intra- and interspecies of S. aureus (Idil and Bilkay, 2014). The reactions were carried out in a 
mix containing 1X Taq buffer from the Kappa kit PCR, MgCl2 (2.5 mM), deoxy nucleotides 
(1 μM), Taq Polymerase Kappa (0.5 U), 1 μM of each primer and 250 ng of bacterial DNA 
in a final total reaction volume of 25 μL. The amplicons were visualized on 1.5% agarose gel 
stained with ethidium bromide and photographed and documented. The analysis of the profiles 
of DNAs amplification obtained through RAPD-PCR was performed by visual inspection of two 
observers and transformed into binary data in a matrix, according to the presence (1) or absence 
(0) of bands. To assess the genetic relationship among the isolates the matrix was subjected to 
grouping analysis by the nearest neighbor method (UPGMA or unweight pair-group method 
with arithmetic mean) based on the Pearson correlation coefficient for automatic generation of 
the dendrogram using the statistical program 2008 Statistical Package (MVSP) version 3.12h 
(GeoMem, Barrow in Furness, United Kindgom).

Ethical aspects

This study was performed following ethical standards approved by the Ethics and 
Animal  Experimentation  Committe  from  the  Federal  University  of  Minas  Gerais,  under 
Protocol No. 145/2013.

Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of S. aureusGenetics and Molecular Research 16 (2): gmr16029709originating from 9 different rural properties in northern Minas Gerais were initially identified 
as S. aureus by standard morphological and biochemical methods. The isolate identification 
was confirmed through the femA gene PCR of S. aureus. All the S. aureus (N = 26) exhibited a 
132-base pair amplicon specific species (Figure 2) corresponding to the genetic marker femA.

fragment of 132-base pairs of the corresponding femA gene is indicated on the right in the gel.

This marker has been described in the literature as a signature sequence for genotyping 
of S. aureus isolates (Rodrigues da Silva and Silva, 2005; Teixeira et al., 2014; Oliveira et al., 
2016), which corroborates the results of the genus and species of microorganisms identified in 
this study as S. aureus.

The  antimicrobial  susceptibility  test  showed  that  S.  aureus  isolated  from  cases  of 
bovine subclinical mastitis in Northern rural properties from Minas Gerais exhibited varying 
degrees of antimicrobial resistance (Table 1).

They  were  resistant  to  amikacin  (2.60%),  amoxicillin  (76.03%),  ampicillin  (80.76%), 
cephalothin (2.60%), cefoxitin (15.38%), penicillin (92.30%), and oxacillin (2.6%). The isolates 
NP4 and TR5 showed sensitivity to all antibiotics to which they were tested, however, the drug 
multiresistance was found in 80.76% (21/26) of the isolates (Table 1). Similar results regarding the 
percentage of S. aureus isolates multiresistant to drugs were found in a study by Silva et al. (2012).
S.  aureus  isolated  from  animals  with  clinical  and  subclinical  mastitis  exhibit  high 
rates of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics (Kalmus et al., 2011; El Behiry et al., 2012; Silva 
et al., 2012; Jagielski et al., 2014; Schmidt et al., 2015). A considerable rate of simultaneous 
resistance  to  beta-lactamases  amoxicillin,  ampicillin  and  penicillin  was  found  in  69.03% 
(18/26) of S. aureus isolates in this study (Table 1). Silva et al. (2012) analyzing the sensitivity 
profile in vitro of S. aureus isolates of bovine subclinical mastitis found a simultaneous rate of 
resistance to penicillin and ampicillin of 66%. These authors suggested that the same resistance 
mechanism is responsible for the inactivation of the tested drugs.

Animals  chronically  infected  are  reservoires  of  penicillin  resistant  S.  aureus  and 
disseminate this phenotype. This dissemination associated with low rate of microbiological 
cure of mastitis caused by this microorganism allows animals chronically infected remain in 
the flock and spread resistant strains to other animals (Taponen et al., 2003; Barkema et al., 
2006; Silva et al., 2012).

The  sensitivity  determination  to  in  vitro  antimicrobial  agents  may  not  reflect  the 
real pathogen profile when in real contact with the drug (Silva et al., 2012). However, the 
determination of the S. aureus susceptibility profile from bovine mastitis before antibiotics 
can be helpful in choosing the most adequate drug for the treatment of the disease. In addition, 
the recognition of effective mechanisms for the disease control could be established (Wang et 
al., 2016).

In  farms,  pathogenic  strains  of  microorganisms  may  originate  from  a  variety  of 
sources, including the animal itself. These strains can easily pass from one source to another 
through  different  routes  of  transmission,  which  include:  contact  between  animals,  stalls, 
milking equipment, and the milkers’ hands (McMillan et al., 2016). Genotypic methods may 
be  employed  to  obtain  information  regarding  the  potential  infection  sources  and  routes  of 
diseases transmission. The random amplification of polymorphic DNA analysis (RAPD) is 
a technique that allows to analyze the genetic diversity among S. aureus isolates (Idil and 
Bilkay, 2014; Rahman et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016). In this study, the genotypic analysis 
of 26 isolates carrying the femA gene employing the RAPD technique produced 16 distinct 
fragments (Figure 3).

For band-sharing analysis, the bands in a range between 250 to 3000 base pairs were 
considered. The binary matrix made by visual observation on the presence or absence of these 
bands further submitted to the UPGMA analysis based on Pearson’s coefficient generated a 
dendrogram of genetic relationships among S. aureus isolates (Figure 4).

These  isolates  were  grouped  into  two  different  groups  of  which  84.61%  (22/26) 
profile of group I and 15.39% (04/26) of Group II. Still according to the Pearson’s correlation 
coefficient, it was possible to determine 26 different genotypes (IA to IU and IIA to IID), 
which showed a substantial variation of S. aureus genotypes not only among isolates from 
different rural properties, but also from those isolated in the same flock. (Figure 4 and Table 
1). Wang et al. (2016), when analyzing RAPD polymorphism of S. aureus isolates recovered 
from cows with mastitis in China, obtained similar results to this study.

No clonality was verified among the 26 S. aureus isolates carrying the femA gene. 
Profiles with Pearson’s coefficient of 0.87 were found among strains of S. aureus isolated 
from flocks of the same rural property [clone IM (isolate TR4) and clone IL (isolate TR6)], 
as well as from rural properties, but located in the same municipality [clone IA (isolate CC1) 
and clone IB (isolate GU1)] (Figure 4 and Table 1). The bands sharing analysis among these 
isolates revealed the presence or absence of 1 or 3 bands in disagreement, which leads the 
authors to hypothesize possible mutation among the isolates. Carvalho et al. (2016) analyzing 
the  genetic  profile  of  nosocomial  isolates  of  Acinetobacter  baumannni  through  DNA 
polymorphism analysis by ERIC-PCR also suggested the same hypothesis for isolates with 
high genetic similarity.

Two isolates originated from different rural proprieties and municipalities (Janaúba 
and Bocaiuva) sensitive to all the tested antibiotics [NP4 (clone (I-V) and TR5 (clone I-K)] 
showed  low  similarity  among  themselves,  with  Pearson’s  coefficient  of  0.35  (Figure  4 
and Table 1). However, the comparison of the genetic relationship (Pearson’s coefficient 
equal to 0.75) between the isolate TR5 sensitive to the tested antibiotics (clone I-K) and 
the multi-resistant TR-7 isolate (clone I-J) originated from the same rural property revealed 
the absence of correlation between the phenotypic susceptibility profile to antibiotics and 
the characterization of the genetic profile through RAPD-based polymorphism analysis for 
these isolates.

Idil and Biklay (2014) evaluated the use of the RAPD-PCR technique for clonality 
determination  among  nosocomial  S.  aureus  isolates  resistant  to  methicillin. According  to 
their  findings  the  combination  of  more  than  a  RAPD  primer  can  provide  a  greater  power 
of discrimination among isolates of this species. In this study, we used the oligonucleotide 
S232 designed by Idil and Biklay (2014). Despite of the different origin and non-resistance to 
methicillin, the band profile obtained with the RAPD-PCR was similar to those authors. The 
combination of one or more RAPD primers could produce results with different similarity 
profiles. Nevertheless, it was possible to evidence it as a useful tool for future epidemiological 
studies using a higher number of samples to be isolated in herds in the studied region. It is 
possible to conclude that the femA species-specific for S. aureus was efficient for genotypic 
confirmation  of  isolates  identified  by  standard  microbiological  analyses  in  this  study. The 
antimicrobial  susceptibility  test  displayed  varying  resistance  degrees  among  the  isolates. 
Nonetheless, it was considerable the simulateneous resistance rate to beta-lactams. There was 
a wide variation in the genotypes of S. aureus isolates, not only among those isolated from 
different rural properties, but also in the same flock. This wide genomic variation added to 
resistance to antimicrobials herein tested is a reason for concern about animal public health in 
the Minas Gerais regions where the microorganisms were isolated. The knowledge on the S. 
aureus genetic diversity and the antimicrobial resistance profile of dairy breeds may be useful 
as a tool for decision making in the implementation of control measures and prevention of 
clinical mastitis and or subclinical in milking environments.
