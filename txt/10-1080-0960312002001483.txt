Use of norfloxacin in poultry production in the
eastern province of Saudi Arabia and its
possible impact on public health

Samples  of  market-ready  chicken  muscle  and  liver  from  32  local  broiler  farms  were  first  screened  for
antibiotic  residues  by  microbiological  assay. The  antibiotic-residue-positive muscles  and  livers  from  22
farms were further analysed for norfloxacin (NFX) residues by high performance liquid chromatography.
NFX was detected in 35.0% and 56.7% of raw antibiotic-residue-positive muscles and livers, respectively.
The NFX-positive muscles and livers were respectively obtained from 11 (50.0%) and 14 (63.6%) of the
22 antibiotic-residue-positive farms. Since the maximum residue limit (MRL) for NFX has not yet been
fixed, the MRL for enrofloxacin was used in the study. All NFX-positive farms had mean raw tissue levels,
which  were  2.7-  to  34.3-fold  higher  than  the  MRL.  Although  cooking  markedly  reduced  NFX  tissue
concentrations, mean detectable levels remained above MRL in large proportions of NFX-positive samples
and farms. Susceptibility patterns of Enterobacteriaceae isolates from chicken and human patients to NFX
showed alarmingly high rates of resistance in chicken isolates especially among Escherichia coli (45.9%)
and  Pseudomonas spp. (70.6%)  compared  with  patients’ isolates  (10.5%  and  18.2%,  respectively). The
study reveals  widespread  misuse  of NFX  in  the local  poultry  industry,  which  may pose  a major  risk to
public  health  including  possible  stimulation  of  bacterial  resistance  and  hypersensitivity  reactions  to
fluoroquinolones.  More  prudent  use  of  fluoroquinolones  in  food-producing  animals  is  therefore
recommended. Further, there is a need to establish MRL values for NFX.

Introduction

Norfloxacin  (NFX)  is a  fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent with  high  activity  against  Gram-
negative microorganisms, thus recommended for the treatment of human urinary tract infections
(Childs  1993, Pfau  and Sacks  1993, Pittman et  al. 1993). The  fluoroquinolones are relatively
new  antimicrobial  agents  and  resistance  to  them  remains  largely  low.  However,  there  is  a
worrisome world-wide trend of increased resistance to these agents among bacteria responsible
for both hospital- and community-acquired infections including methicillin-resistant Staphylo-
coccus  aureus,  Klebsiella  pneumoniae,  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa,  Serratia  marcescens,
Escherichia  coli,  Salmonella spp.,  Campylobacter spp.  and  Neisseria  gonorrhoeae (Acar  and

Goldstein  1997,  Hayward  et  al. 1999,  Sidorenko  et  al. 1999).  Cross-resistance  between
fluoroquinolones has also been reported among a wide range of microorganisms including both
Gram-positive cocci  and  Gram-negative  bacilli (Barry  and  Fuchs  1997,  Hoogkamp-Korstanje
1997, Peterson et al. 1998, Tankovic et al. 1999).

The  use  of  antimicrobial  agents  in  food-producing  animals  has  recently  become  a  very
important public health issue. These agents  are widely used  for the prevention and therapy of
infectious disease in farm animals, an important measure when raising animals under intensive
husbandry methods of production (Swan 1969, Mercer 1975, Linton 1977, Johnston 1998). In
addition,  they  are  routinely  used  at  sub-therapeutic  levels  as  animal  feed  additives  for  their
growth-promoting  properties  (Droumev  1983).  These  practices,  however,  carry  many  dis-
advantages  including  the  stimulation  of  microbial  resistance  to  antibiotics  with  the  possible
transfer of resistant pathogens from animals to humans (Holmberg et al. 1984, Trolldenier 1996,
Anon.  1998, Tollefson et al. 1998).  Further, the  presence  of drug residues  in animal products
may pose  a potential health risk to the public (Mercer 1975, Linton 1977, Woodward 1991).
Fluoroquinolones were introduced for veterinary use in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia
in the late 1980s. Norfloxacin, in particular, has been available since 1993 in pure powder form
for addition to poultry feed or drinking water for prophylaxis or treatment of infections due to
Gram-negative microorganisms.

This  study was  aimed at  screening  locally  produced edible chicken  tissues  for the possible
presence of norfloxacin residues at the time of marketing. The drug levels were also determined
and  compared  with  the  permissible  maximum  residue  limits  (MRLs)  of  fluoroquinolones.  In
addition,  the  susceptibility  patterns  of  Enterobacteriaceae  isolated  from  chicken  and  human
patients  to norfloxacin were investigated.

Methods
Specimen  collection
A total of 242 muscle and 714 liver samples were obtained from randomly selected chicken that
were ready for market during 49 inspection visits to 32 broiler farms in the eastern province of
Saudi Arabia over a period of two years starting from January  1996. In addition, rectal swabs
from  randomly  selected  live  healthy  chickens  were  obtained.  Urine  specimens  were  also
collected  from patients  attending  at  King  Fahd  Hospital  of  the  University, A1-Khobar,  Saudi
Arabia, for treatment of urinary tract infections.

Microbiological assay  of antibiotic residues
All  chicken  muscle  and  liver  samples  were  first  screened  for  antibiotic  residues  by
microbiological  assay.  Pieces  of  muscle  and  liver (50–100 mg)  were  transferred  into  wells  in
Mueller Hinton agar plates (Oxoid, Unipath Ltd. UK) previously seeded with a reference strain
of  Staphylococcus  aureus (ATCC  25923),  Escherichia  coli (ATCC  35218),  Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and Bacillus subtillis (B.B.L 6633). The plates were then incubated
at  37°C  for  20 h.  These  tests  were  performed  in  duplicate  for  any  bacterial  strain  and  the
appearance  of  an  inhibition  zone  in  any  sample  was  considered  to  indicate  the  presence  of
antibiotic residues.

Norfloxacin  concentration  analysis
One hundred and twenty muscle and 120 liver samples found positive for antibiotic residues by
microbiological  assay  were  further  subjected  to  analysis  by  high  performance  liquid

chromatography  (HPLC)  for  norfloxacin  residues.  Portions  of  muscle  and  liver  (20 g)  were
cooked in 100 ml of water at 100°C for 20 min. Homogenates  of both raw and cooked tissues
were  prepared  in  2.0 M  sodium  phosphate/sulphite  buffer,  pH  6.1  (1:10,  w:v).  The
concentrations  of  NFX  were  then  determined  in  both  raw  and  cooked  tissue  homogenates  as
well as in the cooking fluid using a previously described HPLC method (Chan et al. 1989). The
HPLC  apparatus  was  LC  Module-1  Plus  (Waters  Associates)  equipped  with  a  Novapak  C18
column  (Waters  Associates),  a  UV/visible  detector  set  at  340 nm  and  a  personal  computer
software (Millennium v. 2.15). The mobile phase consisted of methanol:acetonitrile: 0.4 M citric
acid (3:1:10) and was  run at 1.2 ml min– 1.

Bacterial susceptibility  tests
Specimens  were  directly  inoculated  on  MacConkey  agar,  eosin,  methylene  blue  and  xylose
lysine  desoxycholate  agar  media.  Growth  was  identified  by  standard  laboratory  methods
including  Gram  stain  and  API  20E  and  API  10S  systems  (bioM´erieux  SA,  Marcy  I’Etoile,
France). The susceptibility tests of Enterobacteriaceae isolated from chicken and human patients
to norfloxacin (10 mg) were carried out using a Bauer– Kirby disc diffusion method (Bauer et al.
1966). The antibiotic discs were obtained from Oxoid (Unipath Ltd., Basingstoke, Hampshire,
UK)  and  the  results  were  interpreted  according  to  the  criteria  recommended  by  the  National
Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (1993).

Statistical analysis
The results of NFX residue and susceptibility studies were statistically analysed using Student’s
t-test, with a significance  level of P < 0.05.

Results
Norfloxacin  residues
High  performance  liquid  chromatographic  analysis  of  the  120  antibiotic-residue-positive
samples  of  each  of  muscle  and  liver  revealed  that  norfloxacin  residues  were  present  in  42
(35.0%)  raw  muscle  and  68  (56.7%)  raw  liver.  The  antibiotic-residue-positive  samples  were
obtained from 22 (68.8%) of the investigated 32 broiler farms. Eleven (50.0%) and 14 (63.6%)
of  the  22  antibiotic-residue-positive  farms  tested  positively  for  NFX  in  muscle  and  liver
samples,  respectively.

The  mean  NFX  concentrations  for  farms  ranged  from  0.08  to  1.00 mg  g– 1 with  an  overall
mean concentration ( ± SD) of 0.25  ±  0.28 in raw muscle and from 0.11 to 1.03 mg– 1 (mean  ±
SD  =  0.48  ±  0.31)  in raw  liver (Table 1). These  results  indicate that  the overall mean  NFX
concentration in raw liver was approximately two-fold higher than that in raw muscle. However,
after  cooking,  mean  levels  fell  markedly  in  muscle  to  0.11  ±  0.05 mg  g– 1 and  significantly
(P < 0.01)  in  liver  to  0.16  ±  0.12 mg  g– 1 (Table  1).  Norfloxacin  was  also  detectable  in  the
cooking  fluid  of  seven  (31.8%)  antimicrobial-residue-positive  farms  with  an  overall  mean
concentration  ( ±  SD) of 0.06  ±  0.04 mg g– 1 (Table 1).

Figures 1 and 2 display the mean detectable concentrations of norfloxacin in raw and cooked
muscle and liver for each farm in comparison with the internationally recommended maximum
residue  limit  (MRL)  for  enrofloxacin  (0.03 mg  g– 1 ).  All  farms  with  detectable  levels  of
norfloxacin in both raw muscle  and liver had mean concentrations  that were 2.7- to 34.3-fold

rates of resistance were especially noted among E. coli and Pseudomonas spp. chicken isolates
compared with patients’ isolates.

Discussion

The  presence  of  antibiotic  residues  in  food-producing  animals  has  received  enormous  world-
wide attention from local and international regulatory and public health agencies. This is owing
to the importance of the issue and its possible significant impact on public health. Many reports
indicated that microbial resistance to antibiotics may arise as a result of animal exposure to these
agents and that the resistance may possibly be transferred to human pathogens (Sogaard 1973,
Mercer 1975,  Linton 1977,  Holmberg  et al. 1984, Bebora et  al. 1994, Amara  et al. 1995).  In
addition, human exposure to animal products containing significant levels of antibiotic residues
may  provoke  immunological  responses  in  susceptible  individuals  and  cause  disorders  of
intestinal flora (Linton 1977, Holmberg et al. 1984, Woodward 1991).

In the present study, we examined locally produced chicken muscle and liver for the presence of
norfloxacin (NFX). The results showed that a high proportion of the investigated broiler farms had
detectable  levels  of  NFX in  raw muscle  and  liver at the  time  of  marketing.  Fluoroquinolones
distribute widely into body tissues and are found in high concentrations in the excretory organs
especially the liver and in the bile (Prescott and Baggot 1993). They are lipophilic compounds and
are  partially  metabolized  in  the  liver  to  active  metabolites,  which  contribute  to  the
pharmacological action of the parent drugs and the prolongation of their presence  in the body
(Prescott and Baggot 1993). Long withholding periods of 7 days for oral use of fluoroquinolones
in farm animals have been recommended by the drugs’ manufacturers.

Several  organizations  such  as  the  Food  and Agriculture  Organization (FAO), World  Health
Organization  (WHO),  Veterinary  Medicines  Directorate  (VMD)  of  the  European  Union  and
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the USA have set tolerance or maximum residue limits
(MRLs),  acceptable  daily  intakes  (ADIs)  and  withholding  times  for pharmacologically  active
substances  including  antimicrobial  agents.  Different  MRLs  have  been  fixed  for  different
quinolone compounds  by the VMD  of the European Union (Veterinary Medicines  Directorate
1997). However, no MRL values  have yet been fixed for norfloxacin or its parent compound,
pefloxacin by any international regulatory agency. It is therefore prudent to use the lowest MRL
value  (0.03 mg– 1 )  for  quinolone  compounds,  which  is  that  of  enrofloxacin  as  the  MRL  for
norfloxacin,  an approach adopted in  this  study. The  results  showed  that all raw  NFX-positive
muscle  and  liver  samples  had  levels  exceeding  the  MRL.  Moreover,  the  overall  farm  mean
concentrations of NFX in both raw muscle and liver were 8.3 and 16 times, respectively, higher
than  the  MRL.  These  results  confirm  that  NFX  was  heavily  used  in  the  investigated  poultry
farms. They also suggest that the recommended withholding time of 7 days for fluoroquinolones
was either not strictly applied or may be insufficient for this drug. This, however, merits further
investigation since  NFX is a relatively new drug in veterinary practice.

The effect of cooking on NFX residues was also investigated in the same samples. Although
cooking markedly reduced tissue concentrations of NFX, mean farm levels of the drug remained
above MRL in 36.4% and 100% of NFX-positive farms in muscle and liver, respectively. These
results demonstrate that NFX residues may persist in high concentrations in edible tissues even
after cooking if the initial levels  in raw tissues  were excessively  high. This may have serious
implications for human health including the possible induction of hypersensitivity reactions to
fluoroquinolones  in  susceptible  individuals.  It  is  therefore  important  to  set  MRL  values  for

norfloxacin  and  its  parent  compound,  pefloxacin  in  animal-derived  food  products  by  the
concerned  international agencies.

NFX  is  currently recommended for the treatment of human  urinary tract infections (Childs
1993,  Pfau  and  Sacks  1993,  Pittman  et  al. 1993)  and  bacterial  enteritis (Bennish  et  al. 1992,
Dupont and Ericsson 1993), which are commonly caused by Gram-negative organisms such as
E. coli, Pseudomonas spp., Klebsiella spp. and Shigella spp. Although the rates of resistance of
Enterobacteriaceae  to  NFX in  this study  remained  relatively  low among  human isolates,  they
were excessively  high in chicken isolates especially E. coli, Pseudomonas spp. and Klebsiella
spp. Similarly, high levels of resistance to fluoroquinolones have also been observed among E.
coli strains  isolated  from  septicaemic  and  healthy  chickens  in  Spain  (Blanco  et  al. 1997).
Increasing resistance to enrofloxacin among E. coli isolates, particularly from turkeys, was also
noted in Germany (Trolldenier 1996). This may lead to the emergence of microbial resistance
to  quinolones  in  both  avian  and  human  pathogens.  Indeed,  exposure  to  norfloxacin  has  been
shown  to  induce  resistance  to  other  fluoroquinolones  and  even  to  the  structurally  unrelated
aminoglycosides  in  coagulase-negative  staphylococci  (Deshmukh  et  al. 1997).  Moreover,  the
results  of  a  previous  study  conducted  in  our  institution  on  E.  coli serotypes  suggested  that
chicken  might act as  a possible  source  of pathogenic organisms  in humans (AI-Ghamdi et al.
1999). The present study therefore lends  support to the recent calls  for a more prudent use  of
antibiotics in farm animals  so  as  to stem the rise  in microbial resistance  to antibiotics (Anon.
1999, Fox 1999, Sainsbury 1999). This is particularly important with fluoroquinolones as new,
highly effective antimicrobial agents.

Conclusion

The results of this study indicate that there is widespread misuse of fluoroquinolone agents by
poultry producers in the eastern  province of Saudi Arabia. The study also  stresses  the need to
establish MRL and ADI values for norfloxacin and its parent compound, pefloxacin. In addition,
resistance  to  norfloxacin  in  chicken  Enterobacteriaceae  is  alarmingly  high  with  potentially
significant  consequences  for  the  emergence  of  resistance  in  human  pathogens.  It  is  therefore
important to restrict the use of fluoroquinolones in food-producing animals in order to maintain
their viability as  effective therapeutic agents.
