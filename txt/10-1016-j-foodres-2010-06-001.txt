An investigation was carried out to study the dynamics of Salmonella occurrence in chicken eggs during
production at farm level and subsequently in marketing channels (both whole sale and retail markets) in
north India and to select an effective antimicrobial agent for the control of Salmonella in poultry birds. A total
of 560 chicken eggs comprising 260 from poultry farms and 300 from marketing channels were collected and
screened for the presence of Salmonella during the period of April 2006 to July 2007. Twenty seven (4.82%) of
the samples tested were found to be positive for Salmonella. Among the chicken eggs from poultry farms and
marketing channels, 10 (3.84%) and 17 (5.5%) eggs were positive for Salmonella, respectively. Among the
isolates, S. Typhimurium was the predominant serovar. Antibiogram testing revealed multi-drug resistance
among Salmonella isolates from chicken eggs collected from poultry farms and marketing channels in north
India. All the isolates were resistant to bacitracin, polymyxin-B and colistin, whereas sensitivity was recorded
for ciproﬂoxacin, streptomycin and enroﬂoxacin.

1. Introduction

Salmonellosis is one of the most important food-borne bacterial
zoonotic diseases worldwide. It also causes great economic loss in
poultry especially in young chickens in terms of heavy morbidity and
mortality. Poultry eggs are frequently involved in the transmission of
Salmonella. Among the serovars of Salmonella, Typhimurium and
Enteritidis have been of great concern from egg-borne human
salmonellosis (Henzler, Kradel, & Sischo, 1998; Krishnamoorthy,
Paul, Premkumar, & Govindrajan, 2003; Messens et al., 2007 and
Suresh, Hatha, Sreenivasan, Sangeetha, & Lashmanaperumalsamy,
2006). The intestinal tract is the primary reservoir of Salmonella in
poultry birds leading to contamination to chicken eggs in cloacal
region through horizontal route. Trans-ovarian transmission from
infected chickens is another important route of contamination of
chicken eggs leading to egg-borne salmonellosis.

Success of Salmonella control depends mainly on the choice of
therapeutic agent used (Rimler & Glisson, 1997). Injudicious use of
antibiotics without conducting antibiotic sensitivity proﬁle may lead
to development of resistance among the bacterial strains rendering
control programme ineffective. This necessitates the periodic assess-
ment of sensitivity/resistance proﬁle of Salmonella serovars prevalent

in a particular region to enable the Salmonella control programme
effective. Moreover, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in food animals
threaten the efﬁcacy of human drugs if antimicrobial-resistant genes
become incorporated into human bacterial populations (Smith,
Harris, Johnson, Silbergeld, & Morris, 2002). Information on preva-
lence of Salmonella serovars in India is fragmentary and no systematic
literature is available on prevalence of Salmonella serovars from
production to market level which is essential in understanding the
dynamics of Salmonella contamination from poultry farm and in
marketing channels.

Therefore, the present investigation was carried out to study the
contamination of Salmonella serovars in chicken eggs at farm level and
then subsequently in the marketing channels and to assess the
antibiogram of Salmonella serovars to enable selection of effective
chemotherapeutic agents.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sample collection

In the present study, a total of 560 chicken eggs were collected
aseptically from various poultry farms (260 eggs) and marketing
channels (300 eggs) with 150 eggs each from whole sale and retail
outlets during the period of April 2006 to July 2007 in North India
(Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Delhi and Uttrakhand). The samples
were transported to lab under aseptic conditions and processed
immediately for the isolation of Salmonella.

2.2. Isolation and identiﬁcation of Salmonella

2.2.1. Egg shell surface

For the isolation of Salmonella from egg shell surface, a sterile
cotton swab wetted in sterilized normal saline solution (NSS) was
used for surface swabbing and it was re-immersed into the same tube
having 10 ml normal saline solution, then transferred to 90 ml of
Buffered Peptone Water (BPW) and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h.

2.2.2. Egg albumin and yolk

Five ml of Egg albumin and yolk were separately mixed with 5 ml
of NSS and transferred to 90 ml of BPW and incubated at 37 °C for
18 h.

One ml and 0.1 ml of pre-enriched samples were added to 10 ml of
Tetrathionate (TT) broth and Rappaport Vassiliadis (RV) broth,
respectively, for all the samples individually and incubated at 37 °C
for 24 h. After enrichment of the samples, they were streaked on
Hektoen Enteric Agar (HEA) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Typical
black centered and smooth colonies showing greenish periphery,
giving bull eye appearance on plates were selected and subjected for
biochemical characterization (motility, nitrate reduction, indole test,
methyl red, Voges proskauer, citrate utilization, urease,
lysine
decarboxylase, etc.) employing standard methods (Agarwal, Bhile-
gaonkar, Singh, Kumar, & Rathore, 2003). Serotyping of Salmonella
isolates was done at National Salmonella Centre (Vet.),
Indian
Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, Bareilly.

2.3. Antibiotic sensitivity of Salmonella serovars

All the Salmonella isolated in the present study were examined for
their antimicrobial susceptibility/resistance pattern by disc diffusion
technique (Bauer, Kirby, Sherris, & Turk, 1966) against a panel of 21
antibiotics. Antimicrobials used, and their concentrations are as
follows: ampicillin (10 mcg), chloramphenicol (30 mcg), ciproﬂox-
acin (10 mcg), gentamicin (10 mcg), kanamycin (30 mcg), neomycin
(30 mcg), polymixin B (30 mcg), sulphamethoxazole (25 mcg),
tetracycline (30 mcg), cephalexin (30 mcg), oxytetracycline
(30 mcg), bacitracin (30 mcg), colistin (10 mcg), sulphaphenazole
(30 mcg), erythromycin (15 mcg), amoxicillin (20 mcg), doxycycline
(30 mcg), trimethoprim (5 mcg), sulphamethizole (25 mcg), strepto-
mycin (10 mcg) and enroﬂoxacin (10 mcg). All the antimicrobial discs
were purchased from Himedia, Mumbai. Salmonella isolates were
grown in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth, smeared on Muller-Hinton
(MH) agar plates and antibiotic discs were placed on its surface and
plates were kept for overnight incubation. The result was interpreted
as sensitive, intermediate, or resistance by comparing with manu-
factures instruction.

Multiple antibiotic resistances (MARs) index for each resistance

pattern was calculated by employing the formula given below.
MARindex = Number of resistanceantibiotics = totalnumber of antibioticstested

*Isolates classiﬁed as intermediate on the basis of inhibition zone

were considered as sensitive for MAR index.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Incidence of Salmonella in eggs

Since Salmonella is an important zoonotic bacterium with poultry
as largest single reservoir of Salmonella (Gupta, Ray, & Sharma, 1999),
the assessment of the contamination level and site of contamination is
of utmost importance in deciding the control strategies against
Salmonella in chickens. The contamination of Salmonella in the
internal content of chicken eggs can be due to infection in the ovary
of birds (Barnhart, Dressen, Bastien, & Pancorbs, 1991) while surface

contamination of eggs can be through feces, feed, insects, or through
handling, transport or storage material.

The present investigation indicated the incidence of Salmonella in
chicken egg samples at 4.82% level with lower incidence level in fresh
farm eggs as compared to eggs collected from markets. In an earlier
study conducted in India, incidence level of 10.8% in 534 chicken eggs
was observed by Bajaj, Sharma, and Thakur (2003) with higher
incidence on egg shell surface than internal contents. Surveys
conducted in England and Wales have also shown egg contamination
level of Salmonella to be 0.2% to 1.6% (De Louvois, 1994) which is
lower than the present study. Out of 260 chicken eggs collected from
selected poultry farms, 10 (3.84%) were found positive for Salmonella
(Table 1). Two eggs had only surface contamination, 7 eggs were
contaminated only in their yolk contents and from one egg Salmonella
was isolated from surface as well as from yolk. Out of the 300 eggs
collected from marketing channels, 17 (5.6%) were found positive for
Salmonella. Prevalence of Salmonella in eggs from whole sale and retail
market was found to be 4% (6/150) and 7.4% (11/150), respectively.
From the Salmonella isolates having origin from whole sale markets, 3
eggs each had surface as well as egg yolk contents contamination
while isolates from retail markets, 7 eggs had only surface
contamination, 2 eggs were contaminated only in their egg yolk
contents and from 2 eggs Salmonella was isolated from surface as well
as from yolk contents. Overall, the results indicated that incidence of
Salmonella on egg shell surface and egg yolk was found to be similar.
No Salmonella could be isolated from egg albumen of all the eggs
screened.

The higher incidence of Salmonella in the market eggs may be due
to surface contamination during handling, storage and transportation
while contamination in the internal contents points to infection of
hen. In the present investigation, Out of 27 Salmonella isolates, 15
(55.5%) were identiﬁed as S. Typhimurium, 6 (22.2%) as S. Lagos, 4
(14.8%) as rough Salmonella and 1 (3.7%) each as S. Africana and
Salmonella II. Among the ten isolates from poultry farms, 9 (90%) were
S. Typhimurium while 1 (10%) was S. Africana. Similarly, out of 17
Salmonella isolates from marketing eggs, 6 (35.29%) were S.
Typhimurium, 6 (35.29%) S. Lagos, 4 rough Salmonella (23.53%) and
1 (5.89%) was S. II. Salmonella Typhimurium was the predominant
serovar isolated in this region. Murugkar, Rahman, Kumar, and
Bhattacharyya (2005) also reported isolation of S. Typhimurium in
higher proportion as compared to other serovars from cloacal swabs
of poultry in north-eastern part of India. Isolation of S. Typhimurium
in eggs was also reported by other workers (Ohtsuka, Yanagawa,
Takatoxi, & Hara-Kudo, 2005; Otomo et al., 2007). S. Enteritidis was
not isolated in chicken eggs collected from poultry farms as well as in
marketing channels in the present investigation indicating the
changing dynamics of Salmonella serovars occurrence in this region
(Table 2).

In the present study, two enrichment broths Tetrathionate (TT)
and Rappaport Vassiliadis (RV) were compared for Salmonella
isolation. RV broth was found to be comparatively better in recovering

Salmonella spp. as isolates grew better and luxuriantly in this broth as
compared to TT broth where growth was very slow and sometimes
not appreciable even after longer duration of incubation. Out of 27
Salmonella isolates 15 were isolated from RV broth. Valentine-Bon,
Brackett, Sco, Mammock, and Andrews (2003) also observed higher
isolation from RV broth in comparison to TT broth. The TT and RV
broths contains brilliant green dye or magnesium chloride and
malachite green oxalate, respectively, to inhibit the growth of Gram
positive bacteria and other indigenous microﬂora. RV gives satisfac-
tory results because it is very effective at suppressing growth of other
bacteria. This may be the reason for comparatively more efﬁcacy of RV
broth than TT in the present study.

Moreover, the use of a three step protocol (pre-enrichment,
selective enrichment and selective plating) as speciﬁed in the FDA's
Bacteriological Analytical Manual (US Food Drug Administration,
2002) was found satisfactory for the recovery of Salmonella spp. from
eggs. Sequential enrichment in non-selective and selective media
allows enhanced detection and recovery of sub lethally injured
Salmonella (Van Schothorst, & Van Leusden, 1975), because Salmonella
can be present in eggs in such small number that they may not be
detected by the direct method regardless of the size of eggs (Chen,
Anantheswaran, & Knabel, 2001; Stephenson, Satchell, Allen, &
Andraws, 1991).

3.2. Antimicrobial resistance patterns

The results of resistance analysis of the isolated Salmonella strains
against 21 antimicrobial agents are presented in Table 3. The
sensitivity pattern indicated that all strains were 100% sensitive to
ciproﬂoxacin, tetracycline, streptomycin and enroﬂoxacin followed by
peﬂoxacin (92.59%), kanamycin (81.48%), gentamicin (59.26%) and
trimethoprim (59.26%). Complete susceptibility for ciproﬂoxacin was
also reported by other workers (Gulsen, Eloin, & Arli, 2004; Lestari,
Han, Wang, & Ge, 2009 and Zhao et al., 2006). Poultry farm isolates
were sensitive to most of the antibiotics. All the strains exhibited
absolute (100%) resistance against bacitracin, polymyxin-B and
colistin. Kavitha, Chaturvedi, and Pandey (2008) and Suresh et al.
(2006) also observed complete resistance for colistin and polymyxin-
B, respectively. Resistance to sulphaphenazole and sulphamethazole
was observed among the isolates from poultry farm and marketing
channels (whole sale and retail outlet). Other workers have also
reported resistance for sulphamethazole (Steven et al., 2006 and Zhao
et al., 2006). While, most of the strains from poultry farm and retail
market showed resistance against doxycycline but no resistance was
observed for it among the isolates of whole sale market.

Among all the Salmonella isolates from different sources 24
antibiotic resistance patterns were observed indicating wide spread
multi-drug resistance (Table 4). Two isolates from retail outlets were
resistant to as many as 10 antibiotics whereas, 2 isolates were
resistant to 9 antibiotics, 2 to 8 and 5 to 7 antibiotics. Multiple
antibiotic resistances (MARs) index indicated that Salmonella isolated
from eggs of retail market had highest MAR index (0.385) followed by
eggs from whole sale (0.372) and poultry farms (0.328). The logical
interpretation of the results of the multiple antibiotic resistances is

that all Salmonella isolated in the study might have originated from
environments where antimicrobials are often used. Novick (1981)
and Nowroozi, Mirzaii, and Norauzi (2004) also demonstrated that
indiscriminate use of antibiotics in poultry production and eggs has
increased the emergence and maintenance of MAR bacteria in the
environment.

Antibiotic sensitivity pattern of Salmonella serovars is changing
drastically and with the emergence of resistance against most
commonly used antibiotics, the problem arises in treatment of
salmonellosis in poultry birds. According to the investigation,
ciproﬂoxacin, streptomycin and enroﬂoxacin can be drug of choice
because no Salmonella serovar exhibited resistance against these
antibiotics. Peﬂoxacin can also be useful in treatment of chickens
because of low resistance among the Salmonella isolates from this
region. Shivhare, Sharda, Sharma, and Reddy (2000) tested in-vitro
susceptibility of Salmonella isolates of avian origin and found that
majority of isolates were sensitive to ciproﬂoxacin, enroﬂoxacin,
sparﬂoxacin, norﬂoxacin and peﬂoxacin. These drugs belonging to
ﬂuroquinolones group of antibiotics have rapid and prompt bacteri-
cidal action at a very low minimum inhibitory concentration against
Salmonella (Hooper, 1995). Keeping in view the wide range of
resistance showed by Salmonella serovars, the assessment of anti-
biogram of Salmonella isolates is often advantageous for identiﬁcation
of effective antimicrobial agent to be used by poultry practitioners for
therapeutic purpose since without assessment of antibiogram there
may be heavy morbidity and mortality in poultry. In addition to the
need of pre-testing of antibiotic efﬁcacy, the indiscriminate use of
antibiotics in feed of poultry should be checked.

The present investigation indicated occurrence of Salmonella in
chicken eggs at low level, however, detection of Salmonella from
chicken egg yolk needs greater concern for effective control of
salmonellosis in poultry birds. Moreover, measures to reduce surface
contamination of chicken eggs with Salmonella during transport and
handling needs to be improved. Most serovars of Salmonella isolated
in the study also showed resistance to other commonly used
antibiotics and this problem is increasing because of injudicious use
of antibiotics both as prophylactic as well as therapeutic agents.
Therefore, it is suggested that the most effective control programme,
following assessment of antibiogram proﬁle, be used in a particular
region where outbreaks of Salmonella are encountered.
