Avian ESBL-producing Escherichia coli
isolates have been increasingly reported
worldwide. Animal
to human dissemination, via food chain or direct contact, of
these resistant bacteria has been reported. In Tunisia, little is known about avian
ESBL- producing E. coli and further studies are needed. Seventeen ESBL-producing
Escherichia coli
isolates from poultry feces from two farms (Farm 1 and farm 2) in
the North of Tunisia have been used in this study. Eleven of these isolates (from
farm 1) have the same resistance proﬁle to nalidixic acid, sulfonamides, streptomycin,
tetracycline, and norﬂoxacine (intermediately resistant). Out of the six isolates recovered
from farm 2, only one was co-resistant to tetracycline. All isolates, except one, harbored
blaCTX-M-1 gene, and one strain co-harbored the blaTEM-1 gene. The genes tetA and tetB
were carried, respectively, by 11 and 1 amongst the 12 tetracycline-resistant isolates.
Sulfonamides resistance was encoded by sul1, sul2, and sul3 genes in 3, 17, and 5
isolates, respectively. The qnrB1 was detected in nine strains, one of which co-harbored
qnrS1 gene. The search for the class 1 and 2 integrons by PCR showed that in farm
1, class 1 and 2 integrons were found in one and ten isolates, respectively. In farm 2,
class 1 integron was found in only one isolate, class 2 was not detected. Only one
gene cassette arrangement was demonstrated in the variable regions (VR) of the 10
int2-positive isolates: dfrA1- sat2-aadA1. The size of the VR of the class 1 integron
was approximately 250 bp in one int1-positive isolate, whereas in the second isolate, no
ampliﬁcation was observed. All isolates of farm 1 belong to the phylogroup A (sub-group
A0). However, different types of phylogroups in farm 2 were detected. Each of the
phylogroups A1, B22, B23 was detected in one strain, while the D2 phylogroup was
found in 3 isolates. The virulence genes iutA, ﬁmH, and traT were detected in 3, 7, and
3 isolates, respectively. Two types of gene combination were detected: iutA+ﬁmH+traT
in 3 isolates and iutA+ﬁmH in one isolate. The isolates recovered in farm 1 showed
the same proﬁle of PFGE macro-restriction, while isolates of farm 2 presented unrelated
PFGE patterns. We conclude that these avian ESBL-producing E. coli
isolates show
homo- and heterogenic genetic background and that plasmids harboring ESBL genes
could be involved in the dissemination of this resistance phenotype.

Introduction

Escherichia coli is a commensal bacterium in humans and animals
and considered an indicator of fecal contamination of food.
Antimicrobial resistant isolates and resistance genes of E. coli
can be transferred to humans through the food chain. This
transfer represents a potential risk for public health (Alexander
et al., 2010; Cortés et al., 2010; Canton et al., 2012; Ryu
et al., 2012). The use of broad-spectrum cephalosporins in
animals, such as ceftiofur and cefquinome, has been recognized
a major driving force for the selection and spread of extended
spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) (Dutil et al., 2010). In both
reservoirs, high prevalence of genes belonging to CTX-M group
dominates. Numerous data highlight the extent to which certain
ESBL genes, ESBL plasmids or ESBL-producing clones are
shared between animals and humans (Naseer and Sundsfjord,
2011).

in enhancing the knowledge of

In recent years, there has been increasing concern in the
scientiﬁc community about the emergence and dissemination
of E. coli strains producing ESBLs, especially of the CTX-M
class, which are very frequently associated with community
infections (Eckert et al., 2004; Livermore et al., 2007; Pitout
and Laupland, 2008). Recently, diﬀerent reports have indicated
the dissemination of ESBL-positive E. coli strains among the
intestinal microbiota of healthy humans (Vinué et al., 2009),
in food producing animals, and in food products (Brinas
et al., 2005; Blanc et al., 2006; Girlich et al., 2007; Jouini
et al., 2007; Li et al., 2007; Smet et al., 2008). These resistant
bacteria could be transferred to humans through the food
chain. This transfer represents a problem for public health.
Comparison of human and animal ESBL-producing isolates
is important
the potential
routes of transfer of these bacteria and resistance genes in
diﬀerent ecosystems. In Tunisia, ESBL-producers were initially
reported from food samples such as raw chicken meat (Jouini
et al., 2007; Ben Slama et al., 2010). More recently, ESBL-
producing E. coli were described in healthy food animals at
farm level (Ben Sallem et al., 2012b, 2013; Mnif et al., 2012).
In Tunisia, ESBL-producing bacteria were found in chickens
and a dromedary, suggesting that poultry constitutes a major
reservoir of ESBL genes. The dominant ESBL gene found was
blaCTX-M-1, which was mainly detected with IncI1 replicons
(Mnif et al., 2012). A recent study also demonstrated that
the blaCTX-M-1 IncI1/ST3 plasmid was dominant in Tunisian
chickens and pets (Grami et al., 2013). Finally, recent data showed
that 7.3% of Tunisian healthy humans were fecal carriers of
CTX-M-1-producing E. coli. This ﬁnding suggests that foodstuﬀ
of poultry origin may contribute to the transmission of the
blaCTX-M-1 gene from animals to humans (Ben Sallem et al.,
2012b).

The aim of this study was to characterize ESBL producing
E. coli isolates recovered from feces of healthy chickens in
Tunisia by investigating genes encoding ESBL, resistance to
tetracycline, sulfonamides and ﬂuoroquinolones as well as
content of virulence genes,
integrons, and genetic clonality
using PFGE.

Materials and Methods

Bacterial Strains
Sixty-ﬁve fecal samples were collected from healthy chickens in
2013. Of these samples, 45 came from 58-week-old chickens in
a farm located at Sidi Thabet in the North of Tunisia (Farm 1)
and 20 from 7-week-old chickens in a farm located at Morneg
region (Farm 2). These samples were cultivated on Mac-Conkey
agar containing 2 mg/L of cefotaxime and incubated overnight at
37◦C. For each sample, one colony with typical E. coli trait was
picked and re-isolated on Mac-Conkey agar and the phenotypic
identiﬁcation result was conﬁrmed using Api20E (Bio-Mérieux,
France).

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing and ESBL
Identiﬁcation
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out using the
agar disk diﬀusion method on Mueller–Hinton agar plates
in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute
Standards
Institute, 2012). The following antimicrobial agents were
tested (µg/disk): ampicillin (10), amoxicillin (25), amoxicillin-
clavulanic acid (20/10), ceftazidime (30), cefotaxime (30),
gentamicin (10), kanamycin (30), streptomycin (10), amikacin
(30),
tetracycline
(30), nalidixic acid (30), ciproﬂoxacin (5), sulfonamides (200)
and chloramphenicol (50). The Double-Disk Synergy Test
(DDST) with cefotaxime or ceftazidime in the proximity to
amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was used for the screening of
ESBL (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2012). E.
coli ATCC25922 was used as ESBL negative and Klebsiella
pneumoniae 700603 was used as ESBL positive reference
strain.

trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazol (1.25/23.75),

Resistance Genotype
All primers used to characterize the resistance genotype are
presented in Table 1. The presence of genes encoding TEM,
SHV, CTX-M implicated in the beta-lactam resistance was
analyzed by PCR (Sáenz, et al., 2004; Batchelor et al., 2005).
Ampliﬁed DNA fragments were sequenced on both strands
and the nucleotide and their deduced amino acid sequences
were compared with those included in the Gen-Bank database
as well as with those deposited at the website http://www.
lahey.org/Studies/ in order to conﬁrm the speciﬁc type of β-
lactamase gene (Sáenz, et al., 2004; Batchelor et al., 2005).
Genes encoding resistance to tetracycline (tetA, tetB, and tetC),
sulfonamide (sul1, sul2, and sul3), and quinolones (qnrA, qnrB,
and qnrS) were investigated by PCR as reported previously
(Sáenz, et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2008; Rocha-Gracia et al.,
2010). For positive isolates, PCR products of qnrB and qnrS
were sequenced. The presence and characterization of integrons
were studied by PCR of the class 1 and 2 integrase encoding
genes as well as the 3′ conserved region (qacE1 + sul1
genes) (Table 1) and by PCR and subsequent sequencing of
the variables regions (VRs) of these integrons (Sáenz, et al.,
2004).

Virulence Genotyping
The presence of 30 virulence genes (ﬁmA, TartT, iutA, MaIX, Ibe,
FyuA, BmaE, papGalleleIII, papC, colV, cdtB, papG alleleI, nfaE,
SfaS, iha, iss, ire, ehxA, sxt1, sxt2, eltA, fasA, estII, aggC, esat1,
cdt, ipah, hly, cnf1, and bfp) was determined by using PCR in
all ESBL-positive E. coli strains (Chapman et al., 2006; Wu et al.,
2007).

Clonal and Phylogenetic Analysis of E. coli
Isolates
Chromosomal DNA was prepared as previously described
using the restriction enzyme XbaI (Amersham Life Sciences,
Uppsala, Sweden) (Kaufmann, 1998). DNA fragments were

separated by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gels (pulsed-ﬁeld
agarose certiﬁed; Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, United Kingdom)
and 0.5 X Tris-borate-EDTA buﬀer using a contour-clamped
homogeneous electric ﬁeld (CHEF-DRIII system; Bio-Rad)
under
the following electrophoresis conditions: 12◦C at
6 V/cm for 27 h with pulse times ranging from 10 to 40
s. Clonal relationships were established following Tenover
criteria (Tenover et al., 1995). E. coli Isolates were allotted to
phylogenetic groups A, B1, B2, or D, using a triplex PCR assay
targeting the chuA, yjaA genes and the DNA fragment TSPE4.C2
(Clermont et al., 2000). Strains were sub-grouped according
to Escobar-Paramo et al. (2006): subgroup A0: chuA-, yjaA-,
and TspE4.C2-; subgroup A1: chuA-, yjaA+, and TspE4.C2-;

positive and negative controls were included in the assay.

Results

Occurrence of ESBL-producing E. coli Isolates
and Antibiotic Susceptibility
Eleven (24%) and 6 (30%) ESBL-producing E. coli
isolates
were detected in the 45 and 20 fecal samples collected in
farm 1 and in farm 2, respectively. In addition to ESBL
production, isolates in farm 1 have the same proﬁle of resistance
to nalidixic acid, norﬂoxacine (intermediate), trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole, sulfonamides, streptomycin and tetracycline.
But,
they remained susceptible to imipenem, gentamicin,
tobramycin and chloramphenicol. With the exception of one
strain that was co-resistant
from
farm 2, were susceptible to all non beta-lactam antibiotics
(Table 2).

to tetracycline,

isolates,

Gene Coding for the Production of ESBL
PCR and sequencing showed that all strains, except one, harbored
the blaCTX-M-1 genes. One strain co-harbored blaTEM-1 gene. The
blaSHV gene was not detected.

Occurrence of Class 1 and 2 Integrons
In farm 1, class 1 and 2 integrons were found in one and ten
isolates, respectively. In farm 2, class 1 integron was found in only
one isolate, while class 2 was not detected. Ampliﬁcation of the

VRs of class 2 integrons showed identical DNA fragments with
an approximate size of 2000 bp. All these VRs contained a unique
gene cassette arrangement, being dfrA1- sat2-aadA1, encoding
resistance for trimethoprim, streptothricin and streptomycin,
respectively. In one isolate, the VR of class 1 integron was
ampliﬁed and yielded a DNA fragment of ca. 250 bp, whereas no
ampliﬁcation was observed in the second int1-positive isolate.

Determination of Phylogroups and Virulence
Factors
In farm 1, all isolates were found to belong to phylogroup A (sub-
group A0); however, diﬀerent phylogroups were detected in farm
2 (A1, B22, and B23, each in one isolate, and D2, in 3 isolates).
The virulence genes iut(A), ﬁmH, and traT were detected in 3,
7, and 3 isolates, respectively. The other genes were not detected
in our collection. Two types of gene combination were detected:
iutA+ﬁmH+traT (in 3 isolates); iutA+ﬁmH (in one isolate).

Genes Encoding Tetracycline-, Sulphonamide,
and Fluroquinolones Resistance
Amongst the 12 tetracycline-resistant isolates, eleven and one
carried tetA and tetB, respectively. Sulfonamides resistance was
encoded by sul1, sul2 and sul3 genes in 3, 17 and 5 isolates,
respectively. Gene qnrB1 was detected in 9 isolates, one of them
co-harbored qnrS1 gene.

PFGE Typing
All isolates from farm 1 were clonally related, while isolates of the
farm 2 were genetically unrelated (Figure 1).

Avian ESBL-producing Escherichia coli isolates from Tunisia

and other food products of animal origin can contribute to the
transmission of this gene or these strains to humans. Indeed, it
was recently demonstrated that E. coli containing CTX-M-1 was
identiﬁed in 7.3% of healthy Tunisians (Ben Sallem et al., 2012a).
Identical or closely related isolates from humans and animals
have been previously reported in Netherlands, suggesting a likely
transmission of ESBL-E. coli isolates from poultry to human,
most probably via the food chain (Overdevest et al., 2011). More
recently, Chinese data showed a high occurrence of CTX-M-14
in isolates from animals where this enzyme is very widespread
in human isolates (Zheng et al., 2012). In the EC68 strain,
no bla gene was detected. This strain could harbor a gene
not investigated in our study. Further investigation must be
undertaken. Antibiotic resistance, especially the multiresistance,
has been mainly linked to the dissemination of linked genes
encoding resistance inserted in mobile genetic elements, mainly
integrons. Integron of class 1 was found in two isolates while
integron of class 2 in ten isolates. Our results are not in
agreement with other ﬁndings, which showed the dominance
of integron of class 1 in animal-derived E. coli or in animal
products as well as human isolates (Machado et al., 2005; Souﬁ
et al., 2009, 2011; Ben Slama et al., 2010; Cergole-Novella et al.,
2010). Two hypotheses could explain our ﬁnding: ﬁrstly, the
real absence of class 1 integrons in the integron-free isolates,
as reported by other authors (Jouini et al., 2007; Ben Sallem
et al., 2012b). Secondly, the presence of insertion sequences, such
as IS26, truncating the intI and thus, leading to inhibition of
PCR ampliﬁcation. In the case of truncated intI gene by IS26,
the use of other primers was proposed (Marchant et al., 2013).
Owing to a number of ﬁnancial limitations, we could not realize
these PCRs actually. The then int2-positive isolates presented
an identical gene cassette array in their VRs: dfrA-sat2-aadA1,
being frequent in other studies (Souﬁ et al., 2009, 2011). The
integrase Int2 is not functional and thus unable to integrate
new gene cassettes into the variable region, other than those
already present (Partridge et al., 2009). The variable region of
the class 2 integron mainly carries dfrA1 (encoding trimethoprim
resistance), sat1 (encoding streptothricin resistance) and aadA1
(encoding streptomycin/spectinomycin resistance) (Partridge
et al., 2009; Souﬁ et al., 2009, 2011). The size of the VR of
class 1 integron in EC172 was approximately 250 bp, a fragment
that cannot correspond to any gene cassette of the known ones
(Ravi et al., 2014). The VR of class 1 integron in EC67 was not
ampliﬁed; this might suggest an empty VR or mismatches of used
primers.

Tetracycline resistance was encoded by tetA and tetB genes
in 11 and one tetracycline-resistant isolates, respectively. This
ﬁnding was also reported by other studies (Koo and Woo,
2011; Xibiao et al., 2011), while the tetC gene is rarely reported
(Skoèková et al., 2013). The sul1, sul2 and sul3 genes were
detected in 3, 17, and 5 isolates, respectively, not only amongst
sulfonamid resistant isolates, but also in the six-sulfonamide
susceptible isolates. In other reports, sul1 is most frequently
reported followed by sul2 gene while sul3 gene is generally less

Discussion

We collected 65 samples of feces from 45 reproductive 58-weeks-
old chickens in a public farm in the region of Sidi Thabet
(30 Km Nord-West of Tunis, Tunisia) (Farm1) and 20 samples
of 7-weeks-old breeder chickens in the region of Morneg (Farm
2). Seventeen samples (26.1%) contained cefotaxime-resistant
isolates, 11 (24%) and 6 (30%) positives samples were observed
in farms 1 and 2, respectively. The frequency of cefotaxime-
resistant isolates is similar to those reported by other authors
worldwide (2%; 31.7%) (Dierikx et al., 2013; Randall et al., 2014),
but lower than those found by other studies in Tunisia (42% and
45, 5%) (Ben Sallem et al., 2012b; Mnif et al., 2012). In our study,
all isolates from farm 1 exhibited the same resistance proﬁle
to nalidixic acid, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, sulfonamides,
streptomycin,
tetracycline and norﬂoxacine (intermediately
resistant). These resistance markers are often reported in
previous Tunisian studies (Ben Slama et al., 2010; Mnif et al.,
2012). All isolates were susceptible to imipenem, gentamicin,
kanamycin and chloramphenicol. Indeed, low rates of resistance
to these antibiotics have been reported worldwide (Grami et al.,
2013). However, the 6 isolates from farm 2, except one that
was co-resistant to tetracycline, were susceptible to all antibiotics
tested. Worldwide, the CTX-M group has been emerged as the
predominant determinant encoding ESBL production in human
and animal Enterobacteriaceae, especially E. coli (Girlich et al.,
2007; Coque et al., 2008; Nicolas-Chanoine et al., 2008; Dahmen
et al., 2012, 2013). The blaCTX-M-1 gene was ampliﬁed in 16
out of 17 isolates;
in addition, one isolate co-harbored the
blaTEM-1 gene. This result is in agreement with those of other
Tunisian ﬁndings (Jouini et al., 2007, 2009; Ben Slama et al.,
2010; Ben Sallem et al., 2012b, 2013; Mnif et al., 2012). The
high rate occurrence of E. coli harboring blaCTX-M-1 in poultry

resistance determining region (QRDR) of DNA gyrase (gyrA and
gyrB) and topoisomerases IV (parC and parE) (Hawkey, 2003).
However, Plasmid Mediate Quinolone Resistance (PMQR) genes
such as qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrD, qnrS, qepA, and aac(6′)Ib-cr
have been increasingly reported in bacterial pathogens since 2000
(Strahilevitz et al., 2009). In our study, among 11 isolates resistant
to nalidixic acid and intermediately susceptible sensibility to
norﬂoxacine, seven isolates carried qnrB1 gene and one also
co-heberged qnrS1 gene. These two genes were often reported
by other authors worldwide (Ben Sallem et al., 2013, 2014;
Ferjani et al., 2014) in E. coli producers of CTX-M from
human and animal origin. In our study, we did not consider
qepA and aac (6′)-Ib-cr genes, while other authors reported
their presence in E. coli from animal origin (Ma et al., 2009;
Xie et al., 2014). The qnr gene types have no big eﬀect on
the increase of minimal
inhibitory concentration (MIC) of
ﬂuoroquinolones (ciproﬂoxacine and norﬂoxacine) and were
generally not detected by disk diﬀusion method. Indeed, the
resistance toward quinolones in 7 amongst the 11 nalidixic acid
resistant isolates could be explained by these qnr genes but it
could also certainly explained by the presence of chromosomal
mutations in QRDR of GyrA and/or ParC (Abbassi et al.,
2010). The quinolone-susceptible isolate containing qnrB1 gene
conﬁrmed the low level expression of this resistance (in term of
increase of MIC).

Concerning the distribution of pathogenic E. coli strains
it is well-known that pathogenic
according to phylogroups,
strains producing extra-intestinal
infections (ExPEC) belong
mainly to the B2 group and less to the D group. They are
responsible for meningitidis, abscess, peritonitis, septicemia and
urinary tract infections (Le Gall et al., 2007; Nandanwar et al.,
2014); while, groups A and B1 E. coli strains are considered non-
virulent commensal strains (Ewers et al., 2007). All the strains
of farm 1 were found to belong to the phylogroup A (sub-type
A0), while, the strains of farm 2 to phylogroups A (A1, 1 isolate),
D (D2, 3 isolates) and B2 (B22, 1 isolate; B23, 1 isolate). In the
literature, the majority of animal E. coli isolates producing ESBL
belonged to phylogroup A and B1 (Mnif et al., 2012; Huber
et al., 2013) contrary to human isolates, which mainly belonged
to B2 phylogroup. The low number of virulence genes detected
was in relation with the appurtenance of our isolates (12/17)
to the phylogroup A. Strains of phylogroups B2 and D were

somewhat distinguished from strains of phylogroup A by the
occurrence of the ﬁmbrial ﬁmH gene and the serum resistance-
associated outer membrane (traT). The low number of genes
detected could be explained by ﬁtness notion or the competitively
of strains. Indeed, these avian intestinal E. coli isolates were under
selective presser by antibiotics. This selective pressure enhances
the expansion and maintenance of antibiotic-resistant strains
rather than virulent ones.

the 11 isolates of

PFGE showed that

the farm 1 were
indistinguishable, while isolates of farm 2 were unrelated. The
cloanlity of
these isolates would evoke a strong power of
dissemination of clonal isolates in this poultry breeding. The
diﬀerence in genetic contents in isolates of farm2 (sul genes,
qnr genes and virulence genes) might be due to independent
acquisition of genes carried by plasmids or integrons.

Conclusion

Despite the limited samples analyzed in this study, that might
not reﬂect the real epidemiological situation of avian ESBL-
producing E. coli in these two farms, our study showed two
typical epidemiologic characteristics of ESBL-producing bacteria.
Firstly, clonal isolates are disseminated within the same farm.
Secondly, “singleton” isolates occur with limited ability of spread,
evoking the potential horizontal transfer of ESBL genes between
diﬀerent E. coli populations. Plasmids or integrons might be
implicated in the mobilization of blaCTX-M-1 genes among avian
isolates. Further studies should be performed in the future to
track the evolution of ESBL types and their frequencies in
diﬀerent ecosystems.
