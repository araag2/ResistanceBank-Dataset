The study was undertaken to investigate the occurrence and to characterize the ESBL/beta-lactamase producing-
Escherichia coli in healthy pigs of organized and backyard farms in West Bengal, India. Total 200 rectal swabs were
collected randomly from healthy pigs maintained in four organized farms and 10 backyard farms (n = 100 each)
and 76 isolates were identiﬁed as E. coli from organized (48/100, 48%) and backyard pigs (28/100, 28%). Twelve E.
coli isolates (6%) in the present study were detected to possess any of the ESBL/beta-lactamase genes studied.
ESBL/beta-lactamase producers were isolated with signiﬁcantly more frequency from backyard pigs than the or-
ganized farm pigs (p = 0.026). Six of ESBL/beta-lactamase producing isolates were phenotypically conﬁrmed as
CTX-M producers and ten of them were conﬁrmed as TEM/SHV producers. PCR and sequencing of the ampliﬁed
product from representative isolates revealed the presence of blaCTX-M-9, blaSHV-12 and blaTEM-1. No unique combi-
nation of the studied beta lactamase genes for organized and backyard farm pig isolates was noted. The ESBL iso-
lates belonged to O13, O55, O133, O153, O157, O158, O166, rough and OUT serogroups. The association of heat
labile toxin (elt) (p b 0.0005) with organized farm isolates and heat stable toxin (estA) (p = 0.0143) with back-
yard piggery sector was signiﬁcantly higher. The ESBL/beta-lactamase producers from organized farm (Ak/Ex)
and indigenous pigs (Ak/Ex/Te; Ak/CoT/G) showed a characteristic phenotypical antibiotic resistance pattern.
Two pairs of isolates from organized and backyard farm pigs showed clonal relationship indicating a possible
transmission between the farms which were situated adjacently. Thus the present study revealed backyard
farm pigs as major source of ESBL/beta-lactamase producing-E. coli associated with STa and characteristic antibi-
otic resistance pattern in India.

pathogenic bacteria present in the animal gut possibly trigger such in-
fection in human patients (Valentin et al., 2014). Escherichia coli are
one of such commensal bacteria present in the gut of both animals
and humans and the pathogenic strains are associated with intestinal
and extra-intestinal infection both in human and animals (Samanta,
2013). The commensal E. coli present in food animals can also acquire
the antibiotic resistance determinants via mobile genetic elements ei-
ther from the animal itself which are maintained under different antibi-
otic selection pressures or from the environment (Gonzalez-Zorn and
Escudero, 2012). E. coli are transmitted to human through the food
chain during slaughter, improper cooking and unhygienic handling of
food (Frye and Jackson, 2013). Transfer of antibiotic resistance determi-
nants through E. coli may complicate the therapeutic regimen in the face
of infection as the same families of antibiotics are used in human also
(Samanta et al., 2014).

The commensal E. coli of healthy food animals possessing antibiotic
resistance determinants is a global concern nowadays. Production of ex-
tended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) enzymes is one of the major
mechanisms instrumental in enterobacteriaceae family for their resis-
tance which is detected against the penicillin, second, third and fourth
generations of cephalosporins and monobactams (except cephamycins
and carbapenems). There are three classical ESBLs i.e. TEM (except
TEM-1), SHV (except SHV-1 and 2) and CTX-M (EFSA Panel on
Biological Hazards, 2011). Among them, CTX-M is observed as the
most prevalent type throughout the world (Carattoli, 2013).

Food animals are one of the important sources of ESBL producing E.
coli in several countries in Europe (Cortés et al., 2010; Hille et al.,
2014) and Asia (GuoBao et al., 2009; Hiroi et al., 2012). Healthy pigs
among the food animals may play a major role in carriage of such
ESBL-producing organisms which can increase the chance of infection
in pig attendants, meat handlers as well as consumers of pork or pork
products in manifold (Boonyasiri et al., 2014; Hammerum et al.,
2014). A positive correlation was observed between ESBL-E. coli coloni-
zation and an Asian mother tongue with frequent consumption of meat
products specially the pork (ECDC, 2011).

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are intestinal pathotype of E.
coli producing heat stable (STa and STb) and heat labile (LT) toxins and
are associated with post weaning diarrhoea of piglets, traveller's diar-
rhoea, infant diarrhoea in human and neonatal watery diarrhoea in
other mammals (Samanta, 2013). The O-serogroups of E. coli such as
O8, O138, O139, O141, O147, O149 and O157 are considered as typical
ETEC serogroups commonly detected in pigs (Heo et al., 2013). The
presence of virulence genes (elt, estA/estI, estB/estII) encoding ETEC
toxins (LT, STa, STb) is the key requirements for the pathogenicity
(Wu et al., 2007). Commensal E. coli present in the gut of healthy pigs
may also harbour the virulence genes but do not produce infection in
their reservoirs due to lack of either correct virulence gene combina-
tions or their expressions in suitable environment (Chapman et al.,
2006). A positive linkage between antimicrobial resistance genes and
virulence genes (of ETEC) in commensal E. coli of the porcine gut was
detected (Travis et al., 2006). ETEC present in the gut may integrate
plasmid or mobile elements bearing ESBL genes which are poorly
investigated.

A few articles are available on detection of ESBL-E. coli from healthy
or diseased swine population in Asian countries such as China (Duan et
al., 2006; Hu et al., 2013), South Korea (Tamang et al., 2013) and Japan
(Asai et al., 2011). In India, mostly exotic breeds of pigs are reared by or-
ganized farming and indigenous or non-descript breeds are reared by
backyard farming and garbage belts (Banik et al., 2011). North-eastern
and eastern states such as West Bengal are considered as hub of pig in-
dustry. In these states the food habits are favourable for pork consump-
tion chieﬂy among the North-East inhabitants and Chinese people living
in West Bengal (Tiwari and Arora, 2005). Earlier we have reported the
occurrence of ESBL producing extraintestinal E. coli from bovine and
poultry in West Bengal which indicates that food animals from eastern
India are additional source of such infection (Kar et al., 2015;
Bandyopadhyay et al., 2015).

So, the present study was undertaken to investigate the occurrence
of ESBL/beta lactamase producing E. coli in healthy pigs with a compar-
ative characterization and clonal relationship of the strains isolated
from the organized and backyard farms in West Bengal, India.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Samples

farms (Ab, Bb, Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Hb, Ib, Jb; n = 10 each). The samples
were collected from less numbers of organized farms (n = 4) than back-
yard farms (n = 10) because numbers of organized piggery present in
the studied area was comparatively lower than the backyard farms.
The number of collected samples from each organized piggery was
higher because the average number of pigs maintained in an organized
piggery was comparatively higher than a backyard farm. The organized
farms were selected on the basis of production level whereas the back-
yard farms were selected by the local veterinarian based on convenient
location and willingness of the farmers to participate in the study. Some
of the farms (Ao, Bo, Co, Do and Ab, Bb, Cb, Db) were located in the ad-
jacent place in the same district whereas the other farms (Eb, Fb, Gb, Hb,
Ib, Jb) were located in a different district. The rectal swabs were collect-
ed from the pigs selected randomly from both types of farms.

The pigs of organized farms were 1–2 years old with history of anti-
biotic intake such as enroﬂoxacin and cephalosporins during their suf-
ferings. Incidentally the samples were collected after the antibiotic
exposure. The indigenous pigs belonged to 5–6 months of age and all
the studied backyard farms had no history of costly antibiotic intake
(e.g. cephalosporins) throughout the period the pigs were kept. Occa-
sionally the pigs were treated with tetracycline or gentamicin by local
veterinarian or paraveterinarians. The similarity in age group of pigs be-
tween two types of farms could not be maintained as indigenous pigs
were slaughtered or sold after attaining 6 months of age. The organized
piggeries kept the pigs in brick made pens with concrete ﬂoors and as-
bestos shed. The backyard pigs were kept in houses during night only
made of bamboo and jute-stick with earthen ﬂoors. The organized pig-
gery and backyard farm offered the feed and water in cement-casted
and earthen mangers, respectively. The pigs kept in backyard farms
roamed the surroundings during daytime.

The rectal swabs were collected with sterile cotton swab sticks
(HiMedia, India). The cotton swab sticks were directly put into sterile
vials containing Stuart medium (HiMedia, India) for transport. All the
samples collected were immediately brought into the laboratory main-
taining the cold chain for further examination.

2.2. Isolation and identiﬁcation of Escherichia coli

In the laboratory the samples were kept in the nutrient broth
(HiMedia, India) & incubated at 37 °C for overnight. It was transferred
to MacConkey's agar (HiMedia, India) and again incubated at 37 °C for
overnight. Next day rose pink colonies (one colony per sample) were
randomly picked and transferred to EMB agar (HiMedia, India) followed
by an overnight incubation at 37 °C. Colonies were observed for metallic
sheen and single colony was streaked into nutrient agar (HiMedia,
India) slant for further biochemical conﬁrmation. All the pure cultures
obtained from nutrient agar slant were subjected to Gram's staining
and standard biochemical tests as described earlier (Samanta et al.,
2014).

2.3. Serogrouping

All the Escherichia coli isolates after conﬁrmation by biochemical
tests were sent for O-serogrouping to Central Research Institute, Kasuli,
HP, India.

2.4. Antibiotic sensitivity of E. coli isolates

The rectal swabs (n = 200) were collected from apparently healthy
pigs of either sex kept in organized or backyard farm (n = 100 each) in
West Bengal (India) in 2012. The sample size was selected as per the
earlier report (Hering et al., 2014). The samples were collected from
four organized farms (Ao, Bo, Co, Do; n = 25 each) and 10 backyard

All the E. coli isolates were tested for their sensitivity and resistance
to different antibiotics by the disc diffusion method (CLSI, 2008). The
antibiotics used were amikacin (30 μg), chloramphenicol (10 μg),
enroﬂoxacin (5 μg), tetracycline (30 μg), co-trimoxazole (25 μg), genta-
micin (10 μg), ceftazidime (30 μg), ceftriaxone (30 μg), cefpodoxime
(10 μg), cefuroxime (30 μg), cefotaxime (30 μg) (Hi Media, India).

(ceftazidime,

spectrum cephalosporins

The E. coli isolates found resistant (100%) to one or more of the ex-
tended
ceftriaxone,
cefpodoxime, cefuroxime, cefotaxime) were further subjected to double
disc test for phenotypic conﬁrmation of ESBL (CTX-M/TEM/SHV) pro-
duction. Double disc test for detection of CTX-M production was carried
out in an agar plate with a disc containing cefotaxime (30 μg, HiMedia)
and a disc containing cefotaxime/clavulanate (30 μg/10 μg, HiMedia)
placed 30 mm apart (center to center) as described earlier (Brenwald
et al., 2003). Similarly for detection of TEM/SHV production double
disc test with ceftazidime (30 μg, HiMedia) and ceftazidime/clavulanate
(30 μg/10 μg, HiMedia) was carried out as described previously (Bedenic
et al., 2007).

2.6. Detection of ESBL genes (blaCTX-M, blaTEM, blaSHV) by PCR

The bacterial DNA was extracted from the E. coli isolates by the pre-
viously described method (Samanta et al., 2014). All the E. coli isolates
including controls were subjected to PCR for detection of blaCTX-M, blaTEM
and blaSHV genes using the primers and the cycle conditions as described
earlier (Table 1, Weill et al., 2004a, 2004b). The primers were procured
from Genetix Biotechnology Asia Private Limited. The PCR was carried
out in a 25 μl master mixture containing 2.5 μl DNA, 50 pmol of each
primers, 200 μM dNTPs, 1.25 U Taq polymerase, 2 mM MgCl2 (Genetix
Biotechnology Asia Private Limited). The ampliﬁed product was visual-
ized by gel documentation system (UVP, UK) after electrophoresis in 2%
(W/V) agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml) (SRL, India)
(Sambrook and Russel, 2001). The selected PCR products (one product
for each target gene) were sequenced from commercially available
sources (Xcelris Genomics, India). The sequence homology searches
were conducted using the BLAST algorithm (www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/
BLAST).

2.7. Detection of ETEC toxin genes by PCR

The genes encoding major ETEC toxins (LT, STa, STb) were detected
in all ESBL/beta-lactamase producing-E. coli isolates by PCR as per the
cycle conditions and primers described earlier (Bandyopadhyay et al.,
2011).

2.8. Characterization of ESBL/beta-lactamase producing-E. coli by RAPD-
PCR and clonal relationship

All the ESBL/beta-lactamase producing-E. coli isolates were charac-
terized by RAPD-PCR to detect the genetic diversity and clonal relation-
ship among the strains. The RAPD-PCR was performed in a thermocycler
(Eppendorf) using a single primer (OPB17: AGGGAACGAG, GCC Bio-
technology, India) as per the conditions described earlier (Lim et al.,
2009). The PCR products were then electrophoresed in 1.5% (w/v) aga-
rose gel containing ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/ml) (Sambrook and
Russel, 2001).

All the images taken by the gel documentation system (UVP, UK)
were analyzed using the Doc-itLs image analysis software supplied
with the system (UVP) as per manufacturer's instruction. An unrooted

2.9. Statistical analysis

Occurrence of ESBL/beta-lactamase producing-producing E. coli, as-
sociation of ETEC toxin genes and antibiotic resistance pattern in differ-
ent types of pig farms was compared by chi-square test using SPSS
software version 17.0 (SPSS Inc.).

3. Results and discussion

From the 200 rectal swabs of healthy pigs, 76 isolates were con-
ﬁrmed as E. coli of which 48 were from organized farms (48/100, 48%)
and 28 were from backyard sector (28/100, 28%) (Table 2). All the E.
coli isolates showed characteristic pink coloured colony in MacConkey
agar, metallic sheen in EMB agar, gram negative small rod appearance
in stained smear, and biochemically they were catalase (+ve), oxidase
(−ve), indole-methyl red-voges proskauer-citrate (+ + − −) and ure-
ase (−ve). Higher occurrence (97%) of E. coli was detected in healthy
pigs of organized farms in the Netherlands (Nijsten et al., 1996). In
north-eastern India, 100% occurrence of E. coli in both healthy and
diarrhoeic pigs was observed (Rajkhowa and Sarma, 2014). In the pres-
ent study, antibiotic exposure of the pigs kept in organized farms before
sample collection period and selection of single colony from each sam-
ple during isolation of E. coli are the probable causes of lower isolation
rate. The E. coli status in healthy backyard or indigenous pigs of India
is not available to compare the present ﬁnding. Former study has de-
scribed the collection of rectal swabs from both organized and indige-
nous pigs but categorically did not illustrate the number of E. coli
isolates obtained from both the sectors (Rajkhowa and Sarma, 2014).

From organized farm, E. coli isolates belonging to untypeable (UT)
serogroup was isolated with maximum frequency (22/48, 45.8%)
which was followed by rough (R) (6/48, 12.5%), O147 (4/48, 8.3%),
O60 (4/48, 8.3%), O8 (2/48, 4.1%), O11 (2/48, 4.1%), O13 (2/48, 4.1%),
O135 (2/48, 4.1%) and O166 (2/48, 4.1%) (Table 2). Whereas, from the
indigenous pigs, O55 (5/28, 17.8%), O133 (5/28, 17.8%) and untypeable
(UT) (5/28, 17.8%) were isolated most frequently which was followed
by O153 (3/28, 10.7%), O157 (3/28, 10.7%) and O158 (3/28, 10.7%)
(Table 2). The serogroups O5, O8, O147, UT and R were previously re-
ported in healthy and diarrhoeic pigs from India (Rajkhowa and
Sarma, 2014). Most of the enterotoxigenic E. coli of porcine origin
were reported from the serogroups O8, O147 and O157 (Nagy et al.,
1990; Harel et al., 1991). Higher occurrence (10.7%) of O157 in healthy
indigenous pigs has public health importance as it is also considered as a
major shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) serogroup causing hemor-
rhagic colitis (HC) and haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) in human
(Wani et al., 2004). In other countries also O157 was detected in faecal
samples or intestinal contents of slaughtered pigs but with a lower oc-
currence rate viz. 0.7%–2.7% (Heuvelink et al., 1999; Bonardi et al.,
2003). Earlier study in this part of India (West Bengal) detected higher
occurrence of O157 in calves (7.5%, Manna et al., 2006). Further, two of
the O157 isolates of the present study have both stx1 and stx2 (not eaeA
and ehxA) genes indicating their pathogenic potentiality. While till date
no human infection with O157 could be traced from pigs.

In the present study E. coli-isolates were screened for beta lactamase
producing strains. Twelve E. coli isolates (12/200, 6%) consisting of four
(4/100, 4%) from organized farm and eight from backyard farm (indig-
enous) pigs (8/100, 8%) were detected to possess any of the extended
spectrum beta lactamase or beta lactamase genes studied (Table 3).
Similar prevalence (5.7%) was detected in faecal samples from healthy
pigs in Portugal (Machado et al., 2008). Higher prevalence was observed
in faecal samples of healthy pigs kept in organized farms in Germany
(37%, von Salviati et al., 2014) and Portugal (49%, Ramos et al., 2013).
Lower occurrence (2%–3%) was observed in rectal swabs of healthy
pigs in Hong Kong and Japan (Duan et al., 2006; Hiroi et al., 2012). No
earlier report was apparently available regarding the prevalence in in-
digenous pigs to compare the ﬁnding. Analyzing the results linked to
farms revealed at least one ESBL/beta lactamase-E. coli was isolated
from two organized farms (50%, Table 3) and eight backyard farms
(80%, Table 3), respectively.

Majority of ESBL/beta lactamase producing-E. coli (6/200, 3%) iso-
lates were phenotypically conﬁrmed as CTX-M producers by double
disc test (cefotaxime and cefotaxime/clavulanate) and were detected
to possess blaCTX-M. The sequence of the PCR product was compared
and found 98% cognate with blaCTX-M-9 of E. coli from other reports.
The primer for bla CTX-M-9 was selected as the reports of CTX-M-9-E.
coli is not uncommon in healthy pigs (Escudero et al., 2010; Hansen et
al., 2013).

Similarly earlier studies in pigs detected CTX-M producing E. coli
with maximum frequency than other beta lactamase producing strains
(Corte´s et al., 2010; Ramos et al., 2013; Tamang et al., 2013). Previous
reports from other parts of the world indicated comparatively higher

prevalence of CTX-M-E. coli in healthy pigs such as in Switzerland
(15%, Geser et al., 2012), China (2–10%, GuoBao et al., 2009) and South
Korea (21%, Tamang et al., 2013) than the present ﬁnding (3%). Differ-
ences in geographical location, sampling pattern and other factors
could have inﬂuenced the occurrence rate in the present study.

Ten E. coli isolates were phenotypically conﬁrmed as TEM/SHV pro-
ducers in double disc test with ceftazidime and ceftazidime/clavulanate.
Among them only one isolate (1/48, 2%) from organized farm pigs was
detected to possess blaSHV and nine isolates (9/28, 32.1%) from the back-
yard pigs possessed both the blaSHV (5/28, 17.8%) and blaTEM (4/28,
14.2%) with or without bl CTX-M (Table 3). No predominant combination
of blaSHV and blaTEM with blaCTX-M was noted but presence of only blaSHV
was detected in three isolates (Table 3). Similarly, lower prevalence of
blaSHV and blaTEM was detected in organized pigs earlier (Ramos et al.,
2013; Bardoň et al., 2013). Additionally blaSHV alone was also detected
earlier in E. coli isolated from healthy pigs (Bardoň et al., 2013). Higher
association of blaTEM with blaCTX-M in organized farm pigs was detected
in former studies (Tamang et al., 2013; von Salviati et al., 2014) which
was not observed in the isolates of organized farm pigs. Nevertheless
the combination of blaTEM with blaCTX-M was detected in a single isolate
from the backyard pig in the present study. No unique combination of
the studied beta lactamase genes for organized and backyard farm pig
isolates was noted in the present study which is in line with the ﬁndings
of Valentin et al. (2014). The nucleotide sequences of the selected PCR
products (blaSHV and blaTEM) revealed 98% similarity with blaSHV-12
and blaTEM-1 in BLAST search. The primers were chosen due to associa-
tion of blaSHV-12 and blaTEM-1 producing E. coli with healthy pigs (Blanc
et al., 2006; Escudero et al., 2010; von Salviati et al., 2014). Our previous

Fig. 1. Phylogenetic analysis of ESBL/beta lactamase-E. coli strains isolated from healthy pigs in West Bengal (India). The neighbour-joining method was used to summarize the similarity of
RAPD-PCR proﬁles of ESBL/beta lactamase-E. coli strains in a dendogram.

studies have also reported presence of blaSHV-12 and blaTEM-1 producing
in cattle and poultry in this region (Kar et al., 2015;
E. coli
Bandyopadhyay et al., 2015).

Comparative assessment revealed that the occurrence of ESBL/beta-
lactamase producing-E. coli was signiﬁcantly higher in indigenous pigs
(8/28, 28.5%) than the organized farm pigs (4/48, 8.3%) (p = 0.026).
This could not be related to the use of antibiotics as no history of costly
antibiotic (cephalosporins) use was known in indigenous pigs. Overuse
of antibiotic and emergence of resistant E. coli strains is not always pos-
itively correlated (Singer et al., 2008). No strong association could be de-
tected between the prevalence of ceftriaxone resistant E. coli and use of
ceftiofur (Tragesser et al., 2006). Probably the contaminated environ-
ment could be the source of ESBL/beta-lactamase-producing E. coli in
the present study. The indigenous pigs roamed the surroundings during
daytime and were more exposed to the contaminated environment.
Previously, von Salviati et al. (2014) reported that the environment in-
cluding the watering places might be the sources of ESBL/AmpC-E. coli
infection in the pig farms. Another factor is the age group of indigenous
pigs (5–6.5 months) which might enhance the shedding of ESBL-E. coli
as detected in earlier study (Hansen et al., 2013).

The ESBL/beta-lactamase producing-E coli isolated from the studied
pigs belonged to O13, O55, O133, O153, O157, O158, O166, rough and
untypeable (UT) serogroups (Table 3). Among the serogroups isolated,
untypeable was detected with maximum frequency (4/12, 33.3%) as
ESBL/beta-lactamase producers. Similarly Mandakini et al. (2015) re-
ported the highest frequency of UT (11/43, 25.5%) followed by O26 (8/
43, 18.6%) in ESBL-E. coli isolated from diarrhoeic pigs in India.

All the ESBL/beta-lactamase-E. coli isolated from organized farm pigs
(4) possessed elt (4/4, 100%) genes of ETEC and all the ESBL/beta-
lactamase producing isolates from indigenous pigs possessed estA (6/
8, 75%) and estB (2/8, 25%) (Table 3). The association of elt (p b
0.0005) with organized farm isolates and estA (p = 0.0143) with back-
yard piggery sector was signiﬁcantly higher. Such positive correlation of
antimicrobial resistance and toxin genes of E. coli was reported previ-
ously (Travis et al., 2006). Thus antimicrobial resistance generated in
an E. coli strain can co-select virulence genes making the condition
more severe. Furthermore, the heat stable toxin (ST) was more fre-
quently associated with porcine and early childhood diarrhoea
(Fairrbother et al., 1989; Shaheen et al., 2004). The indigenous pigs in
the present study act as major public health threat due to more associ-
ation of ESBL/beta-lactamase producing-E. coli along with STa.

The ESBL/beta-lactamase producing-E. coli isolates from organized
farm (Ak/Ex) and indigenous pigs (Ak/Ex/Te and Ak/CoT/G) showed a
typical antibiotic resistance pattern although the statistical correlation
could not be ascertained due to lower numbers of isolates (Table 3).
Similarly, Valentin et al. (2014) observed a common phenotypical anti-
biotic resistance pattern of ESBL-E. coli isolates [blaCTX-M-15 RRR

(resistant for gentamicin, chloramphenicol and sulfamethoxazole/tri-
methoprim)] in pigs and human.

Comparative analysis of the E. coli isolates other than ESBL/beta-
lactamase producers (64) from the organized and backyard farm pigs
revealed that isolates of backyard pigs were signiﬁcantly more resistant
against chloramphenicol (p b 0.0001), amikacin (p b 0.0001), co-
trimoxazole (p b 0.0001), enroﬂoxacin (p = 0.0006), tetracycline
(p = 0.0018) and gentamicin (p = 0.0032) than the isolates of orga-
nized farm pigs. E. coli isolates from pigs were found resistant to oxytet-
racycline (83.5%), ﬂuroquinolone (61.9%), aminoglycosides (34%) and
chloramphenicol in different studies (Nijsten et al., 1996; Sunde et al.,
1998; Geser et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2013). Resistance to chloramphenicol
is noteworthy due to its restricted use in pig industry. Earlier study has
detected maintenance of chloramphenicol resistance in porcine E. coli
isolates even in absence of selection pressure due to linkage of chloram-
phenicol resistance gene with other antibiotics used in pig industry
(Bischoff et al., 2005). Such kind of linkage though was not evaluated
in the present study. Furthermore, no study with organized farm and in-
digenous pigs was apparently available to compare the present ﬁnding.
All ESBL/beta-lactamase producing-E. coli strains (12) were charac-
terized by RAPD-PCR to determine the genetic diversity among the
strains. The majority of the strains (11) were typeable with primer
OPB17 and they produced 11 different patterns. Two pairs of isolates
each from organized and backyard pig farm (HP/C/9/A and PMM/3A,
2D and 3D in Fig. 1 and HP/C/5/C and PGG/4B, 2A and 2E in Fig. 1)
were detected in the same cluster indicating their clonal relationship.
All the four isolates belonged to untypeable (UT) serogroup, however,
no other similarity in bla proﬁle, virulence gene proﬁle and phenotypi-
cal antibiotic resistance pattern was detected (Table 3). Further, all of
them were isolated from the organized (Ao, Co, Table 3) and backyard
farms (Bb, Db, Table 3) situated in the adjacent area. The RAPD based
clonal relationship between them suggests the possibility of transmis-
sion between indigenous pigs and organized farms as observed earlier
between the patients in human hospitals (Lim et al., 2009).

The present study detected comparative higher carriage of ESBL/
beta-lactamase producing-E. coli in backyard farm (indigenous) pigs
than the organized farm pigs. Many of the ESBL producers carried
ETEC toxin genes. Isolation of O157 serogroup and association of STa
with the E. coli isolates from backyard farm (indigenous) pigs make
them a potential public health hazard. Clonal relationship between the
ESBL/beta-lactamase producers of backyard and organized farm pigs
and adjacent location of the farms suggests a cross transmission be-
tween them.
