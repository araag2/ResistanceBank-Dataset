Abstract 

 

The increasing presence of ESBL-producing bacteria in  food-producing animals might 

impact on public health. In this study, ESBL-producing enterobacteria were investigated 

in the microbiota of chickens produced in Brazil. We detected blaCTX-M-2, blaCTX-M-8 and 

blaCTX-M-15 in  13 Escherichia coli isolates,  within 9 different  PFGE-types.  Escherichia 

fergusonii  and  Klebsiella  pneumoniae  were  found  carrying  blaCTX-M-2.  Plasmid  Inc 

groups  found  included  repF,  FIB,  FIC,  I1,  Y,  B/O,  A/C,  K  and  HI1.  F  plasmids  were 

present  in  87.5%  of  the  isolates,  however,  no  resistance  gene  was  harbored  in  this 

replicon. The pMLST for IncI1 showed ST113 and the novel ST130, ST131 and ST132 

harboring  blaCTX-M-8.  IncK  plasmids  carried  blaCTX-M-2  in  one  E.  coli  isolate.  Non-

typeable  plasmids  carrying  blaCTX-M-2  or  blaCTX-M-15  had  up  to  260kb.  blaCTX-M-2  was 

also  associated  with  class  I  integron  and  ISCR1  and  blaCTX-M-8  with  IS10.  Overall, 

similar  resistance  elements  were  disseminated  among  a  diverse  population  of  ESBL-

producing enterobacteria.

1. 

 

Introduction 

Extended-spectrum  β-lactamase  (ESBL)-producing  Enterobacteriaceae  are  a 

concern for contemporary public health worldwide. These bacteria have been identified 

with  increased  prevalence  in  the  community  and  are  associated  with  mortality  in 

hospitals (Hawkey, 2015). An increasing number of studies report resistance genes and 

ESBL-producing enterobacteria in food-producing animals, especially poultry (Liebana, 

et al., 2013). 

 

Many ESBL-producing enterobacteria carry other resistance genes associated in 

the  same  ESBL-carrying  plasmid.  In  such  cases  the  use  of  antimicrobial  agents,  other 

than  cephalosporins,  can  contribute  for  the  maintenance  and  dissemination  of  ESBL 

encoding-genes  (Persoons,  et  al.,  2011).  The  wide  prevalence  of  resistance  genes  in 

food-producing  animals  occurs  essentially  for  two  reasons,  the  selection  of  resistant 

isolates  by  indiscriminate  use  of  antimicrobial  agents  in  the  fields  and  presence  of 

mobile  genetic  elements  (MGE)  disseminating  resistance  genes  to  different  bacterial 

hosts (Liebana, et al., 2013). 

 

Currently,  studies  involving  ESBL-producing  E.  coli  isolated  from  poultry  and 

from  humans  have  demonstrated  similar  characteristics  shared  among  isolates, 

especially  those related to  MGEs, which are closely  related  among  animal  and  human 

isolates. These studies have also suggested  that the spread of resistant isolates through 

the food chain may contribute for the increasing number of infections or colonization by 

ESBL-producing E. coli in humans (Carattoli, 2013; Kluytmans, et al., 2013). 

 

The  main  mechanism  of  dissemination  and  acquisition  of  antimicrobial 

resistance genes in Enterobacteriaceae has been attributed to the horizontal transfer of 

MGE, especially plasmids carrying these genes, hindering the efficacy of treatments for 

infections caused by ESBL-producers (Carattoli, 2013).

Thus, the present study assessed the presence of β-lactamase-encoding genes and 

evaluated  the  population  structure  of  resistant  enterobacteria  isolated  from  apparently 

healthy broiler chickens. The genetic relationship among ESBL-producing isolates was 

compared  within  different  farms  to  evaluate  the  occurrence  of  clonal  dissemination  in 

the fields. Moreover, the study aimed to characterize plasmids carrying ESBL genes to 

investigate  the  MGE  such  as  integrons  and  insertion  elements  that  may  facilitate  the 

maintenance  of  resistance  genes  and  exchange  of  genetic  material  in  the  animal 

environment.

Material and methods 

2.1. 

Isolates 

 

From  2011  to  2012,  two-hundred  cloacal  swabs  were  harvested  from  40  days-

old  commercial  broilers  in  two  poultry  farms  (1  and  2  with  distance  around  250Km 

between  their)  from  São  Paulo  State,  Brazil  (100  swabs  per  farm).  Cloacal  swab 

samples were streaked on MacConkey (MC) agar containing cefotaxime (1µg/mL) and 

on  MC  agar  with  ceftazidime  (1µg/mL),  incubated  at  37°C  for  24h.  One  colony  per 

plate  was  selected  to  conduct  the  present  study.  The  bacterial  colonies  were  identified 

by  classical  biochemical  methods  and  confirmed  by  API  20E  system  (bioMérieux, 

France). 

 

2.2.  Antimicrobial susceptibility testing  

 

The  antimicrobial  susceptibility  of  the  isolates  were  determined  by  using  the 

disk  diffusion  methods  (CLSI,  2012),  and  the  results  were  interpreted  according  to 

recommendations  of  the  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards  Institute  (CLSI)  2013, 

document  M100-S23.  Fifteen  antimicrobial  agents  were  tested,  including  β-lactam 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT5 

 

antibiotics:  amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid 

(AMC),  piperacillin/tazobactam 

(TZP), 

cefotaxime  (CTX),  ceftazidime  (CAZ),  cefoxitin  (FOX),  cefepime  (FEP),  aztreonam 

(ATM),  ertapenem  (ETP)  and  non  β-lactam  antibiotics:  nalidixic  acid  (NAL), 

ciprofloxacin  (CIP),  levofloxacin  (LEV),  tetracycline  (TET),  gentamicin  (GEN), 

trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  (SXT)  and  chloramphenicol  (CHL).  ESBL-producing 

isolates  were  screened  by  double  disk  synergism  (DDS)  using  cefotaxime  and 

ceftazidime plus amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (Jarlier, et al., 1988). 

 

2.3.  Determination of population structure 

 

Genetic  relationship  among  isolates  was  determined  by  analysis  of  XbaI-

digested genomic DNA on pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), performed in CHEF 

DRIII System (Bio-Rad, USA) (CDC, 2004). Gels were analyzed with the BioNumerics 

fingerprinting  software  (Applied  Maths,  Belgium)  and  the  normalized  profiles  were 

compared  using  the  Dice  similarity  index.  The  dendrogram  was  constructed  using  the 

unweighted-pair  group  method  using  average  linkage  algorithm  (UPGMA).  The 

homology  cutoff  value  of  85%  was  used  to  group  the  related  isolates  within  the  same 

PFGE-type. 

 

The determination of phylogenetic groups was assigned according to previously 

described  method  (Clermont,  et  al.,  2000).  Briefly,  this  method  designates  one  out  of 

four phylogenetic groups (A, B1, B2, or D) to each E. coli isolate based on the presence 

of chuA, yjaA genes and TSPE4.C2 DNA fragment. 

 

2.4.  Detection of β-lactamase genes  

 

The investigation of blaCTX-M (groups 1, 2, 9, 8 and 25) was carried out by PCR 

(Saladin, et  al.,  2002). Purified PCR  amplicons (illustra™ GFX™ PCR DNA and Gel 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

Band  Purification  Kit,  GE  Healthcare,  USA)  were  directly  sequenced  using  the  ABI 

3730 DNA Analyser (Life Technologies-Applied Biosystems). The DNA sequences and 

translated  amino acid  sequences  obtained were compared  with  references found in  the 

6 

LAHEY home page (http://www.lahey.org/Studies/). 

 

2.5.  Genetic environment of β-lactamase genes  

 

The  genetic  environment  of  β-lactamase  genes  was  determined  by  PCR  of 

upstream  and  downstream  regions,  as  described  previously  (Dhanji,  et  al.,  2010). 

Briefly  if  ISCR1  was  found  upstream  or  downstream  of  β-lactamase  genes,  two 

additional PCRs were performed using the Long PCR Enzyme Mix (Thermo-Scientific, 

USA) with forward primers Sul1-F (5’GCC CTG TCC GAT CAG ATG CA 3’) or Int1-

F (5′-TCC AGAACC TTG ACC GAA CG-3′) combined with a reverse primer for the 

β-lactamase genes to search for class 1 integron structures (Dhanji, et al., 2010). 

 

2.6.  PCR-based Replicon Typing (PBRT) and resistance gene location 

 

After  identification  of  β-lactamase  genes  in  resistant  isolates  by  PCR  and 

confirmation by sequencing, plasmids were investigated and characterized by the PBRT 

scheme,  as  previously  described  (Carattoli,  et  al.,  2005).  Southern  blot  and 

hybridization  methods  were  performed  to  locate  the  replicon  type  carrying  the  ESBL-

encoding  gene.  Briefly,  plasmid DNA  was  digested with  S1 nuclease  and analyzed on 

PFGE  gels  (S1-PFGE).  The  PFGE  gel  was  submitted  to  a  southern  blot  in  the  nylon 

membrane  (Hybond-N+,  GE  Healthcare  Life  Sciences,  USA)  and  hybridization  with 

specific probes for detection of the resistance gene and the incompatibility (Inc) groups. 

The identification of the replicon type harboring the resistance gene was determined by 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

binding  of  probes  for  resistance  gene  in  the  same  position  of  the  replicon  in  the 

7 

membrane. 

 

2.7.  Conjugation experiments 

 

Transferability  of  plasmids  carrying  β-lactamase  genes  was  determined  by 

conjugation  with  recipient  Escherichia  coli  strains  assisted  by  antimicrobial  resistance 

markers  and  lactose  fermentation  characteristics  of  the  recipient  strain.  The  lactose 

positive  transconjugants  obtained  in  azide-resistant  E.  coli  J53  were  selected  on 

MacConkey  agar  containing  2  µg/mL  of  cefotaxime  and  100  µg/mL  of  sodium  azide 

and  the  lactose  negative  obtained  in  streptomycin-resistant  E.  coli  C600 were  selected 

with  300  µg/mL  of  streptomycin.  The  presence  of  β-lactamase  genes  in  the 

transconjugants  was  confirmed  by  PCR.  Inc  groups  of  the  resistance  plasmids  from 

transconjugants  were  assigned  using  the  PBRT  method,  as  previously  described 

(Carattoli, et al., 2005). 

 

2.8.  Plasmid multilocus sequence typing (pMLST) 

The primers  and PCR  conditions  for the  pMLST of  IncI  plasmids followed the 

instructions  described  in  http://pubmlst.org/plasmid/primers/.  The  amplicons  were 

purified  with  illustra™  GFX™  PCR  DNA  and  Gel  Band  Purification  Kit  (GE 

Healthcare, USA) and both strands were sequenced using an ABI 3730 DNA Analyser 

(Life Technologies-Applied Biosystems, USA). The nucleotide sequences were aligned 

using  ChromasPro  Software  version  1.41  (Technelysium,  Australia).  The  allele  types 

were analyzed in the database at http://www.pubmlst.org/plasmid/.

RESULTS 

3.1.  Antimicrobial susceptibility 

 

Among 

the  studied 

isolates,  DDS 

test  detected  16  ESBL-producing 

enterobacteria  isolates  (8%),  which  were  13  E.  coli,  2  Escherichia  fergusonii  and  1 

Klebsiella  pneumoniae.  The  ESBL-producing  isolates  showed  resistance  to  most  β-

lactam antibiotics tested  (resistance to  broad-spectrum  cephalosporins and aztreonam), 

remaining susceptible only to carbapenens (ETP) (Table 1). Co-resistance phenotypes to 

non  β-lactam  antibiotics  were  also  observed,  including  to  GEN  (6/16),  SXT  (5/16), 

CHL  (3/16),  TET  (15/16)  and  to  quinolones  NAL  (15/16),  CIP  (15/16)  and  LEV 

(14/16).  The  16  ESBL-producing  isolates  were  multidrug-resistant  (MDR),  which  are 

not  susceptible  to  at  least  one  agent  in  three  or  more  antimicrobial  categories 

(Magiorakos, et al., 2012). 

 

3.2.  Characterization of β-lactamase genes and genetic environment 

Investigation of β-lactamase  groups by PCR revealed 16 isolates (8%) carrying 

blaCTX-M  type  gene.  The  16  CTX-M-producing  isolates  consisted  of  9  E.  coli  isolates 

carrying  blaCTX-M-8,  3  carrying  blaCTX-M-2  and  1  carrying  blaCTX-M-15  and  also  2  E. 

fergusonii and 1 K. pneumoniae isolate carrying blaCTX-M-2. The CTX-M-2-producing E. 

fergusonii and E. coli and the CTX-M-15-producing E. coli were isolated in farm 1, the 

CTX-M-2-producing  K.  pneumoniae  was  isolated  in  farm  2,  whilst  CTX-M-8-

producing E. coli isolates were found on both farms (Table 1). 

The  genetic  environment  characterized  in  CTX-M-producing  isolates  showed 

the  insertion  sequence  ISCR1  and  a  class  1  integron  structure  with  7kb  upstream  (5’ 

region) from the resistance genes in 6 blaCTX-M-2 isolates (3 E. coli, 2 E. fergusonii and 1 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

K.  pneumoniae).  The  IS10  was  found  upstream  from  blaCTX-M-8  in  8  E.  coli  isolates 

9 

(Table 1). 

 

3.3.  Clonal analysis by PFGE and phylogroup determination 

 

Clonal  diversity  was  showed  among  13  E.  coli  isolates,  classified  in  9  PFGE-

types.  The  2  E.  fergusonii  isolates  belonged  to  the  same  PFGE-type  with  100% 

similarity. There were no common clones shared among farms studied (Figure 1). 

 

The phylogenetic groups A, B1, and D were found among E. coli isolates. Seven 

isolates belonged to the  phylogenetic  group A, four were assigned to  the phylogenetic 

group  D  and  two  isolates  belonged  to  phylogenetic  group  B1.  Phylogenetic  group  B2 

was not found (Table 1). 

 

3.4.  Characterization of replicon types, hybridization and conjugation 

 

A wide variety of plasmids replicons were identified from groups IncF (14 F, 11 

FIB,  1  FIC),  IncI1  (13),  IncY(4),  and  one  from  each  group  A/C,  K  and  HI1. 

Furthermore,  the  southern  blot  and  hybridization  showed  9  E.  coli  isolates  harbored 

blaCTX-M-8 gene in plasmids IncI1 with approximately 50kb. One E. coli isolate (MA41) 

showed  blaCTX-M-2  harbored  in  the  IncK  plasmid  (35kb).  K.  pneumoniae  and  E. 

fergusonii  isolates  harbored  blaCTX-M-2  gene  in  plasmids  that  were  not  typeable  by 

PBRT,  yet  the  hybridization  identified  the  resistance  plasmids  with  long  lengths  with 

250kb  and  260kb,  respectively  (Table  1).  The  resistance  genes  and  replicon  types 

associated  identified  by  hybridization  were  subsequently  confirmed  by  PCR  using  the 

transconjugants obtained. E. coli isolates resulted in transconjugants with E. coli C600 

and  E.  fergusonii  isolates  with  E.  coli  J53.  The  replicons  carrying  the  resistance  gene 

are underlined in Table 1. The E. coli isolates MA86, MA93 and K. pneumoniae did not 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

result  in  transconjugants  with  the  recipient  strain  E.  coli  C600,  however  the 

hybridization showed that the resistance genes were harbored in large plasmids ranging 

10 

from 200kb to 260kb, not typeable by PBRT. 

 

3.5. 

pMLST 

 

The  pMLST  for  IncI1  plasmid  replicons  was  performed  with  transconjugants 

and  identified  ST113  (allelic  profile  1/2/5/10/10).  Furthermore,  three  novel  STs  were 

identified  in  the  present  work  and  deposited  in  the  pMLST  database  as  ST130  (allelic 

profile  1/2/8/10/19),  ST131  (allelic  profile  1/9/23/4/3)  and  ST132  (allelic  profile 

1/2/23/4/3) (Table 1).

Discussion 

Antimicrobial  resistance  in  commensal  and  pathogenic  enterobacteria  causes 

high impact  on public health. Animal reservoirs  may be involved in  the  dissemination 

of  resistant  bacteria,  which  may  occur  by  contact  with  animals,  contaminated  food  of 

animal origin, raw meat, water and environment. Plasmids carrying resistance genes in 

commensal  E.  coli  were  shown  to  be  successfully  transferred  in  vivo  to  pathogenic 

bacteria,  including  Salmonella  (Canton,  et  al.,  2011).  Considering  the  use  of 

antimicrobial  agents  in  production  animals,  we  investigated  resistance  genes  in 

commensal  enterobacteria 

isolated 

from  broiler  chickens, 

furthermore 

the 

epidemiological features were deeply analyzed to elucidate the mechanisms involved in 

the dissemination of the resistance genes. 

In the present work, ESBL-producing E. coli, E. fergusonii and K. pneumoniae 

were  isolated  from  the  intestinal  microbiota  of  apparently  healthy  broilers.  Among  16 

ESBL-producing  isolates,  93.75%  (15/16)  were  also  resistant  to  NAL,  CIP  and  TET; 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT11 

 

87.5% (14/16) were also resistant to LEV; 37.5% (6/16) were also resistant to GEN and 

31.25% (5/16)  were  also  resistant to  SXT. As noticed, a high level  of co-resistance to 

quinolones  and  fluoroquinolones  were  showed  in  the  ESBL-producing  isolates. 

Together  with  β-lactams,  these  important  classes  of  antimicrobial  agents  are  the  first 

choice  for  treatments  of  infections  caused  by  enterobacteria.  Considering  that  all  16 

ESBL-producing  isolates  were  MDR,  the  frequent  usage  of  these  antimicrobial  agents 

acts as selective pressure on these bacteria contributing to increase its prevalence in the 

environment  (Canton,  et  al.,  2011)  and  to  the  successful  colonization  of  the  poultry 

intestinal tract.  

Total prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli isolates in different animal species 

and  meat  in  2009  ranged  from  2%  to  9%,  depending  on  the  source,  according  to  the 

European  Food  Safety  Authority  (Liebana,  et  al.,  2013).  In  the  present  study,  the 

prevalence of ESBL-producing enterobacteria was 8%. Currently in Brazil, one-day old 

chicks  may  receive 

third-generation  cephalosporin 

to  prevent  omphalitis  and 

gastrointestinal  infections,  which  may  contribute  to  select  resistant  microbiota  and 

consequently increase the reservoirs of MDR enterobacteria in the animal environment 

(Collignon,  et  al.,  2013),  as  noticed  in  the  present  study.  In  2012,  the  Food  and  Drug 

Administration (FDA) in United States approved a novel legislation  restricting the use 

of cephalosporins in food-producing animals, including chickens, aiming to reduce the 

prophylactic use of antimicrobial drugs in animal production and also the dissemination 

of resistant bacteria (US Food and Drug Administration, 2012).  

CTX-M-producing enterobacteria are widespread among human populations but 

an increasing number of reports describes the presence in the animal environment and in 

food  of  animal  origin  (Lazarus,  et  al.,  2015).  Our  findings  show  that  the  poultry  is  a 

reservoir  of  resistance  genes  blaCTX-M-2,  blaCTX-M-8  and  blaCTX-M-15  in  enterobacteria 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT12 

 

isolated  from  the  intestinal  tract.  As  shown  in  Table  1,  a  wide  genetic  diversity  was 

found among all ESBL isolates, classified among different PFGE-types.  

CTX-M-2 

is 

the  dominant  ESBL  group 

among  human 

clinical 

Enterobacteriaceae isolates in South America (Minarini, et al., 2009). The gene blaCTX-

M-2 was found in 37.5% ESBL isolates, from three different Enterobacteriaceae species. 

All  E.  coli,  E.  fergusonii  and  K.  pneumoniae  carrying  blaCTX-M-2,  shared  in  common  a 

class  1  integron  and  ISCR1  associated  with  the  resistance  gene,  suggesting  that  both 

these MGE may have been disseminated in the farms, transferring the resistance gene to 

different plasmids. Moreover, the same MGE carrying the resistance gene were found in 

a  polyclonal  bacterial  population,  E.  coli  from  different  PFGE-types  and  2  different 

species.  ISCR1  was  previously  attributed  to  the  mobilization  of  resistance  genes  (e.g. 

blaCTX-M-2)  into  plasmids,  consequently  increasing  the  dissemination  of  antimicrobial 

resistance  mechanisms  (Toleman,  et  al.,  2006).  Similar  to  the  present  work,  class  1 

integron-ISCR1  complex  was  found  associated  to  blaCTX-M-2  in  Argentina  (Arduino,  et 

al.,  2003).  The  association  of  blaCTX-M  genes  with  class  1  integron  and  ISCR1  may 

contribute to increase the mobility of the resistance gene and  recombination with other 

plasmid Inc groups in different bacterial hosts, and also increases the risk of insertions 

into  bacterial  chromosome,  as  previously  shown  (Ferreira,  et  al.,  2014).  Therefore, 

given  the  non-clonal  nature  of  the  disseminated  resistant  isolates  in  the  studied  farms, 

plasmids  and  other  MGE  may  be  involved.  Thus  not  only  clonal  dissemination  by 

selection  of  a  single  resistant  isolate  should  be  considered  for  the  antimicrobial 

resistance dissemination (Canton, et al., 2006) in the animal environment. 

The  CTX-M-8  enzyme  was  first  described  in  the  year  2000  from  clinical 

isolates, in Brazil (Bonnet, et al., 2000). However, it has also been identified in Europe 

and  USA  since  then,  but  the  prevalence  is  still  low  in  other  territories  (Eller,  et  al., 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT13 

 

2013). Our findings show that blaCTX-M-8 was found in higher prevalence (56%) among 

the  ESBL  isolates  from  animal  source.  This  resistance  gene  was  found  in  9  E.  coli 

isolates from farms 1 and 2, however these were classified into 6 different PFGE-types 

(A, D, E, H, L and one was not determined). The in-depth plasmid analysis showed that 

blaCTX-M-8  was  harbored  in  IncI1  plasmids  with  similar  sizes  (50kb)  and  the  insertion 

element  IS10  was  associated  with  the  resistance  gene  in  all  isolates  except  in  MA32. 

Despite similarities, the pMLST revealed four different STs, including three novel STs 

(130,  131  and  132)  among  these  plasmids.  The  variable  genotypes  and  phenotypes  of 

the  resistant  E.  coli  isolates  found  in  the  present  study  demonstrates  the  rich  genetic 

diversity involved in the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes. This diversity 

may  be  a  consequence  of  the  polyclonal  E.  coli  populations  present  in  the  intestinal 

microbiota. 

CTX-M-15  is  one  of  the  most  common  ESBL  detected  worldwide,  in  human 

clinical infections by different  pathogens. In Brazil, this enzyme was described for the 

first time in 2010, found in clinical isolates from hospitalized patients (Cergole-Novella, 

et al., 2010). In 2008, a study evaluated the presence of resistant bacteria in raw chicken 

meat from the UK and other countries, including Brazil, but E. coli carrying blaCTX-M-15 

were  not  found.  Only  in  2015,  CTX-M-15  producing  E.  coli  was  isolated  for  the  first 

time  in  Brazil  from  frozen  chicken  carcasses  (Botelho,  et  al.,  2015).  However,  in  the 

present  study  we  characterized  blaCTX-M-15  in  one  E.  coli  isolate  from  live  healthy 

poultry in Brazil for the first time, which might consequently be transferred to carcasses 

and in natura meat. Our results corroborate with the current literature, and show the risk 

of dissemination of resistance genes and bacteria  present in livestock through the food 

chain.  In fact, this gene has  also been  recently  described in food-producing animals in 

other countries (Kang, et al., 2013).

Eleven  different  Inc  groups  of  plasmids  were  found  among  the  isolates, 

including  IncI1  and  IncK.  The  IncI1  plasmid  family  is  frequently  associated  with 

resistance  genes (Carattoli, 2013). The pMLST database up-to-date has more than 320 

STs, among these, 191 belong to IncI1 profile. In this study, the blaCTX-M-8 was present 

in  IncI1  plasmids,  within  4  different  STs,  from  which  three  (ST  130,  ST  131  and  ST 

132) were identified for the first time. IncI1 plasmid family was also described in UK, 

carrying blaCTX-M-8 in isolates from raw chicken imported from South America (Dhanji, 

et  al.,  2010).  These  plasmids  (IncI1)  were  highly  disseminated  during  the  last  decade 

and previous study hypothesize the presence in animal reservoirs (Leverstein-van Hall, 

et al., 2011), which was confirmed by the present study. IncK plasmids were associated 

to  the  dissemination  of  CTX-M  in  the  UK,  in  animals,  humans  and  environment 

(Cottell, et al., 2011). In the United States these plasmids were identified in multidrug-

resistant E. coli isolated from chickens (Lindsey, et al., 2011). 

 

Few  reports  show  E.  fergusonii  or  K.  pneumoniae  carrying  resistance  genes  in 

farm  animals.  Resistant  and enterotoxigenic  E. fergusonii were isolated  from chickens 

in  South  Korea  and  India  (Oh,  et  al.,  2012).  In  Japan,  CTX-M-2-producing  K. 

pneumoniae  was  identified  in  broiler  chickens  (Hiroi,  et  al.,  2012).  Although  E. 

fergusonii  may  be  present  in  the  intestinal  tract  as  commensal  microbiota,  different 

reports  suggest  a  high  pathogenic  potential,  describing  many  virulence  factors, 

associated  to  multidrug  resistance  in  these  bacteria.  Considering  the  capacity  to  cause 

disease  in  both  humans  and  animals  E.  fergusonii  may  emerge  as  a  novel  concern  for 

public health (Forgetta, et al., 2012). In the present work we found MDR E. fergusonii 

carrying  blaCTX-M-2  in  a  large  plasmid  (260kb),  contributing  to  better  understand 

resistance to antimicrobial agents in this species, which still has few data in the current 

literature (Gaastra, et al., 2014). Despite not being typeable by PBRT, this large plasmid 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT15 

 

harbored the class I integron and ISCR1 associated with the resistance gene, increasing 

the risks of mobility and recombination with other plasmids. 

The  presence  of  CTX-M-producing  enterobacteria  in  food  producing  animals 

and raw food products was suggested as potential source of dissemination of resistance 

genes  worldwide  (Dhanji,  et  al.,  2010;  Eller,  et  al.,  2013).  Furthermore,  similarities 

between  ESBL-producing  E.  coli  isolated  from  chickens  and  humans  have  been 

described,  particularly  the  MGEs  that  carries  the  resistance  genes  (Kluytmans,  et  al., 

2013).  ESBLs  from  groups  CTX-M-2  and  CTX-M-8  were  previously  identified  in  E. 

coli isolated from raw chicken meat imported from South America to the UK (Dhanji, et 

al.,  2010)  and  more  recently,  in  enterobacteria  isolated  from  retail  chicken  meat 

collected in marketplace from Brazil (Casella, et al., 2015).  

In  conclusion  we  showed  the  presence  of  ESBL  encoding-genes  in  commensal 

enterobacteria  isolated  from  live  chickens  from  Brazil  and  found  different  plasmids 

carrying  ESBL  genes  (blaCTX-M-2,  blaCTX-M-8  and  blaCTX-M-15).  The  epidemiological 

evaluation  showed  that  the  plasmids  size  carrying  resistance  genes  were  diverse, 

ranging from 35 to 260kb. Despite the large size of the plasmids, some of these showed 

to  be  conjugative  and  were  present  in  different  populations  of  E.  coli  and  also  E. 

fergusonii  and  K.  pneumoniae.  Furthermore,  ISCR1  or  IS10  were  detected  in 

association  with  resistance  genes.  The  IncI  plasmids  carrying  blaCTX-M-8  were  highly 

similar  and  had  the  same  size  (50kb),  however  the  pMLST  analysis  revealed  that  4 

different  plasmids  acquired  the  same  resistance  gene.  These  evidences  support  the 

increasing  public  health  concern  considering  the  dissemination  of  resistance  genes 

through the food chain and animal environment.
