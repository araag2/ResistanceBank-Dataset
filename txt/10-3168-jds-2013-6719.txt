  ABSTRACT 

  Mastitis is an important disease for the dairy indus-
try  worldwide,  causing  economic  losses  and  reducing 
milk quality and production. Staphylococcus aureus is a 
worldwide agent of this intramammary infection, which 
also  causes  foodborne  diseases.  The  objective  of  this 
study  was  to  determine  the  frequency  of  methicillin-
susceptible  Staphylococcus  aureus  (MSSA)  isolates 
in milk of mastitis cows in Brazil and to analyze the 
genetic lineages and the content of antimicrobial resis-
tance genes and virulence factors among these isolates. 
Fifty-six MSSA isolates were recovered from 1,484 milk 
samples  (positive  for  the  California  mastitis  test)  of 
518 cows from 11 different farms in Brazil (representing 
51%  of  total  Staph.  aureus  obtained),  and  they  were 
further  characterized.  Methicillin-susceptible  Staphy-
lococcus  aureus  were  isolated  from  3.7%  of  California 
mastitis  test-positive  tested  milk  samples  and  from 
6.2%  of  tested  mastitic  cows.  Methicillin-susceptible 
Staphylococcus  aureus  isolates  were  characterized  by 
spa typing, agr typing, and multilocus sequence typing, 
and  resistance  and  virulence  traits  were  investigated 
by PCR. Seven spa types were identified among MSSA 
(%  of  isolates):  t127  (44.6),  t605  (37.5),  t002,  t1784, 
t2066 (1.8), and 2 new ones: t10856 (10.7) and t10852 
(1.8). Five distinct sequence types (ST) were detected 
(% of isolates): ST1 (46.4), ST126 (37.5), ST133 (10.7), 
ST5 (3.6), and a novel ST registered as ST2493 (1.8). 
Resistances  were  detected  for  streptomycin,  chloram-
phenicol,  and  tetracycline.  One  strain  contained  the 
chloramphenicol resistance gene (fexA; included within 
transposon Tn558) and 3 strains contained the tetra-
cycline resistance gene [tet(K)]. Methicillin-susceptible 
Staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to most 
of  the  antibiotics  studied  and  lacked  the  virulence 
genes  of  Panton-Valentine  leukocidin  (lukF/S-PV), 
toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (tst), exfoliative toxin A

(eta), and exfoliative toxin B (etb), as well as the genes 
of the immune evasion cluster. Methicillin-susceptible 
Staphylococcus aureus isolates were detected in a rela-
tively low proportion of cows with mastitis (6.2%) and 
recovered  isolates  presented  high  diversity  of  genetic 
lineages, with CC1 and CC126 the predominant clonal 
complexes, and CC133 also being detected. Larger epi-
demiological studies with molecular characterization of 
isolates  are  required  to  deepen  the  knowledge  on  the 
circulating genetic lineages among the cow population 
with mastitis.

  INTRODUCTION 

  

  Milk production in Brazil is one of the most impor-
tant  branches  of  the  Brazilian  agribusiness  and  the 
country is the sixth leading producer of milk (Klein et 
al.,  2012).  Dairy  cow  mastitis  is  the  most  important 
disease in the dairy industry worldwide, and it is as-
sociated with pain and reduced well-being of affected 
animals (Halasa et al., 2007). Mastitis causes economic 
losses  due  to  reduced  milk  production,  milk  discard, 
premature slaughter, and antibiotic usage (McDougall 
et al., 2009). 

  In Brazil, several studies have reported the isolation 
of  Staphylococcus  aureus  in  milk  samples  from  cows 
with mastitis (Zafalon et al. 2007; Santos et al. 2008; 
Klein et al., 2012); however, studies related to molecu-
lar characterization of Staph. aureus from these types 
of milk samples are scarce. This microorganism is one 
of  the  most  important  etiological  agents  of  mastitis, 
which is of concern for humans and livestock (Capurro 
et al. 2010). Staphylococcus aureus can produce a wide 
range of extracellular toxins and virulence factors such 
as  Panton-Valentine  leukocidin  (PVL),  toxic  shock 
syndrome  toxin  (TSST),  and  several  exfoliatins  and 
enterotoxins,  which  represent  a  risk  for  humans  and 
animals,  being  associated  with  severe  infections  (Jar-
raud et al., 2002; Francis et al., 2005).

MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF METHICILLIN-SUSCEPTIBLE STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS

6857

Staphylococcus  aureus  can  acquire  methicillin  resis-
tance  (MRSA)  due  to  the  acquisition  of  the  mecA 
gene.  Methicillin  resistance  represents  an  important 
therapeutic  problem  when  implicated  in  human  or 
animal infections, and numerous studies have focused 
on the characterization of these isolates. Nevertheless, 
the  interest  on  methicillin-susceptible  Staph.  aureus 
(MSSA) has increased in recent years, given that they 
can also be implicated in important infections and may 
help  to  explain  the  appearance  and  evolution  of  the 
different and successful MRSA lineages. Few data exist 
in  the  circulating  genetic  lineages  of  MSSA  in  food-
producing  animals  or  in  derived  food  products,  as  in 
the case of milk.

Coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylo-
cocci were recovered in a previous study from milk of 
cows with mastitis from 10 farms in Brazil and entero-
toxin  genes  were  studied  in  these  isolates  (de  Freitas 
Guimarães et al., 2013). The present work focused on 
the molecular characterization of MSSA isolates recov-
ered in milk of mastitic cows in Brazil, analyzing the 
genetic lineages of the isolates as well as their content in 
antimicrobial resistance genes and in specific virulence 
genes, including, among others, the MSSA isolates ob-
tained in the previous study (de Freitas Guimarães et 
al., 2013).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Samples and Bacterial Isolates

A total of 4,684 milk samples from 1,171 cows (from 
the 4 teats) from 11 different farms in the state of São 
Paulo,  Brazil,  were  evaluated  for  mastitis  detection. 
The  methodology  and  interpretation  criteria  used  for 
diagnosis of clinical and subclinical mastitis were based 
on examination of animals before each milking by the 
California mastitis test (CMT; Schalm and Noorland-
er, 1957). From these samples, 1,484 of them, obtained 
from  518  cows,  were  CMT  positive  and  were  studied 
for staphylococci detection. The CMT-positive samples 
were plated on blood agar plates (Oxoid Brasil Ltda, 
São Paulo, Brazil) and incubated under aerobic condi-
tions at 37°C, and readings were performed after 24, 48, 
and 72 h of incubation. Identification of Staph. aureus 
was based on colony morphology, Gram staining, and 
catalase, coagulase, and DNase activities (Koneman et 
al.,  2008).  Molecular  identification  was  performed  by 
a  multiplex  PCR  that  also  allows  the  discrimination 
of MSSA and MRSA by amplification of the species-
specific  staphylococcal  nuclease  (nuc)  gene  and  the 
staphylococcal  methicillin-resistance  genetic  determi-
nant  (mecA;  CRL-AR,  2009).  One  MSSA  isolate  per 
positive mammary gland was characterized. The MSSA 

isolates from 10 of the studied farms (n = 50) were ob-
tained in a previous study (de Freitas Guimarães et al., 
2013), and those from 1 additional farm (n = 6) were 
obtained in the present study; all 56 MSSA isolates of 
the 11 farms were characterized in the present study.

Molecular Typing and Clonal  
Relatedness of MSSA Isolates

All  MSSA  isolates  were  characterized  by  spa  gene 
typing  (http://spaserver.ridom.de)  and  agr  allotype 
(Shopsin et al., 2003) by specific PCR. Multilocus se-
quence  typing  was  performed  as  previously  described 
(http://www.mlst.net)  on  1  representative  strain  per 
spa  type.  Pulsed-field  gel  electrophoresis  (PFGE)  of 
genomic  DNA,  previously  digested  with  the  macro-
restriction  SmaI  enzyme,  was  performed  on  1  strain 
per  spa  type  per  cow.  Pulsed-field  gel  electrophoresis 
band  profiles  were  compared  according  to  previously 
reported criteria (Tenover et al., 1995).

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing  
and Detection of Resistance Genes

Antimicrobial  susceptibility  testing  to  oxacillin, 
cefoxitin,  tetracycline,  erythromycin,  clindamycin, 
gentamicin,  tobramycin,  streptomycin,  trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole,  ciprofloxacin,  and  chloramphenicol 
was  performed  by  the  disk-diffusion  agar  method  in 
accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards 
Institute recommendations (CLSI, 2012). Detection of 
antimicrobial  resistance  genes  was  investigated  in  re-
sistant isolates by specific PCR (Table 1). Positive and 
negative controls from the collection of the University 
of La Rioja (Logroño, Spain) were used in each PCR 
assay.

Virulence Factors and Immune  
Evasion Cluster Genes

The presence of the genetic determinants of Panton-
Valentine  leukocidin  (lukF/S-PV),  toxic  shock  syn-
drome toxin 1 (tst), and exfoliative toxin A (eta) and B 
(etb) was analyzed by PCR (Lina et al., 1999; Jarraud 
et al., 2002). The presence of the human-associated im-
mune evasion cluster (IEC) genes (scn, chp, sak, hlb, 
sea, and sep), which were enclosed within the φ3 bacte-
riophage, was determined as previously recommended 
(van Wamel et al., 2006).

RESULTS

Staphylococcus aureus isolates were recovered from 97 
of the 1,484 CMT-positive milk samples tested (6.5%)

and were obtained in 10.2% of cows tested with mas-
titis.  Among  these,  56  isolates  were  MSSA  (57.7%  of 
total Staph. aureus), obtained from 3.7% of the tested 
CMT-positive milk samples and from 6.2% of mastitic 
cows (32 animals), and they were further characterized 
in  this  study  (1  isolate  per  positive  sample).  Among 
the 32 cows positive for MSSA detection, 17 of them 
presented this microorganism in milk samples of more 
than 1 teat (12 animals with 2 positive teats, 3 animals 
with  3  positive  teats,  and  2  animals  with  4  positive 
teats).

Molecular Typing of MSSA Isolates

Two  new  spa  types  were  identified  among  7  of  the 
56  tested  MSSA  isolates:  (1)  1  isolate  presented  the 
spa  type  t10852  and  was  also  ascribed  to  the  novel 
sequence  type  (ST)2493,  enclosed  within  clonal  com-
plex (CC)1, and (2) 6 isolates presented the spa type 
t10856 and were ascribed to ST133 (CC133). The other 
spa/ST/CC  types  detected  among  the  remaining  49 
MSSA  isolates  were  as  follows  (number  of  isolates  in 
parentheses): t605/ST126/CC126 (25), t127/ST1/CC1 
(21),  t002/ST5/CC5  (1),  t1784/ST1/CC1  (1),  and 
t2066/ST5/CC5 (1). The following agr allotypes were 
obtained (number of isolates in parentheses): agr-I (6), 
agr-II (23), and agr-III (27), whereas agr-IV was not 
found (Table 2). 

Journal of Dairy Science Vol. 96 No. 11, 2013

The  MSSA  isolates  recovered  from  different  teats 
presented similar genetic characteristics (spa/ST/CC) 
in  16  of  the  17  animals  that  carried  MSSA  in  more 
than 1 teat. The SmaI PFGE performed with 29 repre-
sentative MSSA isolates (1 per spa type and per cow) 
revealed  that  isolates  that  belonged  to  the  same  spa 
type  presented  identical  or  closely  related  patterns 
(less than 3 bands of difference; for example, patterns 
A1-A2-A3; Table 2), whereas those with a distinct spa 
type exhibited unrelated PFGE profiles (more than 6 
DNA bands of difference; for example, patterns A, B, 
or C; Table 2).

Antimicrobial Resistance, Toxin Genes,  
and IEC Profile of MSSA Isolates

Few  resistances  were  detected  among  our  MSSA 
isolates: streptomycin (50%), and chloramphenicol and 
tetracycline (3.5%). Three tetracycline-resistant isolates 
harbored  the  tetracycline-efflux  protein  (tetK)  gene 
and 1 chloramphenicol-resistant isolate the florfenicol-
chloramphenicol  exporter  gene  (fexA;  Table  3).  The 
possible inclusion of the fexA gene within the transpo-
son Tn558 was investigated (Kehrenberg and Schwarz, 
2006),  revealing  the  presence  of  the  transposase  gene 
(tnpA, tnpB, and tnpC) and orf138, characteristics of 
the  conserved  transposon.  In  addition,  circular  inter-
mediates were detected, indicating functional activity.

No streptomycin resistance genes were identified in the 
streptomycin-resistant staphylococci. All MSSA isolates 
were  negative  for  the  tested  toxin  genes  (lukF/S-PV, 
tst, eta, and etb) as well as for the IEC genes (scn, chp, 
sak, hlb, sea, and sep).

DISCUSSION

The occurrence of MSSA isolates among milk sam-
ples  of  cows  with  mastitis  detected  in  our  study  was 
relatively low (6.2% of cows with mastitis tested). Nev-
ertheless, other staphylococci (both coagulase-positive 
and coagulase-negative) were present in these samples 
(up to 20% of CMT-positive samples contained staphy-
lococci),  as  has  been  previously  reported  (de  Freitas 
Guimarães  et  al.,  2013),  and  could  be  implicated  in 
clinical  or  subclinical  mastitis,  with  Staph.  aureus 
the  most  important  species  among  coagulase-positive 
staphylococci. Milk contamination with Staph. aureus 
is of concern because it puts at risk people working on 
the farm. Moreover, contaminated milk can reach the 
consumer in case of inefficient pasteurization or when 

raw milk is used illegally for the production of Minas 
cheese  or  other  dairy  product.  Lee  (2003)  suggested 
a  possible  transmission  of  Staph.  aureus  from  cows 
to  humans.  Other  studies  refer  higher  prevalences  of 
Staph. aureus or MSSA in milk samples (Coelho et al., 
2009; D’Amico and Donnelly, 2010; Haran et al., 2012; 
Oikonomou et al., 2012).

The  most  prevalent  spa  types  among  our  MSSA 
isolates from bovine sources were t127 and t605, and 
it  is  in  accordance  with  previous  reports  from  Brazil 
(Aires-de-Sousa  et  al.,  2007;  Rabello  et  al.,  2007).  In 
Canada,  MSSA  strains  of  lineage  t605  were  also  ob-
served  (Said  et  al.,  2010),  whereas  t127  isolates  have 
been  previously  isolated  from  Switzerland  and  Korea 
(Huber et al., 2010; Hwang et al., 2010). Alternatively, 
other studies on milk samples from cows with mastitis 
showed Staph. aureus with different spa types to those 
detected among our MSSA isolates (Johler et al., 2011; 
Haran et al., 2012).

The database of the Ridom spa server network for spa 
typing (http://spaserver.ridom.de) shows that spa type 
t127 has a relative global frequency of 1.9% and t605

of the state of São Paulo, whereas those with spa type 
t10856  were  found  in  2  distinct  regions  (B  and  D). 
The 56 strains were distributed in 4 clonal complexes: 
CC1,  CC5,  CC126,  and  CC133.  Among  these,  CC1 
and  CC126  were  predominant.  Rabello  et  al.  (2007) 
observed the same clonal complexes in a study in Brazil 
from milk samples collected from cows with subclinical 
mastitis. The clonal complexes CC1 and CC5 are com-
mon among human isolates (Argudín et al., 2011; Loz-
ano et al., 2012) and Juhász-Kaszanyitzky et al. (2007) 
reported strains of CC1 in humans and bovines. Franco 
et al. (2011) suggested that transmission of this lineage 
(CC1)  from  animals  to  humans  is  possible,  although 
differences exist in the host-specific genetic characteris-
tics between the 2 clusters. The clonal complex CC126 
is not common among isolates from human beings and 
several studies observed this CC in ruminants (Smith 
et al., 2005; Aires-de-Sousa et al., 2007; Rabello et al., 
2007), suggesting that ruminants are reservoirs for this 
CC.

The novel spa type t10856 belongs to CC133. Previ-
ous  studies  have  reported  the  existence  of  CC133  in 
clinical Staph. aureus isolates from bovines (Rabello et 
al., 2007; Schlotter et al., 2012) and this lineage is very 
common in small ruminants (Guinane et al., 2010) and 
also in ungulates (Gharsa et al., 2012). It has been sug-
gested that the CC133 clone is a result of a host jump 
from humans to these animals by an adaptive genome 
diversification  from  allelic  variation,  gene  decay,  and 
horizontal acquisition of mobile genetic elements con-
taining virulence genes (Guinane et al. 2010).

The  agr  types  I,  II,  and  III  were  detected  among 
our MSSA isolates, with agr types II and III the most 
frequently detected. Isolates of lineage ST1/CC1 were 
included in agr type III but 1 strain was included in 
agr type I.

The  4  virulence  factors  studied  in  this  work  (re-
lated to the Panton-Valentine leukocidin, toxic-shock-
syndrome-toxin  1,  and  exfoliative  toxin  A  and  B)  in 
MSSA  isolates  were  negative.  Nevertheless,  these  iso-
lates could contain other virulence genes as is the case 
for enterotoxins (de Freitas Guimarães et al., 2013). A 
recent  study  showed  Staph.  aureus  strains  from  milk 
from animals with mastitis with the etb gene encoding 
the exfoliative toxin B (Salasia et al., 2011).

Antibiotic  susceptibility  testing  revealed  that  27  of 
the 56 isolates (48.2%) showed susceptibility to all an-
tibiotics  tested.  Other  studies  reported  susceptibility 
rates  of  42%  (Coelho  et  al.,  2009)  or  67%  (Aires-de-
Sousa  et  al.,  2007)  among  bovine  Staph.  aureus,  the 
latter from farms located in Rio de Janeiro State. The 

Journal of Dairy Science Vol. 96 No. 11, 2013

detection  in  1  isolate  of  the  complete  and  conserved 
Tn558, which carries the chloramphenicol and florfeni-
col resistance gene fexA, is remarkable and, to the best 
of our knowledge, it represents the first description of 
this  transposon  in  staphylococci  in  Brazil.  Since  its 
first description in a Staphylococcus lentus isolate from 
a  cow  with  a  respiratory  tract  infection  (Kehrenberg 
and Schwarz, 2004), this transposon has been detected 
in  Staphylococcus  lentus  simulans, Staphylococcus  len-
tus chromogenes, and Staphylococcus lentus sciuri from 
bovines and in equine Staph. aureus isolates (Kehren-
berg and Schwarz, 2006), Staphylococcus cohnii isolates 
from swine farms in China (Wang et al., 2012), and in 
Bacillus  from  swine  feces  (Dai  et  al.,  2010).  Further 
molecular epidemiological studies are required to assess 
the burden of this mobile genetic element among the 
Brazilian  cow  population.  Interestingly,  streptomycin-
resistant strains did not contain the expected resistance 
genes, suggesting the presence of mutations in specific 
ribosomal proteins or unknown resistance mechanisms 
to  this  antibiotic  that  should  be  characterized  in  the 
future.

CONCLUSIONS

Methicillin-susceptible  Staph.  aureus  isolates  were 
recovered  in  approximately  3.7%  of  milk  samples 
tested,  representing  57.7%  of  all  Staph.  aureus  recov-
ered. The major lineages detected among MSSA were 
CC126 and CC1, followed by the ruminant-associated 
CC133.  In  general,  MSSA  strains  were  susceptible  to 
most antibiotics studied, although the detection of the 
conserved transposon Tn558 evidences potential acqui-
sition capacities. In spite of the absence of streptomycin 
resistance  genes  studied,  50%  of  MSSA  strains  were 
resistant  to  this  antibiotic  in  the  diffusion  disk  test, 
suggesting that other genes could be implicated. Due 
to  the  scarce  data  available  on  molecular  character-
istics  of  Staph.  aureus  isolates  from  cattle  in  Brazil, 
continued  epidemiological  surveillance  is  essential  to 
gain knowledge on the circulating lineages responsible 
for cow mastitis in this major milk-producing country, 
due  to  its  potential  implications  in  both  animal  and 
human health.
