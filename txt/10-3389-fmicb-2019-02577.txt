the prospect

Pickled ready-to-eat meat (PRTEM)
is a meat product that is treated with various
seasonings and then cooked. PRTEM is a popular food consumed mostly in China
and some Asian countries. Since this food is considered ‘ready to eat’, once it
is contaminated by foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella,
for
signiﬁcant morbidity, mortality, and immeasurable economic losses can occur. Here we
investigated the prevalence and concentration of Salmonella in 107 PRTEM samples
collected from Shaanxi, China during 2015–2016. Furthermore, we analyzed the
serotype, antibiotic susceptibility, and presence of antibiotic resistance genes and amino
acid mutations in 219 Salmonella isolates, followed by subtyping of 115 representative
isolates. The average detection rate of Salmonella-positive PRTEM was 58.9%, and
the average most probable number (MPN) of Salmonella in positive samples was
2.27 logMPN per gram of sample (range: 2.10–2.43). Ten serotypes were identiﬁed
from the 219 Salmonella isolates, with S. Thompson (37.9%) and S. Indiana (20.5%)
being predominant. The remaining serotypes were S. Typhi (7.8%), S. Typhimurium
(7.3%), S. Mbandaka (6.9%), S. Albany (6.4%), S. Blockley (5.5%), S. Infantis (4.1%),
S. Escanaba (3.2%), and S. Dusseldorf (0.5%). All
isolates were resistant to ceftiofur
(100%), while most of them were resistant to ciproﬂoxacin (99.1%), amoxicillin-clavulanic
acid (97.7%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (96.4%), ampicillin (92.3%), sulﬁsoxazole
(92.2%), tetracyclines (90.4%), and nalidixic acid (90.4%), respectively. A single mutation
of Ser83Phe (27.1%) and double mutations of Ser83Phe-Asp87Gly (25.9%) in GyrA
were detected in 85 isolates, whereas mutations of Thr57Ser (63.9%) and Ser80Arg
(36.1%) in ParC were detected in 122 isolates. qnrB, oqxAB, aac(6(cid:48))-Ib, and qnrA were
present in 50 (22.8%), 48 (21.9%), 26 (11.9%), and 1 (0.5%) isolate(s), respectively.
Pulse ﬁeld gel electrophoresis results revealed that those isolates recovered from
the same type of PRTEM or the same sampling place shared identical or similar
DNA proﬁles, antibiotic resistance phenotypes, and even plasmid-mediated quinolone

resistance encoding genes. The ﬁndings indicate that Salmonella is commonly prevalent
in PRTEMs at high concentrations in Shaanxi, China. More attention should be paid to
the processing and storage of this ready-to-eat food to prevent bacterial contamination
and foodborne outbreaks.

INTRODUCTION

Salmonella is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria that causes
human gastroenteritis, enteric fever, and other fatal diseases.
It is recognized as one of the major pathogens for public
health and food safety (Liu et al., 2018). According to
Majowicz et al. (2010), approximately 94 million people in the
world experienced salmonellosis, resulting in 155,000 deaths
each year. In China, approximately 70% of bacterial illnesses
were due to Salmonella in recent years (Chong et al., 2017;
Liu et al., 2017; Xing et al., 2018). Currently, Salmonella
is still an important pathogen associated with foodborne
outbreaks and human diseases in the United States and most
European countries (Centers for Disease Control [CDC], 2014;
European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), 2017).

To date, more than 2610 Salmonella serotypes have been
identiﬁed, among which Salmonella Typhimurium, S. Indiana,
and S. Enteritidis are the most common serotypes involved in
an increasing number of foodborne outbreaks in some countries
(Gong et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017). In animal husbandry,
antibiotics have been used as the ﬁrst choice of treatment to
prevent animal diseases. Especially ﬂuoroquinolones, which have
been widely used in life-threatening salmonellosis treatment, are
often applied in breeding and augmented growth of animals
for food (Voss-Rech et al., 2016). Although poultry and poultry
products are considered the primary hosts of Salmonella (Yang
et al., 2011), members of this genus have been recovered from
various foods including pork (Sanchez-Maldonado et al., 2016),
nuts (Zhang et al., 2017), vegetables (Han et al., 2008), and
other retail products (Ed-Dra et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2016;
Yang et al., 2010).

Pickled ready-to-eat meat (PRTEM) is a type of spiced
food that is usually processed and cooked. Examples include
chicken, duck, and pork products with diﬀerent seasonings,
which are
extremely popular and mostly consumed in
China, especially during summer. Based on data obtained
Industry Information Repository,
from the China Meat
the total amount of ready-to-eat
(RTE) meats consumed
will approximate 59.7 million tons in 2020 in China, 16.7
million tons of which will be poultry meats (Cheng et al.,
2015). Survey results of Salmonella prevalence in retail foods
across various provinces and cities in China have shown an
upward trend in recent years (Wu et al., 2014; Inns et al.,
2017; Li et al., 2018). Among various foodstuﬀs, RTE meats
are considered high-risk foods that can and do result
in
foodborne diseases throughout the world including China (Fang
et al., 2012). However, the prevalence and characteristics of

Salmonella in RTE meats including PRTEM have not been
thoroughly investigated.

In this study, we assessed the prevalence and concentration
of Salmonella in PRTEM in Shaanxi Province, China.
Furthermore, we explored the diversity of serotype, genotype,
and antibiotic susceptibility of Salmonella isolates to better
understand the current situation of food safety with respect to
RTE meats in China.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample Collection
One hundred and seven PRTEM samples were randomly
collected from diﬀerent supermarkets and retail stalls in the wet
markets across Shaanxi Province, China from December 2015 to
December 2016. Those PRTEMs are usually made by cooking
fresh or frozen livestock and poultry meat including internal
organs as the main raw ingredient with the addition of salt, soy
sauce and other condiments. For retail, the cooked-bulk meat was
often cut into small pieces and mixed with seasonings including
salt, vinegar, fresh green onion, chili pepper and some other
spices. During the sampling period, each supermarket and retail
stall were visited twice, with no more than six samples collected
in each market and/or stall. The samples mainly included pickled

Salmonella in Pickled Ready-to-Eat Meat

chicken wing, chicken foot, chicken gizzard, chicken heart, duck
neck, duck intestine, duck wing, and duck head (Table 1). After
collection, each sample was placed in a separate sterile sampling
bag and kept at 4◦C before analysis. To avoid bacterial growth in
the samples, their transportation time from the sampling places
to the laboratory lasted no longer than 2 h. Each sample was
aseptically mashed on a clean bench. Then, 25 g of the sample
was weighed into a sterile homogeneous bag containing 225 mL
of buﬀered peptone water (BPW; Luqiao Biotech., Beijing, China)
and shaken at 100–120 rpm for 5 min. The BPW rinse solution
was used for enumeration and isolation of Salmonella.

Bacterial Enrichment, Enumeration, and
Isolation
The most-probable-number (MPN) technique issued by the
Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) was used for enumeration of
Salmonella with some minor modiﬁcations (USDA/FSIS, 2014).
Brieﬂy, 1. 0-, 0. 1-, and 0.01-mL aliquots of the BPW rinse
solution (representing 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 g of PRTEM) were
added to sterile tubes with 9.0, 9.9, and 9.99 mL of BPW,
respectively (n = 3 each). After the solutions were thoroughly
mixed, the tubes were incubated in a shaking bath at 37◦C at
100 rpm for 18–24 h.
A portion (0.5 ± 0.05 mL) of each pre-enriched culture was
subsequently transferred into 10 mL of tetrathionate broth (TTB,
Luqiao Biotech.), whereas 0.1 ± 0.02 mL of the culture was
inoculated into 10 mL of modiﬁed Rappaport Vassiliadis broth
(mRV, Luqiao Biotech.). The inoculated TTB and mRV broths
were incubated at 37 ± 0.5◦C with shaking at 100 rpm for 18–
24 h. A loopful of TTB or mRV culture of each dilution and
replicate was streaked onto xylose lysine tergitol 4 agar (XLT4;
BD, Biosciences, San Jose, CA, United States) plates and then
incubated at 35 ± 2◦C for 22–24 h. One to two presumptive
Salmonella colonies per plate were selected and puriﬁed on
fresh XLT4 plates.

A single colony with typical Salmonella characteristics (e.g.,
black color, round shape, and smooth surface) was picked and
inoculated onto a Luria-Bertani agar (LB; Luqiao Biotech.) plate.
The Salmonella isolates were conﬁrmed by the agglutination
method using Salmonella poly A-F antiserum sera (S&A
Company, Bangkok, Thailand). The MPN value of Salmonella
in each sample was determined via the USDA-FSIS MPN table.
One isolate from each Salmonella-positive TTB and/or mRV
tube was selected even if they were derived from the same
sample. The Salmonella isolates were stored at −80◦C in LB
broth/glycerol (50/50%, V/V).

Antibiotic Susceptibility Test
All Salmonella isolates were tested for their susceptibility to 15
antibiotics using the agar dilution method (Table 2) developed
by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute [CLSI], 2014). The category of
antibiotics corresponded to that of the National Antimicrobial
Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) managed by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (USDA) and the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Breakpoint for

resistance or susceptibility interpretation to each antibiotic was
in accordance with the CLSI standards (Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute [CLSI], 2014), while the breakpoint for
streptomycin was in accordance with that of the NARMS used for
susceptibility testing of Salmonella and Escherichia coli (NARMS,
2011). E. coli ATCC 25922 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212
were used as positive control bacteria.

Serotyping
The Salmonella isolates were serotyped at the Shaanxi Center
for Disease Control and Prevention (Xi’an, Shaanxi, China).
Salmonella O and H antigens were determined via the slide
agglutination method using Salmonella-speciﬁc hyper-immune
sera (S&A Company), and the serotype of each isolate was
assigned following the Kauﬀmann–White scheme and the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Detection of Antibiotic Resistance Genes
and Amino Acid Mutations
Isolates with nalidixic acid or/and ciproﬂoxacin resistance were
screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of
plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) encoding genes
of qnr alleles (i.e., qnrA, qnrB, and qnrS), aac(6(cid:48))-Ib, qepA, and
oqxAB. PCR ampliﬁcation and DNA sequencing were employed
for detection of amino acid substitution of quinolone resistance
determining regions (QRDRs) in GyrA and ParC. Primers
and annealing temperatures for individual ampliﬁcation are
listed in Table 3.
Polymerase chain reaction was conducted in 25 µL reactions
containing 0.3 µL of 50 pM each primer, 2.5 µL of 10 × PCR
buﬀer, 2 µL of 2.5 mM of dNTP mix, 0.25 µL of 5 U/µL TaqDNA
polymerase (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), 1.5 µL of 25 mM MgCl2,
5 µL of template DNA using a MyCircle PCR machine (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, United States), and 13.15 µL of double-distilled
H2O. The PCR conditions were as follows: incubation at 94◦C
for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94◦C for 30 s, an annealing
temperature for 30 s, and 72◦C for 30 s; and a ﬁnal extension step
at 72◦C for 10 min. The PCR products were dyed by red gel and
visualized under UV light (Bio-Rad) after electrophoresis.

For GyrA and ParC sequence analysis, the PCR products
were stored in a box with dry ice and sent
to AuGCT
Biotech. (Beijing, China) where DNA sequencing was performed
on an Illumina platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA,
United States). The obtained sequences were aligned using the
online BLAST program1. Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 was used
as a positive control.

Pulse-Field Gel Electrophoresis
According to the sampling place, sampling time, sample type,
and selective Salmonella enrichment broth, 115 of 219 isolates
were selected for pulse-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) subtyping
with XbaI. The PFGE was carried out according to the protocol
issued by the CDC for Salmonella, E. coli, and Shigella (Ribot
et al., 2006). Brieﬂy, the Salmonella isolate was streaked onto
LB agar (Luqiao Biotech.) and incubated overnight at 37◦C.

Appropriate numbers of Salmonella cells were ﬁrst suspended
into cell suspension buﬀer (containing 10 mL of 1 M Tris
and 20 mL of 0.5 M EDTA, adjusted to 100 mL with sterile
double-distilled H2O) and then embedded using Seakem Gold
agarose (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). After cell lysis, the released
DNA was digested using 50 U of XbaI enzyme (TaKaRa) at
37◦C for 1.5–2 h. The digested DNA fragments were separated
in 0.5 × Tris–borate-EDTA buﬀer at 14◦C using a ChefMapper
electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad) for 20 h. The pulse time
for electrophoresis was between 2.16 and 63.8 S. Salmonella
Braenderup H9812 was used as a standard control.

After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with ethidium
bromide, and the DNA bands were illuminated under UV
light (Bio-Rad). The results were manually analyzed using
BioNumerics v3.0 (Applied-Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium).

Statistical Analysis
Minitab 18 (Minitab Inc., State College, PA, United States)
was used for statistical analysis. Pearson chi-square test was
used to determine the diﬀerences in the concentration of
Salmonella, detection rate of Salmonella-positive samples, and
serotypes in PRTEMs across diﬀerent places (i.e., wet markets

and supermarkets) and diﬀerent meat types (i.e., pickled chicken
and duck meats). The results were compared at the 5% (∂ = 0.05)
level to evaluate whether a signiﬁcant diﬀerence was observed.
The MPN value of Salmonella per gram PRTEM was log-
transformed using approximate normality. The relationship
between logMPN per gram PRTEM and other variables was
assessed using the generalized linear model with the identity
link function and adjusted dependency within sample type using
generalized estimated equations. Signiﬁcant diﬀerences were
considered at P < 0.05.

RESULTS

Prevalence and Concentration of
Salmonella
Sixty-three (58.9%) of 107 PRTEMs were positive for Salmonella,
and the average concentration of Salmonella in Salmonella-
positive samples was 2.27 logMPN per gram PRTEM. The
detection rate of Salmonella-positive samples
signiﬁcantly
(P < 0.01) diﬀered between the two types of marketplace. While
no Salmonella-positive PRTEM was detected in supermarkets,
63 Salmonella-positive samples (81.8%, 63/77) were found in
retail stalls in the wet markets. The detection rate of Salmonella-
positive duck products (69.2%, 36/52) was signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05)
higher than that of chicken products (49.1%, 27/55). The
most common Salmonella-positive chicken product was chicken
foot (63.2%), whereas for duck products,
it was duck head
(85.7%; Table 1).

The concentrations of Salmonella in Salmonella-positive
samples ranged from 2.10 to 2.43 logMPN per gram PRTEM.
The maximum value of Salmonella was detected in chicken wing
(2.43 logMPN per gram PRTEM), while the minimum value
was detected in duck wing (2.10 logMPN per gram PRTEM).
No signiﬁcant (P > 0.05) diﬀerence was found in MPN values
among the eight types of PRTEM samples that were positive for
Salmonella (Table 1).

Salmonella Serotypes
During MPN enumeration, a total of 219 Salmonella-positive
TTB and mRV tubes/cultures were identiﬁed. Therefore, 219
isolates (one per positive tube/culture) were recovered in this
study and used for subsequent analyses. Among the 219 isolates
that were all recovered from samples of retail stalls in the wet
markets, 17 (7.8%) were typhoidal Salmonella (TS) and 202
(92.2%) were non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS). Among the 17 TS
isolates, there were 5 (29.4%) from chicken heart, 4 (23.5%) from
chicken gizzard, 4 (23.5%) from duck intestine, 3 (17.7%) from
duck neck, and 1 (5.9%) from duck wing. Interestingly, although
these TS isolates were derived from diﬀerent types of PRTEM,
they were collected from the same retail stall.

Nine serotypes were identiﬁed from the 202 NTS isolates,
with S. Thompson (83; 41.1%) and S. Indiana (44; 21.8%) being
the most common serotypes. Other serotypes among the NTS
isolates were S. Typhimurium (16; 7.9%), S. Mbandaka (15; 7.4%),
S. Albany (14; 6.9%), S. Blockley (12; 5.9%), S. Infantis (10;

5.0%), S. Escanaba (7; 3.5%), and S. Dusseldorf (1; 0.5%). Thirty-
four isolates derived from chicken wing were all S. Thompson,
16 isolates from chicken gizzard were all S. Indiana, whereas
four isolates from duck head were all S. Mbandaka. Additionally,
5, 5, and six serotypes were identiﬁed from the isolates that
were derived from chicken foot, duck neck, and duck wing,
respectively (Table 4).

In addition to chicken wing, S. Thompson isolates were also
found in chicken foot, chicken heart, duck neck, duck intestine,
and duck wing. The detection rate of Salmonella Thompson
isolates in chicken wing was signiﬁcantly (P < 0.01) higher than
those in chicken gizzard and duck head. However, no signiﬁcant
(P > 0.05) diﬀerence was observed in the detection rate of S.
Thompson isolates among chicken foot, duck neck, and duck
wing (Figure 1A) as well as in the detection rate of S. Albany
isolates in chicken foot and duck neck (Figure 1E). Similarly,
there were signiﬁcant (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) diﬀerences in
the detection rates of S. Indiana (Figure 1B), S. Typhimurium
(Figure 1C), S. Mbandaka (Figure 1D), and S. Blockley isolates
(Figure 1F) among the Salmonella isolates recovered from
diﬀerent types of PRTEMs.

Antibiotic Susceptibility
All Salmonella isolates were resistant to ceftiofur; the detection
rate (100.0%) of resistant isolates was signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05)
higher than those resistant to the 13 other antibiotics tested
for, including amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (97.7%), trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole (96.4%), ampicillin (92.2%),
sulﬁsoxazole
(92.2%), tetracycline (90.4%), and nalidixic acid (90.4%; Table 5).
All Salmonella isolates were co-resistant to at least ﬁve antibiotics,
whereas 24 isolates (11.0%) were co-resistant to 5–8 antibiotics,
59 isolates (26.9%) were resistant to 9–12 antibiotics, and 136
isolates (62.1%) were resistant to 13–15 antibiotics tested.

were signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) higher than those corresponding
resistant isolates derived from pickled duck. Additionally, the
detection rates of chicken-borne isolates resistant to tetracycline
(100.0%), chloramphenicol (99.0%), kanamycin (86.9%), and
gentamycin (77.8%) were signiﬁcantly higher (P < 0.01) than
those corresponding resistant isolates derived from pickled duck.
Interestingly, all
isolates recovered from chicken wing were
resistant to 14 antibiotics tested for, except streptomycin. There
was a similar situation among isolates recovered from pickled
gizzard and duck head (Table 5).

kanamycin, gentamicin, amikacin, cefoxitin, and streptomycin.
A similar phenomenon was noted for S. Blockley and S.
Mbandaka isolates (Table 6).

Presence of Antibiotic Resistance Genes
and Amino Acid Mutations
A total of 237 amino acid substitutions were detected in 219
isolates resistant to nalidixic acid or/and ciproﬂoxacin. Among
these, 115 GyrA mutations in 85 (38.8%) isolates and 122
ParC mutations in 122 (57.7%) isolates were noted. For the
GyrA mutations, the most commonly observed was Ser83Phe
(23/85, 27.1%), followed by Asp87Asn (9/85, 10.6%), Ser83Tyr
(9/85, 10.6%), Asp87Gly (7/85, 8.2%), Val90Leu (4/85, 4.7%),
Ala93Ser (1/85, 1.2%), Ala93Val (1/85, 1.2%), and Ser83Thr (1/85,
1.2%). The most frequently observed double mutations in GyrA
were Ser83Phe-Asp87Gly (22/85, 25.9%), followed by Ser83Phe-
Asp87Asn (4/85, 4.7%) and Ser83Tyr-Asp87Gly (4/85, 4.7%).
Mutations in ParC were Thr57Ser (78/122, 63.9%) and Ser80Arg
(44/122, 36.1%), respectively. GyrA and ParC mutations were
simultaneously detected in 48 (21.9%) Salmonella isolates.
No qnrS and qepA were detected in any isolates. Nonetheless,
qnrB, oqxAB, aac(6(cid:48))-Ib, and qnrA were detected in 50 (22.8%), 48
(21.9%), 26 (11.9%), and 1 (0.5%) isolates, respectively. Twenty-
four Salmonella isolates co-carried two of the PMQR genes tested
for. Ten Salmonella isolates had mutations in both GyrA and
ParC, while they simultaneously carried qnr or aac(6(cid:48))-Ib genes.
Additionally, 29 isolates were detected as having both amino acid
mutations and oqxAB genes.

PFGE Subtyping
Each isolate produced 13–16 bands with the typing rate of 100%.
According to a cut-oﬀ value of 90% similarity, 115 isolates were

grouped into ﬁve clusters (data not shown). PFGE proﬁles of
103 NTS isolates of the top ﬁve serotypes (i.e., S. Thompson,
S. Indiana, S. Typhimurium, S. Mbandaka, and S. Albany) are
shown in Figures 2–6, whereas PFGE proﬁles of the 12 TS isolates
are shown in Figure 7.

The Salmonella isolates recovered from the same type of
PRTEM commonly shared the same DNA proﬁles, antibiotic
resistance phenotype, and even PMQR encoding genes (Figure 2:
sub-clusters T-2-1, T-2-3; Figure 3: clusters I-2, I-3; Figure 4:
cluster ST-1, ST-3; Figure 6: clusters A-1, A-2). Although some
isolates were derived from diﬀerent types of PRTEMs across
various sampling places, they still showed identical or similar
DNA proﬁles, antibiotic resistance proﬁles, and PMQR genes
(Figure 2: cluster T-1, T-2-2, T-2-4, T-3-1, and T-3-2; Figure 3:
cluster I-1 and I-2; Figure 4: cluster ST-2 and ST-4; and Figure 5:
cluster M-2 and M-3).

For the DNA ﬁngerprints of 12 S. Typhi isolates, although
some were the same and/or highly similar (98% similarity)
in their phylogeny, these isolates could be grouped into four
clusters. Isolates derived from the same type of PRTEM were
essentially grouped into the same sub-clusters (Figure 7; Ti-2,
Ti-3, Ti-4). Moreover, some other strains isolated from diﬀerent
types of PRTEM showed an extremely close phylogenetic
relationship (Figure 7, Ti-1, Ti-3).

DISCUSSION

As a foodborne pathogen, Salmonella has resulted in widespread
concern and led to socio-economic pressures around the world
(Wen et al., 2017). According to data from the USDA, chicken
and chicken products are the main vehicles of Salmonella and
important causes of human Salmonella infections; while 37% of
chickens have been positive for Salmonella, 50–100% of other

poultry and eggs have also been shown to carry Salmonella2
(Voss-Rech et al., 2016). In the current study, we found that all
Salmonella-positive PRTEM samples were obtained from retail
stalls in the wet markets. This result revealed that unsatisfactory
hygienic conditions might be the main reason for Salmonella
contamination in the wet markets. This is especially notable given
that no positive samples were detected in supermarkets.

At present, the traditional PRTEM products in China are
commonly processed using raw meat with seasonings (i.e., salt,
soy sauce, and spices), and water is used as the heating medium.
Such PRTEM often contains halogen liquid, with high water
content and slightly acidic pH (5.8–6.2) (Zhao et al., 2011).
Due to its high water content and adequate nutrition, the
PRTEM provides an excellent medium for microbial growth
and reproduction (Li, 2015). In most situations, the PRTEM
sold in the wet markets is processed by individual peddlers.

2http://www.fsis.usda.gov

Thus, the bacterial prevalence in their raw meat, seasonings,
and processing environment is largely unknown. Once the raw
material is contaminated by pathogens and cross-contamination
occurs, the PRTEM will inevitably carry pathogenic bacteria
(Zhang et al., 2016).

According to the National Food Safety Standards of China
(version GB 29921-2013, GB 4789.4-2016), Salmonella should
not be detectable in 25 g of cooked or RTE food samples.
However, here we found that 63 (58.9%) samples were positive
for Salmonella in the 107 commercial PRTEM products.
This detection rate of Salmonella-positive samples is close
to the 57.5% of street-vended foods (n = 40) in Ethiopia
(Mulugeta and Million, 2013), yet it is much higher than
the 41.0% of RTE meats (n = 79) in Taiwan (Manguiat
and Fang, 2013), and the 40.0% of RTE meats (n = 20)
in Havana, Namibia (Shiningeni et al., 2018). On the other
hand, other studies have reported extremely low detection
rates of Salmonella-positive samples (<4.0%) in RTE meat

these results

The average concentration of Salmonella in the PRTEMs
tested in this study was 2.27 logMPN per gram of sample, which
is much higher than the level in RTE foods previously reported
(Yang et al., 2016). According to the habits of most consumers,
PRTEM tends not to be re-processed by heating, seasoning,
and/or microwaving before consumption. On the contrary, it
is eaten directly as a RTE product. Therefore, the high MPN
values reported in this study indicated that Salmonella-positive

PRTEM foods could pose a serious risk to the health and safety of
the consumers. For example, in 2010, a S. Typhimurium U323
infection outbreak involving 172 cases occurred in Denmark,
which was associated with speciﬁc ready-to-eat spreadable pork
sausage (Teewurst) (Kuhn et al., 2013). In another national
outbreak of S. Give in Malta, four restaurants and 26 (72%)
human cases were involved, and ready-to-eat antipasti in three
of the four restaurants were provided by the same manufacturer
(Donachie et al., 2018).

It is very interesting that no Salmonella-positive samples
were detected in those PRTEMs collected from supermarkets
(n = 30). However, from retail stalls in the wet markets, the

positive rate was as high as 81.8%. Based on our observation
and investigation, the following factors might have contributed
to the fact that Salmonella was only prevalent in the PRTEMs
from the wet markets in this survey: (1) PRTEMs sold in the
wet markets were typically handled in a family workshop, where
the sanitation of the processing environment is more diﬃcult
to ensure. Furthermore, the narrow operation space facilitates
the chance of cross-contamination between processed PRTEMs

and raw meat/poultry products. (2) No sterile vacuum or aseptic
packaging was used. During PRTEM processing, long processing
times and high temperature treatments can kill almost all
bacterial, viral, protozoan, and fungal organisms that are present
in the foods, and application of outer and/or inner packaging
is an eﬀective procedure in preventing the food from being
contaminated. However, no PRTEMs were found to be packaged
after processing in these small
family workshops. During

sale time, such unpackaged PRTEMs are stored at ambient
temperatures and completely exposed to the environment, where
the chances of further contamination consequently increase. (3)
No face masks or gloves were worn by the handlers and sellers
during the cutting and weighing of PRTEMs.

Antibiotics are eﬀective chemicals

for prevention and
treatment of microbial diseases, especially salmonellosis, and thus
have been widely used in animal production during the last
few decades. However, their usage is also known to promote
the occurrence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. According to a
latest report, approximately half of the antibiotics in China
are commonly used as feed additives in livestock and poultry
farming (Chen et al., 2019). Due to the incompleteness of
the regulatory system, inadequate interest, and other reasons,
manufacturers and farmers have encountered a series of problems
such as abuse of antibiotics, which in turn leads to increased
bacterial resistance, harm to human health, and environmental
damage (Chen et al., 2019). Meanwhile, the types of antifungal
drugs currently used for crops are 10 times the types of
human and animal drugs (Fisher et al., 2018). With the
widespread use of antibiotics for diﬀerent purposes, many
pathogens always exist in a stress environment3. Resistance
in Salmonella thus has shown a continuous upward trend
and emerged as a signiﬁcant public health threat (Voss-Rech
et al., 2016; Ed-Dra et al., 2017). Here, we found the 219
Salmonella isolates from PRTEM samples were widely resistant
to the 15 antibiotics tested in this study. Speciﬁcally,
the
detection rates of nalidixic acid- and ciproﬂoxacin-resistant
isolates were 90.4 and 99.1%, respectively. These values are
similar to those rates of resistance previously observed in
food-producing animals (Gong et al., 2017; Lai et al., 2014).
Although samples in those studies were not RTE foods, the
situation and problem of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella is both
similar and severe.

The rates of nalidixic acid- and ciproﬂoxacin-resistant
Salmonella in RTE foods across China (56 and 10%, respectively),
to the two antibiotics are considerably higher than those to
foods sold in street-vended restaurants in Senegal (0.4 and 1.1%,
respectively) (Dione et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2016). This diﬀerence
may be attributed to the fact that these isolates were recovered
from various districts across diﬀerent time periods, while distinct
antibiotics were used across countries and regions. A study also
showed that most Salmonella isolates in RTE foods were resistant
to at least ﬁve antibiotics, while some were insusceptible to nine
or more antibiotics; 42.0–77.7% of the isolates were multidrug
resistant (Xia et al., 2009). In the current study, although some
Salmonella isolates were susceptible to speciﬁc antibiotics, 24
(11.0%) of the total isolates were co-resistant to 5–8 antibiotics,
59 (26.9%) were co-resistant to 9–12 antibiotics, and 136 (62.1%)
were co-resistant to 13–15 antibiotics. The implications of these
data are both serious and terrifying. In China, resistance of
Salmonella to antibiotics, especially ﬂuoroquinolones, has been
inexorably increasing and expanding on an annual basis (Lai
et al., 2014). If the prevalence of Salmonella in retail foods
including PRTEM is not eﬃciently prevented and controlled,

3http://www.siﬁc.com.cn/InsidePage/1000/73/8210.html

it is likely that consumers will ingest high concentrations of
multidrug-resistant Salmonella, which could be fatal.

Mutations in the QRDR are typically associated with nalidixic
acid and ciproﬂoxacin resistance (Gong et al., 2017). Herein, 115
GyrA mutations were detected in 85 (38.8%, 85/219) isolates and
122 ParC mutations in 122 (55.7%, 122/219) isolates. The GyrA
mutations mainly occurred as Ser83Phe, Ser83Tyr, Ser83Thr,
and Asp87Asn, whereas ParC mutations were Thr57Ser and
Ser80Arg. Our result was consistent with those acquired in
previous studies (Bai et al., 2015; Bai et al., 2016). In addition to
GyrA and ParC mutations, the development of ﬂuoroquinolone
resistance was also relative to some penta-peptide repeat proteins
encoded by qnr, qepA, and oqxAB genes as well as aac(6(cid:48))-Ib
commonly harbored in the plasmids (Chen et al., 2012; Robicsek
et al., 2006). The detection rates of qnrB, oqxAB, and aac(6(cid:48))-
Ib in our study (22.8, 21.9, and 11.9%, respectively), are in
accordance with previously reported data (Chen et al., 2012;
Wang et al., 2003). Resistance to ﬂuoroquinolones in Salmonella
has occurred as a consequence of
the environmental and
clinical antibiotic usage, amino acid mutations, and emergence
of resistance genes (Chen et al., 2019). Despite the relatively
high detection rates of antibiotic-resistant isolates in PRTEM
samples, point mutations and antibiotic resistance genes were
not frequently detected in this study. Because the PRTEMs
we collected were pickled and stewed with large amounts of
salts, seasonings, and sauces, the stress in external environments
might have caused the Salmonella isolates to produce multidrug
resistance phenotypes.

Ten serotypes were identiﬁed in the 219 Salmonella isolates
recovered in this study, among which S. Thompson was the
most common serotype (37.9%, 83/219). This diﬀers from
previous data showing that S. Enteritidis, S. Senftenberg, and
S. Infantis were the predominant serotypes in RTE foods in
Thailand (Boonmar et al., 1998), in Henan Province of China
(Yu et al., 2014), and in Estonia (Kramarenko et al., 2014). With
exception of S. Thompson, S. Indiana (20.10%; 44/219) was also
detected in our study, and this serotype was ﬁrst reported in
the United States in 1955 (James and Carter, 1967), and has
not been commonly reported in other countries. However, in
China, S. Indiana has been more frequently detected annually
and predicted to be the second most common serotype in meat
products (Gong et al., 2017).

Surprisingly, 17 S. Typhi

isolates were recovered from
PRTEMs at the same sampling place (one of the wet markets)
across diﬀerent sampling times. To our knowledge, isolates of
this serotype are typically human-speciﬁc pathogens that can
cause enteric typhoid fever. S. Typhi isolates are commonly
recovered from food handlers (Everest et al., 2001; Gebreyesus
et al., 2014), water sources (Singh et al., 2015), dairy products
(Uzeh et al., 2010), fresh poultry meats (de Freitas et al., 2010),
and fresh fruit juice (Diana et al., 2012). No S. Typhi has
ever been detected from RTE foods such as PRTEM previously.
In general, S. Typhi cannot inhabit the gastrointestinal tract
of livestock; therefore, the contamination of human foods by
intestinal contents during domestic animal slaughter is not a
means of transmission to humans (Luby, 2014). Although we
did not further investigate the S. Typhi-positive PRTEM makers

for this pathogen, we considered that the following possibilities
might exist: (1) the PRTEM makers and/or vendors were S. Typhi
carriers. Thus, the foods were contaminated during processing
by direct contact with the carrier. (2) The water and/or PRTEM
processing environment were contaminated by S. Typhi. Thus,
the processed meats were likely contaminated by S. Typhi strains
that could survive in PRTEMs in the presence of adequate
nutrition for microbial growth.

According to the PFGE ﬁngerprints of Salmonella isolates for
several of the most commonly detected serotypes, Salmonella
isolates of each serotype had a very close genetic relationship in
PRTEMs during the sampling period, or that they had existed
in each of the PRTEM processing environments for a long
period. Although these isolates were from diﬀerent samples
across various sampling places and times, they shared the same
or very similar DNA proﬁles, antibiotic resistance phenotypes,
and even some antibiotic resistance genes. This phenomenon was
also observed for some isolates derived from diﬀerent food types.
Our result indicated that the prevalence of Salmonella in PRTEMs
could be potential hazards to consumers and would result in
Salmonella outbreaks in certain time periods.

This

study revealed that Salmonella was prevalent
in
commercial PRTEMs at high concentrations. Some of
the
Salmonella isolates recovered from same or diﬀerent types
of PRTEM sheared same or very similar PFGE proﬁles,
antibiotic resistance proﬁles, QRDR mutations and antibiotic
resistance genes. Since PRTEM is a type of RTE food and is
generally consumed without re-cooking, the presence of high
concentrations of multidrug resistant Salmonella is a tremendous
public health threat to both food safety and human health.
