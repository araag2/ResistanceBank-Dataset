Shiga  toxin-producing  Escherichia  coli  (STEC)  and  enterotoxigenic  E.  coli  (ETEC)  are 
important  causes  of  diarrhea  in  humans  and  animals  worldwide.  Although  ruminant 
animals  are  the  main  source  of  STEC,  diarrhea  due  to  this  pathotype  is  very  low  in 
Bangladesh  where  ETEC  remains  the  predominant  group  associated  with  childhood 
diarrhea. In the present study, E. coli strains (n = 35) isolated from Bangladesh livestock 
(goats, sheep, and cattle) and poultry (chicken and ducks) were analyzed for the pres-
ence  of  major  virulence  factors,  such  as  Shiga  toxins  (STX-1  and  STX-2),  heat-labile 
toxin, and heat-stable toxins (STa and STb). Multiplex polymerase chain reaction results 
revealed 23 (66%) E. coli strains to be virulent possessing either sta (n = 5), stx (stx1, 
n = 8; stx2, n = 2), or both (n = 8) genes in varying combinations. Thirty-four percent 
(8/23)  of  strains  from  livestock  were  hybrid  type  that  carried  both  stx  (either  stx1  or 
stx2) and ETEC-specific enterotoxin gene sta. Serotyping results revealed that the ETEC 
strains  belonged  to  five  serotypes,  namely  O36:H5,  O174:H−,  O152:H8,  O109:H51, 
and O8:H21, while the STEC-producing strains belonged to serotypes O76:H19 (n = 3), 
O43:H2  (n =  2),  O87:H16  (n =  2),  OR:H2  (n =  1),  O110:H16  (n =  1),  and  O152:H8 
(n = 1). The STEC–ETEC hybrid strains belonged to serotypes O76:H19 (n = 3), O43:H2 
(n = 2), O87:H16, OR:H2, and O152:H8. Forty percent (2/5) of the ETEC and 20% (2/10) 
of the STEC strains were multidrug resistant with the highest drug resistance (50%) being 
found in the hybrid strains. Molecular fingerprinting determined by pulsed-field gel elec-
trophoresis and cluster analyses by dendrogram revealed that, genetically, STEC–ETEC 
hybrid strains were highly heterogeneous. Multidrug-resistant E. coli STEC–ETEC hybrid 
strains in domesticated animals pose a public health threat for humans in Bangladesh.

Escherichia  coli  is  commonly  regarded  as  a  non-pathogenic 
beneficial  inhabitant  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract  but  several 
pathogenic  strains  acquired  specific  virulence  factors  that 
are accountable for a variety of intestinal and extra intestinal 
diseases, including diarrhea, acute inflammation, hemorrhagic 
colitis, urinary tract infections, septicemia, and neonatal men-
ingitis  (1–4).  Based  on  virulence  traits,  major  diarrheagenic 
E. coli pathogroups include shigatoxigenic E. coli, enterotoxi-
genic E. coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli, enteroinvasive 
E. coli, and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) (3). Shiga toxin-
producing  E.  coli  (STEC)  is  a  pathogen  of  significant  public 
health  concern  and  infection  by  this  strain  can  result  in  a 
spectrum  of  outcomes  ranging  from  asymptomatic  carriage 
to severe diarrhea, as well as bloody diarrhea and hemolytic-
uremic  syndrome  (HUS)  (5).  The  disease  causing  ability  of 
STEC  is  associated  with  the  production  of  phage-encoded 
Shiga-like  toxins  (Stx),  which  are  classified  into  two  major 
families,  Stx1  and  Stx2  (encoded  by  stx1  and  stx2  genes)  on 
the basis of toxin neutralization assays and sequence analysis 
of stx genes. ETEC is the leading cause of diarrhea in travelers 
from industrialized countries and children living in low-income 
countries.  ETEC  bacteria  are  largely  defined  by  the  presence 
of  the  plasmid-encoded  heat-labile  (LT)  and/or  heat-stable  
(STa/STb) toxins (3).

Ruminants,  especially  cattle,  sheep,  and  goat  are  the  main 
source of STEC for humans and play an important role in the 
epidemiology of human infections (6). Meat contamination can 
facilitate transmission of pathogenic E. coli occurring through 
unhygienic slaughtering and poor food handling. Screening and 
characterization of animal STEC helps to identify the origin of 
human STEC infections. Despite the fact that over 400 STEC 
serotypes have been identified, only a subset of these have been 
correlated to human illness (7). Most outbreaks of hemorrhagic 
colitis and HUS have been associated with STEC O157 strains 
(5). There are outbreaks reported that are caused by non-O157 
(8); infections caused by some non-O157 serotypes have also 
been  frequently  associated  with  severe  illness  in  humans.  In 
some  geographic  areas,  STEC  non-O157  strains  are  more 
commonly isolated than STEC O157 strains from persons with 
diarrhea or HUS (9). Antimicrobial resistance patterns may be 
an additional epidemiological marker for surveys of non-O157 
SETC (10).

In human, ETEC strains are associated with one of the most 
frequent (sometimes fatal) causes of childhood diarrhea in the 
developing countries and an important causative agent of trave-
ler’s diarrhea (3). ETEC is also a major cause of severe diarrheal 
disease in suckling and weanling animals (11). ETEC infections 
are transmitted through the fecal–oral route. Exposure to ETEC 
usually comes from contaminated food and drinking water (3). A 
close genetic relationship has been found between ETEC strains 
belonging to certain serotypes with diarrhea, which suggest that 
serotype  analysis  can  be  coupled  with  genetic  typing  to  study 
strain  clustering  in  epidemiologic  and  pathogenic  studies.  To 
assess the potential public health risk posed by ETEC and STEC, 
the  detection  of  virulence  factors,  such  as  heat-stable  toxin  a 

(STa), heat-stable toxin b (STb), heat-labile toxin (LT), stx1, and 
stx2, is recommended (12–16).

Shigatoxigenic  E.  coli  and  other  diarrheagenic  E.  coli  are 
capable of acquiring virulence and related genes via horizontal 
gene transfer leading to the development of pathogroups differ-
ent from the pre-existing ones (17). Such divergent pathogroups 
are often reported using different terminology such as “hybrid” 
(18), “blended virulence profiles,” and “virulence combination” 
(19). Several studies have reported coexisting STEC- and ETEC-
associated virulence genes in E. coli strains of human, animal, and 
environmental origins (17, 20–25). The notorious sprout-borne 
outbreak  strain  O104:H4  in  Germany  possessed  EAEC-  and 
STEC-associated virulence genes (18) pointing to the possibil-
ity of extremely pathogenic strains emerging over a short time 
period (26).

In Bangladesh, the prevalence of STEC in hospitalized patients 
with  diarrhea  is  very  low  (0.5%)  (27),  but  it  was  somewhat 
higher  among  community  cases  with  diarrhea  (1.9%)  (27).  In 
Bangladesh,  the  predominant  group  of  E.  coli  associated  with 
childhood diarrhea is ETEC, which accounts for approximately 
20% of all diarrheal cases (28). Animals seem to be the potential 
carrier for pathogenic E. coli but there is little data available con-
cerning animal reservoirs, epidemiology, human pathogenicity, 
and drug resistance profiles of STEC and ETEC in Bangladesh. In 
the present study, we report the existence of multidrug-resistant 
E. coli strains belonging to STEC, ETEC, and a newly emerged 
STEC–ETEC  hybrid  in  domesticated  animals,  which  pose  a 
potential public health threat for humans in Bangladesh.

sample collection, isolation, and 
identification of E. coli
Rectal (livestock) and cloacal (bird) samples were collected from 
a  total  of  35  different  livestock  [goat  (n =  19),  sheep  (n =  9), 
cattle (n = 2)] and poultry [chicken (n = 3) and duck (n = 2)] 
between June and August 2007 from the district of Mymensingh, 
Bangladesh. Sterile cotton swabs were used for the collection of 
rectal  and  cloacal  samples.  After  collection,  the  cotton  swabs 
were  dipped  into  Carry-Blair  media  and  stored  in  a  cool  box 
(4°C). Immediately after sampling, all samples were transported 
to  the  laboratory  for  analysis.  All  samples  were  streaked  onto 
MacConkey agar (Difco), and the plates were incubated overnight 
at 37°C. Bright pink lactose-fermenting colonies were selected as 
presumptive E. coli. These colonies were again grown on eosin 
methylene blue agar to examine for the production green colonies 
with a metallic sheen. One presumptive colony per sample was 
identified by biochemical tests, as described before (29).

Polymerase chain reaction (Pcr) 
amplification of Virulence genes
DNA was extracted from isolated colonies suggestive of E. coli, 
as described previously (30). The samples were then subjected to 
molecular analysis of ETEC (sta, stb, elt) and STEC (stx1, stx2) 
virulence genes using multiplex PCR. The PCR assay conditions 
are described in Table 1. Each amplification was conducted in a

volume of 20 µl containing the following reagents: 1 µl template 
DNA,  0.5  µl  dNTP  (Invitrogen,  Carlsbad,  CA,  USA)  solution 
(10 mmol 1−1), 1.0 µl of each primer at 5 pmol l−1, 0.6 µl Taq 
DNA polymerase solution (Invitrogen) (1.5 U μl−1), 2.0 µl PCR 
reaction buffer solution (10×) with 0.8 µl MgCl2 (50 mmol l−1), 
and presterilized ultrapure water (Milli-Q) to 20 µl. This mixture 
was processed in a thermocycler at 94°C for 4 min (denaturation), 
followed by 30 cycles at 94°C for 1 min (denaturation), annealing 
temperature (specific for each primer) for 1 min (binding), and 
at 72°C for 1.5 min (extension). Complete extension of the Taq 
DNA polymerase was performed at 72°C for 7 min. An aliquot of 
this reaction containing only water without DNA was used as a 
negative control. Two multiplex PCR tests were carried out; one 
for the primer set LT, STa, and STb and the other for the primer 
set Stx1 and Stx2.

serotyping
The  rabbit  antisera  against  O1  to  O187strains  were  prepared 
in  rabbits  (SERUNAM)  according  to  procedures  described  by 
Ewing (31). The E. coli O1 to O172 strains were obtained from 
the  Laboratory  of  Gastrointestinal  Pathogens,  Department  of 
Gastrointestinal, Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, Centre for 
Infections, Health Protection Agency, London, UK, and the E. coli 
O173 to O186 strains (32) were obtained from the Statens Serum 
Institute, Copenhagen.

The strains were serotyped by agglutination assay (33) using 
96-well micro titer plates and rabbit serum (SERUNAM) obtained 
against 187 somatic antigens and 53 flagellar antigens for E. coli.

antibiotic susceptibility
Susceptibility to antibiotics was performed by disk diffusion, as 
described by Bauer et al. (34) and the Clinical and Laboratory 
Standards  Institute  (35)  (CLSI),  using  commercial  antibiotic 
discs.  Thirteen  antibiotics  (Oxoid,  UK)  were  employed:  eryth-
romycin  (E,  15  µg);  gentamicin  (CN,  10  µg);  trimethoprim/
sulfamethoxazole (SXT, 30 µg), tetracycline (TE, 30 µg), ampicil-
lin (AMP, 30 µg), streptomycin (S, 10 µg), azithromycin (AZM, 
15  µg),  nalidixic  acid  (NA,  30  µg),  ciprofloxacin  (CIP,  5  µg), 
ceftriaxone  (CRO,  30  µg),  cefixime  (CFM,  5  µg),  mecillinam 
(MEL,  25  µg),  and  cephalothin  (KF,  30  µg).  Characterizations 
of  the  resistance  or  susceptibility  profiles  of  the  isolates  were 

determined by measuring the inhibitory zone and comparing it 
with an established interpretative chart to determine sensitivity 
to each antibiotic.

Pulsed-Field gel electrophoresis (PFge)
Whole agarose-embedded genomic DNA from the E. coli isolates 
was prepared. PFGE was carried out using a contour-clamped 
homogeneous electrical field (CHEF-DRII) apparatus (Bio-Rad), 
according to procedures described previously (36). Genomic DNA 
of the test strains and Salmonella enterica serovar Braenderup was 
digested using XbaI, with fragments employed as molecular size 
markers.  Restriction  fragments  were  separated  in  1%  pulsed-
field-certified agarose in 0.5× TBE (Tris–borate–EDTA) buffer. 
Post-electrophoresis  gel  treatment  included  both  gel-staining 
and  de-staining.  The  DNA  was  visualized  using  a  UV  transil-
luminator, and images were digitized via a one-dimensional gel 
documentation system (Bio-Rad).

PFge analysis
The fingerprint pattern in the gel was analyzed using a computer 
software package, Bionumeric (Applied Maths, Belgium, version 
3.1).  After  background  subtraction  and  gel  normalization,  the 
fingerprint  patterns  were  typed  according  to  banding  similar-
ity  and  dissimilarity,  using  the  Dice  similarity  coefficient  and 
unweighted-pair  group  method  employing  average  linkage 
(UPGMA) clustering, as recommended by the manufacturer. The 
results were graphically represented as dendrograms.

Phenotypic characteristics of E. coli
All the E. coli strains (n = 35) included in this study produced 
bright  pink  colonies  on  MacConkey  and  green  colonies  with 
metallic sheen on EMB agar plates. All strains gave biochemical 
reactions typical of E. coli.

Virulence gene Profile
Among the 35 E. coli strains isolated from livestock and poultry 
in the present study, 23 (66%) (goats: 17, sheep: 4, chicken: 1, and 
ducks: 1) carried virulence genes, such as, sta and stx, either stx1 
or stx2, but did not carry stb or elt genes, as confirmed by PCR

(Table 2). Of the 23 strains carrying toxin genes, 5 (22%) had sta, 
and 10 (44%) had stx genes. Of the 10 E. coli carrying stx gene, 
8 (80%) harbored only stx1, and 2 (20%) had only stx2. Eight 
of the 23 (34%) toxigenic strains were hybrid of which 7 (88%) 
possessed both sta and stx1, while the remaining strain carried 
both sta and stx2 (Table 2). None of the strains tested presented 
elt or stb.

serotyping of E. coli
Based on serotyping, the 23 toxigenic E. coli strains belonged to 
10 different O serogroups [O8 (n = 1), O36 (n = 1), O43 (n = 4), 
O76 (n = 6), O87 (n = 3), O109 (n = 1), O110 (n = 1), O152 
(n = 3), O174 (n = 1), and OR (n = 2)] and 8 different H seo-
groups [H2 (n = 6), H5 (n = 1), H8 (n = 3), H16 (n = 4), H19 
(n = 6), H21 (n = 1), H51 (n = 1), and H− (n = 1)]. E. coli strains 
carrying  virulence  genes  belonged  to  10  different  serotypes: 
O36:H5 (n = 1), O43:H2 (n = 4), O76:H19 (n = 6), O87:H16 
(n = 3), O174: H− (n = 1), OR: H2 (n = 2), O110:H16 (n = 1), 
O152:H8 (n = 3), O109:H51 (n = 1), and O8:H21 (n = 1). None 
of the tested strains belonged to the EHEC serogroup, as they 
did not agglutinate with the antisera specific for O157 (Table 2). 
The ETEC strains (n = 5) belonged to five different serotypes: 
O36:H5,  O174:  H−,  O152:H8,  O109:H51,  and  O8:H21,  while 
the  STEC  strains  (n =  10)  belonged  to  six  different  serotypes: 
O76:H19 (30%), O43:H2 (20%), O87:H16 (20%), OR: H2 (10%), 
O110:H16 (10%), and O152:H8 (10%) (Figure 1). In the order of 

prevalence of the STEC–ETEC hybrid strains (n = 8), O76:H19 
was  the  most  prevalent  (37.5%)  serotype,  followed  by  O43:H2 
(25%), O87:H16 (12.5%), OR: H2 (12.5%), and O152:H8 (12.5%) 
(Figure 1).

antibiotic assay
Antibiotic susceptibility assay was performed for the 23 toxigenic 
strains only, and the results showed 87% of the strains to be resist-
ant to erythromycin, 43% to azithromycin, 22% to streptomycin, 
22%  to  trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole,  17%  to  cephalothin, 
9% to ciprofloxacin, 9% to nalidixic acid, and 4% to tetracycline 
(Table 2). All E. coli strains were sensitive to gentamicin, ampicil-
lin, ceftriaxone, cefixime, and mecillinam. Results also revealed 
40% (2/5) of the ETEC and 20% (2/10) of the STEC strains to be 
multidrug resistant (MDR) showing resistance to erythromycin, 
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole,  azithromycin,  cephalothin, 
ciprofloxacin, and nalidixic acid. The highest MDR was found in 
the hybrid strains, accounting for 50% (4/8) (Table 2), although 
the strains varied in their patterns of response to the different 
drugs tested.

Overall drug response results revealed 11 different resistance 
patterns among the three pathogroups of E. coli (ETEC, STEC, 
and hybrids of STEC–ETEC). Resistance patterns I (ER, SR), II 
(ER, AZMR), III (ER, SXTR, AZMR, KFR), and IV (ER, CIPR, SXTR, 
NAR, AZMR) were found in ETEC; resistance patterns V (ER), VI 
(ER, AZMR, SR, KFR), and VII (ER, SXTR, AZMR, SR) in STEC; and

PFge and cluster analysis
The XbaI-digested genomic DNAs of the E. coli strains carrying 
virulence genes from animal and poultry were subjected to PFGE 
to determine genetic relatedness and clonal origin. The number 
of fragments generated by restriction digestion with XbaI varied 
between  14  and  19,  and  the  molecular  size  of  the  fragments 
ranged from 30 to 600 kb. Diverse PFGE patterns obtained from 
the 23 toxigenic E. coli strains (Figure 2) belonged to multiple

coli strains exhibited high genetic heterogeneity in the PFGE pat-
terns, four hybrid strains belonging to serotype O76:H19 formed 
a small tight cluster, suggesting that genetically, they are closely 
related.

Occurrence of hybrid of sTec and eTec 
strains
Enterotoxigenic E. coli and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) 
are  notorious  pathogens  associated  with  severe  diarrhea  and 

HUS  in  humans.  Although  E.  coli  constitutes  an  important 
component  of  normal  gut  bacterial  flora,  many  studies  have 
shown the non-toxigenic strains to harbor a number of different 
virulence factors and to be diarrheagenic (17, 18, 37). Here, we 
present data showing the prevalence of E. coli strains carrying

an ETEC-specific gene, sta, and STEC-specific gene, stx, which 
included either stx1 or stx2 in the gut of livestock and poultry in 
Bangladesh. This study also presents data showing for the first 
time that a significant proportion (8/23) of the toxigenic E. coli 
strains from livestock were MDR and hybrid type carrying both 
stx (either stx1 or stx2) and ETEC-specific enterotoxin gene, sta. 
The presence of such a high percentage of MDR hybrid type E. 
coli strains in livestock poses a potential health threat to people 
of Bangladesh.

Virulence gene Profiling of E. coli strains
Results  obtained  in  this  study  confirmed  that  a  very  high 
proportion  of  the  E.  coli  strains  (66%)  deriving  from  differ-
ent  livestock  are  toxigenic,  carrying  either  sta,  stx,  or  both  in 
varying combinations. What is most important to note is that 
a significant proportion of E. coli in livestock was confirmed to 
be ETEC, including 22% carrying the sta gene only, 44% STEC 
(harboring only stx gene; either stx1 or stx2), and 35% hybrid 
comprising both est and stx. ETEC is an important cause of diar-
rhea in humans and animals in the low-income countries and is 
the main cause of diarrhea in travelers to low-income countries 
(1). One study carried out in Spain reported a high incidence of 
ETEC (30%) in piglets with diarrhea (38). A study carried out 
in Bangladesh revealed 61% of the E. coli strains isolated from 
the  aquatic  environment  carried  the  est  gene  (39).  Zoonotic 
and environmental transmission may be the reason ETEC is the 
predominant group of E. coli associated with childhood diarrhea 

in Bangladesh (28). The occurrence of ETEC in farm animals 
has  always  been  of  great  public  health  importance  as  animals 
excreting pathogenic bacteria can contaminate water bodies in 
and around the area they are reared and in many ways can be 
related to human diseases. This may be one reason why ETEC is 
largely a pathogen of low-income countries where access to safe 
drinking water is often low.

STEC strains can cause bloody diarrhea known as haemor-
rhagic  colitis,  non-bloody  diarrhea,  and  HUS  (1).  The  data 
presented  in  this  study  provide  evidence  that  livestock  is  an 
important  reservoir  for  STEC  carrying  either  stx1  or  stx2.  A 
study  carried  out  in  Bangladesh  reported  37.9%  of  buffalo, 
20.1% of cows, and 10.0% of goats were positive for STEC (40). 
Our data appear to concur with 44% (n = 10) of livestock E. coli 
isolated  mostly  from  goats  (80%,  8/10  or  35%,  8/23)  revealed 
STEC, either stx1 or stx2. Our results also appear to agree with 
those from a study carried out in Vietnam that showed STEC to 
account for 27% of E. coli isolated from buffalos, 23% from cattle, 
and 38.5% from goats (41). Although water plays an important 
role in the transmission of pathogenic bacteria, a study carried 
out  in  Bangladesh  reported  the  presence  of stx  only  in  1.25% 
of the E. coli strains isolated from natural aquatic environments 
(39).  STEC-associated  diarrhea  is  also  very  low  compared  to 
that  of  other  enteric  pathogens,  including Vibrio  cholerae  and 
ETEC in Bangladesh (27). This low prevalence of STEC as the 
etiology of diarrhea could be due to STEC-specific antibodies 
in the human population, as this pathotype is present in a high

proportion of E. coli occurring in domesticated livestock, such 
as goats and sheep, although it was not found in poultry, and 
only  rarely  in  surface  water  samples  (39).  The  low  prevalence 
in natural surface water could be related to the incompetence 
of the STEC strains to survive beyond their livestock reservoirs 
(cattle, sheep, and goats) (6). Despite the low prevalence of STEC 
infections in Bangladesh (27), the virulence potential of these 
livestock strains to emerge as a novel STEC pathogen cannot be 
ruled out.

In the present study, 34% of the toxigenic livestock E. coli 
strains were hybrid as those carried toxin genes present in two 
different pathotypes; stx and est. Notably, majority of these hybrid 
strains (7/8) carried both sta and stx 1, while one strain carried 
both sta and stx2 genes. This finding is not unique to our study 
as a number of past studies have shown hybrid strains carrying 
virulence marker genes of two different E. coli pathotypes (17), 
nonetheless, in a significantly lower frequency (2%) than that we 
observed in Bangladesh. Clinically linked STEC–ETEC hybrid 
E. coli strains from Brazil, Denmark, France, Germany, Great 
Britain, Mexico, and the United States were shown to harbor 
virulence  markers  for  two  or  three  different  pathotypes  (17). 
In a study in Germany, 0.6% of the human STEC isolates pos-
sessed stx2g and estIa (37). Serotype O100:H of a STEC–ETEC 
hybrid strain carrying stx2 and estIa genes was isolated from 
contaminated  drinking  water  during  an  outbreak  in  Finland 
(22). A later study reported a STEC strain carrying stx1a and 
estIa from cattle in Burkina Faso (42). Although no data exist on 
the virulence potential of STEC–ETEC hybrid strains isolated 
from livestock in Bangladesh, the widespread distribution and 
clinical  relevance  worldwide  might  indicate  their  virulence 
potential.

serodiversity
In the present study, serotyping results revealed that the ETEC 
strains belonged to five different serotypes: O36:H5, O174:H−, 
O152:H8,  O109:H51,  and  O8:H21.  No  sero-specificity  was 
observed  for  these  ETEC  strains  as  there  was  no  relationship 
between the serotypes and the type of toxin genes (st or lt) they 
possessed. Likewise, the STEC strains belonged to six different 
serotypes (O76:H19, O43:H2, O87:H16, OR: H2, O110:H16, and 
O152:H8); STEC O157:H7 serotype was not present among the 
tested strains. Moreover, the STEC serotypes did not belong to 
any of the serotypes of the big six groups (O26, O45, O103, O111, 
O121,  and  O145)  in  the  present  study  (43).  STEC  non-O157 
isolates  have  been  shown  to  be  important  pathogens  despite 
having  been  underreported  because  in  many  laboratories,  the 
facilities to isolate, identify, and characterize this pathotype do 
not  exist  (40).  One  report  suggested  that  some  non-O157:H7 
STEC strains cause human illness and likely account for 20–50% 
of STEC infections (an estimated 37,000 cases) annually in the 
United States (44). In our study, we have identified eight E. coli 
strains  that  were  hybrids  and  carried  virulence  genes  STEC–
ETEC, which are largely restricted to five serotypes (O76:H19, 
O43:H2,  O87:H16,  OR:  H2,  and  O152:H8).  Several  other 
studies  reported  STEC–ETEC  hybrid  strains;  however,  unlike 
our  study,  the  serotypes  were  O2:H27,  O101:H−,  O15:H16, 
O74:H28, O116:H28, O128:H8, O136:H12, O141:H8, O168:H8, 

OX182:H16, OX182:H− in Finland (23), O139, O149, O116, and 
OSB9 in Japan (24), O100:H− in United States (21), and O2:H2 
in Burkina Faso (42).

antibiotic resistance Profile
Resistance to antimicrobial agents can be a useful epidemiologi-
cal marker for ETEC, STEC, and STEC–ETEC hybrid strains. In 
this study, the highest antimicrobial resistance was found against 
erythromycin  87%  (20/23)  followed  by  azithromycin  43% 
(10/23). In the present study, a significant proportion of ETEC 
and STEC strains were MDR with the highest MDR [50% (4/8)] 
being observed in STEC–ETEC hybrid strains. Since 1950s, anti-
biotics have been used in animal feed to ensure healthy livestock, 
prevent infections, and excel growth. Such indiscriminate use of 
antibiotics resulted in the widespread antibiotic resistance in bac-
teria (21). Erythromycin resistance during the 1990s compelled 
clinicians to switch to azithromycin as the drug of choice in the 
treatment  of  cholera  (45)  and  watery  (cholera-like)  diarrhea 
caused by ETEC (46, 47).

PFge analysis
As  shown  earlier  by  Vu-Khac  et  al.  (48),  a  high  degree  of 
genetic  polymorphisms  was  observed  from  the  PFGE  profiles 
of the STEC non-O157 and ETEC strains in the present study. 
Similarly, a high degree of heterogeneity was also observed with 
the STEC–ETEC hybrid strains, as the pulsotypes were different 
for strains belonging to the same serotypes, suggesting that they 
were  unlikely  to  be  of  a  single  ancestral  origin.  A  few  strains 
showing identical PFGE patterns, however, suggest close clonal 
relatedness.

cOnclUsiOn

This  study  is  the  first  to  show  livestock  as  the  reservoir  
for  multidrug  resistant  hybrid  type  E.  coli  strains  carrying 
both stx and st found in Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) 
and  ETEC,  respectively,  in  Bangladesh.  Serotyping  results 
revealed that none of the E. coli STEC–ETEC hybrid strains 
were  O157:H7  but  belonged  to  serotypes  O76:H19,  O43:H2, 
O87:H16,  OR:H2,  and  O152:H8  and  were  heterogeneous 
genetically as confirmed by PFGE of XbaI-digested genomic 
DNA  and  cluster  analyses  by  dendrogram.  Although  there 
may be some sorts of immunity toward Shiga toxin-producing 
E.  coli  existing  among  the  healthy  human  population  of  
Bangladesh (49), as they live in close proximity to the domes-
ticated  animals,  multidrug  resistant  STEC–ETEC  hybrid  E. 
coli strains occurring in domesticated animals deserve careful 
attention as they can pose even greater public health threat for 
the people of Bangladesh.
