The objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence and ﬂuoroquinolone
resistant Salmonella isolated from an integrated broiler chicken supply chain and their
molecular characterization. In total, 73 Salmonella isolates were recovered from a broiler
chicken supply chain in Shanghai. Salmonella isolates were tested for susceptibility to
11 antimicrobial agents using the broth dilution method and were characterized using
pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Then, the Salmonella isolates were examined for
mutations in quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of gyrA, gyrB, parC, and
parE, and were screened for plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes.
Lastly, we sequenced the plasmids carrying qnrS1 in six Salmonella isolates from
three sources (two isolated per source). Among 73 Salmonella isolates, 45 isolates
were identiﬁed as S. Indiana, 24 were S. Schwarzengrund, 2 were S. Enteritidis, and
2 were S. Stanleyville. In addition, high rates of resistance were detected for nalidixic
acid (41.1%) and ciproﬂoxacin (37.0%), while resistance to other test agents was
diverse (2.0–100%). S. Indiana and S. Schwarzengrund isolates from different sources
exhibited the same PFGE pattern, suggesting that the Salmonella isolates possessed
high potential to spread along the broiler chicken supply chain. gyrA and parC exhibited
frequent missense mutations. Moreover, qnrS1 was the most prevalent PMQR gene in
the 73 Salmonella isolates, and it was found about a new hybrid plasmid. This study
concludes a high prevalence of ﬂuoroquinolone resistant Salmonella in chicken supply
chain, threatening the treatment of Salmonella foodborne diseases. In particular, the
emergence of a new hybrid plasmid carrying qnrS1 indicates that the recombination of
plasmid carrying resistance gene might be a potential risk factor for the prevention and
control strategies of drug resistance.

Characterization of Fluoroquinolone Resistant Salmonella

INTRODUCTION

is one of

Salmonellosis, caused by Salmonella,
the most
frequently reported foodborne illnesses worldwide. Salmonella is
divided into more than 2500 serovars by the White–Kauﬀman
and Le Minor scheme. This classiﬁcation scheme deﬁnes the
serogroup according to expression of somatic lipopolysaccharide
O antigens, and the serovar by the expression of ﬂagellar H
antigens. Salmonella, as an important human pathogen, is a
potential public health risk.

It has been estimated that Salmonella causes about 1.2 million
illnesses in the United States every year. Food is a major
source of these infections, accounting for 1 million illnesses,
19,336 hospitalizations, and 378 deaths (Scallan et al., 2011).
The majority of human infections caused by Salmonella is
associated with the consumption of food products. Chicken,
as one of the most widely consumed meats, is an important
reservoir of Salmonella (Adu-Gyamﬁ et al., 2012; Truong Ha and
Yamaguchi, 2012). Importantly, antibiotic-resistant bacteria of
animal origin could be transmitted to humans (Piddock, 2002;
Khemtong and Chuanchuen, 2008), which adversely aﬀect the
treatment of salmonellosis. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor
the epidemiology and genetic characteristics of Salmonella
in the food chain.

Fluoroquinolones are widely used to treat salmonellosis
in human and animal
(Folster et al., 2015). Currently,
the main mechanism underlying quinolone resistance is the
accumulation of mutations in quinolone resistance-determining
region (QRDR) of gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE and plasmid-
mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR), which includes ﬁve
major groups of qnr determinants (qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrD,
and qnrS), aac(6(cid:48))-Ib-cr and quinolone extrusion such as qepA
and oqxAB (Strahilevitz et al., 2009). Some studies focused on
ﬂuoroquinolone resistance-related determinants about PMQR
and QRDR in Salmonella derived from humans and animals
(Wasyl et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2014). However, comprehensive
data regarding ﬂuoroquinolone resistance determinants
in
Salmonella from chicken supply chain are lacking, despite the
implication for human health.

Thus, the aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence
of Salmonella and their molecular characteristics related to
ﬂuoroquinolone resistance determinants, including PMQR and
QRDR, in the broiler chicken supply chain in Shanghai. These
data provide insight
into the quantitative risk of resistant
Salmonella from chicken supply chain.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Statement of Ethics
This study was carried out in accordance with the ethical
guide lines of
the College of Veterinary Medicine, China
Agricultural University, Beijing. Moreover, before the initiation
of this study, formal approval was obtained by the departmental
committee of institute. Sampling was carried according to the
standard protocols and with prior consent of the farmer/manager
of the facilities.

Salmonella Strains and Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Testing
Salmonella isolates were recovered from three sources including
adult broilers, broiler carcasses and retail chicken, representing
vertically integrated commercial broiler chicken supply chain
in Shanghai City, China. One sample was collected from
each animal or meat product as appropriate. Caecal samples
from adult broilers were randomly collected at the abattoir.
Whole carcasses or meat samples were aseptically obtained from
chicken processing chain. Carcasses from the retail chicken
source were sampled from the markets. All samples were
immediately transported to the laboratory in an insulated ice
boxes containing ice packs. Microbiological procedures were
performed immediately upon arrival at
the laboratory. All
test strains were isolated in CHROMagar Salmonella agar
(CHROMagar Company, Paris, France). Suspected Salmonella
colonies were conﬁrmed by a PCR assay targeting the invA gene
(Rahn et al., 1992). Salmonella serotyping was conducted by
performing the slide agglutination test, using Salmonella antisera
(S & A Reagents Lab Ltd., Bangkok, Thailand) according to
manufacturer’s instructions.

The DNA templates of isolates were prepared using TIANamp
Bacteria DNA Reagent Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China). The
extracted DNAs were ampliﬁed by PCR assay. The mutations
in gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE genes were analyzed as described
previously (Eaves et al., 2004). Salmonella isolates were screened
for oqxA, oqxB, qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrD, qnrS, aac(6(cid:48))-Ib-cr,
and qepA genes. The primers and ampliﬁcation conditions were
described previously (Chen et al., 2012). PCR products were
sequenced and identiﬁed.

carrying qnrS1 were randomly selected from three sources (two
isolates per source) for analysis by S1-PFGE and Southern
hybridization, as previously described (Zhang et al., 2015). For
the conjugation assay, six selected Salmonella isolates were
used as donor strains, and sodium azide-resistant E. coli J53
was used as recipient strains. Both the donor strain and
recipient strain were mixed on Luria-Bertani agar at a ratio of
1:3, and 100 µL mixtures were incubated for 16 h at 37◦C.
Transconjugants were selected on LB supplemented with sodium
azide (100 mg/L) and ciproﬂoxacin (0.5 mg/L). Plasmids DNA
were extracted from six Salmonella isolates transconjugants

shows the distribution of ﬂuoroquinolone resistance genes (oqxA,
oqxB, qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrD, qnrS, aac (6(cid:48))-Ib-cr, and qepA).
Among them, qnrS1 (30/73) was predominant gene, following
by qnrB1 (22/73), oqxA (1/73), oqxB (1/73), and aac (6(cid:48))-Ib-cr
(1/73). The genes sequences of qnrS1, qnrB1, oqxA, oqxB, and aac
(6(cid:48))-Ib-cr were deposited in GenBank. Accession numbers were
MK990505, MK990506, MK990507, MK990508, and MK990509,
respectively. However, the other ﬂuoroquinolone resistance genes
were not observed. In total, 53 of 73 Salmonella isolates
carried ﬂuoroquinolone resistance genes, and qnrS1 gene was
detected in most S. Indiana (23/45), S. Schwarzengrund (5/22),
and S. Enteritidis (2/2) isolates, accounting for the majority
Salmonella isolates in the broiler supply chain.

RESULTS

Prevalence and Characteristics of
Salmonella Isolates in the Chicken
Supply Chain
A total of 73 (7.7%) Salmonella isolates were recovered from
715 samples. The highest prevalence of (17.5%, 48 isolates)
detected in 200 broiler carcass samples, followed by 127 retail
chicken samples (8.7%, 16 isolates), while lowest prevalence
(2.3%, 9 isolates) of Salmonella isolates was observed in 388
adult broiler samples. Among these, 45 isolates were identiﬁed
as S. Indiana, 24 were S. Schwarzengrund, 2 were S. Enteritidis,
and 2 were S. Stanleyville. Furthermore, all 73 Salmonella isolates
were evaluated for susceptibilities to eleven antibiotics. The
rates of resistance were 41.1% for nalidixic acid and 37.0%
for ciproﬂoxacin, while, resistance to other test agents varied
substantially (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid: 43.8%, ampicillin:
42.5%, cefazolin: 47.9%, doxycycline: 95.9%, gentamicin: 6.8%,
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: 100%, chloramphenicol: 43.8%,
meropenem: 2.0%, and ceftriaxone: 12.3%). PFGE proﬁles are
shown in Figure 1. Notably, some S. Indiana isolates from
diﬀerent sources exhibited the same PFGE pattern. Likewise,
some S. Schwarzengrund exhibited the same PFGE pattern,
suggesting that Salmonella isolates have high potential to spread
along the broiler chicken supply chain.

Fluoroquinolone Resistance
Determinants in the Chicken
Supply Chain
Based on the detail information in Supplementary Table S1,
mutations within QRDR of gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE are
summarized in terms of serotype in Table 1 The presented data
indicated that missense mutations frequently occurred in gyrA
and parC, whereas silent mutations were observed in gyrA, gyrB,
parC, and parE. Among 73 Salmonella isolates from this broiler
chicken supply chain, 47 Salmonella isolates carried the wild-type
(no mutation) within gyrA gene, missense mutation (Thr57Ser)
within parC gene, 15 of which did not exhibit implicated
in ﬂuoroquinolone resistance phenotypes. The remaining 26
isolates contained missense mutations within gyrA (Ser83Phe and

Novel Plasmid Associated With qnrS1
The qnrS1 was predominant gene in the chicken supply chain,
thus, six Salmonella isolates from three sources (two isolates
per source) were randomly selected to analyze the transmission
mechanism of qnrS1 according to the PFGE proﬁle. S1-PFGE
and Southern blot analyses (Figure 2) indicated that qnrS1 is
located on a ∼40 kb plasmid, designated pSH-01. Conjugation
experiments by ﬁlter mating revealed that qnrS1 could be co-
transferred from Salmonella isolates to E. coli J53. S1-PFGE and
Southern hybridization conﬁrmed that the DNA probes speciﬁc
for qnrS1 hybridized to the same plasmids with a size ∼40 kb
in both Salmonella isolates and their transconjugants (Figure 2).
Then, the plasmids were extracted from transconjugants and
sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq system. The analysis of the
sequences showed that the plasmids are extremely similar with
more than 99% identity, indicating that the plasmids from the
diﬀerent strains are indeed the same plamids. The NCBI BLAST
results showed that the hybrid plasmid carrying qnrS1 is a new
plasmid type (pSH-01, submission number KY486279.1). It was
43,257 bp in length and harbored 51 predicted open reading
frames. Furthermore, a plasmid sequence analysis (Carattoli et al.,
2014) of pSH-01 indicated that it is an IncR type hybrid plasmid.
According to the BLAST results of pSH-01 nucleotide
sequence against
the two junctions
(Figures 3B,C) were often occurred, indicating that the three
fragments are usually associated and transferred as a whole.
These fragments were almost derived from plasmids. Notably,
the genetic features of pSH-01 showed that the fragment carrying
qnrS1 (2849–14429) is derived from plasmids of one Shigella
ﬂexneri and six E. coli isolates (blast query cover: above 99%
and blast identity: 99%). Another fragment (nt14429–31031)
was derived from plasmids of Salmonella and other bacterial
isolates, and an additional fragment (30758–43257, 1–2851)
was mostly derived from plasmids of Klebsiella pneumoniae.
The origin of target plasmids covered diﬀerent bacterial host.
According to an alternative sequence analysis, for example,
it was postulated that pSH-01 might be hybrids of
three
plasmids (Figure 3A);
the region spanning nt 2849–14429
matched with plasmid pEBG1 (KF738053; nt 37915–26335) of
the E. coli strain, nt 14429–31031 shared a nucleotide identity
of 99% to the plasmid p33676 (CP012682; nt 25123–41725)
from S. Typhimurium, and nt 30758–43257, 1–2851 shared a

in another alternative sequence analysis. Therefore, based on
sequence analyses of three recombination junctions (Figure 3B),
it was postulated that Tn3, IS6 and homologous recombination
played important roles in the formation of pSH-01.

DISCUSSION

In the broiler supply chain in China, there are geographical
diﬀerences in the dominance of various Salmonella serotypes and
in the prevalence of ﬂuoroquinolones resistant Salmonella. In
this study, S. Indiana was the most common serotype isolated
from the broiler supply chain, which diﬀers from previous
results showing that S. Enteritidis is dominant in Qingdao and
S. Weltevreden is dominant in Guangdong, China (Cui et al.,
2016; Ren et al., 2016). In addition, several studies have indicated
Salmonella could be transmitted along the food chain (Nogrady
et al., 2008; Hauser et al., 2012). Our PFGE results showed that
there is the potential for the transmission of Salmonella along
the broiler chicken chain. With the emergence of antibiotic-
resistant bacteria presenting a serious challenge in human and

veterinary medicine globally, there is an abundance of evidence
showing that the antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella in the
chicken supply chain is more possibly attributed to the use
of antibiotics in the animal husbandry (Cui et al., 2016). In
particular, there are many reports of
increasing prevalence
of ﬂuoroquinolone-resistant Salmonella (Piddock, 2002; Wasyl
et al., 2014), which might be a potential risk for human health.
In this study, resistance to ciproﬂoxacin was detected in 37.0% of
the Salmonella isolates, and this resistance rate was relatively high
compared to those of previous reports (Cui et al., 2016; Ren et al.,
2016; Nhung et al., 2018).

hybridized plasmids.

In this study, the same PFGE pattern was shared among
the majority of Salmonella isolates (such as S. Indiana and
S. Schwarzengrund isolates), which might suggest they are clones
of S. Indiana and S. Schwarzengrund, respectively. Compared
with the QRDR genotypes in non-clones Salmonella isolates
(Eaves et al., 2004), the genetic diversity of Salmonella isolates in
this study was lower. In addition, similar to previous investigation
(Hopkins et al., 2005), our results indicate that missense
mutations occurred frequently in QRDR of gyrA and parC,
which are considered major quinolone resistance determinants in
Salmonella. In this study, gyrA missense mutations (Ser83Phe and
Asp87Asn) were detected in 26/73 Salmonella isolates and these
are considered the major target-site mutations in Salmonella
(Nüeschinderbinen et al., 2015). Thr57Ser parC substitution
was frequently observed in the Salmonella isolates, and a
second substitution (Ser80Arg) in parC was also detected in
26 Salmonella isolates. Importantly, Thr57Ser parC substitution
was considered not or doubtfully associated to ﬂuoroquinolone
resistance phenotypes (Wasyl et al., 2014). The 15 Salmonella
isolates with the Thr57Ser parC substitution in this study did
not show ﬂuoroquinolone resistance phenotypes, in agreement
with previous report (Ceyssens et al., 2015). Although mutation
types in gyrA and parC were similar to those in previous
studies of Salmonella, it is worth noting the high frequency of

silent site mutations in QRDR, which might be developed into
potential missense mutations (Heisig, 1993; Hopkins et al., 2005).
Furthermore, a recent study has shown that mutations in the
target genes gyrA and parC are correlated with an increase of
intrinsic ﬁtness in Salmonella (Baker et al., 2013). This indicated
that the potential risk that Salmonella isolates with mutations in
gyrA and parC may naturally maintain during the broiler chicken
supply chain, even if ﬂuoroquinolone use was reduced.

In addition, the predominant PMQR gene varies among
bacteria from diﬀerent sources. The most common PMQR
gene was oqxAB in E. coli from chicken (Chen et al., 2012)
and in Salmonella from retail meat (Lin et al., 2015), qnrB
in Enterobacteriaceae from crows (Halova et al., 2014), and
aac(6(cid:48))-Ib-cr in bacteria isolated from sewage and surface water
(Osinska et al., 2016). However, this study indicated that qnrS
was commonly distributed in Salmonella isolates from the
broiler chicken supply chain, consistent with the high reported
rates in Salmonella isolated from animals,
food, and feed
(Wasyl et al., 2014).

The recombination of plasmid, to some extent, can provide
a mechanism to improve the diversity of plasmids carrying
resistance genes. Recombination of hybrid plasmids frequently
occurs at insertion sequence (IS) location (Hudson et al., 2014).
Recently, NDM-5 and mcr-1 were recombined in the plasmid

pCQ02-121 by recombination junctions: IS26 and the nic site
of oriT (Sun et al., 2016). Similarly, in this study, the novel
plasmid pSH-01 might arise via recombination junction IS6. The
other two recombination junctions involve Tn3 and homologous
recombination of sequences. Transposons in the Tn3 family
can mediate gene reassortment and genomic plasticity owing to
their modular organization, and they contribution substantially
to antimicrobial drug resistance dissemination or to endowing
environmental catabolic capacities (Nicolas et al., 2015).

Genetic features of pSH-01 showed that only region 2
(nt 14429–31031) could matched the plasmid sequences from
clinical Salmonella isolates, and the sequences with matches
in the other two regions (region 1 and 3) were derived from
plasmids from non-Salmonella bacteria. The full-length of pSH-
01 did not match an individual plasmid in NCBI. Therefore,
this is a new plasmid in Salmonella isolates from the broiler
chicken supply chain, suggesting that the diversity of plasmids
carrying the resistance gene might be a potential risk factor for
the dissemination of qnrS1.

It is worth noting that the new plasmid carrying qnrS1
presented in the six Salmonella isolates (three S. Indiana and three
S. Schwarzengrund) from diﬀerent sources in the broiler chicken
supply chain. This suggests that there was a potential epidemic
spread of the plasmid in the Salmonella isolates of diﬀerent
serotype from diﬀerent geographical origin, which is similar
to the potential transmission of the plasmids among various
serotype of Salmonella and diverse geographical location (Li et al.,
2016; Wong et al., 2017). Therefore, we should carefully monitor
the new plasmid carrying qnrS1 along the chicken supply chain.
This study provided comprehensive data for the prevalence
of Salmonella and their ﬂuoroquinolone resistance determinants
associated with QRDR and PMQR in the broiler chicken supply

chain. Furthermore, we found that qnrS1, a transmissible PMQR
gene, was prevalent in Salmonella isolates from the broiler
chicken supply chain. Selective pressure from ﬂuoroquinolones
in animals may further promote the recombination and
dissemination of the plasmid carrying PMQR genes.
