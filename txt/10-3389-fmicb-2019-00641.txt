ABSTRACT 

 

Staphylococcus  aureus  is  one  of  the  most  important  food-borne  pathogens  globally.  It  produces 

various  toxins  and  invasive  enzymes  and  can  be  found  in  numerous  food  products.  Milk  is  an 

important  source  of  staphylococcal  food  poisoning.  After  pasteurization,  this  microorganism  or  its 

enterotoxins  might  still  remain  in  pasteurized  milk.  Therefore,  this  study  was  to  investigate  the 

contamination  of  S.  aureus  in  258  pasteurized  milk  from  39  cities  of  China.  The  prevalence  and 

levels  of  S.  aureus  in  these  samples  as  well  as  antibiotic  susceptibility  profiles,  virulence  genes, 
biofilm  formation  and  biofilm  related  genes,  spa  typing  and  MLST  were  used  to  determine  the 

characterization among the isolates. It was found 3.9% of samples were detected S. aureus in 8 of 39 

cities in China. The contaminated level were not  very excessive which showed the MPN values of 

the  most  positive  samples  (9/10)  were  less  than  1  MPN/g.  All  pasteurized  milk-related  S.  aureus 

isolates  have  ability  to  produce  biofilm  and  harbored  icaA,  icaD,  eno,  clfA,  clfB,  fnbA,  fnbB,  fib 

genes, other biofilm related genes icaC were showed in 91.7% of isolates and cna gene were showed 

in 50%, except bap gene which were free in all isolates. The antibiotic susceptibility test showed that 

all  isolates  were  resistant  or  intermediate-resistant  to  different  concentrations  of  the  antibiotics.

Furthermore, 75.0% of the isolates were resistant to three or more antibiotic classes, which indicated 

multidrug resistance. The isolates had virulence potential, which showed 66.7% (8/12) of the isolates 

carried one or more virulence-associated genes. Molecular typing by MLST and spa typing enabled 

classification of these isolates into a total of 11 sequence types (STs) and spa types, which indicated 

high genetic diversity. Most of these types were related to various clinical S. aureus infections. Thus, 

the  findings  of  this  study  reflect  the  potential  risk  of  S.  aureus  infection  in  China.  Our  study  also 

provides comprehensive analysis of the prevalence of S. aureus in pasteurized milk and helps ensure 

P r o v i

more accurate treatment of human infection with effective antibiotics.

Staphylococcus aureus is a pathogen associated with serious community and hospital-acquired 

diseases.  It  has  low  nutritional  requirements  and  widely  exists  in  nature.  In  China,  microbial 

food  poisoning  accounted  for  53.7%  of  food  poisoning  emergencies  in  2015.  Of  which,  S. 

aureus  was  an  important  pathogenic  factor  in  these  cases  (Wu  et  al.,  2018a).  In  the  United 

States, S. aureus causes approximately 241,000 cases of food poisoning each  year  (Scallan et 

al., 2011; Kadariya et al., 2014). This foodborne pathogen is considered as one of the world's 

leading  causes  of  disease  outbreaks  related  to  food  consumption,  being  responsible  for  a 

variety of manifestations and diseases (Jamali et al., 2015).   

 

S.  aureus  produces  a  variety  of  toxins  and  invasive  enzymes  such  as  staphylococcal 

enterotoxins  (SEs),  hemolysins,  Panton-Valentine  leukocidin  (PVL),  toxic  shock  syndrome 

toxin-1  (TSST-1),  plasma  coagulase,  and  deoxyribonuclease  (Spanu  et  al.,  2012). 

Differentiation  between  virulent  and  nonvirulent  strains  is  significant  for  evaluating  the 

potential implications of the presence of this microorganism for food safety and public health. 

In  which,  SEs  are  active  at  concentrations  ranging  from  high  nanogram  to  low  microgram 

quantities  (Larkin  et  al.,  2009)  and  are  resistant  to  conditions  (heat  treatment,  low  pH)  that

retaining their activity in the digestive tract after ingestion (Evenson et al., 1988; Argudín et al., 

2010). In addition, TSST-1 is a superantigenic exotoxin that causes toxic shock syndrome and 

PVL  is  a  bacteriophage-encoded  bicomponent  leukotoxin  that  is  in  some  strains  of  S.  aureus 

and  plays  a  key  role  in  leukocytolysis  and  tissue  necrosis  (Shallcross  et  al.,  2013).  S.  aureus 

often  develops  antibiotic  resistance.  Isolation  of  single-  or  multiple-drug  resistant  S.  aureus 

(MRSA) strains from food, the environment, and clinics has been constantly reported (Gould et 

al., 2012; Rasigade et al., 2014). The ability of S. aureus to form biofilms helps the bacterium 

to  survive  in  hostile  environments  within  the  host  and  is  considered  to  be  responsible  for 

chronic  or  persistent  infections  (Costerton  et  al.,  1999).  The  ability  of  some  strains  to 

synthesize  biofilms  could  increase  their  pathogenicity  since  established  biofilms  can  tolerate 

antimicrobial agents, thus making the bacterium extremely difficult to eradicate (Zmantar et al., 

2010).   

 

Nowadays,  molecular  typing  methods  are  crucial  in  epidemiological  investigations  of  food 

processing and enhance the resolution of surveillance (Shi et al., 2015). Of various subtyping 

approaches,  multilocus  sequence  typing  (MLST)  is  a  widely  accepted  method  of  DNA

sequence  based  typing  that  based  on  analysis  of  relatively  conserved  genes  that  encode 

essential proteins. For S. aureus, the level of discrimination provided by MLST is sufficient to 

provide a relatively detailed picture of the global dissemination of the organism (Saunders and 

Holmes,  2007).  spa  typing  is  another  efficient  typing  method  for  S.  aureus,  it  based  on 

sequencing  of  the  polymorphic  X  region  of  the  protein  A  gene  (spa)  (Hallin  et  al.,  2009). 

Similar  to  MLST,  it  suggests  that  spa  typing  is  suitable  for  epidemiology  and  evolutionary 

investigations based on studies of European and international isolates (Wu et al., 2018b).   

 

Milk  is  an  important  source  of  staphylococcal  food  poisoning.  There  are  several  foodborne 

outbreaks of S. aureus intoxications have been documented to be associated with consumption 

of  contaminated  milk  (De  Buyser  et  al.,  1985;  Miwa  etal.,  2001;  Fetsch  et  al.,  2014).  In 

addition, raw milk and raw milk products are frequently contaminated with different types of S. 

aureus around the world (Tham et al., 1990; Yu et al., 2010; Rosengren et al., 2010; Jamali et 

al.,  2015;  Riva  et  al.,  2015).  Milk  is  a  good  substrate  for  S.  aureus  growth  and  enterotoxin 

production.  Enterotoxins  can  retain  their  biological  activity  after  pasteurization  (Asao  et  al., 

2003; Rall et al., 2008). In China, studies have reported that some S. aureus strains persist in 

powdered  infant  formula  (Wang  et  al.,  2012).  Currently,  only  a  few  full-scale  and  systematic 

studies have been performed on S. aureus prevalence and contamination levels in pasteurized 

milk  in  China.  This  study  aimed  to  investigate  S.  aureus  contamination  in  pasteurized  milk

2. Materials and Methods 

108 

2.1 Sampling 

109 

From  July  2011-June  2016,  a  total  of  258  pasteurized  milk  samples  were  collected  from 

110 

supermarkets, fairs, and farmers’ markets (Supplementary Table 1). The samples were obtained 

111 

from  39  cities  located  in  a  total  of  29  provinces  and  2  directly  controlled  municipalities  in 

112 

China, which covered most of the provincial capitals of China (Supplementary Figure 1). The 

113 

samples  were  placed  in  a  cold  box  at  approximately  4  °C,  tightly  sealed  with  sterile  plastic 

114 

wrap, transported to an accredited laboratory, and subjected to microbiological analysis within 

115 

24 h.

116 

2.2 Isolation and detection   

 

117 

The samples were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed to detect S. aureus. For qualitative 

118 

analysis,  samples  were  examined  according  to  GB  4789.30-2010  (National  Food  Safety 

119 

Standards of China) with slight modification. The most probable number (MPN) method was 

120 

used  for  quantitative  analysis.  Approximately  25  g  of  the  food  sample  was  homogenized  in 

121 

225 mL  tryptic  soy  broth  with  10%  sodium  chloride  (Huankai,  Guangzhou,  China). 

122 

Subsequently, 1-mL, 0.1-mL, and 0.01-mL aliquots were transferred to tubes containing 9 mL, 

123 

10  mL,  and  10  mL  in  triplicate  with  trypticase  soy  broth  (Huankai)  supplemented  with  10% 

124 

NaCl. The tubes were then incubated at 37 °C for 48 h.   

125 

 

126 

A loopful of enrichment  broth culture (10 µL) was streaked onto chromogenic  S. aureus agar 

127 

plates (Huankai) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Of the colonies obtained, 1–4 pink colonies 

128 

were purified on nutrient agar medium. The purified colonies were analyzed via the coagulase 

activity  test  involving  freeze-dried  rabbit  plasma  (Huankai),  and  the  API  STAPH  test  strips 

(bioMerieux, Marcy-l’Etoile, France) were then used. The MPN value was determined on the 

basis of the number of positive tube(s) in each of the three sets using the MPN table.

2.3 Antimicrobial susceptibility testing   

P r o v i

s

The Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion method was used to test antibiotic susceptibility, and diameter 

interpretations  were  based  on  the  protocol  specified  in  the  guidelines  of  the  Clinical  and 

Laboratory  Standards  Institute  (CLSI,  2015).  S.  aureus  ATCC  25923  and  Escherichia  coli 

ATCC  25922  were  used  as  quality  control  organisms.  All  isolates  were  assessed  for 

antimicrobial  susceptibility  to  24  antibiotics  (Oxoid,  UK):  amoxycillin/clavulanic  acid, 

138 

ampicillin,  cefepime,  cefoxitin,  penicillin  G,  ceftazidime,  amikacin,  gentamicin,  kanamycin, 

139 

streptomycin,  chloramphenicol,  clindamycin,  erythromycin,  telithromycin,  ciprofloxacin, 

140 

norfloxacin, 

tetracycline, 

linezolid, 

trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 

(1:19), 

rifampicin, 

141 

quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, nitrofurantoin, and fusidic acid. The CLSI zone diameter 

142 

breakpoints were used to interpret the antimicrobial susceptibilities of the analyzed strains. 

143 

2.4 In vivo biofilm formation 

144 

Biofilm production was  quantified using a microtiter plate assay (MPA)  described  previously 

145 

(Vasudevan et al., 2003), with slight modifications. S. aureus strains were individually grown 

146 

at 37 °C overnight in brain heart infusion broth (BHI). The overnight culture was diluted 1:100 

147 

in  fresh  BHI,  and  200-µL  aliquots  of  each  prepared  suspension  were  transferred  into  three 

 

5 

148 

wells  of  96-well  tissue  culture  treated  polystyrene  microplates  (CELLSTAR®  Cell  Culture 

149 

Microplates,  Greiner  Bio-one,  Frickenhausen,  Germany).  After  cultivation  at  37  °C  for  48  h, 

 

150 

the wells were washed three times with 200 mL sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) 

151 

and dried at room temperature. The adherent bacterial cells were fixed with 200 µL methanol 

152 

for 15 min, and the plates were emptied and left to dry overnight. The adherent cells were then 

153 

stained with 1% crystal violet for 10 min and washed twice with water. The dye bound to the 

154 

adherent cells was dissolved with 150 mL 95% ethanol and optical density (OD) was measured 

155 

at  590  nm  with  a  spectrophotometer  (SpectroStar  Nano,  BMG  Labtech).  Uninoculated  wells 

156 

containing BHI served as blanks. Blank-corrected absorbance values of S. aureus strains were 

157 

used  for  reporting  biofilm  production.  Isolates  were  considered  biofilm  producers  when  their 

158 

OD values were three times greater than the standard deviation of the mean Dc. Additionally, 

159 

isolates  showing  biofilm-producing  ability  were  classified  as  weak  (Dc  <  OD  ≤  2*Dc), 

160 

moderate (2*Dc < OD ≤ 4*Dc), or strong (OD > 4*Dc) biofilm producers.   

161 

2.5 DNA extraction and PCR   

i o n a

l

s

After the isolates were cultivated for at 37 °C 24 h in BHI, genomic DNA was extracted using 

a  Genomic  DNA  Extraction  kit  (Magen  Biotech,  Guangzhou,  China)  according  to  the 

manufacturer’s  instructions.  The  genomic  DNA  concentration  was  determined  at  260  nm  by 

using a NanoDrop-ND-1000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). 

P r o v i

The mecA/mecC gene, which confers methicillin resistance to S. aureus, was detected by PCR 

performed  using  primers  described  previously  (Perez-Roth  et  al.,  2001;  Stegger  et  al.,  2012). 

PCR  was  also  used  to  detect  the  presence  of  virulence  genes.  The  detection  of  18  SE  genes 

(sea, seb, sec, sed, see, seg, seh, sei, sej, sek, sel, sem, sen, seo, sep, seq, ser, and seu), the tsst 

gene and the presence of lukSF-PV (pvl) genes was performed as previously described (Jarraud

et al., 2002; Varshney et al., 2009). For adhesion genes (clfA, clfB, fnbA, fnbB, fib, and cna) and 

172 

biofilm-producing  genes  (icaA,  icaD,  icaC,  bap,  and  eno),  PCR  was  performed  according  to 

173 

previous studies (Zmantar et al., 2010; Artini et al., 2013; Salaberry et al., 2015; Pereyra et al., 

174 

2016).  The  primer  sequences  used  in  the  PCR  assays,  expected  amplified  product  sizes,  and 

175 

references  are  listed  in  Supplementary  Table  2.  The  amplicons  were  stained  with  Goldview, 

176 

loaded  onto  1.5%  agarose  gels,  electrophoresed  at  120  V  for  0.5  h,  and  visualized  by  a  UV 

177 

transilluminator  gel  imaging  system  (GE  Healthcare,  WI,  USA).  The  images  were  saved  as 

178 

TIFF files for analysis.   

 

6 

179 

2.6 Molecular typing   

 

180 

All the isolates were characterized by MLST and spa typing. The MLST analysis was based on 

181 

DNA sequencing of the seven housekeeping genes arcC, aroE, glpF, gmk, pta, tpi, and yqil, as 

182 

described  previously  (Enright  et  al.,  2013).  The  primers  spa-1113f  (5′-TAA  AGA  CGA  TCC 

183 

TTC GGT GAG C-3′) and spa-1514r (5′-CAG CAG TAG TGC CGT TTG CTT-3′) were used 

184 

for  spa  amplification  (Shopsin  et  al.,  1999).  The  PCR  products  were  purified  with  a  PCR 

185 

purification  kit  (Qiagen,  Genmany)  and  were  sequenced  in  both  directions  with  Big  Dye 

186 

fluorescent terminators on an ABI 3730XL sequencer (Applied BioSystems). For each MLST 

187 

locus, an allele number was assigned to each distinct sequence variant, and a distinct sequence 

188 

type  (ST)  number  was  attributed  to  each  distinct  combination  of  alleles  for  the  seven  genes. 

189 

STs were determined using the S. aureus MLST database (https://pubmlst.org/saureus/). Clonal 

190 

complex (CC) analysis was performed using eBURST v.3 as previously described (Feil et al., 

191 

2004).  The 

spa 

types  were 

randomly  assigned  using 

the  SpaServer  website 

(https://spaserver2.ridom.de).  Sequence  Type  Analysis  and  Recombinational  Tests  software 

(S.T.A.R.T. ver. 2; https://pubmlst.org/software/analysis/start2) was used to analyze the MLST

3.1 Isolation and identification of S. aureus from pasteurized milk   

Of  the  258  pasteurized  milk  samples,  10  samples  were  contaminated  with  coagulase-positive 

staphylococci,  and  12  isolates  obtained  from  these  positive  samples  were  confirmed  as  S. 

aureus  by  the  API  STAPH  test.  The  qualitative  and  quantitative  results  for  these  positive 

200 

samples  are  shown  in  Table  1.  Overall,  the  mean  prevalence  of  S.  aureus  was  3.9%,  and  the 

201 

MPN  values  for  the  samples  showing  the  highest  levels  (9/10)  were  less  than  1  MPN/g. 

202 

Positive  samples  were  obtained  from  8  of  the  39  Chinese  cities  included  (Supplementary 

203 

Figure  1):  33.3%  of  the  positive  samples  were  from  Zhanjiang  and  Xining  cities,  and  16.7% 

204 

were  obtained  from  the  other  six  cities,  respectively.  Besides,  among  the  different  types  of 

205 

sampling  source,  the  positive  samples  isolated  from  fairs  was  4.2%  (6/144)  followed  by 

206 

farmer`s market (3.8%, 1/26) and supermarkets (3.4%, 3/88).   

207 

3.2 Antibiotic resistance

quinupristin/dalfopristin,  8.3%.  All  the  isolates  were  susceptible  to  cefepime,  cefoxitin, 

217 

linezolid,  and  nitrofurantoin.  The  mecA/mecC  gene  was  free  in  all  S.  aureus  isolates. 

218 

Combining  with  antibiotic  resistance  test,  there  was  none  of  MRSA  isolates  identified. 

219 

However, only one isolate was susceptible to all the antimicrobial agents tested, whereas two 

220 

isolates were resistant to two antibiotics and 75.0% of isolates (9/12) were resistant to three or 

221 

more  classes  of  antibiotics  which  showed  multi-drug  resistance  including  one  strain  Sta1758 

222 

were resistant to more than 10 antibiotics. 

3.3 In vitro biofilm production and presence of biofilm-related genes 

The MPA results showed that all  the S. aureus strains  could produce biofilms, including four

s

isolates  (33.3%,  4/12)  showing  moderate  and  eight  isolates  (76.7%,  8/12)  showing  strong 

biofilm  formation  (Table  3).  Table  3  also  provides  the  results  for  the  presence  of  S.  aureus 

adhesion and biofilm-associated genes. Overall, icaA, icaD, eno, clfA, clfB, fnbA, fnbB, and fib 

were found in all 12 isolates, whereas the bap gene was free in all isolates. In addition, icaC 

was present in 91.7% (11/12) of the isolates and the cna gene in 50% (6/12). Thus, most of the 

biofilm-producing  genes  and  adhesion  genes  were  present  in  these  S.  aureus  strains  isolated 

P r o v i

from the pasteurized milk samples. 

232 

3.4 Prevalence of virulence-associated genes 

233 

The  prevalence  of  virulence-associated  genes  is  shown  in  Figure  1.  Of  the  S.  aureus  isolates 

234 

analyzed,  66.7%  (8/12)  carried  one  or  more  virulence-associated  genes.  Of  the  20  virulence 

235 

genes  investigated,  seg,  sei,  and  sem  were  most  frequently  detected  which  showed  41.7%  of 

236 

prevalence, respectively. sea, seb, sed, see, seu, seq, sej, ser, sek, and pvl were not detected in 

237 

the S. aureus isolates. The prevalence of the other virulence genes is as follows: sen (25%), sec 

238 

(16.7%),  sel  (16.7%),  seo  (8.3%),  sep  (8.3%),  seh  (8.3%)  and  tsst  (8.3%).  Staphylococcal 

239 

enterotoxin genes can be divided into classic SE genes (sea, seb, sec, sed, and see), egc cluster 

240 

genes (seg, sei, sem, sen, seo, and seu), and other novel SE genes (sep, seq, she, sej, sel, ser, 

241 

and sek). From the classic SE genes, only two isolates showed the sec gene, that is 7.7% (2/26) 

 

8 

242 

prevalence in the detected genes. The egc cluster accounted for 73.1% (19/26) of the detected 

 

243 

genes, and other novel SE genes accounted for 15.4%.   

244 

3.5 Molecular characterization of S. aureus isolates 

245 

MLST analysis of the 12 isolates yielded 11 STs showing high genetic diversity. Except ST188 

246 

was found in two strains, the other STs were present in single strains which included ST1, ST5, 

247 

ST7,  ST9,  ST12,  ST15,  ST25,  ST72,  ST398,  and  ST4069.  Of  these,  ST4069  was  a  newly 

248 

assigned  ST,  which  found  a  single-locus  variant  (SLV)  on  the  aroE  gene  (assigned  as 

249 

aroE-472).  spa  typing  showed  results  similar  to  those  of  MLST.  Eleven  spa  types  were 

250 

detected:  t189  was  found  in  two  strains,  and  t177,  t899,  t213,  t3092,  t148,  t091,  t002,  t085, 

251 

t078,  and  t034  were  found  in  single  isolates.  The  phylogenetic  tree  based  on  the  seven 

252 

concatenated  MLST  sequences  in  Figure  2  shows  the  relatedness  between  these  isolates. 

253 

ST188 correlated well with t189, which was also found in city of Xining.

4 Discussion 

i o n a

l

s

Pasteurization, or heat treatment, of milk is an important milestone in for public health and has 

contributed to  a dramatic decline in  many infectious  diseases. However,  outbreaks associated 

with pasteurized milk continue to occur (Ryan et al., 1987; Dalton et al.,  1997; Ackers et al., 

2000). In China, milk has become an important component of a balanced diet, and the annual 

per capita milk consumption increased from 9.23 kg in 1992 to 24.87 kg in 2007 (Qian et al., 

2011;  Liu  and  Wang,  2013).  SFP  outbreaks  associated  with  milk  have  occurred occasionally 

(Dai  et  al.,  2009).  There  were  limited  researches  on  the  prevalence  of  S.  aureus  from 

P r o v i

264 

pasteurized milk in China. In the current study, 3.9% of the samples showed the presence of S. 

aureus.  Compare  with  other  countries’  studies,  the  prevalence  of  S.  aureus  from  pasteurized 
milk in our study is lower. In Brazil, Rall et al. (2008) collected 162 raw and pasteurized milk 

265 

samples and found 20.4% of the pasteurized milk samples were positive for S. aureus. In 2006, 

266 

Gündoğan et al. (2006) analyzed 180 raw milk, pasteurized milk, and ice cream samples; 56.6% 

267 

of the pasteurized milk samples were positive for S. aureus. However, it is maybe attribute to 

268 

the sample sizes, sample source or geographic locations, which showed most of these S. aureus 

269 

were  isolated  from  farm,  whereas  our  samples  were  collected  from  supermarkets,  fairs  or 

270 

farmer`s  markets.  Quantitative  analysis  by  MPN  showed  that  only  one  S.  aureus–positive 

271 

sample reached a level of 10 MPN/g. In China, a limit of 100 CFU/g (mL) has been proposed 

272 

for S. aureus in  milk and the highest  fraction of  samples with  values that exceeded this limit 

273 

was observed at the end of food shelf-life (Helwigh and Korsgaard, 2007). Thus, the currently 

 

9 

274 

available  data,  along  with  our  study,  indicate  that  levels  of  S.  aureus  in  pasteurized  milk  in 

 

275 

China are not very high.   

276 

 

277 

Staphylococcal enterotoxins are responsible for most SFP outbreaks (Dinges et al., 2000, Loir   

278 

et  al.,  2003).  This  could  account  for  retention  of  biological  activity  after  pasteurization.  This 

279 

study was investigated the 18 SE genes among pasteurized milk related S. aureus isolates and 

280 

found that 66.7% of the isolates carried one or more SE genes, suggesting the risk of S. aureus 

281 

contamination in pasteurized milk in China. This rate is higher than that reported in a previous 

282 

study  (Chao  et  al.,  2015)  in  which  the  prevalence  of  18  SE  genes  was  studied  in  S.  aureus 

283 

isolates obtained from different origins in China, showing that 54.4% of those isolates harbored 

284 

SE genes. Generally, the sea gene has been the most common gene in the SFP outbreak isolates 

285 

tested, followed by the sed gene from classic SE genes (Kérouanton et al., 2007), but they were 

286 

not  detected  in  the  current  study.  sec  was  the  only  classical  SE  gene  detected  in  our  study, 

287 

which is the most commonly occurring SE in milk (Lindqvist et al., 2002; Scherrer et al., 2004; 

288

s

Aragon-Alegro  et  al.,  2007).  In  2002,  an  outbreak  of  community-acquired  foodborne  illness 

caused  by  MRSA  was  attributed  to  SEC-containing  coleslaw,  which  was  produced  in  the 

United  States  (Jones  et  al.,  2002).  In  addition,  we  observed  higher  prevalence  of  seg-sei-sem 

among  the  isolates  in  our  study,  these  SE  genes  belonged  to  the  egc  cluster,  which  is  widely 

distributed in clinical isolates and acts as a putative nursery of enterotoxin genes (Jarraud et al., 

i o n a

l

2001; Wu et al., 2018b). Thus, the hazard posed by these isolates harboring SE genes should 

P r o v i

not be ignored.   

295 

 

In the current study, all S. aureus strains obtained from pasteurized milk samples could produce 

biofilms  and  showed  moderate  or  strong  biofilm  production  capability.  In  addition,  various 

298 

genes have been reported to be involve in biofilm formation, of these genes the ica group genes 

299 

especially icaA and icaD ( Arciola et al., 2001) and the other group such as fnbA, fnbB, cna and 

300 

eno  genes  that  encode  MSCRAMMs  proteins  (Atshan  et  al.,  2012)  are  noticeable.  Most  of 

301 

these  genes  were  present  in  the  S.  aureus  strains  isolated  from  our  samples.  This  result  were 

302 

similar  with  the  research  by  Atshan  et  al.  (2012)  who  detected  9  MSCRAMM  and  4  biofilm 

303 

related  genes  in  the  MSSA  and  MRSA  isolates  from  clinically  patients  by  PCR  method  and 

304 

found fnbA, eno, ebpS, clfA, clfB, icaA, icaD, icaB, and icaC genes were detected in 100% of 

305 

isolates.  Furthermore,  fib  and  cna  were  detected  in  90%  and  46.6%  MSSA  isolates, 

306 

respectively, which is in agreement with our result. In our study, the bap gene was free in all S. 

307 

aureus  isolates.  Many  studies  have  reported  that  the  bap  gene  was  not  detected  or  very  low 

308 

rates in the solutes studied (Melchior et al., 2007; Szweda et al., 2012; Khoramrooz et al., 2016; 

 

10 

 

309 

Pereyra  et  al.,  2016;  Felipe  et  al.,  2017).  Although  there  was  inconclusive  evidence  for  the 

310 

correlation  between  phenotypic  tests  and  the  detection  of  specific  genes  associated  with 

311 

adhesion and biofilm formation, the presence of icaA, icaD, icaC, fnbA, clfA, clfB, fnbA, fnb, 

312 

and  fib  genes  indicated  a  significant  association  with  biofilm  formation  in  this  study.  The 

313 

biofilm  production  in  isolates  with  negative  results  for  any  of  the  genes  studied  may  be 

314 

attributable to other biofilm-related genes.   

315 

 

316 

Antimicrobial resistance was noted in pasteurized milk related S. aureus isolates. Most of the 

317 

isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent. However, resistance to ampicillin and 

318 

penicillin was higher than that reported in many previous studies involving S. aureus isolates 

319 

from  dairy  samples  (Rosengren  et  al.,  2010;  Jamali  et  al.,  2015;  Riva  et  al.,  2015).  We  also 

320 

observed  that  25.0%  of  the  isolates  were  resistant  to  multiple  antibiotics  such  as  ampicillin, 

321 

gentamicin,  kanamycin,  clindamycin,  erythromycin,  and  telithromycin.  These  were  similar  to 

322 

the  study  by  Jamali  et  al.’  investigationt,  which  showed  the  resistance  profiles  of  S.  aureus 

isolates  from  raw  milk  and  dairy  products  for  tetracycline,  penicillin,  clindamycin, 

erythromycin, streptomycin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and gentamicin (Jamali et al., 2015). 

Furthermore, many isolates were found intermediate-resistant to the selected antibiotics in this 

study. The reduced antibiotic susceptibility of these antibiotics suggests that these bacteria may 

be  exposed  to  such  antimicrobials  for  a  long  time  (Howden  BP  et  al.,  2010).  Thus,  it  should 

draw  public  attention  and  controlled  use  of  antimicrobials  would  limit  the  emergence  of

P r o v i

MLST  and  spa  genotyping  have  shown  a  highly  clonal  population  structure  for  S.  aureus  in 

many  studies  (Kanika  et  al.,  2011;  Fetsch  et  al.,  2014;  Basanisi  et  al.,  2017).  The  S.  aureus 

333 

MLST  database 

(https://pubmlst.org/bigsdb?db=pubmlst_saureus_isolates&page=profiles) 

334 

currently  has  5024  different  STs.  However,  some  STs  are  specific  to  a  particular  source.  For 

335 

example,  ST398  occurs  in  livestock-associated  S.  aureus;  ST5,  ST45,  and  ST239  have  been 

336 

detected in hospital-associated S. aureus infections; and ST1, ST8, ST30, and ST59 are often 

337 

related  to  community-associated  S.  aureus  infections  (Bens  et  al.,  2006;  Cui  and  Li,  2009; 

338 

Neela  et  al.,  2009;  Skov,  2009;  Deleo  et  al.,  2010).  Generally,  spa  typing  showed  highly 

339 

concordant  with  MLST.  In  the  current  study,  MLST  and  spa  typing  enabled  classification  of 

340 

pasteurized  milk  related  S.  aureus  isolates  into  11  types  (ST188-t189,  ST1-t177,  ST9-899, 

341 

ST12-t213,  ST72-t3092,  ST7-t091,  ST5-t002,  ST15-t085,  ST25-t078,  ST398-t034,  and 

342 

ST4069-t148). Most of these STs were detected in various of samples and relevant to a variety 

343 

of  clinical  S.  aureus  infections  (Krziwanek  et  al.,  2009;  Lee  et  al.,  2011;  Yu  et  al.,  2012; 

 

11 

344 

Schaumburg  et  al.,  2015).  Therefore,  the  hazards  of  these  strains  for  consumers  cannot  be 

 

345 

ignored. 

346 

 

347 

To  conclude,  our  results  provide  information  regarding  the  genetic  background  of  S.  aureus 

348 

strains  obtained  from  pasteurized milk  samples  in China. To our knowledge, our study  is  the 

349 

first  systematic  investigation  of  prevalence  and  contamination  levels  for  S.  aureus  isolated 

350 

from pasteurized milk samples in China. Different source strains showed different types in this 

351 

study. These isolates had virulence potential, which half of them carried enterotoxin genes and 

352 

infection-related molecular type. The resistance patterns can help determine more appropriate 

353 

treatments  for  human  infections  in  China.  All  the  isolates  had  moderate  or  strong 

354 

biofilm-production capability, and most of them harbored biofilm-related genes, indicating that 

355 

these potentially virulent bacteria could persist in the food-manufacturing environment.
