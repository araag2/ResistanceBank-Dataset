Detection of Enterotoxin Genes and
Methicillin-Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus
Isolated from Water Buffalo Milk and Dairy
Products

Erdem Saka and Goknur Terzi Gulel

Abstract: The aim of this study was to analyze the presence of genes encoding staphylococcal enterotoxins and methicillin
resistance in Staphylococcus aureus isolates obtained from water buffalo milk and dairy products. A total of 200 samples
(100 raw milk, 50 clotted cream, and 50 cheese samples) was collected from different dairy farms and smallholders in
Samsun, Turkey. All samples were analyzed using the standard procedure EN ISO 6888-1 and isolates were conﬁrmed for
the presence of the target 16S rRNA speciﬁc for Staphylococcus genus speciﬁc and nuc gene speciﬁc for S. aureus species
by PCR. S. aureus was identiﬁed in 30 of 100 milk (30%), 9 of 50 clotted cream (18%), and 17 of 50 cheese (34%)
samples. A total of 99 isolates was conﬁrmed as S. aureus. Genotypic methicillin resistance was evaluated using PCR for
the mecA gene. Out of 99 isolates, nine (9%) were found to be methicillin resistant (mecA gene positive). Twelve out of
99 (12%) S. aureus isolates were found positive for one or more genes encoding the enterotoxins. The gene coding for
enterotoxin, sea, was the most frequent (ﬁve isolates, 41.6%), followed by sec (two isolates, 16.6%), sed (1 isolates, 8.3%)
and see (1 isolate, 8.3%). While three isolates (25%) contained both sec and sed, none of the samples was positive for seb.
In conclusion, the presence of se gene-positive and methicillin-resistant S. aureus in buffalo milk and products revealed
that consumption of these products is a potential risk of foodborne infection in this region.

Enterotoxigenic and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in milk and dairy products is an im-
Practical Application:

Introduction

Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive, facultative anaerobic
coccal bacterium that is frequently located on the skin, and in
the nose and respiratory tract of human and animals (Bergdoll,
1989; Otto, 2010). Staphylococcal food poisoning occurs as a re-
sult of consuming foods containing sufﬁcient amounts of entero-
toxins (Argudin, Mendoza, & Rodicio, 2010). S. aureus can lead
to a wide variety of diseases ranging from minor skin infections,
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea to life-threatening diseases such as
pneumonia and septicemia (Liu et al., 2011). Several foodborne
outbreaks of S. aureus intoxications have been reported to be as-
sociated with the consumption of contaminated milk and dairy
products in many countries (Asoa et al., 2003; Ostyn et al., 2010).
S. aureus is a ubiquitous organism that can be found in the
air, water, milk, sewage, and milking equipment (Bergdoll, 1989).
The main sources of contamination of raw milk are dairy an-
imals with mastitis, animal skin, and mammary glands (Vautor,
Abadie, Guibert, Huard, & Pepin, 2003). Milking equipment,

cheese-making machinery, and improper food handling are con-
sidered other causes of contamination (Fagundes, Barchesi, Filh,
Ferreira, & Oliveira, 2010; Jorgensen, Mork, & Rorvik, 2005).
S. aureus has been isolated in raw milk, cheese, ice cream, clot-
ted cream, and butter all over the world (Fagundes et al., 2010;
Gucukoglu, Cadirci, Terzi, Kevenk, & Alisarli, 2013; Jakobsen,
Heggebo, Sunde, & Skjervheim, 2011; Jorgensen et al., 2005;
Rahimi & Alian, 2013). S. aureus is often isolated from raw milk
products because the milk is heated only slightly without proper
pasteurization during traditional homemade cheese production.
The presence of S. aureus has been reported in dairy products,
especially at the stage from milk to curd (Arques et al., 2005;
Jakobsen et al., 2011).

Buffalo milk is an important source of protein. It is accepted
to be superior in comparison to cow milk because it contains less
water, a higher total solids content, higher fat content, and higher
calorie content (Soysal, 2006). The Turkish Statistical Institute
(TUIK) (2016) has reported that the total number of buffaloes
in Turkey reached about 142,000 in 2016, of which 63,300 were
dairy buffaloes. In addition, it was reported that the average buffalo
milk production reached 63,000 tons during the same period.
Buffalo milk is generally consumed as yoghurt, clotted cream,
butter, and cheese in Turkey. S. aureus has been reported in buffalo
milk by several researchers (D’Apice, Fenizia, Capparelli, Scala, &
Iannelli, 1996; Rahimi & Alian, 2013).

S. aureus produces several virulence factors including entero-
toxins (SEs), exfoliative toxin (ET), toxic shock syndrome toxin
(TSST-1), thermonuclease, hemolysins, hyaluronidase, lipases, and
coagulase (Iandolo, 1989; Sandel, & McKillip, 2004). The staphy-
lococcal enterotoxins (SEs) have been classiﬁed into ﬁve class-
ical serological types (SEA, SEB, SEC, SED, and SEE). These
classical SEs have been reported to be responsible for 95% of
staphylococcal food poisoning outbreaks (Bergdoll, 1983). In the
last 2 decades, new types of SEs and SE-like (SEl) toxins (SEG to
SEI, SElJ, SEK to SET, SElU, SElV, SElX, and SElY) have been
reported (Bania et al., 2006; Chian, Chang, Lin, Yang, & Tsen,
2006; Ono et al., 2017; Wilson et al., 2011). Among the en-
terotoxins, SEA is the most common enterotoxin-related cause of
staphylococcal food poisoning worldwide, followed by SED and
SEB (Argudin et al., 2010).

Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has been a primary epi-
demiological and clinical problem globally in the last 10 years
(Mimica et al., 2007). The mecA gene encodes for penicillin bind-
ing protein 2a (PBP2a), which determines resistance to methicillin
(Beck, Berger-Bachi, & Kayser, 1986). The mecA gene is highly
conserved in staphylococcal strains. Detection of mecA is consid-
ered to be the gold standard in determining resistance to β-lactam
antibiotics in general. The mecA gene is responsible for the re-
sistance to methicillin and is used as an indicator for resistance
to the other β-lactams (Maes, Magdalena, Rottiers, Gheldre, &
Struelens, 2002).

MRSA has become endemic worldwide in hospitals and has
also spread into local communities (Goetghebeur, Landry, Han,
& Vicente, 2007). MRSA, including strains of animal origin,
has been frequently observed in dairy products such as raw
milk or traditional cheeses (Peton & Le Loir, 2014; Wendlandt,
Schwarz, & Silley, 2013). Studies to date have revealed that
MRSA, either livestock-associated (LA-MRSA), community-
associated (CA-MRSA), or hospital-associated (HA-MRSA), can
be present in/on food that is intended for human consumption
(Peton & Le Loir, 2014; Rhee & Woo, 2010; Wendlandt et al.,
2013).

Methicillin resistance in S. aureus can be also sourced from the
newly described mecA homologue mecC gene and other factors
ensuring resistance. Several studies revealed the presence of mecA
negative, but phenotype-positive MRSA strains in milk and food
samples. Li, Zhou, Wang, Xue, and Zhao (2015) reported that
seven S. aureus isolates derived from milk samples displayed a MIC
value higher than >4 μg/mL to oxacillin though they did not
carry mecA or mecC genes.

The objectives of this study were (1) to investigate the presence
of S. aureus in buffalo milk and dairy products in Samsun, Turkey,
(2) to conﬁrm the presence of 16S rRNA and nuc genes using
PCR, (3) to evaluate the classical enterotoxin genes (sea, seb, sec,
sed, and see) of S. aureus isolates, and (4) to assess the methicillin
resistance of these isolates based on the presence of the mecA gene.

Materials and Methods
Sample collection

In this study, 100 samples of buffalo milk and 100 dairy products
(50 buffalo clotted cream and 50 buffalo cheese samples) obtained
from 30 randomly selected farms and smallholders in four different
districts in Samsun were used as material. Totally, 200 samples
were analyzed from November 2012 to May 2013 by examining
30 to 35 samples each month. All samples were transported to the
laboratory in containers with ice bags within 1 to 2 hr.

The selected farms in our study were classiﬁed as small (ﬁve to
10 heads animals), medium (10 to 50 heads animals), and large
(50 or more animals) scales according to the buffalo numbers they
contained. All samples were obtained from farms that use hand-
milking technique and make traditional production. The daily
average production of buffalo milk in the farms that the samples
were collected was about 3 to 5 kg per animal.

Traditional buffalo cheese is produced from raw milk. The milk
is ﬁltered and drained. The raw milk (10 kg) is heated to 38 °C to
40 °C, to which 1 to 3 mL of cheese yeast is added and mixed. It
is left for fermentation for 2 hr. The curd is cut into small pieces
and ﬁltered. Coagulants formed after fermentation are placed in

special sealed bags. Three kilograms of cheese are produced from
10 kg buffalo milk.

In the production of traditional buffalo clotted cream, the milk
is ﬁltered ﬁrst and boiled at 90 °C to 95 °C for 3 to 4 h in such a
way that it does not stick to bottoms and edges by mixing. After
this process, the milk is poured to pans that have a depth of 10 cm
in such a way that provides foamy and porous cream formation
from a certain height. The pans are cooled to 40 °C and again
heated to 70 °C with a brief heating. Afterwards, they are kept
in cool conditions for 24 hr. Small pieces of ices are sprinkled to
harden the cream layer.

Detection of coagulase-positive staphylococci and
S. aureus

All samples were analyzed for the presence of coagulase-positive
staphylococci (CPS) and S. aureus according to EN ISO 6888-1
(ISO, 1999). The samples were cultured on Baird-Parker (BP)
agar and incubated at 37 °C for 24 and 48 hr. At the end of
fermentation, 3 to 5 typical and atypical suspected colonies were
collected from each BP agar. All of the isolates were analyzed by
PCR for 16S rRNA, nuc and mecA genes.

rRNA primers, 0.4 μM nuc primers, 0.4 μM mecA primers, 2 U
Taq-Polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich), and 5 μL of target DNA. PCR
ampliﬁcation conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at
94 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 2 min, an-
nealing at 52 °C for 2 min, extension at 72 °C for 2 min, and
ﬁnal extension at 72 °C for 7 min in a thermal cycler (Bio-Rad
MJ Mini-PTC-1148). DNA fragments were separated on 1.5%
agarose in Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer (89 mM Tris, 89 mM
boric acid, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.3) and stained with ethidium bro-
mide at 0.5 μg/mL. Electrophoresis was carried out at 90 V for
1 hr (BioRad Power Pac-Basic, Singapore; BioRad electrophore-
sis tank, Wide Mini, Singapore). PCR amplicons were visualized
under UV illumination (Wise-UV Wuv-L50, DAIHAN Scien-
tiﬁc, Seoul, Korea). The 16S rRNA, nuc and mecA genes were
visualized at 750, 279, and 310 bp, respectively (Figure 1).

Detection of staphylococcal enterotoxin genes

Detection of enterotoxin genes was performed by multi-
plex PCR according to previously published primer sequences
(Mehrotra, Wang, & Johnson, 2000). S. aureus National Collection
of Type Cultures (NCTC) 10652 (sea positive), S. aureus NCTC
10654 (seb positive), S. aureus NCTC 10655 (sec positive), S. aureus
NCTC 10656 (sed and sea positive), and ATCC 27664 (see posi-
tive) were used as positive controls. The PCR reaction mixtures
and ampliﬁcation conditions were done as described above for the
16S rRNA, nuc and mecA genes. For the detection of enterotoxin
genes, 0.4 μM sea, seb, sec, and see primers, 0.8 μM sed primers,
and 2.5 U Taq-Polymerase were used. After electrophoresis, sea,
seb, sec, sed, and see genes were visualized at 102, 164, 451, 278,
and 209 bp, respectively.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 11 software for
Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, U.S.A.) to evaluate Staphylococ-
cus spp. counts in milk and dairy products. Signiﬁcant differences
were assessed by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s test. P-
values less than 0.05 were regarded statistically signiﬁcant.

1 × 102 CFU/g, the acceptable limit according to Turkish Food
Codex, in 65% of milk samples, 58% of clotted cream samples,
and 20% of cheese samples. Fifty-two percent of the 200 examined
samples were found to exceed the speciﬁed limits (Anonymous,
2011). In a previous study, Costa et al. (2012) reported a higher
proportion (40%) of cheese samples exceeding the acceptable limits
for CPS compared to our results.

On the other hand, Can and Celik (2012) found lower results
in the cheese samples they examined and found that 9.5% ex-
ceeded the acceptable limits. The reason for differences of CPS
incidence may be due to using raw or unpasteurized milk in the
dairy production, poor personnel hygiene, or cross contamination.

Prevalence of S. aureus

S. aureus was detected in 56 of 200 (28%) samples. As shown
in Table 2, among the S. aureus positive samples, 30 (30%) were
obtained from milk, nine (18%) were from clotted cream, and 17
(34%) were from cheese in this study. A total of 555 Staphylococcus
spp. presumptive colonies was obtained from BP agar. These iso-
lates were conﬁrmed for the presence of 16S rRNA and nuc gene.
A total of 283 of isolates from 126 samples showed ampliﬁcation
of the 750 bp region of the 16S rRNA gene for Staphylococcus
spp. and 99 isolates from 56 samples showed ampliﬁcation of the
279 bp region of the nuc gene (Figure 1). Among these nuc gene
positive S. aureus isolates, 57 were obtained from milk, 9 from
clotted cream, and 33 from cheese (Table 2).

The highest prevalence of S. aureus was found in cheese (34%),
followed by milk (30%); the least frequently contaminated product
was clotted cream (18%). Statistical evaluation showed that there
were signiﬁcant differences (P < 0.05) of the presence of S. aureus
in the milk, clotted cream, and cheese samples.

The results of our study are similar to those of other researchers
who found a S. aureus prevalence of 28% to 33% in buffalo milk
(Abo-Shama, 2014; Pamuk, Yildirim, Seker, Gurler, & Kara, 2012;
Sharma, Sharma, & Malik, 2011; Singh & Prakash, 2010). In
another study conducted by Alisarli and Solmaz (2010), S. aureus
was detected in 38% of teat skin samples. However, Rahimi and
Alian (2013) found S aureus in 17.5% of buffalo milk, which is a
lower rate than that found in the present study. On the other hand,
other studies have demonstrated higher isolation (75% to 96.2%)
rates in cow and goat milk samples than the counts presented
here (Jorgensen et al., 2005; Rall et al., 2008). The reason for the
different rates might be that milk was obtained from dairy animals
with mastitis, or due to differences in milking hygiene, milking
equipment, storage conditions, and transportation of the milk.

In the present study, S. aureus was identiﬁed in 17 of 50 (34%)
cheese samples. This result is in agreement with those reported
by other investigators (Manfreda, Mioni, & De Cesare, 2005).
However, in contrast to our study, Andre et al. (2008) detected
S. aureus in 70.8% of cheese samples in Brazil and Basanisi et al.
(2016) found S. aureus in 41.1% from goat and sheep cheese sam-
ples in Italy. The reason for this might be due to the use of raw milk
from unhealthy animals, inadequate pasteurization during home-
made traditional cheese production, contaminated cheese-making
equipment, and improper food handling.

In our study, the lowest prevalence of S. aureus contamination
was found in clotted cream (18%). This may have occurred since,
during the preparation of clotted cream, high heat (90 °C to
95 °C) treatment is applied. This treatment might be effective
at inactivating bacteria in milk. These results are in agreement
with the data reported in the other study by Mashouf, Hosseini,
Mousavi, and Arabestani (2015).

Detection of enterotoxin genes . . .

Prevalence of the mecA gene

Genotypic detection of methicillin resistance of S. aureus isolates
was determined by the presence of mecA gene. The presence of
MRSA in food is not routinely investigated. Therefore, limited
data about the prevalence and genetic spread of MRSA in dairy
products are present. In our study, the mecA gene was detected in
9 (9%) of 99 of the S. aureus isolates from milk (8 isolates) and
cheese samples (one isolate), but it was not detected in clotted
cream samples.

Similar to the ﬁndings of our study, a study conducted in Afyon,
Turkey, by Pamuk et al. (2012) reported that out of 360 buffalo
milk and milk products samples, 9 (9.2%) of the 97 S. aureus isolates
were genetically carrying mecA gene. In contrast to our study, Nam
et al. (2011) reported that, out of 402 S. aureus isolates obtained
from mastitic milk cows in Korea, 17 (4.2%) were genotypically
MRSA. In another study conducted by Normanno et al. (2007a),
the mecA gene was detected in six (0.4%) of 160 S. aureus isolates
(from milk, dairy products, meat, and meat products) in Italy.

Prevalence of staphylococcal enterotoxin genes

Enterotoxin genes were detected in 12 out of 99 (12%) isolates.
Among these, ﬁve (5/12; 41.6%) of them (two from milk and
three from cheese) were positive for sea, 2 (2/12; 16.6%, from
milk) were positive for sec, 1 (1/12; 8.3%, from clotted cream) was
positive for sed, one (1/12; 8.3%, from milk) was positive for see,
and three (3/12; 25%, from milk) were positive for sec + sed. None
of the samples were positive for seb (Table 2, Figure 2).

study,

In this

the results

show that 12% (12/99) of

the
S. aureus isolates obtained from buffalo milk and dairy products
were found SEs positive (possessed one or two genes). These re-
sults are similar to previous studies, such as the work of Neder,
Canavesio, and Calvinho (2011) who found that 11.76% of S. au-
reus isolates obtained from milk samples in Argentina were entero-
toxigenic. Kuplulu, Sarimehmetoglu, and Celik (2004) reported
that 35 (16.4%) of 214 cheese samples were contaminated with en-
terotoxigenic staphylococci species in Turkey. Similar values were
detected by Korpysa-Dzirba and Osek (2014). It was found that
20 (11.9%) out of 168 S. aureus isolates were positive for one or
more classical se genes. However, contrary to our study, Ertas,
Gonulalan, Yildirim, and Kum (2010) found enterotoxin genes
(sea, seb, sec, sed) in 13 (3.02%) out of 80 isolates from sheep cheese
and dairy-based desserts. The presence of SEs, the expression of
enterotoxin genes, was identiﬁed in 12 (2.8%) out of 80 isolates by
using the ELISA technique. In the study of Carfora et al. (2015),
77 colonies of 93 were found positive for the “classical SEs” coding
genes (sea, seb, sec, or sed) by PCR. The SEs/SEls genes most fre-
quently detected were sed, present in 40% of the isolates, followed
by sec (34.3%).

Our results indicate that the most frequently isolated entero-
toxin gene was sea (41.6%), similar to the other studies (Dores,
Dias, Arcuri, Nobrega, & Ferreira, 2013; Mashouf et al., 2015;
Morandi, Brasca, Lodi, Cremonesi, & Castiglioni, 2007). In agree-
ment to our study, Rall et al. (2008) reported that in the raw milk
isolates the gene sea was the most frequent (16 isolates, 41%),
followed by sec (eight isolates, 20.5%), sed (ﬁve isolates, 12.8%),
seb (three isolates, 7.7%), and see (two isolates, 5.1%). SEA, either
alone or together with other SEs/SEls, is the most common cause
of staphylococcal food poisoning worldwide (Do Carmo et al.,
2004). Many studies have reported that SEA, SEC, and SED type
toxins are the most commonly produced toxins in milk and dairy
products (Jorgensen et al., 2005; Morandi et al., 2007; Neder et al.,
2011; Normanno et al., 2007b).

In our study, interestingly, see gene was detected in 8.3% of
tested isolates. Several other studies reported that none of tested S.
aureus isolates from milk and dairy products harbored the see gene
(Arcuri et al., 2010; Carfora et al., 2015; Jorgensen et al., 2005;
Poli et al., 2007; Zouharova & Rysanek, 2008). SEE has been
rarely reported in foods, and its existence in staphylococcal food
poisoning outbreaks has only been determined in rare occasions.
However, this enterotoxin has also been associated with outbreaks
in the United States and other countries (Arcuri et al., 2010;
Carfora et al., 2015; Ostyn et al. 2010; Wieneke, Roberts, &
Gilbert, 1993).

Our data show that the seb gene was not detected in any of
the isolates. Different from our study, Gucukoglu et al. (2013)
reported that in the ice cream isolates, the most frequently detected
enterotoxin gene was seb (n = 9, 69.2%) followed by sea (n = 1,
7.6%), sed (n = 1, 7.6%), seb + sed (n = 1, 7.6%), and sea + seb +
sed (n = 1, 7.6%), respectively. The sec gene was not detected in
any of these isolates.

Moreover, contrary to our study, Dores et al. (2013) found the
presence of the seb gene in one isolate only and they reported
that all other genes (sea, sec, sed, and see) were not detected in any
isolate. Several studies described that none of the investigated iso-
lates from bovine and goat milk and dairy products harbored the
gene seb (Akineden et al., 2001; Lyra et al., 2013; Pexara, Solo-
makos, Sergelidis, Angelidis, & Govaris, 2016). In other studies,
however, the seb gene was detected in S. aureus isolates from milk
and dairy products at various frequencies (Arcuri et al., 2010; Jor-
gensen et al., 2005; Peles et al., 2007; Rall et al., 2008; Zouharova
& Rysanek, 2008). The prevalence of enterotoxin-producing S.
aureus isolates in milk and dairy products samples differs among
studies. This might be due to differences in the source of sampling,
and geographical differences.

Conclusion

The results of this study showed that buffalo milk and its prod-
ucts were contaminated with enterotoxigenic and MRSA. Fur-
thermore, the most frequently enterotoxin gene was sea. The
presence of S. aureus in raw milk and products may be considered
a potential health risk for food poisoning. Therefore, it is rec-
ommended that consuming raw milk and low heat-treated milk
products should be avoided.
