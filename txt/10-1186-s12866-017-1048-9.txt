Abstract
Background: Staphylococcus aureus is one of the leading causes of gastroenteritis acquired from contaminated
foods such as milk and milk products. However, such information is limited in Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was
conducted to assess the contamination of milk with S. aureus and knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of
actors along the milk value chain in Sebeta, Central Oromia, Ethiopia. A total of 291 samples collected from dairy
farms, milk collection centers (MCCs) and processing plant were examined using standard microbiological
techniques. The antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of the isolates were also investigated. The KAP of actors in milk
value chain were evaluated through a structured questionnaire.
Results: Overall, 23.4% (n = 68) of the samples were positive for S. aureus. The prevalence of S. aureus was 19.6%
(95% CI: 14.5–25.6) and 80.0% (95% CI: 14.5–25.6) at farm level and MCCs, respectively. Higher isolation rate was
observed in the MCCs (p = 0.000) than the farms. The contamination rates of hands of milkers’ and milking buckets
with S. aureus were 32% and 11.1%, respectively. S. aureus was not isolated from pasteurized milk samples. The
isolates were found to be resistant to cefoxitin (100%), penicillin G (98.5%), and streptomycin (77.9%). Among 23
interviewed farmers, 35% of them consumed raw milk, none of them wash their hands and 82.6% did not wash
udder and teat before milking. Six percent of consumers had the habit of raw milk consumption. Eighty seven
percent of dairy farmers and 54% of consumers had no awareness about milk borne diseases and staphylococcal
food poisoning.
Conclusions: The study revealed a high prevalence of S. aureus along the milk value chain, poor milk handling
practices, raw milk consumption behavior, lack of awareness about milk borne diseases and occurrence of
antimicrobials resistant S. aureus. S. aureus seems to pose a public health risk in Sebeta. Authors recommended the
urgent need of public awareness creation about the importance of hygienic milk production and proper handling
and adequate heat treatment of milk before consumption and further study to assess cost-effective preventive and
control options.

Background
Foodborne diseases are among the most widespread
public health problems globally. Food normally becomes
a potential source of human infection due to contamin-
ation during production, collection, transportation and
preparation or during processing [1]. Globally,
food-
borne illinesses are responsible for an estimated 600 mil-
lion cases and 420,000 deaths [2]. Among bacteria
predominantly incriminated as causes of foodborne dis-
eases, S. aureus is one of the leading cause of gastro-
enteritis, which results from the consumption of food
contaminated
[3].
Staphylococcal food poisoning (SFP) is one of the com-
mon causes of the foodborne illnesses in many parts of
the world. In united states, it was estimated that 240,000
cases of SFP occur each year leading to hospitalization
in 1000 cases and death of six people [4]. Similarly, 386
outbreaks in Europe were due to SFP [5]. In France, 300
[6] and in Japan 13,420 [7] cases of food borne outbreak
were also reported to be due to SFP. Developing coun-
tries bear most of food borne diseases including SFP
even though there are no reliable estimates [8].

staphylococcal

enterotoxins

by

Staphylococcus aureus starts to produce the entero-
toxin when the population density in milk reaches about
106.5 cfu/ml [9]. Enterotoxin producing S. aureus are
dangerous and harmful for the human health, and about
50% of the strains of this pathogen are able to produce
enterotoxins that are able to cause food poisoning [10].
A small amount of staphylococcal enterotoxin, ranging
from 100 to 200 ng, can cause illness [11].

Milk is highly vulnerable to bacterial contamination, be-
cause it supports the growth and multiplication of patho-
genic organisms leading to food spoilage,
foodborne
infection and poisoning [12]. Although pasteurization or
boiling of milk is likely to destroy all pathogens including
S. aureus, public health concern arises when either milk is
consumed raw or pasteurization is not efficient [13]. Con-
sumption of raw milk and raw milk products including
cheese, cream, butter and yoghurt is common in sub-
Saharan Africa including Ethiopia [14]. In Ethiopia, more-
over, production and consumption of raw milk and vari-
ous dairy products often takes place under unsatisfactory
hygiene conditions [15]. As a result, the possibility of SFP
due to the consumption of dairy products is highly likely
[11, 16]. Studies conducted in Ethiopia have indicated the
occurrence of S. aureus in milk at various points of milk
value chain that might be attributed to contamination
from mastitic cow, cross-contamination with contami-
nated milk from infected farm at collection centers, poor
handling practices and use of unhygienic equipment [17,
18]. In a previous study, S. aureus was identified as a main
cause of mastitis in cows in Sebeta, one of the milk shed
areas near to Addis Ababa [17]. However, a study about
the occurrence of this pathogen along milk value chain at

each critical point is absent. To fill the information gap,
we assessed the occurrence of S. aureus and the anti-
microbial sensitivity patterns of the isolates. Besides, the
knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of actors along
the milk value chain were investigated.

Methods
Study area and study population
The study was conducted in Sebeta town South West
Showa Sebeta district from November 2014 to March
2015. The town is separate district,
located in the
Oromia Special Zone surrounding Finfinne (Addis
Ababa) of the Oromia Region. Sebeta town is located
24 km south west of Addis Ababa at a geographical co-
ordinate of 8°55′N 38° 37′E latitude and 8.917 °N 38.617
°E longitude and an altitude of 2780 meters above sea
level. Majority of the dairy farms in the area are kept
under small holder intensive farms and animal products,
especially dairy products, play a headstone role in house-
hold food security both by direct consumption and pur-
chasing of other food items in the area (CSA, 2011). It
has an estimated total human population of 49,331of
which 24,356 were males and 24,975 were females [19].
There is only one private commercial dairy farm and pro-
cessing plant that produces milk. The plant also collects
milk from nearby smallholder dairy farmers. The plant
collects and process about 6300 L milk on average daily.
There are no government owned dairy farms and all the
farms were owned by smallholder dairy farmers [16].

Sample size and sampling
Milk samples were taken from individual cows, milk col-
lection centers (MCCs) and processing plant and swab
samples were taken from milking buckets and milker’s
hands. The samples were assumed to represent the crit-
ical points along the milk value chain. The samples were
collected and processed during 1 December - 30 April,
2015. About 15 samples were collected per week. The
number of cows included in our study was determined
using the recommended formula [20] assuming 95%
level of confidence (CL), 5% desired level of precision
and expected prevalence of 16% [21]. Accordingly, 209
milk samples were collected from individual cows. The
dairy cows were randomly selected from 23 dairy farms.
Four MCCs were also randomly selected and labeled
from the total of 19 MCCs from which 20 milk samples
were collected proportionally according to the number
of bulk tanks.

Ten pasteurized milk samples were taken from the
milk processing plant. In addition, 52 swab samples from
27 milker’s hand and from 25 milk buckets were col-
lected. Overall, 291 samples were included in the study
to isolate and identify S. aureus. In addition, a total of
110 actors in the milk value chain comprising of 23

dairy farm owners, 1 processing plant worker, 19 milk
collectors, 17 hotel/cafe workers and 50 consumers were
included in the study. Written consent of the partici-
pants were solicited and obtained. The research was
conducted after the proposal was presented and ap-
proved by the ethical clearance committee of the college.

Isolation and identification
Cow’s udder and teats were first cleaned with soap and
dried using clean towels and then the teats were disin-
fected with 70% alcohol before sampling. The fore strip
milk was discarded and composite milk samples (10 ml)
were taken from each cow. Swabs from hands of the
milking personnel and milking bucket were collected
using sterile, cotton-tipped swabs. After agitating the
bulk tank milk, sample was taken from the top of bulk
milk using a sanitized dipper from MCCs. Pasteurized
milk was purchased from the milk processing plant.
Milk samples (10 ml) from individual cows, milk sam-
ples from collection centers (10 ml), and 10 packs of
pasteurized milk form processing plants were trans-
ported to the Microbiology Laboratory of College of
Veterinary Medicine and Agriculture of Addis Ababa
University, Bishoftu by keeping in icebox containing ice
packs. Upon arrival, the collected samples were immedi-
ately stored at 4 °C for a maximum of 24 h until cultur-
ing the next day.

The bacteriological culture was performed following the
standard microbiological technique [22]. A loopful of milk
sample using inoculating needle was streaked on sterile
5% sheep blood agar (Oxoid, UK) and swab samples were
streaked on blood agar media using cotton applicator and
the plates were incubated aerobically at 37 °C and exam-
ined after 24–48 h of incubation. The colonies were iden-
tified based on morphological characteristics, hemolytic
pattern and Gram’s staining reaction. The representative
colonies which were positive for Gram’s staining and typ-
ical grapes like structure under microscope were further
sub-cultured on nutrient agar plates (Oxoid, UK) and in-
cubated at 37 °C for 24 h. pure colonies were preserved
and maintained
further
characterization of the isolates. Eventually, identification
of the agent was done based on biochemical tests such as
catalase, coagulase, mannitol salt agar and purple agar
base tests. Samples were considered positive for S. aureus
when the isolates were catalase and coagulase positive and
showed fermentation of mannitol and maltose (strong yel-
low discoloration of both media).

was dipped into the standardized suspension of the bac-
terial culture, squeezed against the sides of the test tube
to remove the excess fluid and inoculated into Mueller-
Hinton agar and allowed to dry the flood. Thereafter,

trimethoprim [25 μg], ciprofloxacin [5 μg], nalidixic acid
[30 μg], amoxicillin [10 μg], cefoxitin [30 μg], erythro-

the agar with forceps and gently pressed down to ensure
contact. The plates were then allowed to stand for

Plates were inverted and incubated at 35-37 °C for
24 h. An inhibition zone diameter of each antimicrobial
was then measured and interpreted as ‘resistant’, ‘inter-
mediate,’ and ‘sensitive’ by comparing with recorded
diameters of a control organism, ATCC25923 [24].

Questionnaire survey
A pre-tested structured questionnaire was used to assess
the knowledge, attitude and practices of study partici-
pants related to handling and consumption of milk in
the study area. A total of 110 actors in the milk value
chains were interviewed.

Data management and analysis
Data were entered into excel spread sheet and analyzed
using SPSS statistical software version 20. Frequency
tables were used to present the data. Chi-square test,
Fischer’s exact test and descriptive statistics were used to
analyze the data. The significance level was set at α = 0.05.

Results
Prevalence of S. aureus
Among 291 samples examined, 23.4% (68) were positive.
Of this, 19.6% (95% CI: 14.5–25.6%, 41/209) and 80.0%
(95%CI: 56.3–94.3%, 16/20) were positive for S. aureus at
farm and milk collection centers level, respectively. But, S.
aureus was not isolated from any of the pasteurized milk
samples taken from the processing plant. Among the four
MCCs, high contamination rate (100%) was observed at
milk collection centers labeled as 3 and 7. There was sta-
tistically a significant difference in the isolation rate
among the milk collection centers (P < 0.05) (Table 1).
The study has also showed relatively a higher contamin-
ation rate of S. aureus at MCCs than farm. There was
statistically a significant variation (P < 0.05).

S. aureus was found in 32% (n = 8) of the total 25

addition, among the 27 milking bucket swab samples,
11.1% (n = 3) yielded S. aureus. However, S. aureus was
not isolated from any of the pasteurized milk samples
taken from the processing plant.

Antimicrobial susceptibility
All the 68 isolates were from (cow milk at farm, milk at
MCCs, hand and bucket swabs) of S. aureus were tested
for antimicrobial susceptibility to 10 selected antibiotics.
The isolates were highly susceptible to ciprofloxacin
(82.4%),
followed by sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim
(67.6%) and nalidixic acid (42.6%), however, they were
highly resistant to cefoxitin (100%), penicillin G (98.5%),
streptomycin (77.9%), erythromycin (69.1%), and tetra-
cycline (64.7%) (Table 2).

Knowledge, attitudes and practices
Among the total of 23 interviewed dairy farmers, 35%
(n = 8) of them consume raw milk. The consumption of
raw milk is relatively higher among uneducated dairy
farmers (38.5%, 5/13) than those who at least read and
write (30%, 3/10). Only 13% of the dairy farmers were
aware of the occurrence of foodborne diseases due to
raw milk consumption, but none of them have aware of

staphylococcal food poisoning associated with consump-
tion of raw milk and milk products. Among 87%
(n = 20) of farmers who had no aware of food poisoning,
40% (8/20) of them had habit of consuming raw milk.
Of the 23 farmers, 60.9%, 21.7% and 17.4% of them prac-
ticed cleaning of barn twice, more than two times and
once per day, respectively, however, 82.6% (n = 19)
didn’t wash udder and teat and none of them did wash
their hands before milking using anti septic solutions.
On the other hand, all of them practiced washing of
dairy equipment with hot water and detergents (example
soap) before milking. All of the dairy farmers used plas-
tic containers for both milking and milk storage.

Among the 50 consumers, 88% (n = 44) of the inter-
viewed consumers drink boiled milk while 12% (n = 6)
consume raw milk and raw milk products like yogurt.
Fifty four percent of them (n = 27) had no aware of milk
borne disease associated with drinking raw milk and
none of the respondents had knowledge about staphylo-
coccal food poisoning. Of the consumers, 58% (n = 29),
24% (n = 12) and 18% (n = 9) of them purchased milk
from farms, cafe and from MCCs, respectively. Sixty six
percent of them (n = 33) used plastic containers while
the rest (n = 17) used metallic containers to transport
milk to their homes. Ten percent of them kept milk in a
refrigerator while 90% (n = 45) of them kept milk at
room temperature. All of the interviewed hotels/ cafes
(n = 17) purchased raw milk from farms. Among them,
29% (n = 5) used metallic container while 71% (n = 12)
used plastic containers for milk transportation. On the
other hand, the respondents (hotels/cafes owners) indi-
cated that they used different methods of quality assess-
ments like boiling (47%) and visualizing and smelling 5
(29.4%) before purchasing milk. The rest 23.6% (n = 4)
of
them directly buy the milk without undertaking

quality assessment. Milk was found to be kept in a re-
frigerator by all hotels/cafes until consumption. Twenty
seven percent (27%) of the consumers had no aware of
the occurrence of milk borne diseases associated with
drinking raw milk and none of the respondents had
aware of staphylococcal food poisoning.

At the MCCs, milk from dairy farmers was checked
using lactometer reading and an alcohol test for its
freshness. Only those milk samples passed the tests were
collected from the farmers. Among 19 milk collection
centers, 78.9% (n = 15) used plastic cans to collect milk.
The cans were cleaned with soda ash and hot water at
the processing plant and dispatched to the MCCs by ve-
hicles used for transportation of milk to the plant. All
the daily collected milk at each milk collection center
was used by processing plant to produce pasteurized
milk and milk products.

The processing plant, a modern commercial milk pro-
cessing plant applying milk pasteurization techniques
with good manufacturing practices, is located in Sebeta
town. Laboratory tests namely petri-film paper test as a
rapid microbial quality indicator test was conducted by
the plant
immediately up on arrival. Besides, milk
samples were further subjected to the lactometer reading
and alcohol test prior to processing. All the daily milk
samples tested and accepted were processed to produce
pasteurized milk,
and
aluminum covered cartons were used for packaging of
pasteurized milk.

Discussion
In this study, from 209 lactating cow milk samples sub-
jected to bacteriological examination, 19.6% (41/209)
were found to be positive for S. aureus. This finding is
nearly in agreement with the findings observed in Addis
Ababa, 21.13% [25] and 16.2% [21]. However, the result
of the present study showed a slight lower contamin-
ation rate compared to other works, 29.1% [26], 27%
[27], 44% [14] and 75% [28]. This may be attributed to
differences in the management practices at farm level.

In the present study, 80% (16/20) of the bulk milk sam-
ples from the MCCs were found to be contaminated with
S. aureus. The results showed a higher contaminated bulk
milk of MCCs with S. aureus than farm milk. This might
be attributed to cross contamination of milk while bulking
and poor handling during transportation from farm to col-
lection centers and at milk collection centers [29]. The
contamination of S. aureus at collection centers was
nearly in agreement with the previous work [14, 27] where
S. aureus was isolated at recovery rate of 75% and 72%, re-
spectively. But, this finding was relatively lower when
compared with the report by Addis et al. [29] from which
they recovered 46% of S. aureus from milk at MCCs. We
observed a significant increase of milk contamination with

S. aureus from farms (19.6% to milk collection centers
(80% %); this might be due to mixing of milk from mastitic
cows and/or poor handling.

In this study, none of the pasteurized milk samples
yielded S. aureus. This shows that S. aureus were inacti-
vated during pasteurization process and this indicates
the absence of post pasteurization contamination and
cross contamination during packaging [1]. This is further
supported by the fact that Staphylococcus species can be
easily eliminated from foods by heat treatment [30].

The isolation of S. aureus from hands of milker’s and
milk buckets were 32% and 11.1%, respectively. These
clearly indicated that milk handlers and milk buckets
could be the potential sources of contamination of milk
with S. aureus. The isolation rate from milker’s hand
was relatively in agreement with the prevalence rate re-
ported by Deandrade and Zelante [31] and Tondo et al.
[32] whose results were 35.7% and 35.2%, respectively.
This may be attributed to the fact that staphylococci are
ubiquitous organisms and at least 50% of individuals
carry the organism in their nasal passages, throat and
through coughing or sneezing. They can also contamin-
ate their hands and the variation might be due to differ-
ences in milk handling, hand washing and buckets and
teats/udder washing practices [33].

The antimicrobial susceptibility tests carried out in
this study indicated the occurrence of resistance of S.
aureus to some of the commonly used antimicrobials.
This study presents the sensitivity of the S. aureus iso-
lates towards ciprofloxacin (82.4%), SXT (67.6%) and
nalidixic acid (42.6%). However, the isolates were found
to be highly resistant to cefoxitin (100%) and penicillin
G (98.85%). The high resistance pattern of the isolates to
penicillin G was relatively similar to the findings re-
ported from different countries: 96.7% [21], 87.2% [34]
in Ethiopia and 80% in Sweden [35]. But, it was in con-
trast to the other findings reported by [36–38] who re-
ported 23% in West India, 57% in Iran and 50% in
Finland of resistance to penicillin G, respectively. This is
probably due to resistance to β-lactams and frequent use
of the antibiotics. Moreover, the present study showed
moderate resistance pattern of S. aureus to streptomycin
(77.9%),
(64.7%)
followed by vancomycin (64.7%). The findings are incon-
sistent with the report of Abera et al. [39] in which
20.6%, 44.8% and 72.4% of resistance level is observed
for tetracycline, streptomycin and vancomycin, respect-
ively. This is due to the fact these drugs specifically
tetracycline and streptomycin are commonly used in the
treatment of infections in the study area. Lacks of strin-
gent regulation and monitoring in the dispensing and

Antibiotic therapy is an important tool in the treat-
ment of S. aureus related infections. However,
the
misuse or intensive use of antibiotics can lead to the
development of resistance among different bacterial
strains [40].

The current study revealed that, 82.6% of the farmers
didn’t wash udder and teat of the cows before milking and
all of them didn’t wash their hands using antiseptics but
all washed equipment with hot water and soap (Ajax)
before milking. This is in agreement with the report of
[41] where many farmers did not sufficiently clean their
hands and udder before milking. These practices com-
bined with the observation of the occurrence of S. aureus
on hands of milkers’ and milk buckets indicated that
farmers have no knowledge on the importance of good
milking practices in minimizing microbial contamination
of milk raising the public health issues. Yet pre-milking
udder preparation and employing good milk handling
practices play an important role in minimizing contamin-
ation at the farm with S. aureus [14, 15].

In the present study, the use of plastic containers for
milking, storing, collecting and transporting at farm, milk
collection centers and by the processing plant was ob-
served. Plastic containers have inherent characteristics
that make them unsuitable for milk handling. Plastic con-
tainers scratch easily and provide hiding places for bac-
teria during cleaning and sanitization and poor conductor
heat and hence will hinder effective sanitization by heat
leading to bacterial contamination of the milk [42–44].

Among the farmers, 35% had a habit of drinking raw
milk and 87% of them didn’t have awareness about food
borne diseases associated with consumption of raw milk.
A study in the USA similarly reported that 42.3% of
dairy producers consumed raw milk [45] and other find-
ings also substantiated the raw milk consumption behav-
ior among dairy farmers [11, 16, 17]. Similar to the
farmers, 28% of milk consumers drink milk in the form
of raw milk and raw milk products like yogurt and 54%
of them has no awareness of milk borne diseases. Find-
ings of this study showed that the level of knowledge
and awareness of health risks associated with drinking
milk by consumers was low when compared with results
(20.6%) reported by Karimuribo et al. [46]. Consumers
form the last group of the food chain and therefore they
are at risk of any malpractice occurring in the chain.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the present study revealed the occurrence
of contamination of milk with S. aureus along the milk
value chain at farm and milk collection centers. The re-
covery of the bacteria from hands of milkers’ and milk
buckets were found to be the potential sources of milk
contamination with this pathogen at the farm. The high
prevalence of S. aureus at MCCs might indicate cross

contamination of milk while bulking and poor handling
during transportation from farm to collection centers
and at milk collection centers. The study also revealed
poor milk handling practices, raw milk consumption be-
havior, inadequate knowledge of milk borne disease and
occurrence of antimicrobials resistant S. aureus. In gen-
eral, the study has revealed the possibility of the public
health risk posed by S. aureus in Sebeta town. Creation
of public awareness about good milk handling practices,
milk borne diseases and their prevention is important.
In addition monitoring rational use of drugs and peri-
odic assessment of the antimicrobial sensitivity of drugs
prior use are recommended. What is more, future stud-
ies should consider investigation and designing of cost-
effective preventive and control options that would
enable to reduce milk contamination by S. aureus and
thereby the associated public health risks.
