Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of multidrug resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) 
in dairy products. Methods: Isolation and identification of S. aureus were performed in 3 dairy-
based food products. The isolates were tested for their susceptibility to 5 different common 
antimicrobial drugs. Results: Of 50 samples examined, 5 (10%) were contaminated with S. 
aureus. Subsequently, the 5 isolates were subjected to antimicrobial resistance pattern using five 
antibiotic discs (methicillin, vancomycin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline). Sample 
29 showed resistance to methicillin and vancomycin. Sample 18 showed intermediate response to 
tetracycline. The other samples were susceptible to all the antibiotics tested. Conclusions: The 
results provide preliminary data on sources of food contamination which may act as vehicles for 
the transmission of antimicrobial-resistant Staphylococcus. Therefore, it enables us to develop  
preventive strategies to avoid the emergence of new strains of resistant S. aureus. 

1. Introduction
   Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a versatile pathogen 
in humans and animals which is responsible for a diverse 
spectrum of diseases ranging from minor skin infections 
to life threatening diseases, such as pneumonia and 
meningitis[1]. It is also known as one of the most important 
agents of food poisoning globally[2]. It has been believed 
that all bacterial infections were treatable with a vast 
array of effective and antimicrobial agents. However, the 
emergence of resistance to multiple antibiotics among S. 
aureus has created breaking news for health practitioners 
and researchers[3]. It has been reported that shortly after the 
introduction of penicillin in 1940s, resistance developed in 
S. aureus, followed by resistance to methicillin and more 
recently to glycopeptides, e.g., vancomycin[4].
    S. aureus can be transmitted to humans through 
contaminated and untreated milk and milk products[5]. S. 
aureus presents on the skin and mucosae of food producing 
animal reservoirs that include ruminants and it is frequently 
associated with sub-clinical or clinical mastitis leading to 
the contamination of dairy products[8]. This bacterium is 
considered as the most commonly occurring major pathogen

of cow's mammary gland[6]. 
   The objective of this study was to isolate S. aureus from 
dairy products which include fresh cow milk, pasteurized 
milk, goat milk, yogurt and cheese, to characterize S. aureus 
using conventional methods like Gram staining, coagulase 
test and catalase test and also to determine the prevalence 
of antimicrobial resistance among S. aureus isolated from 
dairy products.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study population and sample collection
   A total of 50 dairy samples (12 fresh cow milk samples, 13 
pasteurized milk samples, 13 goat milk samples, 6 yogurt 
samples and 6 cheese samples) from various places in 
Kedah, Malaysia, were analyzed from September 2007 to 
November 2007. The samples were collected at dairy farms, 
groceries and hypermarkets. The samples were refrigerated 
at 4 曟 before subjected to microbiological analysis.
2.2. Bacteriological examinations
   Isolation and identification of S. aureus were performed 
according to the National Mastitis Council recommendations 
on examination of quarter-milk samples[7]. Briefly, 
immediately after delivery, the milk samples were 
inoculated on blood agar plates (Difco, Detroit, MI) and

When those colonies were subjected to biochemical 
characterization which involves Gram staining, hemolysis 
coagulase and catalase test, only 5 samples showed positive 
result for all the three tests. The samples that were positive 
for S. aureus included 4 fresh cow milks and 1 pasteurized 
milk.

then on mannitol salt agar (Difco, USA) plates, which were 
divided into 4 sections. A 10-毺L loop was used to streak 
the milk sample, and 6 to 8 lines were made in one agar 
section. Samples were incubated for 24 to 72 h at 37 曟 
and examined for bacterial growth. Pure cultures were 
further examined for morphological (convex elevation and 
smooth margin), staining, and cultural characteristics, 
and for biochemical reactions according to standard keys. 
Staphylococci were studied in particular for hemolysis and 
coagulase production. Coagulase testing was performed 
according to a tube method using oxalated rabbit plasma 
in a 1:10 dilution in nutrient broth[8]. Only typical colonies 
identified as S. aureus were stored in cryogenic vials containing 
1 mL of trypticase soy broth with 15% glycerin at -80 曟.
2.3. Antibiotic susceptibility testing
   Before antibiotic susceptibility testing[9], the isolates were 
revived by subculturing on blood agar base (Difco) at 35 曟 
for 24 h. The isolates were tested for their susceptibility to 5 
different antimicrobial drugs: methicillin (Met), vancomycin 
(Van), kanamycin (Kan), chloramphenicol (Chl) and 
tetracycline (Tet). The antibiotic disks (Oxoid, Amsterdam, 
The Netherlands) were gently pressed to ensure their contact 
with the inoculated Mueller-Hinton agar surface, and the 
plates were incubated at 35 曟. The plates were examined 
after 18 h and the zones of inhibition were measured to 
the nearest millimeter. The interpretive breakpoints for 
resistance were determined according to the standard table 
provided by the manufacturer of the antibiotic disks, and 
the isolates were reported as susceptible, intermediate, 
or resistant. For quality control, S. aureus ATCC 25923 was 
used as control strain. It should be pointed out that the 
interpretive breakpoints used were originally developed for 
human infections.
2.4. Statistical analysis
   Analysis of susceptibility testing was by category 
agreement, where the zone diameters were divided into 
different categories (susceptible, intermediate, and 
resistant). Statistical significance of differences in resistance 
was evaluated using SPSS software (version 12). Univariant 
analysis was done to verify if the zone of inhibition means 
were affected by a single antibiotic. Comparison of the zones 
of inhibition between the samples was done. A P value <0.05 
was considered statistically significant.
3. Results
   A total of  50 milk samples from various sources were 
cultured for S. aureus, and (12, 24.0%) of the samples 
tested were from fresh cow milk samples, (13, 26.0%) from 
pasteurized milk, (13, 26.0%) from goat milk, (6, 12.0%) from 
yogurt and (6, 12.0%) from cheese samples. S. aureus was 
isolated from a total of 5 (10.0%) of the 50 samples.
3.1. Isolation and biochemical characterization of S. aureus
   From all the 50 samples, 35 samples had growth on 
tryptic blood agar (Figure 1a). When those colonies were 
subcultured, 21 samples had growth on the mannitol salt 
agar (Figure 1b) which is a selective media for S. aureus.

3.2. Susceptibility of S. aureus isolates
   Overall, 6.0% of the S. aureus isolates were susceptible 
to all of the antimicrobial agents tested (Table 1). All the S. 
aureus isolates from sample 2, 10 and 14 were susceptible to

methicillin, vancomycin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol and 
tetracycline. Of the 5 S. aureus isolates, isolate from sample 
29 was resistant to 2 antimicrobials drugs (methicillin and 
vancomycin) and isolate from sample 18 showed intermediate 
response to tetracycline (Table 1 and Figure 2). 
4. Discussion
   Food-borne diseases are an important public health 
problem as it not only affects human health, but also has a 
significant impact on economic and trade issues. The global 
changes affecting population growth, lifestyle, international 
food trade, food production and processing, agricultural and 
animal husbandry practices and antimicrobial resistance, 
have posed a threat to the emergence of food borne 
diseases. Food-borne diseases, especially dairy products 
infections, are not limited to the third world countries. Even 
in developed countries it has been reported that around 
2%-6% of the bacterial outbreaks, in which the food vehicle 
is known, were related to milk and dairy products[10].
   Improper food handling and unhygienic practices 
among food handlers during production, processing and 
distribution, have contributed to food poisoning episodes[11]. 
In Malaysia, the incidence of notifiable food-borne diseases, 
namely, cholera, typhoid, food poisoning, hepatitis A and 
dysentery, is less than 5/100 000 population sporadic in 
nature, and outbreaks are confined to certain areas only[12]. 
Hence this study was conducted to isolate S. aureus and 
determine the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among 
the isolates from the local dairy products.
   S. aureus exhibits some problematic features which are 
not found in other relevant bacteria. This bacterium is 
capable of expressing a variety of virulence factors and 
thus is considered medically relevant when encountered 
in dairy products. S. aureus continues to demonstrate the 
ability to develop and expand resistance to a broad array of 
antimicrobial classes[13]. It is a prominent pathogen in both 
the hospital and the community settings.
   With respect to the 5 dairy products studied, it showed 
that contamination occurs in fresh cow milk and pasteurized 
milk. Milking operations, including storage, handling 
and transportation, are considered as critical points that 
contaminate milk products. Susceptible populations of 
bacteria may become resistant to antimicrobial agents 
through mutation and selection or by the acquisition of new 
genetic material from other resistant organisms through 
transformation, transduction and conjugation. In sample 
number 29, S. aureus was resistant to multiple classes of 
antibiotics (methicillin and vancomycin), which can cause 
serious health problems[14]. The fact that resistance is high 
in environmental isolates is mainly because antimicrobials 
are frequently prescribed by veterinarians as treatment 
for gram-negative bacterial infections on farms[15]. Thus, 
the indiscriminate use of those antimicrobial agents might 
account, at least in part, for such a high resistance[15]. 
However, the assessment of cheeses and yogurt indicated 
that they do not contain satisfactory levels of S. aureus at the 
time of consumption. Staphylococcal food poisoning due to 
cheese and yogurt has not been reported to any great extent 
to the authorities[16].
   This research provides some important preliminary data 
about the contamination status of dairy-based food products 
in Kedah of Malaysia and the patterns of resistance of S. 

aureus isolates towards commonly used antimicrobials. 
The presence of multi-drug resistant strains is alarming, 
because such strains are considered a serious danger to 
public health. Additional research is required to better 
understand the ecology and evolution of bacterial resistance 
to antimicrobial agents in the environment as a whole.
Conflict of interest statement
   We declare that we have no conflict of interest.
