ABSTRACT

The objectives of this study were to determine antimi-
crobial resistance patterns of Staphylococcus aureus
strains isolated from bovine clinical mastitis cases and to
subtype the strains by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
technique based on coagulase gene polymorphism. Two
hundred sixty-ﬁve S. aureus isolates collected from indi-
vidual animals in different herds (n = 235) from 1995 to
2004 were tested for susceptibility to penicillin, ampicil-
lin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, oxacillin, oxytetracycline,
enroﬂoxacin, kanamycin-cephalexin, and trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole using the agar disc diffusion test.
Strains were also tested for β-lactamase production. A
total of 29.8% of the strains were susceptible to all anti-
microbial agents tested. The highest resistance was ob-
served in 63.3% of the strains against β-lactam antibiot-
ics, penicillin and ampicillin. Oxytetracycline resistance
was observed in 27.9% of the strains, either alone or in
combination with β-lactams. No resistance was detected
for amoxicillin-clavulanate, oxacillin, enroﬂoxacin and
kanamycin-cephalexin. β-Lactamase production and re-
sistance to β-lactam antibiotics were usually correlated.
Resistance against β-lactams increased from 43.5% in
1995 to 58 to 77% from 1999 to 2004.

One hundred twenty-ﬁve strains were examined for
coagulase gene polymorphism. The isolates were sub-
typed into 4 types by coagulase gene-based PCR. A pre-
dominant 1000-bp PCR product was observed in 60.8%
of the isolates typed. The results indicate that a few
coagulase gene types of S. aureus are responsible for the
majority of bovine clinical mastitis cases in one province
of Central Anatolia region, Turkey.

control measures, it is difﬁcult to eradicate the intra-
mammary infections caused by this pathogen and it re-
mains a substantial economic problem. Antimicrobial
therapy is one of the measures for controlling staphylo-
coccal mastitis. The cure rates for S. aureus mastitis
are affected by several factors, including antimicrobial
resistance of the isolates. The determination of antimi-
crobial susceptibility of clinical isolates is required not
only for therapy but also for monitoring the spread of
resistant strains throughout the populations. Although
antimicrobial susceptibility testing is a valuable tool in
determining the best therapeutic choice against a masti-
tis pathogen, in practice it is rarely performed and ther-
apy decisions are usually made empirically. Therefore,
susceptibility data for a large number of isolates in an
area or region can be useful to veterinarians (Salmon,
2002).

It is known that phenotypically and genotypically dif-
ferent many strains of S. aureus exist; however, there
is little information about distribution of the types of the
pathogen in herds and geographic locations. Previously,
several different phenotyping and genotyping tech-
niques have been applied for subtyping of S. aureus iso-
lates of both bovine and human origin, such as phage
typing (Zadoks et al., 2002; Vintov et al., 2003), plasmid
analysis (Aarestrup et al., 1995b; Lange et al., 1999),
ribotyping (Myllys et al., 1997), pulse-ﬁeld gel electro-
phoresis (Zadoks et al., 2002; Sabour et al., 2004),
multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (Kapur et al., 1995),
PCR-based ﬁngerprinting (Lipman et al., 1996; Fitzger-
ald et al., 1997, 2000), ampliﬁcation of speciﬁc gene re-
gions (Annemu¨ ller et al., 1999; Lange et al., 1999), and
binary typing (Zadoks et al., 2002). Unfortunately no
single technique is yet available that is superior to the
others (Tenover et al., 1994).

The coagulase protein is an important phenotypic de-
terminant and accepted as a major virulence factor of
S. aureus. Analysis of coagulase-encoding S. aureus DNA
(coa) genes has demostrated variable sequences in the
3′-end coding region (Goh et al., 1992). This region con-
tains a polymorphic repeat region that can be used to
differentiate S. aureus isolates. This characteristic has

been used to type S. aureus isolates of human and bovine
origin (Schwarzkopf and Karch, 1994; Aarestrup et al.,
1995a; Hookey et al., 1998; Annemu¨ ller et al., 1999;
Lange et al., 1999; Raimundo et al., 1999; Su et al., 1999;
Schlegelova et al., 2003).

Recently, many studies have been carried out on mo-
lecular epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance pat-
terns of bovine S. aureus isolates mainly from Europe
and the United States; however there are limited data
from Turkey. The aim of this study was to investigate
antimicrobial resistance patterns and epidemiological
relatedness using coagulase gene typing among S.
aureus strains isolated from bovine clinical mastitis
cases from 1995 to 2004 in one province of Central An-
atolia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Bacterial Strains

A total of 265 S. aureus strains isolated from milk
samples submitted to Konya Veterinary Control and Re-
search Institute diagnostic laboratory from 1995 to 2004
were examined. The strains were obtained from individ-
ual cows with clinical mastitis from different herds (n =
235) located in Konya province in Central Anatolia. Each
of 233 isolates was obtained from different herds; only
32 isolates were from 2 herds, with 27 and 5 isolates
from year 2000 and 2003, respectively.

Primary culture of milk samples was performed on
sheep blood agar plates. Isolates were identiﬁed using
standard microbiological techniques (Quinn et al., 1998)
and were stored at −70°C in trypticase soy broth con-
taining 15% glycerol. Coagulase test was performed us-
ing the staphylase test kit (Oxoid Limited, Hamp-
shire, UK).

β-Lactamase Production

All S. aureus isolates were tested for β-lactamase pro-
duction using the chromogenic cephalosporin method (β-
lactamase sticks; Oxoid Limited) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions.

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing

Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed on
Mueller Hinton agar by disk diffusion method (NCCLS
Standards, 2002) using the following antimicrobial
agents: penicillin (10 IU), ampicillin (10 μg), amoxicillin-
clavulanate (20 μg/10 μg), oxytetracycline (30 μg), en-
roﬂoxacin (5 μg), kanamycin-cephalexin (30 μg/45 μg),
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (1.25 μg/23.75 μg) and
oxacillin (1 μg). Reference strain S. aureus ATCC 25923
was used as the quality control organism and included

Journal of Dairy Science Vol. 88, No. 9, 2005

with each batch of isolates tested. For kanamycin-cepha-
lexin, no NCCLS criteria are available; ≥20 mm was
evaluated as susceptible. Inhibition zone of ATCC 25923
for kanamycin-cephalexin combination was 29 mm and
for oxytetracycline was within the range of the class
representative, tetracycline.

Coagulase Gene Typing

DNA extraction for PCR analysis. Staphylococcus
aureus DNA was extracted from overnight cultures in
10 mL of brain heart infusion broth with slight modiﬁca-
tions of the method reported by Hesselbarth and
Schwarz, 1995. Brieﬂy, bacterial cells were collected by
centrifugation for 30 s at 14,000 rpm, washed in 1 mL
of TES buffer (10 mM TrisⴢHCl, pH 8.0; 1 mM EDTA;
100 mM NaCl), and recentrifuged. The pellet was resus-
pended in 500 μL of TES buffer including 2 μL of lyso-
staphin (stock concentration 2 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) and 12.5 μg of lysozyme (AppliChem,
Darmstadt, Germany) and incubated for 30 min at 37°C.
Lysis was completed by the addition of 20 μL of 10% SDS
solution and incubation for 15 min at room temperature.
DNA was then extracted with phenol-chloroform-isoa-
mylalchohol 25:24:1 and chloroform-isoamylalchohol
24:1, respectively. The DNA was precipitated from the
supernatant with an equal volume of isopropanol at
−80°C for at least 1 h. After ﬁnal centrifugation, the
supernatant was discarded, the pellet was dried and
resuspended in 50 μL of ultrapure water.

PCR analysis. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of
the coa gene was carried out using the primers COAG2
(5′ CGAGACCAAGATTCAACAAG 3′) and COAG3 (5′
AAAGAAAACCACTCACATCA 3′) described by Goh et
al. (1992). Reaction was performed in a ﬁnal volume of
50 μL of mixture containing PCR buffer (10 mM
TrisⴢHCl, pH 9.0; 50 mM KCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100),
1.5 mM MgCl2, 250 μM each of the deoxynucleoside tri-
phosphates, 0.5 μM each of the coa gene-speciﬁc primers,
1.25 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI)
and 5 μL of template. The ampliﬁcation program in-
cluded an initial denaturation step of 2 min at 94°C
followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 2 min at 55°C and
4 min at 72°C, and a ﬁnal extension step of 7 min at
72°C (Lange et al., 1999). The products of 7 μL were
analyzed by electrophoresis through a 1.5% agarose gel
after which the gel was stained with ethidium bromide
and photographed.

Restriction endonuclease digestion. Seven microli-
ters of PCR product was incubated with 10 U of AluI
(Fermentas Int., Inc., Vilnius, Lithuania) at 37°C for
2 h. Ten microliters of the digested PCR product was
electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gel, stained with ethid-
ium bromide, and visualized under UV light.

RESULTS

All of the isolates were coagulase-test positive and
showed α and β-hemolysis in sheep blood agar and iden-
tiﬁed as S. aureus.

Antimicrobial Susceptibility

Antimicrobial susceptibility test results of 265 S.
aureus strains are shown in Tables 1 and 2. A total
of 79 (29.8%) S. aureus isolates were susceptible to all
antimicrobial agents tested. One hundred sixty-eight
(63.3%) of the strains were resistant to penicillin and
ampicillin. A total of 74 (27.9%) strains were resistant
to oxytetracycline, 18 (6.7%) of them alone, 56 (21.1%)
of them together with β-lactams, and 33.3% of penicillin-
resistant strains were resistant to oxytetracycline. Only
5 (1.8%) strains were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfa-
methoxazole. No resistance was detected for oxacillin,
amoxicillin-clavulanate, enroﬂoxacin, or kanamycin-
cephalexin. Distribution of penicillin-resistant strains
according to years is shown in Table 3. Among the 27
S. aureus isolates belonging to one herd, 10 strains were
sensitive to all antimicrobials tested, 10 strains were
resistant to penicillin, ampicillin plus oxytetracycline,
5 strains were resistant to only oxytetracycline, and 2
strains were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. How-
ever, 5 strains belonging to the other herd showed a

A total of 152 (57.3%) strains were positive for β-lacta-
mase test. Only 16 β-lactam antibiotics resistant strains
were β-lactamase negative.

Coagulase Gene Typing

The PCR ampliﬁcation of coagulase gene of 125 S.
aureus isolates distinguished 4 PCR products of approxi-
mately 1000, 900, 800, and 700 bp (Figure 1). The 1000-
bp PCR product was observed in 76 (60.8%) isolates
whereas the 900-, 800-, and 700-bp products were found
in 21 (16.8%), 16 (12.8%), and 12 (9.6%), respectively.
Among the 27 S. aureus strains from one herd, 12 were
tested by coa-PCR; in 10 strains, 1000-bp (83.3%), in 1
strain, 700-bp, and in 1 strain, 800-bp products were
identiﬁed.

Only 20 S. aureus strains with 1000-bp PCR products
were digested by AluI restriction enzyme. Two different
patterns of fragments were detected after AluI digestion,

14 strains yielded the pattern of approximately 500, 320,
and 180 bp, and in 6 strains the pattern was approxi-
mately 400, 260, and 80 bp.

DISCUSSION

β-Lactam antibiotics are among the most widely used
antimicrobial agents for the treatment of bovine masti-
tis. Many studies from different countries have showed
that among S. aureus strains isolated from bovine masti-
tis cases, the highest resistance was observed against
penicillin, a β-lactam antibiotic, and resistance to other
antimicrobials was usually low (Aarestrup et al., 1995b;
Erskine et al., 2002, 2004; Vintov et al., 2003; Sabour
et al., 2004). In accordance with previous studies, resis-
tance frequency in the present study was highest (63.3%)
against the β-lactam antibiotics, penicillin and ampicil-
lin. However, the frequency of penicillin resistance var-
ies among countries. This may be linked to many factors,
such as the differences in animal production systems
and national policies for the use of antimicrobial drugs
in each country. Vintov et al. (2003) found penicillin
resistance with an average of 32.4% among S. aureus
isolates from bovine mastitis in 9 European countries
and the United States. Penicillin resistance was high
among the isolates from Ireland (71.4%), the United
Kingdom (67.3%), and the United States (50%), whereas
it was low among the isolates from the Scandinavian
countries, with 2% in Norway. In an earlier study using
the same isolates, De Oliveira et al. (2000) determined
that the percentage of β-lactamase-producing strains is
correlated with the percentage of penicillin resistance
in these countries. In addition, they reported that the
level of resistance for penicillin was low regardless of
country, the MIC90 for penicillin were within 0.25 to 0.5
μg/mL and ≤0.06 μg/mL in Norway (De Oliveira et al.,
2000). In this study, following the β-lactam resistance,
the second highest resistance occurred against oxytetra-
cycline (27.9%) among S. aureus strains. Similar results
were found by other studies (Vecht et al., 1989; Leslie
et al., 2003).

The ﬁndings of this study show that penicillin resis-
tance is relatively higher in Turkey than that is in other
countries (Aarestrup et al., 1995b; Gentilini et al., 2000;
Calvinho et al., 2002; Gianneechini et al., 2002; Yoshi-
mura et al., 2002; Pengov and Ceru, 2003). Studies car-
ried out on bovine mastitis in different geographical re-
gions of Turkey have also showed high frequency of peni-
cillin resistance (Akan et al., 2001; Hadimli et al., 2001;
Tu¨ ru¨ tog˘lu et al., 2002).

Some studies showed that frequency of penicillin resis-
tance has increased over time. In a survey carried out
in Finland (Myllys et al., 1998), it was reported that the
proportion of S. aureus isolates resistant to at least one

Journal of Dairy Science Vol. 88, No. 9, 2005

antibacterial agent increased from 36.9 to 63.6% from
1988 to 1995, and most of the increase in antibacterial
resistance was due to β-lactamase producing strains; in
the 2000 survey (Pitkala et al., 2004), penicillin resis-
tance for S. aureus was reported as 52.1%. Similarly, in
a Belgian study (Devriese et al., 1997), percentages of
S. aureus strains producing penicillinase were reported
that rapidly increased from 38% in 1971 to 70-80%
throughout the next 2 decades and in 1996 the percent-
age of resistant strains was reported as 51%. Some re-
cent studies indicate a trend of decreasing resistance
to penicillin in S. aureus isolates (Erskine et al., 2002;
Macovec and Ruegg, 2003). It seems that after a rapid
trend of increase, the percentage of resistant strains has
not changed over time or slight decreases are observed.
Likewise, the ﬁndings of this study represent that peni-
cillin resistance increased from 43.5% in 1995 to 70.8%
in 1999, and no noticeable changes were observed during
the following years. Unfortunately, there were not any
isolates from the years of 1996-98.

Resistance to β-lactam antibiotics is most often caused
by the production of β-lactamases (Fluit et al., 2001).
Watts and Salmon (1997) tested S. aureus isolates from
bovine mastitis cases and determined that penicillin and
ampicillin were the antimicrobial agents most affected
by β-lactamase activity. In this study, β-lactamase pro-
duction and β-lactam resistance was correlated in the
majority of the strains. Only 16 of the β-lactam-resistant
strains were found to be negative in the β-lactamase
test. It should be noted that in this study, the induction
of enzyme by testing the growth from the zone margin
of oxacillin or penicillin disc was not carried out and this
may have some effect on the results. All S. aureus strains
were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate, a β-lacta-
mase inhibitor combination, in this study. Thus, the re-
sults indicate that the majority of antimicrobial resis-
tance in S. aureus isolates is due to production of β-
lactamases. De Oliveira et al. (2000) also reported that
the speciﬁc β-lactam combinations of penicillin-clavula-
nate and penicillin-novobiocin were very active against
S. aureus strains. All of the S. aureus strains tested in
this study were found susceptible to oxacillin. Results
of the others studies also indicate that methicillin resis-
tance, which is important for human isolates, is not a
problem in bovine isolates (De Oliveira et al., 2000; Gen-
tilini et al., 2000; Calvinho et al., 2002; Erskine et al.,
2004).

Overuse and misuse of antibacterial agents have been
incriminated as the major selective forces encouraging
the development of resistance in bacteria (WHO, 2002).
The high rate of resistance against β-lactam antibiotics
and oxytetracycline may be the consequences of the com-
mon and uncontrolled use of these groups of antimicrobi-
als in Turkey. Evidently, these are the most widely used

STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS FROM BOVINE MASTITIS

antimicrobial agents for treating mastitis or other dis-
eases. It should also be considered that milk samples
are usually submitted to our laboratory when a prior
antimicrobial administration is unsuccessful. This may
have an additional effect on the results of this study.

It seems that antimicrobial resistance proﬁle may not
be homogeneous in a herd. Among the 27 S. aureus
isolates belonging to one herd, different antimicrobial
resistance patterns were observed. Therefore, one or sev-
eral isolates from a herd may not represent the resis-
tance patterns of the isolates from other animals in a
given herd.

In this study, 125 S. aureus strains were subtyped by
coa gene PCR. Studies (Annemu¨ ller et al., 1999; Lange
et al., 1999; Raimundo et al., 1999; Schlegelova et al.,
2003) carried out in different countries, using the same
primer pairs of COA2 and COA3, showed that several
coagulase gene types are responsible for the majority of
bovine mastitis cases and that some of these coa gene
PCR types are predominant in each location. In the pres-
ent study, a 1000-bp PCR product was the predominant
type, accounting for 60.8% of the isolates typed, whereas
only 16.8, 12.8, and 9.6% of the isolates yielded 900-,
800-, and 700-bp products, respectively. Similarly, Rai-
mundo et al. (1999) typed 151 S. aureus from 7 farms
in Australia and distinguished 6 PCR types with 73.3
and 15.2% of isolates assigned to 1000- and 700- to 750-
bp products, respectively. Annemu¨ ller et al. (1999) also
tested 25 isolates from 6 farms and obtained 4 PCR
products of 990, 900, 800, and 740 bp, with 990 bp being
the predominant product. Lange et al. (1999) tested 66
S. aureus isolates from different herds and distinguished
7 PCR products that ranged from 580 to 1060 bp. Nagase
et al. (2002) typed 53 bovine S. aureus strains from differ-
ent regions in Japan and differentiated 6 coagulase types
with the most predominant genotype accounting for
77.4% of the total strains. Schlegelova et al. (2003) identi-
ﬁed 3 coagulase genotypes among the 24 milk isolates
in a farm, and one genotype (730 bp) was predominant
in 83.3% of the isolates. Su et al. (1999) reported that
predominant types of S. aureus might be varied in differ-
ent geographical areas or herds, and that predominant
genotypes were more resistant to neutrophil bactericidal
activities than rare genotypes.

Other studies on the molecular epidemiological analy-
sis of bovine S. aureus isolates using different techniques
also suggested that one or a few types of S. aureus usu-
ally predominate in one herd or area ( Kapur et al., 1995;
Lipman et al., 1996; Fitzgerald et al., 1997, 2000; Myllys
et al., 1997; Zadoks et al., 2002; Sabour et al., 2004).

CONCLUSIONS

The results demonstrate that, as in many studies us-
ing either MIC values or disc diffusion results conducted

in different countries, S. aureus isolates are most com-
monly resistant
to penicillin. However, resistance
against penicillin was relatively high among the S.
aureus isolates from bovine mastitis cases tested in this
study. The second-highest resistance was observed
against oxytetracycline, and little or no resistance was
seen with the other antimicrobial agents tested. The
ﬁndings suggest the requirement of proper use of β-
lactam antibiotics for mastitis therapy. To prevent the
unnecessary use of β-lactams and to achieve effective
therapy, isolation of the microorganism and determina-
tion of antimicrobial susceptibility is essential. The PCR
method based on coagulase gene typing is capable of
classifying all S. aureus strains and is a relatively un-
complicated, convenient method for typing a large num-
ber of strains; however, discriminative capability of this
technique may not be adequate.
