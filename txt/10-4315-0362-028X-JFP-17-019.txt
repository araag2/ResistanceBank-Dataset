ABSTRACT

The current study was undertaken to evaluate Salmonella contamination in retail pork at major village markets of the Tai’an
region, China. In total, 200 retail pork samples were collected from four village markets between June 2015 and February 2016,
of which 69 samples (34.5%) were determined to be positive for Salmonella. Eleven serotypes were identiﬁed from the 69
Salmonella isolates, and Salmonella Derby was the most common (18 of 69, 26.1%), followed by Typhimurium (17 of 69,
24.6%) and Meleagridis (11 of 69, 15.9%). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that antimicrobial resistance against
tetracycline was the most prevalent (42 of 69, 60.9%), but antimicrobial resistance against both ceftriaxone and cefotaxime was
1.4% (1 of 69) and 2.9% (2 of 69), respectively. Multilocus sequence typing revealed that the 69 Salmonella isolates were divided
into 11 sequence types (STs), among which ST40 (18 of 69, 26.1%) was the most common, followed by ST34 (15 of 69, 21.7%)
and ST64 (13 of 69, 18.8%). Collectively, retail pork at village markets in the Tai’an region has a high Salmonella contamination
rate, and these isolates exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial resistance. However, the absence of a dominant ST demonstrates that
the Salmonella isolates from retail pork may be of diverse origins.

Salmonella is one of the most

important foodborne
pathogens that not only causes huge economic losses to
animal husbandry and food processing industries but also
threatens public health safety (7, 21, 24). Most of human
Salmonella infections worldwide are related to the con-
sumption of Salmonella-contaminated animal foods, such as
chicken, pork, beef, and eggs (24, 25, 33). In the People’s
Republic of China, 70 to 80% of bacteria-induced food
poisoning cases are related to Salmonella (28). As one of the
top pig-producing and pork-consuming nations (6, 19, 24),
the issue of Salmonella contamination of pork in China
should be examined with greater care because this will be of
great signiﬁcance for the control of foodborne salmonellosis.
increase in
antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella worldwide as a result
of the widespread use of antibiotics in treating animal
diseases and promoting animal growth (2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 18).
These antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella could not only be
transmitted to humans via the food chain but also make it
to treat Salmonella infections in
increasingly difﬁcult
clinical practice (14, 15, 23, 26). Therefore, understanding
the contamination status of Salmonella in animal-derived

foods and their antimicrobial resistance characteristics is of
utmost importance for effectively controlling the dissemi-
nation of Salmonella.

Numerous studies have been conducted on Salmonella
contamination in pork in China (6, 28, 29, 32). For example,
the Salmonella contamination rate of retail pork in Shaanxi
province, China, was 31% in 2007 to 2008 (31).
Furthermore, 12.8 to 15.8% of
retail pork samples in
Jiangsu province, China, were reported to be contaminated
with Salmonella in 2010 to 2012 (19). However,
these
studies were mainly carried out in urban areas, and there
have been very few reports on the prevalence of Salmonella
contamination of retail pork in village markets in China.
Therefore, in the current study we examined Salmonella
contamination and molecular epidemiological characteristics
in retail pork samples collected from village markets in rural
areas of the Tai’an region in China.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample collection. In total, 200 pork samples were collected
from four major
rural village retail markets in the region
surrounding Tai’an city—Daolang, Liangzhuang, Dajinkou, and
Fanzhen (50 samples per town)—between June 2015 and February
2016; they are situated 20 to 35 km west, south, north, and east of
the Tai’an region, respectively. These village markets are open air,
and no refrigerated equipment was in use.

a One Salmonella isolate was collected from each positive sample.

Two main pork types, chop and piece, were randomly
collected from various market stalls (two to three samples per stall)
and were rapidly transferred into sterile sample collection bags that
were subsequently stored in a freezer box. Samples were
transported to the laboratory within 6 h after collection for further
process.

Isolation and identiﬁcation of Salmonella. Approximately
25 g of each sample was placed into 225 mL of sterile buffered
peptone water in an Erlenmeyer ﬂask and grown for 6 h at 378C
with shaking at 100 rpm. After the preliminary enrichment, 10 and
1 mL of the enriched culture was transferred into 100 mL each of
the tetrathionate and Rappaport-Vassiliadis broth, respectively, and
incubated for 24 h at 428C with shaking at 100 rpm. The bacterial
cultures in tetrathionate and Rappaport-Vassiliadis media were
then plated on xylose lysine Tergitol 4 agar and xylose lysine
desoxycholate agar, respectively, and incubated at 378C for 24 to
48 h. Two to three colonies suspected to be Salmonella were plated
on MacConkey agar plates for puriﬁcation. Identiﬁcation of the
puriﬁed Salmonella-like colonies was performed using an API 20E
Inc., Marcy-l’ ´Etoile, France). Only one
test kit
Salmonella strain from each Salmonella-positive sample was
randomly selected for serotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility,
and multilocus sequence typing (MLST).

Serotyping. O and H antigens of Salmonella isolates were
characterized using the slide agglutination test with hyperimmune
sera (S&A Company, Bangkok, Thailand), and the serotypes were
determined based on the manufacturer’s instructions.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The Kirby-Bauer disk
diffusion method as described by the Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute was performed (9). A panel of 12 antibiotics
were used in this study: ampicillin (10 lg), cefotaxime (30 lg),
kanamycin (20 lg),
tetracycline (30 lg), gentamicin (10 lg),
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (1.25/23.75 lg), ciproﬂoxacin (5
lg), oﬂoxacin (5 lg), norﬂoxacin (5 lg), cefazolin (30 lg),
ceftriaxone (30 lg), and streptomycin (10 lg). Escherichia coli
ATCC 25922 was used as the quality control strain.

DNA extraction. Salmonella was grown overnight on Luria-
Bertani agar plates, and the colonies were collected using a sterile
cotton swab. The swab was washed in sterile normal saline to
prepare a bacterial suspension equivalent
to a 0.5 McFarland
standard. In total, 800 lL of bacterial suspension was then
transferred into a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube, boiled at 1008C for 10
min, and centrifuged at 12,000 3 g for 5 to 8 min. Then, the
supernatant was recovered.

MLST. MLST was performed according to protocols
published previously (22). The Salmonella isolates were then

grouped by eBURST 3.0 software (Imperial College London,
London) based on their allelic properties (11). The isolated strains
were considered to belong to the same group when ﬁve of the
seven alleles were shared between the strains.

Statistical analysis. The isolation rate of Salmonella from
pork samples collected from different markets was compared by
using a chi-square test (SPSS version 15.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL). P
, 0.05 was considered as statistically signiﬁcant.

RESULTS

Prevalence of Salmonella. In total, 69 Salmonella
isolates were retrieved from 200 pork samples, with an
isolation rate of 34.5% (69 of 200). A slight difference in the
isolation rates of Salmonella was observed in this study,
which may be due to differences in the sample types.
However,
there was no signiﬁcant difference in the
Salmonella isolation rates among the four village markets
(P . 0.05) (Table 1).

Distribution of Salmonella serovars. Eleven sero-
types were identiﬁed from the 69 Salmonella isolates, and
Salmonella Derby was the most common (18 of 69, 26.1%),
followed by Typhimurium (17 of 69, 24.6%) and Melea-
gridis (11 of 69, 15.9%). Except for these three dominant
serotypes that were shared in all four markets, the other eight
serotypes were not evenly distributed;
for example,
Salmonella Livingstone was in Liangzhuang only, Salmo-
nella London was in Fanzhen only, and Salmonella Rissen
was in Dajinkou only (Table 2).

markets were found (Table 3).

In terms of Salmonella serovars, isolates most frequent-
ly displaying resistance against one to three antibiotics were
Rissen (100.0%), Derby (50.0%), Anatum (50.0%), Agona
(42.9%), and Typhimurium (41.2%). Isolates exhibiting
resistance against

(100.0%), Virchow (100.0%), and Agona (57.1%). Only
the Typhimurium (29.4%) isolate showed resistance to more
than nine antibiotics. Of note, Salmonella Uganda, Living-
stone, and Goldcoast isolates displayed susceptibility to all
examined antibiotics (Table 4).

DISCUSSION

In the current study, 34.5% of

retail pork was
contaminated with Salmonella. This value was similar to
the contamination rate (31.0%)
reported in Shaanxi
province, China (31), but higher than the 14.1% reported
in Jiangsu province, China (19). Compared with other
the Salmonella contamination rate in China
countries,
obtained from this study was higher than the rates reported
in Denmark, Ireland, and the United States, which were
between 2.1 and 4.2% (3, 13, 17). In this study,
the
relatively high contamination rate of Salmonella may be due
to the fact that the retail pork at rural markets is generally
from small-scale pig slaughter houses where poor general
hygiene and unsuitable storage conditions are common.
During the cutting and handling processes of retail pork at
rural markets,
the absence of cover materials, storage
refrigerates, and disinfection treatments in the purchasing
areas can increase Salmonella-colonizing activity.

In addition, Salmonella contamination rate of retail
meats can be affected by sampling and isolation methods;
therefore, these factors should be taken into account when
comparing Salmonella contamination rates of meats in
different regions. The use of strict quarantine measures,
sanitary and cleaning methods, and reasonable slaughter and

transport processes have shown to be effective in reduction
of Salmonella contamination of meats in some countries (1).
In total, 11 Salmonella serovars were identiﬁed from the
69 Salmonella isolates, with Salmonella Derby being the
most common, followed by Typhimurium. These ﬁndings
are consistent with the ﬁndings in Yangzhou city and
Shaanxi province of China as well as those in North
Vietnam and the Republic of Ireland (6, 17, 27, 31). The
incidence of Salmonella Derby contamination has been
gradually increasing in recent years. For example, Derby is
frequently isolated from retail pork and slaughter pigs and
has already surpassed Typhimurium as the most frequently
isolated serovar from pigsties in Europe (10). In addition,
Salmonella Derby is commonly isolated from fecal samples
of symptomatic human cases in Europe (5) and has become
the third most common Salmonella causing human infec-
tions in China (20, 30). Other serotypes of Salmonella
repeatedly identiﬁed in this study were Salmonella Melea-
gridis and Agona, which was in agreement with the result
described in previous studies conducted in China (6, 19, 24,
31). Other serovars of Salmonella, such as Virchow, Rissen,
Anatum, and London, were also identiﬁed in this study, but
the number of isolates was relatively small and may be
related to regional differences and limitations in the
sampling methods.

Previous studies have demonstrated that antimicrobial
resistance genes on conjugative plasmids of Salmonella can
be readily transferred to other bacteria and therefore pose a

serious threat to public health safety (15, 23, 26). In this
study, antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that 43
Salmonella isolates (43 of 69, 62.3%) from retail pork were
resistant to at least one antibiotic. The resistance rate against
tetracycline was the most prevalent (42 of 69, 60.9%), which
may be associated with the fact that tetracycline has been
widely used in the pig industry of mainland China. Of note,
multidrug-resistant Salmonella were observed among the
retail pork isolates in this study, particularly Salmonella
Typhimurium. For example, ﬁve Salmonella Typhimurium
isolates (5 of 17, 29.4%) were resistant to more than nine
antibiotics. Fortunately, antimicrobial
resistances against
both ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were 1.4 and 2.9%,
respectively.

To illustrate genetic relatedness of Salmonella, a
population snapshot of the comparison of the ST results in
this study with published ST was made using eBURST 3.0.
The results showed that 11 STs were identiﬁed and ST40
was the most common Salmonella genotype in the current
study. ST40 is widely distributed in pigs and pork in Europe
and America, and it is often found in Asian and European
patients (6, 19). As the second and third most common
serotypes, ST34 and ST19 are also widely found in humans
and pigs in Japan, the United States, and Europe, indicating
that Salmonella may be transmitted from pigs to humans via
the food chain. In addition, among the 11 STs identiﬁed,
only ST19 and ST34 belong to one clone complex, and no
predominant ST was found in this study, suggesting that

SALMONELLA FROM RETAIL PORK IN VILLAGE MARKETS

1639

Salmonella in contaminated pork may be derived from
diverse sources.

It is an obvious limitation that only one Salmonella
isolate was obtained to analyze in this study, and this limited
the conclusions that can be drawn on distribution over the
different markets. But the study to some extent reﬂected the
prevalence and molecular epidemiology of Salmonella in
retail pork sold in village markets in the Tai’an region of
China. Collectively, Salmonella isolates in village markets
exhibited resistance to multiple antibiotics and antibiotics
resistance was strongly related with serotypes. In addition,
no predominant ST was found in this study, suggesting that
Salmonella in contaminated pork originated from diverse
sources.
