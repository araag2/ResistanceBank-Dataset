This study aims to demonstrate the antibiotic resistance and its association with disinfectant and heavy metal
resistance in 152 Salmonella isolates recovered from retail foods of animal origins. Susceptibility testing
demonstrated that 92.8% isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic, and the resistance was highest to
oxytetracycline (80.9%), followed by trimethoprim (64.5%), amoxicillin (28.9%), ampicillin (28.3%), levo-
ﬂoxacin (21.7%), ciproﬂoxacin (16.4%), and gentamicin (10.5%), respectively. The blaTEM and tetA genes
(44.7%) were commonly present. The qacF and qacED1 genes were detected in 18.4% and 8.6% of all isolates.
The Cu-resistance genes pcoR, pcoC, and pcoA were the most prevalent (20.4–40.8%), followed by Hg-
resistance gene merA (17.8%) and As-resistance genes arsB (6.6%). The antibiotic resistance was highly
associated with disinfectant or certain heavy metal resistance genes. Most notably, the association among Cu-
resistance genes ( pcoC, pcoR), disinfectant resistance genes (qacF, qacED1), and tetracycline and sulfonamide
resistance genes (tet, sul) was signiﬁcant ( p < 0.05). Pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis revealed that Salmonella
isolates was associated with supermarkets indicating the possibility of crosscontamination in farms or pro-
cessing environment. This study indicated that retail meats may be a reservoir for the dissemination of
antibiotic-resistant Salmonella and using disinfectants for decontamination or metals in livestock may provide a
pressure for coselecting strains with acquired resistance to other antimicrobials.

Introduction

S almonella is recognized as a common bacterial cause

of foodborne diarrheal illness worldwide.1–3 Every year,
*42,000 cases of salmonellosis are reported through the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United
States; these cases have resulted in high morbidity and eco-
nomic costs.4,5 In China, the increase in consumption of food
products of animal origin also increased potential exposure to
Salmonella.6,7 The genus Salmonella encompasses a large
taxonomic group with more than 2,600 different serotypes.8
Although all serotypes of Salmonella may be regarded as po-
tential human pathogens, the vast majority of infections are

caused by a limited number of serotypes, of which Salmonella
Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium are the two most
common serotypes associated with gastrointestinal disease
in humans.9,10

Approaches to prevent and control salmonellosis in
livestock have been dependent on the use of antibiotics for
many years. However, numerous antibiotic-resistant bacte-
ria have been reported in different countries.11–13 Most of
the antibiotic-resistant Salmonella are of zoonotic origin and
acquire their resistance in food animal hosts, which might
cause human infections through the food chain.14 Therefore,
antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria from animals can
be a serious threat to public health.15

Disinfectants are extensively used to control infection and/
or microbial contamination in food manufacturing facilities
and environments. Among the different disinfectants currently
available, quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), such as
benzalkonium chloride (BC) and cetylpyridinium chloride
(CTPC), are used extensively because these compounds are
nonirritating and noncorrosive with little toxicity and high
antimicrobial efﬁcacy over a wide pH range.16,17 The wide use
and misuse of QACs in food environments can impose a se-
lective pressure for bacteria and contribute to the emergence of
disinfectant-resistant microbes.18

Metal-containing

antimicrobial

compounds with

or
growth-promoting activity are also widely used as feed ad-
ditive in food animals.19,20 Copper sulfate and organic ar-
senicals (e.g., phenylarsonic acid) are agents for therapy and
growth, and mercury compounds have been usually used as
disinfectants in food animal-producing environment for a
number of years.20,21 Due to its stable and persistent features,
when heavy metals accumulate to critical concentrations, they
potentially trigger resistance to emerge within the food ani-
mal hosts. The heavy metal resistance genes (HMRGs) have
also been identiﬁed in different environments. The genes that
are responsible for resistance to arsenic (arsA), copper
(copB), and zinc (czrC) have been observed in methicillin-
resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated from livestock.20
Meanwhile, the genes czcA and arsB for cobalt and arsenic
resistance,
respectively, have been found in municipal
wastewater treatment plants and associated with antibiotic
resistance genes (ARGs).22 Furthermore, the HMRGs appear
to be predominantly plasmid mediated.21,23

Previously studies demonstrated that a relationship be-
tween the acquisition of HMRGs and ARGs, and antibiotic
resistance may arise through coresistance or crossresistance
to metals or coregulation of resistance pathways.20,24,25 The
disinfectant resistance genes, as well as HMRGs, are com-
monly located in mobile genetic elements (MGEs).23,26,27
The widespread use of disinfectants has raised concerns
over their possible involvement
in the development of
antimicrobial resistance, particularly coresistance to antibi-
otics.27,28 Therefore, under the pressure of concomitant use
of antibiotics, heavy metals, and disinfectants, the potential
coselection of resistance genes and the spread of acquired
resistance is enhanced.22,29 However, little information was
known about the occurrence of disinfectant and heavy metal
resistance in Salmonella isolated from retail foods of animal
origin. The current study investigated the prevalence of
antibiotic, disinfectant, and heavy metal resistance in Sal-
monella isolates, determined the associations between anti-
biotic resistance and the presence of disinfectant (QACs)
and/or HMRGs, and explored the genetic relatedness of
Salmonella from retail foods of animal origin.

Materials and Methods

Sampling

A total of 327 raw meat samples,

including pork
(n = 137), chicken (n = 91), and beef (n = 99) were purchased
from supermarkets in Sichuan Province between July 2013
and December 2014. The samples were aseptically collected
in sterilized plastic bags and kept cold during transport from
the supermarket to the laboratory.

Salmonella isolation and serotyping

The methods described by the United States Department of
Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service were used to
isolate Salmonella from retail foods of animal origin.30 Brieﬂy,
25 g portions of the products were used for culturing. Each
sample was placed in separate sterile Erlenmeyer ﬂasks with
225 ml buffered peptone water and incubated at 37°C in a water
bath with shaking at 120 rpm for 6 h. After pre-enrichment, 10
and 1 ml of pre-enriched rinses were transferred to 100 ml each
of the tetrathionate (TT; Beijing Land Bridge Technology Co.,
Ltd., Beijing, China) and Rappaport-Vassiliadis (RV; Beijing
Land Bridge Technology Co., Ltd.) broths, respectively, and
incubated at 42°C in a water bath with shaking at 160 rpm for
24 h. One loopful of overnight TT broth culture was streaked
onto xylose lysine tergitol agar plates (Beijing Land Bridge
Technology Co., Ltd.), whereas the RV broth was streaked
onto agar of xylose lysine deoxycholate (Beijing Land Bridge
Technology Co., Ltd.) and incubated at 37°C for 24 h.

Three presumptive Salmonella colonies from each plate
were inoculated onto triple sugar iron (Beijing Land Bridge
Technology Co., Ltd.) and urea agar slants (Beijing Land
Bridge Technology Co., Ltd.).30 After 24 h of incubation at
35°C,
isolates with typical Salmonella phenotypes were
conﬁrmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR
assays for identiﬁcation of Salmonella were described pre-
viously.30 A 284 bp PCR product targeting invA was ampli-
ﬁed using the primers invA 139 (5¢-GTGAAATTATCGCCA
CGTTCGGGCAA-3¢) and invA 141 (5¢-TCATCGCACCGT
CAAAGGAACC-3¢). Amplicons were sequenced by Shang-
hai Sangon Bioengineering Co., Ltd. Nucleotide sequences
were analyzed using BLAST software, which is available at
the National Center for Biotechnology Information web-site
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). If more than one isolate from each
sample was Salmonella positive, only one was randomly se-
lected and included in this study.31 Conﬁrmed isolates were
stored in Tryptone Soya Broth (Hangzhou Microbial Reagent
Co., Ltd.) containing 20% glycerol at -80°C until use. All
isolates were further serotyped using commercial antisera
purchased from Statens Serum Institute, Denmark, as de-
scribed by the manufacturer.

Antibiotic resistance in Salmonella

The tested antibiotics were as follows: amoxicillin (AMX),
amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC), ampicillin (AMP), ceftio-
fur (EFT), oxytetracycline (OTC), ciproﬂoxacin (CIP), levo-
ﬂoxacin (LEV), trimethoprim (TMP), and gentamicin (GEN),
all of which were purchased from Hangzhou Microbial Reagent
Co., Ltd. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were
determined by using the agar dilution method, and breakpoints
for antibiotic susceptible and/or resistant were determined as
recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards In-
stitute (CLSI).32 Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and E. coli
ATCC 35218 were used as the quality control strains. The re-
sistance genes were examined through PCR using speciﬁc oli-
gonucleotide primers as described previously.33–39 All results
were conﬁrmed by at least two independent experiments.

Disinfectant resistance in Salmonella

The disinfectants tested were BC (Chengdu Best-Reagent
Company, Chengdu, China; ‡98% purity) and CTPC ( J&K

Chemical; ‡98% purity). The MICs of disinfectants were
determined using the agar dilution method recommended by
the CLSI.24,32 The range of concentrations used to determine
the MICs of both disinfectants were 0.125 to 1,024 mg/L.
E. coli ATCC 10536 was used as the quality control strain.
The disinfectants’ resistance genes [sugE(p), qacED1, qacE,
qacF, and qacG] were ampliﬁed and sequenced as described
previously.27

Detection of HMRGs

The 17 different HMRGs encoding for 9 heavy metal
resistance were detected by PCR based on published
methods.19–21,23,29,40–46 The positive controls that carried
the resistance genes were conﬁrmed using PCR followed by
sequence analysis (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China).

Pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis

All the isolates were selected for pulsed-ﬁeld gel elec-
trophoresis (PFGE) analysis using the PulseNet protocol
(www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/PDF/ecoli-shigella-salmonella-pfge-
protocol-508c.pdf). The XbaI-digested DNA fragments were
analyzed using 1% agarose gels and a CHEF MAPPER
electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The elec-
trophoresis conditions were as previously described.47 Sal-
monella enterica serovar, Braenderup H9812, was used as a
marker. PFGE results were analyzed by BioNumerics soft-
ware, and banding patterns were compared using Dice co-
efﬁcients with a 1.5% band position tolerance.

Data analysis

Chi-squared test of independence or Fisher’s exact test
was performed to analyze data using SPSS v.12 (SPSS, Inc.,
1989–2003). A p-value less than 0.05 was considered sta-
tistically signiﬁcant for comparison.

Results

Prevalence and serotypes of Salmonella

Of the 327 retail meat samples, 46.5% (n = 152) were
contaminated with Salmonella. The most common prevalence
was observed in pork (n = 75, 54.7%), followed by chicken
(n = 43, 47.3%) and beef (n = 34, 34.3%), respectively.

Among the 152 Salmonella isolates, 21 Salmonella se-
rotypes were detected. Salmonella Derby was the most
prevalent (28.9%, n = 44), followed by Salmonella Typhi-
murium (15.8%, n = 24), Salmonella Rissen (15.8%, n = 24),
Salmonella Enteritidis (9.9%, n = 15), and Salmonella Lon-
don (5.9%, n = 9). The top ﬁve serotypes accounted for more
than 75% of the strains.

The distribution of serotypes varied by meat

types
(Table 1). In chicken, the predominant serotypes were Sal-
monella Enteritidis (34.9%, n = 15), Salmonella Derby
(18.6%, n = 8), and Salmonella Typhimurium (9.3%, n = 4).
including Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella
Six serotypes,
Agona, Salmonella Corvallis, Salmonella Hadar, Salmonella
Indiana, and Salmonella Kouka, were only isolated from
chicken. For pork samples, most isolates were contaminated
with Salmonella Derby (32.0%, n = 24), followed by Salmonella
Rissen (24.0%, n = 18), and Salmonella Typhimurium (14.7%,
n = 11). The Uganda and Waycross serotypes were only detected
in pork. In beef samples, the top three serotypes were Salmonella
Derby (35.3%, n = 12), Salmonella Typhimurium (26.5%, n = 9),
and Salmonella Rissen (8.8%, n = 3), whereas Salmonella Al-
bany and Salmonella Give were only detected in beef.

Phenotype and genotype of antibiotic
resistance in Salmonella

In general, 92.8% (n = 141) Salmonella isolates demon-
strated resistance to at least one antibiotic and 43.4% (n = 66)
were multidrug resistant (MDR, resistance to at least three
classes of antibiotics). As shown in Fig. 1, of all the resistant
isolates, 80.9% (n = 123) were resistant to OTC, followed by
TMP (64.5%, n = 98), AMX (28.9%, n = 44), AMP (28.3%,
n = 43), LEV (21.7%, n = 33), CIP (16.4%, n = 25), and GEN
(10.5%, n = 16). Moreover, 48 resistance proﬁles were ob-
served in the resistant isolates, and the top three frequent
resistance proﬁles were OTC (17.7%, n = 25), OTC–TMP
(17.7%, n = 25), and AMX–OTC–TMP (11.3%, n = 16). The
frequency of antibiotic resistance varied depending on meat
types (Fig. 1) and serotypes (Fig. 2). Notably, of the isolates
from pork, 97.3% (n = 73) showed resistance to antibiotics,
followed by 94.1% (n = 32) in beef, and 83.7% (n = 36) in
chicken. The prevalence of MDR Salmonella also was
highest in pork (49.3%, n = 37), followed by chicken (44.2%,
n = 19) and beef (n = 10, 29.4%). Besides, the prevalence of

Phenotype and genotype of disinfectant
resistance in Salmonella

Figure 4 showed the distribution of the MICs of disin-
fectants in Salmonella isolates from different retail meats.
Our results revealed that the MICs of CTPC were 8 to
256 mg/L and BC were 8 to 128 mg/L. Generally, most
Salmonella isolates exhibited MICs of 128 mg/L for CTPC
(79.4%, n = 102) and BC (58.6%, n = 89). The chicken iso-
lates (90.7%, n = 39) had higher MICs (128 mg/L) for BC
than those from the beef (79.4%, n = 27) and pork (48.0%,
n = 36) isolates ( p < 0.001). Meanwhile, 76.0% (n = 57) of
the isolates that originated from pork had higher MICs
(128 mg/L) for CTPC than the 53.5% (n = 23) from chicken
and the 20.6% (n = 9) from beef ( p < 0.001). The MIC50
values and MIC90 values were the same in the isolates from
different meat types (128 mg/L). In addition, the MIC ranges
varied in the top ﬁve serotypes.

The qacF and qacED1 gene was detected in 18.4% (n = 28)
and 8.6% (n = 13) of all the isolates, whereas the qacE, qacG,
and sugE(p) genes were not detected in any isolates (Fig. 3b).
The qacF was found the highest frequency in pork (24%,
n = 18) and Salmonella Rissen (26.1%, n = 6). The qacED1
gene was found the highest frequency in chicken (16.3%,
n = 7) and Salmonella Rissen (26.1%, n = 6).

Prevalence of HMRGs

Totally, 58.55% (n = 89) of the isolates carried at least one
HMRG. The Cu-resistance genes pcoR, pcoC, and pcoA
were the most common, accounting for 43.4% (n = 66),
40.8% (n = 62), and 20.4% (n = 31), respectively (Fig. 3c).
Besides, 17.8% (n = 27) and 6.6% (n = 10) of the isolates

resistance to OTC and TMP was observed signiﬁcantly
higher in pork isolates than in beef and chicken isolates
( p < 0.001), whereas a higher prevalence of resistance to
AMP was observed in the isolates from chicken than from
pork and beef isolates ( p < 0.001). Interestingly, all Salmo-
nella Typhimurium (n = 24) were resistant to at least one
antibiotic, and high frequency of antibiotic resistance to LEV
( p < 0.001) and CIP ( p < 0.05) was observed in Salmonella
London compared with the other serotypes.

As shown in Fig. 3a, the blaTEM (44.7%, n = 34) gene was
most
the
aminoglycoside-resistant isolates, the ant(3")-Ia gene was
detected in highest frequency (50%, n = 8). In tetracycline-
resistant isolates, tetA (44.7%, n = 55) was the most prevalent.
Notably, the prevalence of sul1, sul2, and sul3 were the same
(20.4%, n = 20) in trimethoprim-resistant isolates. Only the
qnrA gene was detected in 40% (n = 14) of quinolone-resistant
isolates. Moreover, 68 ARGs combinations were observed in
Salmonella, and the top three frequent resistance gene com-
binations were tetA (5.3%, n = 8), tetC (4.6%, n = 7), tetG
(3.3%, n = 5), and tetA-tetG (3.3%, n = 5).

The prevalence of ARGs also varied by meat types and
serotypes. The tetracycline-resistant genes, tetA, tetG, and
tetC, were the most common genes in pork (46.7%, n = 35),
beef (35.3%, n = 12), and chicken (37.3%, n = 16) isolates.
Among different meat types, the prevalence of trimethoprim
resistance genes and aminoglycoside resistance genes in
pork isolates was the highest. Among different serotypes,
Salmonella Rissen contained all ARGs genes tested and the
prevalence of tetA, sul1, sul3, blaCTX-M, and ant(3")-Ia
were the highest. However, most ARGs were absent in the
isolates of Salmonella Enteritidis.

carried the Hg-resistance gene merA, and As-resistance
gene arsB, respectively. A total of 14 gene combinations
were found in all isolates. The top three resistance gene
combinations were pcoC (n = 14), pcoR (n = 14), and pcoC-
pcoR (n = 14) (Supplementary Table S1; Supplementary
Data are available online at www.liebertpub.com/mdr).

The distribution of the gene combinations varied by meat
types and serotypes. The pork isolates possessed most types
of the gene combinations, in which pcoC (14.7%, n = 11)

and pcoC-pcoR (13.3%, n = 10) were the main genotypes.
The pcoR (11.6%, n = 5) and pcoC-pcoR (7.0%, n = 3) were
the top two gene combinations in chicken isolates. The pcoR
(14.7%, n = 5) and pcoR-pcoA-pcoC (14.7%, n = 5) were the
top two gene combinations in beef isolates. The pcoC and
pcoR were found in high prevalence in Salmonella Rissen
(75.0%, n = 18). The merA and arsB were found in a fre-
quency of 34.9% (n = 8) in Salmonella Typhimurium, and
pcoA was detected in 47.8% (n = 11) of Salmonella

Typhimurium. In Salmonella Rissen, only Cu-resistance
genes were found, and only one isolate of Salmonella En-
teritidis had the merA gene.

Association between disinfectant
and antibiotic resistance

Most notably,

the presence of disinfectant resistance
genes was signiﬁcantly associated with the trimethoprim
and the related resistance genes sul ( p < 0.05) (Supple-
mentary Table S2). Among the qacF- and qacED1-positive
isolates, 100% (n = 28) and 93.3% (n = 12) of the isolates
were resistant to at least one antibiotic, and 64.3% (n = 18)
and 46.2% (n = 6) of the isolates were MDR, respectively.
the qacF-positive isolates contained b-lactam resis-
All
tance genes and 85.7% (n = 24) had trimethoprim resistance
genes. Meanwhile, 84.6% (n = 11) and 61.5% (n = 8) of the
qacED1-positive isolates possessed b-lactam and sulfon-
amide resistance genes, respectively.

Association between HMRGs
and antibiotic resistance

In general, we found association between the presence of
HMRGs and antibiotic resistance or ARGs ( p < 0.05 or
<0.001) (Supplementary Table S2). The gene pcoA was
signiﬁcantly associated with antibiotic resistance and the
genes, including b-lactam and blaTEM, tetracycline and
tetA, tetB, tetC, and aminoglycosides and ant(3")-Ia. The
pcoC gene was signiﬁcantly associated with the resistance to
trimethoprim and sul3, and tetracycline and tetG. The pcoR
gene was associated with tetracycline resistance and the
genes tetA, tetC, and tetG. Moreover, the association among
merA and tetracycline resistance and the gene tetG was
signiﬁcant. No signiﬁcant association was observed between
the presence of arsB and antibiotic resistance.

More particularly, the association among tetracycline resis-
tance genes, disinfectant resistance genes, and Cu-resistance
genes pcoC or pcoR, and sulfonamide resistance genes, dis-
infectant resistance genes, and Cu-resistance genes, pcoC or
pcoR, was signiﬁcant ( p < 0.05).

PFGE typing

Up to 41 distinct PFGE clusters (using a cutoff value of 70%)
were identiﬁed among the 152 Salmonella isolates (Supple-
mentary Fig. S1). The dendrogram showed that isolates of the
same serotypes were clustered together, except for a few in-
dividual isolates. The most common cluster 21 was comprised
of 16 isolates of Salmonella Derby. Similar results were ob-
tained in cluster 9 (Salmonella Typhimurium) and cluster 6
(Salmonella Rissen). PFGE clusters were also associated with
supermarkets. In cluster 41, two Salmonella Anatum isolates
originated from the same supermarket (WH). Moreover, 75%
(n = 12) of the Salmonella Derby isolates (cluster 21) were
obtained from the same supermarket located in different areas
(including QJ, CJ, JJ, JJ1, and WJ). Similarly, cluster1, 12, 25,
and 37 were clearly associated with the sampling supermarkets
regardless of location. In addition, some PFGE clusters were
also associated with meat types. For example, PFGE clusters
10, 22, and 40 were comprised of isolates recovering from pork,
whereas clusters 1 and 28 were from chicken, and cluster 17
from beef. Thus, PFGE revealed that the Salmonella isolates

were associated with the meat types and sampling supermar-
kets, indicating the possibility of crosscontamination in farms
or processing environments. PFGE results also indicated that
the resistance genes were widely distributed in isolates with
different meat types and serotypes.

Discussion

Generally, Salmonella Derby, Salmonella Typhimurium,
and Salmonella Rissen were the most common serotypes in
our study, followed by Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmo-
nella London. Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Ty-
phimurium were of the most common serotypes associated
with human infections from food of animal origins and have
been found among human isolates in Italy,48 Spain,49 and
United States.50,51 Gantzhorn et al.52 reported that Salmo-
nella Derby and Salmonella Typhimurium were the most
prevalent serotypes in Danish pig slaughterhouses. Salmo-
nella Enteritidis and Salmonella London were the common
prevalent serotypes in retail meats as well.7,13 In our study,
Salmonella Enteritidis was only identiﬁed with high fre-
quency in chicken, which was also the most prevalent se-
rotype in chicken meat
in the Shandong and Shaanxi
province, China.7,53 Higher carriage of these Salmonella
serotypes by animals may contribute to the contamination of
retail meats in human food supply.

The increase of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella
from retail meats has become a common problem world-
wide.13,53–55 Antibiotic resistance was common among the
Salmonella isolates, particularly a high level of resistance to
tetracycline (80.9%) and trimethoprim (64.5%). Similarly,
the most frequent resistance proﬁle of Salmonella isolated
from pork and chicken meats in North Vietnam was tetra-
cycline (58.5%), followed by sulfonamides (58.1%).54 The
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has conﬁrmed that
Salmonella isolated from food animals showed highest re-
sistance to tetracycline and sulfonamides.56 The globaliza-
tion of trade in retail meats could allow resistant Salmonella
spread to different countries, which might increase the risk
of the emergence and accumulation of antibiotic resistance
worldwide. The Salmonella isolates from pork in our study
showed higher resistance to antibiotics than from beef and
chicken. All Salmonella Typhimurium isolates were resis-
tant to at least one antibiotic. The results showed that the
frequency of antibiotic resistance may be related with meat
types and serotypes.54,55

The blaTEM, ant(3")-Ia, and tetA genes were the most
common in b-lactam-, aminoglycoside-, and tetracycline-
resistant genes in our isolates, respectively. A similar result
was reported by Yahiaoui et al.,57 in which blaTEM was the
most frequent b-lactam-resistant gene in E. coli. Moreover,
a high prevalence of tetA (55.6%),
tetB (91.7%), and
ant(3")-Ia (67.5%) genes were observed in the S. enterica
isolated from chicken and quail carcasses.58 The distribution
of ARGs varied by meat types. The genes tetA, tetG, and
tetC, were the most common genes in pork, beef, and
chicken isolates, respectively. There was a higher preva-
lence of trimethoprim- and gentamicin-resistant genes found
in pork isolates than in chicken and beef isolates. Bacci
et al.58 also observed that a higher percentage of the ant(3")-
Ia gene in Salmonella spp. isolated from quail and chicken
carcasses than in those isolated from chicken meat, and the

tetA and tetB genes were more frequent in chicken meat and
carcasses isolates, respectively.

The majority of the Salmonella isolates showed MICs of
128 mg/L for CTPC (79.4%) and BC (58.6%). Our previous
study demonstrated that 67.5% and 52.6% of the E. coli iso-
lated from retail meats exhibited MICs of 4 to 128 and 32 mg/
L for CTPC and BC, respectively.59 In China, the disinfection
requirements for a slaughterhouse (SB/T-10660-2012) stip-
ulated the dosage of QACs in the range of 0.015% to 0.1% for
slaughterhouses and meat production facilities. However, a
previous study reported the increasing use of QACs with high
concentration (10%), and susceptibilities to QACs have ap-
parently increased among the bacteria isolated from retail
meats or their production environments.18,52,59 The disin-
fectant resistance genes qacF and qacED1 were detected in
18.4% and 8.6% of all the isolates, respectively. The qacF and
qacED1 genes were less common in E. coli isolated from
retail meats.27,59 However, these two genes were located in
MEGs and linked (coexisted) with different ARGs showing
coresistance.27 The widespread use of disinfectant may pro-
vide a selective environment for different degrees of adaptive
resistance to Salmonella.

To best of our knowledge, limited research focused on the
prevalence of varied HMRGs in Salmonella isolated from
retail meats. The copper (228 mg/kg) and zinc (297 mg/kg)
concentrations in feed of livestock and poultry were ex-
cessive in Liaoning, China. Comparing with the maximum
limit value in Chinese standard (GB15199-94, GB13106-91),
the copper concentration in chicken was twice as the stan-
dards and the zinc concentration obviously exceeded the
limit.60 While in Jiangsu province, concentrations of zinc and
copper in animal feeds were 15.9–2041.8 and undetected–
392.1 mg/kg, respectively.61 Moreover, unlike antibiotics and
QACs that are biodegradable through microorganisms,62–64
heavy metals are not subject to degradation and can subse-
quently represent a long-term selection pressure, which po-
tentially contributes to the development and maintenance of
resistance genes.65 The Cu-resistance genes pcoR (43.42%),
pcoC (40.79%), and pcoA (20.39%) were relatively higher
than the Hg resistance gene merA (17.76%) and As resistance
genes arsB (6.58%). Argudı´n et al.20 found that among the
methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolated from livestock, 4.1%,
0.3%, 23.4%, and 62.7% were positive for the genes arsA
(As), cadD (Ca), copB (Cu), and czrC (Zn/Ca), respectively.
The difference of genes in frequency may be related to the
use of metal compounds as feed supplements at different
farms. In addition, HMRGs have been observed in other
environments. The genes of mer operon (merRTPABDE)
were detected in Aeromonas salmonicida isolates recovered
from juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture.66
Besides, Roosa et al.29 observed seven HMRGs (arsB, copA,
czcA, czcC, czcD, nccA, and pbrT) among the DNA of
sediments. The environment of origin (e.g., animal hus-
bandry, sediments, or slaughter house) of the bacterial com-
munity might be a factor that contributes to the spread of
HMRGs.22

In general, we found signiﬁcant associations among
HMRGs, disinfectant resistance genes, antibiotic resistance,
and related genes ( p < 0.05). The HMRGs and ARGs, as
well as the disinfectant resistant genes we tested, were
usually located on MGEs, such as plasmid pRJ1004, trans-
poson Tn4380, and Tn501.21,23,27,67,68 Besides, a higher

proportion of plasmids hosted by Salmonella tended to carry
the three classes of genes on the same plasmids.69 The
MGEs may potentially accrue different resistance genes
through coresistance 22,62 and could be efﬁciently spread
through bacteria community. We investigated the disinfec-
tant resistance genes that were signiﬁcantly associated with
the sulfonamide resistance genes ( p < 0.05). The class 1
integron contains the gene qacED1 and sul1 resistance,70
and coresistance may also occur involving the qacED1,
aadA2, and sul1 located in Tn5045.68

Besides, the association between the presence of HMRGs
and antibiotic resistance and related ARGs was signiﬁcant
( p < 0.05). Osman et al.71 isolated an aquatic bacterium
harboring a plasmid which contained genes conferring re-
sistance to antibiotics and metals Cr and Co. The IncA/C
plasmid isolated from Aeromonas salmonicida subsp., sal-
monicida carried mer and multiple ARGs.66 The association
among Cu-resistant genes ( pcoA and pcoR), disinfectant-
resistant genes, and tetracycline- and sulfonamide-resistant
genes was signiﬁcant ( p < 0.05). Both Hg-resistance genes
(merRTPCADE) and several antimicrobial-encoding genes
(sul1, qacED1, aadA1, and blaOXA-1) have been identiﬁed
on plasmid pUO-StVR2 in Salmonella Typhimurium and
these are linked with Transposon 21.72 Whole genome se-
quencing was performed in our study and will conﬁrm the
location of these genes in the near future.

Conclusions

In conclusion, this study demonstrated that antimicrobial
resistance was common among the Salmonella isolates from
retail food of animal origin. Antibiotic, disinfectant, and
heavy metal resistance varied by meat types and serotypes.
The antibiotic resistance was highly associated with disin-
fectant or HMRGs. The farms or processing environment
may be a major source for crosscontamination with Sal-
monella. Therefore, the retail meats may be a reservoir for
the dissemination of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella and
using disinfectants for decontamination or metals in live-
stock may provide a pressure for coselecting strains with
acquired resistance to other antimicrobials.
