Signiﬁcance and Impact of the Study: The buffaloes from different districts of West Bengal, India, are
important reservoir of multidrug-resistant Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC). India is home
to more than 56% of world buffalo population, traditionally raised by farmers. So, there is a major risk
of transmission of STEC among the human population of this part of the globe. However, there is no
prevalence study of STEC from healthy or diarrhoeic buffalo in India. The present study reports for the
ﬁrst time in India about isolation, molecular characterization and antibiotic resistance pattern of STEC
in healthy buffaloes.

Abstract

In total, 363 Escherichia coli were isolated from 165 faecal samples of healthy
buffaloes in West Bengal, India. Twenty-four of these isolates (661%) were
found to carry at least one gene characteristic for Shiga toxin–producing
(STEC). These STEC strains belonged to 13 different
Escherichia coli
O-serogroups. The stx1 gene was present in 23 (958%) of total STEC isolates,
whereas 20 (833%) STEC isolates carried the gene stx2. Twelve strains of
E. coli (50% of total STEC isolates) possessed enterohaemolysin (ehxA) gene in
combination with others. Fourteen (5833%) isolates found to possess saa
gene. However, no E. coli was detected harbouring gene for intimin protein
(eaeA). Of 23 stx1-positive isolates, seven (3043%) were positive for genes of
the stx1C subtype. Of the 20 isolates with the stx2 gene, 25% (5/20) possessed
stx2C and 10% (2/20) possessed stx2d gene. The phylogenetic analysis after
RAPD of STEC strains revealed six major clusters. The isolated STEC strains
were resistant most frequently to erythromycin (9583%), cephalothin (625%),
amikacin (5417%), kanamycin (4583%) and gentamicin (4167%) group of
antibiotics. No ESBL-producing (blaCTXM, blaTEM, blaSHV) or quinolone
resistance gene (qnrA) was detected in the STEC isolates.

Introduction

Escherichia coli are facultative anaerobic bacteria and nor-
mal habitat of
lower intestine in man and animals,
although some toxin producing strains can produce path-
ogenicity ranging from mild diarrhoea to fatal complica-
tions. One of such important toxigenic groups is Shiga

toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC). The clinical ill-
ness includes a spectrum of human sufferings like bloody
diarrhoea and even life-threatening conditions such as
haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) (Paton and Paton
1998a).
In addition to the enterohaemorrhagic E. coli
O157:H7 (EHEC, a subgroup of STEC), which received
world wide attention because of their association with

numerous outbreaks in human, several other serogroups
of STEC (O26, O91, O103, O104, O111, O113, O121,
O123 and O145) have also been isolated from severe out-
breaks of human disease in different countries (Hussein
2007; Espie et al. 2008; King et al. 2009). This scenario
becomes graver during infection with antibiotic-resistant
strains of STEC due to poor response or lack of response
to the applied treatment.

The ability of STEC to cause human disease is due to the
production of Shiga toxins, which inhibit protein synthesis
of the host cells leading to cell death (Karmali et al. 2010).
These toxins are subdivided into two major groups: Shiga
toxin 1 (stx1) and Shiga toxin 2 (stx2). Stx1 is a rather
homologous group in which three variants (stx1, stx1c and
stx1d) have been described (Brett et al. 2003). The stx2
group is more heterogeneous and is comprised of several
subtypes (stx2c, stx2d, stx2e, stx2f, stx2 g and activatable
stx2d) (Leung et al. 2003). Apart from Shiga toxin, STEC
strains may possess other virulence factor necessary for
infection such as intimin, encoded by the chromosomal
gene eaeA, which is found on a pathogenicity island termed
as the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) (Kaper et al.
2004). Additional virulence factors of STEC include entero-
haemolysin, a pore-forming cytolysin on eukaryotic cells
(Schmidt et al. 1995), bifunctional catalase peroxidase
(katP) (Brunder et al. 1996) and the etpD gene cluster,
encoding a type II secretion pathway (Schmidt et al. 1997).
Several proteins were proposed to be novel adhesion factors
of STEC like ToxB (a protein identiﬁed from the large, 93-
kb plasmid pO157 and required for full expression of
adherence of O157: H7 strain), and saa (STEC autoaggluti-
nating adhesin identiﬁed in the LEE-negative strains)
(Toma et al. 2004).

Treatment for STEC infection with antimicrobials is
controversial due to increased in vivo production of the
Shiga toxins with the applied antibiotics (Paton and
Paton 1998a). However, a few reports of antibiotic resis-
tance in STEC are available (Schroeder et al. 2002).
Extended-spectrum b-lactamases
(ESBL), produced by
E. coli, offered resistance against higher generations of
cephalosporins (except cephamycins and carbapenems)
and monobactam. Currently, ESBL-producing organisms
are becoming a major threat for patients in the hospital
and community. There are three major classes of ESBL
(TEM, SHV and CTX-M) encoded by blaTEM, blaSHV and
blaCTX-M genes, respectively (Geser et al. 2012).

Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli

infections are
food-borne zoonoses transmitted through the consumption
of contaminated food such as minced beef, raw milk and
unpasteurized dairy products, because the main reservoir
of STEC appears to be ruminants (Normanno 2007).
Domestic ruminants like cattle, sheep and goats have been
established as major natural reservoirs for STEC and play

a signiﬁcant role in the epidemiology of human infections
(Karmali et al. 2010). Buffaloes as STEC reservoir have
been detected in some European countries (Conedera et al.
2004; Galiero et al. 2005; Oliveira et al. 2007; Seker and
Yardimci 2008; Lorusso et al. 2009) as well as a few Asian
countries like Srilanka, Bangladesh and Vietnam (Moham-
mad et al. 1986; Islam et al. 2008; Vu-Khac and Cornick
2008). However, to the author’s best knowledge, there is
no such report from India, although India is home to
more than 56% of world buffalo population, traditionally
raised by farmers for milk and meat production or work-
ing in ﬁeld or farm. So a need of systemic study for the
prevalence of STEC, their genotype, phylogenetic relation-
ship, antibiotic resistance from Indian buffaloes was felt.

Results and discussion

Isolation of Escherichia coli from faecal samples of
buffaloes

(STEC)

Indian dairy sector including the buffaloes
is purely
domestic, not maintained in the intensive farm system as
in developed countries. So, there is a major risk of trans-
mission of the zoonotic pathogens like Shiga toxin–pro-
ducing Escherichia coli
the human
population of this part of the globe. However, there was
no systematic study regarding this aspect in healthy or di-
arrhoeic buffalo in India. Therefore, the present study was
conducted to determine the STEC occurrence, their viru-
lence gene proﬁle, phylogenetic relationship and antibiotic
resistance pattern in buffalo from seven districts (Bank-
ura, North 24 parganas, Murshidabad, Maldah, Hooghly,
Nadia & Burdwan) districts of West Bengal, India.

among

From the 165 faecal samples of apparently healthy buf-
faloes examined, a total of 363 isolates were identiﬁed as
E. coli on the basis of characteristic pink-coloured colonies
on MacConkey agar, metallic sheen in EMB agar, Gram-
negative small rod appearance in stained smear, and bio-
chemically they were catalase (+ve), oxidase ( ve), Indole-
Methyl Red-Voges Proskauer-Citrate (+ +    ) and ure-
ase ( ve), characteristic of standard E. coli strains.

Serogrouping of Escherichia coli isolates

Of the 363 strains of E. coli
isolated from buffalo, 77
(2121%) were untypeable, 21 (579%) were rough and
remaining 265 strains were typed into 52 different sero-
groups. O120 serogroup was isolated from largest number
of buffalo (117%),
followed by O25 (106%), O60
(906%) and O85 serogroup (717%). In contrast, Oliveira
et al. (2007) most frequently isolated O74 serogroup as
STEC from buffalo in Brazil. It has been found that eight
serogroups namely O22, O25, O41, O60, O76, O85, O112

STEC from buffalo in India

and O120 constituted 55% of the E. coli isolates in this
study. We have also found that only the serogroups O25,
O60 and OUT were present in isolates from all the stud-
ied seven districts of West Bengal, India. No report of
E. coli isolation from buffalo in West Bengal or India was
available to compare the result.

Detection of STEC by PCR

Escherichia coli harbouring any gene for Shiga toxins (stx1
or stx2) was detected in 24 (661%) of the 363 E. coli iso-
lates. Similar occurrence rate of STEC (54%) was also
found in water buffalo calves reared in Italy (Galiero et al.
1997), although Mohammad et al. (1985), Oliveira et al.
(2007), Islam et al. (2008) and Vu-Khac and Cornick
(2008) found higher prevalence rate of STEC in buffalo
(28, 0–643, 379 and 27%, respectively) in other countries.
These STEC strains belonged to 13 different serogroups
(O2, O5, O20, O22, O25, O41, O44, O60, O76, O85, O87,
O113 and O120) and two were untypeable (OUT)
(Table 1). STEC has been identiﬁed from ﬁve of seven dis-
tricts studied except in North 24-parganas and Burdwan in
West Bengal, India. Similarly, Mohammad et al. (1986)
also found O5, O20 and O76 serogroup as STEC from diar-
rhoeic cattle and buffalo calves, and O41, O76 and untype-
able serogroups were also observed as STEC isolated from

buffalo in Bangladesh (Islam et al. 2008). In addition, O22,
O113 and untypeables harbouring the genes for STEC were
isolated from healthy buffaloes in Brazil (Oliveira et al.
2007). Certain serogroups recovered in the present study
like O2, O85, O113 were earlier recorded to be associated
with human infection and therefore constitute a signiﬁcant
risk of public health hazard (Constantiniu 2002).

Subtyping of stx genes by PCR
The stx1 gene was present in 23 (958%) of total STEC
isolates, whereas 20 (833%) STEC isolates carried the
gene stx2. The present ﬁnding is in agreement with the
previous study by Islam et al. (2008) where stx1 gene was
found in a larger number than stx2 of non-O157 STEC
isolates from buffalo in Bangladesh, geographically nearer
to West Bengal state of India in comparison with other
studied countries, whereas in other countries, Galiero
et al. (2005), Oliveira et al. (2007) and Vu-Khac and Cor-
nick (2008) found a larger number of stx2-positive isolates
from buffalo than stx1.
the stx1 gene showed that 3043% (7/23) of these isolates
were positive for genes of the stx1C subtype. In contrast,
Vu-Khac and Cornick (2008) found a larger number of
stx1C possessing STEC isolates (6563%; 42/64) from buf-

falo in central Vietnam. In our study, most of the stx1C-
positive isolates possessed ehxA, saa or both genes. In
contrast, Oliveira et al. (2007) found all the stx1C-positive
strains were devoid of additional virulence factors. As
reported in a previous study by Friedrich et al. (2003),
stx1c-encoding strains are less pathogenic for human.

Of the 20 isolates with the stx2 gene, 25% (5/20) were
positive for stx2C, and 10% (2/20) were positive for stx2d
gene. This result is supported by Vu-Khac and Cornick
(2008) who also found stx2C as dominant variant (36%)
than stx2d (14%) in buffalo.

No Escherichia coli harbouring gene for intimin protein,
that is, eaeA, (Enteropathogenic E. coli) was detected in the
present study. This is in agreement with other reports like
Vu-Khac and Cornick (2008), who could not isolate single
eaeA-positive E. coli strain from buffalo in Vietnam and
Oliveira et al. (2007) in Brazil, where all STEC isolates
from buffalo were devoid of eaeA gene. Islam et al. (2008)
also found that all non-O157 STEC isolates from buffalo
lacked eaeA gene. Intimin gene (eaeA) is a part of the large
pathogenicity island, known as Locus for enterocyte efface-
ment (LEE). Although this LEE appears to confer enhanced
virulence, the presence of it is not essential for pathogene-
sis, because a number of cases of severe STEC disease,
including HUS, as well as occasional outbreaks, have been
caused by the LEE-negative strains (Paton et al. 1999;
Lepsanovic et al. 2012). The presence of the LEE is associ-
ated with certain O serogroups like O26, O103, O111,
O145 and O157 (Sandhu et al. 1996); none of which has
been identiﬁed as STEC in the present study.

Twelve strains of E. coli (50% of total STEC isolates)
possessed enterohaemolysin (ehxA) gene in combination
with others. However, only one strain of E. coli belonged
to O2 serogroup was detected harbouring only entero-
haemolysin gene, that is, ehxA (Table 1). Higher occur-
rence of ehxA gene was observed by Oliveira et al. (2007)
and Vu-Khac and Cornick (2008) who found 789 and
81%, respectively, in the E. coli isolates from buffalo, but
Islam et al. (2008) detected only 61% ehxA in the non-
O157 STEC isolates in buffaloes.

Paton et al. (2001) ﬁrst described a novel plasmid-
encoded adhesin, known as saa (STEC autoagglutinating
adhesin) in eaeA-negative E. coli strain responsible for an
outbreak of HUS. The saa gene was present in 14 (5833%)
isolates from buffalo in this study, out of which 10
(7143%) were associated with the ehxA gene. This is in

contrast to the previous studies by Oliveira et al. (2007),
Vu-Khac and Cornick (2008) and Islam et al. (2008) where
saa gene was detected in 835, 78 and 81% Escherichia coli
isolates from buffaloes, respectively. However, obtaining
saa gene in eaeA-negative strains and association with ehxA
gene is in agreement with the ﬁndings of other worker (Jen-
kins et al. 2003).

RAPD analysis of STEC isolates

All 24 STEC strains were characterized by RAPD-PCR to
determine the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relation-
ship among the strains. All the strains were typeable with
primer 1247, and they produced ampliﬁed fragment ranging
from 291 to 1888 bp. The phylogenetic analysis of STEC
strains (analysed by Doc-itLs image analysis software, UVP,
Cambridge, UK) after RAPD reveals six major clusters
(A–F) (Fig 1). Even though the RAPD banding patterns
were not identical, the phylogenetic analysis found similarity
between many isolates of STEC from different districts of
West Bengal, India. Except for cluster F, the rest were com-
prised of STEC strains from different districts. The two iso-
lates in the cluster F belonged to same serogroup (O113).
This is a support to the observation by Kr€uger et al. (2006)
where he found many RAPD pattern among the non-O157
STEC isolates belonging to the same serotypes, although no
district-speciﬁc cluster was observed.

Screening for other genes like katp, etpD and toxB in
STEC isolates by PCR

In this study, it has been observed that none of the iso-
lates possessed toxB, katP and etpD genes, which are in
agreement with Islam et al. (2008).

All the STEC isolates were tested for resistance against 26
antimicrobial agents. Resistance was observed most fre-
quently to erythromycin (9583%), cephalothin (625%),
amikacin (5417%), kanamycin (4583%), gentamicin
(4167%) and less frequently to chloramphenicol (417%),
norﬂoxacin (417%), amoxicillin (417%) and co-trimoxaz-
ole (417%). No resistance was observed in case of ceftazi-
dine,
along with tazobactam.
Multidrug resistance was observed in nine (375%) STEC
isolates. For azithromycin, streptomycin and neomycin,
although none of the strains were sensitive to those antibi-
otics, 7083, 9583 and 75% strains showed intermediate
susceptibility. Multidrug resistance was observed in nine
STEC strains. Oliveira et al. (2007) found 178% resistance
to streptomycin and ampicillin among the STEC isolated
from water buffalo in Brazil. In India, Khan et al. (2002a)
observed resistance to one or more antibiotics in 492% of
the STEC strains from cattle, and some of the strains exhib-
ited multidrug resistance. Arya et al. (2008) also found
100% resistance against kanamycin and cephalexin fol-
lowed by cephaloridine, enroﬂoxacin, amikacin, ampicillin,
tetracycline, ceftiofur, ciproﬂoxacin, colistin and co-trimox-
azole in STEC isolated from diarrhoeic calves in Gujarat,
India. This kind of multidrug-resistant STEC strains poses
serious threat to human health by affecting treatment against
it. In addition, this resistant bacterial pool in the intestine of
buffalo may transfer the responsible gene to other related
pathogens and make them also multidrug resistant.

Detection of ESBL-producing and quinolone resistance
genes in STEC isolates

None of the STEC isolates possessed the genes for ESBL
production (blaCTXM, blaTEM, blaSHV) and quinolone
resistance (qnrA). Although food animals are one of the
important sources of ESBL-producing E. coli
in several
countries in Europe (Geser et al. 2012) and Asia (Hiroi
et al. 2012), there are very limited reports of STEC iso-
lates harbouring ESBL gene (Valat et al. 2012).

Materials and methods

Sampling

A total 165 faecal samples of buffaloes were collected
randomly from seven districts (Bankura, North 24 parg-
anas, Murshidabad, Maldah, Hooghly, Nadia & Burd-
wan) of West Bengal, India. The samples were collected
from apparently healthy buffalo of all age,
sex and
breed during the period of October 2009 to January
2010.

Faecal samples were collected into sterile vials directly
from rectum by sterile cotton swab stick (HiMedia,
Mumbai, India). All the samples collected were placed in
ice in a thermo ﬂask and were immediately brought to
the laboratory for further examination. In the laboratory,
the samples were kept in the nutrient broth (HiMedia)
and incubated at 37°C for overnight. It was transferred to
MacConkey’s agar (HiMedia) and again incubated at 37°
C for overnight. Next day 2–3 rose pink colonies were
randomly picked and transferred to EMB agar (HiMedia)
followed by an overnight incubation at 37°C. Colonies
were observed for metallic sheen, and single colony was
streaked to nutrient agar (HiMedia) slant for further bio-
chemical conﬁrmation. All
the pure cultures obtained
from nutrient agar slant were subjected to Gram’s stain-
ing and standard biochemical tests as described by Wani
et al. 2004.

Serogrouping

All the Escherichia coli isolates after conﬁrmation by bio-
chemical tests were sent for O-serogrouping to National
Salmonella & Escherichia Centre, Central Research Insti-
tute, Kasuli, HP, India.

Bacterial DNA extraction

For PCR-based detection of Shiga toxin genes from all
the E. coli isolates, DNA was extracted as per the previ-
ously described method of Wani et al. (2003) with some
modiﬁcations. Instead of 100 ll, the extraction was per-
formed in 60-ll sterile distilled water.

Detection of Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli
(STEC) by multiplex PCR (m-PCR)

All the E. coli isolates including controls were subjected
to m-PCR for detection of stx1, stx2, eae, ehxA and saa
genes considered for virulence factor of Shiga toxin–pro-
ducing E. coli (STEC) as described by Paton and Paton
(1998b, 2002). The ampliﬁed product was visualized by
gel documentation system (UVP) after electrophoresis in
2% (W/V) agarose gel containing ethidium bromide
(05 lg ml
 1) (SRL, India) (Sambrook and Russel 2001).

Subtyping of stx1 gene present in STEC isolates from
buffalo

All the stx1-positive STEC isolates including the controls
were subjected to PCR ampliﬁcation for the presence of
stx1c gene as described earlier (Zhang et al.2002).

A. Mahanti et al.

Subtyping of stx2 gene present in STEC isolates from
buffalo by Multiplex PCR

All the stx2-positive STEC isolates including the controls
were also subjected to m-PCR ampliﬁcation for the presence
of stx2c, stx2d, stx2e and stx2f genes as previously described
(Wang et al. 2002).

Molecular characterization of STEC strains by randomly
ampliﬁed polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR)

The molecular characterization of all the STEC isolates
was performed by RAPD-PCR using a single primer 1247
(Merck Biosciences) in Gene Amp PCR system 9700
(Applied Biosystems, USA) as per the protocol of Khan
et al.(2002a). The PCR products were then electrophore-
sed in 1% (W/V) agarose gel containing ethidium bro-
mide (05 lg ml

 1) (Sambrook and Russel 2001).

(30 + 10 lg), ampicillin + cloxacillin (10 lg), enroﬂoxacin
(10 lg), amoxicillin (25 lg), erythromycin (10 lg), doxy-
cycline hydrochloride (30 lg) and peﬂoxacin (5 lg) (Hi
Media).

Detection of ESBL-producing and quinolone resistance
genes in STEC isolates
All the Shiga toxin–producing E. coli
isolates including
controls were subjected to PCR for the detection of bla CTX-
M, blaTEM, blaSHV and qnrA genes using the primers and the
cycle conditions as described earlier (Weill et al. 2004a,b;
Castanheira et al. 2007). The primers were procured from
M/s Genetix Biotechnology Asia Private Limited. The
ampliﬁed product was visualized by gel documentation sys-
tem (UVP) after electrophoresis in 2% (W/V) agarose gel
containing ethidium bromide (05 lg ml
 1) (SRL) (Sam-
brook and Russel 2001).

Detection of phylogenetic relationship among STEC
isolates

Acknowledgements

All the images taken by the gel documentation system
(UVP) were analysed using the Doc-itLs image analysis
software supplied with the system (UVP) as per manufac-
turer’s instruction. By comparing the difference in the
RAPD-PCR banding pattern, phylogenetic relationship
between the isolates was established. An unrooted phylo-
genetic tree was made using neighbour-joining method,
available in the software.
