2   19 Six imported pigs originating from Guangdong, Henan, and Hunan provinces in China during October 20 2015-February 2017 were culture positive for meropenem-resistant Escherichia coli. The samples 21 yielded 9 E. coli isolates of diverse sequence types carrying blaNDM-5 on IncX3 (8 isolates from 5 22 farms) or IncFII (1 isolate from 1 farm) plasmids. The mcr-1 gene was co-harboured by four isolates. 23 The IncX3 plasmids (~46 kb) carrying blaNDM-5 were identical or nearly identical to each other.  24 (74 words) 25   26 l

3  The presence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in livestock animals is 27 concerning as this may facilitate expansion of the gene pool from which pathogenic bacteria 28 can pick up the resistance genes and consumers may be subsequently exposed through the 29 food chain (1,2). For this reason, there is a need to enhance the monitoring of carbapenem 30 resistance in the food supply (1). In Hong Kong, 80% of the food animals are imported from 31 mainland China and involved farm suppliers from multiple provinces in the country (3).  32 From September 2008 to February 2017, rectal swabs were obtained from randomly 33 selected fresh pig carcasses at a centralized slaughterhouse in Hong Kong by trained 34 veterinary staff, as part of an ongoing surveillance (3). Each swab was collected from a single 35 animal and was inoculated into nutrient broth with 10 mg/L vancomycin and 0.5 mg/L 36 meropenem (4), followed by subculture on MacConkey agar plate supplemented with 2 mg/L 37 meropenem. Five to ten colonies from each selective plate were picked. MALDI-TOF MS 38 was used for bacterial identification. The agar dilution (for colistin) and disc diffusion (for 39 other antibiotics) methods were used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility (5,6). Isolates 40 from the same animal were considered to be unique if the resistance profiles for meropenem 41 and colistin were different. 42 In total, 856 pigs were cultured over 263 sampling dates (Table S1). Six pigs 43 originating from six different farms were culture positive for meropenem-resistant E. coli 44 (Table 1). According to the susceptibility patterns, a total of nine isolates were considered to 45 be unique and investigated further. All isolates exhibited positive CarbaNP test result and 46 were resistant to ertapenem, imipenem and meropenem. The presence of carbapenemase 47 genes and mcr-1 were investigated by PCR and sequencing (7-9). The blaNDM-5 gene was 48 identified in all nine isolates, of which four were colistin-resistant and co-harbored mcr-1. 49 The isolates were further investigated by MLST and replicon typing (7,9,10). Plasmids 50 carrying blaNDM-5 were of X3 (n=8, size ~45 kb) or F36 (n=1, size ~100 kb). Of the four mcr-51 l

4  1 gene identified, three were harbored on plasmids of different replicon types (X4, FIB and 52 Y). In conjugation experiments (9,10), there was no co-transfer of carbapenem and colistin 53 co-resistance but the plasmids carrying blaNDM or mcr-1 could be separately transferred at 54 frequencies of 10-4 to 10-5 and 10-1 to 10-6 transconjugants per donor cell, respectively. 55 Six isolates (one from each animal, Table 1) were sequenced by an Illumina MiSeq 56 platform at >150-fold coverage. The plasmids were assembled de novo using a CLC 57 Genomics Workbench (Qiagen, Redwood City, United States) and gaps were closed by 58 additional PCRs and Sanger sequencing (7,9,10). ISfinder (https://www-59 is.biotoul.fr/about.php) was used to identify and annotate insertion sequences. In strain P748, 60 blaNDM-5 was found in a contig (size ~32 kb) with 100% coverage and 98% identity to 61 p28078-NDM (accession no. MF156713). 62 Complete sequences of the five IncX3 plasmids with sizes of ~46 kb were obtained 63 (Table S2). They have a plasmid scaffold typical of IncX3 plasmids (Figure 1a). The genetic 64 load regions in the five plasmids were compared with two reference IncX3 plasmids (pNDM-65 HN380 and pIncX-SHV) (Figure 1b). In the blaNDM-carrying plasmids, an ISL3 with 8-bp 66 flanking direct repeats (ATATGCAT) was found downstream of the resolvase gene. The 67 umuD gene was split into two fragments (umuD1 and umuD2) at the same position as in 68 pIncX-SHV, resulting in a pair of 3-bp direct repeats (TGT). In pNDM-HN380, blaNDM was 69 inserted as an IS26-ISAba125 transposon-like structure (Figure 1b). Subsequently, the 70 upstream ISAba125 was disrupted by IS5 (10). In four plasmids with link to Guangdong and 71 Henan provinces, the sequences inserted between the two umuD fragments were 100% 72 identical (10117 bp in length). This inserted sequence differs from that in pNDM-HN380 by 73 a deletion of 7874 bp (Figure 1b). The remaining plasmid with link to Henan has an 74 additional deletion (616 bp) at the junction between the IS5 and ISAba125∆1 remnant. In the 75 five NDM-5 plasmids, IS5 was inserted at the same position leading to the flanking 4-bp 76 l

5  direct repeats (CTAA). In pNDM-HN380, IS5 was inserted at a different position in the 77 opposite orientation. 78 To explore the geographical distribution of potentially related blaNDM-carrying IncX3 79 plasmids, the complete sequence of pP768-NDM5 (chosen as a representative) was used to 80 query the GenBank. Twenty-two plasmids related to pP768-NDM-5 were identified by a 81 query of the GenBank (Figure 1c). These include 14 plasmids from China, four from 82 Myanmar and one each from Canada, India, Kuwait and Oman (Table S3). The plasmids do 83 not carry resistance genes other than blaNDM. Multiple NDM variants were carried by the 84 plasmids. These include NDM-1 and variants that differed by one to three amino acids, 85 including NDM-4 (M154L), NDM-5 (V88L, M154L), NDM-7 (D130N, M154L) and NDM-86 17 (V88L, M154L, E170K).    87   We identified the occurrence of similar IncX3 plasmids carrying blaNDM-5 in pigs 88 originating from multiple farms across three different Chinese provinces. The involvement of 89 IncX3 plasmids (represented by pNDM-HN380) in the dissemination of NDM in multiple 90 geographic areas in China was initially reported by our group in 2012 (7). Subsequently, 91 sporadic reports of pNDM-HN380-like plasmids carrying different NDM variants have also 92 been reported in India, Arabian Pennisula, Europe and Australia (11-14). Recently, a Chinese 93 national survey and several provincial studies revealed that IncX3 plasmids harbouring 94 different blaNDM variants were frequently found among clinical isolates of different 95 multilocus sequence types and species, suggesting that it is an important vector responsible 96 for the wide dissemination of NDM in China (15-17). IncX3 plasmids have a narrow host 97 range and have mainly been found in Enterobacteriaceae (18). Our finding from analysis of 98 complete plasmid sequences indicated that the five IncX3 plasmids originating from pigs are 99 related to pNDM-HN380 as well as plasmids originating from many other geographic areas, 100 thus confirming that this mobile NDM vector is widespread in the ecosystem.   101 l

6  As carbapenems have never been licensed for use in food animals in China, the 102 NDM-producing pig isolates detected in the present study may have been introduced to the 103 farms via human activity or contaminated feeds. It is worrisome that some of the NDM-104 producing isolates in the present study were found to co-harbour mcr-1 in another plasmid or 105 the chromosome. Nonethelesss, our isolates co-harbouring mcr-1 were recovered before the 106 ban of colistin in animal feeds was implemented in November 2016 in China.  107 In conclusion, this study identified an epidemic IncX3 plasmid carrying blaNDM-5 108 disseminated among E. coli originating from pigs with epidemiological links to 109 geographically segregated areas in China.  110 Accession number(s). The complete sequence of the five IncX3 plasmids have been 111 deposited into the GenBank database under accession numbers MF547511 (pP744-NDM5), 112 MF547510 (pP768-NDM5), MF547509 (pP785-NDM5), MF547507 (pP788A-NDM5), and 113 MF547508 (pP855-NDM5). 114  115 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 116 We thank the staff at the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) of 117 the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for assistance with specimen 118 collection.  119 This work was supported by grants from the Health and Medical Research Fund of the 120 Food and Health Bureau of the HKSAR, and the Consultancy Service for Enhancing 121 Laboratory Surveillance of Emerging Infectious Disease for the HKSAR Department of 122 Health.  123   124 l

11  Figure 1. Comparisons of IncX plasmids in this study. (a) Circular map of the plasmid 201 pP768-NDM5. This plasmid was used to illustrate the backbone shared by all the analyzed 202 plasmids and the location of the genetic load region. (b) Comparison of the genetic load 203 region in 5 plasmids harbouring blaNDM-5 with two reference plasmids (pIncX-SHV and 204 pNDM-HN380). (c) Alignment of pP768-NDM5 with 22 plasmids identified in the GenBank 205 (last accessed 27 Oct 2017). The circular maps were generated with the BLAST Ring 206 IMAGE Generator and each plasmid was colored by the geographical origin (China, blue; 207 Myanmar, yellow; Oman, orange; India, red; Canada, pink and Kuwait, purple) in the following 208 order (outer to inner circles): pP768-NDM5, pCREC-A6-NDM, pSCE516-2, pNDM5_IncX3, 209 pEc1929, pECNDM101, pAD-19R, pNDM5_WCHEC0215, pK518_NDM5, pK516_NDM5, 210 NUHL24835, pNDM-QD28, pNDM-QD29, pEC50-NDM7, pZHDC40,pJEG027, 211 pM216_X3, pM213_X3 and pM110_X3, pOM26-1, pNDM-MGR194 and pKpN01-NDM7, 212 pKW53T-NDM (full details of plasmids in Table S3).   213  214  215  216  217 l
