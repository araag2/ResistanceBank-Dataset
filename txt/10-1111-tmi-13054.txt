Abstract

objective Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria may be transmitted between farm workers and livestock.
This study aimed to determine and compare the prevalence and the genetic determinants of
cefotaxime-resistant and ESBL-producing Escherichia coli in faecal isolates from workers and pigs at
100 farms in northern Vietnam.
methods Farmers were interviewed about antimicrobial usage in livestock. Escherichia coli isolated
on MacConkey agar containing 2 mg/l of cefotaxime (CTX) were tested for susceptibility to different
cephalosporins by disc diffusion and screened for occurrence of ESBL-encoding genes by PCR.
results Antimicrobial usage was widespread and included classes regarded of critical or high
importance in human medicine. Dosages were 0.5–2 times higher than recommended, and
antimicrobials were often administered right until slaughter. Prevalence of CTX-resistant E. coli
was 86% in farm workers and 89% in pigs. In 76% of farms, CTX-resistant E. coli were shared
by pigs and farm workers. ESBL-producing E. coli were detected from pigs and workers at 66 and
69 farms, respectively. The ESBL phenotype was mainly mediated by CTX-M and to a lesser
extent by TEM. Occurrence of blaCTX-M was similar in E. coli from pigs (66.7%) and humans
(68.5%).
conclusion The high occurrence of ESBL-producing E. coli in pig farmers and pigs could present a
risk for spillover of these bacteria from pig farms into the community. Genomic studies are needed to
elucidate reservoirs and transmission routes of ESBL-producing E. coli at livestock farms.

Introduction

Third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins are antimi-
crobials commonly used to treat infections by Gram-
negative bacteria in humans and in selected geographi-
cal regions, also in livestock [1–3]. In Escherichia coli,
resistance to third- and fourth-generation cephalospor-
ins is generally mediated by extended-spectrum
b-lactamases (ESBLs), which are encoded by plasmids
easily transferable across bacterial species and reser-
voirs [4]. The possible exchange of ESBLs between
humans and pigs has been debated in many countries
for a long time [5, 6]. It has been suggested that antimi-
crobial-resistant bacteria may be transmitted from pigs
to people by direct contact, for example occupational
exposure of farm and slaughterhouse workers, con-
sumption of contaminated food and indirect transmis-
sion through the environment [7].

In Vietnam, the population of pigs is expected to

increase to 35 million in 2020 driven by fast-growing
domestic demands for livestock meat products and plans
to increase export [8]. Small-scale farms account for
about 90% of pig production and pork supply in Viet-
nam [9]. Pig diseases, mainly respiratory and diarrhoeal
diseases, are common and controlled by both prophylac-
tic and therapeutic antimicrobial use despite the fact that
most frequently occurring diseases, such as porcine repro-
ductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) and foot-and-
mouth disease, are of viral origin [10, 11].

Recent studies on antimicrobial use and resistance in
Vietnamese livestock production document much higher
amounts of antimicrobials used to produce pork than in
other parts of the world [10, 12]. ESBL-producing Enter-
obacteriaceae are now found in livestock, food and peo-
ple at similar or higher levels in Vietnam as in other
parts of the world [13–17], although little is known

S. T. T. Dang et al. Cephalosporin-resistant E. coli in Vietnam

about sources and routes of transmission of ESBL-
producing bacteria found in humans.

In this study, we aimed to determine and compare the

prevalence and the genetic determinants of cefotaxime-
resistant and ESBL-producing E. coli in farm workers
and pigs. To address this aim, we conducted a cross-
sectional study analysing pig and human faecal samples
from 100 small-scale pig farms located in Kien Xuong
district (Thai Binh province) and Soc Son district close to
Hanoi in northern Vietnam.

Method

Selection of pig farms and farmer interviews

One hundred small-scale pig farms, each farm raising
between 15 and 30 pigs, were visited in Kien Xuong and
Soc Son districts from May to July, 2015. Most (80%)
farms produced their own piglets and raised them until
slaughter (approximately 80 kg). Pigs sampled had a
weight between 20 and 50 kg. The two study sites are
located within a 100 km distance from the capital Hanoi
and are main suppliers of pork to the city population.
According to the 2015 annual report of the local Depart-
ment of Animal Health (DAH) in Vietnam, farmers in
Kien Xuong and Soc Son districts produced 200 000 and
121 580 pigs, respectively. Pig farms in the two districts
were similar in size, type of production and general man-
agement. District veterinarians employed by the DAH
provided a list of pig farms and representative farms were
selected in ﬁve communes in each of the two locations.
Most small-scale farms in Vietnam, including those
selected for this study, feed pigs a commercial diet mixed
with local traditional feed items, for example powder of
corn and cassava as well as rice bran. Vegetables, for
example morning glory, water hyacinth and banana tree
leaves, are also fed to the pigs. Antimicrobials were sold
to farmers in so-called veterinary chemical and drug
shops, by visiting veterinarians employed by pharmaceuti-
cal companies as well as local government and private
veterinarians.

A survey of antimicrobial usage at the selected farms
was conducted by questionnaire-based interviews of the
pig farm owners who all reportedly had daily contact
with pigs. The questionnaire covered the following sub-
ject areas: antimicrobial use practices, including type of
antimicrobial, dosage, duration of antimicrobial use;
withdrawal time before slaughter; main type of pig dis-
eases and therapeutic antimicrobials typically used; and
factors determining farmer’s choice of antimicrobials to
be purchased, including prize, experience and advice from
local veterinarians.

Collection of faecal samples from pigs and farm workers

Individual rectal swab samples were collected from ﬁve
randomly selected pigs in each pen at a farm using Fecal-
swab (COPAN, Brescia, Italia). Farms typically had
between three to ﬁve pens, and swabs were collected
from three pens. All swabs representing one farm were
placed into a sterile plastic bag (composite sample) con-
taining 50 ml of 0.1% peptone water with 0.85% NaCl
(BO0471; Oxoid, Cambridge, England). At each farm, a
human faecal sample of approximately 20 g was col-
lected by the farm owner during defecation using sterile
gloves. The sample was placed immediately into a
labelled sterile plastic bag provided by the survey team.
The farm owner was informed orally about the survey
and told that he/she could withdraw at any time. Both
pig and human faecal samples were stored in an insulated
box with cooling elements and transported to the labora-
tory where analysis was started on the day of collection.

Isolation of cefotaxime-resistant E. coli

One millilitre of composite faecal sample was mixed with
0.1% peptone diluents containing 0.85% NaCl (Oxoid)
in 1:9 ratio in a sterile plastic bag and homogenised in a
Bag Mixer model VW400 (Seward, England) for 30 s.
Serial 10-fold dilutions were prepared to obtain individ-
ual colonies after plating onto the surface of MacConkey
agar (Merck, Germany) plates supplemented with 2 mg/l
of cefotaxime (CTX; Oxoid, Hampshire, England) and
incubated at 37 °C for 24 h [18]. One gram of human
faecal sample was mixed with 9 ml peptone diluent.
Dilutions were prepared and cultured onto MacConkey
agar as described above to allow for the selection of indi-
vidual E. coli colonies.

Up to ﬁve presumptive E. coli colonies were selected
from each composite pig and human faecal sample. Iso-
lates were conﬁrmed as E. coli by biochemical testing
(API 20E, BioMerieux, France) with E. coli ATCC 25922
used as reference strain. Isolates were streaked onto
blood agar plates to ensure purity and stored at  80 °C
in Eppendorf tubes containing brain heart infusion broth
(CM1135, Oxoid) with 10% glycerol.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by disc
diffusion according to standard procedures [19]. All
selected isolates conﬁrmed as E. coli were tested for sus-
ceptibility to the following cephalosporins: ceftazidime
(CAZ, 3rd generation, 30 lg), cefpodoxime (CPD, 3rd,
10 lg), ceftriaxone (CRO, 3rd, 30 lg), cefuroxime

S. T. T. Dang et al. Cephalosporin-resistant E. coli in Vietnam

(CXM, 2nd, 30 lg), cefepime (FEP, 4th, 30 lg), cefopera-
zone (CFP, 3rd, 75 lg) and cefoxitin (FOX, 2nd, 30 lg)
(Oxoid, Cambridge, England). Antimicrobial susceptibil-
ity test results were interpreted according to CLSI criteria
[19]. Isolates classiﬁed as intermediate resistant were cate-
gorised as susceptible to avoid overestimation of resistance
(http://www.crl-ar.eu/203-reports.htm#eqas). Up to two
CTX-resistant E. coli isolates per faecal sample were ran-
domly selected to detect presumptive ESBL-producers by
the modiﬁed double-disc synergy test (amoxicillin/clavu-
lanic acid, 20/10 lg and cefpodoxime, 10 lg) [19, 20].

PCR for blaTEM-, blaCTX-M- and blaSHV genes

PCR was performed to detect common ESBL-encoding
genes, that is, blaTEM, blaSHV and blaCTX-M using previ-
ously reported primers and protocols [21, 22]. In each
PCR experiment, E. coli strains previously conﬁrmed to
carry blaTEM, blaSHV and blaCTX-M by PCR and sequenc-
ing (Institute of Biotechnology, Vietnam Academy of
Science and Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam) were used as
positive controls. Buffered phosphate solution was used
as a negative control.

Ethical approval

Ethical approval for the collection of human faecal speci-
mens was obtained from the Hanoi School of Public
Health, Ministry of Health before ﬁeld work was initi-
ated (Decision on ethical approval for research involving
human subject participation. No. 251/2015/YTCC-HD3).

Results and discussion

Antimicrobial use practices at the pig farms
70% of the pig farm owners interviewed (n = 100) had
graduated from primary school. In 65 farms, pigs were
fed commercial feed supplemented with traditional feed
items like corn- and cassava powder and rice bran mixed
with vegetables, for example morning glory, water hya-
cinth and banana tree leaves. Pig feed containing antimi-
crobials such as colistin sulphate, ampicillin or ampicolin
(a mix of ampicillin and colistin sulphate) was seen
stored at 12 farms (data not shown). Farmers stated that
the use of commercial feed (representing three different
brands) containing growth promoters was cost-effective
as it enabled the pigs to reach a weight of about 80 kg in
four months vs. 70 kg reached in 6–7 months without
use of growth promoters.

During our visits, we noted the antimicrobials and
their route of administration (Table 1) and gathered

information on antimicrobial use practices. 73% of farm-
ers often contacted veterinarians when their pigs were
diseased and asked for advice on which antimicrobials to
purchase. At 24 farms (24%), household owners went
directly to shops operated by veterinarians to buy antibi-
otics. The main reasons for treatment were diarrhoea and
respiratory diseases (details not collected). Despite advice
from the veterinarians, almost all farmers (94%) decided
on antimicrobial dosages based on their own experience.
Such dosages were typically from 0.5 to 2 times higher
than recommended on product labels and antimicrobial
treatment continued until slaughter with little adherence
to withdrawal periods. Six farmers did not provide infor-
mation about withdrawal periods. All interviewed farm-
ers (100%) stated that they tried to save money by
purchasing cheap antimicrobial products. Only 27 farm-
ers had attended free training courses on antimicrobial
use offered by both DAH and private medical companies.
Most farms had an allocated space where farmers dis-
carded empty bottles, containers and other items related
to used antimicrobials. Our ﬁndings of substantial
antimicrobial use in pig production are similar to those
of Nguyen et al. [10]. The use of higher antimicrobial
dosages than recommended may be due to poor quality
of the antimicrobials; a problem that has been docu-
mented for antimicrobials used in aquaculture in Vietnam
[23]. Antimicrobial treatment of pigs until slaughter
inevitably leads to accumulation of residues in pork prod-
ucts as documented by Hanh et al. (2015), who found
sulphadimidine residues in 50% and chloramphenicol
residues in 17% of pork samples sold at wet markets in
two Vietnamese provinces [24].

A recent study conducted from 2013 to 2014 estimated

that 563.6 mg of antimicrobials was used to produce
1 kg (live weight) of pigs in Tien Giang province, Viet-
nam [10]. The farms in that study were larger than our
farms, and therefore likely to have different antimicrobial
usage practices. Nevertheless, the amounts of antimicro-
bials used are very high, corresponding to more than
three times the global average annual consumption of
antimicrobials per kilogram of pig produced [25]. Similar
data were provided by Carrique-Mas et al. (2015) who
reported that a total of 470 mg of antimicrobial com-
pound were used to raise one chicken in Vietnam, vs.
80 mg in Europe [26]. Overall, these estimates of antimi-
crobial consumption in Vietnamese livestock indicate
inadequate knowledge on the adverse consequences of
inappropriate use of antimicrobials among farmers, vet-
erinarians and other stakeholders involved.

Most of the antimicrobials used at the examined farms

(Table 1) are considered of critical or high importance
for human medicine by WHO [27]. Adding colistin to

feed or water is worrisome as such selective pressure will
lead to resistance in pigs as documented by Nguyen et al.
(2016a) [10]. A recent farm-based study in Vietnam of
the colistin resistance gene mcr-1 in E. coli showed that
detection of mcr-1 in humans was associated with expo-
sure to mcr-1-positive chickens [28].

Occurrence of cefotaxime-resistant E. coli in pigs and
farmers

CTX-resistant E. coli were detected in 89 (89%) compos-
ite faecal samples from pigs and in 86 (86%) faecal sam-
ples from farm owners. As E. coli were isolated without
any selective enrichment step, it appears that CTX-resis-
tant E. coli were very highly prevalent at the sample,
host species and farm level. The very high prevalence of
pig farms positive for CTX-resistant E. coli is similar to
that reported in pig farms using 3rd-generation cephalos-
porins in Europe [29]. Although we could not retrieve
exact ﬁgures of cephalosporin and other antimicrobial
use, it was clear from the interviews that farmers were
administering antimicrobials without adequate knowledge
on dosages and treatment regimens (see the subsection
above).

The prevalence of ESBL-resistant E. coli in farm own-
ers is higher than previously reported in clinical settings
which is surprising as prevalence of cephalosporin-resis-
tant bacteria in clinical settings is expected to be higher
than in the general population [30]. Global trends of
increasing carriage of CTX-resistant E. coli in the com-
munity over time [31] can at least partially explain such
difference. A study from 2013–2014 in a Vietnamese

healthy rural population reported 88% of people being
positive for CTX-resistant E. coli in at least one of three
sampling times over a 12-month study period [13] which
is a percentage similar to what we observed and which
the authors proposed was due to improper use of antimi-
crobials among people [32]. However, in the same study,
when considering each sampling time separately, the
prevalence of healthy people carrying CTX-resistant
E. coli ﬂuctuated between 46% and 53% [13], which is
considerably lower than the prevalence detected in our
study.

As there are no speciﬁc reasons to believe that irra-

tional overuse of antimicrobials happens more frequently
among pig farmers than in the general population, it
appears that pig farming might have an impact on the
very high prevalence of CTX-resistant E. coli detected in
Vietnamese farmers. In Europe, higher prevalence of
CTX-resistant E. coli has been reported in workers at pig
farms with CTX-resistant E. coli-positive pigs than in
workers at farms with CTX-resistant E. coli-negative pigs
[29, 33]. It is, however, unknown if this is due to contin-
uous acquisition of resistant bacteria from animals or to
other livestock farming-related factors (e.g. handling of
antimicrobials and other compounds which may coselect
for antimicrobial resistance such as feed additives, disin-
fectants, etc.) promoting long-term colonisation of farm-
ers. The fact that CTX-resistant E. coli were
simultaneously detected both in pigs and in pig farmers
in 76% of the farms in our study strongly reinforces pre-
vious ﬁndings that contact with pigs has an inﬂuence on
carriage of CTX-resistant E. coli in farmers through
mechanisms yet to be elucidated. We also observed 13

farms (seven in Kien Xuong and six in Soc Son) in which
CTX-resistant E. coli were isolated only from pigs and
11 farms (eight in Kien Xuong and three in Soc Son) in
which CTX-resistant E. coli were isolated only from
humans. It is, however, unclear if this might be linked to
different biosecurity measures in the farms, to host-
related factors (e.g. resistance to colonisation by CTX-
resistant E. coli from a different host species) or simply
to presence of CTX-resistant E. coli at undetectable levels
in the samples testing negative.

Prevalence of resistance to additional cephalosporins in
cefotaxime-resistant E. coli

Up to ﬁve E. coli isolates from each sample were ran-
domly selected from CTX-containing MacConkey agar
plates yielding a total of 254 isolates from pigs and 263
isolates from humans tested for susceptibility to seven
additional cephalosporins.

Overall, CTX-resistant E. coli showed 15 patterns of

resistance to other cephalosporins (Table 2). Twelve pro-
ﬁles were observed in pig isolates and 11 in human iso-
lates (Table 2), thus indicating that the overall diversity of
E. coli clones and/or mechanisms of cephalosporin resis-
tance was slightly higher in pig than in human isolates.
This might have been inﬂuenced by the sampling strategy,
with pig samples representing pooled faecal samples from
different individuals and human samples deriving from
one individual only. In each of 89 farms, the isolates from
pigs showed at least two cephalosporin resistance proﬁles.
Similarly, two or more cephalosporin resistance proﬁles
were detected in isolates from humans at 86 farms (data
not shown). This suggests that different CTX-resistant
E. coli clones and/or mechanisms mediating cephalos-
porin resistance coexist both in the general pig and pig
farmers E. coli population and at the farm level.

Nearly all CTX-resistant E. coli isolates were resistant
to cefpodoxime (CPD) alone or in association with resis-
tance to other cephalosporins (Table 2) which was
expected, as this third-generation cephalosporin has a
very high sensitivity compared to that of cefotaxime for
detection of ESBLs [34]. Surprisingly, no isolate displayed
cefepime resistance, which is generally considered indica-
tive of CTX-M type ESBLs. However, recent European
Food Safety Authority (EFSA) guidelines do not recom-
mend use of cefepime for inferring determinants of
cephalosporin resistance from phenotypic data (http://
www.crl-ar.eu/data/images/ws_April-2016/f11_efsa_crite
ria.pdf). Coresistance to CXM, CRO, CPD and CFP,
CRO, CXM, CPD were the most common patterns of
resistance to different generation of cephalosporins
among isolates from both pigs and humans (Table 2) and

at farm level (Table 3). CXM, CRO, CPD resistance
occurred in 32% of isolates from pigs from 51 farms and
in 27% of human isolates from 41 farms. At 20 farms,
this proﬁle was detected both in pig and in human iso-
lates (Table 3). The CFP, CRO, CXM, CPD resistance
proﬁle occurred in 15% of isolates from pigs from 33
farms and in 25.9% of human isolates from 47 farms. In
22 farms, this proﬁle was detected both in pig and in
human isolates (Table 3). The predominance of a few
indistinguishable cephalosporin resistance proﬁles in iso-
lates from different host species and from unrelated farms
suggests the presence of related resistance determinants.
Additional patterns of resistance to different generations
of cephalosporins occurred less frequently and overall at
similar levels in isolates from pigs and humans (Table 2).
Such proﬁles were also scattered across farms in the
majority of cases, but only three occurred in isolates from
pigs and humans at the same farm (Table 3). In total, six
phenotypic proﬁles were shared by epidemiologically
related pig and human isolates (Table 3), with at least
one shared proﬁle found in 63 farms (data not shown).
An exchange of isolates and/or resistance genes between
the pig and the human population might partly explain
our observations, and it is clear that selective pressure for
cephalosporin resistance is high in both host species.
Within each shared phenotypic proﬁle, the highest pro-
portion of farms in which the proﬁle was shared by pig
and human isolates out of the total number of farms in
which the proﬁle was observed was moderate (38%)
(Table 3). This suggests that, although E. coli with iden-
tical cephalosporin resistance proﬁles can be detected in
pigs and humans, transmission across hosts is likely
affected by a complex of ecological factors beyond the
resistance determinants involved. Studies to understand
which contexts promote or limit transfer of identical
resistance determinants across host species in pig farms in
Vietnam are needed.

Phenotypic and genotypic detection of ESBL-producing
E. coli in faecal samples from farm workers and pigs

Phenotypic detection of ESBLs was performed in up to
two cefotaxime-resistant isolates per sample leading to a
total of 149 and 163 E. coli tested from porcine and
human samples, respectively. Phenotypic tests suggested
ESBL production in 101 (68.5%) isolates from pigs repre-
senting 66 farms and in 117 (71.8%) isolates from farm
workers from 69 farms. At 44 farms, E. coli with ESBL
phenotype were isolated both from pigs and from
humans. An ESBL phenotype was observed in isolates
across almost all resistance proﬁles (Table 2). In case of
FOX coresistance, a likely explanation is the presence of

*Only cephalosporins other than cefotaxime are reported since all isolates were resistant to cefotaxime.

AmpC-type beta-lactamases that mask the ESBL pheno-
type [35, 36]. In case of resistance to different third-gen-
eration cephalosporins (CFP, CRO, CPD along with
CTX resistance), occurrence of beta-lactam resistance
mechanisms other than enzymatic drug inactivation can-
not be excluded.

A total of 45 isolates from pigs (including 30 pheno-
typically positive and 15 isolates negative for ESBL pro-
duction) and 73 isolates from humans (including 50
isolates phenotypically positive and 23 negative for ESBL
production) were randomly selected for PCR targeting
the most common genes mediating beta-lactam resistance
in E. coli. Of pig isolates subjected to PCR, 66.7% were
positive for blaCTX-M only, 71.1% for blaTEM only, and
46.7% for both blaCTX-M and blaTEM (Table 2). Among
the samples from humans subjected to PCR, 68.5% were

positive for blaCTX-M only, 42.5% for blaTEM only and
24.7% for both blaCTX-M and blaTEM (Table 2). Occur-
rence of blaCTX-M was similar in isolates from pigs and
humans, whereas occurrence of blaTEM was higher in pigs
than in humans. Consequent to this, it was more com-
mon to observe these genes together in isolates from pigs
than in those from humans (Table 2). The reasons for
this are unknown, and it would be relevant to determine
whether blaCTX-M and blaTEM are genetically linked (e.g.
harboured on the same plasmid) and therefore co-
selected, in pig isolates. blaCTX-M was detected only
among isolates showing an ESBL phenotype, whereas
blaTEM was detected both among ESBL-positive and
ESBL-negative isolates (Table 2). The latter ﬁnding could
be due to the presence of non-ESBL TEM variants such
as TEM-1. Overall, it appeared that the ESBL phenotype

S. T. T. Dang et al. Cephalosporin-resistant E. coli in Vietnam

was mainly mediated by CTX-M enzymes and to a lesser
extent by TEM enzymes, thus being in line with ﬁndings
in pig farm environments in Europe and Asia
[18, 28, 33, 37]. Only three isolates from pigs and
humans displayed an ESBL phenotype and were negative
for the genes screened by PCR (Table 2), which suggests
that additional ESBL types may occur sporadically.
blaCTX-M was detected in isolates exhibiting different
cephalosporin resistance proﬁles (Table 2), thus suggest-
ing presence of different CTX-M variants and/or addi-
tional mechanisms contributing to cephalosporin
resistance (e.g. porin loss). Our ﬁndings show that the
epidemiology of cephalosporin resistance can be highly
complex also in a population from a restricted geographi-
cal area sampled during a limited time frame.

Exchange of ESBL-producing E. coli between pig and

pig farmers might have taken place at least in a subset
of the studied farms as the same resistance genes were
identiﬁed in eight of 11 cases in which isolates from
both sources sharing the same resistance proﬁles were
tested by PCR. Further genomic investigations including
plasmid analysis would be necessary to assess this
hypothesis, which is supported by studies in the Nether-
lands and in Denmark where highly related CTX-M-1-
encoding plasmids were detected in E. coli from pig and
pig farmers [29, 38]. The high occurrence of ESBL-pro-
ducing E. coli in pigs and pig farmers presents a risk for
spillover of these bacteria in Vietnamese communities
both via social interactions of the farmers and via food.
Human-human interactions are considered important
routes of transmission of ESBLs [39]. Pork contamina-
tion by ESBL-producing bacteria is very high in Viet-
nam, with a recent study showing that 40.6% of pork
samples sold in Nha Trang were ESBL-positive [14].
This is not surprising considering that E. coli originating
from the pigs’ own faeces or cross-contamination
between pigs slaughtered on the same day is an impor-
tant source of carcass contamination [39], and we have
shown in this study that pig faeces carry ESBL-produ-
cing E. coli at high prevalence. The human health conse-
quences of ESBLs in Vietnamese pork are unknown but
efforts should be made to reduce their numbers in line
with a precautionary principle.

Together with previous studies, our ﬁndings document
a strong and immediate need to strengthen control mea-
sures to ensure prudent antimicrobial use practices in Viet-
namese pig production. This includes coordinated efforts
across different ministries and authorities. Not only
should the antimicrobial use practices be changed and
access to quality, independent veterinary services
improved, but biosecurity measures at pig farms, including
use of disinfectants and vaccines, should be implemented.

Our study strongly indicates the urgent need to establish
integrated national programs of surveillance of antimicro-
bial use and occurrence of ESBL-producing E. coli (and
other antimicrobial-resistant bacteria with zoonotic poten-
tial) among people, livestock and foods in Vietnam.
