Meat  products  are  clearly  associated  with  foodborne  pathogens  including,  antibiotic-resistant  strains.  
Population growth and growing consumer demand facilitate the transmission of foodborne pathogens, 
particularly  in  developing  countries.  To  determine  the  prevalence  of  antibiotic-resistant  Salmonella  in 
goat  meat,  a  study  was  done  in  Tanzania  (June  to  July,  2015).  Overall  120  goat  meat  samples  were 
collected  from  five  large  and  five  small  slaughter  facilities  (n  =  60,  respectively).  Pre-enrichment  for 
Salmonella  isolation  was  done  in  Tryptic  Soy  Broth  followed  by  selective  enrichment  in  Modified 
Semisolid Rappaport-Vassiliadis agar. Isolation of Salmonella was done in xylose-Lysine-Deoxycholate 
agar  followed  by  biochemical  confirmation  in  triple  sugar  iron  agar.  The  average  prevalence  of 
Salmonella  was  60  and  63%  in  large  and  small  facilities,  respectively.  Breakpoint  assays  indicated  an 
overall low prevalence of resistance (2 to 4%; n = 219 isolates) to ampicillin, amoxicillin, streptomycin, 
sulphamethoxazole  and  trimethoprim  with  complete  susceptibility  to  ciprofloxacin,  ceftazidime  and 
cefotaxime. No significant difference (p > 0.05) in the prevalence of resistance between large and small 
facilities was observed. High probability of Salmonella contamination of goat meat from Arusha area of 
Tanzania  can  pose  risks  to  consumers.  Antibiotic  resistance  appears  minimal  in  this  population. 
Improved  hygienic  slaughter  and  meat-handling  practices  are  encouraged  to  reduce  the  burden  of 
Salmonella-positive meat products. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Meat,  including  goat  meat,  is  an  important  source  of 
protein  but  also  can  serve  as  a  potential  source  of 
foodborne  pathogens  (Economou  and  Gousia,  2015). 
 

Meat  products  are  typically  contaminated  during  the 
slaughter  process 
(Nouichi  and  Taha,  2009)  with 
pathogens such  as  Salmonella sp.,  Campylobacter  sp.,

Listeria  monocytogenes  and  pathogenic  strains  of 
Escherichia coli (Duffy et al., 2009; Gousia et al., 2011). 

Salmonellosis  is  a  common  foodborne  illness  and  is 
caused  by  a  very  diverse  group  of  Salmonella  enterica 
strains including S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and S. 
enterica serovar Enteritidis (de Freitas Neto et al., 2010). 
Salmonellosis  is  responsible  for  approximately  155,000 
worldwide  deaths  annually  (Majowicz  et  al.,  2010).  Sub-
Saharan regions  in  Africa bear  the  greatest  toll  of  global 
foodborne  disease  burden  where  70%  of  this  burden  is 
attributed  to  non-typhoidal  S.  enterica  (Havelaar  et  al., 
2015). People may acquire Salmonella infection either by 
consuming  contaminated  food products  and  water,  or  by 
direct  contact  with  infected  animals  (Pui  et  al.,  2011). 
Antibiotic-resistant  S.  enterica  serovar  Typhimurium 
strain  type  ST313  is  a  leading  cause  of  bacteremia 
among African adults and children. In sub-Saharan Africa 
ST313  infection  is  associated  with  a  case  fatality  rate  of 
20 to 25% (Feasey et al., 2012). 

Use  of  antibiotics  in  food-animal  agriculture  is  thought 
to  contribute  to  the  emergence  and  amplification  of 
antibiotic-resistant  strains  of  Salmonella  (Economou  and 
Gousia,  2015).  Although,  several  published  reports 
illustrate  how  antibiotic-resistant  (ABR)  bacteria  isolated 
from  food  animals  overlaps  with  those  causing  human 
infection  including  foodborne  illness  (Li  et  al.,  2013; 
Marshall and Levy, 2011), non-overlap trends of antibiotic 
resistance  infections  between  humans  and  animals  are 
also  reported  (Mather  et  al.,  2012). 
In  developing 
countries,  food  and  animal  products  pose  a  significant 
risk  of  transmission  for  both  pathogens  and  antibiotic-
resistant  bacteria  (Grace,  2015)  in  part  because  of 
unhygienic  practices  during  slaughter  and  product 
processing (Mensah et al., 2012). Population growth and 
rising  demand  of  goat  meat  in  Tanzania  for  local  and 
export markets has increased total goat meat production 
from  323,000  tons  in  2000/2001  to  449,673  tons  in 
2009/2010  and  consumption  projections  are  still 
increasing 
trend  may 
proportionately  increase  the  risk  of  zoonotic  infections 
associated  with  food  animals  in  Tanzania.  In  addition, 
limited  veterinary  services  and  poor  husbandry  practices 
might contribute to risks of zoonotic disease transmission 
(Mellau et al., 2010).  

(UNIDO, 

2012). 

This 

In Tanzania, large slaughter facilities operate mainly  in 
urban  centers  where  meat  condition  and  hygiene 
practices  are  inspected  by  municipal  inspectors  and 
health  officers,  respectively.  These  operations  receive 
slaughter  stock  from  local  traders  who  purchase  the 
animals  either  directly  from  local  livestock  keepers  or 
obtain the animals from primary and secondary  livestock 
markets.  Small  slaughter  facilities  are  located  in  rural 
areas  where 
inspection  of  meat  and  hygiene  are 
uncommon.  Small  slaughter  operators  obtain  slaughter 
stock  from  individual  livestock  keepers  and  primary 
livestock  markets  (NDO,  2008;  UNIDO,  2012).  In  the 
Arusha area of Tanzania, roasted goat meat is a  popular  

tube  containing  glycerol  (15%  vol/vol, 

 
 
 
 
food-animal product, made famous as Nyama Choma. To 
study  the  potential  contribution  of  goat  meat  in  the 
transmission of ABR bacteria to workers and consumers, 
we estimated the prevalence of ABR  Salmonella in fresh 
goat  meat  obtained  from  selected  large  and  small 
slaughter operations in Arusha district.  
 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Sample collection 
 
Ten  (10)  goat  slaughter  facilities  were  sampled  between  June  and 
July,  2015.  Depending  on  the  number  of  animals  slaughtered  per 
day, the facilities were grouped into five large (A, B, C, D and E; 10 
to 150 goat capacity per day) and five small (F, G,  H, I and; 1 to 3 
goat  capacity  per  day)  operations.  Meat  samples  (n  =  120,  250  g 
each)  were  purchased  from  five  large  (n  =  60  samples;  12  per 
facility)  and  five  small  slaughter  facilities  (n  =  60  samples;  12  per 
facility) and were placed in separate sterile polyethylene bags. Two 
to  three  samples  were  collected  weekly  from  each  facility  over  a 
period of 4 to 6 visits and were transported to laboratory in an ice-
cold box within 2 h of collection. In the laboratory subsamples were 
excised  (25  g  each)  and  were  washed  thoroughly  with  25  ml  of 
double-distilled  water  in  sterile  plastic  bags  by  soaking  and 
vigorously  shaking.  An  aliquot  (1  ml)  was  transferred  into  a  2  ml 
micro-centrifuge 
final 
concentration)  and  preserved  at  -20°C  for  future  use  if  required. 
The remaining portion of meat wash was collected in a 15 ml falcon 
tube  for  non-selective  pre-enrichment  of  Salmonella  in  the  same 
day. 
 
 
Isolation and identification of Salmonella 
 
An  aliquot  (1  ml)  of  meat  rinsate  was  homogenized  with  9  ml  of 
Tryptic  Soy  Broth  (TSB,  Becton,  Dickson  and  Company,  Sparks, 
MD)  and  incubated  overnight  at  37°C  to  pre-enrich  the  culture  for 
Salmonella  (El-Aziz,  2013;  Abakpa  et  al.,  2015).  After  incubation, 
30  µl  of  pre-enriched  inoculum  was  dropped  onto  Modified 
Semisolid  Rappaport-Vassiliadis  (MSRV,  Becton,  Dickson  and 
Company,  Sparks,  MD)  agar  plates  containing  2%  novobiocin 
(Becton, Dickson and Company, Sparks, MD). The plates were left 
to dry for 1 h and were then incubated at 42°C for 18 to 24 h. After 
incubation,  the  presumptive  motile  Salmonella  were  identified  by 
the formation of whitish halos around the drops. Sterile loops were 
used  to  pick  motile  Salmonella  from  the  periphery  of  halos  and 
streak  onto  Xylose-Lysine-Deoxycholate  Agar  (XLD,  HiMedia 
Laboratories  Pvt,  Ltd.  Mumbai,  India)  and  Xylose-Lysine-Tergitol  4 
(XLT4)  agar  containing  XLT4  agar  supplement  (Becton,  Dickson 
and  Company,  Sparks,  MD).  The  XLD  and  XLT4  plates  were 
incubated  at  35°C  for  48  h.  After  incubation,  the  plates  were 
observed  for  typical  pink  to  reddish  colonies  with  black  centers  on 
XLD  plates  that  were  considered  presumptive  Salmonella  sp.  and 
yellow  to  red  colonies  with  black  centers  on  XLT4  plates  were 
identified  as  considered  S.  enterica  serovar  Typhimurium.  Three 
isolates  per  sample  were  picked  with  sterile  toothpicks  and  sub-
cultured into 96-well plates containing 150 µl of LB broth (LBDifoTM, 
Becton,  Dickson  and  Company,  Sparks  MD).  The  plates  were 
incubated at 37°C for 18 to 24 h. After incubation, 40 µl of glycerol 
(15% vol/vol final concentration) was added. All plates were stored 
at -20°C (Akbar and Anal, 2014; Lyimo et al., 2016).  
 
 
Confirmation of Salmonella identity by biochemical test 
 
Presumptive  Salmonella  were  confirmed  by  triple  sugar  iron  (TSI) 
agar  (TSI,  Becton,  Dickson  and  Company,  Sparks,   MD)   using  

 
 
 
 
previously-described  procedures  (Addis  et  al.,  2011).  Pre-enriched 
bacterial culture (for each sample in TSB) was inoculated onto TSI 
agar slants using a sterile inoculating loop and incubated overnight 
at 37°C. After incubation, colonies that showed yellow and red color 
changes  in  the  butt  and  slope,  respectively,  with  blackening  of  the 
slope  due  to  production  of  hydrogen  sulfide  were  confirmed  as 
typical Salmonella.  
 
 
Antibiotic resistance testing in Salmonella 
 
Prior  to  antibiotic  testing,  the  frozen  96-well  culture  plates  were 
thawed  at  room  temperature  for  approximately  20  min  and  a 
duplicate  backup  plate  was  prepared  using  a  sterile  96-pin 
replicator.  Antibiotic  breakpoint  assays  were  performed  using 
procedures  previously  described  (Tadesse  et  al.,  2012)  and 
antibiotic  concentrations  were  prepared  using  recommendations 
guided  by  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standard  Institute  (CLSI,  2007). 
The  following  medically  important  antibiotics  were  included  in  the 
assays;  ampicillin,  32  µg/ml  (Amp,  VWR 
International  LLC, 
Sanborn,  NY);  amoxicillin,  32  µg/ml  (Amx,  MP  Biomedicals LLC); 
chloramphenicol,  32  µg/ml  (Chl,  Medaitech  Inc);  ciprofloxacin,  4 
µg/ml  (Cip,  Enzo  Life  Sciences  Inc);  ceftazidime,  8  µg/ml  (Cfz, 
SIGMA-ALDRICH, St. Louis, MO); cefotaxime, 4 µg/ml (Cfx, Chem-
Impex  International  LLC);  gentamicin,  16  µg/ml  (Gen,  Mediatech 
Inc.); streptomycin, 16 µg/ml (Str, Amresco Inc); sulfamethoxaxole, 
512 µg/ml (Sul, MP Biomedicals, LLC); tetracycline, 16 µg/ml (Tet, 
MP  Biomedicals  LLC);  and 
trimethoprim,  8  µg/ml  (Tri,  MP 
Biomedicals, LLC).

About  1-2  µl  of  bacterial  inoculum  (~104  CFU  per  spot)  was 
picked  using  a  sterile  96-pin  replicator  and  transferred  onto 
MacConkey  agar  (MAC,  Becton,  Dickson  and  Company,  Sparks, 
MD) plates containing each antibiotic. The plates were left to dry at 
room temperature for 15 min and were then incubated overnight at 
37°C.  After 
the  presence  of  antibiotic-resistant 
Salmonella  was  evident  when  an  isolate  grew  on  agar  plate 
containing  an  antibiotic.  E.  coli  K12  was  used  as  negative  control 
(susceptible  to  all  tested  antibiotics)  and  E.  coli  NM-1  (resistant  to 
ampicillin, 
streptomycin, 
sulfamethoxazole,  tetracycline  and  trimethoprim)  and  E.  coli  NM-2 
(resistant  to  ampicillin,  amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid,  ceftazidime, 
ciprofloxacin, 
sulfamethoxazole, 
tetracycline  and  trimethoprim)  were  used  as  positive  control 
organisms  (Lyimo  et  al.,  2016).  NM-1  and  NM-2  were  originally 
recovered  from  water  sources  in  Northern  Tanzania  and  their 
resistance  phenotypes  were  characterized  at  Nelson  Mandela 
African  Institution  of  Science  and  Technology  (Arusha,  Tanzania) 
and at Washington State University (Pullman, WA, USA) using the 
antibiotic breakpoint assays previously described (Rugumisa et al., 
2016). 
 
 
Statistical analysis 
 
All data were summarized by using descriptive statistics and tables 
and the difference in prevalence of Salmonella recovered from goat 
meat  samples  was  assessed  between  large  and  small  slaughter 
operations by using a two-sample Student's t-test. A comparison of 
prevalence  of  antibiotic-resistant  Salmonella  within  and  between 
large and small facilities across tested antibiotics was complete by 
using  a  two-factor  analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  F-statistic  and  a 
TukeyHSD post hoc test (R software version 3.2.2). All results at  p 
< 0.05 were considered statistically significant. 
 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Salmonella  was   recovered   from   >50%   of   all   meat 

Mwanyika et al.          1317 

 
 
 
samples  with  approximately  4%  having  traits  consistent 
with  S.  enterica  serovar  Typhimurium.  A  low  prevalence 
of  Salmonella  Typhimurium  was  also  reported  by  others 
in  other  food  animal  products  such  as  11%  in  beef 
(Shilangale et al., 2015), 10.8% in cattle and sheep meat 
and  4.35%  in  poultry  meat  (Mezali  and  Hamdi,  2012). 
There  was  no  significant  difference  (p  =  0.65)  in  the 
prevalence between large and small facilities (Table 1). A 
high  prevalence  of  Salmonella  contamination  in  goat 
meat is consistent with deficits in the procedures used to 
process  goats  for  meat.  Qualitatively,  it  was  observed 
that  goats  were  held  for  a  longer  time  in  the  secondary 
markets  before  being  transported  to  slaughter  facilities, 
increasing  the  chance  of  animal-animal  contamination 
attributed  to  excretion  while  crowding  of  animals  at 
waiting  pans  before  slaughter  might  have  contributed  to 
more  transmission  of  bacteria.  In  some  areas,  slaughter 
facilities  were  located  closer  to  live  goat  auctions, 
presumably  increasing  the  risk  of  further  transmission. 
Furthermore, 
cross-
contamination  of  carcasses  through  the  use  of  the 
unclean  knives  and  other  utensils  for  different  animal 
carcasses and possibly the carriage of Salmonella sp., by 
personnel  working  at  these  facilities  might  be  another 
source of carcass contamination.

These observations  are  consistent  to findings  reported 
in  Australia  by  Duffy  et  al.  (2009)  who  found  that  the 
prevalence  of  Salmonella  contamination  on  goat 
carcasses varied from 3 to 45% in the morning and 20 to 
40%  in  the  evening  hours,  as  a  result  of  that  which  was 
attributed  to  poor  handling  practices.  In  Ethiopia,  a  high 
carriage (80%) of Salmonella sp., was reported in various 
organs  of  apparently  healthy  slaughtered  goats 
(Woldemariam  et  al.,  2005)  suggesting  that  carrier 
sources  of  Salmonella 
animals  were  potential 
contamination 
facilities. 
low-income 
countries  like  Tanzania,  it  is  common  to  encounter 
inadequate  food  hygiene  standards  in  meat  production 
systems (Roesel and Grace, 2014). For the current study, 
the 
non-Typhimurium  Salmonella 
contaminated goat meat (>50% of carcasses) was higher 
than other published reports from Pakistan (8%), Ethiopia 
(3.8%)  and  Burkina  Faso  (7%)  (Eze  and  Ivuoma,  2012; 
Kagambèga  et  al.,  2011;  Tadesse  and  Gebremedhin, 
2015). This discrepancy may be attributed to inconsistent 
slaughter  practices  but  might  also  be  attributed  to 
differences  in  pre-enrichment  and  isolation  procedures 
employed  across  these  studies.  The  low  prevalence  of 
serovar Typhimurium isolates (4%) is also consistent with 
the  majority  of  contamination  arising  from  environmental 
exposure during slaughter (Maharjan et al., 2006),  which 
is an outcome that can clearly be addressed with greater 
attention  to  good  hygiene  practices.  The  majority  of 
recovered  Salmonella  isolates  (>96%)  were  susceptible 
to  all  of  the  tested  antibiotics  (Table  2)  with  no  clear 
differences (p > 0.05) between large and small slaughter 
facilities (Table 1). Between large facilities, there  was  no

between 4.6 and 18.2% (Molla et al., 2006). In contrast, a 
high  prevalence  of  antibiotic-resistant  Salmonella  to 
ampicillin 
(45.5%),  streptomycin 
(81.8%),  sulphonamide  (42%)  and  Trimethoprim  (75%) 
was reported for goat meat in eastern Ethiopia (Ferede et 
al.,  2015).  Presumable, 
reflect 
differences  in  exposure  to  antibiotics,  bacterial  diversity 
and  selection  pressure 
the  natural  environment 
(Sharma  and  Bist,  2010).  Importantly,  while  a  very  low 
prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella in goat meat 
from Tanzania is observed, growing consumer demand in 
Tanzania 
increased 
production efforts and potentially  an  increasing  reliance 

(UNIDO,  2012)  will 

result 

in 

these  differences 

in 

include 

of  antibiotics  for  food  animal  production  and  a  potential 
commensurate  increase  in  the  prevalence  of  antibiotic-
resistant  Salmonella.  Examples 
reports  of 
increased  prevalence  of  Salmonella  from  poultry  and 
beef  that  are  resistant  to  fluoroquinolones  and  third-
generation cephalosporins (Ahmed et al., 2014; Cabrera-
Diaz et al., 2013; M’ikanatha et al., 2010). The increased 
use of antibiotics during animal breeding can introduce a 
selective  pressure  that  leads  to  the  development  of 
resistance  or  even  multi-resistance  characteristics  in 
some bacterial populations (Chen and Jiang, 2014). 

Occurrence  of  Salmonella  isolates  that  were  resistant 
to ≥1 antibiotic was uncommon (10.5% of 219). Of  these,  

resistance

the most prevalent multidrug resistance at larger facilities 
included 
to  ampicillin,  chloramphenicol, 
streptomycin,  sulfamethoxazole  and  tetracycline  (7.8%) 
and  resistance 
to  ampicillin,  sulfamethoxazole  and 
tetracycline  (5.7%)  in  small  facilities.  This  is  dramatically 
different  from  the  prevalence  of  multidrug  resistant 
isolates  (≥1  antibiotic)  recently  reported  from  water 
sources  in  northern  Tanzania  (88.5%)  (Lyimo  et  al., 
2016).  If  the  lack  of  overlap in antibiotic  resistance  is  an 
appropriate  metric,  then  it  is  likely  that  goats  are  not  a 
significant  contributor  to  Salmonella  contamination  in 
these  waters.  In  addition,  the  prevalence  of  multi-drug 
resistant  Salmonella  observed  in  this  study  is  lower 
compared to prevalence reported from other food animals 
in  Sudan  (33.3  to  66.6%),  Ethiopia  (93.2%),  United 
States  (62%)  and  Korea  (87.2%)  (Fadlalla  et  al.,  2012; 
Ferede  et  al.,  2015;  Khaitsa  et  al.,  2007;  Kim  et  al., 
2012).  This  difference  may  suggest 
low  antibiotics 
consumption  in  goat  populations  raised  from  Arusha 
area.  Further  studies  are  required  to  directly  assess  the 
impact of this practice. The present study indicates a high 
probability  (>50%)  that  goat  meat  carcasses  from  the 
Arusha  area  are  contaminated  with  Salmonella. 
Fortunately,  antibiotic  resistance  strains  were  detected 
infrequently.  Nevertheless,  producers,  processors  and 
consumers  should  be  alerted  to  better  carcass  and 
product  handling  practices 
the  risk  of 
Salmonella transmission from these products.
