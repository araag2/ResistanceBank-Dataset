Escherichia coli O157 strains cause diseases in humans that result from the consumption of food and water
contaminated with faeces of infected animals and/or individuals. The objectives of this study were to isolate
and characterise E. coli O157 strains from humans, cattle and pigs and to determine their antibiotic resistant
proﬁles as well as detection of virulence genes by PCR. Eight hundred faecal samples were analysed for
typical E. coli O157 and 76 isolates were positively identiﬁed as E. coli O157 strains. 16S rRNA sequence data
were used to conﬁrm the identity of the isolates. Susceptibility proﬁles to 9 antibiotics were determined and
the multiple antibiotic resistant (MAR) patterns were compiled. A large proportion (52.6%–92.1%) of the
isolates from pigs, cattle and humans were resistant to tetracycline, sulphamethoxazole and erythromycin.
Thus the phenotype Smx–T–E (sulphamethozaxole–tetracycline–erythromycin) was present in most of
the predominant MAR phenotypes obtained. Cluster analysis of antibiotic resistances revealed a closer
relationship between isolates from pig and human faeces than cattle and humans. PCR were performed to
amplify STEC virulence and tetracycline resistance gene fragments. A tetB gene fragment was ampliﬁed
among the isolates. Eighteen (60%) of the isolates possessed the hlyA gene and 7(23.3%) the eae gene while
only 5(16.7%) possessed both genes. Although shiga toxin genes were detected in the E. coli O157:H7 positive
control strain none of the isolates that were screened possessed these genes. In a related study we reported
that the prevalence of E. coli O157 was higher in pigs than cattle and humans. A high market demand for pork
and beef in South Africa ampliﬁes the risk that diseased animals pose to human health. This highlighted the
need for proper hygiene management to reduce the prevalence of E. coli O157 in farm animals and prevent
the spread from animals to humans.

1. Introduction

Escherichia coli O157 are the predominant strains of the shiga
toxin-producing E. coli that cause infections to humans in many parts
of the world including the Southern African region (Armstrong et al.,
1996; WHO, 1997; Browning et al., 1990; Dunn et al., 2004). These
diseases range from simple diarrhoea to the more complicated
haemorrhagic colitis (HC) and haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS)
(Browning et al., 1990; Armstrong et al., 1996; Smith et al., 2003; Dunn
et al., 2004). The pathogenicity of E. coli O157 strains result from the
production of virulence genes and stx1, stx2 and its variants, eae and
hlyA are the most frequently identiﬁed (Brunder et al., 1999; Gioffre
et al., 2002; Paton and Paton, 2002; Smith et al., 2003).

Most infections caused by E. coli O157 result from the consumption
of food and water contaminated with faecal matter of infected animals
(Riley et al., 1983; Armstrong et al., 1996; Muhldorfer et al., 1996;
Müller et al., 2001; Dunn et al., 2004). In South Africa both environ-
mental and foodborne sources of E. coli O157 pose threats to human
health (Müller et al., 2001; Ateba et al., 2008). Although E. coli O157 is
frequently isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of several animal
species in some European countries (Chapman et al., 1993; Armstrong
et al., 1996; Pritchard et al., 2000; Bryan et al., 2004; Mi-Yeong et al.,
2004), there is little information available on the prevalence of this
pathogen in the faeces of animals in South Africa (WHO, 1997; Müller
et al., 2001; Ateba et al., 2008). Furthermore, very few cases of
infections caused by this pathogen are documented in South Africa
(Browning et al., 1990; WHO, 1997) since patients rarely report their
cases to the hospital (Müller et al., 2001). In a related study, the
prevalence of E. coli O157 in pigs and cattle was higher than that from
human stool samples (Ateba et al., 2008). Moreover, the animals that
harboured these isolates were asymptomatic while the human
subjects presented with cases of diarrhoea. Thus, from a clinical
point of view, determining the prevalence of these virulence genes
within an isolated E. coli O157 population could help in reducing the
incidence of diseases in humans.

It is generally discouraged to treat STEC infections with antibiotics
(Yoh and Honda, 1997; Igarashi et al., 1999) as they may induce shiga-
toxins and increase the chances of the disease to progress to HUS
(Wong et al., 2000; Dundas et al., 2001). However, studies have also
revealed that E. coli O157 isolates are resistant to antibiotics (Galland
et al., 2001; Zhao et al., 2001; Schroeder et al., 2002; Bettelheim et al.,
2003; Wilkerson et al., 2004). Determining the antibiotic resistant
phenotypes of these pathogens may reveal the distribution of
antibiotic resistant genes within the population and thus provide
suggestions that could help in the control of antibiotic resistance. The
aim of the study was to characterise E. coli O157 strains isolated from
faeces of cattle, pigs and human stool samples using their antibiotic
resistance proﬁles and STEC virulence genes.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Bacterial strains

In this study, 800 faecal samples were collected from communal
cattle and pigs as well as humans. The human stool samples were
obtained from the bacteriology laboratory of a local provincial
hospital. Samples were collected from patients that visited the
hospital for cases of diarrhoea and were provided without indication
of patient identity. All samples were handled with care during
bacterial isolation and were incinerated immediately after analysis.

Animal faecal samples were collected directly from the rectum of
animals using sterile arm-length gloves. Pig faeces samples were
collected from animals from commercial and communal farms in
Mareetsane and Tlapeng, respectively. Samples from cattle were
collected from commercial farms in Lichtenburg and Rustenburg and a
communal farm in Mogosane. Animal samples were placed in sterile
sample collection bottles, immediately placed on ice and transferred
to the laboratory for analysis. Positive and negative controls were
E. coli O157:H7 (ATCC 43889) and E. coli O157:H7 (ATCC 43888),
respectively. The former possessed stx1, stx2, eae and hlyA genes while
the latter was negative for all these genes.

Enrichment, isolation and identiﬁcation for E. coli O157 were
achieved using methods outlined by Ateba et al. (2008). A loopful of
the faecal sample was inoculated into MacConkey broth medium
(3 ml) [Biolab, Merck (South Africa)] and incubated at 37 °C for 18 to
24 h. After incubation a tenfold serial dilution was performed with
sterile distilled water and aliquots (100 μl) of each dilution was plated
onto Sorbitol MacConkey agar [Biolab, Merck (South Africa)]. Plates
were incubated at 37 °C for 18 to 24 h. Potential E. coli isolates were
subcultured onto sorbitol MacConkey agar and the plates were incu-
bated at 37 °C for 18 to 24 h. Isolates were Gram stained (Cruikshank
et al., 1975) and pure Gram negative rods were retained for bio-
chemical identiﬁcation. Primary (oxidase test, triple sugar iron agar
test) and secondary (API 20E, E. coli O157 rapid slide agglutination
test) identiﬁcation tests were utilized. E. coli O157 isolates were stored
as 30% glycerol stocks at −4 °C for further characterisation.

2.2. Antibiotic susceptibility test

Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed on all E. coli O157
isolates to determine their antibiotic resistant proﬁles using the paper
disc diffusion method (Kirby et al., 1966). Brieﬂy isolates were grown
on sorbitol MacConkey agar at 37 °C for 18 to 24 h. Bacterial sus-
pensions were prepared and aliquots of 100 μl were spread over
Mueller Hinton agar. Antimicrobial disks impregnated with strepto-
mycin (10 μg), erythromycin (15 μg), tetracycline (30 μg), ampicillin
(10 μg), neomycin (30 μg), norﬂoxacin (10 μg), kanamycin (30 μg),
sulphamethoxazole (10 μg) and chloramphenicol (30 μg) were
obtained from Mast Diagnostics (United Kingdom). These disks
(6 µm in diameter) were placed on the surface of the inoculated agar
plates and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 18 to 24 h. After
incubation, the antibiotic inhibition zone diameters (IZD) were mea-
sured. Results obtained were used to classify isolates as being resistant,
intermediate resistant or susceptible to a particular antibiotic using
standard reference values (NCCLS, 1999). Isolates that were resistant to
tetracycline were screened for the presence of tet resistant genes.
MAR phenotypes were generated for isolates that showed resistance to
3 and more antibiotics (Rota et al., 1996).

2.3. Haemolysis on blood agar

Haemolysis, on blood agar (Biolab, Merck, S. A.) supplemented
with 5% (v/v) sheep blood, was determined for E. coli O157 isolates
(Beutin et al., 1998). The genotype was conﬁrmed by PCR using hlyA
speciﬁc primers (Paton and Paton, 1998).

2.4. Extraction of genomic DNA and PCR

Genomic DNA was extracted from E. coli O157 isolates using
the hot (65 °C) CTAB (cetyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide) — PVP

(polyvinylpyrrolidone) DNA extraction procedure of Doyle and Doyle
(1990). The DNA concentration was determined using an aquamate
spectrophotometer (Thermo Spectronic, Mercers Row, Cambridge
CB58HY UK) by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm.

PCR reactions were performed to amplify bacterial 16S rRNA gene
fragments (Muyzer et al., 1995) as well as detection of STEC virulence
genes (Paton and Paton 1998) and tetracycline resistant genes
(Miranda et al., 2003) using oligonucleotide primer combinations
indicated in Table 1. A Peltier Thermal Cycler (model-PTC-220 DYAD™
DNA ENGINE) was used for the PCR ampliﬁcations. The reactions were
performed in 25 μl volumes comprising of 1 μM of the template DNA,
50 pmol of each oligonucleotide primer set, 1X PCR master mix, 50 ng
bovine serum albumen, 1 U Taq DNA polymerase and RNase free
distilled water. All the PCR reagents were Fermentas, USA products.
The ampliﬁcations were performed at 95 °C for 300 s; 45 cycles of
95 °C for 30 s; 62 °C for 60 s; 72 °C for 60 s and a ﬁnal elongation step at
72 °C for 300 s. Both positive and negative control reactions were
included in each PCR ampliﬁcation experiment.

PCR products were cooled at 4 °C and resolved by electrophoresis
on a 1% (wt/v) agarose gel in a horizontal Pharmacia biotech equip-
ment system (model Hoefer HE 99X). Each run contained a DNA
molecular weight marker (Lambda DNA — Hind III digest) obtained
from Roche Biochemicals, Germany. The gels were stained with
ethidium bromide (0.001 µg/ml) for 15 min and observed under UV
light at a wavelength of 420 nm (Sambrook et al., 1989). A Gene Genius
Bio Imaging System (Syngene, Synoptics UK) was used to capture
the image using GeneSnap (version 6.00.22) software. Images were

2.5. Sequence analysis

Ampliﬁed 16S rRNA gene fragments were sequenced by Inqaba
Biotec, Pretoria — South Africa. Blast searches (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/BLAST) were used to conﬁrm the identity of the ampliﬁed
sequences.

2.6. Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using the Minitab Release
software (version 13.31). Correlations between antibiotic resistant
E. coli O157 isolates from the various species were determined using
the Pearson's product of moment and were scored as signiﬁcant if
P b0.05. Furthermore, cluster analysis of antibiotic susceptibility data
for E. coli O157 isolated from the different stations was determined
using Wards algorithm and Euclidean distances on Statistica version
7.0 (Statsoft, US).

3. Results

3.1. Antibiotic resistant data of E. coli O157 isolated from the different
species at various sampling stations

A total of 76 E. coli O157 isolates were positively identiﬁed from the
different host species. These comprised 37 isolates from commercial
(Mareetsane) pig faeces and 23 from pig faeces obtained from the
communal (Tlapeng) farm. Furthermore, 4, 5 and 4 isolates were
obtained from cattle faeces obtained from the commercial farms in
Lichtenburg, Rustenburg and a communal
farm at Mogosane,
respectively. Only 3 E. coli O157 isolates were obtained from human
stool samples. All the E. coli O157 isolated as well as E. coli control
strains were tested to evaluate their susceptibilities to 9 different

antibiotics. Results obtained are depicted in Table 2. A large proportion
(83.8% to 100%) of E. coli O157 isolated from pig faeces from both the
communal and commercial farms were resistant to tetracycline,
erythromycin and sulphamethoxazole. None and 4.3% of E. coli O157
isolated from pig faeces from the communal farm were resistant to
norﬂoxacin and neomycin, respectively. Despite the fact that 5.4% of
the isolates from pig faeces obtained from the commercial farm were
resistant to norﬂoxacin a large proportion (43.2%) of these were
resistant to neomycin.

All the E. coli O157 isolated from cattle faeces from the commercial
and communal farms from Lichtenburg and Mogosane were resistant
to erythromycin, tetracycline and sulphamethoxazole (Table 2). On the
other hand, none of the isolates from cattle from the Rustenburg
commercial farm were resistant to tetracycline. A low percentage (25%
to 50%) of E. coli O157 isolated from communal cattle from Mogosane

were resistant to chloramphenicol, kanamycin, ampicillin and
streptomycin. None of the isolates from cattle faeces obtained from
any of the farms were resistant to either neomycin or norﬂoxacin.

As indicated in Table 2, all three of E. coli O157 isolated from human
stool samples were resistant to erythromycin, tetracycline, ampicillin
and sulphamethoxazole. Similarly, the two E. coli control strains were
resistant to erythromycin and sulphamethoxazole while one was
resistant to tetracycline. Neither the control strains nor the E. coli O157
isolated from human stool samples were resistant to norﬂoxacin,
kanamycin and streptomycin.

3.2. MAR phenotypes of E. coli O157 isolated from pigs, cattle
and humans

The predominant antibiotic resistant phenotypes that were
obtained for the E. coli O157 isolated from cattle, pig and human
faeces respectively, are shown in Table 3. The MAR phenotypes S–
Smx–T–E and Smx–T–E were dominant among 30.4% and 16.2% of
the communal (Tlapeng) and commercial (Mareetsane) pig isolates,
respectively.

The dominating MAR phenotype amongst E. coli O157 isolated
from cattle faeces was Smx–T–E in 100% of the isolates from the
commercial farm in Lichtenburg. However, the MAR phenotypes Smx–
T–E–C, K–S–Smx–T–E, S–Smx–T–E and Smx–T–E–Ap were observed
in 25% of the communal (Mogosane) isolates. The MAR phenotypes for
E. coli O157 isolated from commercial cattle in Rustenburg were not
included as resistance was shown only to two antibiotics (Table 3).

The MAR phenotypes of two of the three E. coli O157 isolated from
human stool samples were Smx–T–E–Ap while one of the isolates
presented with Smx–T–E. MAR phenotypes for control strains were
not included since resistance was observed to less than three
antibiotics. The phenotype Smx–T–E was present in all the predomi-
nant MAR phenotypes for E. coli O157 isolated from pig and cattle
faeces and human stool samples (Table 3).

3.3. Cluster analysis of E. coli O157 for multiple antibiotic resistance
(MAR) relationship on a dendogram

A total of 76 E. coli O157 isolated from pigs, cattle and humans were
subjected to cluster analysis using their IZD data and a dendogram
was generated. This approach was used as a tool in determining the
commonness and in resolving differences between the MAR pheno-
types of E. coli O157 isolates. The dendogram in Fig. 1 indicates four
major clusters (I–IV) that were further analysed for patterns of
associations of isolates from the different species (Table 4). Of the
E. coli O157 isolated from pigs, 19 (90.5%) were present in the largest
cluster (cluster IV) along with 2 (9.5%) of the E. coli O157 isolated
from communal cattle from Mogosane. The second largest cluster
(cluster II) contained 10 (52.6%) of the E. coli O157 isolated from pigs
and included the E. coli O157 isolates from faeces of pigs and cattle
from both commercial farms. Cluster III was a mixed cluster contain-
ing E. coli isolated from all three species. All the three E. coli O157
isolated from human stool samples were present in this cluster
including a large proportion (77.8% or 14) of isolates from pig faeces.
The smallest cluster (cluster I) was represented mostly by E. coli O157

isolated from pigs. The cluster analysis indicated that E. coli O157
isolated from faeces samples of pig and cattle potentially had similar
antibiotic resistance histories as those of the human E. coli O157
isolates. E. coli O157 isolated from pigs faeces from Tlapeng and
Mareetsane, cattle faeces from Mogosane and human stool samples
clustered together (Cluster III). These villages are close to the Maﬁkeng
Provincial hospital that serves the area and could possibly indicate
that the individuals sampled might have come from these villages.
However, information on the residence of the individuals from which
the samples were obtained was not available.

3.4. Detection of E. coli O157 virulence genes and tetracycline resistant
genes

A total of thirty E. coli O157 consisting of 20 isolated from the
faeces samples of pigs, 7 from cattle and 3 from human stool samples
were randomly selected and characterised by PCR analysis for the
presence of shiga toxin virulence genes and tetracycline resistant
genes. Speciﬁc PCR analysis for the detection of E. coli O157 virulence
genes and tetracycline resistant genes were performed using speciﬁc
primers for the targeted genes (Table 1). Table 5 depicts a summary of
the genotypic characteristics of E. coli O157 isolated from pigs, cattle,
humans and E. coli control strains. As indicated in Table 5, a large
proportion (60%) of the E. coli O157 isolates possessed the enter-
ohaemolysin A (hlyA) gene while only a small proportion (23.3%)
possessed the eae gene. Furthermore, only 5(16.7%) of the isolates
possessed both genes. A cause for concern was the fact that not all the
E. coli O157 isolates that were haemolytic on blood agar possessed the
hlyA gene. There was a higher prevalence of the hlyA gene in E. coli
O157 isolated from pigs than in cattle and humans. Moreover, none of
the E. coli O157 isolated from human stool samples possessed both
genes.

The tetB gene fragment was detected in a small proportion (3.3%)
of the isolates. Despite this none of the other tetracycline resistant
genes tested was detected. Studies carried out to determine the cause
of resistance to tetracycline have identiﬁed various tetracycline genes
but in different proportions (Bryan et al., 2004). In a related study
involving E. coli isolated from humans and animals, resistance was
found to result from the presence of 14 tetracycline resistant genes
and a large proportion (63%) of these isolates harboured the tetB
resistant determinant (Bryan et al., 2004).

4. Discussion

One of the objectives of this study was to determine to what
extent E. coli O157 isolated from cattle and pigs, which may enter the
food chain and be transmitted to humans, are resistant to antibiotics.
A motivation to this was the fact that there has been increasing
reports on the isolation and identiﬁcation of antibiotic resistant E. coli
O157 strains (Meng et al., 1998; Galland et al., 2001; Schroeder et al.,
2002; Vali et al., 2004; Ahmed et al., 2005; Vidovic and Korber, 2006).
In the present study multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR), deﬁned as
resistance to three or more different classes of antibiotics, was
observed in 71(93.4%) of the E. coli O157 isolated. The detection of a
large proportion of MAR E. coli O157 isolates in the present study was
a cause for concern as these could pose health risks to humans.
Resistant genetic elements from these isolates could also be
transferred to other enteric bacteria of clinical importance. This
ampliﬁed the importance to characterise these isolates using
molecular methods.

The frequencies of resistance to tetracycline, sulphamethoxazole
and erythromycin were higher among E. coli O157 isolated from pigs
than cattle and humans. However, a cause for concern was the fact
that all three E. coli O157 isolated from human stool samples were
resistant to these antibiotics. This may have resulted through the
consumption of contaminated food products. In a previous study,

186

C.N. Ateba, C.C. Bezuidenhout / International Journal of Food Microbiology 128 (2008) 181–188

(Schroeder et al., 2002) E. coli O157 isolates obtained revealed
similarly marked resistance to these drugs. Tetracycline is generally
used in animal medicine and as a growth promoter but less
frequently used to treat infections in humans. On the contrary
resistance to sulphamethoxazole and erythromycin was a cause for
concern since these drugs are not used on animals in the sampled
area.

In South Africa, a large proportion of the population relies on pork
and beef as a source of food. A majority of the cases of infections
caused by E. coli O157 have been found to result from the consumption
of undercooked contaminated animal food products and/or contami-
nated water (Isaäcson et al., 1993; Paquet et al., 1993; Armstrong et al.,
1996; Anonymous, 2000; Müller et al., 2001; Olsen et al., 2002). This
ampliﬁes the importance of reducing the prevalence of these
pathogens and their associated resistant genes in animals, their food
products and/or drinking water especially as they may cause disease
at a very low infectious dose. However, in a previous study (Ateba
et al., 2008) we reported that the prevalence of E. coli O157 was high in
the animal species sampled. Our ﬁndings in the present documenta-
tion indicate that a large proportion of those isolates were resistant to
most of the antibiotics tested. The situation was even worse in sub-
sistence settings where animals were seen drinking water from
rainfall runoffs and pigs sometimes feed on human excreta. Rainfall
runoffs may have increased the chances of transmitting antibiotic
resistant determinants to E. coli O157 strains isolated from animal
species and later to humans. Despite the fact that the antibiotic
resistant data did not clearly indicate a direct transmission of resistant
E. coli O157 strains through diet, the high proportion of isolates that
were resistant to commonly used antibiotics among those from
communal farms and human stool samples was a cause for concern.
We recommend that proper hygiene practices should be enforced
in the farms were animals are kept and during the slaughtering
process. In all the rural areas sampled during the study, humans rely
on ground water. This may have been an effective route for the
transmission of these pathogens to humans since the microbial eco-
system of pigs, cattle and humans in those communities may have
been interconnected.

Another objective of the study was to use a PCR technique to detect
virulence genes in E. coli O157 isolated from the faeces samples of
cattle and pigs and human stool samples in the North-West Province
of South Africa. Although none of the E. coli O157 isolates obtained in
the present study possessed the shiga toxin genes when compared to
the positive control strain, the frequencies of the eae and hlyA genes
were higher in isolates obtained from pig faeces than cattle and
human stool samples. Similar observations had been reported
(Frydendahl, 2002; Hornitzky et al., 2002), but our results contradict
the ﬁnding that the eae gene exists in association with the shiga toxin
genes (Pradel et al., 2000; Johnsen et al., 2001; Omisakin et al., 2003).
The high prevalence of the eae gene in a large proportion of E. coli
O157 isolated from non-diarrhoeal pigs indicated that pigs could serve
as a potential source for the transmission of disease to humans. The
eae gene codes for intimin that facilitates the intimate attachment of
bacteria to host cell wall (Oswald et al., 2000) and has been identiﬁed
as an important accessory virulence factor that correlates with disease
(Gyles et al., 1998). However, the eae gene was detected in 1 of the 3
E. coli O157 isolated from human stool samples from diarrhoeal
patients. Several reports have been documented that contradict the
role of eae gene in the pathogenesis of human disease (Heuvelink
et al., 1996; Chapman et al., 1997; Paton and Paton, 2002; Beutin et al.,
2004). We recommend that more studies should be carried out to
determine their exact contribution in the development of infections in
humans.

The hlyA gene was absent in some of the E. coli O157 isolates that
were phenotypically haemolytic and this was contrary to the notion
that its presence confers such a property. However, its presence in a
large proportion of the E. coli O157 isolates could have resulted from

the fact that it can be easily transferred among bacterial species since
it is plasmid encoded (Schmidt et al., 1999). In the present study,
none of the isolates from human stool samples harboured both the
eae and hlyA genes. Very few of the isolates from pigs and cattle
possessed both the eae and hlyA genes despite a report that
indicated that the hlyA gene is usually present in eae positive
isolates (Tarr et al., 2002). However, the hlyA gene was more
prevalent in E. coli O157 isolated from pigs than cattle and than
humans. Our ﬁndings were similar to previously reported data
(Frydendahl, 2002; Hornitzky et al., 2002) and this may suggest that
pigs are easily colonised by hlyA positive E. coli strains.

Another goal of the study was to characterise antibiotic resistant
E. coli O157 strains isolated from animal species and humans using
PCR. This was motivated by the fact that a large proportion of the E.
coli O157 isolated from both humans and animals were resistant to
three or more antibiotics. A large proportion of the isolates were
resistant to tetracycline (Table 2) and this highlighted the need to
screen isolates for the presence of
four different tetracycline
resistant genes (tetA to tetD). Only a tetB gene was identiﬁed in E.
coli O157 isolated from pig faeces. In a study carried out on E. coli
isolated from humans and animals, the tetB gene was detected in
63% of the isolates (Bryan et al., 2004) while the tetA gene was most
prevalent among isolates obtained in another study (Sengeløv et al.,
2003). Resistance to tetracycline in the present study may have
resulted from the presence of other tet genes that were not tested.
Resistance may have also resulted from the presence of integrons
that are easily transferred through conjugation (Zhao et al., 2001)
but whose presence in the isolates were not investigated. However,
no information has been documented on the distribution of
integrons among E. coli O157 isolates from humans and animals in
the sampled area. Further studies will be conducted to determine
their contribution in the dissemination of antibiotic resistant genes
among these pathogens. This would provide a clear picture of the
health risks associated with the consumption of contaminated food
products.

5. Conclusion

An evaluation of samples was made. Results indicated that the
level of multiple antibiotic resistant (MAR) E. coli O157 was high in
all samples examined. Although the study was not designed to
demonstrate a direct link between the consumption of contami-
nated meat products and development of antimicrobial resistance in
E. coli O157 isolated from humans, the high prevalence of MAR E.
coli O157 in pigs suggest that these animals may pose a health
risk in the sampled area. These isolates may have negative clinical
implications and hence hamper the treatment of E. coli O157
infections. We suggest
there is a need to implement
surveillance programmes that monitor the prevalence and/or
antimicrobial resistance among zoonotic foodborne pathogens
especially E. coli O157. This should contribute to reducing the
occurrence of E. coli O157 infections in humans and ensure proper
public health. Further work on conjugation experiments between
the E. coli isolates obtained in this study and other pathogens should
be conducted to evaluate the role these isolates play in the transfer
of antibiotic resistant determinants. Such studies would be of more
value if carried out in communal settings.
