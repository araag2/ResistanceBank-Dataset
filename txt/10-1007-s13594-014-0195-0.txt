Abstract Staphylococcus aureus is involved in human and animal infections. Because of
mastitis in dairy cows, milk can be contaminated by enterotoxin-producing strains, which
constitutes a food poisoning risk. Animal handlers can be asymptomatic carriers, becoming
an additional source of contamination. This research aims to improve our understanding of
Staphylococcus aureus in small-scale dairy systems in central Mexico. Samples were taken
in 12 dairy farms and included composite milk (from the four teats) and hand swabs from

each farmer. Of 149 presumptive S. aureus isolates, 102 (84 from cows; 18 from farmers)
were accurately identified by molecular methods. The genetic variability of 43 randomly
selected isolates was determined by RAPD-PCR, and of these, 38 were genetically distinct
(≤90% similarity). Of the 38 distinct isolates, 78.9% harboured at least one enterotoxin-
encoding gene (staphylococcal enterotoxin a (sea)–sed, seg, and/or sei), whereas 100%
carried icaA–icaD genes and 28% carried the bap gene. The latter three genes are all
involved in biofilm formation. Susceptibility to antibiotics, bacteriocins, and bacteriophages,
was also assayed; 36.8% of isolates were resistant to penicillin G. Only five isolates were
resistant to bacteriocins nisin A and AS-48, and phiPLA-RODI was the most effective
bacteriophage, infecting all of the isolates. These results support the need to adopt manage-
ment strategies to improve hygiene and milking practices in order to enhance herd health and
diminish the risk of food poisoning associated with the consumption of raw milk cheese.

1 Introduction

Small-scale dairy systems (SSDS) provide an option for improving rural livelihoods and
alleviating poverty (Espinoza-Ortega et al. 2007). In Mexico, over 78% of specialized
dairy farms are small scale, defined by small holdings, with herds of between 3 and 35
cows plus replacements, that rely on family labour, and these systems contributed 37% of
national milk production (Hemme et al. 2007). Milk hygiene is a challenge for these small-
scale dairy systems involving good milking practices and both animal and human health.
Staphylococcus aureus is a coagulase-positive microorganism frequently detected in dairy
farms and considered one of the main causes of sub-clinical and chronic mastitis in dairy
cows (Makovec and Ruegg 2003; Wang et al. 2009), with negative effects in the economics
of milk production. Cattle are one of the primary reservoirs for staphylococci, and an udder
with mastitis is usually the main source of contamination by S. aureus (Waldvogel 2001).
Humans can be asymptomatic carriers and, consequently, a source of contamination too
(Gutiérrez et al. 2012; Rall et al. 2014). Moreover, some strains produce heat-stable entero-
toxins and are responsible for food poisoning (Le Loir et al. 2003). The ability of S. aureus
strains to produce biofilms is suggested as a virulence factor associated to staphylococcal
mastitis and accounts for the establishment of chronic infections as a reduced susceptibility to
antibiotics and disinfectants occurs due to the decreased diffusion of antimicrobials through
the biofilm's matrix (Vasudevan et al. 2003). Therefore, strains bearing biofilm-encoding
genes have an additional, potential pathogenicity that must be taken into account.

Due to the significant impact on animal and human health, it is important to assess the
resistance of S. aureus isolates to antibiotics since antibiotic therapy is the primary means
of combating bacterial infections. However, the detection of multidrug-resistant S. aureus
is increasingly common, and reduced efficacy of antibiotic therapy has become a matter of
concern in veterinary practice (Lee 2003). In this regard, there is a clear need for
alternative approaches to mastitis treatment such as bacteriocins (Cao et al. 2007) and
bacteriophages (Dias et al. 2013). Bacteriocins are bacterial ribosomally synthesized
peptides with antimicrobial activity. Apart from their role as biopreservatives (Deegan
et al. 2006), some bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria have been successfully

Staphylococcus aureus in Mexican small-scale dairy systems

assayed against pathogens causing bovine mastitis (Klostermann et al. 2010).
Bacteriophages, natural enemies of bacteria, have also been tested to combat human
(Duckworth and Gulig 2002) and bovine infections (Gill et al. 2006; Dias et al. 2013).

The present work aimed to evaluate the prevalence of S. aureus in a sample of small-scale
dairy systems located in the highlands of Central Mexico in order to be able to suggest ways
of improving herd health and the microbiological quality of milk since this is used in the
manufacture of raw milk cheeses with the concomitant risk for consumers. Putative
virulence determinants such as enterotoxin-encoding genes and the biofilm-forming ability
of staphylococcal isolates were analyzed. Susceptibility to antibiotics and natural antimicro-
bials such as nisin A (lantibiotic) and AS-48 (circular bacteriocin) and S. aureus-infecting
bacteriophages was approached. Additionally, the genetic variability and relationships
among the isolates were established by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR.

2 Material and methods

2.1 Sampling design

Twelve small-scale dairy farms in the municipality of Aculco in the State of Mexico were
selected from a larger sample of farms participating in a larger project (Fadul-Pacheco
et al. 2013), as representative of farms of this Mexican area. Criteria for selection were all
cows of the same breed (Holstein—being the most prevalent), a minimum of three milking
cows at the time of the study (a maximum of five cows per farm were sampled) and hand
milking. Age and stage of lactation were not considered or recorded. Sampling took place
between November 2012 and January 2013 always during milking. A total of 57
composite milk samples were obtained by mixing milk from the four quarters (one sample
per cow) after the udders had been washed and dried and the teats had been cleaned with
cotton swabs soaked in 70% ethanol. Milk from the first streams was included in the
sample in order to isolate environmental microorganisms that could be present at the
sphincter, as well as those from the mammary gland. Additionally, 12 samples were taken
from the hands of the 12 farmers using a sterile swab and placing it into 3 mL of nutritive
broth. All samples were kept at 4 °C until processing in the laboratory.

2.2 Isolation and identification of S. aureus strains

Serial tenfold dilutions of milk samples were made in Ringer solution (Merck KGaA,
Darmstadt, Germany), and 0.1 mL of each was plated onto Baird–Parker (BP) agar supple-
mented with egg yolk tellurite emulsion (Scharlab, Barcelona, Spain) in order to obtain single
colonies for further characterization. Undiluted hand swabs were also spread onto BP agar.
Each sample was plated in duplicate, and all plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h.

Ten colonies showing the typical aspect of staphylococci were randomly selected
from each plate and spread onto salt-mannitol agar to obtain pure cultures, and these
were tested for coagulase (Bactident Coagulase, Merck), DNase activity (DNase agar,
Cultimed, Panreac, Barcelona, Spain) and mannitol fermentation under anaerobiosis
(Notarnicola et al. 1985). All presumptive S. aureus isolates were further confirmed by
simultaneous PCR amplification of genes encoding for 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
(1,250 bp) (Straub et al. 1999) and thermonuclease (nuc) (450 bp) (Wilson et al. 1991)

T.B. Salgado-Ruiz et al.

(Table 1). Isolates were coded according to their origin (the prefix M for milk and H for
hand swabs). S. aureus Sa9, isolated from mastitis milk (García et al. 2007), and
S. aureus ATCC 14458 were used as positive controls; Staphylococcus epidermidis
F12 was used as a negative control (Delgado et al. 2009). All isolates were routinely
cultured in tryptic soy broth (TSB, Scharlab) or in tryptic soy agar (TSA). Bacterial
stocks were stored at −80 °C in TSB supplemented with 20% v/v glycerol.

2.3 DNA extraction and PCR conditions

A colony from each presumptive S. aureus isolate was added to 20 μL of 0.25% SDS–
50 mM NaOH and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Deionized water was subsequently added
up to a volume of 200 μL. Samples were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at
4 °C, and the supernatant containing the DNA was kept at −20 °C for further analysis.
All PCRs were performed in a thermocycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) using the
Pure Taq Ready-To-Go PCR Beads kit (GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany), 1 μL of the
extracted DNA and the primer concentrations specified in Table 1. The PCR conditions
specified in Table 1 were used, with the exception of those used for the detection of the
23S RNA and the nuc genes, where a multiplex PCR was performed composed of an
initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, 53 °C
for 1 min and 72 °C for 2 min and eventually a final extension step at 72 °C for 7 min.
PCR products were loaded onto 2% agarose gels and electrophoresis carried out for
1 h at 100 V in Tris–acetate–EDTA. The gels were then stained with ethidium bromide
−1) for 30 min and visualized under UV light with a G: Box Syngene™
(0.5 μg.mL
transilluminator (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). DNA ladders of 500 or 100 bp were
included in the gels as molecular weight controls.

2.4 Genomic fingerprinting of S. aureus isolates

The RAPD-PCR method was chosen for the differentiation of the S. aureus isolates.
Primers used for this purpose were OPL5, RAPD5 and P1 (Table 1) according to the
method previously described (Gutiérrez et al. 2011). Strains of S. aureus from the
Instituto de Productos Lácteos de Asturias—Consejo Superior de Investigación
Científica (IPLA-CSIC—Dairy Institute of Asturias, Spain) and S. aureus ATCC
14458 were included to enable the comparison of genetic variability among Mexican
S. aureus and isolates from distant geographical locations.

RAPD-PCR band patterns from each primer were scanned and profile grouping
(dendrogram) performed with the GENTOOLS Syngene™ software (Syngene, Cambridge,
UK), using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and the unweighted pair
group method with arithmetic averages (UPGMA) cluster analysis (Struelens 1996).

2.5 Detection of putative virulence factors

The presence of genes encoding for two virulence factors (enterotoxin and biofilm produc-
tion) in the genome of the staphylococcal isolates was tested. The detection of eight
enterotoxin genes was performed using two multiplex PCRs. The first included the staph-
ylococcal enterotoxin a (sea), seb, sec, sed and see-specific primers, while the second used
primers to detect the seg, seh and sei genes (Table 1). Additionally, assessment of the

capability to form biofilms was performed using two further multiplex PCRs. The first
combined specific primers to detect simultaneously the icaD and biofilm-associated protein
(bap) genes, and the second used only the icaA primer (Table 1).

2.6 Susceptibility to antibiotics

Antibiotic susceptibility of staphylococcal isolates was determined by the disc diffusion
method according to the CLSI (2010). The following discs were provided by Oxoid
(Basingstoke, UK): ciprofloxacin (CIP5), enrofloxacin (ENR5), erythromycin (E15),
oxacillin (OX5), penicillin G (P10), quinupristin–dalfopristin (QD15), rifampicin
(RD5), streptomycin (S10), sulphamethoxazole–trimethoprim (SXT25) and tetracycline
(TE30). They are used as antimicrobial agents for food-producing animals (OIE 2014;
Commission Regulation (EU) No 37/ 2010) and are representative of different classes of
antibiotics. Vancomycin (VA5), which belongs to the glycopeptide class, a critically
important antibiotic used in human medicine, was also tested (CIA 2011). Oxacillin was
included for the detection of putative methicillin-resistant isolates (CLSI 2010). Plates of
Mueller-Hinton agar (Scharlab) seeded with each staphylococcal isolate were incubated
at 37 °C for 24 h and the inhibition zone diameters interpreted according to the CLSI
tables. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of isolates resistant to penicillin G

was determined by using the MIC Evaluator (M.I.C.E.)TM (32–0.002 μg.mL
MA0100D system (Oxoid). S. aureus ATCC 25923 was used as a positive control for
the inhibition halo formation.

2.7 Susceptibility to bacteriocins

The antimicrobial activity of bacteriocins against the staphylococcal isolates was deter-
mined by the agar diffusion test. For this purpose, pure nisin A (kindly supplied by
Applin & Barret Ltd, Dorset, UK) and AS-48 (kindly supplied by Dr. Mercedes
Maqueda, University of Granada, Spain) were used. The concentration of stock solu-
tions for nisin A and AS-48 were 30 and 35 μM, respectively. Twenty millilitres of TSA
(1.2% w/v agar) was inoculated with staphylococcal isolates at ca. 105 colony forming
−1 and pour plated. Wells (4 mm in diameter) were made with a sterile
units (CFU) mL
borer and filled with twofold dilutions of bacteriocin solutions in phosphate-buffered
saline solution. MIC was defined as the lowest concentration that produced a clear
inhibition halo after incubation at 37 °C for 24 h (Martínez et al. 2005). The range of
bacteriocin concentrations assayed was the following: nisin A (30, 15, 7.5, 3.75, 1.875,
0.937 and 0.468 μM) and AS-48 (35, 17.5, 8.75, 4.375, 2.187, 1.093 and 0.547 μM).
S. aureus CECT 4013 was used as positive control for the inhibition halo formation.

2.8 Susceptibility to bacteriophages

The IPLA-CSIC collection bacteriophages vB_SauS-phiIPLA35 (in short, phiIPLA35)
and vB_SauS-phiIPLA88 (in short, phiIPLA88) (García et al. 2007), vB_SauM-
phiIPLA-RODI (in short, phiIPLA-RODI) and vB_SepM-phiIPLA-C1C (in short,
phiIPLA-C1C) (Gutiérrez et al., unpublished data) and phi11 (Iandolo et al. 2002)
were used to determine their ability to lyse the staphylococcal isolates. The suscepti-
bility of isolates to the phages was determined by the spot test. Five microlitres of each

phage (phage titre about 109 PFU.mL
about 106 CFU.mL
for 24 h, the presence of a clear lysis zone is representative of phage susceptibility.

−1) was dropped onto a TSA plate overlaid with
−1 of each isolate (Gutiérrez et al. 2010). After incubation at 37 °C

3 Results

3.1 Isolation and identification of S. aureus

From a total of 149 presumptive S. aureus isolates found in the 12 farms (from
milk to hand swabs), 102 (84 from milk and 18 from hand swab samples) were
identified as S. aureus according to biochemical methods. The positive identification
was confirmed by the detection of specific amplicons corresponding to the 23S rRNA
and nuc genes. The positive isolates were detected in 30 of 57 cows (52.6%) and in 8 of
12 hand swabs (66.6%). S. aureus was not detected in the milk from two of the farms (6
and 12), and four cattle handlers were not S. aureus carriers (farms 4, 10, 11 and 12).

3.2 Genetic variability of S. aureus isolates

The genetic variability of 43 positive isolates (one for each milk sample and one for each
hand swab, randomly selected) was determined by RAPD-PCR genotyping using three
different primers (Table 1). Isolates were grouped into four main clusters (I–IV). With the
exception of cluster II, the others were further divided into eight sub-clusters (Ia, Ib; IIIc, IIId;
IVe, IVf, IVg, IVh) (Fig. 1). Cluster I, with 37% similarity with clusters II, III and IV, is
composed of isolates from four different farms. Cluster II, with 43.5% of similarity with
clusters III and IV, includes two strains with very different origin (M16, a Mexican isolate
and the collection strain ATCC 14458). Of note, cluster III, with 47.05% similarity with
cluster IV, includes six of the eight hand isolates and only one milk isolate from a different
farm (farm 4). Group IV comprises most of isolates (28 from milk and 2 from hand swab
samples) that were grouped into four sub-clusters each belonging to a different farm. Only
one Mexican strain (M31) fell completely outside of the four clusters since it is more closely
related to the Spanish isolate IPLA 18 (52% similarity) than to any of the other Mexican
isolates. The Spanish isolates Sa9 and IPLA 1 are also outside of the clusters due to their low
similarity (32.5 and 38.6%, respectively) with the other isolates.

For discriminating strains, a threshold similarity value of 90% was set, so that
isolates with a similarity above this value were considered clonal and excluded from
further analyses (M2, M8, M9, M11, and M28). Accordingly, the 43 Mexican isolates
included in the dendrogram (Fig. 1) showed 38 different RAPD-PCR profiles (30 from
milk and 8 from hand swabs).

3.3 Putative virulence factors of S. aureus isolates

One isolate representative of each of the 38 different RAPD-PCR profiles was
selected and tested for the presence of enterotoxin and biofilm-encoding genes. The
most widely distributed genes were sea (47.3%), seg (55.2%) and sei (31.5%),
while seb and sec genes were only detected in one unique isolate (M16 and M35,
respectively), and no isolate harboured either seh or see genes (Fig. 2a). Overall,

Fig. 1 Arrows indicate the similarity percentage arbitrarily chosen as a discriminating threshold to define the
homogenous clusters (I–IV). The dashed line represents the threshold similarity value of 90 % for discrim-
inating genetically different strains

30 of 38 isolates (78.9%) harboured between one and five enterotoxin-encoding
genes (sea, seb, sec, sed, seg and sei) with the following distribution: one gene
(eight M and four H isolates), two genes (six M and two H isolates), three genes
(five M and one H isolates), four genes ( one M isolate) and five genes (one M
isolate).

In relation to biofilm production genes, all the isolates tested positive for the icaA and
icaD genes, which are responsible for the formation of an exopolysaccharide biofilm
matrix, whereas the bap gene, responsible for the synthesis of a bacterial surface protein
involved in the formation of a proteinaceous biofilm matrix, was detected in 11 of the 38
isolates (28.9%) belonging to six farms (2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 11). It is worth noting that only
one of the isolates (H7, farm 8) harbouring the bap gene was of human origin (Fig. 2b).

3.4 Antimicrobial susceptibility

3.4.1 Antibiotics

Fourteen of the 38 isolates (36.8%) showed resistance to penicillin G (P10). One of them
(M15) also showed resistance to streptomycin (S10). Resistance to tetracycline (TE30) was
observed in isolate M17, and intermediate resistance to erythromycin (E15) was shown by
the milk isolate M7 (Table 2). The MICs of penicillin-G-resistant isolates ranged from 0.25
−1 regardless of their origin (milk or cattle handler), with clearly higher
to 0.5 μg.mL
resistance than that shown by the control strain S. aureus ATCC 25923 (0.03 μg.mL

−1).

3.4.2 Bacteriocins

The susceptibility of S. aureus isolates to the lantibiotic nisin A and the circular
bacteriocin AS-48 was determined. The MICs of nisin and AS-48 for most of the
strains were 7.5 and 8.75 μM, respectively, suggesting that both bacteriocins displayed
similar antimicrobial potency against these isolates (Table 2). Furthermore, both bac-
teriocins were active against S. aureus strains, regardless of whether they were isolated
from milk or cattle handlers, and both populations showed a similar MIC distribution.
Nevertheless, resistant strains to the highest bacteriocin concentrations were detected.
Of note, the human isolates H1 and H8 were resistant to both bacteriocins. The control
strain S. aureus CECT 4013 showed an MIC of 7.5 μM for nisin as did most of isolates,
but its MIC was clearly higher for AS-48 (35 μM).

3.4.3 Bacteriophages

The susceptibility of S. aureus isolates to bacteriophages from the IPLA-CSIC collec-
tion was assessed (Table 2). All 38 isolates were sensitive to phage vB_SauM-
phiIPLA-RODI but resistant to phage vB_SauM-phiIPLA-C1C. The lytic activity of
phages vB_SauS-phiIPLA88 and phi11 was very similar, showing almost identical host
inhibition spectra (32 and 33 isolates, respectively). Two of the isolates that were
resistant to both phages are of human origin.

All of the isolates showed greater variability in relation to their susceptibility to
phage vB_SauS-phiIPLA35. Fourteen of the isolates (36.8%) were sensitive, but most
of the human isolates (seven of eight) were resistant to this phage.

4 Discussion

The prevalence of S. aureus in small farms in the highlands of Central Mexico was
investigated as this microorganism is a common cause of udder disease in dairy cows
and has implications for human health. Milk samples from 30 of 57 cows (52.6%) and
8 of 12 hand swabs (66.6%) tested positive for S. aureus. The pathogen was detected
neither in milk from two of the farms (6 and 12) nor on hand swabs from four of the
cattle handlers (farms 4, 10, 11 and 12). In comparison, S. aureus prevalence was
substantially lower in milk samples (6.6%) from dairy farms of a similar size in the state
of Sao Paolo, Brazil (Lee et al. 2012).

Forty-three isolates, representative of each positive sample, were subjected to
RAPD-PCR genotyping to define their genetic diversity. The cluster analysis revealed
four different clusters (I–IV), and 38 isolates were identified as genetically distinct
(≤90% similarity). This study revealed a weak relationship between milk and human
isolates, suggesting that transmission of S. aureus from farmers to cows has not yet
occurred on the farms included in this study. By contrast, a study of dairy farms in
Central-Eastern Mexico (Manjarrez-López et al. 2012) reported 79.3% of S. aureus
isolates showing human origin, indicating the importance humans as vectors for
S. aureus transmission. Data supporting animals and humans as sources of S. aureus
zoonotic infections of humans and pathogens infecting livestock have both previously
been reported (Van Cleef et al. 2011; Sakwinska et al. 2011).

RAPD-PCR genotyping showed certain variability among the isolates from milk
samples. Most of them belong to cluster IV and are distributed among four sub-clusters
(IVe–IVh). The three isolates from farm 1, however, are grouped into only one sub-
cluster (IVh). Cluster I harbours isolates from four different farms. A similarity
exceeding 90% was only detected between isolates within farms 1, 2 and 3. By
contrast, human isolates showed lower variability. Six of eight isolates belong to sub-
cluster IIId, with a similarity ranging from 56 to 81%. The remaining isolates (H2 and
H4, sub-cluster IVh), with 87% similarity, are closer to isolates from farm 1 (74%
similarity) than to any of the others. As expected, strains from distant geographical
locations (Sa9, IPLA 1, IPLA 18 and ATCC 14458) showed very low genetic relation-
ship with Mexican isolates, with the exception of isolates M31 and M16.

The presence of enterotoxin-producing and biofilm formation genes in the genome
of S. aureus isolates contribute to their pathogenicity. Most of the 38 distinct isolates
are multi-SE gene carriers (73.7%) and, consequently, potentially enterotoxigenic and
were detected in the ten farms that tested positive for S. aureus. The non-
enterotoxigenic isolates (23.3% from milk samples) are distributed among four farms
(5, 7, 9 and 11). Interestingly, the unique isolate from human origin (H3) that does not
harbour any se genes was detected in a different farm (farm 3). The presence of the sea
gene in most of the milk isolates from farms 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 makes them a potential risk
for consumers, as SEA is the most common enterotoxin in staphylococcal food
poisoning (Pinchuk et al. 2010). The sea gene was also detected in three isolates from

Staphylococcus aureus in Mexican small-scale dairy systems

cattle handlers (farms 7, 8 and 9). Thus, the use of raw milk from the majority of the
farms studied carries a health risk for consumers.

The putative pathogenicity of isolates is increased by their ability to produce
biofilms (Valle et al. 2012). All of the isolates are potential polysaccharide-type biofilm
producers as they carry icaA and icaD genes involved in the biosynthesis of polysac-
charide intracellular adhesion (PIA) (Crampton et al. 1999). Moreover, the bap gene
that is related to the formation of proteinaceous biofilms (Cucarella et al. 2001) was
also detected in ten milk isolates and one human isolate (H7, farm 8). This is
particularly relevant because, so far, this gene had been only associated with the
infection of bovine udders (Cucarella et al. 2004), meanwhile bap-harbouring strains
associated with human infections are coagulase negative Staphylococcus (Arciola et al.
2012). None of the milk isolates from farm 8 is, however, a bap gene carrier.

The susceptibility to antibiotics tests are an important guide for veterinarians to
select the most suitable treatment when udder infection occurs. In this context, the
sensitivity of the isolates to ten antibiotics approved for veterinary use, and to vanco-
mycin, used in human medicine, was determined. Only resistance to penicillin was
particularly relevant, being detected in 33.3% (10/30) of milk isolates (farms 1, 4, 5, 7,
8, 9 and 10) and in half the human isolates (Farms 2, 3, 5 and 7), giving an overall
resistance of 36.8% (14/38). Of those, only one isolate (M15) was also resistant to
streptomycin. The great concern about MRSA strains (Lee 2003) makes it especially
relevant that none of the isolates in the present study was resistant to oxacillin. The
pattern of antibiotic resistance identified in this study suggests that penicillin is the most
frequently used antibiotic to treat mastitis.

Nisin A and AS-48 bacteriocins were chosen as antimicrobial alternatives to antibi-
otic therapy (Cotter et al. 2013) due to their proved activity against S. aureus (Delves-
Broughton et al. 1996; Sánchez-Hidalgo et al. 2011). Most isolates were sensitive to the
bacteriocin concentrations tested. This supports their potential use to fight against the
staphylococcal isolates that colonize the small dairy farms analyzed in this study. Two
isolates from human origin (H1 and H8) showed resistance to 30 μM of nisin A. H8
was also resistant to 35 μM of AS-48. Whether they share the same resistance
mechanism against nisin and AS-48 has not been addressed. However, it is likely that
changes at the surface of H1 and H8 may reduce the initial electrostatic interactions
between bacteriocins and cells and result in cross resistance to both cationic peptides as
previously described (Kaur et al. 2011).

The sensitivity of the staphylococcal isolates was also tested against members of two
phage families: Siphoviridae (phi11, phiIPLA88 and phiIPLA35) and Myoviridae
(phiIPLA-RODI and phiIPLA-C1C). PhiIPLA-RODI was the most effective bacterio-
phage as it was able to infect and lyse all the isolates, regardless of their origin (bovine
or human). Similar results were observed by Dias et al. (2013) since four of ten
bacteriophages isolated from mastitic milks were effective against all the mastitis-
causing S. aureus isolates. Phages phiIPLA88 and phi11 also showed notable
antistaphylococcal effectiveness (84.2 and 86.8% of isolates) with almost identical host
inhibition spectra. This result could be related to the high degree of genome identity
(75.3%) and the notable shared protein content (65%) (García et al. 2009). A small host
inhibition spectrum was shown by phage phiIPLA35, and most of resistant isolates are
grouped in cluster III to which most human isolates belong (only one was sensitive).
However, no human isolates were resistant to phage RODI, whereas two were resistant

T.B. Salgado-Ruiz et al.

to IPLA 88 and phi11. By contrast, phage phiIPLA-C1C was unable to infect any
isolate. This result is in agreement with previous data (Gutiérrez et al., unpublished
data) since this phage is much more active against S. epidermidis than against S. aureus
strains. As a whole, these results support bacteriophages as a promising alternative to
fight against antibiotic-resistant pathogens from human or bovine origin (Duckworth
and Gulig 2002; Dias et al. 2013).

5 Conclusion

Overall, results highlight the need to improve hygiene conditions and milking practices
in the small-scale dairy systems that were the focus of this study since potential
enterotoxigenic and biofilm S. aureus producers are widely distributed in the farms.
There is no evidence of S. aureus transmission between farmers and cattle since RAPD-
PCR profiles of isolates from milk and human origin show low similarity. The
resistance to penicillin G showed by 36.8% of isolates is particularly noteworthy and
points to an antibiotic therapy against udder infection mainly based on penicillin
treatment. Alternative approaches based on bacteriocins and bacteriophages, natural
antimicrobials, have proved to be useful as potential tools to eliminate the pathogen
from cattle and handlers in an environmentally friendly way, with the final aim of
enhancing herd health and diminishing the inherent food poisoning risk associated with
the consumption of cheese made with raw milk produced in these farms.
