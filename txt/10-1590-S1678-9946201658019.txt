SUMMARY

Salmonella spp. causes diseases in fowls, when species-specific serovars (Salmonella Pullorum and S. Gallinarum) are present 
in flocks, and public health problems, when non-typhoid serovars are isolated, as well as possible bacterial resistance induced by 
the preventive and therapeutic use of antimicrobials in animal production. This study describes the serovars and bacterial resistance 
of 280 Salmonella spp. strains isolated from turkey and broiler carcasses in Southern Brazil between 2004 and 2006. Salmonella 
Enteritidis was the most prevalent serovar (55.7%), followed by Heidelberg (5.0%), Agona (4.3%), Bredeney (3.9%), Hadar (3.2%), 
and Typhimurium (2.9%). Tennessee and S. Enterica subspecies enterica (O: 4.5) were isolated only in turkeys, and Hadar (18.6%) 
was the most prevalent serovar in this species. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed in 178 isolates (43 from turkeys and 
135 from broilers). All isolates were sensitive to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, polymyxin B, ciprofloxacin, and norfloxacin, and were 
resistant to bacitracin and penicillin. Broiler carcass isolates showed resistance to nalidixic acid (48.9%), nitrofurantoin (34.3%), 
neomycin (9.6%), tetracycline (5.2%), and kanamycin (8.9%); and turkey carcass isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid (62.8%), 
tetracycline (34.9%), and neomycin (30.2%), with a significant difference in turkeys when compared to broiler carcass isolates. These 
results indicate the need for judicious use of antimicrobials in livestock production, given that the serovars identified are potential 
causes of food poisoning.

INTRODUCTION

Poultry production is one of the major sectors of the agribusiness 
complex in Brazil, which ranks as the largest exporter and the third 
largest producer of chicken meat, and third largest producer and second 
largest  exporter  of  turkey  meat1. The  commercialization  of  poultry 
products  must  meet  sanitary  requirements  so  as  to  guarantee  that 
food of animal origin are free of pathogens such as Salmonella spp. 
Salmonella spp. causes diseases in fowls when species-specific serovars 
(Salmonella Pullorum and Salmonella Gallinarum) infect flocks, and 
public health problems occur when non-typhoid serovars are isolated, 
showing a correlation between poultry products and food poisoning, 
caused  mainly  by  the  Enteritidis, Typhimurium, Agona,  Hadar,  and 
Heidelberg serovars2,3,4,5.

The prevalence of Salmonella spp. in poultry carcasses has decreased 
since  the  implementation  of  programs  such  as  Hazard Analysis  and 
Critical Control Point (HACCP)6, but its occurrence is still common in 
poultry  production7,  which  led  the  Brazilian  Ministry  of Agriculture, 
Livestock and Food Supply to introduce the Pathogen Reduction Program 

(PRP) for poultry carcasses (broilers and turkeys)8. PRP is targeted at 
monitoring carcasses in all slaughterhouses under the Federal Inspection 
Service in Brazil, gathering epidemiological data on the agent and aiding 
future decisions regarding the control of salmonellosis in poultry. 

The  use  of  antimicrobials  for  therapeutic  purposes  or  as  growth 
promoters had led to the isolation of Salmonella strains that are resistant 
to these drugs9,10,11, with implications for public health, as the intake of 
food with antibiotic residues increases bacterial resistance12 and hinders 
or precludes the treatment of intestinal diseases in humans and animals. 

This study reports on the Salmonella serovars identified in broiler 
and turkey carcasses under the PRP in Southern Brazil between 2004 and 
2006, and the antimicrobial resistance profile of these isolates. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The study was conducted at SENAI’s teaching laboratory – Chapecó, 
in  the  State  of  Santa  Catarina,  Brazil,  with  541  Salmonella  samples 
isolated from broiler and turkey carcasses belonging to 18 broiler farms

included  in  the  PRP,  in  the  Southern  region  of  the  country  between 
2004 and 2006. Fifteen random samples were selected from each one 
of the 18 selected slaughterhouses, totaling 270 samples for serological 
identification, at the Osvaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), by means 
of  the  Kauffmann-White  classification  of  serovars,  on  the  basis  of 
serologic  identification  of  O  (somatic)  and  H  (flagellar)  antigens.  Of 
those, 178 (43 from turkeys and 135 from broilers) were submitted to 
antimicrobial susceptibility tests for nalidixic acid (30 μg), ampicillin 
(10 μg), amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (20 and 10 μg), cephalothin (30 μg), 
ceftiofur (30 μg), ciprofloxacin (10 μg), chloramphenicol (30 μg), colistin 
(50  μg),  clotrimoxazole  -  sulfamethoxazole  +  trimethoprim  (25  μg), 
enrofloxacin  (10  μg),  spectinomycin  (100  μg),  streptomycin  (10  μg), 
gentamicin (10 μg), neomycin (30 μg), nitrofurantoin (25 μg), norfloxacin 
(10 μg), penicillin G (10 U.I.), polymyxin B (300 U.I.), sulfonamide 
(300 μg), tetracycline (30 nalμg), aztreonam (30 μg), bacitracin (10 U.I.), 
kanamycin (30 μg), and fosfomycin (25 μg). After 24 hours of incubation 
at a 36 °C ± 1 °C, the clear zones (circles) formed in response to a given 
antibiotic when the isolate is inhibited in vitro by a certain concentration 
of this drug, were assessed and compared with the standard performance 
table for susceptibility tests13. The results were analyzed by the chi-square 
test  of  independence  and/or  by  Fisher’s  exact  test,  and  by  SPSS  for 
Windows version 13.0.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Twenty-five Salmonella serovars were identified among 280 isolates 
from broiler and turkey carcasses (Table 1). S. enteritidis was the most 
prevalent  serovar  in  broiler  carcass  isolates  and  Hadar  was  the  most 
prevalent one in turkeys (Fig. 1). Note that the identified serovars are 
non-typhoid and associated with food poisoning in humans14. 

The Enteritidis serovar was isolated in 14% of samples collected 
from  turkeys,  a  result  that  is  not  in  agreement  with  data  from  other 
studies2. We  did  not  detect  this  serovar  in  turkey  carcasses,  but  only 
Hadar,  Saintpaul,  Indiana,  and  Blockley.  The  Salmonella  enterica 
subspecies enterica (O: 4.5) and Tennessee serovars were isolated only 
from turkey carcasses. Although Hadar (18.6%) was the most prevalent 
serovar in turkeys, it yielded the lowest rate among broiler carcass isolates 
(0.4%). The presence of this serovar in both species may indicate cross-
contamination at the meat packing plant, as both were slaughtered at the 
same location, but on different slaughter lines. On the other hand, the 
fowls might have eaten a diet including vegetable-origin raw materials 
contaminated by these serovars15,16. Salmonella has been found to be a 
source of contamination in soybean bran after detecting 5.45% of samples 
from this raw material as positive.

Of the 25 identified serovars, only 14 were isolated from turkey 
carcasses. The distribution and number of serovars may be attributed 
to  the  smaller  volume  in  turkey  production  compared  to  that  of 
broilers,  causing  less  cross-contamination  and,  consequently,  less 
dissemination of the serovars. This difference between serovars has 
already  been  described  in  an  E.U.  report  indicating  that  Enteritidis 
was prevalent in broilers (11.0%) while Typhimurium was prevalent in 
turkeys. Describing the presence of Salmonella in Canadian turkeys17, 
52 serovars were identified among 2,690 samples (14% Anatum, 12% 
Hadar,  and  10% Agona).  Salmonella  O:  4.5,  Panama,  Rissen,  and 
Enteritidis were not reported in Canada, and Enteritidis is considered 
to be rare in turkeys in that country.

Also in contrast with our findings, 11 serovars (chiefly San Diego 
60%, Ohio 10%, Montevideo 6.7%, and Indiana 5%) were identified in 
turkey carcasses in two slaughterhouses submitted to federal inspection 
in the USA18, but in this study Enteritidis and Hadar were not isolated. 
Another U.S. study detected 15 Salmonella serovars, without mentioning 
their prevalence, but indicated Seftenberg followed by Hadar, Agona, and 
Heidelberg as major serovars19.

In Brazil, there are few reports on Salmonella in turkey carcasses 
because production was restricted to a single company for several years. 
S. Chester was found in turkeys in a clinical case in southern Brazil20. 
Nowadays,  there  are  many  turkey  slaughterhouses  in  Brazil,  which 
explains the PRP rules for this species, that used to be a much underrated 
and under consumed option, but is now included in sanitary and food 
safety programs. 

The occurrence of the Enteritidis serovar in our study amounted to 
55.7% (63.3% in broilers). The serovar Enteritidis was found in 51% of 
broiler carcasses21 and in 60.4% of frozen chicken22.

After  three  decades  of  outbreak  reports  in  humans  attributed  to 
the Enteritidis serovar, and given the technical and sanitary changes in 
Brazilian poultry production, the fact that S. Enteritidis has had high 
rates of isolation is worrisome, especially because a sanitary program 
for the control of grandparent and parent breeding stocks already exists 
(National Program for Poultry Health – PNSA23). The PNSA actively 
monitors flocks for Pullorum, Gallinarum, Enteritidis, and Typhimurium 
serovars, but notifications of positive flocks for Enteritidis are infrequent. 
However, cross-contamination in slaughterhouses may be overlooked 
as contaminated broilers and are the major source of dissemination of 
Salmonella in meat packing plants11. 

The management of salmonellosis is associated with the prophylactic 
and therapeutic use of antimicrobials and thus antimicrobial susceptibility 
tests  are  essential  for  the  design  of  effective  control  programs.  Our 
results indicate that the detected serovars are sensitive to amoxicillin + 
clavulanic acid, polymyxin B, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. Among bird 
species, ceftiofur and chloramphenicol had a broader action on turkey 
isolates, enrofloxacin and fosfomycin showed better effects on broiler 
isolates (Fig. 2).

Resistance to bacitracin and penicillin amounted to 100%. The results 
for bacitracin are in agreement those from other studies24 since in the

having been banned later on and is currently considered to be a non-tariff 
barrier for exporting countries such as Brazil16. The results for penicillin 
resistance are corroborated by reports of 100% resistance of Salmonella 
Weltevreden in chicken and eggs25,26. 

In the specific case of turkey carcass samples, resistance rates showed 
some significant differences from those serovars isolated from broilers. 
Turkey isolates were sensitive to ceftiofur and to chloramphenicol, and 
resistant  to  fosfomycin  and  to  enrofloxacin,  which  was  not  observed 
in  broiler  isolates.  Conflicting  results  were  described2  after  assessing 
samples isolated from broilers and turkeys, in which enrofloxacin yielded 
50% of resistance in broiler isolates.

The comparison of resistance profiles for the years 2004 to 2006 
showed a significant difference only for nalidixic acid (p = 0.029). In 
Southern Brazil, enrofloxacin is frequently used in poultry production, 
due to its low cost and efficiency against enteritis, which explains the 
increase  in  resistance  of  Salmonella  to  nalidixic  acid7,  especially  in 
turkey isolates. Other authors19 reported 70% of bacterial resistance to 
sulfamethoxazole and 65% to tetracycline in two turkey slaughterhouses 
in  the  USA,  unlike  our  findings,  according  to  which  there  was  more 
frequent resistance to nalidixic acid (62.8%). 

The samples isolated during the PRP provided essential data on 
the occurrence of Salmonella spp. in broiler and turkey carcasses in 
Southern  Brazil,  whereas  the  identification  of  non-typhoid  serovar 
demonstrates the potential of this pathogen as a causative agent of food 
poisoning, as well as an important trade barrier to exports. Antimicrobial 
results indicated the need for judicious use of antimicrobials in animal 
production, as resistance to these drugs is a potential threat to public 
and animal health.
