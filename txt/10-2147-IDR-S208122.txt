Objective: This retrospective study was conducted to determine the prevalence and mole-
cular epidemiology characteristics of carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli (CRE).
Methods: A total of 593 Escherichia coli (E. coli) isolates were recovered from pigs and
urban river from 2009 to 2014 in Heilongjiang Province of China. Forty CRE including 22
strains isolated from fecal samples of pigs and 18 strains isolated from water samples were
selected. PCR detection of resistance determinants, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST),
pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and phylogenetic groups were performed to char-
acterize CRE isolates. Conjugation experiments, plasmid stability testing, PCR-based repli-
con typing (PBRT), and PCR mapping were conducted to analyze blaNDM-carrying plasmids.
In vitro time–growth studies and competition experiments were carried out to assess the
ﬁtness impact of NDM carriage.
Results: Five NDM-1-positive E. coli isolates were identiﬁed from water samples. Genetic
environment analysis revealed that a cluster of genes (ISAba125-blaNDM-1-bleMBL-ΔtrpF)
was detected in all of the NDM-1-positive isolates. Conjugation assays showed that blaNDM-1
could be successfully transferred to E. coli J53 from 5 donor strains at frequencies of
4.6×10−5 to 2.6×10−2. The plasmids from all transconjugants belonged to different plasmid
replicon types including IncA/C (n=2), IncFII (n=1) and IncX3 (n=2). In vitro time–growth
studies revealed that blaNDM-1 did not have a signiﬁcant
impact on cell proliferation.
Meanwhile, competition experiments showed that the acquisition of blaNDM-1 can place an
energy burden on the bacterial host and incur ﬁtness cost. However, plasmid stability testing
showed that blaNDM-1-carrying plasmid remained stable in the hosts after seven passages
without antimicrobial selection.
Conclusion: The study revealed the early molecular epidemiology and dissemination
characteristics of CRE. In addition, the overall antimicrobial resistance in E. coli recovered
from water samples is higher than the strains isolated from fecal samples of pigs.
Furthermore, we isolated and identiﬁed ﬁve NDM-1-producing E. coli strains from water
samples.

Introduction
The rapid emergence and dissemination of multiple antimicrobial-resistant (MDR)
bacteria have posed a signiﬁcant threat to global public health, which is commonly
acknowledged to be caused by the indiscriminate, widespread and increasing use of
antibiotics.1,2 The rising patient mortality and morbidity caused by MDR bacterial
infections, and the growing antibiotic resistance even pose a challenge to the vast

medical advancements made by antibiotics. Moreover, due
to the dearth of novel classes of antibiotics entering the
clinic, the phenomenon has been exacerbated over the past
40 years.1

The appearance of MDR bacteria from animals is a
growing area of concern due to the potential possibility for
transfer of resistant pathogens and commensal bacteria to
the human population.3 Many studies demonstrated that
the use of antibiotics can not only increase the level of
resistance of pathogenic bacteria but also increase the level
of resistance of commensal bacteria. Thus, the commensal
bacteria are regarded as a reservoir of resistance genes for
potential pathogenic bacteria. Some resistant commensal
bacteria from food animals, such as zoonotic bacteria can
reach the intestinal tract of humans through the contami-
nated meat, milk, or eggs.3 E. coli is the most prevalent
commensal bacteria in the intestinal tract of animals and
humans, and many studies had shown that the animal and
human infectious diseases may be also implicated with E.
coli.4 Therefore, the level of resistance of E. coli is usually
recognized as a good indicator for monitoring selection
pressure by antibiotic use, prevalence of resistance, and for
detecting the transfer of resistant bacteria or resistance
genes from animals to humans and vice versa.3

Carbapenems, a kind of β-lactams that have long
served as reliable and potent agents against Gram-negative
bacteria, and have been regarded as the last line for treat-
ment of infections caused by MDR bacteria in clinics.5
Due to the proliferation of MDR bacterial pathogens, the
use of carbapenems such as imipenem, ertapenem, and
meropenem in clinics has become more usually during
the past two decades. Due to the increasing consumption
of carbapenem, the carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative
pathogens have been isolated worldwide.6 A common
mechanism mediating carbapenem resistance in Gram-
negative bacteria is the presence of carbapenemases, and
many studies have reported various types of carbapene-
mases, among which Class A (blaKPC), Class B (blaNDM,
blaVIM, blaIMP), and Class D (blaOXA-48) types are the
most common in Enterobacteriaceae.7

Most of the genetic determinants for carbapenemases
are commonly located on mobile genetic elements, such as
plasmid, which make it feasible to transfer among various
species of bacterial pathogens. The worldwide continuous
emergence of carbapenemases in recent years has posed an
increasing threat to the effectiveness of carbapenem. As an
emerging carbapenemase, New Delhi metallo-lactamase
(NDM) was identiﬁed in a broad-spectrum antibiotic-

resistant strain of Klebsiella pneumonia isolated from a
Swedish patient with a hospitalization history in India,
which can mediate resistance to all β-lactams except for
monobactams, and has been considered to have great
potential to cause global health crisis.8

Since 2009, the cases of MDR bacteria harboring blaNDM
have been reported in almost all continents except
Antarctica.9 In China, since the ﬁrst report of blaNDM in
Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, with an increasing number
of Enterobacteriaceae have been identiﬁed as carriers of the
blaNDM.10 Though the prevalence of MDR bacteria harbor-
ing blaNDM is low, numerous cases of clinical infection
caused by NDM-producing isolates have been reported in
several regions of China, which suggests the high transfer-
ability of the blaNDM and the severity of infections caused by
NDM producer.11 Worryingly, many reports regarding the
detection and occurrence of blaNDM in some environmental
compartments, containing hospital sewage, municipal waste-
water, seepage, and tap water, indicate the risk that NDM-
positive strains could widely disseminate the NDM-1 gene
from medical origins.2,12

In the present study, we examined the susceptibility of
E. coli isolates recovered from fecal samples of pigs and
water samples in the Heilongjiang province during 2009–
2014. Additionally,
characteristics of
CREwere evaluated. Overall, our results demonstrated
that
the retrospective study on CRE was necessary to
gain a better understanding of their molecular epidemiol-
ogy characteristics and the rule of dissemination.

Bacterial isolates and antimicrobial
susceptibility testing
This retrospective study was conducted to examine the
prevalence and molecular epidemiology characteristics of
CRE isolates. From June 2009 to July 2014, a total of 593
E. coli including 488 isolates collected from 21 porcine
farms in Heilongjiang Province of China, and 105 E. coli
were recovered from water samples of an urban river in
the city of Harbin, China from 2013 to 2014.

The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 22
antimicrobial agents were determined by the broth microdilu-
tion method following Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) guidelines. The results for various β-lactams,
aminoglycosides, carbapenems, ﬂuoroquinolones, and tetra-
cyclines were interpreted according to CLSI guidelines; colis-
tin and tigecycline were interpreted following European

(EUCAST) guidelines. E. coli strain ATCC 25922 was used
as a quality control strain. The CRE isolates were screened for
carbapenemase using the modiﬁed Hodge test (MHT). In
addition, metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) production was detected
by double-disk synergy tests (DDST), which were performed
using the imipenem–EDTA as previously described.13

Molecular detection of resistance genes
Total DNA was extracted from all CRE isolates by the kit
following the manufacturer's instruction. Carbapenemase
genes (blaBIC, blaKPC, blaIMP, blaVIM, blaNDM, blaGIM,
blaSPM, blaSIM, blaAIM, blaDIM, and blaOXA-48),14 extended
spectrumβ-lactamase genes (blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M, and
blaOXA), plasmid-mediated AmpC genes (blaMOX, blaCMY,
blaDHA, blaACC, blaEBC, and blaFOX),15 16S rRNA methyl-
transferases (armA, rmtA, rmtB, rmtC, rmtD, rmtE, and
npmA),16 and quinolone resistance (qnrA, qnrB, qnrC,
qnrD, qnrS, qepA, oqxAB, and aac(6′)-Ibcr) were examined
by PCR.17 E. coli ATCC25922 was used for the quality
control. Positive ampliﬁcations were subjected to Sangon
sequencing (Sangon Company, Shanghai, China).

PFGE and MLST
Molecular typing of CRE isolates was performed by PFGE.
Genomic DNA of the CRE was prepared in agarose blocks
and was digested with restriction enzyme XbaI (TaKaRa
Biotechnology, Dalian, China). DNA fragments were sepa-
rated using a CHEF II D-Mapper XA PFGE system (Bio-
Rad, Hercules, CA) with running conditions as described
previously.18 MLST of CRE was conducted by PCR as
previously described.19 The allelic proﬁles and sequence
types were identiﬁed by amplifying and sequencing the
seven housekeeping genes (adk, fumC, gyrB, icd, mdh,
purA, recA) according to the reference website (https://enter
obase.warwick.ac.uk/species/index/ecoli). The phylogenetic
groups of CRE were determined by multiplex PCR
analysis.20

method.
Incompatibility groups of plasmids extracted
from transconjugants were determined by PCR-based repli-
con typing as described previously.21,22 The transfer fre-
quency of carbapenem resistance was determined as
described in a previous report.23 Plasmid stability was
assessed in daily serial passages of culture without antibio-
tic and the culture daily analyzed for carbapenem resistance
and conﬁrmed the presence of blaNDM-1 by PCR.24

PCR mapping and sequencing were applied to analyze
the blaNDM-1 genetic structure. The plasmid of pNDM-
BJ01 (accession no. JQ001791) from Acinetobacter lwofﬁi
and E. coli plasmid of pBJ01 (GenBank accession no.
JX296013) were used as the references. The primers
were used in this study as described previously.25

Cloning of blaNDM-1
To study the acquisition of plasmid with blaNDM-1 may
have several effects on bacterial ﬁtness. The blaNDM-1 with
native promoter (NP) was ampliﬁed by PCR using primers
NP-NDM-F (5′-CGGGATCCCACCTCATGTTTGAATTC
GC-3′) and NP-NDM-R (5′-CCCAAGCTTCTCTGTCAC
ATCGAAATCGC-3′), then cloned into the pMD18-T vec-
tor. The resulting plasmids were named pMD18-T/NP-
NDM-1, which were transformed into E. coli DH5α by
electrotransformation and conﬁrmed by PCR and DNA
sequencing, subsequently.

In vitro time–growth studies
The bacterial strains pMD18-T/DH5α and pMD18-T/NP-
NDM-1/DH5α were grown in LB and LB containing 4 μg/
mL imipenem at 37°C and 200 rpm overnight, respectively.
The bacterial suspension was then diluted based on absorbance
at 600 nm and transferred to ﬂasks containing 10 mL LB. The
ﬁnal concentration of inoculum was approximately 1×105
CFU/mL. The bacterial strains with LB were incubated at
37°C and 200 rpm for 12 hrs. Serial samples (at 30 mins, 1,
1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 hrs) were
obtained in triplicate, and bacteria growth was monitored by
measuring the OD600.

Conjugation assay and genetic
environment analysis of the blaNDM-1 gene
The NDM-positive isolates were selected for conjugation
experiment which was implemented by mix broth mating.5
Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-
PCR was used to further distinguish transconjugants from
the donor strains. Antimicrobial susceptibility of transcon-
jugants were determined using the broth microdilution

In vitro growth competition experiments
In vitro competition experiments between pMD18-T/
DH5α and pMD18-T/NP-NDM-1/DH5α were performed
as described previously.24 Exponentially growing cells of
the corresponding pMD18-T/DH5α and pMD18-T/NP-
NDM-1/DH5α were adjusted to a 1.0 McFarland standard,
diluted 1:104 and then mixed in LB with a 1:1 ratio (time
point zero). The mixture was inoculated into ﬂasks

containing 10 mL LB and grown at 37°C and 180 rpm for
24 hrs. Serial 10-fold dilutions were plated in duplicate
onto LBA alone and LBA with 4 μg/mL imipenem in order
to determine the total colony forming unit (CFU) and the
CFU of the mutant at 0 and 24 hrs, respectively. The
number of CFU growing on antibiotic-supplemented
LBA was subtracted from the number of CFU growing
on antibiotic-free LBA to determine the number of suscep-
tible cells in the mixed population. The relative ﬁtness is
calculated using the ratio of the growth rate of the resistant
cells to that of the susceptible.

In vitro time–kill studies
For the in vitro time–kill assay, ﬁve NDM-positive E. coli
isolated from water samples were used as representative
strains, E.coil ATCC25922 were chosen as control strain.
The initial inoculum of 106 CFU/mL was incubated in
antibiotic-supplemented imipenem at a concentration of 4
μg/mL and antibiotic-free MH broth, respectively. In addi-
tion, 100 μL of co-culture were collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6,
8, 12, and 24 hrs post-inoculation for bacterial counts. The
100 μL of co-culture were serially diluted with 0.9 mL
MH broth and plated onto MH agar plates then incubated
at 37°C for 18–24 hrs. The CFU/mL was determined, and
counts were performed in duplicate.

Statistical analysis
Frequency of antimicrobial resistance proﬁles between
E. coli recovered from fecal samples of pigs and E. coli
isolated from water samples was compared using the
Pearson Chi-square test with the software SPSS 17.0,
values of P<0.05 were considered signiﬁcant, and values
of P<0.01 were considered markedly signiﬁcant.

imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, and colistin displaying
low resistance rates (11.4–22.9%). E. coli isolated from
fecal samples of pigs showed high resistance rates (63.5–
96.7%) to gentamicin, ciproﬂoxacin, enroﬂoxacin, doxycy-
cline, chloramphenicol, amoxicillin, and sulfamethoxazole/
trimethoprim; moderate resistance rates (25.4–45.9%) to
amikacin, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, aztreonam, cefotaxime,
ceftiofur, ceftriaxone, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid; and
also showed low rates of resistance (1.2–2.1%) to imipe-
nem, meropenem, ertapenem,
tigecycline, and colistin.
Moreover, among all E. coli, isolates from pigs showed
signiﬁcantly higher resistance to ﬂorfenicol, enroﬂoxacin,
and ciproﬂoxacin (P<0.01), while isolates from water sam-
ples showed higher resistance to the rest of the tested anti-

Antimicrobial susceptible patterns of CRE
A total of 40 (6.74%, 40/593) non-duplicate E. coli isolates
including 22 strains isolated from fecal samples of pigs and 18
strains isolated from water samples, which exhibited resis-
tance to imipenem, ertapenem, or meropenem were selected.
All CRE isolates were resistant to amoxicillin but remained
susceptible to tigecycline, the resistance rate to colistin is only
10%. High resistance rates (>80%) were discovered among 40
CRE isolates for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftiofur, cef-
triaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, tetracycline,
chloramphenicol, ﬂorfenicol, and sulfamethoxazole/trimetho-

Presence of additional antibiotic
resistance genes in CRE
The frequency of the presence of additional antibiotic resis-
tance genes in CRE isolates is shown in Figure 2. Overall,
ESBL genes including blaCTX-M, blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaOXA
were identiﬁed in 38, 25, 9, and 12 isolates, respectively.
blaCTX-M was the most common ESBL gene in this study
including blaCTX-M-3 (n=4), blaCTX-M-15 (n=12), blaCTX-M-55
(n=8), blaCTX-M-64 (n=2), blaCTX-M-14 (n=13), blaCTX-M-27
(n=2), blaCTX-M-65 (n=4), and blaCTX-M-125 (n=1). All blaOXA
positive
(n=9).
Moreover, blaTEM-1 (n=21), blaTEM-52 (n=4), blaSHV-11
(n=2), and blaSHV-12 (n=7) were identiﬁed. Only blaCMY-2
(n=7) and blaCMY-30 (n=4) of AmpC gene were detected in 11
strains. The plasmid-encoded 16S rRNA methylases armA
(n=9) and rmtB (n=7) were detected in 16 isolates. The
plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes oqxAB, qnrS,
aac(6ʹ)-Ib-cr, and qepA were detected in 22, 16, 15 and 9
isolates, respectively.

isolates were identiﬁed as blaOXA-1

Molecular typing of CRE
PFGE and MLST for 40 CRE isolates were performed.
Among 40 CRE isolates, 4 strains were untypable and the
rest of 36 strains exhibited 19 different clusters as A~S

clone type. The MLST analysis identiﬁed 23 different
sequence types (STs) among 40 CRE isolates. The most
commonly identiﬁed genotypes were ST131 and ST648
(n=5), followed by ST38 and ST72 (n=3), whereas the
isolates belonging to ST4 (n=2), ST34 (n=2), ST43
(n=2), ST48 (n=2), ST167 (n=2), ST410 (n=2), ST10,
ST23, ST315, ST405, ST25, ST69, ST169, ST251,
ST252, ST745, ST1209, ST1454, and ST2324 were also
identiﬁed. The NDM-1-producing E. coli isolates were
divided into four STs, as ST72, ST131, ST167 (n=2),
and ST410. The results of phylogenetic group for CRE
revealed that 24 isolates were assigned to low virulence A
type and B1 type, and the other 16 isolates were assigned
to high virulence B2 and D type. Four NDM-1-producing
CRE were divided to low virulence type, and only one
belonged to high virulence type. (as shown in Figure 2)

Transfer of carbapenem resistance
All of the plasmids harboring blaNDM gene from 5 selected
CRE isolates were successfully transferred to E. coli J53
through conjugation at a frequency of 4.6×10−5
to
2.6×10−2. As shown in Table 3, all of the transconjugants
exhibited multidrug resistance phenotypes which are simi-
lar to those of the donor strains, and the susceptibility to
the tested carbapenems reduced. PCR assays conﬁrmed

that blaNDM-1 was successfully transferred to E. coli J53
from CRE isolates along with other resistance genes, such
as blaTEM-1, armA, and rmtB. The plasmids from all
transconjugants belonged to different plasmid replicon
types including IncA/C (n=2), IncFII (n=1), and IncX3
(n=2). The results of plasmid stability testing showed
that the ratio of CFU growing on antibiotic-supplemented
LBA to CFU on antibiotic-free LBA was not statistically
signiﬁcant (P>0.05) after seven passages.

Genetic environments of blaNDM-1
PCR mapping was performed to identify the genetic
environment surrounding the blaNDM-1 gene in all of
the ﬁve NDM-1-producing isolates. Sequence analysis of
PCR products revealed that a cluster of genes (ISAba125-
blaNDM-1-bleMBL-ΔtrpF) was detected in all of the ﬁve
NDM-positive isolates. Two of the isolates contained a com-
mon genomic structure around the blaNDM-1 (ISAba125-
blaNDM-1-bleMBL-ΔtrpF-groES-groL-insE-ISAba125), which

was similar to the genetic environment of the Acinetobacter
lwofﬁi.

In vitro growth curves
To determine the effects of blaNDM-1 on the E. coli growth,
growth curve experiments were conducted to assess the
growth rates under noncompetitive conditions. As shown in
Figure 3, the results showed that the curve patterns and
growth rate of pMD18-T/DH5α and pMD18-T/NP-NDM-
1/DH5α were almost similar. Additionally, it was found that
the time to reach non-exponential growth was also similar.

In vitro competition experiments
In antibiotic-free environment, pMD18-T/NP-NDM-1/
DH5α competed with pMD18-T/DH5α. As shown in
Figure 4,
the pMD18-T/NP-
NDM-1/DH5α
from
E. coli (MJ2, MI19, MJ22, MJ26, and MJ90) showed a
relative ﬁtness of 0.89±0.06, 0.88±0.07, 0.91±0.06, 0.86

the results showed that

±0.06, and 0.84±0.06 at 95% conﬁdence intervals,
respectively.

In vitro time–kill studies
As presented in Figure 5, the difference of growth curve
patterns for all strains was not obvious in antibiotic-free
MH broth, imipenem could hardly inhibit the growth of
CRE isolates, but imipenem at 4 μg/mL could obviously
inhibit the growth of control strain.

Discussion
Numerous retrospective and prospective studies revealed that
the frequent use of antimicrobials as therapy and prophylaxis
of infectious diseases or feed additives in animals could
select high antimicrobial resistance in bacteria, which is
becoming a serious issue in China.26 In the present study,
all E. coli isolates including 488 E. coli strains isolated from
fecal samples of pigs and 105 E. coli isolated from water
samples were tested for their susceptibility to 22 antimicro-
bial agents. The antimicrobial susceptibility test showed that
most of the E. coli were multidrug resistant. Agreeing with
previous studies,27 the isolates showed high resistance to
most of the conventional antimicrobial agents, such as
gentamicin,
tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and trimetho-
prim-sulfamethoxazole which are commonly used for the
treatment of post-weaning diarrhea in pig farm.

Overall, as shown in Table S2, the prevalence of CRE
in river water isolates was higher than that in pig isolates
(17.14% vs 4.51%). The prevalence of CRE was continu-
ally increased in E. coli isolates of pig origins during the
period of investigation (2009–2014), which increased from
1.61% during 2009–2010 to 7.73% during 2013–2014 (as
shown in Figure S1). The E. coli isolates from different
regions have different prevalence of CRE, as Yichun
(6.82%), Jiamusi (8.89%), Mudanjiang (4.26%), Harbin
(5.38%),
(3.70%).
Speciﬁcally, the prevalence of CRE in isolates of swine
origin from Hegan and Jixi was (0/89) (Table S2).

The remarkable ﬁnding in the present study was that
there were signiﬁcant difference between strains isolated
from fecal samples of pigs and water samples on resis-
tance rates to antimicrobial agents. Comparing the fre-
quency of resistance to these 22 antimicrobial agents,
higher resistance rates to most of the tested antimicrobial
agents were present in E. coli strains isolated from water
samples than isolates originated from pigs. It was note-
worthy that our study revealed that 22.9% and 27.6% of
the strains recovered from water samples were resistant to

In the present study, we isolated and identiﬁed 5 bla-
NDM-carrying strains which were all isolated from water
samples among 40 CRE, and we also detected 5 blaKPC-
carrying strains including 3 strains isolated from water
samples and 2 strains isolated from fecal samples of
pigs, other carbapenemase genes were not detected in all
of the CRE isolates. However, a meta surveillance per-
formed in European countries demonstrated 71% of the
CRE were carbapenemase-producing, together with a wide
variety of carbapenemases were detected, which is contra-
dicted with the ﬁndings of this work.30 Generally, the
emergence and dissemination of the blaNDM have continu-
ously increased worldwide. Furthermore, a multicenter
study of the China CRE network showed that 74.4%
were NDM producer among 39 CRE isolates, indicating
that combating infections caused by this “superbug” is
becoming a serious issue.31

The genetic environments surrounding the blaNDM-1 gene
were determined to be ISAba125- blaNDM-1-bleMBL-ΔtrpF in
all of the NDM-positive isolates. The gene cluster (blaNDM-1-
bleMBL-ΔtrpF) has been reported in E. coli plasmids (pNDM-
HK, pBJ01, and pNDM_Dok01) and Acinetobacter lwofﬁi
plasmids (pNDM-BJ01 and pNDM-BJ02), which was highly
conserved.32 Some study demonstrated that blaNDM-1 and ble-
MBL were under the control of the same promoter, and this
structure may facilitate the spread of blaNDM-1 under the anti-
biotics selective pressure.33 It has been showed that ISAba125
could provide the 35 regions of the promoter sequence for
blaNDM-1 in all reported cases.32 Two of the isolates contained
a common genomic structure around the blaNDM-1 (ISAba125-

It is now commonly accepted that the main risk factors
for the rapid increase in the prevalence of CRE are the

elements
Numerous studies showed that the blaNDM-1-like genes
are predominantly detected in the ST131 and ST101 of
E. coli, and ST11 of Klebsiella pneumonia, which sug-
gested that the transmission of mobile resistance elements
in CRE was associated with the sequence types of bacter-
ial strains.35,36 In this study, four STs (ST131, ST167,
ST410, and ST72) were identiﬁed among the ﬁve NDM-
1-positive E. coli isolates. Two E. coli isolates (MJ22 and
MJ26) recovered from two different locations of the river
share the same ST (ST167), suggesting that they were
clonally related. It has been demonstrated that ST131
was the most prevalent strain type of E. coli worldwide,
ST167 has strong association with clinical infections in
China.37 Recently, some studies have reported several
sporadic cases of clinical infections caused by NDM pro-
ducers which were related to E. coli ST167 carrying
blaNDM-5 in various parts of China.37

The high efﬁciency of mobile resistance elements
transfer facilitates the spread of blaNDM worldwide. In
this study, conjugative assays revealed that all of the
blaNDM-1 plasmids were successfully transferred to E.
coli J53 from the 5 donors by conjugation. Furthermore,
the plasmids from all transconjugants belonged to different
plasmid replicon types including IncA/C (n=2), IncFII
(n=1), and IncX3 (n=2). It has been demonstrated that
the widespread blaNDM-1-carrying plasmid throughout the
world was related to multiple replicon types, including
IncX3, IncF, and IncA/C, etc. IncA/C belongs to broad-
host range plasmid, which was predominantly reported for
carrying blaNDM-1 as well as other resistance genes, and
widely disseminated among Gram-negative bacteria
worldwide.38 The identiﬁcation of the IncX3-type plasmid
carrying the blaNDM-1 gene was ﬁrst reported in 2012 in
multiple cities in China.39 Recently, numerous studies
showed that IncX3 plasmids carrying different blaNDM
variants were frequently found among clinical isolates,
indicating that it is an important vector to facilitate the
widespread of NDM in China.39

The impact of blaNDM-1 on growth and ﬁtness was
assessed by comparing pMD18-T/DH5α and pMD18-T/
NP-NDM-1/DH5α. No difference in growth between
pMD18-T/DH5α and pMD18-T/NP-NDM-1/DH5α could
be observed after 12 hrs, indicating that NDM-1 does not
have a signiﬁcant impact on cell proliferation, which is in
line with the previous study.40 The results of competition
experiments demonstrated that the expression of blaNDM-1
could bring energy burden on the host and cause ﬁtness
cost, which is in agreement with the previous study that
acquisition of blaNDM-1 plasmid could lead to a loss of
ﬁtness for E. coli J53 receipt.40

Conclusion
In summary, the overall antimicrobial resistance in E. coli
recovered from water samples is higher than the strains
isolated from fecal samples of pigs. Genes encoding ﬁve

Furthermore, we isolated and identiﬁed ﬁve NDM-1-pro-
ducing E. coli strains isolated from water samples. All of
the plasmids harboring blaNDM-1 from ﬁve selected CRE
isolates were successfully transferred to E. coli J53. The
plasmids from all transconjugants belonged to different
plasmid replicon types including IncA/C, IncFII, and
IncX3. The carriage of blaNDM-1 did not have a signiﬁcant
impact on cell proliferation but reduced ﬁtness of bacterial
hosts. Therefore, studies on early epidemic characteristics
of NDM-positive E. coli are necessary to provide compre-
hensive, extensive, and clear information to optimize anti-
biotic policy in endemic areas.
