The dissemination of plasmid-mediated antimicrobial resistance genes may pose a substantial public health risk. In 
the present work, the occurrences of blaCTX-M and plasmid-mediated ampC and qnr genes were investigated in Escheri-
chia coli from 16 chicken carcasses produced by four commercial brands in Brazil. Of the brands tested, three were 
exporters, including one of organic chicken. Our study assessed 136 E. coli isolates that were grouped into 77 distinct 
biotypes defined by their origin, resistance profiling, the presence of β-lactamase and plasmid-mediated quinolone 
resistance genes and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polimerase chain reaction typing. The blaCTX-M-15, 
blaCTX-M-2 and blaCTX-M-8 genes were detected in one, 17 and eight different biotypes, respectively (45 isolates). Twenty-
one biotypes (46 isolates) harboured blaCMY-2. Additionally, blaCMY-2 was identified in isolates that also carried either 
blaCTX-M-2 or blaCTX-M-8. The qnrB and/or qnrS genes occurred in isolates carrying each of the four types of β-lactamase 
determinants detected and also in oxyimino-cephalosporin-susceptible strains. Plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum 
β-lactamase (ESBL) and AmpC determinants were identified in carcasses from the four brands tested. Notably, this is 
the first description of blaCTX-M-15 genes in meat or food-producing animals from South America. The blaCTX-M-8, blaCTX-
M-15 and blaCMY-2 genes were transferable in conjugation experiments. The findings of the present study indicate that 
plasmid-mediated ESBL and AmpC-encoding genes are widely distributed in Brazilian chicken meat.

Key words: ESBL - plasmid AmpC - qnr - chicken meat - Escherichia coli

Extended-spectrum  β-lactamase  (ESBL)-producing 
Enterobacteriaceae  are  becoming  increasingly  prevalent 
in community-associated infections (Ben-Ami et al. 2009). 
A potential role for chicken meat as a source of multidrug-
resistant  (MDR)  bacteria  carrying  ESBL  and  plasmid-
mediated AmpC (pAmpC) determinants in the population 
has been demonstrated (Bergenholtz et al. 2009, Dhanji et 
al. 2010, Doi et al. 2010, Kola et al. 2012). Indeed, different 
studies have supported the hypothesis that bacterial patho-
gens, including resistant isolates, can be transmitted from 
chicken meat to humans (Thorsteinsdottir et al. 2010, Vin-
cent et al. 2010, Overdevest et al. 2011).

Brazil is one of the world’s most important produc-
ers and the leading exporter of chicken meat, with mar-
kets in different countries of Europe, Asia and the Middle 
East (USITC 2012). Despite this widespread distribution, 
most studies describing Escherichia coli isolates carrying 
CTX-M-  and  CMY-encoding  genes  in  retail  meat  were 
performed  with  chicken  produced  in  Europe  and  Asia 
(Ewers  et  al.  2012,  Kola  et  al.  2012,  Stuart  et  al.  2012,

Xu  et  al.  2014).  Reports  investigating  the  presence  of 
β-lactamase determinants in E. coli from Brazilian chick-
en are scant and are concentrated on samples imported by 
Denmark and the United Kingdom (Warren et al. 2008, 
Bergenholtz et al. 2009, Dhanji et al. 2010). Moreover, the 
occurrence of blaCTX-M-2 on the chromosome of E. coli iso-
lates was recently demonstrated in chicken produced by 
two Brazilian farms (Ferreira et al. 2014).

In  the  present  study,  we  presented  evidence  for 
the  contamination  of  Brazilian  chicken  carcasses  with 
CTX-M and pAmpC-producing E. coli. We investigated 
several brands, including exporters and regional and or-
ganic producers. E. coli isolates were categorised by an-
timicrobial resistance, the presence of β-lactamase and 
qnr  plasmid-mediated  quinolone  resistance  genes  and 
phylogenetic background. The conjugative transfer po-
tentials of the β-lactamase genes were also determined.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample  collection  -  Between  August  2010-April 
2011,  16  frozen  chicken  carcasses  were  obtained  from 
four Brazilian producers (I, II, III and IV, four carcasses 
each) at retail markets in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Produc-
ers  I,  II  and  III  sell  conventional  chicken  and  brand  I 
and  II  products  are  distributed  in  Brazil  and  interna-
tionally.  Producer  III  distributes  chicken  only  in  Bra-
zil; however, carcasses sold as “premium export grade” 
were selected for the study. Producer IV has the same 
commercial  characteristics  of  I  and  II,  but  specialises 
in organic chicken. Whole frozen chicken carcasses in

original packages were chosen as the sample source to 
avoid the risk of additional contamination after leaving 
the processing plant.

Recovery of E. coli isolates - Each carcass was left to 
defrost at 4-8ºC for 36 h and subsequently rinsed with 300 
mL of sterile buffered peptone water (Difco, EUA). Four 
100-µL aliquots of the obtained rinsate were directly in-
oculated onto MacConkey agar (Difco) plates, including 
one untreated plate and three plates each supplemented 
with one of the following antimicrobial agents: ampicil-
lin (8 mg/L), cefotaxime (2 mg/L) or sulfamethoxazole 
(500  mg/L).  Additional  300-µL  aliquots  of  the  rinsate 
were  pre-incubated  in  MacConkey  broth  without  anti-
microbial selection pressure in quadruplicate (Difco) in 
1:10 dilutions for 4 h. Four 100-µL aliquots of each of 
the pre-incubated cultures were inoculated onto the agar 
plates without antimicrobials or with ampicillin (8 mg/L), 
cefotaxime (2 mg/L) or sulfamethoxazole (500 mg/L), to-
talling 16 additional plates. Up to five colonies were se-
lected from each plate, with a priority on those exhibiting 
different morphological characteristics, for identification 
by classic phenotypic tests: lactose fermentation, Gram 
staining, indole production and 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-
D-glucuronide  hydrolysis.  Isolates  presumptively  iden-
tified  as  E.  coli  were  confirmed  by  MALDI-TOF  MS 
(Bruker Biotyper 3.1, Bruker Daltonics). A single con-
firmed E. coli isolate per plate was included in this study 
and submitted for complete characterisation.

Antimicrobial  susceptibility  testing  -  Susceptibility 
was determined by the Clinical Laboratory Standard In-
stitute (CLSI) disk-diffusion method for amoxicillin/cla-
vulanate, ampicillin, aztreonam, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, 
cefuroxime,  chloramphenicol,  ciprofloxacin,  ertapen-
em, fosfomycin/trometamol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, 
tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazone (CLSI 
2014). Isolates were classified as MDR according to pre-
viously described criteria (Magiorakos et al. 2012).

Detection  of  CTX-M  and  pAmpC  β-lactamases  - 
Screening for ESBL producers was conducted by double-
disk synergy testing using aztreonam (30 µg), cefepime 
(30 µg), cefotaxime (30 µg) and ceftazidime (30 µg) as 
substrates and amoxicillin/clavulanate (20/10 µg) as an 
ESBL inhibitor (Jarlier et al. 1988). ESBL-producing E. 
coli isolates were subjected to polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) for different blaCTX-M-groups (Wang et al. 2012). 
Amplification  parameters  varied  slightly  according  to 
the blaCTX-M group analysed. For groups 1, 9 and 25, the 
following PCR conditions were applied: 94ºC for 3 min, 
35 cycles of 94ºC for 30 s, 51ºC for 1 min and 72ºC for 2 
min with a final extension step of 72ºC for 5 min. Am-
plicons for groups 2 and 8 were obtained under the same 
conditions, except for the annealing temperature (56ºC).
Isolates resistant to cefoxitin and amoxicillin/clavu-
lanate were submitted for confirmatory phenotypic test-
ing for AmpC enzymes using cloxacillin (200 µg) as an 
inhibitor (Tan et al. 2009, Peter-Getzlaff et al. 2011). Pos-
itive isolates were examined for the presence of genes 
encoding the pAmpC enzymes CMY, ACC, ACT, DHA, 
FOX, LAT, MIR and MOX by multiplex PCR as previ-
ously described (Pérez-Pérez & Hanson 2002).

Amplicons  were  purified  using  ExoSAP-IT  (USB 
Corporation,  USA)  and  sequenced  by  Macrogen  Inc 
(South  Korea)  to  define  the  blaCTX-M  and  ampC-type 
β-lactamase gene variants. The obtained sequences were 
compared to reference sequences available in GenBank 
(ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

Detection of qnr genes - All isolates were examined 
for qnrA, qnrB and qnrS genes by multiplex PCR as pre-
viously described (Cattoir et al. 2007).

Phylogenetic typing - The phylogenetic group from 
each E. coli isolate was determined by multiplex PCR for 
chuA and yjaA genes and the DNA fragment TspE4C2, 
as described (Clermont et al. 2000).

Enterobacterial  repetitive 

intergenic  consensus 
(ERIC)2-PCR - All isolates were typed by ERIC2-PCR 
(Dias et al. 2008) and DNA fingerprints were assessed 
by  visual  inspection.  Band  profiles  of  representative 
biotypes (selected as described below) were additionally 
analysed by BioNumerics v.7.1 (Applied Maths, Belgium) 
with  Dice  similarity  coefficients,  an  unweighted-pair 
group method using average linkages and a bandwidth 
tolerance of 1%. Isolates with 100% similarity were in-
cluded in a single genotype.

Definition  of  representative  biotypes  -  From  each 
carcass,  one  isolate  of  each  biotype  was  selected  as  a 
representative  strain.  A  biotype  was  defined  for  each 
unique combination of the following characteristics: an-
timicrobial  resistance  profile,  carriage  of  the  assessed 
qnr and β-lactamase encoding genes, phylogenetic group 
and ERIC2-PCR type.

Conjugation  experiments  -  To  determine  the  pres-
ence  of  β-lactamase-encoding  genes  within  conjuga-
tive plasmids, mating-out assays were performed for at 
least one E. coli isolate carrying each β-lactamase gene 
found. The sodium azide-resistant E. coli J53 strain was 
used as the recipient; transconjugants were selected in 
sodium azide (100 mg/L) and ceftriaxone (2 mg/L) con-
taining  plates.  Gene  transfer  was  confirmed  by  PCR 
with a transconjugant DNA template. Transconjugants 
were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility tests for 
β-lactam  and  non-β-lactam  agents  by  disk-diffusion. 
ERIC2-PCR  typing  was  performed  to  distinguish 
transconjugants from donor strains.

RESULTS

Sample collection - A total of 689 colonies were cul-
tured  and  216  (31%)  were  confirmed  as  E.  coli.  From 
these, a subset of 136 isolates was formed, comprising 
63% of the 216 E. coli identified, by selecting one colony 
per agar plate. According to the criteria established and 
considering  the  results  detailed  below,  tthese  isolates 
were grouped into 77 representative biotypes.

Prevalence of MDR isolates - Overall, MDR E. coli 
from carcasses of brands I, II, II and IV comprised 23 out 
of 26 (89%), 21 out of 23 (91%), 11 out of 13 (85%) and 
12 out of 15 (80%) biotypes analysed, respectively. As a 
consequence of the selective pressure applied, high resis-
tance rates for β-lactam agents were observed. Resistance

a: brands I and II, conventional production system and exporters, brand III, conventional production system and local distribu-
tion, brand IV, organic production system and exporter; b: biotype number was arbitrarily determined according to brand and 
number of carcass to strains with a unique combination of the characteristics [antimicrobial resistance profile, carriage of qnr and 
β-lactamase encoding genes, phylogenetic group and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chain reaction 
(ERIC2-PCR) type]; c: biotypes differentiated only by ERIC2-PCR typing; AMC: amoxycillin/clavulanate; AMP: ampicillin; 
ATM: aztreonam; CIP: ciprofloxacin; CLO: chloramphenicol; CTX: cefotaxime; CXM: cefuroxime; FOS: fosfomycin/trometa-
mol; FOX: cefoxitin; GEN: gentamicin; SUL: sulfamethoxazole; SXT: trimethoprim/SUL; TET: tetracycline.

to ampicillin, cefuroxime and cefotaxime occurred in 58 
(75%), 72 (94%) and 45 (58%) of the 77 biotypes, respec-
tively.  Cefoxitin  and  amoxicillin/clavulanate  co-resis-
tance was observed in 21 biotypes (27%). Regarding non-
β-lactam agents, resistance to tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, 
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazone,  chloramphenicol  and 
gentamicin was found in 37 (48%), 35 (45%), 31 (40%), 
18 (23%) and 16 (21%) biotypes, respectively. No isolates 
showed resistance to nitrofurantoin or ertapenem.

Occurrence  of  CTX-M  and  pAmpC-encoding  genes 
-  Overall,  the  45  biotypes  containing  oxyimino-cepha-
losporin-resistant  isolates  showed  at  least  one  of  the 
β-lactamase  determinants  investigated.  Interestingly,  11 
(24%)  of  these  45  biotypes  included  isolates  obtained 
from untreated MacConkey plates. Table summarises the 
results obtained with these strains. Twenty-six biotypes 
(34%)  showed  positive  ESBL  phenotypes  after  double-
disk synergy tests. Further characterisation by PCR and 
sequencing showed 17 blaCTX-M-2, eight blaCTX-M-8 and one 
blaCTX-M-15-carrying biotypes. All isolates included in the 
21 biotypes showing cefoxitin and amoxicillin/clavulanate 
resistance had a phenotype suggestive of AmpC produc-
tion and harboured the blaCMY-2 gene. Two isolates were 
also concomitant carriers of blaCTX-M-type genes (Table).
Occurrence of qnr genes - The qnr genes occurred 
more frequently among the 32 oxyimino-cephalosporin-
susceptible biotypes (n = 9, 28%) than among the 45 re-
sistant (n = 4, 9%) biotypes (p ≤ 0.05). Considering the 
oxyimino-cephalosporin-susceptible biotypes, one car-
ried the qnrS gene and eight carried the qnrB gene. Four 
biotypes concomitantly harboured qnr and β-lactamase 
genes  with  the  following  combinations:  blaCTX-M-2  and 
qnrB, blaCTX-M-8 and qnrB, blaCTX-M-15 and qnrS and blaC-
MY-2 and qnrB (Table).

Phylogenetic  background  –  Regarding  the  phyloge-
netic background, no isolate among the blaCTX-M or blaCMY-
2-positive E. coli belonged to group B2. Biotypes harbour-
ing blaCTX-M-2 were homogeneously distributed among the 

other three phylogenetic groups (4 biotypes in A, 5 in B1 
and 8 in D), but group B1 was the most frequent among 
blaCTX-M-8-carrying biotypes (6 of 8 biotypes, 75%). The 
blaCMY-2-carrying biotypes were associated with phyloge-
netic group D (16 of 21 biotypes, 76%, p ≤ 0.05).

ERIC2-PCR  typing  -  ERIC2-PCR  typing  was  per-
formed to confirm biotype classification and to ensure 
that no duplicate isolates were included in the study. A 
dendrogram from the computer-assisted analysis of the 
bla-carrying biotypes is shown in Figure. A great diver-
sity of types was observed, except for two groups, which 
contained four and two biotypes that exhibited the same 
ERIC2-PCR  types,  but  differed  in  their  non-β-lactam 
antimicrobial resistance profiles.

Genes  blaCTX-M-15,  blaCTX-M-8  and  blaCMY-2,  but  not 
blaCTX-M-2 were transferred by conjugation - Conjugation 
transfer  was  successfully  performed  for  the  blaCTX-M-15, 
blaCTX-M-8 and blaCMY-2 genes. For these experiments, six 
isolates  from  brand  IV  were  selected  as  donor  strains, 
each  carrying  genes  encoding  CTX-M-15,  CTX-M-8, 
CTX-M-2  or  CMY-2  enzymes  only  or  CTX-M-8  plus 
CMY2 or CTX-M-2- plus CMY-2. Four transconjugant 
colonies were obtained for blaCTX-M-15, all with the qnrS 
gene co-transferred. Conjugation was also possible with 
the singular isolates carrying blaCTX-M-8 or blaCMY-2. For 
the  isolate  harbouring  the  blaCTX-M-8 and  blaCMY-2 genes, 
five transconjugants were obtained: one with blaCTX-M-8 
only, two with blaCMY-2 only and two with both genes. For 
the isolate carrying the blaCTX-M-2 and blaCMY-2 genes, five 
transconjugants  with  blaCMY-2  only  were  obtained.  The 
antimicrobial  susceptibility  profile  of  transconjugants 
confirmed the transference and expression of the respec-
tive β-lactamase according to the preferential substrates 
of  these  enzymes.  Because  the  blaCTX-M-2 gene  transfer 
was unsuccessful with isolates from brand IV, conjuga-
tion  experiments  were  performed  with  four  additional 
isolates, two each from brands I and II, carrying only this 
gene. However, blaCTX-M-2 transference was not achieved.

Interestingly,  organic  chicken  carcasses  evalu-
ated  in  our  study  showed  the  greatest  diversity  of  bla 
genes (brand IV in Table). The single isolate presenting 
blaCTX-M-15 and the two isolates simultaneously harbour-
ing  blaCTX-M-type  and  blaCMY-2 were  from  this  brand.  Or-
ganic chicken meat contaminated with ESBL-producing 
bacteria has also been described in Germany and The 
Netherlands (Kola et al. 2012, Stuart et al. 2012). Pos-
sible sources of resistance genes in this setting are the 
introduction  of  one-day-old  chicken  already  colonised 
with  ESBL-producing  organisms  and  the  presence  of 
such strains in the environment, as observed in fatten-
ing farms in Europe (MARAN 2009, Laube et al. 2013). 
In fact, considering the historical use of antimicrobials 
in commercial chicken production, the high rates of re-
sistance observed in Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates 
in this country and the existence of these genes in the 
environment, it is likely that these two possible sources 
exist in organic farms in Brazil (MAPA 2009, Gales et 
al. 2012, Picão et al. 2013).

Isolates carrying blaCTX-M-2 or blaCMY-2 genes tended 
to accumulate resistance to a greater number of non-β-
lactam  antimicrobials  (up  to  5  or  4,  respectively)  than 
did those carrying blaCTX-M-8 genes (maximum 2). This 
tendency  was  independent  of  brand  or  phylogenetic 
group, suggesting that this multidrug-resistance pheno-
type is related to the genetic environment of these deter-
minants, which will be investigated further.

The presence of ESBL and pAmpC-encoding genes 
in less pathogenic phylogenetic lineages could imply that 
they pose a minor risk to human health. However, in the 
present study, β-lactamase genes blaCMY-2, blaCTX-M-8 and 
blaCTX-M-15 of E. coli belonging to phylogenetic groups A 
and D, A and B1 and B1, respectively, were easily trans-
ferred in vitro. This indicates that conjugation in the hu-
man gut with the transfer of blaCTX-M or blaCMY-2 genes 
to more pathogenic B2 strains can occur, enabling the 
establishment of bacterial reservoirs of resistance genes 
in the human population.

In contrast to other β-lactamase genes, the transfer-
ence of blaCTX-M-2 was not achieved, even when testing 
isolates from brands with different production systems 
and commercial profiles. These results are in accordance 
with a study performed with E. coli obtained from two 
Brazilian farms (Ferreira et al. 2014) and suggest that the 
chromosomal location of blaCTX-M-2 may be shared among 
many  isolates  from  Brazilian  chicken  meat.  However, 
further experiments are needed to confirm the genetics 
of this resistance determinant in our collection as well as 
the replicon typing of described self-transmissible plas-
mids carrying blaCTX-M-8, blaCTX-M-15 and blaCMY-2.
The  small  number  of  chicken  carcasses  analysed  is 
a limitation of this study. However, even with this small 
study sample, a great diversity of E. coli isolates carrying 
blaCTX-M-types and blaCMY-2 genes and showing a variety of 
resistance profiles to non-β-lactam antimicrobials was de-
tected. The distribution of these microorganisms in differ-
ent brands, phylogenetic groups and ERIC types supports 
their non-clonal nature and raises concerns about the high 
frequency of these antimicrobial resistance determinants 
in the Brazilian and international food chains.

Distribution of 45 blaCTX-M and blaCMY-2-carrying biotypes according to 
enterobacterial  repetitive  intergenic  consensus-polymerase  chain  re-
action (ERIC2-PCR) typing. A: biotype number was arbitrarily deter-
mined according to brand and number of carcass to strains with a unique 
combination of the following characteristics: antimicrobial resistance 
profile, carriage of qnr and β-lactamase encoding genes, phylogenetic 
group and ERIC2-PCR type; B: brands I and II, conventional production 
system and exporters, brand III, conventional production system and lo-
cal distribution, brand IV, organic production system and exporter.

DISCUSSION

Data  obtained  in  this  study  demonstrated  a  wide 
distribution of β-lactamase-producing-E. coli in chick-
en meat produced in Brazil. The recovery of ESBL or 
plasmid AmpC-producing E. coli even in the absence of 
antimicrobial selection suggests that these isolates might 
be substantially represented among the microbiota from 
Brazilian chicken carcasses. Moreover, a high diversity 
of  antimicrobial  resistance  phenotypes  was  observed 
among genetically diverse isolates, suggesting that con-
ditions promoting resistance are well established.

The  presence  of  MDR  E.  coli-carrying  blaCTX-M-2, 
blaCTX-M-8 and/or blaCMY-2 in chicken meat produced in Bra-
zil has been recently reported (Dhanji et al. 2010, Egervärn 
et al. 2014, Ferreira et al. 2014); nevertheless, the present 
paper is the first to describe blaCTX-M-15 in E. coli from food 
or food-producing animals in South America.
