ABSTRACT

A total of 17 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) 
isolates obtained from 72 cheese samples were included 
in this study. Coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates 
obtained in this study comprised 6 (35.3%) Staphylo-
coccus saprophyticus, 3 (17.6%) Staphylococcus epider-
midis,  2  (11.8%)  Staphylococcus  hominis,  2  (11.8%) 
Staphylococcus  haemolyticus,  1  (5.9%)  Staphylococcus 
xylosus,  1  (5.9%)  Staphylococcus  vitulinus,  1  (5.9%) 
Staphylococcus  lentus,  and  1  (5.9%)  Staphylococcus 
warneri.  The  disc  diffusion  assay  revealed  that  the 
highest occurrence of resistance was found for penicillin 
(76.5%),  erythromycin  (35.3%),  tetracycline  (29.4%), 
and  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  (17.6%)  among 
CNS isolates. However, all CNS isolates were found to 
be susceptible to vancomycin, streptomycin, linezolid, 
and gentamycin. Of the isolates, 64.7% carried at least 
one  of  the  following  antimicrobial  resistance  genes: 
mecA,  tet(M),  erm(B),  blaZ,  ant(4′)-la,  aph(3′)-IIIa, 
and lnu(A). The results suggest that improved hygienic 
conditions, such as safer handling of raw milk, proper 
cleaning,  and  sanitation  during  the  manufacturing  in 
the dairies, are urgently needed in Turkey.

Short Communication

Staphylococcus spp. are gram-positive and nonmotile 
bacteria  that  have  been  divided  into  2  groups:  coag-
ulase-positive  and  -negative  staphylococci  (Podkowik 
et  al.,  2013).  Staphylococci  are  widely  distributed  in 
nature, and the primary habitat of staphylococci is the 
skin  and  mucous  membranes  of  humans  and  warm-
blooded animals. Staphylococci are highly tolerant to 
environmental extremes; for instance, they are able to 
grow  well  in  a  wide  pH  range  (4.8–9.4)  and  have  a

high  degree  of  tolerance  to  NaCl  (7.5–10%;  Schleifer 
and Kloos, 1975).

Although  CNS  have  been  considered  as  nonpatho-
genic  normal  commensal  flora,  recent  studies  have 
shown CNS to be one of the most common causes of 
nosocomial infections, particularly in immunocompro-
mised and hospitalized patients (Koksal et al., 2009). In 
addition, CNS are often found in foods including meat, 
milk, and dairy products, and some strains are used in 
the preparation of fermented foods as a starter culture 
(Zell et al., 2008). Epidemiological studies showed that 
dairy products can be contaminated with CNS by using 
unpasteurized raw milk and also during manufacturing 
practices  by  workers.  A  case  study  of  food  poisoning 
outbreaks  linked  CNS  strains  with  contaminated  un-
pasteurized milk (Do Carmo et al., 2004).The safeness 
of CNS strains in food has been questioned due to the 
fact  that  some  CNS  strains  isolated  from  foods  have 
the  ability  to  produce  several  virulence  factors,  such 
as staphylococcal enterotoxins (Do Carmo et al., 2004; 
Bertelloni et al., 2015; Nunes et al. 2015). In addition, 
antimicrobial resistance and resistance determinants in 
CNS strains from foods has gotten attention because of 
its ability to transfer resistance genes to other bacterial 
species, including Staphylococcus aureus (Hiramatsu et 
al., 2001). The objective of the current study was to as-
sess the distribution of CNS in different types of cheese 
samples in Turkey. Antimicrobial resistance profiles of 
isolated  CNS  together  with  antimicrobial  resistance 
genes were also determined.

 

A total of 72 cheese samples consisting of 11 differ-
ent types (6–7 samples each of White, Kaşar, Tulum, 
Ezine,  Antep,  Sürk,  Lor,  Van  Otlu,  Civil,  Örgü,  and 
Dil) were analyzed in this study. These cheese samples 
were produced from raw or pasteurized cow, goat, and 
sheep milk. All cheese samples were collected from su-
permarkets, open-air markets, and retail shops between 
January and June 2014 in Hatay province, Turkey. All 
samples were transferred to the laboratory in an ice box 
and stored at 4°C before analysis.

Isolation of staphylococci was carried out by suspend-
ing 10 ± 1 g of each cheese sample in buffered peptone

water  (90  mL).  The  suspension  was  then  enriched  at 
37°C for 24 h. After an overnight incubation, mannitol 
salt  agar  plates  were  inoculated  with  0.1  mL  of  the 
enriched  suspension  and  incubated  at  37°C  for  24  h 
(Chajęcka-Wierzchowska  et  al.,  2015).  The  selected 
staphylococci colonies (2–3 small pink or red colonies 
per plate for presumptive staphylococci) were streaked 
on blood agar plates and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. 
The isolates were initially identified as Staphylococcus 
spp.  by  PCR  amplification  of  the  16  ribosomal  DNA 
gene using primers as described by Strommenger et al. 
(2003). All PCR-positive isolates were then examined 
for  coagulase  production  using  rabbit  plasma  with 
EDTA  lyophilized  according  to  the  manufacturer’s 
instructions (Bactident Coagulase, Merck, Darmstadt, 
Germany). The identification of the coagulase negative 
isolates  to  the  species  level  was  further  done  by  us-
ing  VITEK2  automated  system  (bioMérieux,  Marcy-
l'Étoile, France).

The  antimicrobial  resistance  profile  of  selected  iso-
lates was examined by using the disc diffusion method 
as described by the Clinical Laboratory Standards In-
stitute (CLSI, 2015). Eleven antibiotics from different 
classes were included in the assay, including gentamicin 
(10  μg/disc),  streptomycin  (25  μg/disc),  levofloxacin 
(5 μg/disc), vancomycin (30 μg/disc), linezolid (30 μg/
disc),  erythromycin  (15  μg/disc),  penicillin  (10  μg/
disc),  tetracycline  (30  μg/disc),  chloramphenicol  (30 
μg/disc), clindamycin (10 μg/disc), and trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole  (1.25/23.75  μg/disc).  The  bacterial 
inoculum was prepared from an overnight culture and 
density of inoculum was standardized to 0.5 McFarland 
(BioSAN, Riga, Latvia). Bacterial suspension (200 μL) 
was spread onto Muller Hinton agar plate. Antibiotic 
discs were placed on the surface of the agar and inocu-
lated plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h under aero-
bic  conditions.  Staphylococcus  aureus  (ATCC  29213) 
was used as a quality control strain. At the end of the 
incubation, the inhibition zones were measured in the 
plates  with  a  ruler  and  recorded  in  millimeters.  The 
results were interpreted by the CLSI (2015) guidelines 
and intermediary resistance phenotypes were accepted 
as susceptible for this study.

Because  the  disc  diffusion  assay  has  been  not  rec-
ommended  for  the  reporting  of  methicillin  resistance, 
the  mecA  gene  was  screened  in  all  CNS  isolates  by 
PCR, which was accepted to be the gold standard for 
identification  of  methicillin  resistance  (Zhang  et  al., 
2009; CLSI, 2015). All isolates were examined for the 
presence  of  mecA  gene  using  PCR  as  described  pre-
viously  (Choi  et  al.,  2003).  Multiplex  PCR  assay  for 
detection tet(K), tet(L), and tet(O) genes coding efflux 
proteins and tet(M) gene coding ribosomal protection 
proteins were performed as described by Strommenger

et al. (2003). To determine macrolide resistance genes 
[erm(A),  erm(B),  and  erm(C)],  PCR  was  performed 
according to Jensen et al. (1999). In addition, all iso-
lates were screened for the presence of aminoglycosides 
[aac(6′)-Ie-aph(2′′)-Ia, 
resistance-associated 
ant(4′)-la,  and  aph(3′)-IIIa  (Choi  et  al.,  2003),  blaZ 
(Vesterholm-Nielsen et al., 1999), and lnuA genes (Lina 
et al., 1999)], also determined by PCR.

genes 

A total of 17 staphylococci isolated from cheese sam-
ples were positive for 16S rDNA genes and were further 
identified to species level by using automated VITEK 
2 system. These CNS isolates were belong to 8 species 
which were distributed as follows: Staphylococcus sapro-
phyticus (n = 6/17; 35.3%), Staphylococcus epidermidis 
(n = 3/17; 17.6%), Staphylococcus hominis (n = 2/17; 
11.8%), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 2/17; 11.8%), 
Staphylococcus xylosus (n = 1/17; 5.9%), Staphylococ-
cus vitulinis (n = 1/17; 5.9%), Staphylococcus lentus (n 
= 1/17; 5.9%), and Staphylococcus warneri (n = 1/17; 
5.9%).

The  results  of  the  antimicrobial  susceptibility  tests 
revealed  that  88.2%  (n  =  15/17)  of  CNS  strains  dis-
played antimicrobial resistance to at least one antibiotic 
(Table 1). In addition, 5 CNS isolates (29.4%) showed 
multidrug  resistance  (3  or  more  class  of  antimicrobi-
als). As presented in Table 1, CNS isolates were 76.5% 
resistant  to  penicillin,  35.3%  resistant  to  erythromy-
cin,  and  29.4%  resistant  to  tetracycline.  Resistance 
was  also  detected  to  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 
(17.6%), levofloxacin (11.8%), clindamycin (5.9%), and 
chloramphenicol  (5.9%).  No  isolate  was  resistant  to 
gentamycin,  vancomycin,  streptomycin,  and  linezolid. 
Staphylococcus  vitulinis  was  found  to  be  susceptible 
against all antibiotics tested.

In the current study, all CNS isolates were screened 
for selected resistance genes. As presented in Table 1, 3 
isolates of S. epidermidis and 1 S. haemolyticus isolate 
were  positive  for  the  mecA  gene.  The  4  tetracycline-
resistant isolates were found to carry the tet(M) gene, 
whereas  only  2  erythromycin-resistant  isolates  con-
tained erm(B) gene. Eight CNS isolates were confirmed 
to harbor the blaZ gene. Even though none of the CNS 
isolates  were  found  to  be  resistant  to  gentamycin  or 
streptomycin, the PCR results showed that aph(3′)-IIIa 
(n = 4) and ant(4′)-la (n = 2) genes were present in 6 
isolates. In addition, the lnu(A) gene was detected in 
2 isolates.

Coagulase-negative staphylococci used to be consid-
erably less important due to their nonpathogenic char-
acteristics when compared with S. aureus. As a result, 
a limited number of studies on the CNS isolated from 
foods were performed even though CNS are very com-
mon on dairy products, with the main source of CNS 
coming  from  raw  milk  and  the  hands  of  employees. 

SHORT COMMUNICATION: RESISTANCE AMONG STAPHYLOCOCCI

Recently, CNS gained great attention as being one of 
the  leading  bacterial  groups  associated  with  mastitis 
in  cows  and  sheep  (Pyörälä  and  Taponen,  2009)  and 
nosocomial infections in humans (Koksal et al., 2009). 
Our study, therefore, was conducted to investigate the 
occurrence  of  CNS  in  Turkish  cheese  samples,  which 
might have a significant role as a reservoir. Of 72 cheese 
samples examined in this study, 17 (23.6%) were found 
to be positive for CNS. In an earlier study in Turkey, 
CNS was recovered from 16.2% of dairy products, in-
cluding Tulum cheese (Pamuk et al., 2010). In another 
study of bovine milk samples with mastitis, Kırkan et 
al.,  (2005)  also  found  that  CNS  was  present  in  20% 
of  milk  samples  examined.  Among  the  isolated  CNS 
strains, the following species were identified in the cur-
rent study: S. saprophyticus, S. epidermidis, S. hominis, 
S. haemolyticus, S. xylosus, S. vitulinis, S. lentus, and S. 
warneri. In a study of staphylococcal isolates from raw 
milk and cheese in Italy, Ruaro et al., (2013) found that 
all raw milk and cheese samples had CNS at concen-
trations up to 104 and 105 cfu/mL, respectively. Their 
study on the raw milk and cheese revealed the following 
as  the  most  common  species:  Staphylococcus  equorum 
(12%), S. lentus (12%), Staphylococcus simulans (12%), 
Staphylococcus sciuri (10%), and S. xylosus (9%; Ruaro 
et al., 2013). In a study of French cow milk and cheeses, 
Coton  et  al.,  (2010)  also  recovered  15  different  CNS 
species  with  S.  equorum,  S.  xylosus,  S.  saprophyticus, 
and Staphylococcus succinus as the most dominant spe-
cies. Among the isolated CNS species, S. xylosus is well 
established as the most commonly used starter culture, 
particularly  in  sausages  (Zell  et  al.,  2008);  however, 
some studies have reported S. xylosus in animal infec-

tions  (Taponen  et  al.,  2006).  Although  the  beneficial 
aspects  of  CNS  to  the  development  of  characteristics 
of fermented dairy products are unquestioned, some of 
the species, particularly S. saprophyticus and S. epider-
midis, have been associated with human illness (Otto, 
2009).

Coagulase-negative staphylococci have been found to 
be resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents, including 
methicillin, which limits treatment options for staphy-
lococcal infections. In these cases, other antimicrobials, 
including teicoplanin and vancomycin, are mostly con-
sidered as alternative drugs to treat severe infections. 
A  previous  report  showed  that  methicillin  resistance 
rates  increased  in  a  hospital  environment  (Koksal  et 
al., 2009), suggesting that the presence of methicillin-
resistant staphylococci in foods is troublesome. Of the 
various CNS isolates tested, 3 isolates of S. epidermidis 
and  1  of  S.  haemolyticus  were  positive  for  the  mecA 
gene (n = 4; 23.5%) in the current study. Guran and 
Kahya (2015) recently determined the presence of mecA 
gene in 12 of 118 CNS strains isolated from ground beef 
and lamb meat samples in Turkey. A much higher car-
riage  rate  (81.5%)  of  mecA-positive  CNS  from  minas 
cheese was described in Brazil by Fontes et al. (2013). 
However, in another study, performed by Resch et al. 
(2008)  in  Germany,  the  mecA  gene  was  not  detected 
in  food-associated  CNS  isolates,  suggesting  different 
prevalence rate in different geographical locations.

The current study confirmed previous findings that 
the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance of CNS iso-
lates vary according to the species (Resch et al., 2008; 
Even et al., 2010). In the current study, CNS isolates 
were found to be phenotypically resistant to penicillin

(76.5%). This is consistent with recent studies in which 
high rates of penicillin resistance were reported for CNS 
isolates of food, animal, or human clinical origin in Tur-
key (Turutoglu et al., 2006; Pamuk et al., 2010; Kenar 
et  al.,  2012).  This  result  is  not  surprising  given  that 
penicillin is the most prescribed agent for the treatment 
of mastitis in cows in Turkey (Turutoglu et al., 2006), 
although the exact amount of antimicrobial agents and 
their  classes  used  in  animal  husbandry  is  unknown. 
The results were, however, contradictory with another 
study,  which  reported  no  high  resistance  to  penicillin 
(18%; Even et al., 2010). The resistance to erythromy-
cin, tetracycline, levofloxacin, and chloramphenicol was 
similar to those obtained from foods in the European 
Union (Even et al., 2010) and from subclinical mastitis 
milks  in  Turkey  (Aslantas  et  al.  2014;  Bansal  et  al., 
2015). This is inconsistent with the findings of Pamuk 
et  al.  (2010),  who  reported  higher  resistance  rate  to 
erythromycin, gentamycin, tetracycline, chlorampheni-
col, and vancomycin in CNS isolates from Tulum cheese 
and raw buffalo milk in Turkey. In the current study, 2 
S. epidermidis (n = 2/3; 66.6%) and 1 S. haemolyticus 
isolate  (n  =  1/2;  50%)  were  found  to  be  resistant  to 
trimethroprim-sulfamethoxazole,  which  was  reported 
to  be  alternative  to  the  penicillins  for  staphylococcal 
infections  (Koksal  et  al.,  2009).  In  addition,  all  the 
isolated strains were susceptible to vancomycin, strep-
tomycin, linezolid, and gentamycin.

Several antimicrobial resistance genes were reported 
in CNS in different countries (Chajęcka-Wierzchowska 
et al., 2015; Guran and Kahya, 2015; Rebecchi et al., 
2015).  At  least  one  of  the  tested  genes  was  found  in 
64.7% of the CNS strains isolated in the current study, 
in accordance with recently published studies (Guran 
and  Kahya,  2015;  Rebecchi  et  al.,  2015).  Approxi-
mately 47% of the CNS strains in our study harbored 
the structural gene blaZ that is the main mechanism of 
penicillin  resistance  in  staphylococci.  Guran  and  Ka-
hya (2015) also reported a similar rate (46.2%) in CNS 
isolates from retail ground meats in Turkey. However, 
Resch et al., (2008) reported that only 10% of penicillin-
resistant CNS isolates harbored the blaZ gene. In the 
current study, tet(M) was the only encountered gene in 
tetracycline-resistant CNS. Similarly, tet(M) has been 
reported from ready-to-eat food in Poland (Chajęcka-
Wierzchowska et al., 2015) and ground beef and lamb 
meat  samples  in  Turkey  (Guran  and  Kahya,  2015). 
Only 2 erythromycin-resistant CNS isolates carried the 
erm(B) gene, whereas in the remaining erythromycin-
resistant strains the erm gene was not found, suggesting 
that other macrolide resistance genes such as msr(A/B) 
could be present (Chajęcka-Wierzchowska et al., 2015). 
Of  the  17  CNS  isolates  tested,  6  (35.2%)  were  posi-
tive for genes encoding aminoglycoside resistance; these 

Journal of Dairy Science Vol. 99 No. 4, 2016

included the ant(4′)-la (n = 4; 23.5%) and aph(3′)-IIIa 
genes (n = 2; 11.8%). But the presence of these genes 
determined by PCR did not associate with phenotypic 
gentamicin  or  streptomycin  resistance.  This  discor-
dance between gentamycin resistance and the presence 
of aac(6′)-Ie-aph(2′′)-Ia, ant(4′)-la, and aph(3′)-IIIa has 
also been stated for clinical CNS isolates (Duran et al., 
2012).

In conclusion, the results of this study revealed that 
the most isolated strains were S. saprophyticus, S. epi-
dermidis, S. hominis, and S. haemolyticus. Coagulase-
negative  staphylococci  strains  have  shown  to  have 
multidrug  resistance  to  penicillin,  tetracycline,  and 
erythromycin, which are commonly used in veterinary 
practice, suggesting that particular attention should be 
paid to antimicrobial choice for treatment of diseases, 
particularly mastitis, in cows. In addition, the presence 
of antimicrobial resistance genes in CNS isolated from 
cheese samples is a major problem, as these strains can 
act as a reservoir for resistance genes to other bacterial 
species. Even though the number of samples examined 
in the current study is not high, it might be said that 
improved hygienic conditions such as safer handing of 
raw  milk,  proper  cleaning,  and  sanitation  during  the 
manufacturing in the dairies are increasingly important 
to reduce the prevalence of multidrug resistance among 
CNS isolates in Turkey.
