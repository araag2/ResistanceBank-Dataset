Abstract

Background: Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7) have frequently been associated with food borne illness and
are considered as most serious of known food borne pathogens leading to severe illnesses and high mortality rates
in humans. Most of outbreaks were traced to raw meat and raw milk consumption, as well as to dairy products such as
yogurt and cheese derived from raw milk.
Results: Out of 200 samples examined, 40 (20%) and 7 (3.5%) of the samples were positive to E. coli and E. coli O157:
H7 respectively. The highest isolation of E. coli was from cheese (40%), followed by raw milk (32%), yogurt (25.71%),
beef (13.84%), and pasteurized milk (0%). Among E. coli O157:H7 isolates, the highest isolation was from raw milk (12%)
followed by cheese (5.71%) and meat (3.07%). However, no E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from pasteurized milk and
yogurt. Antibiotic susceptibility profile showed that E. coli was resistant for vancomycin (89.74%), ampicillin (76.92%)
and streptomycin (69.23%). The analysis showed that, 92.5% of isolates showed multidrug resistance comprising 2–4
antimicrobials.
Conclusion: The occurrence of E. coli O157:H7 and its multiple antibiotic resistant profiles shows a risk for public health
and food safety as well as animal production. These findings stress the need for an integrated control of E. coli O157:H7
from farm production to consumption of food of animal origin.

Background
Foodborne diseases and food poisoning are the wide-
spread and great public health and well-being concerns of
individuals and countries of the modern world. Especially,
developing countries are largely affected by food-borne
infections (Carbas et al. 2012). Among the major infec-
tious agents, Escherichia coli O157:H7 has frequently been
associated with foodborne illness. Particularly, over the
past decade, E. coli O157:H7 has been reported increas-
ingly from all parts of the world and in the worst case, it is
“one of the most serious” foodborne pathogens leading to
severe illnesses and high mortality rates in humans

Full list of author information is available at the end of the article

(Blanco et al. 2003; Jo et al. 2004). This consideration is in
fact due to the small
infectious dose of the organism
because fewer than 40 cells of E. coli O157:H7 can cause
illness in some people (Strachan et al. 2005).

It has been indicated that an estimated 74,000 cases and
61 deaths annually are attributable to E. coli O157:H7 in
the USA, and many outbreaks (in the USA) related to
foodborne illness have been connected to consumption of
contaminated foods derived from cattle, especially meat
and raw milk. In the 1980s, most outbreaks due to E. coli
O157:H7 were associated with inadequately cooked ham-
burgers and raw milk. Later, outbreaks were traced to
other dairy products such as yogurt and cheese (Doyle et
al. 2006; Mora et al. 2007). More recently, in 2016 out-
break of E. coli O157:H7, slaughtered animals were the

main sources of infection and led to illness of eleven
people in the USA (CDC, 2016).

Escherichia coli O157:H7 has been found in the intes-
tines of healthy cattle, deer, goats, and sheep. However,
cattle have been identified as a major reservoir of E. coli
O157:H7 and consumption of foods of bovine origin
such as beef and dairy products have been associated
with some of the largest food poisoning outbreaks in
which this organism was identified as the etiologic agent
(Acha and Szyfress, 2001;
IFT (Institute of Food
Technology), 2003; Perelle et al. 2007).

Due to an increased demand for animal protein, the
animal production sectors in low and middle-income coun-
tries have been regularly using antimicrobials for therapy,
disease prevention and growth (Van Boeckel et al. 2015).
This practice could be responsible for antimicrobial resist-
ance among commensals in the intestinal tracts of food ani-
mals, which may subsequently risk public health due to
food animals’ weak response to, or loss of response to, drug
therapy. Hence, there should be isolation of pathogenic
organisms and regular evaluation of their antimicrobial sus-
ceptibility profiles. In Ethiopia, some studies have been con-
ducted to identify pathogenic E. coli from human and
animal sources such as stool samples (Demisse, 2005), raw
beef, sheep meat, goat meat (Hiko et al. 2008; Lula 2011),
feces, skin of meat handlers (Mersha et al. 2010), yogurt
and cheese (Tsegaye and Ashenafi 2005). However, recent
and detailed information on the prevalence and multi-drug
susceptibility profile of pathogenic E. coli is limited. Therefore,
the present study was conducted to add current information
pertaining to the occurrence and antibiotic susceptibility pro-
files of E. coli and E. coli O157:H7 from milk, milk products
and meat in and around Bishoftu, Central Ethiopia, where
food of animal origin is widely consumed.

Methods
Study area
The study was conducted in Bishoftu town. Bishoftu town
is located at 9°N latitude and 40°E longitudes at an altitude
of 1850 m above sea level in central high lands of Ethiopia.
It has an annual rainfall of 866 mm of which 84% is in the
long rainy season (June to September). The dry season
extends from October to February. The mean annual
maximum and minimum temperatures are 26 °C and 14 °
C respectively, with mean relative humidity of 61.3%
(ADARDO 2007). The livestock production system in the
area is both intensive and extensive type (CSA 2015).

Study design and sampling strategy
A cross-sectional study was conducted from November
2016 to April 2017 to determine the occurrence and anti-
microbial resistance profile of E. coli O157:H7 in/for milk,
milk products (cheese and yogurt) and beef samples. In
the present study 200 samples (milk = 65, cheese = 35,

yogurt = 35 and meat = 65) were collected on a voluntary
basis (owner’s willingness to provide the samples). Cafete-
rias, restaurants, open markets and supermarket that had
a high level of consumers were included in the study.

Collection and transportation of samples for laboratory
analysis
About 20 ml of milk (both pasteurized and raw), cheese
and yogurt samples were collected aseptically in sterile
disposable corked plastic tubes. The pasteurized milk,
cheese and yogurt obtained from the cafeterias, restau-
rants, and supermarket were kept under refrigerator until
used for consumption by customers. The pasteurized milk
was packaged using a disposable small plastic bag,
whereas the cheese and yogurt were kept in silver/glass
vessels until used for consumption. The raw milk samples
were obtained from milk sellers found in open markets
(the streets of the town). Milk found on the open markets
was handled with a plastic container of up to 3 litters’ cap-
acity and with no cooling facility. About 25 g of beef meat
sample was taken from carcass hanged inside the houses
of restaurants and placed in a disposable plastic bag. The
entire collected samples were labeled appropriately, placed
in a box containing ice and transported immediately to
Microbiology Laboratory, College of Veterinary Medicine
and Agriculture, Addis Ababa University. Then the sam-
ples were placed in a refrigerator at +4 °C and subjected
to culture within 24 h of sampling.

Isolation and identification of Escherichia coli and
Escherichia coli O157:H7
Detection of E. coli and E. coli O157:H7 was carried out
according to the protocol of ISO-16654: 2001 standard.
A loopful of milk, cheese and yogurt aseptically taken
from all of the sample bottles and a swab from the
surface of about 25 g portions of meat dissected by ster-
ilized blade from all of the meat samples collected were
individually inoculated on MacConkey agar for primary
isolation of E. coli (Difco laboratories, USA) and incu-
bated aerobically at 37 °C for 24 h. The plates were
observed for the growth of E. coli (pink colony; lactose
fermenter). A single,
isolated colony was picked and
sub-cultured on Eosin Metyline Blue (EMB) agar for for-
mation of metallic sheen. Simultaneously another single
colony with similar characteristics was picked and
stained with Gram’s stain. The isolate was examined for
stain and morphological characteristics using bright-field
microscopy. KOH test was then employed to confirm
the Gram’s reaction (Quinn et al. 2004). Suspected col-
onies of E. coli (pinkish color appearance on MacConkey
agar and metallic sheen on EMB) (Figs. 1 and 2) were
then sub-cultured onto blood agar to appreciate colony
characteristics and then pure colonies taken from blood
agar were inoculated on nutrient agar (OXOID) (non-

selective media). Biochemical tests were performed to
confirm the E. coli using catalase test, Indole Production
test, Methyl red test, Voges proskaur test, and Simmon’s
Citrate test on tryptone broth, MR-VP medium and Simon
citrate agar respectively (ISO 2003). Then the bacterium
that was confirmed as E. coli was subcultured onto Sorbitol
MacConkey agar (SMA) (OXOID, England) from nutrient
agar (OXOID). SMA (OXOID, England) and plates were
incubated at 35 °C for 20 to 22 h. E. coli O157:H7 does not
ferment sorbitol and, therefore, produces colorless colonies
(Fig. 3). In contrast, most other E. coli strains ferment sorb-
itol and form pink colonies (Soomro et al. 2002) (Fig. 4).
All non-sorbitol
fermenting colonies from the Sorbitol
MacConkey agar were subjected to slide agglutination with

Agar. Note the whitish colonial appearance (non-sorbitol fermenters) of E.

the E. coli O157:H7 latex test kit (OXOID). The latex beads
were coated with antibodies which bind to any O157 or
H7 antigens on the test organisms, forming a visible anti-
gen antibody precipitate (DeBoer and Heuvelink 2000).
Colonies giving a precipitation reaction were confirmed as
E. coli O157:H7 positive.

Antimicrobial susceptibility test of Escherichia coli
Antibiotic susceptibility tests of all E. coli isolates were
performed following the standard agar disk diffusion
method according to (CLSI (clinical and laboratory stan-
dards institute), 2012) using commercially available anti-
microbial disks. Isolates were screened for susceptibility

Ciproflocxazilin (CIP) (5 μg), Vancomycin (VA) (30 μg),
Streptomycin (S) (10 μg) and Ceftriaxone (CRO) (30 μg)
by the disk diffusion assay (Becton Dickinson BBL
Diagnostics) in Mueller-Hinton agar. Each isolated bac-
terial colony from pure fresh culture was transferred
into a test tube of 5 ml Tryptone Soya Broth (TSB)
(OXOID, England) and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. The
test broth was adjusted to McFarland 0.5 turbidity to ob-
tain desired bacterial population. Mueller-Hinton agar
(Bacton Dickinson and Company, Cockeysville, MD,
USA) plates were prepared according to the manufac-
turer guidelines. A sterile cotton swab was immersed
into the inoculum suspension and rotated against the
side of the tube to remove the excess fluid and then
swabbed in three directions uniformly on the surface of
Mueller-Hinton agar plates. After the plates dried, anti-
biotic disks were placed on the inoculated plates using
sterile forceps. The antibiotic disks were gently pressed
onto the agar to ensure firm contact with the agar sur-
face, and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Following this the
diameter of inhibition zone formed around each disk
was measured using a black surface, reflected light and
transparent ruler by lying it over the plates. The results
were classified as sensitive,
intermediate or resistant
according to the standardized table supplied by CLSI
(clinical and laboratory standards institute) (2012) (Table 1).

Statistical analysis
The collected data for bacterial contamination analysis
were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 17 com-
puter software. Accordingly, descriptive statistics such as
percentages and frequency distribution were used to
describe/present bacterial isolates and antimicrobial sus-
ceptibility which was expressed as percent of resistant,
intermediate or susceptible.

Results
Occurrence of E. coli and E. coli O157:H7 from milk, milk
products and meat
In the present study, out of 200 bacteriologically exam-
ined samples, 40 (20%) were harboring E. coli. The high-
est isolation was from cheese (40%), followed by raw
milk (32%), yogurt (25.71%), meat (13.84%) and pasteur-
ized milk (0%). Out of 200 samples, 7 (3.5%) were con-
taminated by E. coli O157:H7. The highest isolation rate
of E. coli O157:H7 was from raw milk (12%) followed by
cheese (5.71%) and meat (3.07%), whereas it was not iso-
lated from pasteurized milk and yogurt were (Table 2).

Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns
The study of antimicrobial sensitivity of E. coli recovered
from different sample types revealed a varying degree of sus-
ceptibility to antimicrobial agents used. Accordingly, E. coli
was highly susceptible to Ceftriaxone (100%), Tetracycline
(97.5%), Ciprofloxacillin (97.5%), Chloramphenicol (92.5%),
and Gentamycin (82.5%). Furthermore, resistance of 90%,
80% and 77.5% was developed to Vancomycin, Ampicillin
and Streptomycin respectively (Table 3 & Fig. 5).

Multidrug resistance analysis

showed that, 37/40
(92.5%) of tested E. coli isolates were resistant to differ-
ent combinations of two or more antimicrobials (Table 4)
and the proportion was higher in milk and milk prod-
ucts (28.4%) than meat samples (15.4%) (Table 5). A
multidrug resistance pattern consisting of
four drugs
was seen in 3/40 (7.5%) isolates. Moreover, the majority
of the isolates 16/40 (40%) showed multidrug resistance
to Ampicillin, Vancomycin and Streptomycin. All
iso-
lates of E. coli O157:H7 were resistance to at least two
drugs and 14.4% of them showed resistance to Ampicil-
lin, Vancomycin, Streptomycin and Tetracycline.

Discussion
The present study revealed that E. coli was isolated from
20% of ready to eat foods of animal origin (milk, milk
products and meat). Meanwhile, the study confirmed
that E. coli and E. coli O157:H7 were not found in
pasteurized milk. The presence of E. coli in pasteurized
milk doesn’t reflect the survival of the organism to the
appropriate level of pasteurizing temperature. Rather, it

might be due to poor hygienic handling after the milk is
pasteurized, which contributes to milk contamination
(Ali and Abdelgadir 2011).

Similar with the present finding, Mekuria et al. (2014)
showed that 23.7% samples from food of bovine origin har-
bored E. coli. Furthermore, 32% of raw milk samples were
found to harbor E. coli, which is somewhat in agreement
with the report of 33.9% by Disassa et al. (2017). However,
the prevalence is far lower when compared to the reports
of Shunda et al. (2013) from Mekelle town (44%) and far
higher when compared to 26% prevalence reported by
Farhan et al. (2014) and 23.3% by Elbagory et al. (2016). In
the present study, the isolation rate of E. coli O157:H7 from
raw milk was 12%, which is comparable to prevalence
report of 10.4% by Mekuria and Beyene (2014). Whereas,
the highest occurrence of E. coli O157:H7 were found by
Chye et al. (2004) (33.5%) and Lye et al. (2013) (18.75%) in
Malaysia. This might be due to differences in animal

management, milking systems, and milk handling practices
among different countries.

In the present study, 5.71% isolation rate of E. coli
O157:H7 was recorded from cheese sample. This rate is
slightly higher than the report of Sancak et al. (2015)
with 2% prevalence. In the study of Zelalem et al. (2015),
E. coli O157:H7 was found to survive the manufacturing
of Ayib (Ethiopian cottage cheese). In Ethiopian cottage
cheese, complete inactivation of the organism occurred
after 20 and 40 min of cooking at 70 °C, indicating that
if there is under treatment of heat, the cheese can act as
source of Escherichia coli O157:H7 (Zelalem et al. 2015).
Furthermore, Spano et al. (2003) stated that, cheese
could be free of E. coli O157:H7 if high temperature is
used during milk processing. Furthermore, in some types
of cheese like Cheddar cheese, E. coli O157:H7 has the
ability to grow during the manufacture of the cheese and
it could be detected by enrichment after 60 days of

ripening (Reitsma and Henning 1996). In addition, Ram-
saran et al. (1998) observed a significant increase in the
number of E. coli O157:H7 during the manufacture of
Camembert cheese, and stabilized number of colony
forming units can be found after 75 days, indicating the
potential for survival in this type of cheese.

The other finding of the present study is that Escherichia
coli O157:H7 was not isolated from yogurt (Ethiopian nat-
urally fermented milk) samples. Contrarily, Vahedi et al.
(2013) reported 9% prevalence of Escherichia coli O157:H7
in yogurt samples and Zelalem et al. (2015) indicated that
E. coli O157:H7 was found to survive the manufacturing of
Ergo (Ethiopian naturally fermented milk). However, the
absence of E. coli O157:H7 from yogurt is partly supported
by the study of Osaili et al. (2013), who found that E. coli
O157:H7 increased during fermentation and the population
of E. coli O157:H7 decreased slightly during cooling. In
connection to this, Osaili et al. (2013) indicated that lower-
ing the temperature during cooling may lead to the
increased susceptibility of E. coli O157:H7 to an acid envir-
onment and the population of E. coli O157:H7 during stor-
age at +4 oC decreased sharply. It was evident that almost

all cafeterias in the study area had refrigeration, and this
could partly contribute for the absence of the isolates in the
yogurt samples. Overall, the variation in the prevalence
reports of the organism from cheese and yogurt samples
could be due to differences in procedures followed during
preparation of the dairy products, as well as improved
enrichment and isolation procedures.

As shown in Table 2, 3.07% of meat samples were har-
boring E. coli O157:H7, which is comparable to Hiko et
al. (2008), Mersha et al. (2010), Jacob et al. (2014) and
Zarei et al. (2013) who reported 4.2% (from Modjo and
Debre zeit), 5.1% (from Modjo), 2.86% (from China) and
2.8% (from Iran), respectively. However, in Ethiopia, far
higher prevalence was reported by Lula 2011 (11.2%),
Mekuria and Beyene 2014 (10.4%) and Bekele 2012
(10.2%)
from Dire Dawa, Tigray region and Addis
Ababa, respectively. These variations could be due to
differences in the hygienic conditions of meat prepar-
ation, processing, as well as storage.

The use of antibiotics in the treatment of E. coli O157:H7
infection is controversial, since antimicrobial therapy may
increase the risk of development of hemolytic uremic syn-
drome (Molbak et al. 2002). Although some studies do not
advise antibiotic treatment for infections caused by such
bacteria, others suggest that disease progression may be
prevented by administrating antibiotics during the early
stage of infection (Schroeder et al. 2002). Thus, for the bet-
ter response, an antimicrobial susceptibility test is necessary
(Quinn et al. 2011). Hence, on the basis of this necessity,
antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted on the
isolates recovered from all the samples.

The present study showed that E. coli isolates were
highly sensitive to ceftriaxone, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin,
chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Meanwhile, the major-
ity of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin, strepto-
mycin and vancomycin. Similarly, Hiko et al. (2008) and
Bekele (2012) from Ethiopia and Magwira et al. (2005)
from Botswana revealed that the resistance of E. coli does
exist mainly to ampicillin and streptomycin. However,
various authors reported that E. coli is resistant to tetra-
cycline (Hiko et al. 2008; Bekele 2012; Mude et al. 2017),
which is contrary to the results of the present study. But
in Dire Dawa, Mohammed et al. (2014) reported that E.
coli was susceptible to tetracycline, which is in line with
the present study finding.

Multidrug resistance analysis showed that 37/40 (92.5%)
of tested isolates were resistant to different combinations
of two to four tested antibiotics. This is in agreement with
the report of Mude et al. (2017), who showed 92.3% of iso-
lates were multidrug resistant. Moreover, various authors
(Bekele et al. 2014; Iweriebor et al. 2015; Atnafie et al.
2017) from the country and abroad reported multidrug re-
sistance patterns. Moreover, the present study revealed
that the prevalence of multidrug resistant isolates was

Bedasa et al. International Journal of Food Contamination  (2018) 5:2

higher in milk and milk products (28.4%) as compared to
meat (15.4%) samples. This higher occurrence in dairy
products could be related to the greater emphasis given to
dairy production compared to beef production in the
study district. Multidrug resistance usually occurred either
due to indiscriminate utilization of antimicrobial agents or
genetic mutation, which was difficult to elucidate with the
present study methodology.

Conclusion
The presence of E. coli O157:H7 in foods of animal ori-
gin may originate from infected animals or unhygienic
conditions during processing, handling and distribution.
Importantly, the occurrence of E. coli O157:H7 and its
multiple antibiotic resistant profiles shows a risk for
public health and food safety, as well as animal health
and production (Ulukanli et al. 2006). The higher preva-
lence of multidrug resistant E. coli isolates in dairy prod-
ucts is especially alarming. Proper handling and cooking
foods of animal origin are probably as important in pre-
venting E. coli O157:H7 infections.
