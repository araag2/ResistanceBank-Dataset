Food-borne  pathogens  are  the  leading  cause  of  morbidity  and  mortality  in  developing  countries. 
Changes  in  eating  habits,  mass  catering,  unsafe  food  storage  conditions  and  poor  hygiene  practices 
are major contributing factors to food associated illnesses. In Ethiopia, the widespread habit of ready-
to-eat  food  consumption  is  potential  cause  of  food  borne  illnesses.  The  present  study  aimed  at 
investigating  the  prevalence  and  antimicrobial susceptibility  profile of  Salmonella  species from  ready-
to-eat  foods  from  catering  establishments  in  Jigjiga  City  and  determining  susceptibility  pattern  of 
bacterial  isolates.  This  study  aimed  to  assess  the  ready-to-eat  foods  Salmonella  prevalence  and 
antimicrobial resistance pattern of the isolates.  In total, various food samples were collected from  120 
hotels and processed to detect Salmonella presence. The ready-to-eat food samples were collected and 
assessed  bacteriologically  for  Salmonella  strains.  A  total  of  120  food  samples  were  bacteriologically 
evaluated.  After  confirmation,  25  samples  (20.8%)  were  positive  to  Salmonella.  A  total  of  5  drug 
resistance  patterns  were  detected  among  Salmonella  isolates.  Out  of  the  25  isolates  10  (40%)  were 
resistant  to  three  antibiotics,  8  (28%)  of  the  isolates  were  resistant  to  4  of  the  antibiotics  tested, 
whereas 5 (20%) were resistant to two antibiotics, only 1 (4%) isolate was resistant to 1 antibiotic but 1 
(4%) isolate was resistant to five antibiotics. The lack of public sanitary facilities can be another hurdle 
to  keep  the  desirable  hands  hygiene  of  the  vendors.  In  this  study,  it  is  reported  that  severity  of  the 
current scenario among the hotel worker hygiene and they are the unknowingly playing role in spread 
of diseases like Salmonellosis.

INTRODUCTION  
 
Foodborne  outbreaks  caused  by  Salmonella  represent  a 
major  public  health  problem  worldwide,  and  developing 
countries  are  affected  by  a  wide  range  of  foodborne 
diseases  (Zeru  and  Kumie,  2007).  These  low-income 
countries face the highest burden of  diarrheal  and  other 

food-borne  disease  associated  with  the  consumption  of 
contaminated  food  (Zeru  and  Kumie,  2007).  Salmonella 
are  a m o n g   the  major  d isease bacteria in  humans as 
well  as  in  animals. Salmonella s p e c i e s  are  leading 
causes  of  acute  gastroenteritis   in    several  countries

important  public 
and  salmonellosis  remains  an 
health problem worldwide,  particularly in the  developing 
countries  (Rotimi  et  al.,  2008).  Salmonellosis  is  the 
most common  food  borne disease in  both developing 
and  developed  countries,  although  incidence  rates 
vary  according  to  the  country  (Stevens  et  al.,  2006). 
The  fecal  wastes  from  infected  animals  and  humans 
are  important  sources  of  bacterial  contamination  of 
the  environment  and  the  food  chain  (Ponce  et  al., 
2008). 

risks  associated  with 

Antimicrobial-resistant  Salmonella  are 

increasing 
due  to  the  use  of  antimicrobial  agents  in  food  at 
sub-therapeutic  level  or  prophylactic  doses  which 
may  promote  on-farm  selection  of  antimicrobial 
resistant  strains  and  markedly  increase  the  human 
health 
of 
contaminated  food  products  (Zewdu  and  Cornelius, 
2009).  Food  borne 
the 
consumption  of  foods  has  been  reported  in  several 
places  in  Ethiopia  and  elsewhere  (Estrada-Garcia  et 
al.,  2004;  Chumber  et  al.,  2007;  Ghosh  et  al.,  2007). 
Antimicrobial  use  in  animal  production  systems  has 
long  been  suspected  to  be  the  cause  of  emergence 
and  dissemination  of  antimicrobial 
resistant 
Salmonella (Alexander et al., 2009). 

illness  associated  with 

consumption 

Different  studies  conducted  in  Ethiopia 

indicated 
considerable  prevalence  of  Salmonella  both  in  ready 
to eat foods and  food handlers  (Molla et al., 2003). So, 
the aim  of  this study was  to  determine  the  prevalence 
and  antimicrobial  susceptibility  pattern  of  Salmonella 
isolates from ready-to-eat  foods  from  Jigjiga  City  food 
establishments. 
 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
Description of the study area and period 
 
This  study  was  conducted  in  Jigjiga  City,  located  650  km  South 
East  of  Addis  Ababa.  The  study  was  conducted  from  March  to 
October,  2015  and  laboratory  activities  were  carried  out  at 
veterinary medicine microbiology  laboratory, Jigjiga University. The 
study samples were collected from different food establishments of 
the  city.  Sample  size  was  determined  f r o m   2 5 6   f o o d  
e s t a b l i s h m e n t s   using  prevalence rate of 50%, there was no 
other  baseline  to  determine  the  prevalence  at  5%  level  of 
significance  and  the  following  formula  was  employed  (Yemane, 
1967): 
 

 

 
Based  on  the  above  formula,  the  calculated  sample  size  was 
120.  A  total  of  120  food  establishments  and  6  food  types 
were  randomly s e l e c t e d  and included in    this  study.  All  the

recommended 

 
 
 
 
samples including 20 kikil, 20 mahberawi, 20 beyayinet, 20 tibs, 
20  minchet  and  20  keywet  were  collected  for  the  detection  o f  
Salmonella. The ready-to-eat food specimens w er e   collected in 
a  clean  sterile  aluminum 
the  kitchen. 
Approximately  25  g  of  ready-to-eat  food  was  collected  in  a 
sterile  aluminum  foil.  The  samples  were  transported  using  an 
ice  box  and  analyzed  at  veterinary  medicine  microbiology 
laboratory, Jigjiga University. 
 
 
Isolation and identification of Salmonella 
 
The  isolation  and  identification  of  Salmonella  were  performed 
using 
International 
Organizations  for  Standardization 
(ISO-6579,  2000),  and 
those  supported  by 
the  Global  Salmonella  Surveillance 
(GSS)  and  National  Health  Services  for  Wales  (NHS)  (HPA, 
2008).  The  isolation  and  identification  i n v o l v e s   three  steps;  To 
test  for  the  presence  of  Salmonella,  25  mm3  of  each  sample  was 
aseptically  transferred  into  sterile  flask  containing  225  ml  buffered 
peptone  water  (BPW),  homogenized  for  5  min  and  then  incubated 
at 37°C for 24 h for recovery and proliferation  of cells which might 
be  injured  during  processing  or  to  make  the  number  of  target 
organisms  grow 
the  BPW 
enrichment, the secondary enrichment broth namely the Rappaport 
Vassiliadis enrichment broth was used  since the selective property 
of this broth lies in its ability to inhibit non-targeted microorganisms 
like  Gram  positive  bacteria  and  coliforms  and  permits  the  rapid 
multiplication  of  Salmonella.  After  pre-enrichment  in  buffered 
peptone water, 1 ml of culture from the buffered peptone water was 
transferred  into  10  ml  of  Rappaport  Vassiliadis  broth  and  was 
incubated  at  43°C  for  48  h.  Solid  media  such  as  Salmonella–
Shigella  agar,  xylose  lysine  desocholate  (XLD)  agar  and  Brilliant 
green  modified  agar  were  used  for  plating  purpose.  A  loopful  of 
culture  from  the  Rappaport  Vassiliadis  broth  were  streaked  onto 
each  of  the  solid  medium  and  incubated  at  37°C  for  18  h. 
Characteristic  colonies  from  each  selective  agar  were  picked, 
further purified and tested biochemically.

All  suspected  non-lactose  fermenting  bacterial  colonies,  picked 
from  Salmonella-Shigella  (SS)  agar,  XLD  agar  or  Brilliant  green 
modified  agar,  were  inoculated  into  the  following  biochemical  tube 
for identification: triple sugar iron (TSI) agar, Simmon’s citrate agar, 
sulphide  indole  motility  (SIM)  medium,  lysine  iron  agar,  urea  agar, 
and fermentation of glucose, sucrose and mannitol.  
 
 
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing 
 
The  antimicrobial  susceptibility  patterns  of  Salmonella  spp.  were 
carried  out  following  the  Kirby–Bauer  disc  diffusion  method  on 
Mueller-Hinton agar plates (Oxoid) as described by the Clinical and 
Laboratory  Standards  Institute  (CLSI,  formerly  NCCLS)  guidelines 
(NCCLS,  2002).  Antimicrobial  susceptibility  testing  for  Salmonella 
spp was performed using the disk diffusion method  at 37°C for 16-
18  h  and  results  were  interpreted  using  the  criteria  of  the  National 
Committee  for  Clinical  Laboratory  Standards.  Escherichia  coli 
ATCC  25922  was  used  as  a  quality  control  organism  for  the 
criterion for selection of the antimicrobial agents was based on the 
availability and current use of these antibiotics for treating infectious

RESULTS 
 
From a total of 120 samples examined, 25 (20.8%) meals 
from  food  establishments  were  found  to  be  positive  to 
Salmonella  spp.  (Table  1).  Moreover,  Salmonella  spp. 
were isolated from 6 (30%) beyayinet, 3 (15%) keywet, 5 
(25%) kikil and 9 (45%) of mahberawi, none of tibs and 2 
(10%)  of  minchet.  The 
isolation  of 
Salmonella  spp.  differed  among  the  food  types  and  it 
ranged  from  0  (tibs)  to  45%  (mahberawi)  (Table  1).

this  study.  This  is  a  pathogenic micro-organism  at very 
low doses of infection,  and is transmitted  from  person  to 
person  but  may  also  occur  by  consumption  of 
contaminated  water  and 
including  vegetables 
that  have  received  little  or  no  heat  treatment.  Food 
may  become  contaminated  by  infected  food  handlers 
who  do  not  wash  their  hands  with  soap  after  using 
the  toilet.  Foods  can  also  become  contaminated  if  they 
are harvested from a field with sewage contamination  in  
them and  thus  the  need  for  caterers  to  ensure  they  buy 
the  raw  foods  from  reputable  suppliers. 
In  addition, 
frequent  assessing  of  the  raw  food  product  supplier  is 
encouraged. 

foods 

Salmonella  can  also  be  transmitted  by  flies.  Flies  can 
breed  in  infected  feces  and  then  contaminate  food  and 
thus  the  need  for  caterers  to  have  an  elaborate  pest 
control  program.  The  prevalence  of  Salmonella  in  foods 
was  too  high,  in  contrast  to  the  previous  studies  in 
Ethiopia.  For  instance,  Akafete  and  Haileleul  (2011)  and 
Woldemariam  et  al.  (2005)  found  that  the  prevalence  of 
Salmonella  from  goat  carcass  swab  was  8.3%  at  Modjo 
and  7.5%  at  Bishoftu,  respectively.  This  difference  could 
be  due  to  differences  in  the  hygienic  and  sanitary  prac-
tices practiced in the food establishments at Jigjiga city. 

Resistance to multiple antimicrobials (100%) which was 
observed  in  the  current  study  was  higher  than  other 
studies  conducted  in  Ethiopia.  There  are  reports  which 
shows  the  multiple  antibiotics  resistance  by  Salmonella, 
for instance, Alemayehu et al. (2002), Endrias (2004) and 
Zelalem et al. (2011) reported 52, 23.5, 44.8 and 83.3%, 
respectively  for  the  multidrug  resistance  of  Salmonella 
isolated  from  food  of  animal  sources,  animals  and 
humans,  as  well  higher  than  reports  from  elsewhere 
(Stevens et al., 2006; Khaitsa et al., 2007; Al-Bahry et al., 

2007;  Elgroud  et  al.,  2009;  Fadlalla  et  al.,  2012)  on 
multidrug resistance of  Salmonella. This difference could 
be  because,  drug-resistant  Salmonella  are  increasing 
due to the  use of antimicrobial agents in food animals at 
prophylactic doses which may promote on-farm selection 
of  antimicrobial  resistant  strains  and  markedly  increase 
the  human  health  risks  associated  with  consumption  of 
contaminated  food  products  as  stated  by  Molla  et  al. 
(2003, 2006) and Zewdu and Cornelius (2009).

rate  of  100,  66.7,  58.3  and  33.3%, 
respectively.  Similarly,  previous  reports  from  South  India 
(Suresh  et  al.,  2006),  from  Nigeria  (Akinyemia  et  al., 
2005)  and  from  Cameroon  (Akoachere  et  al.,  2009) 
indicated  a  similar  100,  over  90  and  100%,  respectively 
resistance to ampicillin. The result of the current research 
also  showed 
to 
including  ampicillin, 
commonly  used  antimicrobials 
nalidixic acid and kanamycin with resistance rate of 100, 
88  and  64%,  respectively.  However,  higher  resistance 
rate than previous reports with the exception of ampicillin 
and resistance to further drugs as well as to nalidixic acid 
with resistance rate of 56.8% was observed in this result. 
This  difference  could  be  due  to  the  increasing  rate  of 
inappropriate  utilization  of  antibiotics  which 
favors 
selection  pressure  that  increased  the  advantage  of 
maintaining resistance genes in bacteria (McGeer,  1998;

Mathew  et al., 2007). It is  as  well recognized that  recent 
resistance  additions  include  resistance  to  trimethoprim. 
The  continuing  development  of  antibiotic  resistance  may 
lead  to  sufficient  pressure  ultimately  to  restrict  the 
antibiotics  available  to  the  veterinary  profession  for 
animal  treatment  (Gracey  et  al.,  1999).  Moreover,  this 
increase antibiotic resistance, in addition to public health 
problems, may lead to economic loss in the countries due 
to loss of exporting meat and animal products and cost of 
drug  of  choice  to  treat  human  and  animals  due  to 
resistance development.  

Ciprofloxacin  showed  a  good  antimicrobial  activity 
against  these  Salmonella  isolates.  It  was  found  that  all 
the  25  (100%)  isolates  were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. 
This  result  was  comparable  to  previous  reports  by  Molla 
et al. (2006) from central part of Ethiopia among isolates 
of  sheep  and  goat  meat,  Akinyemia  et  al.  (2005)  from 
Nigeria,  from  human  isolates  and  Zelalem  et  al.  (2011), 
isolates  of  Salmonella  from  dairy  farms  in  Addis  Ababa. 
The  effectiveness  of  drugs  like  ciprofloxacin  could  be 
because  they  are  not  widely  used  in  countries  like 
Ethiopia  and  other  African  countries  (Zelalem  et  al., 
2011). In addition to this, effectiveness of this drug could 
be  because  it  is  not  well  distributed  in  all  societies  and 
not simply prescribed rather it is used as drug of choice in

ciprofloxacin  is  not  commonly  used  to  treat  animals  in

In  addition 

to 

The  currents  study  indicated  the  inevitability  of  a 
further  research  on  the  prevalence  and  antimicrobial 
susceptibility  of  Salmonella,  by  considering  it  as  a 
potential  food  borne  pathogen.  Molecular  characteri-
zation  of  the isolates with emphasis on  resistant strains 
is  also  required  to  identify  mechanisms  of  resistance. 
Moreover,  careful and  discreet  use  of  antimicrobials in 
the  health  sectors  is  mandatory  since  high  rate  of 
antimicrobial  resistant  Salmonella 
isolates  were 
identified.
