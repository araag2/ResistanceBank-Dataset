Salmonella is a leading cause of foodborne disease and is often associated with the
consumption of foods of animal origin. In this study, sixty-six Salmonella isolates were
obtained from 631 raw meat samples purchased at small retail suppliers in Hubei
Province, China. The most prevalent Salmonella serotypes were Thompson (18.2%) and
Agona (13.6%). Frequent antimicrobial resistance was observed for the sulfonamides
(43.9%), tetracycline (43.9%), and the β-lactams amoxicillin and ampicillin (36.4% for
each). Interestingly, a high incidence of resistance to cephazolin was observed in strains
of the most common serotype, S. Thompson. Class I integrons were found in 27.3%
(18/66) of the isolates and ﬁve of these integrons contained different gene cassettes
(aacA4C-arr-3-dfr2, dfrA12-aadA21, aadA2, dfrA12-aadA2, dfr17-aadA5). Additional
antimicrobial resistance genes, including blaTEM-1, blaCTX-M-65, blaCTX-M-15, qnrB, and
qnrS, were also identiﬁed among these Salmonella isolates. Results of replicon typing
and conjugation experiments revealed that an integron with qnrB and blaCTX-M-15 genes
was present on incH12 mobile plasmid in S. Thompson strain. Multilocus sequence
typing (MLST) analysis revealed 32 sequence types, indicating that these isolates were
phenotypically and genetically diverse, among which ST26 (18.2%) and ST541 (12.1%)
were the predominant sequence types. The integrons, along with multiple antimicrobial
resistance genes on mobile plasmids, are likely contributors to the dissemination of
multidrug resistance in Salmonella.

INTRODUCTION

Salmonella is an important source of foodborne disease, resulting in morbidity and mortality
worldwide (Park et al., 2015). In China, 70–80% of bacterial food poisoning cases are due to
Salmonella that originates in poultry, eggs, beef and pork (Yang et al., 2013). Direct and indirect
spread of Salmonella between animals and humans are threats to human health. Although

Incidence of Salmonella From Meat

more than 2610 serotypes of Salmonella have been identiﬁed,
the majority of human Salmonella infections are caused by
strains of only a few serotypes (Mancin et al., 2015). Therefore,
serotype determination is an important aspect of epidemiological
surveillance and disease assessment (Hung et al., 2017). Changes
in the prevalence of speciﬁc serotypes can result from the
movements of people, animals, and foods (Hendriksen et al.,
2009). At present, serotypes Enteritidis and Typhimurium have
been most frequently implicated in salmonellosis outbreaks
from foods in Taiwan, Greece, Qatar and South Africa (Chang
et al., 2016; Papadopoulos et al., 2016; Hung et al., 2017;
Smith et al., 2017).

Though not as facile or rapid as serotyping, multilocus
sequence typing (MLST) is a reliable and highly discriminatory
molecular typing method. In this technique, the phylogenetic
relationship between bacterial strains is determined based upon
nucleotide sequence variations within several housekeeping and
other conserved genes (Chang et al., 2016). MLST has many
advantages compared with other genotyping techniques (Stepan
et al., 2011). It is consistent and reproducible, and combines
nucleotide sequencing and bioinformatics with a population
genetics approach to produce accurate, reliable and highly
portable results (Smith et al., 2017). Furthermore, it has been
suggested that MLST is superior to serotyping for Salmonella
surveillance and outbreak tracking (Achtman et al., 2012).

resistance, which leads

The widespread use of antibiotics poses problems
to an increase

for
in
antimicrobial
treatment costs and even to therapy failure (Hur et al.,
2012). Multiple drug resistance (MDR) among Salmonella is
prevalent. This applies not only to traditional antimicrobials
such as sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol, but also against
clinically important antimicrobials like the third generation
β-lactams and ﬂuoroquinolones (Agada et al., 2014). The
selective pressure caused by the application of antimicrobials
in poultry production and veterinary practice for growth
promotion and prophylaxis has resulted in an increase in
antibiotic resistance and an increase in the presence of genes
conferring antimicrobial resistance to Salmonella (Zishiri et al.,
2016). The spread of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella
is primarily due to integrons (Rajaei et al., 2014). Integrons
are mobile DNA elements containing multiple antimicrobial
resistant genes, which can move from one bacterium to another.
This increases multi-drug resistance in bacterial populations
(Asgharpour et al., 2014). Among various integrons, the class I
integron is frequently observed among antimicrobial resistant
Salmonella and plays a major role in the dissemination of
resistance genes (Wright, 2010).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample Collection and Salmonella
Isolation and Serotyping
including 263
We collected 631 retail raw meat samples,
chicken meat, 102 duck meat, 80 pork and 186 ﬁsh products
from 20 small markets, in Wuhan City of Hubei Province,
China, from 2014 to 2017. All samples were transported to
our laboratory on ice within 6 h of collection. Salmonella
isolation and identiﬁcation methods were carried out according
to the standard procedures of National Food Safety Standard
Food Microbiological Examination: Salmonella (GB 4789.4-
2016). Biochemical
identiﬁcation was done using an HBI
microbial biochemical identiﬁcation kit (Hope Biotechnology,
Qingdao, China).

Serotyping of Salmonella isolates was done according to the
Kauﬀmann-White scheme using an O and H antigen slide
agglutination kit (Tianrun Biopharmaceutical, Ningbo, China)
(Zhao et al., 2017).

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the
Kirby-Bauer disk diﬀusion method as described by the Clinical
and Laboratory Standards Institute (Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute [CLSI], 2016). Antimicrobial disks (Oxoid
Ltd., Basingstoke, United Kingdom) used for testing contained
10 µg amoxicillin, 10 µg ampicillin, 30 µg cefotaxime, 30 µg
cefuroxime sodium, 30 µg cephazolin, 30 µg chloramphenicol,
5 µg ciproﬂoxacin, 30 µg nalidixic acid, 10 µg norﬂoxacin,
10 µg streptomycin, 10 µg gentamicin, 300 µg nitrofurantoin,
300 µg sulfonamide and 30 µg tetracycline. Escherichia coli strain
ATCC 25922 was used as a reference strain. The standard break
points were interpreted according to the guidelines of the Clinical
and Laboratory Standards Institute (Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute [CLSI], 2016).

Antimicrobial Resistance Genes and
Class I Integron Identiﬁcation
Bacterial DNA was extracted from Salmonella isolates cultured
overnight in Luria–Bertani broth using the MiniBEST Bacteria
Genomic DNA Extraction Kit Ver.3.0 (Takara, Beijing, China),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Eighteen genes
known to be associated with resistance to the antibiotics as well
as Class I integrons were tested by PCR using the oligonucleotide
primers listed in Table 1. The PCRs were carried out using a
MyCyler Thermocycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA, United States) in
a 25 µL mixture that contained 0.5 mM of each primer, 1 × PCR
buﬀer (Takara), 250 µM of dNTP, 0.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase
(Takara), 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 µL of template DNA. The
cycling conditions were 94◦C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles
of 94◦C for 30 s, 54–61◦C for 30 s and 72◦C for 1 min, and a
ﬁnal extension of 72◦C for 10 min. PCR ampliﬁcation products
were separated on agarose gels and the DNA was puriﬁed from
agarose plugs using the Takara Agarose Gel DNA Puriﬁcation Kit
(Takara). BGI Tech Solutions (Wuhan, China) performed DNA

To the best of our knowledge, there is limited information
regarding the incidence of Salmonella in retail raw meat products
in Central China. Therefore, the objective of this study was to
determine the prevalence, serotype distribution, genetic diversity,
antimicrobial resistance, and the presence of class I integrons of
Salmonella from retail raw meat products in Hubei Province,
China. This data can be used for quantitative risk assessments
of Salmonella isolates in retail meat and to help establish a
series of prevention and control measures against foodborne
pathogenic bacteria.

Conjugation Experiments
To determine whether resistance determinants were present in
transferable genetic elements in Salmonella isolates, conjugation
experiments were carried out using the broth mating method
as previously described (Olsen et al., 2004). The Salmonella
isolates positive for blaCTX-M and/or integrons served as donors,
and E. coli C600 was used as a recipient. Transconjugants

containing 750 µg/ml

were selected on Mueller–Hinton agar (Beijing Land Bridge
Technology Co., Ltd.),
rifampin
and 100 µg/ml ampicillin. Susceptibility patterns of
the
transconjugants were determined by the methods described
above. Co-transfer of resistance determinants was identiﬁed
by amplifying the relevant genes from the transconjugants
by PCR and determining the nucleotide sequencing of the
PCR products. Plasmid DNA from transconjugants and
donor
strains was extracted utilizing a Tiangen Plasmid
Puriﬁcation Mini Kit (Tiangen Biotech, China) according to

according to the MLST scheme.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Salmonella Serotype Prevalence Among
the Animal Products
Out of the 631 meat samples, 66 (10.5%) tested positive for
Salmonella, and chicken had the highest prevalence (14.8%;
39/263), followed by duck meat (11.8%; 12/102), pork (8.8%;
7/80), and ﬁsh (4.3%; 8/186).

A total of 19 serotypes were identiﬁed among 66 Salmonella
isolates and one isolate from chicken was un-typeable (Table 2).
The 19 serotypes included 11 from chicken, and 8, 5, and
6 from duck meat, pork and ﬁsh, respectively. S. Thompson
was the serotype most frequently identiﬁed (18.2%; 12/66),
followed by S. Agona (13.6%; 9/66), S. Takoradi (12.1%; 8/66),
and S. Typhimurium (10.6%; 7/66). S. Thompson was not
isolated from pork but it was the most common serotype
isolated from both duck meat and ﬁsh with 33.3% (4/12) and
37.5% (3/8), respectively. Although S. Thompson was the most
prevalent serotype overall and chicken was the most likely to be
contaminated with Salmonella, S. Thompson was not the most
common serotype isolated from chicken. Both S. Agona and
S. Takoradi were isolated from chicken at a higher rate (20.5%;
8/39 for each of the two serotypes) than S. Thompson (12.8%;
5/39) (Table 2).

Salmonella is a major cause of foodborne illness worldwide.
In this study, Salmonella were recovered from retail raw meat
products in Hubei Provence, China. The overall prevalence of
Salmonella in retail meat products sampled in this study (10.5%)
agreed with that reported in Henan Province, China (9.7%) (Yu
et al., 2014) but was higher than that reported from Xinjiang,
China (6.8%) (Yin et al., 2016). However, a simple conclusion
could not be made from direct comparisons among studies due to
regional diﬀerences, sampling seasons and the types of products
sampled. In this study, the higher contamination rate found
may be related to fewer biosecurity and hygiene measures inside
these small markets.

We also identiﬁed 19 serotypes among the 66 isolates.
The most common serotype in retail raw meat products
was S. Thompson. While this result was consistent to two
previous studies conducted in Iran (Soltan-Dallal et al., 2010;
Sodagari et al., 2015), it diﬀered from other reports in which
the dominant serotype was S. Hadar in Xinjiang, China
(Yin et al., 2016), S. Enteritidis in Henan Province, China

S. Agona, S. Typhimurium, S. Enteritidis, S. Kentucky, and
S. Derby, which have all been previously found in food
products (Ma¸ka et al., 2014; Shah et al., 2017; Wang et al.,
2017). The diﬀerences in dominant serotypes may be due
to geographical diﬀerences, sample types or seasons and
serotype pathogenicity.

ampicillin (36.4%),

Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Among 66 Salmonella isolates, a high percentage of the isolates
were resistant to sulfonamides (43.9%), tetracycline (43.9%),
amoxicillin (36.4%),
chloramphenicol
(27.3%), nalidixic acid (21.2%), streptomycin (18.2%), and
cephazolin (15.2%) (Table 3). It was found that 17 (25.8%) of the
66 isolates were resistant to 1 antibiotic, 10 isolates (15.2%) were
resistant to 2–3 antibiotics, 20 isolates (30.3%) were resistant to
4–6 antibiotics, 3 isolates (4.5%) were resistant to 7–9 antibiotics
and a single isolate (1.5%) was resistant
to 11 antibiotics
(Table 4). Thus, 51 of the 66 Salmonella isolates (77.3%) were
resistant to at least one antibiotic. Salmonella isolated from
chicken were most likely to be resistant with 92.3% (36/39) of the
isolates showing resistance to at least one antibiotic, and a single
isolate exhibiting resistance to 11 antibiotics. Salmonella isolates
from ﬁsh were the most susceptible to the antimicrobials tested
with only 2 strains (25%) showing any resistance (Table 4).

The increasing frequency of antimicrobial resistance among
Salmonella has become an emerging challenge to public health.

Our results indicated that 30.3% of
isolates were resistant
to 4–6 antimicrobial agents and 4.5% were resistant to 7–9
antimicrobials. This indicated that antimicrobial resistance
among Salmonella isolates from retail meat in Hubei Province
was lower than that in other areas of China (Zhu et al., 2014;
Wang et al., 2017). In our study, the highest rates of antimicrobial
resistance were to the sulfonamides, tetracycline, amoxicillin,
ampicillin and chloramphenicol. These results were consistent
to studies from other regions in China and other countries
(Ma¸ka et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2014; Abdi et al., 2017). The
reasons for this may lie in the continuous and extensive use of
these antimicrobials in food animals for disease treatment and
growth promotion.

Cephalosporins and ﬂuoroquinolones have been eﬀectively
used for the treatment of invasive and systemic salmonellosis
in humans and animals (Bhan et al., 2005). Our study revealed
that 15.2 and 3.0% of Salmonella isolates were resistant to ﬁrst-
generation (cephazolin) and second-generation cephalosporins
(cefuroxime), respectively, and two isolates showed intermediate
resistance
(cefotaxime)
(Table 5). Previous work has described a decreasing susceptibility
of Salmonella from retail
to these antimicrobials
(Hindermann et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2017). Interestingly,
our results indicated that a high prevalence of cephazolin
resistance was observed in isolates of S. Thompson,
the

predominant serotype. In this study, Salmonella resistance to
nalidixic acid (21.2%) was not very common, however, 31.8%
of the isolates also showed intermediate resistance to nalidixic
acid (Table 5). Only 3.0 and 1.5% of the isolates were resistant
to ciproﬂoxacin and norﬂoxacin, respectively. These rates were
lower than those reported in other studies from China (Pan et al.,
2009; Yin et al., 2016).

The Occurrence of Antimicrobial
Resistance Genes and Class I Integrons
All 66 Salmonella isolates were screened for the presence of
antimicrobial resistance genes and class 1 integrons. Numerous
oligonucleotide primer pairs (Table 1) were used to screen
the 66 Salmonella isolates by PCR for
the presence of
genes encoding resistance to chloramphenicol,
tetracycline,
sulfonamides, quinolones, and β-lactam antibiotics. Overall,
the results showed a strong correlation between antimicrobial
resistance genotypes and phenotypes (Table 5).

Among 26 β-lactam-resistant isolates in this study, four
diﬀerent β-lactamase genes were identiﬁed, including blaTEM-1,
blaCTX-M-65, blaCTX-M-15, and blaPSE−1 (Table 5). The blaTEM-1
gene had the highest occurrence (69.2%, 18/26) among β-lactam-
resistant isolates; a rate similar to that previously reported for
Salmonella isolated from meat and dairy products in Egypt
(Ahmed et al., 2014). The extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)
genes, blaCTX-M-65 and blaCTX-M-15, were each observed in
a single S. Indiana and S. Thompson isolate, respectively.
The blaPSE−1 gene was also identiﬁed in only one isolate of
S. Anatum. A cephalosporin resistant S. Thompson isolate
carried the gene encoding CTX-M-15, which is the most
prevalent ESBL worldwide (Chon et al., 2015). In this study,
the rarely observed blaCTX-M-65 was present in a ciproﬂoxacin-
and cefuroxime-resistant isolate of S. Indiana. Similarly, it was
reported that the blaCTX-M-65 gene was harbored in ciproﬂoxacin-
and cefotaxime-resistant S. Indiana isolates in Henan Province of
China (Bai et al., 2016). In addition, the blaCTX-M-65 gene was
identiﬁed previously in an outbreak of S. Infantis in Ecuador
(Cartelle Gestal et al., 2016).

The qnr family of genes encodes a pentapeptide repeat protein
that protects DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV from quinolone
and ﬂuoroquinolone inactivation. Plasmids containing qnr
can be transferred among bacteria via conjugation and
this is a very important emerging public health concern
(García-Fernández et al., 2009). Although qnr
confers only
low-level quinolone resistance, mutations in the quinolone

resistance-determining region (QRDR) could result in higher-
level resistance to ﬂuoroquinolones, especially to ciproﬂoxacin.
The existence of qnr genes has been reported in Salmonella
from other regions in China and in other countries (Yang et al.,
2013; Wasyl et al., 2014). In the current study, 62.9% (22/35)
of the 14 nalidixic acid-resistant and 21 intermediate resistant
Salmonella isolates harbored qnrB and/or qnrS genes (Table 5).
The qnrB gene was present in 34.3% (12/35) of the nalidixic acid
resistant or intermediate resistant Salmonella isolates while qnrS
was present in 31.4% (11/35) of the isolates. Both qnrB and qnrS
were found in only a single isolate of S. Enteritidis. The genes
qnrA and qnrD were not found among any of the isolates. The
blaCTX-M-15 gene was found in combination with qnrB, while the
isolate with blaCTX-M-65 carried no quinolone resistance genes.

The tetracycline resistance genes (tetA, tetB, and tetC) and
sulfonamide resistance genes (sul1, sul2, and sul3) were identiﬁed
in 86.7 and 96.9% of the strains resistant or intermediate
resistant to the cognate antibiotic. The ﬂoR gene was identiﬁed
in 40% (8/20) of chloramphenicol-resistant isolates (n = 18) and
intermediate resistant isolates (n = 2) (Table 5).

An integron is a mobile DNA element, which usually
contains one or more antimicrobial resistance genes that can be
transferred among bacteria. In this study, Class I integrons (intI1)
were found in 18 isolates (27.3%) and 13 of them did not possess
antimicrobial resistance gene cassettes. The remaining 5 intI1-
positive isolates contained ﬁve groups of resistance gene cassettes
including aacA4C-arr-3-dfr2, dfrA12-aadA21, aadA2, dfrA12-
aadA2, and dfr17-aadA5 (Table 5). Our study also indicated that
all of the class I integron-positive isolates were resistant to at least
three classes of antimicrobials. This supports the hypothesis of

the association between class I integrons and MDR in Salmonella
isolates (Abraham et al., 2016; Meng et al., 2016).

Previous investigators identiﬁed class I integrons in foodborne
Salmonella isolated in China at rates that ranged from 20 to
61% (Zhu et al., 2014; Meng et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017). In
this study, the gene cassettes aacA4C-arr-3-dfr2 from S. London
exhibited >98.0% nucleotide sequence identity to that of the
variable region of Integron In1021 from a clinical E. coli isolated
in China (accession no. KR338349), suggesting that some of
its components may have originated from other species of
Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia. The existence of class
I integrons containing genes for antimicrobial resistance in
Salmonella isolates poses a threat to public health and food safety.

Transferability of blaCTX-M Genes and
Integrons
Six Salmonella strains harboring the ESBL blaCTX-M gene
and integrons were selected as donor strains in conjugation
experiments. These donor strains were mated with an E. coli
C600 recipient strain. Four transconjugants were obtained and
characterized. PCR based replicon typing revealed that plasmids
belonging to incompatibility types H12 and N were transferred
from Salmonella to the E. coli C600 (Table 6). However, an
incA/C plasmid in a S. Indiana isolate was not transferred.
Genes present in the transconjugants included class I integrons,
blaTEM-1, blaCTX-M-65, blaCTX-M-15, qnrB, sul1, sul2, tetA, and
tetB. The co-transfer of blaCTX-M-15 and qnrB was observed
with an integron from an S. Thompson isolate to E. coli strain
C600 (Table 6). When mated with the S. London donor, the

E. coli C600 transconjugants showed an identical antimicrobial
resistance phenotype to the donor. For the other Salmonella
donors, the E. coli C600 recipients showed similar, but not
identical antimicrobial resistances (Table 6).

Of concern, the ﬁndings of conjugation tests demonstrated
the presence of genes including blaTEM-1, blaCTX-M-15, and
qnrB on mobile plasmids. These resistance genes and integron
were conjugally transferred from a Salmonella donor strain
and conferred a MDR phenotype to a naïve E. coli recipient.
Few studies have shown the co-existence of
integron with
plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants
and ESBL genes on transferable plasmids (Lai et al., 2013). It
has been suggested that the transmissible elements containing
these genes could be selected and transmitted during exposure
to any of
the antimicrobials (González and Araque, 2013;
Jiang et al., 2014).

MLST Analysis
Thirty-two STs were identiﬁed among the 66 isolates, and ST26
(n = 12) was the most common followed by ST541 (n = 8),
ST13 (n = 7), ST11 (n = 6), and ST314 (n = 5) (Table 5).
The STs in this study were correlated with speciﬁc serotypes,
such as ST11 with S. Enteritidis, ST13 with S. Agona, ST19
with S. Typhimurium, ST314 with S. Kentucky and ST26 with
S. Thompson. Though a particular ST was always associated
with the same serotype, some serotypes could be represented by
multiple STs. For example, the isolates characterized as S. Derby
belonged to ST20 and ST40.

The diversity of samples we collected was also reﬂected
in a diversity of the 32 STs that we identiﬁed. ST26 was
the most common especially among poultry samples and
this ST corresponded to S. Thompson that has a low rate
of occurrence in China (Ni et al., 2018). ST11 and ST19
were the most frequent sequence types recovered from meat
samples and these STs are commonly associated with human
salmonellosis outbreaks (Gunel et al., 2015; Ashton et al., 2016).
Additionally, our results revealed that the serotypes and STs
were highly correlated, which is consistent with previous research
(Achtman et al., 2012). We did ﬁnd sequence type diﬀerentiation
within serotypes such as with S. Typhimurium and S. Derby.

Therefore, MLST analysis provided a greater discriminatory
power than serotype determination.

CONCLUSION

This study identiﬁed S. Thompson and S. Agona as the most
common serotypes among Salmonella isolates recovered from
retail raw meat products in Hubei Province, China. Antimicrobial
resistance was prevalent and correlated well with the presence
of cognate resistance genes. Salmonella isolates containing class
I integrons showed broader antimicrobial resistance than those
without them. In addition, conjugation experiments revealed a
co-transfer of class I integron with PMQR and ESBL genes.
The reasonable use of antibiotics in livestock breeding and
management of the food supply chain is of importance to
ensure food safety.
