Abstract

Beef carcass sponge samples collected between March 2003 and August 2005 at an abattoir in Brazil were surveyed for the presence of Shiga
toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). Only one carcass among the 80 tested showed a STEC, stx2-encoding gene by PCR amplification. The
frequency of carcass contamination by E. coli during processing was tested at three situations, respectively: preevisceration, postevisceration and
postprocessing, during the rain and dry seasons. The prevalence of E. coli at the three points was of 30.0%, 70.0%, 27.5% in the rain season and of
22.5%, 55.0%, 17.5% during the dry season, respectively. The E. coli isolates exhibited a high level (45.0%) of multidrug resistance to two or
more antimicrobial agents.

1. Introduction

Escherichia coli forms part of the bacterial population of the
cattle's gastrointestinal tract. In beef carcass processing, E. coli is
regarded as an indicator of fecal contamination. Levels of E. coli
associated with cattle carcasses can increase or decrease during
processing according to factors such as the levels of
fecal contamination of live cattle, efficiency of evisceration and
hygienic practices in the abattoir. E. coli is regarded as a pathogen
of major worldwide importance in commercially produced beef,
its presence can lead to significant economic loss (Bell, 1997).
Bovine E. coli strains can produce heat labile (LT) or heat-
stable (ST) enterotoxins, Shiga-like toxins (Stx), cytotoxic
necrotizing factors (CNF1 and CNF2) and hemolysins (α-Hly
and E-Hly). Enterotoxin-producing E. coli (ETEC) has been
identified as the causative agent of several important diarrheal
diseases in animals and humans and are capable of producing

thermolabile (LT I and LT II) and thermostable (STa and STb)
enterotoxins (Butler and Clarke, 1994). LT I toxin does not
occur in bovine samples (Blanco et al., 1993), but STa enter-
otoxin is quite common in bovine cattle (Blanco et al., 1993).
CNF-producing E. coli has been isolated from animals with
enteritis (De Rycke et al., 1987) and from humans with extra-
intestinal infection (Caprioli et al., 1987); they have been rarely
found in Brazil (Salvadori et al., 2003).

Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) has been implicated as
the causative agent in several human diseases (Nataro and
Kaper, 1998; Paton and Paton, 1998), ranging from mild diar-
rhea to very severe and life-threatening conditions like the hemo-
lytic–uremic syndrome (HUS). The STEC strain most frequently
associated with clinical disease in the United States and Europe is
serotype O157:H7 (Nataro and Kaper, 1998). However several
other serotypes (O26, O103, O111, O113 and O121) are com-
monly found in association with severe disease outbreaks; in
some countries they are isolated from clinical cases more often
than O157 (Nataro and Kaper, 1998; Acheson, 2000).

Cattle, considered primary reservoirs of both O157 and
non-O157 STEC bacteria (Bettelheim, 2000), frequently carry

STEC without showing any pathological symptoms (Blanco
et al., 1997). The full list of bacterial virulence determinants
necessary for STEC's pathological effects is not known.
However, Stx is a key factor in pathogenesis (Acheson, 2000).
Two antigenically distinct classes of Shiga toxin have been
identified, Stx1 and Stx2 (Nataro and Kaper, 1998). Other
virulence factors such as intimin (eae) and hemolysin (hly A)
are thought to enhance pathogenicity, but are not required for
strains to produce severe disease,
including HUS (Bonnet
et al., 1998; Acheson, 2000).

Although antimicrobial

therapy is an important

tool for
infection treatment, resistance to antimicrobials is widespread
and a cause of great concern in veterinary medicine (Monroe
and Polk, 2000). Indeed, a close association between the use
of antimicrobial agents for the treatment of infections in
animals and the observed levels of resistance exists (Schawarz
and Chaslus-Dancia, 2001). From the human health perspec-
tive, the direct impact of antimicrobial resistance evolved from
the use of antimicrobials in the treatment of animal infections,
is not clear. Since the antimicrobials routinely used for the
treatment of infections in humans are also used in animals for
either therapy and prevention, or as growth promotion factors,
it is not easy to describe the relative contributions of animal-
derived resistant strains to human E. coli disease (Maynard
et al., 2004).

During the processing of the carcass, fecal contamination or
transfer of bacteria from the animal's hide to the carcass can
facilitate transmission of pathogenic E. coli to food supplies
(Bell, 1997; Barkocy-Gallagher et al., 2001). The objective of
this study therefore was to determine the virulence profiles and
the antimicrobial drug resistance of E. coli isolates from beef
carcasses at an abattoir in Brazil.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Carcass samples

Two hundred and forty bovine carcass samples were
collected between March 2003 and August 2005, at an abattoir
in São Paulo State, in southwestern Brazil. Samples studied
were from carcasses of 80 feedlot cattle raised at pastures.
Sampling of 20 feedlot cattle was done in four different
occasions, two in the rain season and two in the dry season.
Each sample was obtained using a Specie-Sponge (3M-Brazil)
moistened with 25 ml of Brilliant Green (BBL/Becton
Dickinson) in a stomacher bag. Sponges were wrung out as
much as possible within the bag, withdrawn and used to swab
each area. Each carcass was followed along the processing and
sampled at three different stages always at the same site of the
rump, near the anus over an area of 10 × 30 cm, delineated by a
sterile metal template, from the same half of each carcass.
Preevisceration samples were taken immediately after complete
hide removal; postevisceration samples were collected after
splitting and trimming; postprocessing samples were taken after
washing of the carcasses hanging in the cooler. All samples
were taken to the laboratory in an ice-cooled bag and kept for
12 h at room temperature.

2.2. Bacterial isolates

One hundred microliters of each sample was streaked on
MacConkey agar plates (Oxoid Ltd) and incubated at 37 °C for
24 h. Colonies showing E. coli characteristics were submitted to
Gram staining and identified by standard biochemical tests as
oxidase negative,
indole positive, Simon's citrate negative,
urease negative and hydrogen sulfide negative (Koneman et al.,
1997). The isolates were serotyped for the O serotype O157
using the O157 Latex Agglutination test kit (Oxoid, Basing-
stoke, UK). Negative strains were considered non-O157 strains.

2.3. PCR screening of samples

Bacterial strains were grown overnight in nutrient broth
(Sigma Chemical Co.) at 37 °C, were pelleted by centrifugation
at 12,000 g for 1 min, resuspended in 200 μl of sterile distilled
water and lyzed by boiling for 10 min. Lysates were centrifuged
as described above and 150 μl of the supernatants were used as
DNA template for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Wani
et al., 2003). A total of 89 E. coli isolates were subjected to
PCR; stx1, stx2 and eae genes were detected using the primers
and PCR conditions described by China et al. (1998). The
presence of LT II gene was assessed by PCR amplification using
primer pairs and conditions described by Penteado et al. (2002).
The STa gene was detected using the primer and conditions
described by Jung (1997).

2.4. Expression of E-Hly

Expression of enterohemolysin was determined based on the
method described by Beutin et al. (1989). Plates were incubated
at 37 °C for 24 h and observed for hemolysis after 3 h (for
expression of α-hemolysin) and 24 h (for E-Hly), respectively.
The reference strains used in this assay were E. coli U4–41
(positive control for α-hemolysin), E. coli 32511 (STEC O157:
H7) (positive control for E-Hly), and E. coli K12 (negative
control).

2.5. Susceptibility testing

Antimicrobial disk susceptibility tests were performed using
the disk diffusion method, as recommend by the National
Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS, 1999).
Eleven antimicrobial agents were selected for
the tests:
ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cephalotin, ceftriaxone,
tetracycline, gentamicin, streptomycin, amikacin, trimethoprim,
nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin.

3. Results and discussion

The distribution of positive carcass responses for E. coli
corresponding to each sampling season is shown in Table 1.
E. coli distribution in the three stages of the sampling, show the
same characteristics during the rain season and the dry season;
however, the number of positive carcasses obtained in the rain
season was higher than in the dry season. All isolates were

confirmed as being E. coli by their biochemical analysis and
were submitted to PCR for the detection of sequences of
virulence genes. From each MacConkey agar plate a loopful
from a confluent bacterial growth was collected and analyzed.
All isolates except one were negative for stx, eae, LT II and
STa genes by PCR analysis, as well as for enterohemolysin
expression. The only positive isolate was a stx2-encoding-
strain. Toxin-profiling studies of O157: H7 clinical isolates by
Ostroff et al. (1989) had shown that patients infected with
isolates carrying only stx2 were 6.8 times more likely to develop
severe disease than those infected with strains carrying stx1 or
both stx1 and stx2. Therefore,
isolates carrying stx2 could
represent a potential increased threat to human health.

Rogerie et al. (2001) reported a lower postprocessing of non-
O157 STEC prevalence (1.9%) on carcasses sampled during the
summer in processing plants in France. Similarly, the non-O157
STEC prevalence on carcasses processed in Hong Kong was
reported to be 1.7% (Leung et al., 2001); however, Artthur et al.
(2002) reported a high level (54.0%) of contamination with non-
O157 STEC in carcasses processed in the United States.

The hides and feces of animals presented for slaughter have
been shown to be major sources of pathogens in processing
plants (Barkocy-Gallagher et al., 2001). It is not clear what
proportion of non-O157 STEC bacteria detected in cattle feces
or on beef carcasses is able to cause disease in humans. Gyles et
al. (1998) defend the idea that all STEC bacteria could be
pathogenic under adequate circumstances.

In the present work, the detected level of STEC strains
(1.2%), matches those reported by others (Rogerie et al., 2001;
Leung et al., 2001). To the best of our knowledge, we could not
find data from Brazil for comparison. Some authors have
reported the detection of STEC strains in fecal samples of dairy
cattle (Irino et al., 2005), from diarrheic (Leomil et al., 2003)
and from mastitic cattle (Lira et al., 2004) but none from abattoir
samples. In all of them, the stx2 gene has been predominantly
found, and the non-O157 STEC strains detected. In Brazil only
a small number of O157 strains have been detected among
bovine fecal samples, 0.6% as reported by Irino et al. (2005);
they did not express the stx gene. Interestingly, the O157: H7
strains isolated in São Paulo State from human infections, were
all stx-producers (Vaz et al., 2004), predominantly presenting
the stx1 gene.

For more than four decades it has been a common practice on
farms to use antimicrobial agents for disease prevention and
growth promotion of animals. The widespread use of
antimicrobial agents would select for resistance enhancement
and may have promoted the increasing frequency of STEC
strain's multidrug resistance in bovines. This could result in
STEC population increases and perhaps greater shedding which
could lead to higher contamination of animal food products with
STEC (Zhao et al., 2001).

An E. coli colony from each positive plate was tested against
eleven antimicrobial agents. Most commonly, resistance was
observed to cephalothin (64.0%), ampicillin (35.0%) and
amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid (24.0%) and less frequently to
gentamicin (9.0%), streptomycin (11.0%) and trimethroprin
(11.0%) (Fig. 1). Twenty-four percent of the isolates were
sensible to all the antibiotics tested. Multidrug resistance was
seen in 45.0% of the isolates and resistance to 2 or 3 antibiotics
was most common among the isolates (Fig. 2). Khan et al.
(2002) reported resistance to one or more antibiotics in 49.2%
of STEC strains in India, with some strains exhibiting multidrug
resistance.

Antimicrobial resistant bacteria from animals may colonize
human population via the food chain; it is therefore possible
that resistant bacteria may be readily transferred to humans from
animals used as food sources (Van den Bogaard and Stob-
beringh, 2000).

To conclude, we report here a small

occurrence of STEC strains on beef carcasses during processing
at an abattoir in Brazil. However the E. coli isolates analyzed
showed a high level of multidrug resistance capable of causing
concern.
