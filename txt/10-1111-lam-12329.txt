Signiﬁcance and Impact of the Study: Few studies on the epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylo-
coccus aureus (MRSA) from bovine isolates have been performed in Brazil. MRSA of lineage ST398 is
worldwide spread and associated with farm animals. Multidrug-resistant MRSA-ST398 isolates were
recovered in 11% of mastitic cows from a single farm, with one isolate carrying the unusual lsa(E), spw
and aadE genes. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst detection of MRSA-ST398 isolates in milk samples of
cows with mastitis in Brazil.

Abstract

and

The objective of
this study was to analyse the prevalence and molecular
characteristics of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in milk of
cows with mastitis. The California mastitis test (CMT) was used to detect the
presence of mastitis in all 100 cows of a farm in Brazil. The CMT was positive
in milk of 115 mammary quarters from 36 cows (36%). MRSA isolates were
recovered from 4 of these 36 cows with mastitis (11%), and they were further
characterized (one MRSA/sample). The four MRSA isolates were typed as t011-
ST398-agr1-SCCmecV
pulsed-ﬁeld-
gel-electrophoresis-ApaI patterns. These four MRSA isolates showed resistance
to tetracycline, streptomycin and ciproﬂoxacin, carried the mecA, blaZ, tet(K),
and tet(M) resistance genes, and presented the S84L and S80F amino acid
substitutions in GyrA and GrlA proteins, respectively. Two ST398 isolates
exhibited resistance to gentamicin and tobramycin [with aac(6)-aph(2”) and
ant(4)-Ia genes] and one isolate resistance to clindamycin [with lnu(B) and lsa
(E) genes];
this latter isolate also carried the spectinomycin/streptomycin
resistance genes spw and aadE. MRSA of lineage ST398 is worldwide spread,
normally multidrug resistant and may be responsible for bovine mastitis. To
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst detection of MRSA-ST398 in Brazil.

Introduction

Bovine mastitis sums a signiﬁcant economic impact on the
dairy industry. Staphylococcus aureus is considered one of
the most important pathogens in bovine clinical and sub-
clinical mastitis (Kumar et al. 2011). The expression of the
mecA gene in Staph. aureus confers resistance to most of

b-lactams, including methicillin resistance (MRSA), agents
frequently used for treatment of mastitis (Sawant et al.
2005). MRSA is an important human and animal pathogen
that can be implicated in a wide diversity of infections,
including bovine mastitis (Stefani et al. 2012).

MRSA of the sequence type ST398 is considered an
important livestock-associated lineage, mainly related to

pig farming (Fluit 2012). This lineage has also been
detected as colonizers or as causative agent of infection in
other animal species, as bovine, equine, poultry and dogs
in different countries (Nemati et al. 2008; Van den Eede
et al. 2009; Floras et al. 2010; Feßler et al. 2012; Gomez-
Sanz et al. 2013), as well as in humans (Lozano et al.
2011b). However, MRSA ST398 has never been detected,
to our knowledge, in Brazil. The objective of this study
was to analyse the proportion of MRSA in milk of cows
with mastitis in a Brazilian farm and to perform the
molecular typing and the genetic characterization of the
MRSA isolates obtained.

Results and discussion

The California mastitis test (CMT) was used to detect the
presence of clinical or subclinical mastitis in all 100 cows
of a farm in Brazil and was applied to 400 samples of
milk of these animals (one milk sample per mammary
gland). The CMT was positive in 115 mammary quarters
of 36 cows (36% of cows). Milk bacterial culture from
these 115 mammary quarters yielded 32 staphylococcal
intramammary infections (IMI) coming from 18 cows.
Staph. aureus was recovered from 15 mammary quarters
from 8 cows. Among the Staph. aureus recovered, MRSA
was detected in 4 mammary quarters from 4 cows, repre-
senting 4% of cows and 111% of cows with mastitis, as
deﬁned by CMT. The four MRSA isolates (one per posi-
tive animal) were further characterized (Table 1).

The 4 MRSA isolates were typed as spa-type t011,
which is associated to lineage ST398, of clonal complex
CC398, presented the agr type I and the SCCmec type V.
The PFGE proﬁle of the strains exhibited two different
patterns (C6129 and C6130 pattern A; C5960 and C6128
isolates were negative for the
pattern B) (Table 1). All

toxin genes lukF/lukS, tst, eta and etb as well as for the
genes of the immune evasion cluster (IEC). All isolates
exhibited a multidrug-resistant phenotype (including at
least three classes of antimicrobial agents). In addition to
b-lactams, isolates showed resistance to tetracycline, strep-
tomycin and ciproﬂoxacin (100%), gentamicin and tobra-
mycin (50%), and clindamycin (25%). The resistance
genes detected in these isolates are shown in Table 1. The
genetic determinant
for streptomycin resistance (aadE)
was observed in a single strain (C6129) (Table 1). In
addition, this isolate harboured the clindamycin resistance
gene lnu(B) and the recently described lsa(E). These genes
(lsa(E), aadE and spw) were enclosed within the same
antimicrobial
cluster, which shared structural
homology to the one recently described by other authors
(Lozano et al. 2012a; Wendlandt et al. 2013a,b). Amino
acid changes in GyrA (S84L) and in GrlA (S80F) were
identiﬁed in the 4 isolates (Table 1).

gene

Few studies have detected MRSA ST398 in milk from
mastitic cows (Feßler et al. 2010; Vanderhaeghen et al.
2010). MRSA ST398 has gained special attention as colo-
nizers and causative agents of infections in pigs (Gomez-
Sanz et al.2010; Fluit 2012). Further reports have shown
that ST398 isolates are not restricted to these animals,
but can be also isolated from humans, bovines, poultry,
horses and dogs (Nemati et al. 2008; Van den Eede et al.
2009; Feßler et al. 2010; Floras et al. 2010; Lozano et al.
2011b; Fluit 2012). MRSA of this lineage is considered
an important zoonotic clone, given that
transmission
between different animal species and humans has been
suggested in numerous occasions (Lozano et al. 2011a;
Feßler et al. 2012; Fluit 2012). MRSA ST398 seems to be
an important cause of mastitis in cows of the studied
farm, as 111% of tested animals were diagnosed with
mastitis. All our MRSA ST398 isolates were ascribed to

MRSA ST398 from mastitic cows in Brazil

the spa-type
t011, widely distributed among MRSA
ST398 from pigs (Gomez-Sanz et al. 2010). In our study,
CMT was used as predictor test of clinical and subclini-
cal mastitis and only those CMT-positive milk samples
were tested for microbiological analysis. We cannot dis-
card the existence of
false-negative CMT results that
could affect the prevalence of MRSA IMI in the studied
farm. In addition, we should take into account that this
study focuses on a single herd and the true epidemiology
of MRSA-ST398
remains
unknown.

in Brazilian dairy herds

None of the strains harboured any of the virulence
genes studied, or any of the human-associated IEC genes,
which is in line with former data on MRSA isolates of
this lineage (Fluit 2012). In contrast, all
isolates were
multidrug resistant, including tetracycline resistance. Tet-
racycline resistance in MRSA ST398 has been reported as
a consequence of the intensive use of this antimicrobial
in livestock and seems to be endemic in MRSA of this
lineage (Feßler et al. 2010; Gomez-Sanz et al. 2010; Fluit
2012; Lozano et al. 2012b).

One strain contained the gene lnu(B) and the recently
characterized lsa(E), both of which confer resistance to
lincosamides (Wendlandt et al. 2013a). Interestingly, this
cluster also carried the recently characterized spw specti-
nomycin resistance gene (Wendlandt et al. 2013b). These
three genes were clustered together and their genetic envi-
ronment was identical to the one recently described in
staphylococci among Spanish MRSA ST398 isolates (Loz-
ano et al. 2012a), evidencing altogether the antimicrobial

resistance acquisition capacities of geographically distinct
MRSA ST398 isolates.

To our knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst description of
MRSA ST398 in animals in Brazil and also the ﬁrst
description in cow isolates in Latin America. A single for-
mer study has reported Staph. aureus CC398 in animals
in Latin America in pigs in Peru (Arriola et al. 2011).
In conclusion, MRSA was isolated in 4% of investi-
gated animals, corresponding to 111% of animals with
mastitis coming from a single farm. All MRSA isolates
belonged to the lineage ST398 were multidrug resistant
and lacked important virulence genes. In Brazil, epidemi-
ological studies of Staph. aureus in cattle are scarce, but
are essential to gain knowledge on the circulating lineages
responsible for cow mastitis in such milk producer coun-
try. Further surveillance on MRSA on animals should be
conducted for a better understanding on the transmission
routes of MRSA of different lineages among animals and
humans.

Materials and methods

A total of 400 milk samples from 100 cows from one
farm using milking technology (machine-milked cows) in
the State of S~ao Paulo (Brazil) was evaluated (one milk
sample per mammary gland). The California mastitis test
(CMT) was used for the diagnosis of clinical and subclini-
cal mastitis (Schalm and Noorlander 1957). A single
aseptic milk sample (20 ml) was collected from all
CMT-positive quarters after udder preparation by the

farm personnel. The milk samples were collected accord-
ing to NMC procedures
for collecting milk samples
(http://www.nmconline.org/sampling.htm), prior to rou-
tine milk-out. Mastitis was considered when at least one
of the 4 milk samples obtained from a cow was positive
by CMT, and all CMT-positive milk samples were further
studied for Staph. aureus recovery.

Milk samples of mastitic cows were plated on blood
agar 5%, incubated at 37°C and readings were taken after
24, 48 and 72 h of
incubation. Characteristic colonies
were preliminary identiﬁed using Gram staining, catalase,
coagulase and DNase tests. Susceptibility to oxacillin and
cefoxitin was tested by the disc-diffusion agar method
(EUCAST 2014). Molecular identiﬁcation of Staph. aureus
(nuc gene) and detection of the methicillin-resistant gene
mecA was performed by a multiplex PCR (Gomez-Sanz
et al. 2010).

All MRSA isolates were characterized by agr-allotype,
spa-typing, determination of staphylococcal cassette chro-
mosome mec (SCCmec) and multilocus sequence typing
(MLST), by speciﬁc PCRs and subsequent sequencing
(Shopsin et al. 2003; http://spaserver.ridom.de; IWG-SCC,
2009; www.mlst.net). In addition, pulsed-ﬁeld-gel-electro-
phoresis (PFGE) of genomic DNA of MRSA strains, previ-
ous digestion with ApaI enzyme, was carried out applying
the HARMONY protocol guidelines (Murchan et al. 2003)
and with switching times of electrophoresis for ApaI
digests as those implemented by Kadlec et al. (2009).

The presence of the genes encoding the Panton-Valen-
toxic-shock-syndrome-toxin
tine-leukocidin (lukF/lukS),
(tst), and exfoliative-toxin A (eta) and B (etb) was analy-
sed by PCR (Jarraud et al. 2002). The presence of the
genes of the immune evasion cluster (IEC) was analysed
as previously recommended (van Wamel et al. 2006)
(Table 2).

Susceptibility testing to penicillin, tetracycline, erythro-
mycin, clindamycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, streptomy-
cin,
trimethoprim-sulphametoxazole, ciproﬂoxacin and
chloramphenicol was performed by the disc-diffusion agar
method (EUCAST 2014). The presence of 16 antimicro-
bial resistance genes [mecA, blaZ, tet(K), tet(M), tet(L),
)-aph(2”), ant4, aadE, ant3(9), str, lnu(A), lnu(B),
aac(6
lnu(C), vga(A), vga(C) and lsa(E)] was investigated by
speciﬁc PCRs (Gomez-Sanz et al. 2010; Lozano et al.
2012a; Wendlandt et al. 2013a,b), and in some cases also
by sequencing [(lnu(B),
lsa(E)]. The presence of amino
acid changes in GyrA and GrlA proteins was investigated
by PCR and sequencing (gyrA, grlA). In addition, map-
ping PCR was implemented to detect the antimicrobial
resistance gene cluster lnu(B)-lsa(E)-spw-aadE (Lozano
et al. 2012a; Wendlandt et al. 2013a,b). Positive and neg-
ative controls from the collection of the University of La
Rioja were used in all PCRs.
