Abstract

Escherichia coli strains such as Shiga toxin–producing E. coli (STEC), enteropathogenic E. coli, en-
terotoxigenic, attaching, and effacing E. coli, and enteroinvasive E. coli cause diarrhea in humans. Although
other serotypes exist, the most commonly reported STEC in outbreaks is O157:H7. A cross-sectional study was
conducted to isolate and characterize non-sorbitol–fermenting (NSF) E. coli O157:H7 from urban and periurban
livestock settings of Morogoro, Tanzania. Human stool, cattle feces, and soil and water samples were collected.
Observations and questionnaire interview studies were used to gather information about cattle and manure
management practices in the study area. E. coli were isolated on sorbitol MacConkey agar and characterized by
conventional biochemical tests. Out of 1049 samples, 143 (13.7%) yielded NSF E. coli. Serological and
antimicrobial tests and molecular typing were performed to NSF E. coli isolates. These procedures detected 10
(7%) pathogenic E. coli including STEC (n = 7), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) (n = 2), and attaching and
effacing E. coli (A/EEC) (n = 1) strains. The STEC strains had the ability to produce VT1 and different VT2
toxin subtypes that caused cytopathic effects on Vero cells. The prevalence of STEC in cattle was 1.6%, out of
which 0.9% was serotype O157:H7 and the overall prevalence of diarrheagenic E. coli in cattle was 2.2%. The
serotypes O157:H7, O142:H34, O113:H21, O + :H - , O + :H16, and O25:H4 were identiﬁed. One ESBL-
producing isolate showed the MLST type ST131. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst ﬁnding in Tanzania of this
recently emerged worldwide pandemic clonal group, causing widespread antimicrobial-resistant infections, and
adds knowledge of the geographical distribution of ST131. Cattle manure was indiscriminately deposited within
residential areas, and there was direct contact between humans and cattle feces during manure handling. Cattle
and manure management practices expose humans, animals, and the environment to pathogenic E. coli and
other manure-borne pathogens. Therefore, there is a need to improve manure management practices in urban
and periurban areas to prevent pathogen spread and associated human health risks.

Introduction

D iarrheagenic Escherichia coli,

such as entero-
toxigenic E. coli (ETEC), Shiga toxin–producing E. coli
(STEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), enteropathogenic

E. coli (EPEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), diffusely ad-
herent E. coli (DAEC), and extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli
(ExPEC) cause different intestinal and extraintestinal dis-
eases in humans (Nataro and Kaper 1998, Kaper et al. 2004,
Caprioli et al. 2005), including diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis,

or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), especially in children
and the elderly (Dundas et al. 2001).

Once referred to as a rare serotype (Riley et al. 1983), non-
sorbitol–fermenting (NSF) STEC O157:H7 is now a public
health problem worldwide (Caprioli et al. 2005). STEC
O157:H7 typically causes hemorrhagic colitis characterized
by severe abdominal pain, watery diarrhea preceding bloody
diarrhea, and little or no fever (Germani et al. 1997). About
2–15% of STEC O157:H7 infections progress to HUS char-
acterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal
failure (Fitzpatrick 1999, Dundas et al. 2001). Both sporadic
cases and epidemic diseases associated with STEC O157:H7
have been reported (Sang et al. 1996, Crump et al. 2002).

Hosts and sources of STEC O157:H7 are diverse and in-
clude cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, water buffalo, deer, horse,
dogs, rabbits, gulls, pigeons, chicken, meat, milk, poultry and
ﬁsh products, vegetables, and water (Caprioli et al. 2005,
Ferens and Hovde 2011). Cattle are the main reservoir
(Chase-Topping et al. 2008) and have been associated with
several cases of human infection (Aspa´n and Eriksson 2012).
Adult cattle are tolerant to infection due to lack of vascular
receptors for the Shiga toxins produced by STEC O157:H7
(Pruimboom-Brees et al. 2000), whereas ileocolitis in calves
following experimental
infection is fatal (Dean-Nystrom
et al. 1998). Transmission of STEC O157:H7 to humans
occurs through the fecal–oral route following ingestion of
contaminated food or water (Tuttle et al. 1999, Olsen et al.
2002) or direct contact with contaminated surfaces or animals
(Crump et al. 2002).

Urban areas are city areas characterized by a dense human
population of mixed age, sex, family and household structure,
ethnic, cultural, religious diversity, educational and income
levels, and high built-up area with technological and eco-
nomic advancement. Between the urban and the rural lies a
zone of gradual transition from urban to rural, called the
periurban area (Simon et al. 2004). Urban and periurban
livestock farming is expanding in developing countries pri-
marily due to high demand for animal protein to serve rapidly
growing urban populations, but also to generate household
income (Mlozi 1997). In Tanzania, there is an increase in
both the number of cattle and households engaged in cattle
keeping, with such households located in close proximity to
households not keeping cattle. Thus, cattle and other live-
stock manure is deposited indiscriminately in and on the
fringes of cities and contaminates the external environment,
e.g., cattle defecate when taken around during the day for
feeding or when manure is poorly managed at the household
level (Lupindu et al. 2012). However, in contrast to well-
known health risks associated with poor management of
human excreta, little is known about health risks associated
with livestock keeping and manure management in urban
areas.

The present study, therefore, aimed to estimate the prev-
alence of NSF STEC O157:H7and other NSF E. coli in cattle,
humans, and the associated environment of the municipality
of Morogoro, Tanzania.

Materials and Methods

Selection of study subjects and sample collection

The study included smallholder cattle keeping and non-
cattle–keeping households of urban and periurban areas of

Morogoro municipality, Tanzania. The urban area of Mor-
ogoro includes densely populated residential, commercial,
industrial, and administrative areas where cattle are also kept.
The periurban area lies adjacent to and separates the urban
area of Morogoro from the rural settings. It is characterized
by dense human population, small cattle herds, and limited
crop growing on the urban interface and gradually changes
into sparse population, big cattle herds, extensive crop ﬁelds,
and bushes toward the rural boarder. There is no clearcut
demarcation between urban and periurban settings. A herd of
cattle belonging to a household was regarded as a cluster. To
establish the prevalence of NSF STEC O157:H7, the number
of clusters was calculated (Bennett et al. 1991) and adjusted
as the population of clusters from which the sample was
drawn was small (Thrusﬁeld 1995). An estimated prevalence
(P) of NSF STEC O157:H7 was set at 50% (Thrusﬁeld 1995),
the intracluster correlation coefﬁcient (q) at 0.2 (Otte and
Gumm 1997), and the signiﬁcance level at 5%. The average
number of cattle in a cluster was found to be ﬁve during a
preliminary survey and thus used in calculation of the number
of clusters. One hundred cattle-keeping households, who kept
446 cattle in total, were randomly selected from a sampling
frame of 367 households and matched to their respective non-
cattle–keeping neighbors living within a radius of 100 me-
ters. Face-to-face interviews with household leaders using a
structured questionnaire were used to gather information
regarding cattle and manure management. Further informa-
tion was collected by observations made around the house-
holds. Stools from one member of a cattle-keeping household
involved in cattle and manure management and any member
from a non-cattle–keeping household were collected early in
the morning following prior notiﬁcation and provision of a
stool collection container the preceding evening. Water and
soil samples were collected from the household the same
morning that stool was collected. Soil samples (2–5 cm of top
soil) were collected from ﬁve different locations of the
household premises and mixed to form a pooled soil sample
of about 100 grams. Surface water, such as borehole or pond,
or any other available water source for human and/or cattle
consumption at the household level was collected in sterile
250-mL bottles for isolation of E. coli. Individual fecal
samples of 100–150 grams were collected by hand from the
rectum using a disposable plastic glove from all cattle kept in
a household. All samples were immediately placed in an
insulated box with cooling elements and transported to the
laboratory where bacteriological analysis was initiated. Some
samples were kept overnight at 4–5°C for analysis the fol-
lowing day, with such samples being stored for a maximum
of 24 h. A total of 200 human stool, 200 soil, 200 water, and
446 fecal samples from cattle were collected for E. coli
analysis between December, 2010, and February, 2012.

Isolation of E. coli

One gram of stool, soil, and feces and 1 mL of water
sample were mixed with 4 mL of normal saline (0.9% NaCl)
to form a sample suspension. One milliliter of the sample
suspension was enriched by incubation at 37°C for 24 h in
4 mL of brain infusion broth (CM0225, Oxoid, Hampshire,
UK). Sample enrichments were subcultured onto Sorbitol
MacConkey agar (CM0813, Oxoid) supplemented with ce-
fexime-tellurite (SR0172E, Oxoid) and incubated at 37°C for

24 h. Medium sized, round, smooth, colorless (NSF) colonies
were checked for purity after subculture onto blood agar
plates and then tested for lactose fermentation on Mac-
Conkey agar (M082-500G, Himedia, Mumbai, India), b-
glucuronidase and b-galactosidase activities on Brilliance
E. coli agar (CM1046, Oxoid), and tryptophanase activity in
the indole test.

All NSF E. coli isolates were subsequently tested for the
presence of O157 somatic antigen by agglutination test using
a Wellcolex E. coli O157 kit (Remel Europe Ltd., UK) ac-
cording to manufacturer’s instruction.

Detection of diarrheagenic E. coli

Multiplex PCR for diarrheagenic E. coli was done for all
NSF E. coli isolates using a diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC) PCR
kit (SSI Diagnostica, Hillerød, Denmark, 2011) to check for
presence of the following genes: intimin gene (eae) with
amplicon size 377 bp; verocytotoxin 1 (vtx1) with amplicon
size 260 bp; verocytotoxin 2 (vtx2) with amplicon size
420 bp; heat-stable enterotoxin, human variant (estA-human)
with amplicon size 151 bp; heat-stable enterotoxin, porcine
variant (estA-porcine) with amplicon size 160 bp; heat-labile
enterotoxin (eltA) with amplicon size 479 bp; invasive plas-
mid antigen (ipaH) with amplicon size 647 bp; and 16S
rDNA genes with amplicon size 1062 bp. The latter gene
served as a positive PCR internal control. Template DNA
preparation, PCR master mix and PCR reaction volume were
prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR
ampliﬁcation was run in a thermocycler at the following
conditions: Initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 min followed by
35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 50 s, annealing at 62°C
for 40 s, and extension at 72°C for 50 s. The ﬁnal extension
was done at 72°C for 3 min. For each sample and the controls,
18 lL of PCR product was run in separate wells on 2%
agarose gel at 125 V for 1 h followed by staining in ethidium
bromide (SSI-Diagnostica 2011). STEC isolates were sub-
typed by PCR for vtx1 and vtx2 genes (Scheutz et al. 2012).
Vero cell cytotoxicity assay was performed for all isolates
positive for virulence genes to test for cytopathic effects on
Vero cell monolayers (Scheutz 1997).

Strains found to harbor virulence genes in the DEC PCR
were conﬁrmed by dot-blot DNA hybridization and tested for
additional virulence genes at the Statens Serum Institut,
Denmark. DNA probes included vtx1, vtx2, eae, ehxA, EAF,
bfpA, saa, astA, and vtx2f. Isolates were allowed to grow on
the nylon membrane positioned on top of an agar plate. The
colonies were lysed, denatured, and neutralized using stan-
dard conditions and then hybridized (Scheutz 1997).

Serotyping of diarrheagenic E. coli

O and H antigen serotyping was performed according to
standard procedures at the Statens Serum Institut (Ørskov and
Ørskov 1984; SSI 2011). In summary, boiled cultures of
isolates were tested against pooled O antisera and single O
antisera of respective pools. Infusion broth inoculated with a
colony of isolate was incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Broth cul-
tures were boiled at 100°C for 1 h and left to cool on the table
for 1 h before use. Eighty microliters of pooled O antisera was
mixed with an equal amount of boiled culture in microtiter
plates and incubated in humid atmosphere at 50°C overnight.
A boiled culture positive for pooled O antisera was tested

with an equal amount of single O antisera and incubated at
50°C overnight. A positive reaction—agglutination covering
the bottom of microtiter well—was read against artiﬁcial
light on a black background.

For H antigen typing, one colony from agar medium was
inoculated in semisolid medium and incubated at 37°C.
Motile cultures were passed to another semisolid medium
using a Pasteur pipette and incubated overnight at 37°C.
Cultures were further passed to nutrient beef broth, incubated
at 37°C for 6 h in a roller device, and ﬁxed with formaldehyde
0.5%. Pooled H antiserum (180 mL) was mixed with an equal
amount of ﬁxed culture in a glass tube. The reaction was read
after 2 h incubation of the mixture at 50°C. Positive ﬁxed
cultures were tested with an equal amount of single H antisera
of the respective H pool. A positive agglutination reaction
was ﬂuffy.

Antimicrobial susceptibility test

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of all NSF E. coli
isolates was determined by the disc diffusion method ac-
cording to standards of the Clinical Laboratory Standard
Institute (CLSI 2008). The following discs (Oxoid, UK) were
used: Amoxillin (30 lg), ampicillin (10 lg), sulfamethazole/
trimethoprim (25 lg),
tetracycline (30 lg), ciproﬂoxacin
(5 lg), gentamicin (10 lg), streptomycin (10 lg), and cefo-
taxime (30 lg). Fresh colony suspension, equivalent to 0.5
McFarland standards, was tested against the antimicrobial
discs on Mueller–Hinton agar, and the diameters of the zone
of complete inhibition were read after 18 h of 37°C incuba-
tion. Isolates were also tested for presence of extended
spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) genes for the TEM, SHV,
OXA-10 group, and the CTX-M group 1, 2, 8, and 9 enzymes
by PCR, as previously described (Hansen et al. 2012). The
O25-ST131 clone allele-speciﬁc PCR for the paB gene was
performed as previously described (Clermont et al. 2009).

Ethical approval

The study was approved by the Tanzania National Institute
for Medical Research (NIMR) Ethical Board (NIMR/HQ/R
8a/Vol. IX/927). Conﬁdentiality of the study outcome and all
conditions for research approval were observed throughout
the study

Results and Discussion

NSF E. coli

From the total of 1046 samples analyzed, 143 (13.7%)
yielded NSF E. coli, including 95 (9.0%) isolates from cattle
feces, 33 (3.2%) from human stool, eight (0.8%) from soil,
and seven (0.7%) from water samples. Only one isolate was
selected from each sample. Four isolates (4.2%) from cattle
were positive for O157 somatic antigen. Traditionally, the
inability of E. coli O157:H7 to ferment sorbitol has been used
to differentiate them from other strains. The use of sorbitol
MacConkey agar to screen for STEC O157:H7 is reported to
miss out some nonmotile VTEC O157 strains because they
can ferment sorbitol (Karch and Bielaszewska 2001); how-
ever, recovery of STEC (including non-O157), EPEC, and A/
EEC in the present study (Table 1) illustrates that there is a
broad range of diarrheagenic E. coli that do not ferment
sorbitol.

Multiplex DEC PCR of all NSF E. coli revealed that 11
isolates (7.7%) carried at least one virulence gene (Fig. 1).
The proportion of cattle carrying NSF diarrheagenic E. coli
was 10.5%, whereas that of water samples positive for NSF
diarrheagenic E. coli was 14.3%. An amplicon was produced
for 16S rDNA in all tested isolates except for the negative
control, conﬁrming that the PCR was done correctly. The
results from the multiplex DEC PCR, DNA hybridization,
and O:H serotyping of the NSF E. coli are shown in Table 1.
Isolates contained either one or a combination of vtx1, vtx2,
eae, ehxA, EAF, bfpA and astA genes. Four isolates carried
both eae and vtx2 genes, two isolates carried vtx1 and vtx2,
and two isolates carried EAF and bfpA genes. Six out of 11
diarrheagenic E. coli isolates had cytotoxic effects on Vero
cells (Table 2). The O157:H7 was the most commonly iso-
lated serotype (four isolates), while other isolates were
O113:H21, O142:H34, O + :H - , and O + :H16. One STEC
isolate was nonmotile and two isolates had an O antigen that
could not be determined (Table 1). The vtx subtypes were
dominated by vtx2c (ﬁve out of seven isolates) (Table 2).
Three bovine isolates had more than one subtype of the vtx
gene, while one isolate contained three vtx subtype genes
(Table 2).

Occurrence of genes vtx1, vtx2, eae, ehxA, and astA in
different combinations and the cytopathic effect of isolate
extracts on Vero cells suggest that these isolates can cause
disease in humans (Boerlin et al. 1999, Blanco et al. 2003,
Caprioli et al. 2005). Different vtx2 subtypes were found in
the current study, a ﬁnding also reported earlier (Scheutz
et al. 2001). Virulence genes eae and vtx2 have been more
often associated with serotypes reported from human dis-
eases than vtx1 (Boerlin et al. 1999). Moreover, speciﬁc
subtypes of vtx2 have been associated with HUS cases,
whereas other subtypes seem to be most commonly associ-
ated with uncomplicated diarrhea (Friedrich et al. 2002). Our
recovery of vtx1a, vtx2b, vtx2c, and vtx2d in different com-
binations and in some isolates in combination with the eae

gene shows that inadequate management of cattle manure
and associated human exposures may represent health risks
for people living in urban areas with livestock keeping.

Prevalence of STEC

The prevalence of STEC O157:H7 in cattle was 0.9%
[95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 0.29–2.15], whereas the
prevalence of STEC in cattle was 1.6% (95% CI 0.69–3.08).
The overall prevalence of diarrheagenic E. coli in cattle feces
was 2.2% (95% CI 0.99–3.67) and 0.5% (95% CI 0.025–2.44)
in water. Each individual diarrheagenic E. coli isolate came
from a different source, in which case nine isolates originated
from different cattle and herds and one isolate was isolated in
a water sample in a household where diarrheagenic isolates
could not be recovered from either human stool, cattle feces,
or soil samples. There may be little transmission within
clusters, but these scattered multiple sources increase the
chance of pathogen transmission to humans, animals, and the
environment in close vicinity to the clusters positive for
diarrheagenic E. coli.

The low prevalence of NSF STEC O157:H7 found in cattle
in Morogoro is similar to what has been reported in Kansas
(1.3%) (Sargeant et al. 2000) and in Washington State for
dairy cattle (0.28%), beef cattle on pasture (0.71%), and beef
cattle in feedlots (0.33%) (Hancock et al. 1994). However,
higher occurrence has been reported elsewhere in South
Africa, where 5.4–20% of cattle were positive for STEC
O157:H7 (Ateba and Bezuidenhout 2008). The prevalence of
1.6% STEC in cattle in the present study is comparable to
what has been reported in Spain in adult healthy cattle
(2.5%), but is lower than that in calves (7.9%) and heifers
(20.2%) in the same country (Orden et al. 2002). The sensi-
tivity of diarrheagenic E. coli isolation may have been neg-
atively affected by the amount of sample and the type
enrichment media used. In the present study, 1 gram of
sample was inoculated in 4 mL of nonselective enrichment

medium. However, the method used is comparable to a study
by Sargeant et al. (2000), who enriched 10 grams of sample in
90 mL of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) enrichment
broth and reported a prevalence of NSF STEC of 1.3%. On
the contrary, 20 grams of the sample enriched in 180 mL of
modiﬁed E. coli broth yielded a prevalence of 11.1%% NSF
STEC O157:H7 (Heuvelink et al. 1998).

There are no previous records for Tanzania and neigh-
boring countries of the prevalence of STEC O157:H7 in
cattle. Thus, the estimated prevalence of STEC O157:H7 was
set at 50% to maximize the sample size when the sample size
was calculated (Thrusﬁeld 1995). However, non-O157 STEC

has been isolated from both cattle and children in neighboring
Uganda (Majalija et al. 2008), and a study on E. coli
O157:H7 in human patients with diarrhea in Morogoro,
Tanzania, found that 0.7% of strains harbored vtx1 or vtx2 as
well as the eae gene (Raji et al. 2008). It remains to be in-
vestigated whether EPEC strains in cattle feces and water
sources as documented in this study may be associated with
human diseases, e.g., gastroenteritis in children due to EPEC
infection that has been reported in Dar es salaam, Tanzania,
where livestock is also kept in urban areas (Moyo et al. 2011).
Our results document for the ﬁrst time that STEC (including
E. coli O157:H7), EPEC, and A/EEC strains have been found

in cattle and water sources in Tanzania. However, if the use of
sorbitol MacConkey agar to recover NSF E. coli can detect
diarrheagenic E. coli at this rate, questions arise about the
magnitude of the prevalence of sorbitol-fermenting diar-
rheagenic E. coli and sorbitol-fermenting O25:H4, ST131 in
this environment.

Antimicrobial resistance

The diarrheagenic E. coli isolates were all susceptible to
tetra-
amoxillin, ampicillin, sulfamethazole/trimethoprim,
cycline, ciproﬂoxacin, gentamicin, streptomycin, and cefo-
taxime. However, a nondiarrheagenic isolate from human
(O25:H4) (Table 1) tested positive as O25b-ST131 by the
clone allele-speciﬁc PCR for the paB gene, which is identical
to the worldwide ESBL-producing clone and was positive for
the CTX-M-gr. 1 gene. ESBL variant TEM-63 and CTX-M-
15 have previously been isolated from blood cultures of
patients in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (Blomberg et al. 2005),
and the isolation of O25:H4, ST131 from the stool of a healthy
individual in the current study gives another dimension of
concern of resistant gene spread among the population.

Cattle and manure management practices

Cattle and manure management practices for diarrhea-
genic E. coli–positive herds are summarized in Table 3. In
general, cattle at the study sites and elsewhere in periurban
areas of Tanzania roam around, and different herds are al-
lowed to mix while foraging during daytime and are then
housed at night within residential areas. The manure accu-
mulated overnight is collected by bare hands, spades, and
wheelbarrows and disposed of as fresh manure in and around
residential areas in both households with diarrheagenic
E. coli–positive and - negative herds. The efﬂuent from the
animal house was indiscriminately discharged and leached
into the surrounding land in all nine (9%) households with
cattle positive for diarrheagenic E. coli and in 71 (71%)
households with negative herds. In all nine (9%) households
with cattle positive for diarrheagenic E. coli, humans and
cattle were found to share common water sources for drinking
purposes compared to 51 (51%) households with diarrhea-
genic E. coli–negative herds (Table 3). However, the ratio of
diarrheagenic E. coli–positive to - negative herds in each

category did not show evidence of a relation between cattle
and manure management practices and isolation of diar-
rheagenic E. coli

During grazing, cattle may have contact with other ani-
mals, including wildlife. The indiscriminate defecation on
grazing land and at household premises increases exposure
and spread of pathogens between animals, humans, and the
environment, e.g., children playing around the household
perimeter are likely to have high exposure to animal manure
through contact with contaminated soil. Manure efﬂuents are
also discharged from cattle houses, resulting in further con-
tamination of the surrounding land, with cattle keepers and
their household members being at increased risk of expo-
sure to diarrheagenic E. coli. At the study sites, cattle and
households often share sources of surface water, such as
rivers and ponds, especially during the dry season when these
are important common sources of drinking water. Close
contact between human and livestock as documented in this
study has been reported to result into sharing of nonpatho-
genic commensal bacteria between humans and different
animal species (Rwego et al. 2008). Given such interactions,
the presence of pathogenic microbes can lead to either human
or animal infection or environmental contamination. For in-
stance, outbreak of enteric infectious diseases, including
those due to E. coli O157:H7, have been reported among
people on farm visits in the United States who had direct
contact with manure from infected cattle (Crump et al. 2002,
Smith et al. 2004). However, it is uncertain to what extent the
occurrence of diarrheagenic E. coli found in cattle and in
water in the present study represents real human health
hazards. Therefore, there is a need for further research to
quantify possible risk factors for pathogen transmission from
animals or environment to animal keepers and neighboring
community in the study area and recommend appropriate
measures to safeguard public health.
