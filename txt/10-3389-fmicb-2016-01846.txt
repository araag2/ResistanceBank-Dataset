(growing crops and raising animals)
The use of antibiotics in farm management
has become a major area of concern.
Its implications is the consequent
emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and accordingly their access
into the human food chain with passage of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) to
the normal human intestinal microbiota and hence to other pathogenic bacteria
causative human disease. Therefore, we pursued in this study to unravel
the
frequency and the quinolone resistance determining region, mecA and cfr genes
of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus
(MRSA), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCNS) and methicillin-
susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (MSCNS) isolated from the retail trade of
ready-to-eat raw chicken meat samples collected during 1 year and sold across the Great
Cairo area. The 50 Staphylococcus isolated from retail raw chicken meat were analyzed
for their antibiotic resistance phenotypic proﬁle on 12 antibiotics (penicillin, oxacillin,
methicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, erythromycin, tetracycline, clindamycin, gentamicin,
ciproﬂoxacin, chloramphenicol, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and vancomycin) and
their endorsement of the quinolone resistance determining region, mecA and cfr genes.
The isolation results revealed 50 isolates, CPS (14) and CNS (36), representing ten
species (S. aureus, S. hyicus, S. epidermedius, S.
lugdunensis, S. haemolyticus,
S. hominus, S. schleiferi, S. cohnii, S. intermedius, and S. lentus). Twenty seven
isolates were methicillin-resistant. Out of the characterized 50 staphylococcal isolates,
three were MRSA but only 2/3 carried the mecA gene. The ARG that bestows
resistance to quinolones, β-lactams, macrolides,
lincosamides, and streptogramin
in MRSA and MR-CNS were perceived. According to the available

INTRODUCTION

Globally, health-conscious consumers have declined from
consuming beef red meat which has been linked to heart
disease, to choose leaner and easy digestible meats perceiving
chicken, a white meat, to be a healthier option (Hathwar et al.,
2012). Numerous potential vehicles of transmission of foodborne
pathogens exist and commercial chicken meat has been identiﬁed
as one of the most important food vehicles for these organisms,
antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and antimicrobial resistance
genes (Phillips et al., 2004; Aarestrup and Schwarz, 2006; Verraes
et al., 2013). However, the bearing of foodborne pathogens
in poultry meat and its by-products is a disturbing issue in
the poultry industry due to its impact on public health and
a challenge to the medical and veterinary oﬃcials worldwide
(APUA, 2010a; Ruban and Fairoze, 2011). Epidemiologically,
poultry meat is of paramount importance and still inculpated
as prime source of human food poisoning (Kadariya et al.,
2014). Although speciﬁc data on the burden of foodborne
disease associated with Staphylococcus in poultry meat has been
previously limited (Capita et al., 2002; Pesavento et al., 2007;
Persoons et al., 2009), yet it has gained importance in the last
couple of years (Bhargava et al., 2011; Hanson et al., 2011; Boost
et al., 2013; He et al., 2013; Martins et al., 2013; Momtaz et al.,
2013; Yurdakul et al., 2013; Islam et al., 2014; Khallaf et al., 2014;
Xin et al., 2014; Abdalrahman et al., 2015; Owuna et al., 2015;
Pinto et al., 2015; Bortolaia et al., 2016; Teramoto et al., 2016), it is
considered to be signiﬁcant to be a disturbing issue in the poultry
industry due to its impact on public health and a challenge to the
medical and veterinary oﬃcials worldwide (APUA, 2010a; Ruban
and Fairoze, 2011).

The Genus

is

termed as

Staphylococcus

very well-characterized
consisting of 51 species and 27 sub-species (www.bacterio.
is the most signiﬁcant
net/staphylococcus.html). S. aureus
species within this genus,
coagulase-positive-
Staphylococcus (CPS) by virtue of its versatility as a pathogen in
humans and animals in addition to its being one of the causes of
food intoxication (Jørgensen et al., 2005; Cunha, 2009). Other
Staphylococcus species, collectively termed coagulase-negative-
staphylococci (CNS), have gained importance as they have
been implicated to be responsible for a variety of opportunistic
infections in humans and animals (Vuong and Otto, 2002), their
association with nosocomial infections in neonatal intensive care
units and food poisoning in spite of the fact that, they are also not
classical food poisoning bacteria (Cortes et al., 2013; Becker et al.,
2014; Tong et al., 2015) as they are less pathogenic than S. aureus
possessing a smaller array of virulence factors (Becker et al.,
2014). Due to the ubiquity of many of the species within this

group, their clinical signiﬁcance has traditionally been dismissed,
and when isolated from clinical specimens, the bacteria have
merely been regarded as contaminants (Becker et al., 2014). This
perception is, however, changing as many species have emerged
as important causes of nosocomial infections, particularly in
relation to foreign device-related infections and infections in
immunocompromised patients (Ibrahem et al., 2009; Mathema
et al., 2009). Almost half of all the CNS species that have been
identiﬁed to date have been implicated in human infections
(Lowy, 2013) and a PubMed search on CNS results in more than
15,000 references, reﬂecting the increasing medical impact of
these bacteria (Becker et al., 2014).

The propensity for staphylococci to develop antimicrobial
resistance is a cause for great concern in both human and
veterinary medicine (Vanderhaeghen et al., 2010). Globally,
antimicrobial resistance was highlightened as a priority issue
(Davies and Davies, 2010; Acar and Moulin, 2012; WHO, 2012;
World Economic Forum, 2013; One Health Commission, 2014)
due to the increase in the public disquietness about the rampant
promulgation of antimicrobial resistant bacteria (AMRB) causing
a drop in the food supply as a result of treatment failure of the
infected livestock, in addition to curtailment on international
animal trade and human traveling. The connection between
antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance proﬁles in chicken and
human health has been reviewed by Marshall and Levy (2011)
which also included methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)
and which has been found in 12% of animal products—
beef, veal,
lamb, pork, and a variety of fowl—in Denmark
(Normanno et al., 2007; de Boer et al., 2009). The European
Food Safety Authority, the European Commission, and the
European Centre for Disease Prevention, Control (ECDC),
the U.S. National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System
(NARMS), a collaboration of the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, routinely compile
surveillance reports on antibiotic resistance in chicken from
member countries which includes in some cases methicillin-
susceptible S. aureus (MRSA). Signiﬁcant levels of resistance
are reported but the patterns vary considerably (CDDEP, 2015).
The MRSA associated with animals and its relevance to human
health has been highlighted by Pantosti (2012). Although, CNS
is recognized as technologically/hygienically very important
bacteria in food production and preservation (Hadžiosmanovi´c
et al., 2005; Šuškovi´c et al., 2010), yet its presence in food
is beyond any doubt of public health signiﬁcance due to the
possible promulgation of AMRB and antimicrobial resistant
genes (AMRG) (Zdolec et al., 2012a,b, 2013a,b; Dobrani´c et
al., 2013; Chaj˛ecka-Wierzchowska et al., 2015). In previous

decades, a continuous loss of susceptibility toward most of
the available antibiotics was recorded for CNS with a greater
tendency to develop multidrug resistance (Taponen and Pyörälä,
2009) limiting present therapies posing a great threat to the health
care system worldwide (Balaban and Rasooly, 2000; Anderson-
Berry et al., 2011; deKraker et al., 2011; Jean-Baptiste et al., 2011;
Marra et al., 2011). CNS of both animal and human origins
are believed to serve as important reservoirs of antimicrobial
resistance genes (Becker et al., 2014), which can transfer and
integrate into the S. aureus genome leading to the emergence of
new, potentially more resistant strains (Otto, 2012; Vitali et al.,
2014). The mechanisms responsible for antimicrobial resistance
in CNS are identical to those occurring in S. aureus (Livermore,
2000). Reports of methicillin-resistant strains among CNS are
challenging due to the large proportion of methicillin-resistant
strains and increasing numbers of isolates reinforcing the need to
revise their importance to food safety (Bhargava and Zhang, 2014;
Chah et al., 2014; Osman et al., 2016a,b). Therefore, screening
of these elements is important for public health and despite the
importance of such a screen, limited data are available for CNS at
the species level among the chicken retail meat.

Consequently, our endeavor was to reveal the hypothetical
implications that chicken meat may serve as a vector for the
conveyance of AMRB and AMRG to humans. Therefore,
we pursued in this study to probe the quinolone resistance
determining region that has not been formerly analyzed, the
mecA and cfr genes of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus
(MRSA),
aureus
methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCNS)
and methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci
(MSCNS) isolated from the retail trade of ready-to-eat raw
chicken meat sold in the retail market.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample Collection and Processing
Retail chicken (breasts and thighs) products (n = 100) were
collected from 20 retail supermarkets and groceries in the Great
Cairo Area during the year 2013. The purchased products at
retail were placed in sterile plastic containment (zip-seal bags)
then into ice chests with cold blocks to be immediately sent to
the Department of Poultry Diseases, Animal Health Research,
Institute, Dokki, laboratory for microbiological analyses. Upon
arrival at the laboratory, the samples were transferred aseptically
into stomacher bags with sterile tongs and weighed. Samples
weighing 205 g were hand agitated with 250 ml of sterile 0.1%
peptone broth. A 30 ml aliquot of sample wash was added to
30 ml of Baird Parker broth (2x concentration) with tellurite
enrichment in a 250 ml sterile Erlenmeyer ﬂask and incubated
at 37◦C for 18–24 h. After enrichment, 10 µl of broth was plated
onto each of ﬁve antibiotic-supplemented Baird Parker agars
with EY tellurite enrichment (BD) formulations and one un-
supplemented formulation and incubated 18–24 h for growth.
After enrichment, 10 µl was plated onto Baird Parker agar (BPA)
with EY tellurite enrichment and incubated at 35◦C 18–24 h
for growth. Ten microliter were also plated onto CHROMagar
MRSA plates and incubated at 35◦C 24–48 h and examined for

growth. Presumptive S. aureus (black colonies with clear halos on
BPA) and presumptive MRSA (mauve colonies on CHROMagar)
were initially screened using conventional methods: Gram
staining, coagulase plasma test, hemolysis, catalase production,
salt mannitol agar growth, Voges-Proskauer test, the maltose
and trehalose fermentation test, susceptibility to polymyxin B
test (300 lg, NewProv) and KOH test. Further conﬁrmation
was achieved by the API Staph kit. Individual colonies from all
positive plates were streaked for isolated colonies twice before
being frozen at −80◦C in Brucella Broth (BD) containing 20%
glycerol (Sigma). On the day of experimentation the isolates
were subcultured onto Mueller-Hinton agar, stored at 27◦C
in tryptic soy broth and fetal calf serum containing 2% yeast
extract and revitalized for phenotypic resistance testing and DNA
preparation.

Antibiotic Susceptibility Test
Antibiotic resistance of the 50 isolated Staphylococcus spp.
was examined using 12 commercial antibiotic discs and
performed by the standard disc diﬀusion method (CLSI,
2013). S. aureus ATCC 25923 was plated as a control. After
incubation at 37◦C for 24 h the diameter of
inhibition
halos around the colonies was measured. The antibiotics
used were: penicillin (10 µg), ampicillin-sulbactam (20 µg),
chloramphenicol (30 µg), ciproﬂoxacin (5 µg), erythromycin
(15 µg), tetracycline (30 µg), gentamicin (10 µg), clindamycin
(2 µg), methicillin (5 µg), oxacillin (1 µg), vancomycin
(30 µg), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (25 µg). In the
present investigation, we followed the criteria and standardized
international
terminology for deﬁning multidrug-resistant
(MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and pandrug-resistant
(PDR) in S. aureus that was created through a joint initiative
by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control
(ECDC) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) (Magiorakos et al., 2012): MDR was deﬁned as acquired
non-susceptibility to at
in three or more
antimicrobial categories (and one or more of these have to
apply: an MRSA is always considered MDR by virtue of being an
MRSA or/and non-susceptible to ≥1 agent in ≥3 antimicrobial
categories), XDR was deﬁned as non-susceptibility to at least
one agent in all but two or fewer antimicrobial categories
(non-susceptible to ≥1 agent in all but ≤2 categories) and PDR
was deﬁned as non-susceptibility to all agents in all antimicrobial
categories.

least one agent

Extraction of Staphylococcal DNA and
Ampliﬁcation of the 16S rRNA Gene,
Quinolone Resistance Determining Region,
mecA and cfr Genes by PCR
Bacterial genomic DNA was made from all 50 isolates from 2 mL
of bacterial suspension from an overnight culture in brain-heart
infusion using a protocol previously described (Bakshi et al.,
2005). The DNA pelletts were resuspended in an appropriate
volume of TE solution (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 1 mM EDTA).
Ampliﬁcation was performed from the puriﬁed genomic DNA

and a 0.2 mM concentration of each of the Staphylococcus-
genus-speciﬁc primers (16S rRNA gene) was used. An internal
control was integrated into the PCR-based assays to verify the
eﬃciency of the ampliﬁcations and to ensure that signiﬁcant PCR
inhibition was absent. Genus-speciﬁc conﬁrmation was carried
out by PCR using the primers: F: AAC TCT GTT ATT AGG GAA
GAA CA and R: CCA CCT TCC TCC GGT TTG TCA CC with
annealing temperature: 68◦C for 45 s to reveal an amplicon of
bp 756 (Zhang et al., 2004). S. aureus ATCC 43300 was used as
the positive control, while E. coli NCIMB 50034 was used as the
negative control.

The conﬁrmed staphylococci

isolates were conﬁrmed as
MRSA using PCR to detect the presence of mecA (the gold-
standard reference method for this analysis). Four additional
antimicrobial resistance genes frequently reported in S. aureus
conferring resistance in the quinolone-resistance-determining-
regions (QRDRs) responsible for quinolone resistance (gyrA,
gyrB, and grlA genes) and the cfr gene conferring resistance
to several classes of antibiotics (oxazolidinones, phenicols,
streptogramin compounds, lincosamidins, and pleuromutilins
known as the PhLOPSA phenotype) were also ampliﬁed. Gene’s
targets, primers pair, nucleotide sequences, operative protocols,
PCR ampliﬁcation was performed as described previously
(Table 1). Positive and negative controls were included with all
PCR runs performed. All PCR assay runs incorporated a reagent
control (without template DNA), positive and negative control
(Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615) processed in a fashion
similar to that of the tested isolates. Three independent PCR

ampliﬁcations were carried out with a GeneAmp PCR System
2400 (Perkin-Elmer, Weiterstadt, Germany). Two microliters of
template DNA was added to 23 µL of distilled sterile water, and
ﬁnally 25 µL of reaction mixture containing 10 mM Tris-HCl
(pH8.3), 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM deoxynucleoside
triphosphates, 1 mM of each primer and 3U of Taq polymerase
were added. The amplicons were resolved by electrophoresis on
1.5% (w/v) agarose gel in TBE buﬀer, stained with ethidium
bromide and photographed using a Polaroid Camera.

RESULTS

The prevalence and diversity of
the Staphylococcus species
isolated from the chicken meat were found to be: out of the 100
chicken meat samples, 50 Staphylococcus species were isolated,
which were further identiﬁed as, 14/50 CPS isolates diﬀerentiated
into, S. aureus (n = 3), S. hyicus (n = 10), S. intermedius (n = 1);
and 36/50 CNS isolates identiﬁed as S. epidermidis (n = 13),
S. lugdunensis (n = 15), S. hemolyticus (n = 1), S. hominus (n = 3),
S. lentus (n = 1), S. schleiferi (n = 2), and S. cohnii (n = 1).

important antimicrobials was also observed. The antimicrobial
resistance proﬁle of
the 50 isolated Staphylococcus spp to
diﬀerent antibiotics was analyzed; none of the isolates were
totally sensitive to the 12 tested antibiotics and 16/50 of the
isolates were shown to be resistant to at least 3 antibiotics
(S. lugdunensis) representing three classes. A small percentage of
the isolates (less than 50%) demonstrated resistance to oxacillin,
methicillin,
ciproﬂoxacin,
vancomycine, and tetracycline (Table 2). Also resistant to β-
lactams, such as ampicillin (6/50), penicillin (22/50), methicillin
(8/50), and oxacillin (13/50) was evident (Table 2). Forty
seven out of the ﬁfty isolates were resistant to penicillin and
tetracycline.

That Are Resistant (MR) and Susceptible to
Methicillin (MS)
Methicillin resistance in CPS and CNS was calculated to
be 64.3 and 52.8%, respectively. The antimicrobial resistance
patterns of the isolates are shown in Table 3. The resistance
ratios to clindamycin, methicillin, oxacillin, penicillin, and
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim in CPS and to clindamycin,
gentamycin, methicillin, oxacillin and penicillin in CNS were
found to be higher in the methicillin-resistant isolates compared
to those that were susceptible to methicillin (p < 0.001). The
lowest resistance ratio in the methicillin—resistant staphylococci
was detected for ciproﬂoxacin and ampicillin-sulbactam in
the CPS and to ampicillin-sulbactam, chloramphenicol and

Eight isolates showed resistance to oxacillin, undetectable by
mecA ampliﬁcation. The three S. aureus isolates were resistant to
9–10 antimicrobials (Table 4). Two unique susceptibility proﬁles

In addition, it was noticed that 49/50 Staphylococcus isolates were
MDR (non-susceptible to ≥1 agent in ≥3 antimicrobial classes)
while 1/10 of the S. hyicus did not apply to this as it was only
resistant to two classes of antibiotics although the number of
antibiotics were ﬁve (P, OX, MET, SAM, and SXT). S. lentus was
the only species to be PDR as it was resistant to the 12 antibiotics
(P, OX, MET, SAM, CN, E, DA, C, TE, VA, SXT, and CIP)
which represented nine classes and consequently, the remaining
48 Staphylococcus isolates were XDR as they were resistant to ≥1
agent in all but ≤2 classes (Table 4).

two of

the 50 Staphylococcus isolates,

Of
the CPS species
(2/3 S. aureus; 4/10 S. hyicus) were identiﬁed positive for
mecA (6/50) while six out of the seven CNS species expressed
the mecA gene (4/13 S. epidermedius; S.
lugdunensis 4/15;
S. haemolyticus 1/1; S. hominus 2/3; S. schleiferi 1/2 and
S. lentus 1/1) (Table 4). With the exception of 1/8 S. lugdunensis
isolates which was susceptible to oxacillin, mecA-positive, four
Staphylococcus isolates (3/10 S. hyicus; 1/1 S.
intermedius)
to ciproﬂoxacin, gentamicin, erythromycin,
were resistant
methicillin, oxacillin, penicillin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim,
and vancomycin (Table 4). Forty seven out of the ﬁfty isolates
(47/50) were resistant to penicillin and tetracycline, while only
one was resistant to chloramphenicol. Methicillin-resistant non-
Staphylococcus aureus (MRNSA) isolates were resistant to nine of
the 12 antimicrobials on the panel, including one to gentamicin.
Interestingly, two observations were recorded: (1) one of
the three S. aureus did not carry the mecA gene and was not
even phenotypically characterized as MRS (Table 5); and (2)
the resistance gene mecA was present in the S.
lugdunensis
isolate (1/8) and which was phenotypically characterized as
methicillin-susceptible non-Staphylococcus aureus (MSNSA) but
at the same time phenotypically oxacillin resistant (Table 4). The
resistance gene tested mecA was detected in 16/26 methicillin-
resistant non-Staphylococcus aureus (MRNSA) isolates (Table 5),
while cfr was not detected in any of the isolates (Table 4).

and one carried the gyrB gene (Table 4). The 50 isolates
of Staphylococcus species namely: aureus, hyicus, simulans,
lugdunensis, hominus, hemolyticus, epidermidis,
intermedius,
and S. sciuri were non-cfr-carriers. Our susceptibility testing
showed that, all non-cfr-carrying staphylococci (23/50) were
resistant to the 12 antibiotics tested in the present with varying
degrees. Of the 50 isolates, 40/50 isolates were gentamicin-
resistant, 37/50 were oxacillin resistant while only 16/50 were
ciproﬂoxacin-resistant. The results of antimicrobial susceptibility
testing indicated that the non-cfr-carrying CNS exhibited also
expanded resistance to antimicrobial agents other than those
included in the cfr-mediated PhLOPSA phenotype (Table 4)
[The Cfr rRNA Methyltransferase confers resistance to several
classes of antibiotics (phenicols, lincosamides, oxazolidinones,
pleuromutilins, and streptogramin A; PhLOPSA phenotype)].
It was possible to conclude that 25/34 of the MR-NSA strains

were potentially methicillin resistant. However, these results were
evidently diﬀerent from those obtained by PCR, in which the
gene mecA was detected in only 16/47 of the CNSA isolates
(Table 5).

DISCUSSION

In previous investigations, the frequency of S. aureus in the
chicken meat was found to be 33.3% in The Netherlands, 4%
in Egypt, 22.7% in Switzerland and 65% in Japan (Schraft et al.,
1992; Bakr et al., 2004; Kitai et al., 2005). The authors traced
back the source of contamination to particular slaughterhouses in
Switzerland while in Egypt poor hygienic and sanitary conditions
in addition to the contaminated butchers and meat handlers
during the process of slaughtering and evisceration of the bird
(Kluytmans et al., 1995; Kitai et al., 2005) could be the main cause
for the 50% prevalence recorded in the present investigation.

The coexistence of two subpopulations (one susceptible and
the other resistant) within a culture of staphylococci could
hinder an explicit detection of oxacillin/methicillin resistance
(Bannerman, 2003). All cells in a culture may carry the
genetic information for resistance, but only a small number
may express the resistance in vitro. This phenomenon is
termed heteroresistance and occurs in staphylococci resistant to
penicillinase-stable penicillins, such as oxacillin. Cells expressing
heteroresistance grow more slowly than the oxacillin-susceptible
population and may be missed at temperatures above 35◦C. This
is why CLSI recommends incubating isolates being tested against
oxacillin for a full 24 h before reading (CLSI, 2013). Oxacillin
maintains its activity during storage better than methicillin
and is more likely to detect heteroresistant strains. Previously,
Petrelli et al. (2008) found a signiﬁcant correlation between
oxacillin resistance and resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin,
gentamycin and ciproﬂoxacin, which is in queue with our
ﬁndings; but on evaluating our results, penicillin and tetracycline
resistance were also found to be signiﬁcantly correlated with
oxacillin resistance.
should be noted that, widespread
veterinary usage of the ﬂuoroquinolones, particularly in Europe,
has been implicated (CVM, 2009; CVM/FDA, 2015) and that
being a second-generation ﬂuoroquinolone, is on the World
Health Organization’s List of Essential Medicines and the most
important medications needed in a basic health system (WHO,
2015). Fearfully, this could lead to a rapid and sudden evolvement
of resistance to ciproﬂoxacin and other ﬂuoroquinolones, even
during a course of treatment. This documentation is consistent
with antecedent investigations and substantiates the allegations
of MRSA causing healthcare-associated infections as being MDR
to the traditionally prescribed drugs (erythromycin, clindamycin,
ﬂuoroquinolones, and tetracycline), while strains inducing
community-associated infections are generally solely resistant
to ß-lactam agents, erythromycin while feasibly ﬂuoroquinolone
resistant (Oliveira and de Lencastre, 2002).

It

Since 1996, MRSA strains with decreased susceptibility to
vancomycin and strains fully resistant to vancomycin have
been reported (CDC, 2013) a fact which should be taken into
consideration in the Egyptian community as we detected a 20%
resistance to vancomycin. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus

aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(VRSA) are some of the prominent pathogens that cause a wide
variety of infections in humans and animals (Venkatesh et al.,
2006; van Loo et al., 2007; Plata et al., 2009; Cuny et al., 2010;
Gould, 2010; Grundmann et al., 2010). It should be emphasized
that the present investigation highlights the importance of a
sustainable surveillance program for any signs of vancomycin
resistance emergence in Egypt concerning the medical and
veterinary health condition in conjunction to typing and origin
of the isolates. An increase in the cases of incompetent antibiotic
treatment and mortality rates in avian disease (Han et al., 2013) is
a common outcome of methicillin resistance, generating critical
community health concern. Considering the limited options
disease medication caused by MDR staphylococcal species, it
is worrisome that CNS resistant to broad-spectrum antibiotics
have been introduced in the community through the food chain.
Regarding the CNS identiﬁed in this study, S. cohnii and S. lentus
have been signiﬁed to yield enterotoxins (Podkowik et al., 2013).
Batista et al. (2013) have shown that oxacillin is more
sensitive for predicting methicillin resistance, since 100% of
isolates containing the mecA gene were phenotypically resistant
to oxacillin, whereas only 13.3% were resistant to cefoxitin.
Thus, the test using cefoxitin may not accurately reﬂect the
phenotypic resistance of CNS, which has also been observed
by other authors (Frigatto et al., 2005; Hung et al., 2011).
To avoid misinterpretation, the detection of the mecA gene
(the commonest gene that
imparts oxacillin resistance in
staphylococci) by nucleic acid ampliﬁcation tests, such as
the PCR,
is currently considered the criterion standard for
identiﬁcation of MRSA strains (Zhang et al., 2004, 2008; Bagcigil
et al., 2007; Zaraket et al., 2007), but this has not yet been
established for CNS. The risk of transmission of resistance
genes by horizontal interspecies transfer was clear and has been
described by others (Bloemendaal et al., 2010; von Wintersdorﬀ
et al., 2016).

Foodborne pathogens, such as MRSA have become a global
problem after being in North America, Europe and Asia. MRSA
in chicken meat showed its highest prevalence from Germany
(37.2%) (Feßler et al., 2011) followed by Netherlands (16.0%) (de
Boer et al., 2009). On the other hand, low levels of MRSA in
chicken meat were recorded in Japan (Kitai et al., 2005), Jordan
(Quddoumi et al., 2006) to reach 0.3% in Korea (Lim et al.,
2010) and 0% in Austrai (Zarfel et al., 2014). There are also
reports of now the fourth phase has also been started which shows
evidences that both animal and human MRSA has been detected
on meat. Studies in Japan and Korea reported human MRSA
from chicken meat (Lee, 2003; Kitai et al., 2005). Taiwanese
study reported MRSA in chicken carcasses (Lin et al., 2009).
MRSA have also been detected from the foods, such as meat
products and raw chicken meat (Vanderhaeghen et al., 2010).
Regardless of the ongoing endorsed methodizes for the MRSA
susceptibility testing, Lee et al. (2004) demonstrated a variance
in the phenotypic expression of resistance being aﬀected by the
cellular growth conditions and that several MRSA isolates which
were phenotypically resistant to oxacillin, did not encode the
mecA gene. MRSA can be found worldwide and Doyle et al.
(2011) summarized the global survival results in raw meats,

ARGs with Staphylococci Chicken Meat

which indicated that the incidence of MRSA was infrequent in
poultry meat when compared to the beef and pork meats and with
variable prevalences between regions.

Antibiotic resistance patterns of individual pathogens to the
drugs used to treat them vary considerably between and within
countries. The discrepancies and uncomparable results between
researchers, including us, was incriminated by Kluytmans et al.
(1995), Chaibenjawong and Foster (2011), Doyle et al. (2011) and
Omurtag et al. (2013) to be due to several criteria, such as: (i)
sampling and culture methods diﬀered among the studies; (ii)
the condition of the meat when being sold is it packed or un-
packed in the supermarkets or through the widely spread butcher
shops in Great Cairo; (iii) MRSA carriers can contaminate
meat during slaughter and processing; (iv) pathogen load on
raw meat changes according to species; (v) heat treatment and
cross-contamination change the pathogen titre on the meat; (vi)
serving frequency and size, and demographic data; (vii) regional
diﬀerences and social groups dissimilarities are conditions that
must be taken into consideration; (viii) infected/colonized food
handlers are favorable causes for meat contamination (ix)
under conditions of
temperature abuse, MSSA and MRSA
cells could multiply on meat; (ix) the unjuridical use of
antibiotics for animals; (x) diﬀerent patterns of antibiotic use;
(xi) distinct national disease burdens; (xii) disparities in access
to ﬁrst—and second-line treatments; and (xiii) the burden of
coinfections.

Eventually, AMR drugs have become a global public health
crisis implicating the importance of preventing contamination of
food with MRSA, which could have trade consequences and exert
coercion to those sovereignties with un-controlled antimicrobial
practices to create and enforce proper danger administration
strategies. Therefore, the use of antibiotics for animals and their
documentation has become a must to aid in analyzing their use
and consequent impact on public health to enact policy changes
on the consumption of antibiotics (APUA, 2010b; WHO, 2013).

CONCLUSION

The occurrence of CNS in food should not be ignored nor their
pathogenic potential considered as insigniﬁcant as a food-borne
pathogen, rather safety measures should be taken to reduce or
totally eliminate their occurrence in foods. The incidence of CNS
may render food unsafe, as the clinical isolates have been reported
to exude virulent traits (Fowoyo and Ogunbanwo, 2016). Our
ﬁndings emphasize the need for improved hygiene practices
during food processing and also during the distribution and
consumption of the ﬁnal food products to avoid the presence
of CNS and CPS isolates in meat. The present study cynosures
that the MRS has entered the food chain in Egypt through the
raw chicken meat constituting a health hazard to consumers and
should be given importance due to their zoonotic importance.
This necessitates the urgent implementation of an energetic
policy to ensure microbiological food safety to prevent the
spread of MRS through the food chain by contamination of raw
meat. In addition, these isolates might indicate the promulgation
of methicillin, oxacillin, and vancomycin resistance in the
community and imply food safety hazards.
