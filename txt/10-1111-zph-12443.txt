Summary
This study investigated the prevalence of MRSA in samples taken in households, with 
and  without  backyard  pigs  in  villages  in  a  rural  area  of  Shandong  Province,  China. 
Community- associated MRSA and livestock- associated MRSA, belonging to ST59 and 
ST9, respectively, were identified in both humans and pigs. The genotypic and pheno-
typic comparison of isolates indicates that bidirectional transmission of MRSA has oc-
curred between humans and pigs in the villages.

1 |  INTRODUCTION

is  a  major 
Methicillin- resistant  Staphylococcus  aureus  (MRSA) 
multidrug- resistant  opportunistic  pathogen  that  is  responsible 
for  nosocomial  infections  worldwide.  Initially,  MRSA  was  associ-
ated  with  hospital  or  healthcare  contact.  However,  community- 
associated MRSA (CA- MRSA) soon emerged worldwide in persons

without healthcare contact (Chuang & Huang, 2013; Otter & French, 
2010; Vandenesch et al., 2003). During the last decade, livestock- 
associated  MRSA  (LA- MRSA)  has  also  emerged.  LA- MRSA  occurs 
primarily in pigs and foremost as asymptomatic carriage. CA- MRSA 
in  Asia  appears  to  be  characterized  mainly  by  genetic  diversity 
(Chuang & Huang, 2013), but in China, ST59 is the major epidemic 
clonal lineage of MRSA (Chuang & Huang, 2013). The ST9 lineage

predominates in pigs in most Asian countries. However, the domi-
nant European lineage, CC398, also occurs (Chuang & Huang, 2015; 
van Cleef et al., 2011). LA- MRSA has been shown to be transmissi-
ble from pigs to humans, especially to persons in close contact with 
animals, and can cause infections in humans (van Duijkeren et al., 
2016;  Graveland,  Duim,  van  Duijkeren,  Heederik,  &  Wagenaar, 
2011).  Although  the  transfer  ability  of  LA- MRSA  among  humans 
is  lower  than  that  of  other  strains  of  MRSA,  CC398  is  increasing 
in  clinical  settings  (Hetem,  Bootsma,  Troelstra,  &  Bonten,  2013). 
Human and animal health care are interlinked, and a One Health ap-
proach should be applied to understand the dissemination of MRSA 
between the human and the animal sectors (Cars et al., 2016).

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and epide-
miological characteristics of MRSA in villages in a rural area of Shandong 
Province, China, where humans and backyard pigs were sampled (Sun 
et al., 2017). Genotypic characterizations of isolates were performed 
to evaluate relatedness between isolates from humans and pigs.

2 |  MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 | Samples and population

Sampling from humans and pigs was conducted in 12 villages dur-
ing July 2015. The aim was to include every household that had a 
backyard farm with pigs, adding households without backyard farms 
to reach a total of 65 households per village. In each household, one 
human  nasal  sample  and  skin  samples  from  behind  the  ear  of  1–3 
pigs per pen (where relevant) were collected using the ESwab™ col-
lection  kit  (Copan,  Brescia,  Italy)  according  to  the  manufacturer’s 
instructions.

2.2 | MRSA isolation and identification

From  ESwab™  tubes,  0.2 ml  of  transport  liquid  was  transferred  to 
1.3 ml  7.5%  sodium  chloride  broth  (LandBridge,  Beijing,  China)  and 
incubated overnight at 35°C. Samples from the overnight broth were 
cultured  on  CHROMagar™  MRSA  (CHROMagar  Company,  Paris, 
France). One colony on each plate suspected of being MRSA was se-
lected and subcultured on sheep blood agar at 35°C overnight and 
confirmed  as  S. aureus  by  matrix- assisted  laser  desorption  ioniza-
tion–time- of- flight mass spectrometry (MALDI- TOF- MS). For human 
isolates,  Shimadzu  Systems  (Shimadzu  Biotech  Corp.,  Kyoto,  Japan) 
was used, whereas Bruker Daltonik GmbH (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) 
was used for pig isolates. MRSA isolates were confirmed with PCR by 
detecting mecA and mecC (Stegger et al., 2012).

2.3 | Detection of PVL and Molecular typing

DNA  was  extracted  from  MRSA  isolates  using  TIANamp  Bacteria 
DNAKit  (Tiangen,  China)  and  evaluated  for  occurrence  of  Panton- 
Valentine leucocidin (PVL) by PCR (Stegger et al., 2012). All isolates 
were  characterized  by  multilocus  sequence  typing  (MLST),  spa- , 
SCCmec-   and  dru-typing  (Enright,  Day,  Davies,  Peacock,  &  Spratt, 

Impacts

•  Prevalence and epidemiological characteristics of MRSA 

were studied in rural China.

•  CA-MRSA ST59 and LA-MRSA ST9 clones were identi-

fied in both humans and pigs.

•  Bidirectional  transmission  of  MRSA  may  have  occurred 

between humans and pigs.

Harmsen et al., 2003; Zhang, McClure, Elsayed, Louie, & Conly, 2005).

2.4 | Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Antimicrobial  susceptibility  testing  (AST)  of  isolates  was  performed 
using  agar  dilution  with  2- fold  antibiotic  dilutions  in  Muller–Hinton 
agar (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) for cefoxitin (FOX), vancomycin (VAN), 
linezolid (LZD), florfenicol (FLO), gentamicin (GEN), streptomycin (STR), 
ciprofloxacin  (CIP),  rifampicin  (RIF),  tigecycline  (TGC),  clindamycin 
(CLI),  erythromycin  (ERY),  tiamulin  (TIA),  trimethoprim/sulphameth-
oxazole (SXT), fusidic acid (FUS) and tetracycline (TET). Susceptibility 
was determined using epidemiological cut- off values (ECOFFs) by the 
European Committee of Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST, 
2017). S. aureus ATCC29213 was used as the quality control strain.

3 |  RESULTS

In total, 404 pig ear swab samples and 753 human nasal samples were 
collected from 245 and 753 households in the 12 villages, respectively 
(Figure 1). In total, 20 isolates were identified as MRSA with mecA and 
all negative for PVL. Human isolates of MRSA were identified from 
13 (1.7%) households (from seven different villages); pig isolates of 
MRSA were identified from seven (2.8%) households (from five differ-
ent villages). In three households (F012, H022 and K046), both human 
and pig isolates of MRSA were identified.

Molecular  typing  results  showed  that  ten  isolates  belonged  to 
ST9- SCCmecIVb- t899- dt12w (five identified among humans and five 
identified among pigs), seven isolates belonged to ST59- SCCmecIVa- 
t437- dt10a (six identified among humans and one identified among 
pigs) and one human isolate of MRSA belonged to ST59- SCCmecIVa- 
t3257- dt10a  which  was  a  single- locus  variation  in  SPA  type  t437 
(Table 1). The other two isolates belonged to ST9- SCCmecIVb- t899- 
dt12aj  (recovered  from  human  sample)  and  ST9- SCCmecIVb- t899- 
dt11dg (recovered from pig sample). In the three households, humans 
and  pigs  shared  the  same  genotypes,  two  households  with  ST9- 
t899- SCCmecIVb- dt12w and one with ST59- t437- SCCmecIVa- dt10a 
(Table 1).

The AST (Table 1) showed that all isolates were resistant to ERY, 
CLI, STR, FOX and susceptible to LZD, VAN and FUS. The ST9 isolates

also  showed  resistance  to  SXT,  FLO,  CIP,  GEN,  TGC,  TIA  and  TET. 
Furthermore, three ST9 isolates were also resistant to RIF.

4 |  DISCUSSION

In this study, the prevalence of MRSA in rural residents was investi-
gated. Human isolates of MRSA were identified in 1.7% of the house-
holds, which is similar to earlier reports, 2.2% among interns (Ma et al., 
2011) and 3.0% carriage among healthy people on a medical college 
campus in China (Du et al., 2011), although it is higher than the 0.3% 
carriage reported among adults from Beijing and Harbin (Yan et al., 
2015).  Another  study  showed  that  no  MRSA  was  identified  among 
military volunteers from Beijing (Qu et al., 2010).

The prevalence of MRSA in backyard pigs was also investigated 
in this study. About 2.8% of the households with sampled backyard 
farms had pigs with MRSA, which is lower than the prevalence re-
ported earlier from pigs in China (Fan, Wu, Li, Wang, & Zuo, 2014). 
However, direct comparisons are problematic to make since other 
studies from China often report prevalence in pigs from a small num-
ber  of  farms  and  in- herd  prevalence,  thus  possibly  reflecting  high 
proportions of carriage at specific farms. Furthermore, large com-
mercial farms are more well studied and may in general have higher 
MRSA  rates,  for  example,  11%  of  pigs  at  commercial  pig  farms  in 

Henan Province (Fan et al., 2014). Nevertheless, in one study, 21% 
of small private farms had pigs with MRSA (Yan et al., 2015), which 
is higher than that in our study.

MLST  results  showed  that  all  isolates  belonged  to  either  ST9 
or  ST59  (Table 1).  ST9  is  the  LA- MRSA  predominating  in  China 
and Asian countries (Chuang & Huang, 2015), whereas ST59 is the 
most common ST among CA- MRSA and MRSA cases in hospitals in 
China (Chuang & Huang, 2013). ST9 isolates were equally distrib-
uted among the human and pig samples, while ST59 isolates were 
mainly identified among humans, except for one isolate which was 
recovered from a pig sample. In three households, humans and pigs 
shared the same genotypes. The findings of households with geno-
typically identical MRSA isolates of ST59 and ST9 in both pigs and 
humans indicate that the transmissions of MRSA between humans 
and animals likely are bidirectional.

The AST (Table 1) showed that the ST9 isolates were resistant to a 
higher number of antibiotics compared to the ST59 isolates. Three ST9 
isolates were  also  resistant  to  RIF.  RIF  resistance  has  recently  been 
described in LA- MRSA strains that were recovered from pigs at farms 
and slaughterhouses (Li et al., 2016).

To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  study  on  the  prevalence  and 
epidemiological  characteristics  of  MRSA  among  rural  residents  and 
domesticated  pigs  in  China.  The  data  showed  an  even  distribution 
of CA- MRSA and LA- MRSA among humans and a predominance of
