Abstract The study was undertaken to determine the prev-
alence of bovine mastitis, isolate mastitis causing bacteria,
assess the association of some risk factors, and determine
the antibiotic resistance pattern of bacterial isolates in cows
in large-scale dairy farms of Northern Ethiopia. A total of
305 lactating and nonlactating cows were included in the
present study. The overall prevalence of clinical and sub-
clinical mastitis was 3.6 and 33.8 %, respectively. The
quarter level prevalence was 15.4 %; from which, 11.9 and
1.1 % were subclinical form and blind teat, respectively,
while the remaining 2.4 % were of clinical form. Staphylo-
coccus aureus accounted for 36 % of the isolates followed
by Escherichia coli (27.3 %). Risk factors including age (p<
0.001), parity (p< 0.001), and lactation stage (p 00.02)
showed significant association with the occurrence of mas-
titis. Higher prevalence was observed in both groups of
older cows (i.e., 6–9 years (odds ratio (OR)04.65, 95 %
confidence interval (CI)02.74–7.89) and >9 years (OR0
3.63, 95 % CI01.42–9.25)), cows with four to seven calves

(OR03.39, 95 % CI02.06–5.60), and cows in late lactation
stage (OR03.79, 95 % CI01.64–8.75). In multivariable
logistic regression analysis, age (p00.005) and lactation
stage (p00.027) showed statistically significant association
with the occurrence of mastitis. The antimicrobial suscepti-
bility pattern showed high susceptibility of S. aureus to
nalidixic acid (82.4 %) followed by chloramphenicol
(58.8 %); however, these species were resistant to the rest
of the antimicrobials tested. Highest resistance was observed
against clindamycin and ampicillin. Coliform bacteria (E. coli
and Klebsiella pneumoniae) showed resistance to most of the
antimicrobials used. Detailed investigation is needed to iden-
tify the interplay of managemental and environmental risk
factors to design appropriate control measures.

Introduction

Milk is one of the most important foods of human beings. It
is universally recognized as a complete diet due to its
essential components (Javaid et al. 2009). However, health
risk to consumers can be associated with milk, due to the
presence of zoonotic pathogens and antimicrobial drug res-
idues (Bradley 2002). The quality of milk may be lowered
by a numbers of factors such as adulteration, contamination
during and after milking, and the presence of udder infections
(Esron et al. 2005).

Mastitis, inflammation of the mammary gland, is a highly
prevalent problem in dairy cattle and is one of the most
important
threats affecting the world's dairy industry
(Wallenberg et al. 2002). Mastitis has been known to cause
a great deal of loss or reduction of productivity, influence the

1766

quality and quantity of milk yield, and cause culling of animals
at an unacceptable age. The disease generally involves the
interplay between management practice and infectious agents.
Ethiopia has the largest cattle population in Africa with
an estimated population of 49.3 million (CSA 2008).
Around 42 % of the total cattle heads are milking cows.
Given the considerable potential for smallholder income and
employment generation from high-value dairy products,
development of the dairy sector in Ethiopia can contribute
significantly to poverty alleviation and nutrition in the coun-
try. Nevertheless, the quality and quantity of milk produced
in the country deteriorate because of various causes (Matios
et al. 2009). Undoubtedly, mastitis is the single most important
disease that significantly affects the dairy sector.

Several studies in the country have documented prevalence
ranging from 1.8 to 21.1 % for clinical and 22.3 to 46.6 % for
subclinical mastitis with significant economic losses associated
with the disease (Workineh et al. 2002; Kerro and Tareke 2003;
Biffa et al. 2005; Hunderra et al. 2005; Mungube et al. 2005;
Getahun et al. 2008; Almaw et al. 2008; Bitew et al. 2010).

Mastitis is one of the major diseases of crossbred cows in
Addis Ababa milk shed next to reproductive-associated
problems (Lemma et al. 2001). Mungube et al. (2005) and
Tesfaye et al. (2010) estimated the economic losses from
mastitis in the urban and periurban areas of Addis Ababa, to
be US$ 58 and 78.65 per cow and per lactation, respectively.
Although several studies have revealed the significance
of the diseases in various scales of dairy farms, all of them
focused in Central Ethiopia mainly Addis Ababa and its
environs and small-scale dairy farms. Only few studies have
investigated the prevalence of mastitis in large-scale dairy
farms. There is paucity of information on the status of
mastitis in Tigray Regional State, Northern Ethiopia, which
accounts for around 10 % of the national cattle population.
High-yielding cattle breeds are being introduced to house-
holds and small businesses to satisfy the increasing demand
for milk and dairy products. On the other hand, with inten-
sification of dairy cows, mastitis could be devastating war-
ranting a coordinated epidemiological surveillance system.
To our knowledge, this is the first report from Mekelle and
its surroundings, Northern Ethiopia. This work was
designed to determine the prevalence and some associated
risk factors for bovine mastitis, to isolate bacterial causative
agents, and to determine the antibiotic susceptibility profile
of bacterial isolates against the commonly used antibiotics.

Materials and methods

Study area

The study was conducted in different large-scale dairy farms
in and around Mekelle, Northern Ethiopia. Mekelle is the

capital city of Tigray Regional State and is located at
783 km north of Addis Ababa at 38.5° east longitude and
13.5° north latitude and an altitude of 2,200 m above sea
level. The mean annual rainfall of the area is 628.8 mm. The
annual minimum and maximum temperature is 11.8 and
29.94 °C, respectively. The cattle population of Tigray Re-
gion is estimated above 4.5 million heads, and the cattle
population of the study area is about 0.94 million; of which,
the dairy cattle population (cross breed and local breeds) of
the area is about 36,500. The average milk production of the
local breeds and crossbred (local zebu×Friezian) cows is
about 2.9 l/day and 8.5 liter/day, respectively (RSTBARD
2009).

Farms and study design

The investigation was planned as an 8-month long (October
2009 to May 2010) cross-sectional study. The target popu-
lation was all large market-oriented dairy farms. General
descriptions of the Ethiopian improved breed-based dairy
farms were published previously (Workineh et al. 2002;
Shiferaw et al. 2003; Mungube et al. 2005).

The farms are market-oriented specialized dairy farms.
Milk is sold to the city's cafeteria and households. The study
farms have exclusively crossbred cattle (Friesian with local
zebu breeds) with blood proportions above 70 % exotic.
Hand milking is practiced twice a day. Calves are allowed
either to suckle before and after milking or bucket fed. A
variety of feed stuffs are used in the diets, such as hay
supplemented with urea, wheat barn, sesame cake, cotton-
seed cake, and in some farms clover and alfalfa. The farms
use modern houses with concrete floor with well-ventilated
and rain-proof roof system. The farms receive artificial
insemination, pregnancy diagnosis, and veterinary services
from the city's veterinary services.

For the purpose of this study, large dairy farm was
defined as one with herd size of 50 dairy cows and above
according to Shiferaw et al. (2003). Between October 2009
and May 2010, 13 large dairy farms were identified in the
study region, and samples were collected. The mean size of
herds included in the study was 71 (range 52–157). No
information was available for prevalence estimates of larger
herds in the region. Based on the resources available, 20 to
30 animals were randomly selected from each farm in pro-
portion to the size of the farm. Accordingly, 305 lactating
crossbred (Holstein-Friesian×zebu) cows with healthy or
inflamed udder were included in the study.

To determine the association of risk factors, data includ-
ing age, parity, and physiological status of the cow were
collected from the record sheet of the farms and by obser-
vation. Age of the study animals was determined from birth
records and dentition characteristics and categorized as
young adults (>3 to 5 years), adults (>6 to 9 years), and

Trop Anim Health Prod (2012) 44:1765–1771

1767

old (>9 years). Parity was also categorized as few (with one
to three calves), moderate (four to seven calves), and many
(>7 calves). Lactation stage of the cow was categorized as
early lactation (1–120 days), mid-lactation (121–240 days),
and late lactation (above 240 days).

Clinical examination of the udder

Following clinical examination, clinical mastitis was diag-
nosed at the quarter level based on visible and palpable
signs (hard and swollen quarter, kicking up on touching
the udder, heat) as previously described (Kivaria et al.
2007). In addition, milk from each quarter was withdrawn
and examined for any change (watery secretions, clots in
milk, and blood-tinged secretions). The size and consistency
of mammary quarters were inspected for the presence of any
anatomical malformation, such as disproportional symme-
try, swelling, firmness, and blindness.

California mastitis test

The California mastitis test (CMT) was conducted to diag-
nose the presence of subclinical mastitis. This screening test
was performed according to the procedure given by Quinn
et al. (2002). The result was scored as 0, +1, +2, or +3
depending on the intensity of reaction. Samples with CMT
result score of 0 and +1 were considered as negative, while
those with a score of +2 or +3 were taken as positive. If at
least one quarter was positive by the CMT, the cow was
considered positive.

Milk sample collection

Milk samples were collected aseptically from quarter's di-
agnosed with CMT>+2 and clinical cases and were submit-
ted for bacteriological examination and tests for antibiotic
susceptibility. Briefly, the udder of the cow was thoroughly
cleaned with water and dried with a clean towel. After
disinfecting the teats with swabs with 70 % ethyl alcohol,
milk was collected. The first three to four streams of milk
were discarded, and then, 5–10 ml of milk was collected
from each teat aseptically in separate universal bottles.
Tubes were sealed properly and transported on ice to Veter-
inary Microbiology laboratory in Mekelle University, where
samples were immediately cultured or kept in a refrigerator
at 4 °C for a maximum of 24 h until cultured on standard
bacteriological media.

Bacteriological examination of milk samples

Bacteriological examination was done with some modifica-
tion according to Quinn et al. (2002). A loopful of milk
sample was streaked on tryptose blood agar base enriched

with 7 % defibrinated sheep blood (Oxoid, UK) and
MacConkey agar (Oxoid, UK) plates using the quadrant
streaking method. Both agar plates were incubated aerobically
at 37 °C for 24–48 h and examined for characteristic bacterial
colonies. Pure culture colonies were selected and subcultured
on general purpose medium, nutrient agar (Oxoid, UK), and
incubated aerobically at 37 °C for 24–48 h for further bio-
chemical identification. After this incubation on nutrient agar
(Oxoid, UK), bacteria were identified according to their Gram
reaction and morphology. Further identification of the organ-
isms was done by implementing biochemical tests, catalase,
oxidase, CAMP test, IMViC tests, triple sugar iron agar test,
nitrate reduction, and urease test. In addition, mannitol salt
agar was used to differentiate Staphylococcus aureus from
other Staphylococcus spp.

Antimicrobial susceptibility test

Antimicrobial susceptibility test was conducted on a total of
48 randomly selected bacterial isolates, Staphylococcus spe-
cies (n026) and coliforms (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella
pnuemoniae (n022), which were frequently recovered dur-
ing the study period. The isolates were tested for their
susceptibility to six antimicrobials using the Kirby–Bauer
disk diffusion method (Cappucino and Sherman 2005). The
following antimicrobial disks (Oxoid, UK) with their
corresponding concentration were used: ampicillin
(10 μg), erythromycin (15 μg), nalidixic acid (30 μg), clin-
damycin (2 μg), sulfamethoxazole (25 μg), and chloram-
phenicol (30 μg). The cutoff values for the evaluation of the
susceptibility of isolates were when the inhibition zone was
greater than or equal to 29 and 17 mm for ampicillin (for
staphylococci and Gram-negative enteric organisms, respec-
tively) and 23, 19, 21, 16, and 18 mm for erythromycin,
nalidixic acid, clindamycin, sulfamethoxazole, and chloram-
phenicol, respectively. As a plating medium, Mueller–Hinton
agar was used. Antibiotic-impregnated paper discs and plates
were incubated at 37 °C for 16–18 h. Interpretation was made
as per the zone size inhibition chart provided by the manufac-
turer of the antibiotic disks. The antimicrobial susceptibility
was scored as resistant, intermediate, and sensitive based on
sensitivity pattern.

Statistical analysis

Data obtained both from bacteriology and questionnaire
were stored in Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft
Corp.). Prevalence of mastitis related to specific risk factors
was determined as the proportion of affected cows out of the
total examined. These data were analyzed by descriptive
statistics, univariable and multivariable regression using
the SPSS 11.5 statistical package (SPSS 2002). To see the
contribution of the various risk factors for the occurrence of

Results

Prevalence

Of the total 305 cows examined during the study period, 114
(37.4 %) of the cows were positive for mastitis. Out of these,
3.6 % (11/305) and 33.8 % (103/305) showed clinical and
subclinical mastitis, respectively. The quarter level preva-
lence was found to be 15.3 % (187/1220); from which, 11.
9 % (145/1220) and 1.1 % (13/1220) were found to be of
subclinical form and blind teat, respectively. The remaining
2.4 % (29/1220) were of clinical form revealing active cases
of mastitis with visible signs of inflammation on the udder
and changes in milk quality. From the total of 114 cows
found positive with CMT, 56.1 % (64/114), 30.7 % (35/
114), 6.1 % (7/114), and 7 % (8/114) were found positive for
single, two, three, and four quarters, respectively.

Bacteriological examination result

Milk samples from 174 quarters, 103 CMT positive and 11
clinically infected cows, were cultured. Milk samples from
67 dairy cows showed growth only on blood agar whereas
samples from 47 dairy cows showed growth on both
MacConkey and blood agar. A total of 128 bacterial isolates
were isolated from the milk samples processed. Out of these
isolates, 28 (21.9 %) were from clinical mastitis, and the
other 100 (78.1 %) isolates were from subclinical mastitis.
S. aureus accounted for 46 (36 %) of the isolates (3 and 43
isolates from clinical and subclinical mastitis, respectively)

followed by E. coli which accounted for 35 (27.3 %) of the
bacterial isolates (16 and 19 isolates from clinical and sub-
clinical mastitis, respectively). E. coli was the most common
isolate from clinical mastitis cases 16 (66.7 %) followed by S.
aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus dysga-
lactiae 10.7 % each whereas S. aureus 43 (41.3 %) was the
predominant isolate from subclinical cases followed by E. coli
19 (18.3 %) (Table 1).

Risk factors

Association of the investigated risk factors and the occur-
rence of mastitis in large-scale dairy farms of Mekelle City
are shown in Table 2. Univariable logistic regression anal-
ysis indicated that all the risk factors assessed showed
significant association with the occurrence of mastitis. Cows
older than 6 years were more affected (53.5 %) with mastitis
compared to young adult cows (19.9 %). Similarly, there
was a higher occurrence of mastitis in cows with four to
seven calves (53.3 %, odds ratio (OR)03.39, 95 % confi-
dence interval (CI)02.06–5.60) than those cows with one to
three calves. In relation to lactation stages of the cow, a
higher prevalence of mastitis was recorded in cows at late
stage of lactation (66.7 %, OR03.79, 95 % CI01.64–8.75)
than cows in early and mid-lactation stages. In multivariable
logistic regression analysis, age (p00.005) and lactation

stage (p00.027) showed a statistically significant associa-
tion with the occurrence of mastitis.

Antimicrobial susceptibility test result

Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed on a total
of 48 frequently isolated bacterial isolates (S. aureus (n017),
other Staphylococcus species (n09), E. coli (n015), and
Klebsiella pneumoniae (n07)). S. aureus showed high sus-
ceptibility to nalidixic acid (82.4 %) followed by chloram-
phenicol (58.8 %). However, this organism was resistant to
clindamycin (88.2 %), ampicillin (82.4 %), erythromycin
(58.8 %), and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (52.9 %). The
other Staphylococcus species were also susceptible to nali-
dixic acid (77.8 %) and chloramphenicol (66.7 %) but showed
resistance to the rest of the antimicrobials (Table 3). The
coliform bacteria (E. coli and K. pneumoniae) were resistant
to most of the antimicrobials used (Table 4).

Discussion

In the present study, the overall prevalence of mastitis in
crossbreed cows owned by large-scale dairy farms was
37.4 % and is in close agreement with previous findings,
33.6 % by Getahun et al. (2008), 34.9 % by Biffa et al.

(2005), and 40.4 % by Kerro and Tareke (2003) in urban and
periurban smallholder production systems of Ethiopia. How-
ever, the finding by Workineh et al. (2002) (59.7 %) in two
major Ethiopian dairies is much higher than the present report.
Similarly, the prevalence report of both clinical and subclini-
cal mastitis is lower than the findings of Workineh et al.
(2002) who reported 21.5 % clinical and 38.2 % subclinical
mastitis. Data on large dairy farms in the country are few.
Differences have been observed in the prevalence of mastitis
in the present study and other reports, and the reasons for these
variations need to be analyzed in further studies that include
more data on management variables. Blind quarters (1.1 %)
reported in this study might be associated with the seriousness
of mastitis problem and absence of culling chronically
infected animals in those farms.

The high prevalence of S. aureus followed by coliforms
(mainly E. coli) in this study is in accordance with other
workers (Hunderra et al. 2005; Abera et al. 2010). S. aureus
is the most important and prevalent mastitis-causing organism
globally, including Ethiopia. High prevalence of S. aureus
points to poor milking time hygiene as this pathogen is mainly
spread during milking via milkers' hands and towels (Bradley
2002). Higher incidence of coliform mastitis is an indication
of poor hygienic practices in dairy environment, as these
organisms originate from the cow's environment and infect
the udder through the teat canal. Contamination of end of the
teat is a major predisposing factor in the development of
environmental mastitis (Bradley 2002). The most commonly
used antibiotic for the treatment of mastitis in the study area is
penicillin in combination with streptomycin, and this may
explain for the lower rate of isolation of streptococcal organ-
isms in the present study.

The prevalence of infected quarters increases with age,
peaking at 7 years and with an increasing parity of cows.
This may be attributed to the increased opportunity of in-
fection with time and the prolonged duration of infection,
especially in a herd without a mastitis control program. The
observed higher prevalence of mastitis with increasing age
and parity is in accordance with the work of other investi-
gators (Almaw et al. 2008; Abera et al. 2010). In the present
study, late lactation stage was also found to increase the
occurrence of mastitis significantly (p<0.05). These infec-
tions could be the result of chronic contagious mastitis
which transferred from lactation to lactation. The chance
of occurrence of contagious mastitis would be high toward
the end of lactation due to repeated exposure.

The antimicrobial susceptibility tests carried out in this
study indicated for the high resistance of Staphylococcus
species to ampicillin followed by clindamycin and erythro-
mycin. The resistance of S. aureus to ampicillin may be
attributed to the production of betalactamase, an enzyme
that inactivates penicillin and closely related antibiotics.
This could be associated with the predominant use of

penicillin for treatment of mastitis cases in the area. Coli-
form bacteria (E. coli and K. pneumoniae) were resistant to
most of the antimicrobials tested. The probable reason for
the development of resistance by these organisms to most of
the antimicrobials tested is prolonged and indiscriminate
usage of these antimicrobials in the study area.

In conclusion, the present study indicated considerable
prevalence of the disease with the isolation of major patho-
genic microorganisms from both clinical and subclinical
mastitis in larger dairy farms of Mekelle and its surrounding.
To reduce the impact of the disease on the dairy sector,
appropriate control measures targeting the specific causative
agent (contagious or environmental pathogens) should be in
place, and awareness needs to be created to dairy producers
on the impact of the disease. The antimicrobial susceptibil-
ity test showed resistance of the major bacterial isolates to
most of the antimicrobial agents tested. Therefore, dairy
farm owners need to be advised to avoid the indiscriminate
use of one type of antimicrobial for a long period and the
need to consult animal health professionals for prescription
and administration of drugs. Further work aimed at deter-
mining the interplay of management and environmental risk
factors should help to design appropriate control measures.

Acknowledgments The investigation received financial support
from Agazi dairy farms, Mekelle, Northern Ethiopia. The authors are
grateful to the material assistance rendered by the College of Veterinary
Medicine, Mekelle University. Many thanks are due to large dairy farm
owners for their keen interest in the study and cooperation during data
collection. We are also thankful to Prof. S.K. Khar for extending his
help in commenting the work and checking the manuscript's English.
