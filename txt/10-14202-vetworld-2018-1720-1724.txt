Abstract

Aim: The present study was carried out to determine the prevalence and molecular detection of fluoroquinolone-resistant 
Escherichia coli carrying qnrA and qnrS genes in healthy broiler chickens in Mymensingh, Bangladesh, and also to identify 
the genes responsible for such resistance.
Materials and Methods: A total of 65 cloacal swabs were collected from apparently healthy chickens of 0-14 days (n=23) 
and 15-35 days (n=42) old. The samples were cultured onto Eosin Methylene Blue Agar, and the isolation and identification 
of the E. coli were performed based on morphology, cultural, staining, and biochemical properties followed by polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) targeting E. coli 16S rRNA genes. The isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility test against 
five commonly used antibiotics under fluoroquinolone (quinolone) group, namely gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, 
ofloxacin, and pefloxacin by disk diffusion method. Detection of qnrA and qnrS genes was performed by PCR.
Results: Among the 65 cloacal samples, 54 (83.08%) were found to be positive for E. coli. Antibiotic sensitivity test revealed 
that, of these 54 isolates, 18 (33.33%) were found to be resistant to at least one fluoroquinolone antibiotic. The highest 
resistance was observed against pefloxacin (61.11%). By PCR, of 18 E. coli resistant to fluoroquinolone, 13 (72.22%) were 
found to be positive for the presence of qnrS. None of the isolates were found positive for qnrA.
Conclusion:  Fluoroquinolone-resistant  E.  coli  harboring  qnrS  genes  is  highly  prevalent  in  apparently  healthy  broiler 
chickens and possesses a potential threat to human health.

Introduction

Antibiotic resistance is an ever-increasing mul-
tinational public health crisis. It causes an estimated 
700,000 deaths each year across the world [1]. Modern 
food animal production depends on the use of large 
amount of antibiotics for disease control and agricul-
tural purposes, particularly for growth enhancement. 
This  increased  use  of  antibiotics  is  known  to  be  a 
major factor for the development of antibiotic resis-
tance in bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant bacterial species 
are  widely  distributed  in  both  healthy  and  diseased 
animals and birds. Diseases caused by antibiotic-re-
sistant  bacteria  are  very  difficult  to  treat.  Poultry 
eggs and meats are major sources of human dietary 
 protein. In Bangladesh poultry is raised in close asso-
ciation  with  human.  From  healthy  birds,  these  anti-
biotic-resistant bacteria can spread directly to human

or indirectly through contaminated egg and meat, for 
example, through the food chain to cause severe health 
problems    [2].  Escherichia  coli  is  a  Gram-negative 
enteric  bacterium  of  the  family  Enterobacteriaceae. 
They are one of the main species of bacteria that live 
in the lower intestines of warm-blooded animals and 
birds. While most of the E. coli strains are non-patho-
genic, some of them can cause a variety of intestinal 
and  extraintestinal  infections  in  men,  animals,  and 
poultry  [3].  In  the  poultry  industry,  colibacillosis,  a 
disease caused by E.  coli, significantly contributes to 
increased mortality and economic losses [4].

Fluoroquinolone  (quinolones)  antibiotics  are  a 
group of synthetic broad-spectrum bactericidal chem-
ical agents having a bicyclic core structure related to 
4-quinolone. They were introduced first in the form of 
nalidixic acid in the 1960s. This fully synthetic agent 
was discovered as a by-product of research on antima-
larial drugs. Fluoroquinolones are also one of the most 
commonly  used  antibiotics,  particularly  in  poultry. 
Fluoroquinolones interfere bacterial DNA synthesis by 
inhibiting topoisomerase class enzymes, namely DNA 
gyrase (topoisomerase II) in Gram-negative bacteria 
and topoisomerase IV in Gram-positive microorgan-
isms [5]. Resistance against fluoroquinolone occured 
is primarily due to activities of products of genes such 
1720

the bacterial DNA synthesis. Since the 1990s, reports 
on the occurrence of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli 
from humans as well as animal have increased signifi-
cantly [6-8]. Fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli isolates 
have become a major problem in infection control and 
treatment worldwide.

In Bangladesh, few previous studies were carried 
out to investigate the occurrence and characterization 
of  fluoroquinolone-  and  quinolone-resistant  E.  coli 
in human [7,8]. Quinolone-resistant E. coli has also 
been detected in healthy cattle and other animals from 
many other countries [9,10]. Recently, in a study in 
Bangladesh, quinolone-resistant E. coli was detected 
from apparently healthy cattle [11]. As fluoroquino-
lones are of major therapeutic importance in human 
medicine, quinolone-resistant E. coli is of great public 
health concern. Bangladesh is one of the most densely 
populated countries of the world. The livestock and 
poultry population, here, are also noticeable. Due to 
the  close  contact  of  human  with  poultry,  there  is  a 
great chance for the transmission of antibiotic-resis-
tant E. coli from poultry to human.

To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  no  work  has 
yet  been  reported  in  Bangladesh  on  fluoroquino-
lone resistant in E. coli in healthy broiler chickens 
targeting  the  detection  of  qnrA  and  qnrS  genes  by 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The present study 
was carried out to determine the occurrence of flu-
oroquinolone-resistant  E.  coli  in  healthy  broiler  in 
Mymensingh,  Bangladesh.  In  addition,  the  genes 
responsible for such resistance were also identified 
by PCR-based approach.
Materials and Methods
Ethical approval

No  ethical  approval  was  required  although  all 
applicable  international,  national,  and  institutional 
guidelines for the care and use of animals were fol-
lowed during sample collection.
Collection of samples

A total of 65 cloacal swab samples were collected 
randomly  from  apparently  healthy  broiler  chickens 
sold  at  Bangladesh  Agricultural  University  (BAU), 
Mymensingh, and surrounding  area.  Among  these 
65 samples, 23 originated from BAU poultry farm, 5 
from  Kawatkhali  market,  15  from  Sesmore  market, 
and 22 from KR market, BAU. Samples were collected 
maintaining sterile condition and categorized into two 

age groups: 0-14 days and 15-35 days depending on 
the age of the birds.
Isolation and identification of E. coli

Isolation  and  identification  of  E.  coli  from  the 
collected cloacal swab were done based on morphol-
ogy,  staining,  cultural,  and  biochemical  character-
istics  [12]. Confirmation of the E. coli isolates was 
done by PCR. DNA for the PCR was extracted from 
pure culture by boiling method. In brief, 100  µl of 
deionized  water  was  taken  into  an  Eppendorf  tube. 
A  pure  bacterial  colony  from  overnight  culture  on 
37°C of Eosin Methylene Blue Agar was gently mixed 
with deionized water. The tube was then transferred 
into boiling water and boiled for 10 min, then imme-
diately  transferred  to  ice  for  cold  shock  for  about 
10  min,  and  finally  centrifuged  at  10,000  rpm  for 
10 min. Supernatant from each tube was collected and 
used as PCR DNA template. The extracted DNA was 
stored at −20°C until use. PCR for E. coli 16S rRNA 
gene was performed using primers ECO-1 and ECO-2 
(Table-1) according to the standard protocol [13,14].
Antibiotic sensitivity test

The  isolated  E.  coli  isolates  were  subjected  to 
antibiotic sensitivity test against five commonly used 
fluoroquinolone,  i.e.,  gatifloxacin  (5  µg),  levofloxa-
cin (5 µg), moxifloxacin (5 µg), ofloxacin (5 µg), and 
pefloxacin (5 µg), following disc diffusion method, as 
described by Bauer et al. [15]. All the tests were per-
formed on Mueller-Hinton media with a concentration 
of  bacteria  equivalent  to  0.5  McFarland  standards. 
Results of the antibiotic sensitivity tests were recorded 
as sensitive, intermediately sensitive, or resistant, and 
the zone of growth inhibition was compared with the 
zone size interpretative tables provided by the Clinical 
and Laboratory Standards Institute [16].
Molecular detection of qnrA and qnrS genes

Molecular  detection  of  E.  coli  carrying  fluoro-
quinolone-resistant  genes  (qnrA  and  qnrS)  was  per-
formed  by  PCR  [14].  For  this  purpose,  DNA  was 
extracted  from  E.  coli  that  was  found  resistant  to 
quinolone  phenotypically  by  the  boiling  method  as 
described above. The primers used for the detection of 
qnrA and qnrS are presented in Table-1 [13,14].

coli was found in 15-35-day-old healthy broiler chick-
ens  (88.07%),  while  the  prevalence  was  73.91%  in 
0-14-day-old birds.
Phenotypic  detection  of  fluoroquinolone-resistant 
E.  coli

All the isolates of E. coli (n=54) were screened 
for antibiogram profile against the five fluoroquinolone 
group of antibiotics. Among these, 18 (33.33%) isolates 
were found resistant to at least one fluoroquinolone anti-
biotic (Figure-1). To be sure that these are E. coli, PCR 
was done, and all these 18 isolates were found positive 
for E. coli 16S rRNA genes (data were not shown).

From Table-3, it is evident that, in general, flu-
oroquinolone resistance was higher in E. coil isolated 
from the older birds, i.e., 15-35 days old as compared 
to younger birds of 0-14 days old. The overall anti-
biogram profile of the isolated E. coli against vari ous 
groups of quinolone groups of antibiotics is presented 
in  Table-4.  From  the  antibiogram  profile,  it  was 
observed that the highest resistance was found against 
pefloxacin (61.11%), while the levofloxacin showed 
less percentage of resistance (22.22%).
Molecular detection of qnrA and qnrS genes

Eighteen E. coli that showed phenotypically resis-
tant to one or more quinolone group of antibiotics were 
PCR screened for the detection of qnrA and qnrS genes. 
None of the isolates were found positive for qnrA (prev-
alence 0%). On the other hand, among 18 isolates, 13 
(prevalence 72.22%) were found positive (Table-5) for 
qnrS gene amplifying 417-bp amplicon (Figure-2).

On age bases, the prevalence of qnrS was found 
higher in older birds, i.e., 15-35-day-old birds com-
pared to younger 0-14-day-old birds.
Discussion

Antibiotic-resistant  bacteria  are  of  great  public 
health concern since they possess a significant threat to 
human and animal health. E. coli is ubiquitous in nature 
and found commonly as intestinal flora of animal and 
birds. Many of these E. coli are pathogenic and zoonotic 
in nature. Once they become antibiotic resistant, it is very 
difficult to treat the disease caused by them. Increasing 
bacterial resistance to quinolone antibiotics is apparent 
in humans, livestock, and poultry. The potential source of 
these resistant bacteria for human is livestock and poul-
try or their products entering the human food chain.

Fluoroquinolones  are  broad-spectrum  anti-
microbial  agents,  used  extensively  in  poultry  [17]. 
Fluoroquinolone-resistant genes such as gyrA, gyrB, 

and parC are located in chromosome, while gnr genes 
are located in plasmid. In this study, we focused on 
this  plasmid-mediated  quinolone  resistance  since 
these qnr genes containing plasmid have potentiality 
for  transfer  of  resistance  to  other  bacteria  horizon-
tally  [18].  In  addition,  these  plasmid  harboring  qnr 
genes  may  also  encode  extended-spectrum  beta-lac-
tamases such as CTX-M, SHV, and TEM type [19].

In  this  study,  about  83.03%  apparently  healthy 
broiler  chickens  were  found  to  be  positive  for  the 
presence of E. coli in their cloacal swabs (Table-2). 
Since  E.  coli  is  a  normal  inhabitant  of  birds’  lower 
gastrointestinal  tract,  it  was  not  unexpected  to  find 
them  in  higher  percentage  in  the  cloacal  samples. 
There are previous reports on 60–82% prevalence of 
E. coli in apparently healthy chickens in Mymensingh, 
Bangladesh [20,21]. These observed variations in the 
prevalence of E. coli in healthy chickens could be due 
to variations in the hygienic status of farms, farm bios-
ecurity, ventilation system, sample size, and location 
of the study area. In this study, we observed a higher

prevalence  of  E.  coli  in  older  birds  as  compared  to 
younger bird as supported by earlier reports [22]. This 
observed a higher prevalence of E. coli in older birds 
might be due to their longer duration of exposure to 
unhygienic  environment,  unhealthy  management, 
poor feeding, and watering as compared to younger 
birds.

Fluoroquinolone  antibiotics  are  widely  used  in 
poultry to treat diseases caused by E. coli. Antibiogram 
profile observed in this study revealed 33.33% E. coli 
as  resistant  to  one  or  more  fluoroquinolone  group 
of  antibiotics  phenotypically.  This  resistance  was 
higher in older birds as compared to younger birds. 
It is alarming that, here, we found some of the iso-
lates as multidrug-resistant (MDR) showing resistant 
against two or three fluoroquinolone group of antibi-
otic (Figure-1). In a report from Czech Republic, the 
resistance  of  E.  coli  of  poultry  isolates  to  quinolo-
nes ranged from 53% to 73%. Among these resistant 
phenotypes, resistant genes were detected in 58% of 
the tested strains [4]. Among the quinolone-resistant 
genes,  qnrA  and  qnrS  are  important.  In  this  study, 
among  the  resistant  phenotype,  about  72.22%  iso-
lates were found positive for qnrS gene, while none 
was  found  positive  for  qnrA.  Earlier  in  Sweden,  an 
Veterinary World, EISSN: 2231-0916 

increased  quinolone-resistant  E.    coli  was  noted  in 
broiler population, despite the lack of a known selec-
tive pressure [23]. They also detected quinolone-resis-
tant qnrS gene in E. coli strain isolated from broiler.

Due to their high efficacy, quinolones are widely 
prescribed  antibiotic  classes  for  the  treatment  of 
human  infections  caused  by  bacteria  and  have  been 
considered  critically  important  for  human  health  by 
the WHO  [24]. The presence of high level of fluoro-
quinolone-resistant E. coli in healthy broiler chicken 
as detected in this study is, therefore, very important 
from the public health point of view. Since human can 
get  these  resistant  isolates  from  poultry,  the  use  of 
fluoroquinolones in poultry has to be monitored very 
carefully.
Conclusion

The present study reveals the occurrence of fluo-
roquinolone-resistant E. coli in healthy broiler. Some 
of the isolates are MDR. This is the first report of the 
detection of qnrS gene in E. coli isolated from healthy 
broiler chickens in Bangladesh which are resistant to 
fluoroquinolone  group  of  antibiotics.  From  poultry, 
these  resistant  bacteria  can  be  transfered  to  human 
through the food chain. It is now time to be careful in
