  ABSTRACT   The aims of this study were to determine 
the  prevalence  and  antimicrobial  resistance  of  Liste-
ria, Salmonella, and Yersinia spp. isolated from duck 
and goose intestinal contents. A total of 471 samples, 
including 291 duck and 180 goose intestinal contents, 
were  purchased  from  wet  markets  between  November 
2008 and July 2010. Listeria, Salmonella, and Yersinia
spp. were isolated from 58 (12.3%), 107 (22.7%), and 
80 (17%) of the samples, respectively. It was conclud-
ed  that  Listeria  ivanovii,  Salmonella  Thompson,  and 
Yersinia  enterocolitica  were  the  predominant  serovars 

among Listeria, Salmonella, and Yersinia spp., respec-
tively.  Moreover,  resistance  to  tetracycline  was  com-
mon in Listeria (48.3%) and Salmonella spp. (63.6%), 
whereas 51.3% of the Yersinia spp. isolates were resis-
tant to cephalothin. Therefore, continued surveillance 
of the prevalence of the pathogens and also of emerging 
antibiotic  resistance  is  needed  to  render  possible  the 
recognition of foods that may represent risks and also 
ensure  the  effective  treatment  of  listeriosis,  salmonel-
losis, and yersiniosis.

  INTRODUCTION 

  The  public  health  concern  of  microbiological  food 
safety  is  increasing  worldwide.  Listeria,  Salmonella, 
and  Yersinia  spp.  that  cause  foodborne  diseases  are 
the  common  significant  pathogens  in  terms  of  food 
safety and present a public health risk for consumers, 
especially in developing countries (Soltan-Dallal et al., 
2010; Adzitey et al., 2012; Jamali et al., 2013). Some 
studies have reported that animal origin foods are con-
sidered  as  vehicles  related  with  infections  caused  by 
Listeria, Salmonella, and Yersinia spp. (Cretikos et al., 
2008; Jamali et al., 2013). 

  Human antimicrobial treatment for listeriosis, salmo-
nellosis, and yersiniosis in most cases is not indicated. 
Although, antibiotic therapy is necessary in some criti-
cal  cases  such  as  infections  of  immune-compromised 
persons  and  extraintestinal  disease,  where  antimicro-
bial  resistance  of  the  pathogens  could  complicate  the 
treatment (Engberg et al., 2004). The use of antimicro-
bials in animal foods for the growth promotion, control, 
or  treatment  of  poultry  diseases  has  been  increased. 
However, the overuse of these antibiotics may increase 
the rates of antimicrobial resistance to several antibiot-

ics (Castanon, 2007; Mathew et al., 2007). The grow-
ing problem of antimicrobial resistance among poultry-
associated  pathogens  may  represent  a  risk  of  human 
infections with these organisms. 

  To the best of our knowledge, there is no published 
information regarding antibiotic susceptibility of Liste-
ria, Salmonella, and Yersinia spp. from ducks and geese 
in Iran. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
prevalence and antimicrobial resistance profiles of these 
foodborne pathogens isolated from duck and goose in-
testinal contents in Varamin, Tehran province, Iran. 

  MATERIALS AND METHODS 

  Sample Collection 

  A total of 471 samples, including intestinal contents 
of ducks (n = 291) and geese (n = 180), were randomly 
collected  from  different  wet  markets  located  in  Vara-
min,  Tehran  province,  Iran,  between  November  2008 
and July 2010. The samples were transferred into ster-
ile  plastic  bags  and  transported  in  an  ice  box  to  the 
laboratory within 3 h and analyzed immediately. 

  Isolation and Identification of Isolates 

Listeria spp.   In this study, the isolation and detec-
tion  of  Listeria  spp.  was  done  by  the  USDA  method

JAMALI ET AL.

(McClain and Lee, 1988). Briefly, 25 g of each sample 
was added to 225 mL of Listeria enrichment broth (Ox-
oid, Basingstoke, UK) as first enrichment broth, mixed 
for 2 min, and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Then, 1 mL 
of  Listeria  enrichment  broth  was  added  to  9  mL  of 
Fraser  broth  (Oxoid)  as  a  second  enrichment  culture 
and incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Then, enriched Fraser 
broth-culture was streaked onto Palcam agar (Oxoid) 
and Oxford agar (Oxoid) and incubated at 37°C for 24 
to 48 h. Presumptive Listeria colonies were confirmed 
by using the biochemical tests (Aygun and Pehlivanlar, 
2006) and API Listeria (bioMérieux).

Salmonella spp. The standard conventional culture 
method was used in the isolation of Salmonella spp. in 
this study as described by Varnam and Evans (1991). 
Briefly, 25 g of each sample was added to 225 mL of 
buffered peptone water (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 
mixed for 2 min and incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Then, 
0.1  mL  of  the  broth  was  added  to  10  mL  of  selenite 
cystine broth (Merck) and was incubated at 42°C over-
night.  Finally,  enriched  selenite  cystine  broth-culture 
was streaked onto Salmonella Shigella agar (Merck) and 
brilliant green agar (Merck). All plates were then incu-
bated  at  37°C  for  overnight.  Presumptive  Salmonella 
colonies were confirmed by using API 20E (bioMérieux 
20100,  Marcy  l’Etoile,  France).  Salmonella  polyvalent 
O and H antisera (Mast Diagnostics, Merseyside, UK) 
were used for agglutination tests.

Yersinia spp. Twenty-five gram of each sample was 
added  to  225  mL  of  PBS.  The  samples  were  mixed 
for  2  min  and  incubated  for  3  wk  at  4°C.  Then,  the 
cold-enriched  samples  were  subjected  to  alkali  treat-
ment by adding 0.5 mL of 0.5% KOH into 4.5 mL of 
cold-enriched  samples.  The  cold-enriched  and  alkali-
treated cultures were streaked onto cefsulodin-Irgasan-
novobiocin agar and incubated for 18 to 24 h at 25°C. 
Presumptive Yersinia colonies were confirmed by using 
the API 20E (bioMérieux 20100).

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test

All Listeria, Salmonella, and Yersinia spp. were sub-
jected to antimicrobial susceptibility tests. The Kirby-
Bauer disc diffusion method using Mueller Hinton agar 
(Oxoid) was applied to antimicrobial susceptibility test 
according  to  the  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards 
Institute  (CLSI,  2006).  However,  Muller-Hinton  agar 
supplemented  with  5%  defibrinated  sheep  blood  was 
used for Listeria spp. The following panel of antimicro-
bial agents and concentrations was applied: tetracycline 

(30 μg), gentamicin (10 μg), chloramphenicol (30 μg), 
trimethoprim  (15  μg),  ampicillin  (30  μg),  amoxicillin 
(30 μg; for all isolates); vancomycin (30 μg), rifampi-
cin (5 μg), penicillin G (10 unit), kanamycin (30 μg), 
erythromycin (15 μg), clindamycin (2 μg), amoxicillin-
clavulanic acid (20/10 μg; for Listeria spp.), streptomy-
cin (30 μg), nalidixic acid (30 μg), ciprofloxacin (5 μg), 
cephalothin (30 μg; for Yersinia spp.), and streptomy-
cin (30 μg), nalidixic acid (30 μg), ciprofloxacin (5 μg), 
and colisitin (10 μg; for Salmonella spp.).

Statistical Analysis

The relationship between the contaminated samples 
and  the  different  kinds  of  samples  was  analyzed  us-
ing chi-squared analysis. All statistical and chi-squared 
analyses were performed using SPSS 18.0 (SPSS Inc., 
Chicago, IL). A P-value < 0.05 was used for statistical 
significance.

RESULTS

The  obtained  results  showed  that  58  (12.3%),  107 
(22.7%),  and  80  (17%)  of  duck  and  goose  intestinal 
contents samples were contaminated with Listeria, Sal-
monella, and Yersinia spp., respectively.

Listeria spp.

Prevalence of Listeria spp. in Ducks and Geese. 
In  this  study,  58  (12.3%)  samples  were  contaminated 
with Listeria spp., and among them, 41 (14.1%) and 17 
(9.4%) duck and goose samples were contaminated with 
Listeria spp., respectively (Table 1). There was a sig-
nificant difference between contaminated duck samples 
and goose samples (P < 0.05). The highest prevalence 
of Listeria spp. was Listeria ivanovii (43.1%) followed 
by  Listeria  monocytogenes  (32.8%),  Listeria  innocua 
(8.6%), and Listeria seeligeri (15.5%).

Antimicrobial  Resistance  of  Listeria  spp.  Iso-
lates. The resistance profiles of Listeria spp. to 10 an-
timicrobial  agents  tested  in  this  study  are  shown  in 
Table 2. Thirty-two (55.2%) and 8 (13.8%) out of 58 
isolates of Listeria spp. were resistant to 1 and 2 an-
tibiotic  agents,  respectively.  However,  3  Listeria  spp. 
isolates  (5.2%)  showed  multidrug  resistance  (MDR; 
resistance  to  >2  antimicrobial).  Resistance  to  tetra-
cycline (48.3%) was the most common finding in this 
study,  followed  by  resistance  to  penicillin  G  (24.1%), 
erythromycin (12.1%), clindamycin (10.3%), and amox-

LISTERIA, SALMONELLA, AND YERSINIA IN DUCKS AND GEESE

1027

icillin-clavulanic acid (6.9%). All the isolates of Listeria 
spp. were susceptible to half of the antibiotic examined 
including chloramphenicol, gentamicin, vancomycin, ri-
fampicin, and kanamycin.

Salmonella spp.

Distribution of Salmonella Serovars in Ducks and 
Geese.  Out  of  107  Salmonella  spp.,  84  (78.5%)  and 
23 (21.5%) isolates were detected from duck and goose 
samples, respectively (Table 3). There was a significant 
difference between contaminated duck and goose sam-
ples (P < 0.05). The most common serovar was Salmo-
nella Thompson (65.4%). The remaining isolates were 
Salmonella Enteritidis (9.3%), Salmonella Paratyphi C 
(8.4%), Salmonella Hadar/Salmonella Virginia (7.5%), 
and Salmonella Typhimurium (1.9%).

Antimicrobial  Resistance  of  Salmonella  Se-
rovars. The resistance profiles for the 107 Salmonella 
spp. are as follows: tetracycline, 63.6%; nalidixic acid, 
40.2%; streptomycin, 29.9%; trimethoprim, 28%; amox-
icillin,  6.5%;  chloramphenicol,  4.7%;  and  ampicillin, 
3.7%. However, all the Salmonella isolates were sensi-
tive  to  colisitin,  ciprofloxacin,  and  gentamicin  (Table 
4). Thirty-five (32.7%) isolates of Salmonella spp. were 
MDR.  Multidrug  resistance  was  more  frequently  ob-
served  among  Salmonella  Thompson  as  well  as  duck 
isolates.  In  addition,  42  (39.3%)  Salmonella  spp.  iso-
lates were susceptible to all of the examined antibiotics.

Yersinia spp.

Prevalence of Yersinia spp. in Ducks and Geese. 
Of 80 Yersinia spp. isolates, 58 (72.5%) and 22 (27.5%) 
isolates were detected from duck and goose samples, re-
spectively (Table 5). The isolates of Yersinia spp. were 
identified  as  Y.  enterocolitica  (9.6%),  Y.  frederiksenii 
(4.5%),  and  Y.  intermedia  (4%).  There  was  a  signifi-
cant difference between contaminated duck and goose 
samples (P < 0.05).

Antimicrobial  Resistance  of  Yersinia  spp.  Iso-
lates. The resistance profiles for the 80 Yersinia spp. 
are  as  follows:  cephalothin,  51.3%;  ampicillin,  21.3%; 
trimethoprim, 17.5%; amoxicillin, 11.3%; ciprofloxacin, 
10%; nalidixic acid, 7.5%, streptomycin, 6.3%, and tet-
racycline, 2.9% each (see Table 6). All the isolates were 
sensitive to gentamicin and chloramphenicol. Thirteen 
(16.3%) isolates of Yersinia spp., including 8 Yersinia 
enterocolitica,  3  Yersinia  frederiksenii,  and  2  Yersinia 

intermedia isolates, were MDR. Moreover, 21 (36.3%) 
of the Yersinia spp. isolates were sensitive to all tested 
antibiotics.

DISCUSSION

Our results on the prevalence of Listeria, Salmonella, 
and  Yersinia  spp.  demonstrated  a  high  level  of  con-
tamination among purchased duck and goose samples 
in Varamin, Tehran province, Iran. Our findings are in 
agreement with earlier findings, whereby Chipilev et al. 
(2010) and Adzitey et al. (2013) isolated L. monocyto-
genes and other species of Listeria from duck products 
and intestinal contents, respectively. However, no Lis-
teria spp. was recovered from healthy indigenous ducks 
(Njagi et al., 2004). It is not clear whether ducks and 
geese are Listeria primary reservoirs or whether they 
were contaminated by environments. Several resources 
such as feces, soil, vegetation, and sewage have been re-
ported as primary reservoir for Listeria species. Listeria 
spp. can survive and be transmitted to farm equipment 
and future flocks. Isolation of L. monocytogenes in the 
current study suggests that ducks and geese could be a 
potential risk of foodborne listeriosis in customers.

The prevalence of Salmonella spp. in duck samples is 
in agreement with earlier findings in Iran (Dilmaghani 
et al., 2011), the United Kingdom (Little et al., 2008), 
and Malaysia (Adzitey et al., 2012). Moreover, our re-
sults showed the high level of Salmonella contamination 
among ducks in Iran compared with the previous reports 
in other countries such as the United States (McCrea 
et al., 2006), China (Pan et al., 2010), Taiwan (Yu et 
al., 2008), and Egypt (Osman et al., 2010). Salmonella 
prevalence in ducks from Brazil was greater than our 
study (Hofer et al., 1997; Ribeiro et al., 2004). The high 
prevalence of Salmonella spp. in ducks could depend on 
environmental exposure and contact with other animals 
in the rearing area. However, a few reports regarding 
Salmonella  prevalence  in  goose  have  been  published. 
The prevalence of Salmonella spp. (12.8%) in our study 
was less than previously reported (32.6%) in Iran (Dil-
maghani et al., 2011). Trawinska et al. (2008) and Pan 
et  al.  (2010)  have  isolated  Salmonella  spp.  in  goose 
samples in Poland and China, respectively.

Salmonella Thompson was the predominant serovar 
in  this  study  as  well  as  previously  described  in  Iran 
(Soltan-Dallal  et  al.,  2010).  It  is  also  considered  as 
one  of  the  most  common  serovars  that  causes  infec-
tion and outbreaks. Two clinically significant Salmonel-

la  serovars,  Salmonella  Typhimurium  and  Salmonella 
Enteritidis, have been frequently reported as predomi-
nant serovars in many countries (Bennasar et al., 2000; 
Little et al., 2008; Trawinska et al., 2008; Pan et al., 
2010; Osman et al., 2010; Adzitey et al., 2012). How-
ever, these serovars were not found as the predominant 
serovars in our study among duck and goose samples.

The prevalence of Yersinia spp. in foods and animals 
and its significance is still unknown in Iran (Hanifian 
and Khani, 2012). In this study, 9.6% of duck and goose 
samples  were  contaminated  by  Yersinia  spp.  To  the 
best of our knowledge, there is no published informa-
tion regarding to prevalence of Yersinia spp. in ducks 
and  geese  in  Iran.  However,  a  few  studies  have  been 
reported the prevalence of Yersinia spp. in chicken and 
beef with the rate ranged of 13 to 16% (Soltan-Dallal 
et al., 2010; Yazdi et al., 2011). Yersinia enterocolitica 
was  the  predominant  species  in  this  study  and  is  in 
agreement with earlier findings (Jiang and Kang, 2000; 
Capita et al., 2002; Soltan-Dallal et al., 2010; Yazdi et 
al., 2011; Hanifian and Khani, 2012).

Antimicrobial resistance in pathogens and therapeu-
tic  interference  is  always  a  significant  issue  in  public 
health. The investigation of susceptibility pattern and 
antibiotic resistance is important to treatment (Soltan-
Dallal et al., 2010). Antimicrobial agents that are used 
in  growth  promotion,  treatment,  or  prophylaxis  in 
poultry and broiler rearing have the potential to pro-
mote  antimicrobial  resistance  among  pathogens  pres-
ent.  Therefore,  antibiotic  resistance  strains  could  be 
transferred to humans via contaminated poultry prod-
ucts (Mayrhofer et al., 2004; Ezekiel et al., 2011).

Although only 3 isolates of Listeria spp. showed MDR 
in this study, more than half (55.2%) of all Listeria spp. 
isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic agent. 
The MDR isolates were divided into L. ivanovii (66.7%) 
and L. monocytogenes (33.3%), and the susceptibility of 
L. monocytogenes isolates were observed in gentamicin, 
chloramphenicol, vancomycin, kanamycin, and rifampi-
cin, which are in agreement with earlier findings (Hof 
and  Emmerling,  1984;  Srinivasan  et  al.,  2005;  Arslan 
and Özdemir, 2008; Conter et al., 2009). Furthermore, 
in an earlier study, susceptibility of food L. monocyto-
genes isolates to vancomycin and gentamicin also was 
reported (Harakeh et al., 2009).

In the current study, all Salmonella spp. isolates were 
sensitive  to  ciprofloxacin,  which  is  in  agreement  with 
previous studies in Iran and other countries (Mayrhofer 
et  al.,  2004;  Bhatia  et  al.,  2007;  Soltan-Dallal  et  al., 
2010). Resistance to tetracycline and cephalothin was 
greater in Salmonella and Yersinia spp., respectively. A 
high prevalence of resistance to tetracycline in Salmo-
nella was found by Yildirim et al. (2011) and Thai et al. 
(2012), whereas in an earlier study a low number of the 
pathogen showed resistance to tetracycline (Cook et al., 
2011). Furthermore, a high prevalence of resistance to 
cephalothin in Yersinia spp. was reported by Bhaduri 
and Wesley (2012) and Bolton et al. (2013). Ciprofloxa-
cin and tetracycline are used as disease treatment and

prevention, and a growth promoter in poultry rearing 
in Iran (Soltan-Dallal et al., 2010). Therefore, antimi-
crobial substances that are used for animal treatment 
could be reflected by antimicrobial resistance profile in 
foodborne pathogens.

In  summary,  the  presence  of  Listeria,  Salmonella, 
and  Yersinia  spp.  in  raw  duck  and  goose  intestinal 
contents  showed  that  consumption  of  these  kinds  of 
meats could be a potential risk of foodborne listeriosis, 
salmonellosis,  and  yersiniosis  in  consumers.  Thus,  to 
decrease  the  prevalence  of  developed  pathogen  resis-
tance, resistance monitoring and educational programs 
are  required.  Moreover,  continual  surveillance  on  the 
prevalence of the pathogens as well as on emerging an-
timicrobial resistance is needed to recognize foods that 
may represent risks and ensure the effective treatment 
of foodborne infections.
