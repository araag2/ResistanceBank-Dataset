Staphylococcus aureus, a major food-poisoning pathogen, is a common contaminant
in dairy industries worldwide, including in Brazil. We determined the occurrence of
S. aureus in ﬁve dairies in Brazil over 8 months. Of 421 samples, 31 (7.4%) were
positive for S. aureus and prevalence varied from 0 to 63.3% between dairies. Sixty-six
isolates from the 31 samples were typed by Multi-Locus Sequence Typing to determine
if these isolates were persistent or continuously reintroduced. Seven known sequence
types (STs), ST1, ST5, ST30, ST97, ST126, ST188 and ST398, and four new ST were
identiﬁed, ST3531, ST3540, ST3562 and ST3534. Clonal complex (CC) 1 (including
the four new ST), known as an epidemic clone, was the dominant CC. However, there
were no indications of persistence of particular ST. The resistance toward 11 antibiotic
compounds was assessed. Twelve proﬁles were generated with 75.8% of strains being
sensitive to all antibiotic classes and no Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains
were found. The enterotoxin-encoding genes involved in food-poisoning, e.g., sea,
sed, see, and seg were targeted by PCR. The two toxin-encoding genes, sed and
see, were not detected. Only three strains (4.5%) harbored seg and two of these
also harbored sea. Despite the isolates being Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA),
the presence of CC1 clones in the processing environment, including some harboring
enterotoxin encoding genes, is of concern and hygiene must have high priority to reduce
contamination.

INTRODUCTION

Staphylococcus aureus is an important opportunistic pathogen that can cause infections in warm-
blooded animals and is a leading cause of nosocomial infections in humans and bovine mastitis
(Peton and Le Loir, 2014). S. aureus is also one of the most common causative agents of food-
poisoning (Balaban and Rasooly, 2000; Le Loir et al., 2003; Hennekinne et al., 2012; Kadariya
et al., 2014) leading to 241,000 illnesses per year in the United States (Scallan et al., 2011) and
is one of the main agents implicated in foodborne diseases in Brazil (Gomes et al., 2013). In foods,
enterotoxigenic strains of S. aureus can produce heat-stable and protease resistant staphylococcal

S. aureus in Brazilian Dairy Industry

enterotoxins (SE) causing one of the most common foodborne
intoxications (Balaban and Rasooly, 2000; Dinges et al., 2000;
Le Loir et al., 2003; Argudín et al., 2010) leading to rapid
clinical symptoms such as abdominal cramps, nausea, emesis,
and diarrhea (Le Loir et al., 2003; Murray, 2005). More than
20 distinct SE have been described to date including SEA and
SED (Jones et al., 2002; Asao et al., 2003; Kérouanton et al.,
2007; Pinchuk et al., 2010; Sato’o et al., 2014; Solano et al.,
2014; Arfatahery et al., 2016) responsible for the majority of
staphylococcal food-poisoning (SFP), and also in fewer cases SEB,
SEC, SEE, SEG, SEH, and SEI (Chen et al., 2004; Ikeda et al., 2005;
Ostyn et al., 2010; Pinchuk et al., 2010). In 2012, 346 outbreaks
caused by SE were reported in Europe (EFSA and ECDC, 2014).
However, not every S. aureus strains carry SE-encoding genes
(Lindberg et al., 2000; Le Loir et al., 2003) and the risk for human
beings from diﬀerent S. aureus may thus vary.

Staphylococcus aureus has been isolated from several foods
including several ready-to-eat products (Asao et al., 2003; van
Loo et al., 2007; Schmid et al., 2009; Ostyn et al., 2010; Rizek et al.,
2011; Baumgartner et al., 2014; Hao et al., 2015) and improper
staﬀ hygiene as well as poor surface sanitation are some of the
main causes of cross-contamination (Hatakka et al., 2000; Asao
et al., 2003; Lues and Van Tonder, 2007; André et al., 2008).
S. aureus is capable of surviving on dry stainless steel and it can
easily be transferred from sponges to stainless steel surfaces and
subsequently to food products (Kusumaningrum et al., 2003). In
the dairy industry, S. aureus can be introduced at almost every
step of the production. Beside handlers and environment, the
raw milk can be one route of introduction as a consequence of
subclinical or clinical bovine mastitis. S. aureus can be shed into
the milk (Kérouanton et al., 2007; Peton and Le Loir, 2014) and
produce SE which represents one of the most common food safety
concerns from raw milk products (Fagundes et al., 2010; Silveira-
Filho et al., 2014). In addition, SE can be produced in the product
during storage if conditions allow growth of S. aureus.

Dairy production is an important

industry worldwide.
In Brazil, up to 30% of the milk production comes from
small producers (Lee et al., 2012) and soft cheeses such
as Minas frescal type are widely consumed. This particular
cheese is non-ripened semi-fat and high moisture (Saboya
et al., 1998) which oﬀers suitable growth conditions for many
pathogens including S. aureus that has frequently been the
cause of
foodborne diseases (Veras et al., 2008). In 1996,
the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture (MAPA) implemented
microbiological regulations for cheeses, subsequently extending
speciﬁc maximum S. aureus contamination levels (e.g., 103
CFU/g for coagulase positive staphylococci) for Minas frescal
cheese (Ministério da Agricultura Brasil, 1997). However, our
knowledge regarding S. aureus occurrence in Brazilian dairy
plants is still limited.

Besides food-poisoning, S. aureus is a major concern due to its
ability to acquire antibiotic resistance genes and to disseminate
and to withstand treatment (Khan et al., 2000a,b; Holden et al.,
2004; de Lencastre et al., 2007; Pesavento et al., 2007). Methicillin-
resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains are responsible
for the majority of nosocomial infection worldwide (ECDC, 2014;
EFSA and ECDC, 2014) and there is an increase in MRSA

detection in the community, livestock environment and food
(Normanno et al., 2007; van Loo et al., 2007; EFSA and ECDC,
2014). Thus, despite being mostly problematic in infection, it
raises concern that foods could potentially also be a vehicle
of antibiotic resistant S. aureus strains. Epidemiological studies
have been used to track the contamination origin and the
diversity of clinical isolates for many years. However, particular
focus has been on MRSA isolates (Chambers and Deleo, 2009).
Randomly ampliﬁed polymorphic DNA (RAPD) has been used
to determine the relatedness of S. aureus from cattle, pigs,
chickens, and humans (Lee, 2003) concluding that humans can
acquire MRSA infections from livestock via contaminated food
products. This reinforces that contamination of dairy processing
environment, milk and dairy products by S. aureus is a public
health concern (Fagundes et al., 2010; Oliveira et al., 2011).
However, few studies have assessed the global epidemiology of
S. aureus of animal origin and their dissemination into the food
chain (Lee et al., 2012; Sobral et al., 2012; Lima et al., 2013).
Diﬀerent from RAPD and among the various molecular typing
methods, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) (Enright et al.,
2000) provides global epidemiology data. Indeed, MLST can
be used to track contamination sources, to indicate persistence
of particular clones and to identify epidemic clones. However,
studies investigating the molecular characteristic of S. aureus
from dairy processing environment and dairy products in Brazil
are scarce.

The objectives of this study were: (i) to estimate the incidence
of S. aureus contamination in the Brazilian dairy industry of
the Southeast and Midwest regions, (ii) to determine the genetic
diversity of the isolates by MLST as well as to evaluate their
reoccurrence and eventually persistence, and (iii) to assess some
of the virulence factors involved in health risk such as antibiotic
resistance spreading by determining the antibiotic proﬁle, the
hemolytic trend potential and to investigate the possible food-
poisoning ability of the isolates by detecting the presence of
enterotoxin encoding genes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Bacterial Strains and Growth Media
Staphylococcus aureus isolates collected from Brazilian dairies
were investigated in this study (Supplementary Table 1) and
sampled as described in Section “Sampling Procedure and
Detection of Putative S. aureus.” Isolation and phenotypic tests
were performed using Brain–Heart Infusion (BHI) broth (Oxoid,
United Kingdom), BHI agar [BHI broth, 1.5% agar (AppliChem,
Germany)], Tryptic Soy Broth [TSB (Oxoid, United Kingdom)],
Tryptic Soy Agar [TSA (Oxoid, United Kingdom)] supplemented
with 0.6% yeast extract (TSAYE), DNase Test Agar with
Methyl Green (Difco, Detroit, MI, United States), Mueller
Hinton II Agar [MHA (BD Diagnostics, Franklin Lakes, NJ,
United States)], Mannitol Salt Agar (MSA) and Baird Parker agar
(Oxoid, United Kingdom) supplemented with egg-yolk emulsion
(BP). Blood agar was prepared by supplementing TSA with
deﬁbrinated sheep blood (Statens Serum Institut, Denmark) at
5% (vol/vol). Unless otherwise speciﬁed, isolates were grown

at 37◦C and liquid cultures were incubated under shaking
conditions at 250 rpm. The isolates were stored in BHI containing
20% (vol/vol) glycerol (Merck, Germany) at −80◦C.

Processing Plants and Sample Collection
Five dairy processing plants in São Paulo state and Minas Gerais
state (Southeast region) and Goiás state (Midwest region) in
Brazil were sampled over an 8 months period from December
2013 to July 2014. In São Paulo state, two dairy plants were
evaluated, one small-scale with a volume of 7,000 L cow’s milk
processed per day from 60 producing farms, and the other of
medium-scale that processed nearly 60,000 L per day collected
from 150 farms. Two out of the three sampled dairies in Goiás
state were small-scale dairies, processing about 3,000 L per day
provided by around 30 farms. The third dairy was an artisanal
cheese manufacturing plant, producing about 50 cheeses per day,
using 250 L per day, supplied by just one cattle herd, raised on
site where the cheese factory is located and using unpasteurized
milk. Four categories of samples were investigated: raw material
(bulked raw milk, pasteurized milk, brine, curd), food-contact
surfaces (milk ﬁlter, vats, spatulas, paddle, knife, tank, picking
machine strainer, hand handler, worker gloves, cheese box, shelf,
gallon of milk, cloth mold, mold, plastic crates, curd tube,
tables), non-food contact surfaces (pallet, wall, ﬂoor, drain, water,
cleaning brush, sink, tables, gloves, and staﬀ’s boot), and ﬁnal
product (cheese surfaces, cheese) as shown in Table 1 and
Supplementary Table 1. The ﬁve dairies followed the same cheese
processing procedure using milk and no lactic acid bacteria in the
production. The milk was pasteurized except in one dairy where
they used unpasteurized milk and it was chosen to represent this
type of Brazilian dairy (corresponding to 20–40% of dairies in this
country).

Sampling Procedure and Detection of
Putative S. aureus
A total of 421 samples were collected at diﬀerent stages of
processing following the method described by Oxaran et al.
(2017). Brieﬂy, raw material (n = 46), food-contact surfaces
(n = 161), non-food-contact surfaces (n = 96), and products
(n = 118) (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1) were sampled
using swab or sponge or by taking 25 g of cheese. Samples were
transferred to the laboratory in cooling boxes containing ice
packs. Homogenized samples in PSW were diluted 10-fold and
0.1 mL plated on BP to isolate putative S. aureus. After 24–48 h
incubation at 35◦C, up to three characteristic colonies of S. aureus
(typical black, convex colonies, and with halo) were puriﬁed on
TSAYE and incubated at 35◦C for 24–48 h. Putative S. aureus
isolates were stored for further analysis.

Phenotypic Tests
Shape and motility was determined by microscopy using an
Olympus microscope (BX51). Gram-reaction was assessed by
the 3% KOH method (Halebian et al., 1981). Catalase was
tested using 3% hydrogen peroxide (Merck, Germany). Mannose
fermentation and tolerance to high salt concentration was
assessed on MSA incubated at 35◦C for 48 h (Chapman, 1945).

DNase activity was tested on DNase Test Agar with Methyl Green
incubated at 35◦C for 48 h. The production of free coagulase
(Essers and Radebold, 1980) was tested using rabbit plasma
(BioRad, France) and the presence of clumping factor as well as
Protein A were tested using the Pastorex Staph−Plus Kit (BioRad,
France) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

DNA Manipulation
Genomic DNA was extracted using the Dynabeads R(cid:13) DNA
DIRECT Universal kit (Invitrogen) on a 24 h culture. For each
PCR reaction, 1 µL of extracted genomic DNA was used with
primers listed in Table 2. PCR for the species identiﬁcation and
MLST were performed using the TEMPase Hot Start 2X Master
Mix Blue II (Ampliqon, Denmark) and the Maxima Hot Start
Taq Polymerase (Fermentas, Waltham, MA, United States) was
used for toxin-encoding gene ampliﬁcation, both were performed
in a 25 µL reaction following the manufacturer’s instruction.
Reactions were done in a Veriti Thermal Cycler (Applied
Biosystems, 96 Well Model 9902). PCR products were puriﬁed
using 10 U Exonuclease I (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham,
MA, United States) and 0.5 U Fast Alkaline Phosphatase (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, United States) and incubated
at 37◦C for 15 min followed by an inactivation step at 85◦C for
15 min (Werle et al., 1994). Macrogen Europe (The Netherlands)
sequenced the gene fragments using the same primer used for the
PCR ampliﬁcation.

S. aureus Species Conﬁrmation
The S. aureus identiﬁcation was conﬁrmed by 16S rRNA gene
sequencing using primers 27F (Lane, 1991) and 1492R (Turner
et al., 1999) (Table 2). The consensus sequence for each 16S rRNA
locus was analyzed using the BLASTn algorithm on National
Center for Biotechnology1.

Multi-locus Sequence Typing
The sequence type (ST) of each S. aureus isolate was determined
by the method described by Enright et al.
(2000). The
internal fragment of seven housekeeping genes arcC (Carbamate
kinase), aroE (shikimate dehydrogenase), glpF (glycerol kinase),
gmk (guanylate kinase), pta (phosphate acetyltransferase),
tpi (triosephosphate isomerase), yqiL (acetyle coenzyme A
acetyltransferase), was ampliﬁed by PCR following the guideline
on http://pubmlst.org/saureus/. The sequences were processed
using CLC Main Workbench 7 (CLC Bio-Qiagen, Denmark) and
analyzed using the S. aureus MLST database2 to assign the allele
type and thus the ST. The proﬁles obtained including the new
alleles and new proﬁles were submitted to the MLST database to
contribute to the resource for S. aureus global epidemiology.

Virulence Factor Phenotypes
Hemolytic Activity
Hemolytic activity was tested on blood agar incubated at 35◦C
for 48 h and classiﬁed as α−hemolytic (partial hemolysis),

Antibiotic Susceptibility
Overnight cultures were adjusted to 0.5 McFarland (Biomerieux,
France) suspensions (corresponding to 1–3 × 108 CFU/mL) and
were inoculated by swabbing onto MHA in 120 mm × 120 mm
Petri dishes (Almeco, Denmark). Eleven antibiotic disks (Oxoid,
United Kingdom), Penicillin G (PEN, 10 U), Erythromycin
(ERM, 15 µg), Tetracycline (TET, 30 µg), Clindamycin (CLIN,
2 µg), Gentamicin (GEN, 10 µg), Ciproﬂoxacin (CIP, 5 µg),
Vancomycin (VAN, 5 µg), Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole
(SXT, 25 µg), Chloramphenicol (CAM, 30 µg), Cefoxitin (CEF,

30 µg), Bacitracin (BAC, 10 U) were tested. The diameter of
inhibition zones was determined after 16–20 h and after 24 h
of incubation at 35◦C. The interpretation of the inhibition zone
diameters was based on the EUCAST values (EUCAST, 2015)
except for bacitracin and vancomycin inhibition zones which
were compared to the Food and Drug Administration guidelines
(FDA, 2006, 2009). S. aureus ATCC 25923 was used as control
strain.

Toxin-Encoding Gene Detection
The presence of the genes encoding four toxins found in SFP was
determined by PCR using the primers listed in Table 2. The most
two common toxin encoding genes involved in SFP, sea and sed,

and also the not so common SFP toxin encoding genes, see and
seg, were targeted. The S. aureus strains ATCC 29213 (sea, seg),
DSM 18588 (sed), DSM 18589 (see) were used as positive controls.

RESULTS

S. aureus Is a Contaminant of the
Brazilian Dairy Industry
Thirty-one of 421 samples were positive for S. aureus
(Supplementary Table 1). Strains were isolated from between
3 and 5 colonies from each sample showing typical S. aureus
colony macroscopy on Baird Parker plates. A total of 66 isolates
were identiﬁed as S. aureus being Gram positive, cocci shaped
cells, catalase positive, DNase positive, growing in presence
of high salt concentration, fermenting mannitol, as well as
producing free and bound coagulase. The 16S rRNA gene
sequencing conﬁrmed the S. aureus identiﬁcation for all 66
isolates. Four out of ﬁve dairies were positive for S. aureus,
leading to an overall contamination rate of 7.4% (n = 31).
The average contamination rate varied among dairies from 0%
(n = 0) in Dairy 1 to 63.3% (n = 19) in Dairy 2 (Table 3). The
dairies 3, 4 and 5, had contamination rates of 8.3% (n = 5),
1.2% (n = 2), and 3.6% (n = 5), respectively. Based on the
overall contamination rate of S. aureus positive samples (n = 31),
S. aureus was isolated in all four sampling categories (Table 3):
raw material (10.9%), product (7.6%), food-contact surfaces
(8.1%), and non-food-contact surfaces (4.2%).

Prevalence of CC1 S. aureus Isolates in
the Brazilian Dairy Industry
Using MLST, the 66 S. aureus isolates were separated into 11 ST
which were grouped into six clonal complexes (CCs) (Table 4).
Of the 66 isolates, only 19 could be assigned to a known ST: ST1
(n = 7), ST188 (n = 3), ST97 (n = 3), ST398 (n = 2), ST5 (n = 1),
ST30 (n = 2), and ST126 (n = 1). Besides the seven known ST,
four new ST were found according to the MLST database2. The
four new STs were assigned to 47 of the isolates. Due to a single
point mutation, the new ST3531 (n = 41), ST3534 (n = 1), and
ST3540 (n = 2) harbored a new allele type of the yqiL locus, 508,
gmk locus, 291, or glpF locus, 515, respectively. All new allele
types and thus ST were recorded on the MLST database. All of
the seven allele types of the new ST, ST3562 (n = 3), were already
assigned but the concatenation was novel and the isolate proﬁle
was submitted to the MLST database.

Heterogeneous Distribution of ST among
the Dairies
ST3531 (n = 41) and ST3540 (n = 2) were only found in Dairy
2 with ST3531 being the predominant type (n = 41 out of 44
positive isolates). In this dairy, ST398 (n = 1) was also found. The
ST3562 (n = 3) as well as ST5 (n = 1) and ST126 (n = 1) were
speciﬁc to Dairy 3 and ST1 (n = 4) and ST97 (n = 2) were also
identiﬁed. ST188 (n= 3), ST3534 (n= 1), and ST398 (n= 1) were
isolated in Dairy 4. Dairy 5 was contaminated with ST1 (n = 3),
ST30 (n = 2), and ST97 (n = 1).

Does S. aureus Reoccur and Persist in
the Brazilian Dairy Industry?
The assigned ST were compared to the sampling points in each
dairy and there was no correlation between particular ST at one
speciﬁc sampling point. However, ST3531 was found at many
diﬀerent sampling points (wall, curd, cloth mold, cheese surface,
sink, handler’s hand, ﬂoor, brine, processing tank, cheese, and
paddle) in Dairy 2 (Supplementary Table 2). ST1 was found
at two diﬀerent sampling points both in Dairy 3 (curd and
unpasteurized milk) and in Dairy 5 (bucket and cold chamber
shelf). The results also showed that one sampling point, the
unpasteurized milk (Dairy 3) was contaminated with S. aureus
of three diﬀerent ST (ST1, ST126, ST97). The ST were compared
to the sampling time points in each dairy. Only ST1 and ST30 in
Dairy 3 and 5, respectively, were occurring at two diﬀerent time
points indicating a re-introduction of these ST.

Virulence Related Phenotypes
Hemolytic Activity
Out of the 66 isolates, 29 lysed the red blood cells completely
and were β-hemolytic. Thirteen strains were α-hemolytic.
Twenty-three isolates produced a weak α(cid:48)-hemolytic zone and
one isolate (Sa8) did not display hemolytic activity, being
γ−hemolytic (Supplementary Table 2).
Antibiotic Susceptibility
The 66 isolates were all
susceptible to four antibiotics:
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, cefoxitin, and
bacitracin (Table 5). Resistance toward one or more antibiotics
was observed for 24.2% of the isolates (n = 16). Seven isolates
were only resistant to one antibiotic being either ciproﬂoxacin
(1.5%, n = 1) or penicillin G (9.1%, n = 6). Combination of
resistance toward two to four antibiotics was observed for nine
isolates (13.6%) (Table 5). None of the 66 isolates were methicillin
resistant. No isolates were resistant to vancomycin but 21 isolates
showed an intermediate tolerance to this antibiotic. One of
the vancomycin intermediate tolerant isolates (Sa44) was also
intermediate tolerant to tetracycline (Supplementary Table 2).

Detection of Food-Poisoning Related Toxin-Encoding
Genes
Using PCR, none of the isolates was positive for detection of gene
encoding toxins D and E, e.g., sed and see respectively. Three
isolates out of 66 were positive for seg, including two isolates
harboring both genes seg and sea (Supplementary Table 2).

DISCUSSION

Minas frescal cheese is a widely consumed soft cheese in Brazil
and it has been associated with S. aureus food-poisoning (de
Almeida Filho and Nader Filho, 2000; Araújo et al., 2002).
Most of the dairies investigated in the present study were
positive for S. aureus. This is in concordance with the general
trend that this pathogen is a common contaminant of dairy
industries worldwide, including Brazil (de Almeida Filho and
Nader Filho, 2000; Araújo et al., 2002; Carvalho et al., 2007;

Sensitivity (S), intermediate tolerance (I), and resistance (R) was determined for all 11 antibiotics tested: Penicillin G (PEN), Erythromycin (ERM), Tetracycline (TET),
Clindamycin (CLIN), Gentamicin (GEN), Ciproﬂoxacin (CIP), Vancomycin (VAN), Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (SXT), Chloramphenicol (CAM), Cefoxitin (CEF), and

rates can reach up to 77.0% (Araújo et al., 2002; André et al.,
2008; Moraes et al., 2009). Here, we identiﬁed one dairy with
a high level of contamination (63.3%, Dairy 2). The four other
dairies had a lower contamination rate (from 0 to 8.3%) which

is similar to the rate described by Lee et al. (2012) but lower
than generally reported in the literature (Araújo et al., 2002).
S. aureus was identiﬁed in all four sampling categories (raw
material, product, food-contact surfaces, and non-food-contact
surfaces) but the contamination rates varied. The highest overall

Dittmann et al.

S. aureus in Brazilian Dairy Industry

contamination rate was observed for the raw material category
(10.9%), however, only two out of the ﬁve dairies were positive
for S. aureus presence in this category. This included S. aureus
isolation from the milk in the only dairy producing cheese from
unpasteurized milk (Dairy 3), however this type of dairy did
not show the highest contamination rate of any of the other
sampling categories. Contamination of raw milk by S. aureus has
previously been reported and linked to milk from animals with
mastitis (Jørgensen et al., 2005; da Costa Krewer et al., 2015).
The frequency of S. aureus contamination of dairy cows is quite
high in Brazil (da Costa Krewer et al., 2015) and this could
also be one of the contamination sources for Dairy 3. However,
this is likely not the only pathogen introduction route for all
of the investigated dairies. The overall contamination rates of
the food-contact surfaces and products were slightly lower than
that of the raw material. Nevertheless, at least one food-contact
surface sample was positive for S. aureus in all of the dairies
where the pathogen was detected. S. aureus was also isolated
from the handler’s hands, gloves, and utensils in three of the
dairies (Dairy 2, 4, and 5). Several studies have reported that
contamination by S. aureus is mainly due to transfer between
handlers and the equipment thus incriminating the lack of
good manufacturing practices (GMPs) (Lee et al., 2012; Kümmel
et al., 2016). Altogether, it hints towards a human spread of the
pathogen in the investigated dairies and a need for improvement
in the hygienic practices. However, further monitoring is needed
to conﬁrm this speculation.

We typed the S. aureus isolates choosing MLST among the
diﬀerent epidemiological methods that have previously been
applied to study the relatedness of S. aureus isolates in food
production plants (Tondo et al., 2000; Lee, 2003; Kérouanton
et al., 2007; Rabello et al., 2007; Agersø et al., 2012; Lee et al.,
2012; Yan et al., 2012; Shepheard et al., 2013; Rešková et al.,
2014; McMillan et al., 2016). Indeed, MLST provide data that
can be compared on a global scale and allow typing of important
S. aureus clones such as ST398 involved in human and animal
infections that are non-typable by the standard PFGE method
(using smaI) due to DNA methylation (Bens et al., 2006). The
66 isolates identiﬁed in this study belonged to six diﬀerent CC
and to seven known ST (ST1, ST5, ST30, ST97, ST126, ST188,
and ST398) and four new ST (ST3531, ST3534, ST3540, ST3562).
According to the MLST database2 and previous studies on milk
and dairy products, all of the known ST have previously been
isolated in Brazil (Vivoni et al., 2006; Rabello et al., 2007; Silva
et al., 2013, 2014). In three instances, more than one ST was
identiﬁed from one single sample, e.g., ST3531 and ST3540 being
identiﬁed from the same cheese surface sample (Supplementary
Table 2), which shows that more than one S. aureus clone were
present and thereby supports the requirement of analyzing more
than one colony per sample (Mongkolrattanothai et al., 2011;
Votintseva et al., 2014). We did not ﬁnd any indications of
persistence as it has been seen in other studies (Koreˇnová et al.,
2015) but our results indicate that S. aureus was continuously
reintroduced into the dairies.

The majority of the isolates (44 out of 66) including the four
novel ST belonged to CC1. Although several other studies have
found large diversity regarding S. aureus contamination (Oliveira

et al., 2016), Silva et al. (2013) also found that CC1 (ST1) was
the main contaminant of milk from Brazilian cows infected with
mastitis due to MSSA and also identiﬁed a new ST belonging
to CC1. So far, the clinically related data represents the largest
amount of available data on S. aureus epidemiology in Brazil and
using other molecular typing methods, it has been shown that the
genetic diversity of this pathogen in Brazilian hospitals is limited
(Teixeira et al., 1995) and thus is in concordance with our results
observing a low genetic diversity as well as the predominance of
the CC1. All together it reinforces that clinical clones are now
spreading into other niches and potentially into the food industry
(Pesavento et al., 2007; Choudhury et al., 2012). In addition,
isolates from diﬀerent sampling points in one dairy (Dairy 2)
belonged to the same ST3531, being per se epidemiologically
related and thus suggesting a potential dissemination of one
clone in the dairy. Investigating S. aureus from milk and the
milking environment in São Paulo by PFGE (Lee et al., 2012),
reached the same conclusion. To a lesser extent, the other ST
belonging to diﬀerent CC observed in this study have been
sporadically reported in bovine dairy or products. Of concern,
ST398 has previously been described as a human public health
threat in Europe due to its ability to disseminate in humans
and pigs (Armand-Lefevre et al., 2005; Voss et al., 2005; Price
et al., 2012) as well as its potential antibiotic resistance pattern.
In Brazil, MRSA ST398 has been reported in bovine mastitis
(Silva et al., 2014). The two ST398 isolates found in this study
were MSSA, and in China, MSSA ST398 has also been found
in food products (Yan et al., 2014; Li et al., 2015b). Although
the main pathogenicity determinants of MSSA ST398 are still
unknown, the presence of these isolates along the food processing
chain is of concern for human health. Indeed, MSSA ST398 has
recently been involved in human infections (Valentin-Domelier
et al., 2011; Mediavilla et al., 2012; David et al., 2013). In
previous reports from Brazilian dairies, ST1, ST97, and ST126
were commonly identiﬁed (Rabello et al., 2007; Silva et al.,
2013; Oliveira et al., 2016) and ST97 has also been found in
dairies worldwide (Smith et al., 2005). ST126 that belongs to
CC126 is usually associated with ruminants but not humans
(Smith et al., 2005; Aires-de-Sousa et al., 2007; Rabello et al.,
2007), hence, suggesting a bovine origin for those isolates. The
ST5/CC5 was originally described in poultry infections but it
can also be found among human isolates (Lowder et al., 2009).
Moreover, ST5 was also present in dairy environments in the
US (Matyi et al., 2013) and in the Brazilian dairy industry
(Silva et al., 2013). Highlighted by those results, ST found
in the dairy plants investigated here belonged to ST or CC
previously involved into food-poisoning (ST1, ST5, ST30, and
ST188) worldwide (Cha et al., 2006; Yan et al., 2012; Li et al.,
2015a).

Le Loir et al. (2003) have reported that 25% of S. aureus
strains isolated from food are enterotoxigenic and staphylococcal
enterotoxins are responsible for
food-poisoning outbreaks
worldwide including from dairy products (Do Carmo et al.,
2004; Loncarevic et al., 2005). Here, a small number of strains
(4.5%) harbored SE-encoding genes involved in SFP. The
number of strains harboring SE-encoding genes varies, especially
depending on the geographical area (Jørgensen et al., 2005;

Neder et al., 2011; Riva et al., 2015) and has ranged from 0
to 93.6% (Do Carmo et al., 2004; Fagundes et al., 2010; Rall
et al., 2014; Silveira-Filho et al., 2014). SEA is the most prevalent
toxin involved in SFP worldwide and sea as well as seb were
the predominant SE-encoding genes found to cause SFP in
Brazil (Veras et al., 2008). Here, only two isolates harbored sea,
which is less frequent than previously reported. The second
SE-encoding gene found in three isolates was seg. The seg/sei
genes were recently reported to be the most prevalent among
mastitis milking cows and cheese manufacturing in Brazil (Arcuri
et al., 2010; Silveira-Filho et al., 2014). Linking ST to toxin gene
presence, only ST5 and ST30 strains harbored SE-encoding genes
in this study. In fact, assessing the MLST proﬁle to the toxigenic
potential of S. aureus food sources in China (Chang et al., 2016)
has illustrated the speciﬁc ability of ST5 strains to harbor and to
produce SE while the other ST, including ST1, ST188, ST97 and
ST398, did not, as we also noticed.

Staphylococcus aureus

is known for its ability to gain
antimicrobial resistance and attention has been given to multi-
drug as well as methicillin resistant strains and in particular to
highly virulent MRSA strains. Several studies have shown that
about 20% of the isolates were MRSA (Türkyilmaz et al., 2010;
Riva et al., 2015), with in particular in Brazil methicillin resistance
occurrence ranges from 5.5 to 37.2% in milk, dairy processing
environment and dairy products (André et al., 2008; Silveira-
Filho et al., 2014; Oliveira et al., 2016). However in this study,
none of the isolates were classiﬁed as MRSA which corroborates
with one previous study (Silveira-Filho et al., 2014). Additionally,
no isolates were resistant toward vancomycin concurring with
previous reports in the Brazilian dairy industry (André et al.,
2008; Silveira-Filho et al., 2014; Oliveira et al., 2016). Hence,
there are yet no indications of any multi-drug resistant MRSA
emerging in the Brazilian dairy industry. The highest resistance
rates were observed for penicillin G (20.9%), erythromycin
(9.0%), and tetracycline (9.0%) similar to ﬁndings by Oliveira
et al. (2016). Resistance to penicillin is frequently found in
dairy herds worldwide, the occurrence rates ranging from 10
to 70% of the isolates being resistant with in particular 47.6%
in Uruguay and Argentina (Calvinho et al., 2002; Gianneechini
et al., 2002) as well as 69.9% in Brazil (André et al., 2008).
However, resistance to the widespread administration of these
speciﬁc antibiotics to control and treat infections in dairy farms
including mammary infections reached lower value here. Thus,
in this speciﬁc region the use of β-lactams as antibiotic treatment
may have only triggered the increase of resistance occurrence to
β-lactams such as penicillin. Moreover, the co-resistance pattern
of tetracycline and macrolide (erythromycin) has frequently been
detected in ST1 (MRSA) in Italy (Battisti et al., 2010; Franco
et al., 2011; Carfora et al., 2015) which corroborates with our
data. Clindamycin, gentamicin, and ciproﬂoxacin are commonly
used in Brazil to treat bovine mastitis and it has been suggested

that these antibiotics trigger a selective pressure in dairy farms.
Indeed, all of the isolates from dairy farms in Northeastern Brazil
collected by Silveira-Filho et al. (2014) were resistant toward
gentamicin and bacitracin. However, the resistance observed
toward these antibiotics was very limited here as also observed by
others (André et al., 2008). Nevertheless, the resistance to more
than one antibiotic of some isolates, observed here, could pave
the way of the resistant determinant dissemination.

CONCLUSION

Some Brazilian dairy processing plants and cheese products have
frequent occurrence of S. aureus. The genetic diversity is low and
could indicate a few sources of contamination and, if identiﬁed
could form the basis for an intervention strategy.
