Abstract
The rate of the rise of drug resistance among pathogens in China is the fastest in the world. How-
ever, the resistance patterns for Salmonella serovars remain unknown. This study aimed to
describe the resistance patterns for Salmonella serovars and conﬁrm possible associations between
antibiotic resistance and genes in connection to serovars. Five Salmonella serotypes were identi-
ﬁed, with S. typhi (41.67%), S. enteritidis (20.83%) and S. typhimurium (18.75%) being the three
most common strains. The majority of the Salmonella strains (93.75%) were resistant to one or
more antimicrobial compounds. Multidrug resistance was only found in Salmonella from chicken,
whereas isolates from pork were only resistant to tetracycline. Eight of 11 resistance genes were
detected. Eight Salmonella isolates could transfer resistance genes to the recipient strain. These
results indicated that the Salmonella isolates were resistant to more than one type of antibiotic,
and resistance could be transmitted to humans through animal-based foods.

Practical applications
Salmonella is one of the world’s most important food-borne pathogens. This study investigated Sal-
monella and drug resistance in fresh chicken and pork from the market to describe the resistance
patterns for Salmonella serovars. The majority of the Salmonella strains were resistant to one or
more antimicrobial compounds. Some Salmonella isolates could transfer resistance genes to Esche-
richia coli. Therefore, this study has signiﬁcant application value for understanding the security
situation of animal food and strengthening surveillance of food-borne zoonotic pathogens along
the food chain.

1 | BACKGROUND

Salmonella is one of the world’s most important food-borne pathogens.
More than 2,500 serovars comprise the Salmonella genus (Evangelo-

poulou, Kritas, Govaris, & Burriel, 2013), and new serovars are regularly

described (Guibourdenche et al., 2010). Despite the many measures

currently implemented in food production, salmonellosis is the second

most commonly reported zoonosis. In the United States, S. enterica has

caused approximately one million cases of food-borne illness and 378

deaths per year (Scallan et al., 2011). The European Food Safety
Authority (EFSA) has estimated that the overall economic burden
caused by human cases in the EU can reach as high as 3 billion euros
per year (Pires, Vigre, Makela, & Hald, 2010).

An increasing number of antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella has
been reported from chicken, pork and other foods (Fearnley, Raupach,
Lagala, & Cameron, 2011; Mąka, Maćkiw, Scie_zynska, Pawłowska, &
Popowska, 2014; Padungtod & Kaneene, 2006). Studies have shown
that antibiotic treatment may prolong the course of illness of infected
animals and release pathogenic bacteria (Weir, Martin, Poppe,
Coombes, & Boerlin, 2008). According to epidemiological studies on

The livestock and poultry breeding industry of Changchun is highly

lines (GB 4789.1-2010). Samples (25 g each) were cut by sterile scis-

developed. Many livestock and poultry processing enterprises are

found in this area, including the largest pig and chicken slaughtering

and processing production base in China. Pork and chicken account for

about 80% of meat consumption in Changchun. The city slaughters

more than 2 million pigs and more than 130 million chickens per year.
Pork and chicken are major ingredients in most of the local dishes in
Changchun.

2 | OBJECTIVES

In this study, we investigated Salmonella and drug resistance in fresh
chicken and pork from supermarkets and free markets in Changchun,
Jilin Province, to describe the resistance patterns for Salmonella sero-
vars. We also aimed to conﬁrm possible statistical associations
between antibiotic resistance patterns and genes in connection to
serovars. We selected positive isolates to transfer resistance genes via
conjugative transfer of plasmids to Escherichia coli; analyzed correla-
tions between serotype, drug resistance phenotypes and drug resist-
ance genes of Salmonella; located the resistance genes of Salmonella;
and determined the relationship between resistance genes and mobile
genetic elements. The obtained data were used to establish a scientiﬁc
basis for risk assessment of Salmonella in food.

3 | MATERIAL S AND METHODS

3.1 | Sampling

The isolates used in this study were collected monthly from pork
(n 5 85) and chicken (n 5 200) at retail stores in Changchun, China. The
pork and chicken samples were made by diﬀerent processors and
obtained from 23 markets. The sampling strategy used was established
by the National Agricultural Sector Standard of China, Sampling crite-
rion for the monitoring of veterinary drug residues in animals and ani-

sors, placed in a stomacher bag containing 225 mL of buﬀered peptone
water, homogenized using a stomacher and incubated at 36 6 1 8C for
8–18 h. Subsequently, 1 mL was transferred to 10 mL of selenite cys-
tine broth and incubated at 36 6 1 8C for 18–24 h. Plating was carried
out on XLD agar, and plates were incubated at 36 6 1 8C for 18–24 h.
The typical colonies of Salmonella on the plates were pink with a black

center. In this study, PCR was used to identify the isolates. The forward
primesequence: 50-gtgaaattatcgccacgttcgggcaa-30, The reverse prime
sequence: 50-tcatcgcaccgtcaaaggaacc-30. The length of product is 284
bp (El-Aziz, 2013). Slide agglutination was used for O and H antigens
to serotype the Salmonella isolates according to the Kauﬀmann–White
scheme (Kim et al., 2006).

3.3 | Antimicrobial susceptibility test

At present, oﬂoxacin (ﬂuoroquinolone antibiotic), cephalosporin drugs
(b-lactam antibiotics) and gentamicin (GEN; aminoglycoside antibiotic)
are the domestic ﬁrst-line drugs in the clinical treatment of Salmonella

infection. Tetracyclines (TETs) are commonly used drugs for livestock

and poultry feeding processes. All isolates used in this study were tested
for susceptibility to four antimicrobial drugs on Mueller–Hinton agar by
disk diﬀusion (Emilson, 1977). The following disks were used: cefotax-
ime sodium (CTX; 30 lg), GEN (10 lg), levoﬂoxacin (LVX; 5 lg) and TET
(30 lg). The zones of inhibition were divided into sensitive, intermediate
susceptibility or resistant according to the CLSI recommendations (Wil-

liamson et al., 2012). The results were explained according to the CLSI

recommendations. The quality control strain was E. coli ATCC 25922.

3.4 | PCR detection of resistance genes

A single colony of each isolate on the agar plates was retrieved and
suspended in 100 lL of distilled water. After centrifugation for 1 min
at 13,000 rpm, the suspension was boiled for 10 min. The supernatant

was collected and used as the DNA template for PCR. The PCR condi-
tion was one cycle of pre-denaturation at 94 8C for 5 min, 35 cycles of
denaturation at 94 8C for 40 s, and elongation at 72 8C for 90 s, and
one cycle of post-elongation at 72 8C for 7 min. The annealing temper-
ature and the primers for the detection of the 11 antimicrobial resist-

ance genes are listed in Table 1.

3.5 | Conjugation experiments

The donors were eight Salmonella isolates with multiple resistance
gene (>6) cassettes. TET-resistant derivatives of E. coli DH5a were
used as receivers. Integron transfer was conﬁrmed in transconjugants

as described above. The primers used to conﬁrm the transfer of the

resistance genes are shown in Table 1.

4 | RE SULT S

4.1 | Isolation, identiﬁcation and serotyping of
Salmonella

A total of 285 samples were tested for Salmonella, and 16.8% (n 5 48)
of these samples were contaminated. The studied samples were
chicken (n 5 200) and pork (n 5 85). The results are shown in Table 2.

Most of the 48 Salmonella strains were isolated from chicken meat
(n 5 42). The incidence of Salmonella isolation was signiﬁcantly higher
in chicken than in pork. Among the 48 Salmonella isolates, ﬁve sero-

types were identiﬁed as follows: S. enteritidis (20.83%, 10/48), S. new-

Among the 48 isolates, 45 strains (93.75%) showed resistance to
the antimicrobial agents, and three strains demonstrated no resistance
to the four antibiotics. The frequency of resistance among isolates was
high. Of the 45 resistant Salmonella isolates, 23 strains were resistant
to one antibiotic and 10 were resistant to two antibiotics. Multiresist-
ance (resistance to at least three antimicrobials) was observed in this
study. The percentage of multiresistant strains among the antibiotic-
resistant isolates was 25%. Approximately 10.42% of the strains were
resistant to the four antibiotics (Table 4).

Seven strains were resistant to both GEN and TET, and only one

strain was resistant to both CEX and GEN. Only one isolate was found

to be resistant to both CEX and TET. Twelve strains demonstrated mul-

tiresistance. Five of them were resistant to CEX, GEN and TET,

whereas two were resistant to GEN, LVX and TET (Table 4).

Meanwhile, MDR was observed in S. typhimurium (n 5 4), S. typhi
(n 5 2), S. enteritidis (n 5 4) and S. newport (n 5 2) isolated from chicken
(Table 5). S. typhi and S. enteritidis from pork were only resistant to

TET. Approximately 12.5% (1/8 isolates) of S. newport isolates from

chicken were susceptible to all the tested antibiotics, and multiresist-

ance to CEX, LVX, GEN and TET was discovered in 25% of S. newport

isolates. All 15 isolates of S. typhi from chicken showed resistance, and

multiresistance (three antimicrobials) was found in only 13.3% (2/15

isolates). MDR to LVX, GEN and TET was found in 6.67% (1/15 of iso-

lates) of the S. typhi isolates and 12.5% (1/8 of isolates) of the S. typhi-

murium isolates. All the S. enteritidis isolates were resistant to TET. One

of the S. gallinarum isolates was resistant to GEN and TET, and the

others were susceptible to all the tested antimicrobials.

4.3 | Prevalence of resistance genes

Eight of the 11 resistance genes (tetA, qnrS, blaCTX-Mgroup1, blaCTX-M-2,
blaCTX-M group9, blaTEM, blaSHV and aac(6)-ib-cr) were found in resistant
Salmonella isolates by PCR. Two of the isolates did not carry any resist-
ance genes. The blaCTX-Mgroup8/25, qnrA and blaIMP genes were not
found in any of the Salmonella isolates (Table 6). Table 7 shows that

the tetA gene was the most common gene (91.67% of isolates; 44/48)

found in Salmonella from pork and chicken, followed by the aac(6)-ib-cr

(79.17%) and qnrS (75%) genes. More than two resistance genes were

detected in approximately 81.25% of the isolates (39/48).

Table 8 shows the resistance gene patterns found in diﬀerent

serovars isolated from pork and chicken. Thirty-one resistance gene

patterns were found in this study. The majority of the isolates showed

patterns containing more than two resistance genes. The distribution

of resistance genes diﬀered among various sources (Table 8). All kinds

of genes were found in S. typhimurium, S. typhi, S. enteritidis and S. new-

port from chicken. The gene patterns tetA and qnrS were the most

common gene pattern in S. typhi from chicken.

Table 9 shows the distribution of resistance genes relative to anti-
biotic resistance patterns. Three strains did not exhibit phenotypic
resistance; one isolate did not have a resistance gene, and the other
two isolates showed no phenotypic resistance but harbored resistance
genes. Moreover, one isolate had no resistance genes, but it was resist-
ant to TET. Notably, the phenotype with CEX resistance always carried
the b-lactamase genes blaCTX-M group1, blaCTX-M-2 and blaCTX-M group9,
either individually or concurrently.

4.4 | Conjugative transfer of resistance genes

Conjugation experiments were performed on eight Salmonella isolates,
which harbored more than seven resistance genes. Six of the eight
resistance genes (tetA, qnrS, aac(6)-ib-cr, blaTEM, blaSHV and blaCTX-M
group9) were successfully transferred into E. coli DH5a recipient cells.
The BlaCTX-M-2 and blaCTX-M group9 genes were not found in the trans-
conjugants. All eight isolates successfully transferred their resistance
genes into the recipient cells.

5 | DISCUSSION

Chicken and pork are the most common retail meat in Changchun,
because they are major ingredients in most local dishes. Thus, Salmo-
nella in pork and chicken are very easily transfected to human beings in
Changchun. The Salmonella search was positive in 16.8% of the 285
animal-based foods in this region. Approximately 87.5% of the positive
Salmonella samples (42/48) were from chicken, and 12.5% (6/48) were
from pork. A high Salmonella prevalence was observed by Abbassi-
Ghozzi et al. (2012), who reported 48.3% of Salmonella recovery from
60 chicken samples from outlet stores in the area of “Grand Tunis,”
Tunisia. In a study performed in Mexico, Zaidi et al. (2006) found high
Salmonella spp. prevalence in pork (58.1%) and poultry (39.7%).

In the present study, ﬁve and two serovars were recovered from
chicken and pork, respectively. S. typhi was the most common sero-
var in both chicken and pork. In a previous study, a total of 21, 8
and 3 diﬀerent serovars were recovered from chicken, turkey and
pork, respectively, and S. hadar was found to be the most common
in chicken (Aslam et al., 2012). Singh, Yadav, Singh, and Bharti
(2010) reported that 14 of 26 isolates were serotyped as S. typhimu-
rium, indicating a prevalence rate of 53.85%. The prevalence of Sal-
monella serovars from chicken may be distinguished by region
(Parveen et al., 2007).

In this study, resistance to TET was observed in 87.5% of all the
strains. This frequency was the highest of all the antimicrobials used in
this test. Resistance to CEX, GEN and LVX was observed in 25, 39.58
and 16.67%, respectively. The results indicated that TET resistance in
Salmonella was very common, and resistances to CEX and LVX were
low in Changchun, China. The isolates from pork were found to be
resistant only to TET. In Bacci et al. (2012)’s report, 86.1% of the Sal-
monella isolates showed resistance to TET, 80.5% demonstrated resist-
ance to sulfamethoxazole, and 33.3% were resistant to ampicillin;
moreover, GEN inhibited the growth of all the isolates. Wannaprasat,
Padungtod, and Chuanchuen (2011) reported that 89% of the isolates

are resistant to at least one antibiotic, with TET resistance (74%) being
the most common. Thus, the Salmonella isolates from meat were com-
monly resistant to TET, and TET resistance was the most common
form of antimicrobial resistance.

In this study, the resistance phenotype to GEN, TET, LVX and CEX
was clearly present, and isolates from pork were only resistant to TET.
Data in this study showed that retail chicken had a higher prevalence
of Salmonella serovars presenting resistance to antimicrobials used in

clinical treatment. This ﬁnding may be due to early large-scale breeding

of poultry and the use of antibiotics as chicken feed additives to pre-

ance of Salmonella isolates recovered from raw meat marketed in the

vent disease and promote growth.

The analysis of resistance genes in Salmonella was an important

aspect of this study. To further study the mechanism of antimicrobial
resistance in Salmonella, we ampliﬁed the strains’ resistance genes. The
results showed that tetA was the most common gene followed by aac

(6)-ib-cr. In some reports, the tetA gene was very common if the isolate

was resistant to TET (Hur, Kim, Park, Lee, & Lee, 2011). The
b-lactamase genes are very important, because the b-lactam antibiotic
utilization rate among patients has reached 70% in China. Antibiotic
resistance genes of b-lactam have lower resistance rates than other
antibiotic resistance genes of several antibiotics. BlaCTX -m group9 exhib-
ited the highest detection rate (62.5%), whereas blaCTX -m group1 had
the lowest detection rate (27.08%). This study is the ﬁrst report on the

presence of resistance genes in Salmonella isolated from chicken and

pork in Changchun. The presence of such genes is one of the main

causes of drug resistance. Resistance to TET, GEN, CEX and oﬂoxacin
is closely related to the tetA gene, aac(6)-ib-cr, qnrS and blaCTX–M,
respectively.

Notably, some isolates carry resistance genes but do not encode

the corresponding resistant phenotype. Thus, detecting the genes that

code for drug resistance will not necessarily result in a resistant pheno-

type. Some gene expression levels were relatively low and did not have

any eﬀect on treatment, or the resistant phenotypes encoded by the

detected drug-resistant genes did not match the antibiotics in our

experiments. Moreover, an inactivated enzyme or puriﬁed enzyme was

only one factor of resistance mechanisms. It was also closely related to

changes in the cell wall permeability active eﬄux mechanism and

changes in the drug target.

Plasmid transduction was performed on the isolates, and E. coli
DH5a was used as the receiver. The resistance genes of the strains
were detected by PCR. Six of the eight resistance genes (tetA, qnrS,
aac(6)-ib-cr, blaTEM, blaSHV and blaCTX-M group9) were successfully trans-
ferred into E. coli DH5a recipient cells. Resistance of Salmonella could
spread to other microorganisms by horizontal gene transfer. This ﬁnd-

ing was similar to the results reported by Thong & Modarressi (2011),

but the genes diﬀered.

In conclusion, this study demonstrated the role of food-producing

animals as an origin of MDR Salmonella and underscored the necessity

of continuing surveillance of food-borne zoonotic pathogens along the

food chain.
