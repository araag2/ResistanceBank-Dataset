Abstract

Background: Salmonella is one of the most important foodborne pathogens, causing outbreaks of human salmonellosis
worldwide. Owing to large scales of consumption markets, pork and poultry that contaminated by Salmonella could pose
a tremendous threat to public health. The aim of this study was to investigate the contamination of Salmonella from
chicken, pork and the environment in slaughtering and retail processes in Chongqing, China.
Results: A total of 115 Salmonella isolates were recovered from 1112 samples collected from pork, chicken and the
environment. Compared with the isolation rate of samples from chicken (9.50%) and the environment (6.23%), samples
from pork had a significant higher isolation rate (44.00%). The isolation rates in slaughterhouses (10.76%) and in
supermarkets (10.07%) showed no statistical difference. Thirty different serotypes were identified among all the isolates. S.
Derby (n = 26), S. London (n = 16) and S. Rissen (n = 12) were the dominant serotypes. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
revealed that 73.04% isolates were resistant to tetracycline, followed by 66.96% to ampicillin and 59.13% to doxycycline.
More than half (50.43%) of the isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR), and most of the MDR isolates were from
supermarkets. Multilocus sequence typing results showed 24 out of 115 isolates were ST40, which was the most
prevalent. Furthermore, isolates from supermarkets had 20 different sequence types while isolates from slaughterhouses
only had 8 different sequence types.
Conclusion: Our study highlighted that Salmonella was more frequently isolated in pork production chain than that in
chicken. Compared with isolates from slaughterhouses, isolates from supermarkets had more MDR profiles and
represented a wider range of serotypes and sequence types, indicating that the retail process had more diverse sources
of Salmonella contamination than that of slaughtering process.

Background
Salmonella, a foodborne pathogen, causes diarrhoeal dis-
eases even death in both humans and animals [1]; it can
survive in a dry environment for several weeks or even in
water for several months [2]. According to previous sur-
veys, the aetiological agent of salmonellosis largely attrib-
uted to contaminated food, which mostly were poultry
and pork [3, 4]. In China, pork is the mainstream of meat
consumption. Meanwhile, the consumption of poultry is
rising year by year. Contamination by Salmonella in
slaughtering and retail processes of chicken and pork
could be a potential pathway to threat public health.

Antibiotics are widely used to improve human and ani-
mal health, and also are commonly incorporated into ani-
mal feed to improve growth rate and feed efficiency in
many countries [5, 6] A previous report showed that China
approximately consumed more than 162,000 tons of antibi-
otics annually, and husbandry industry account for 52.00%
of the total consumption. Within the husbandry industry
consumed antibiotics, 52.20% antibiotics were in pork pro-
duction and 19.60% were in chicken production. As for the
categories of antibiotic, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, fluoro-
quinolones, macrolides, β-lactams, and other antibiotics
shared 5.00, 7.00, 17.00, 26.00, 21.00, and 24.00% of the
total usage [7]. Long-term exposed to antibiotics has led se-
lection pressure to environmental bacterium, which causes
antimicrobial resistance and even multidrug resistance
(MDR). Antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella is a global
issue. Large amount of Salmonellae resistant to extended-
spectrum-β-lactams (ESBLs) and fluoroquinolones, which
are important in treating salmonellosis [8]. Drug-resistant
Salmonella, especially multidrug-resistant Salmonella, has
been a menace to food safety and human health.

Typing methods

the
characterization of Salmonella can help to enrich our
knowledge of its regularity of dissemination. Serotyping
presents a well-established methodology for typing of
Salmonella [9]. To date, approximately 2600 serotypes
have been discovered. The traditional method for sero-
typing,
the Kauffmann-White-Le Minor Scheme re-
quires a series of antisera, consuming time and money.
Hence, a variety of typing methods were established to
study the molecular epidemiologic characterization of
Salmonella with its transmission dynamics,
including
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), restriction frag-
ment length polymorphism (RFLP), amplified fragment
length polymorphism (AFLP), whole-genome sequen-
cing (WGS), and multilocus sequence typing (MLST)
[10–13]. Compared with other methods, MLST is a
highly repeatable typing method that based on se-
quence analysis of selected housekeeping genes. Re-
cently, approximately 224,516 Salmonella strains has
been uploaded by users in the MLST database [14],
which becomes a convenient tool for researchers.

Contamination and antimicrobial resistance of Salmon-
ella isolated from food-producing animals is severe world-
wide [15], particularly in China [16–18]. Furthermore,
several studies reported that Salmonella isolates could be
recovered from farms, slaughterhouses and retail markets
[19, 20] and a previous study indicated that Salmonella
isolates could transmitted from slaughterhouses to retail
markets in pig production chain [17]. However, few stud-
ies focused on the comparison of Salmonella contamin-
ation inpork and chicken as well as their slaughtering and
retail chains. Therefore, the intention of this study was to
compare the antimicrobial resistance, and genetic rela-
tionship of Salmonella isolates recovered from the envir-
onment, chicken and pork at abattoirs and supermarkets
located in Chongqing, China.

Results
Isolation and serotyping of Salmonella from samples
A total of 115 Salmonella isolates were recovered from
1112 samples collected from slaughterhouses and super-
markets, the isolation rates form pork, chicken and the
environment were 44.00, 9.50 and 6.23%, respectively.
Samples from pork had significant higher isolation rates
than that from chicken and the environment in both
slaughterhouses and supermarkets (Table 1). Within the
different sources of environmental samples, Salmonellae
were isolated only from floor, knives and tables at
slaughterhouses, but isolated from all the sources of en-
vironmental samples at supermarkets, especially chop-
ping boards and ice (Table 2). These results indicated
that the environment in supermarkets had more diverse
contamination sources than that in slaughterhouses.

Thirty serotypes in 108 isolates were successfully identi-
fied, except that seven isolates were failed in serotyping. Sal-
monella Derby (n = 26), London (n = 16), and Rissen (n = 12)
were the most commonly observed serotypes in this study.
Isolates from slaughterhouses had 10 serotypes (Fig. 1a) and
supermarkets had 25 serotypes (Fig. 1b). Five serotypes
(Derby, Typhimurium, London, Rissen, and Jerusalem) were
shared both at supermarkets and slaughterhouses. Five sero-
types were only detected at slaughterhouses, while 20 sero-
types were only detected at supermarkets. Taken together,
isolates from supermarkets showed more diverse serotypes
than that from slaughterhouses.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 115 Salmonella
isolates to 13 antimicrobials was performed. Overall,
85.22% (98/115) isolates were resistant to at least one
antibiotic and 50.43% (58/115) were MDR. For samples
from both slaughterhouses and supermarkets,
isolates
showed resistance to tetracycline (73.04%, 84/115) was
the highest, followed by 66.96% (77/115) to ampicillin
and 59.13% (68/115) to doxycycline (Fig. 2a). The rates

MDR strains (Fig. 2e) were made up of 25.86% (15/58)
at slaughterhouses and 74.14% (43/58) at supermarkets.

Multilocus sequence typing
Multilocus sequence typing was used to identify the re-
latedness of Salmonella in pork, chicken and the envir-
onment
supermarkets.
Twenty-three different sequence types (STs) were identi-
fied among 108 isolates, while 7 isolates with failed sero-
typing results also defected in MLST were excluded for
further analysis (Fig. 3). All sequence types consist of 15

from slaughterhouses

and

from supermarkets, 3 (ST543, ST365 and ST516) from
slaughterhouses and 5 (ST19, ST34, ST40, ST155 and
ST469) from both sites. Most of the sequence types were
detected in less than 10 isolates, except for ST40, ST155
and ST469. The largest population of isolates were ST40
(n = 24), followed by ST155 (n = 19) and ST469 (n = 17).
Some Salmonella isolates presented similar sequence
types that belonged to the same serovar. For example, all
ST40 isolates were S. Derby, all S. Rissen isolates
belonged to a single cluster (ST469) and 15 out of 16 S.
London isolates were ST155. As for the relationship be-
tween MLST and antibiotic resistance, we found that
ST17 and ST155 were resistant to a wide range of

antibiotics in this study, especially that 16 out of 18
ST155 isolates were MDR strains (Fig. 3).

Discussion
For the purpose of this study, Salmonella isolates were
recovered from scores of sites, including chicken, pork
and the environment at abattoirs and supermarkets. Our
results indicated that Salmonella was more frequently
isolated in pork, and supermarkets exhibited a higher
MDR Salmonella isolation rate and more diversity in se-
rotypes and sequence types than slaughterhouses.

The overall isolation rate of Salmonella in our study was
10.25%, which was lower than previous studies conducted
in Sichuan province [11] and Yangzhou city [17], but close
to surveys in three provinces of central China [21] and
Germany [22]. It should be noted that although isolation
rate at slaughterhouses (10.76%) was similar to that at
supermarkets (10.07%), Salmonella appeared more fre-
quently in pork (44.00%) than that in chicken (9.50%).
Other studies also showed that Salmonella contamination
rates in pork varies from 30 to 70% at retail markets [23,
24] and from 10 to 50% at slaughterhouses [25, 26],

indicating that poor control measures were performed in
slaughtering and retail chains of pork. For example, poor
general hygiene and unsuitable storage conditions were
commonly detected in pig slaughterhouses. Also, lacking
of appropriate storage methods and regular disinfection
increased the risk of Salmonella-colonizing activity at re-
tail markets. In general, all of the differences attributed to
collection seasons, amounts of samples and types, isola-
tion methods and management.

S. Derby, generally detected in pork, could cause sal-
monellosis in many countries [27], and S. Rissen was
generally considered to be transported through pig prod-
ucts in European countries [28]. In this study, S. Derby
and S. Rissen were isolated from pork, chicken and the
environment, and most of S. Derby isolates were de-
tected in the environment. S. Derby was the dominant
serotype, which was similar to other studies [11, 17]. S.
Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis are the main serotypes
causing acute human infection [29], and in this study 11
isolates were detected to be S. Enteritidis or S. Typhi-
murium, which had potential threats to public health. In
addition, more categories of serotypes and sequence

types were detected in isolates from supermarkets than
that from slaughterhouses, demonstrating the various
and abundant sources of contamination in retail process.
Some STs in this study related to specific serovars, for
instance S. London with ST155, ST469 with S. Rissen,
and ST40 with S. Derby. Our results supported the con-
jecture that multilocus sequence typing could be an al-
ternative method for serotyping in the future [30].

In this study, most of the isolates showed resistance to
tetracycline and ampicillin, which was similar to a previ-
ous study [31]. The high resistance rate to these two an-
tibiotics is reasonable, since these two antibiotics has
been largely used in the husbandry industry in China
[7]. It was noteworthy that more than half of the isolates
exhibited MDR profiles, and compared with slaughter-
houses, MDR Salmonella contamination occurred at su-
permarkets was much more frequently. The sanitation
control strategies in supermarkets need to be carried out
in this area to improve the safety of animal products.

Conclusion
In summary, the results of this study indicated that the
contamination of Salmonella occurred in pork made it
become a potential reservoir for human infection to
some extent. In addition, although the isolation rate at
supermarkets was close to that at slaughterhouses, iso-
lates from supermarkets presented a high frequency of

MDR profiles and a wider range of serotypes and sequence
types; these results indicated that Salmonella isolates from
supermarkets were more threatening and their sources were
much more complicated than that from slaughterhouses.
Therefore, strict hygiene method and HACCP management
in retail process should be taken into consideration to pre-
vent foodborne infection caused by Salmonella.

Methods
Sample collection
Convenience sampling was carried out in 7 slaughterhouses
and 5 supermarkets in 12 districts of Chongqing, China.
From March to October in 2015, a total of 1112 samples
were isolated. Chicken and pork were unpacked fresh meat;
slaughtering environment including wash water (n = 30),
knives (n = 30), floor (n = 30), feces (n = 15), apparatus (n =
30), containers (n = 30), tables (n = 30), carcasses (n = 30),
and blood (n = 20); retail environment including chopping
boards (n = 75), ice (n = 75), knives (n = 75), floor (n = 75),
containers (n = 75), wash water (n = 75), and tables (n = 75).
All collected samples were stored in an icebox and trans-
ported to a laboratory within 2 h of collection for immedi-
ate processing and then held in a refrigerator at 4 °C.

Isolation and serotyping
After a pre-enrichment step of each sample in 10 mL

overnight at 37 °C. 0.2 mL of each pre-enriched suspen-
sions were added into 2 ml of Rappaport-Vassiliadis en-
richment Broth (RVB) and 2 ml of Tetrathionate broth
(TTB) respectively, then incubated at 42 °C for 24 h. One
loopful of each RVB and TTB culture was then streaked
onto Xylose Lysine Tergitol 4 (XLT-4) agar plates, which
were incubated at 37 °C for 24 to 48 h. Among suspected
colonies, only one was picked up from a plate and con-
firmed by specific gene through Polymerase Chain Reac-
tion (PCR) of Salmonella using assays. Each isolate was

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
The standard Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method recom-
mended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Insti-
tute (CLSI, 2010) was carried out to test antimicrobial
susceptibility of the Salmonella isolates to 13 categories
of antimicrobials (Hangzhou Microbial Reagent., Ltd.):
ampicillin (AMP 10 μg), cefoperazone (CFP 75 μg), pi-
peracillin (PRL 100 μg), tetracycline (TE 30 μg), ceftazi-
dime (CAZ 30 μg), doxycycline (DOX 30 μg), ceftriaxone
(CRO 30 μg), minocycline (MH 30 μg), norfloxacin
(NOR 10 μg), sulfamethoxazole (SXT 1.25 μg), ofloxacin
(OFX 5 μg), chloramphenicol (C 30 μg) and ciprofloxacin
(CIP 5 μg). Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was invoked as
the control organism. According to the CLSI, the iso-
lates were considered to be susceptible, intermediate, or
resistant. Salmonella isolates resistant to three or more
antimicrobial classes were defined as MDR isolates.

Multilocus sequence typing
Protocols used for MLST of Salmonella were described
online [33]. Seven housekeeping genes were amplified by
PCR, including thrA, purE, sucA, hisD, aroC, hemD, and
dnaN. PCR products were purified and sequenced by
Sanger method, and the alleles and STs were assigned
according to the MLST scheme [34]. The unweighted
pair group method with arithmetic means analysis
(UPGMA) was utilized to infer relationships among the
isolates through MEGA7 software [35].

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were done using SPSS 20.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL), and the chi-squared test was applied
to assess any statistically significant (P < 0.05) differences
in this study.
