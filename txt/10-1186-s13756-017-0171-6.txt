Abstract

Background: Beta-lactam and quinolone antimicrobials are commonly used for treatment of infections caused by
non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) and other pathogens. Resistance to these classes of antimicrobials has increased
significantly in the recent years. However, little is known on the genetic basis of resistance to these drugs in
Salmonella isolates from Ethiopia.
Methods: Salmonella isolates with reduced susceptibility to beta-lactams (n = 43) were tested for genes encoding
for beta-lactamase enzymes, and those resistant to quinolones (n = 29) for mutations in the quinolone resistance
determining region (QRDR) as well as plasmid mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes using PCR and sequencing.
Results: Beta-lactamase genes (bla) were detected in 34 (79.1%) of the isolates. The dominant bla gene was blaTEM,
recovered from 33 (76.7%) of the isolates, majority being TEM-1 (24, 72.7%) followed by TEM-57, (10, 30.3%).
The blaOXA-10 and blaCTX-M-15 were detected only in a single S. Concord human isolate. Double substitutions
in gyrA (Ser83-Phe + Asp87-Gly) as well as parC (Thr57-Ser + Ser80-Ile) subunits of the quinolone resistance determining
region (QRDR) were detected in all S. Kentucky isolates with high level resistance to both nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin.
Single amino acid substitutions, Ser83-Phe (n = 4) and Ser83-Tyr (n = 1) were also detected in the gyrA gene. An isolate of
S. Miami susceptible to nalidixic acid but intermediately resistant to ciprofloxacin had Thr57-Ser and an additional novel
mutation (Tyr83-Phe) in the parC gene. Plasmid mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes investigated were not
detected in any of the isolates. In some isolates with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and/or nalidixic acid,
no mutations in QRDR or PMQR genes were detected. Over half of the quinolone resistant isolates in the current
study 17 (58.6%) were also resistant to at least one of the beta-lactam antimicrobials.
Conclusion: Acquisition of blaTEM was the principal beta-lactamase resistance mechanism and mutations within QRDR
of gyrA and parC were the primary mechanism for resistance to quinolones. Further study on extended spectrum
beta-lactamase and quinolone resistance mechanisms in other gram negative pathogens is recommended.

Background
Salmonellosis in humans is caused by several serovars
belonging to Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica. In-
fection by Salmonella causes two forms of diseases;
typhoid fever, a febrile illness caused by a few host spe-
cific serovars such as Salmonella enterica subspecies
enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi,) and S. Paratyphi A,
while the majority of Salmonella serovars cause non-
typhoidal salmonellosis characterized by self
limiting
gastoentritis and occasional
invasive salmonellosis in
immunocompromised, young and elderly patients. Infec-
tion with non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) serovars is
one of the leading causes of foodborne illnesses world-
wide [1]. NTS infection is commonly associated with
consumption of contaminated food of animal origin
such as poultry products, beef and pork as well as con-
tact with infected animals [2–4].

Antimicrobial treatment is usually not recommended
due to the self-limiting nature of the disease. However,
in cases of invasive complicated salmonellosis, treatment
with beta-lactam antimicrobials such as ampicillin, cef-
triaxone and quinolone drugs are employed as lifesaving
agents [5]. Resistance to beta-lactam antimicrobials and
quinolones has increased dramatically in NTS isolates
from humans as well as food animals worldwide [6–9].
The common mechanism of resistance to beta-lactam
antimicrobials is due to production of beta-lactamase
enzymes with variable level of activity against different
generations of beta-lactam antimicrobials. In addition to
the first generation beta-lactamases: blaTEM1, blaSHV1,
several extended spectrum blaTEM and blaSHV variants,
other extended spectrum beta-lactamase enzymes such as
blaCTX-M, blaCMY, blaOXA and AmpC have been re-
ported in Salmonella serotypes from different parts of the
world [10–13].

Resistance to quinolone drugs is primarily mediated by
mutations in Quinolone Resistance Determining Region
(QRDR) of gyrA and parC genes in Salmonella and
other Gram-negative organisms. Specifically, high level
resistance to ciprofloxacin is frequently attributed to
double mutations in the gyrA gene and single or double
mutation in the parC gene [14]. In addition to chromo-
somal mutations, other mechanisms such as activation
of efflux pumps (multidrug efflux pump and quinolone
specific plasmid mediated efflux pump encoded by qep
genes), qnr (plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance),
porins, and quinolone-modifying enzyme (aac(6')-Ib-cr)
have been associated with decreased susceptibility to
quinolones [14]. Of particular concern is the occurrence,
within the last few years in different parts of the world,
of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance encoded by
several qnr genes. These genes encode for pentapeptide
proteins that protect bacterial topoisomerases from the
effect of quinolones. They do not induce high level

resistance but their presence leads to mutation in the
QRDR [15]. However, recent report from Senegal indi-
cated the presence of qnrB1 together with the quinolone
modifying enzyme aac(6’)-Ib-cr in Salmonella associated
with high level resistance to ciprofloxacin even in the
absence of mutations in the QRDR [16]. These resist-
ance determinants have been observed in various gram
negative organisms including Salmonella [16, 17]. In
recent years, the rate of resistance to ciprofloxacin has
increased considerably in both clinical and food isolates
of Salmonella [6, 18, 19].

In Ethiopia, reports revealed resistance to beta-lactam
antimicrobials and quinolones in Salmonella isolates
from human patients and food of animal origin [20, 21].
However, little data is available on the genetic basis of
the observed phenotypic drug resistance. Multidrug re-
sistant S. Concord isolates obtained from children
adopted from Ethiopia in different European countries
and USA were reported to harbor blaCTX-M-15,
blaTEM1, blaSHV-12 genes encoding for resistance to
third generation cephalosporins, qnrA and qnrB encoding for
reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones [22, 23]. The
aim of this study was to investigate the genetic markers
associated with resistance to beta-lactam and quinolone
antimicrobials
collected from
among NTS isolates
humans and animals in central Ethiopia.

Methods
Bacterial isolates
Non-typhoidal Salmonella strains investigated in the
current study were isolated from feces of food animals
(cattle n = 50, poultry n = 26, swine n = 8)
in Addis
Ababa and surrounding districts of Oromia region
namely: Ada, Barake, Sebeta and Sululta. In addition,
Salmonella isolates obtained from stool of temporally
and spatially related diarrheic human patients from primary
health centers and Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital in
Addis Ababa (n = 68) were also included. All human and
animal isolates were collected from 2013 to 2014.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, serotyping and
phage typing
Susceptibility of each isolate to beta-lactam and quinolone
antimicrobials was determined using disk diffusion method
according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI). The interpretation of the cate-
gories of susceptible, intermediate or resistant was also
based on the CLSI guidelines [24]. For purposes of analysis,
all readings classified as intermediate were considered re-
sistant unless otherwise mentioned. Escherichia coli ATCC
25922 was used as a quality control. Salmonella isolates
were serotyped and phage-typed at the Public Health
Agency of Canada, World Organization for Animal Health

(OIÉ), Reference Laboratory for Salmonellosis, Guelph,
Ontario, Canada as described previously [25].

Bacterial DNA extraction
Isolates were grown on Luria Bertani (LB) agar (37 °C,
over night). A single colony was inoculated to 5 ml of
LB broth and grown in a shaking incubator at 37 °C for
16–18 h. Genomic DNA was then extracted using the
QIAGEN genomic DNA extraction kit (QIAGEN, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s recommendation.

Detection and characterization of beta-lactamase
enzymes
A total of 43 isolates, 12 from humans and 31 from ani-
mals, with reduced susceptibility to one or more of
beta-lactam antimicrobials
(ampicillin, amoxicillin +
clavulanic acid, cephalothin, ceftriaxone) were tested
for genes encoding for beta-lactamase enzymes. PCR

and DNA sequencing were performed for the detec-
tion and characterization of beta-lactamase (bla) genes
with oligonucleotide primers previously described for
blaTEM, blaSHV, blaPER, blaPSE, blaOXA1, blaOXA4,
blaOXA10, blaCMY, and blaCTX-M genes (Table 1). The
PCR conditions for all reactions involved an initial de-
naturation for 3 min at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles of
(95 °C for 30 s, specific annealing temperature for 1 min,
and extension at 72 °C for 30 s) followed by a final exten-
sion at 72 °C for 5 min. Specific annealing temperature for
each PCR reaction is shown in Table 1. Group specific
primers were used to characterize blaCTX-M enzymes
[26]. The PCR amplicons were purified using QIAGEN
PCR purification kit (QIAGEN, USA) and sequenced
with forward and reverse primers at Sequencing, Geno-
typing, Oligosynthesis and Proteomics (Segolip) unit of
Biosciences eastern and central Africa (BecA). All
amplicon sequences were assembled and translated to

(Inqaba Biotechnical Industries, (Pty) Ltd, Denmark)
and compared with protein sequences in the Genbank
database. Classification of blaTEM enzymes was based
on beta-lactamase classification database (https://www.
lahey.org/studies/temtable.asp).

Investigation of quinolone resistance mechanism
Isolates with reduced susceptibility to nalidixic acid and/
or ciprofloxacin (n = 29), three human isolates and 26
animal
isolates were examined for the presence of
known quinolone resistance determinants. Quinolone
resistance determining region (QRDR): gyrA, gyrB, parC
and parE genes were amplified using PCR. PCR was also
used to examine for various plasmid mediated quinolone
resistance genes: qnrA, qnrB, qnrD, qnrS, qepA, and
aac(6′)-Ib-cr as described previously (Table 2). Similar
PCR conditions described previously were used and
annealing temperature for each primer set
is pre-
sented in Table 2. PCR ampilicons were purified using
QIAGEN PCR purification kit and sequenced as pre-
viously described. Presence of mutation in the QRDR
was examined by translating nucleotide sequences
into proteins and aligning against reference sequence

of S. Typhimurium strain LT2 on NCBI database
(Accession Number AE006468).

Results
Resistance to beta-lactam antimicrobials and
beta-lactamase genes in Salmonella isolates from
animals and humans
Of the 20 different serotypes investigated in the current
study, resistance to at least one beta-lactam antimicro-
bial was detected in nine serotypes and the bla gene
was detected only in isolates belonging to six serotypes.
Of the 43 isolates resistant to one or more beta-lactam
antimicrobials (ampicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid,
cephalothin, ceftriaxone), bla genes were detected in
34/43 (79.1%) of the isolates. The dominant bla gene
responsible for resistance to beta-lactam antimicrobials
in the majority of Salmonella isolates, 33 (76.7%) was
found to be variants of blaTEM gene. Most of these
were TEM-1 type, 24 (72.7%) followed by TEM-57, 10
(30.3%). Both phenotypic resistance to beta-lactam anti-
microbials and detection of bla genes was more com-
mon in isolates obtained from poultry compared to
isolates from other sources (Table 3). In one of the hu-
man isolates of S. Concord, two bla genes (blaOXA-10
and blaCTX-M-15) were detected. Both of these genes

encode for enzymes capable of extended spectrum
beta-lactamase activity. This isolate was resistant to the
third generation cephalosporin, ceftriaxone in addition
to ampicillin, and cephalothin. In eight (18.6%) of the
isolates, none of the tested bla genes were detected
(Table 3).

Among the dominant serotypes, 66.7, 92.3, 50 and
100% of S. Typhimurium, S. Saintpaul, S. Virchow and S.
Kentucky were positive for variants of the blaTEM gene,
respectively. All of the 10 S. Kentucky isolates collected
from cattle, poultry and humans were resistant to ampi-
cillin, cephalothin and amoxicillin + clauvlanic acid and
were all positive for blaTEM-1 gene (Table 4).

Interestingly, all 10 blaTEM-57 were recovered from S.
Saintpaul isolated from poultry, while those S. Saintpaul
strains obtained from cattle and human were all TEM-1
type. Despite a change in amino-acid sequences, there was
no distinct difference in phenotypic antimicrobial suscepti-
bility pattern to beta-lactam antimicrobials among isolates
carrying blaTEM-57 and blaTEM-1 enzymes.

Among eight isolates in which none of the tested bla
genes were detected, most of them were susceptible to
the major beta-lactams and were at the margin of sus-
ceptibility and intermediate; S. Dublin (n = 2) and S.
Typhimurium (n = 2) only to cephalothin and S. Haifa to
ampicillin (n = 1) On the other hand, three S. Virchow
isolates and one S. V:ROUGH-O;-:- were completely
resistant to ampicillin and cephalothin.

Mechanism of resistance to quinolone antimicrobials
Out of the 29 Salmonella isolates with reduced sensitivity
to quinolones, high level resistance to both nalidixic acid
and ciprofloxacin was observed in only 10 S. Kentucky iso-
lates (34.5%) (Table 5). All of these S. Kentucky isolates
had double mutations in gyrA (Ser83-Phe + Asp87-Gly)
and parC (Thr57-Ser + Ser80-Ile) genes. Single muta-
tion in gyrA (Ser83-Phe) was observed in four isolates
(S. Livingstone var.14+ (2), S. Virchow (1), S. I:6;7,14:-:I,w
(1). All these isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid and
intermediately resistant to ciprofloxacin. A single amino
acid substitution in gyrA (Ser83-Tyr) was detected in

one S. Haifa from poultry with an R-phenotype [resistant to
nalidixic acid and intermediately resistant to ciprofloxacin].
Overall, double and single substitutions in gyrA were de-
tected in 15 (51.7%) of the isolates. Double substitution in
parC (Thr57-Ser + Tyr83-Phe) was detected in one S.
Miami isolated from swine. This strain was sensitive to nali-
dixic acid and intermediately resistant to ciprofloxacin. The
Tyr83-Phe is a novel mutation. A strain of S. Agona
with only single substitution at Thr57-Ser was inter-
mediately resistant to nalidixic acid but sensitive to cip-
rofloxacin. Double substitution in the gyrB gene
(Val423-Gly + Asp459-His) was detected in two isolates;
S. Mikawasima and S. Braenderup, the latter having
additional substitution in parC gene (Thr57-Ser) asso-
ciated with intermediate susceptibility to both nalidixic
acid and ciprofloxacin, whereas the former with inter-
mediate susceptibility only to naldixic acid. A strain of
serotype V: rough-O;-:- that was susceptible to nalidixic
acid but intermediately resistant to ciprofloxacin had
single substitution of Ser463-Ala on gyrB gene. Over
half of the quinolone resistant isolates in the current study
17 (58.6%) were also resistant to at least one of the beta-
lactam antimicrobials (Table 5) and all S. Kentucky iso-
lates resistant to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin were also
shown to be MDR to several antimicrobials in our pre-
vious works [27, 28]. No mutation was detected in parE
gene in any of the isolates examined in the current
study. Nine isolates with reduced sensitivity to nalidixic
acid and or ciprofloxacin had no mutation in any of the
QRDR (Table 5).

Plasmid mediated quinolone resistance
None of the tested plasmid mediated quinolone resist-
ance genes were detected in the isolates examined in the
current study. Seven isolates belonging to serotypes
Saintpaul, Typhimurium, Aberdeen, Virchow and Haifa
were susceptible to nalidixic acid but had shown reduced
sensitivity to ciprofloxacin according to CLSI (2013) cut-
off points, with zone of inhibition ranging from 25 to
28 mm. There appears to be other resistance mecha-
nisms responsible for the observed decreased sensitivity.

Discussion
Detection of a high resistance rate to beta-lactam anti-
microbials (50%) and the presence of bla genes in iso-
lates from poultry could be due to the fact that drugs
like ampicillin and amoxicillin are frequently employed

in poultry farms in Ethiopia leading to selection pres-
sure. The dominant beta-lactamase genes detected in
the current study were variants of blaTEM with the
majority being blaTEM-1, which is concordant with the
observed spectrum of resistance to only ampicillin and

first generation cephalosporin in most of the isolates. In
Africa, blaTEM-1 has been reported from Salmonella
isolated from poultry in Egypt [29], from children adopted
from Mali [30], and S. Enteritidies in Senegal [31].

All S. Saintpaul isolated from poultry in the current
study carried blaTEM-57, while those from cattle and
human carried blaTEM-1. This is probably due to muta-
tion of a blaTEM gene in a strain of S. Saintpaul in one
of the poultry farms and clonal spread of strain carrying
this mutant gene to farms in the area. All poultry S.
Saintpaul were isolated from farms in the Adaa district.
Compared to TEM-1, TEM-57 has a substitution of Gly
to Asp at position 92 of amino acid sequence, which was

first reported from Proteus mirabilis [32] and later on
from E. coli in China [33]. To our knowledge, this is the
first report of detection of blaTEM-57 in Salmonella.
Fortunately, this mutation was not associated with ex-
tended spectrum activity against second and third gener-
ation cephalosporins.

One of the human isolates, S. Concord, resistant to
ampicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin and ceftriaxone was
shown to produce blaCTX-M-15 and blaOXA-10. Previous
studies have also reported blaCTX-M-15 in S. Concord iso-
lated from children adopted from Ethiopia to different
European countries and USA [34, 35]. In fact, a separ-
ate study also showed that blaCTX-M-15 isolated from

Eguale et al. Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control  (2017) 6:13 

Page 8 of 10

S. Concord from Ethiopia was chromosomally encoded
[35]. Nevertheless, the previous studies also showed
production of blaSHV-12 in most of the S. Concord
from Ethiopia, but OXA-10 was not reported. This is
presumably due to loss of a plasmid encoding for SHV-
12 and acquisition of OXA-10 in a new isolate from
Ethiopia. During the last few years, CTX-M-15 and other
related CTX-M enzymes have been widely reported from
various Enterobacteriaceae including Salmonella in
different African countries from both hospital and
community settings [16, 36–39]. Oxacilinases including
OXA-10 have also been commonly isolated from different
enterobacteriaceae including Salmonella [40].

The possible reason for the absence of bla genes in a
few isolates with reduced susceptibility in the current
study despite testing for most of the known bla reported in
Salmonella could be due to poor sensitivity of phenotypic
resistance detection methods. In two S. Typhimurium and
two S. Dublin intermediately resistant only to cephalothin
and one S. Haifa intermediately resistant to ampicillin, the
reading was at the margin of intermediate and susceptible.
However, all the three S. Virchow were fully resistant to
ampicillin and cephalothin and intermediately resistant to
amoxicillin + clauvlanic acid. For these isolates, other re-
sistance mechanisms not investigated in this study such as
alterations in the beta-lactam targets (PBPs) [41], absence
or down-regulation of the production of outer membrane
porins [42], over expression of efflux pumps [43] and dif-
ferent ampC betalactamases [44] might be responsible for
the observed reduction in susceptibility. In general, the rate
of occurrence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases in
Salmonella isolates in the current study is low. This could
be due to the fact that most of the human isolates were ob-
tained from primary health care centers and use of 2nd
and 3rd generation cephalosporins is not a common prac-
tice in veterinary medicine [28, 45]. The single MDR S.
Concord in the current study was isolated from hospi-
talized 1 year old child.

Amino acid substitutions at codon 83 and 87 of gyrA
gene have been associated with high level fluoroquino-
lone resistance [46–49] whereas resistance to only nali-
dixic acid is associated with single or double mutation in
parC gene in Salmonella and other Gram-negative path-
ogens [14, 50]. Detection of two amino acid substitu-
tions in the gyrA gene at codon 83 and 87 and the parC
gene at codon 57 and 80 in all S. Kentucky isolates with
high level resistance to both nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin
obtained from humans and animals suggests the possibility
of clonal spread of S. Kentucky strain in the human and
animal population in the study area. Similar mutations in
gyrA and parC genes were reported from S. Kentucky from
French travelers returning from north east and eastern
Africa [51]. Studies of S. Kentucky ST198 from different
countries have also shown a similar substitution in gyrA at

codon 83 (Ser83-Phe) for all isolates and substitution of
aspartate at codon 87 with asparagine, tyrosine or glycine
residues. S. Kentucky isolates in the current study also
belonged to ST198 suggesting the clonal relatedness of our
isolates to the internationally spreading clone of S. Ken-
tucky (unpublished data). However, only single substitution
in the parC gene at codon 80 (Ser80-Ile) was reported pre-
viously and none of them had substitution at codon 57 of
parC gene [52]. Additional substitution at codon 57 of the
parC gene in the Ethiopian isolates might have occurred
separately. Contrary to these local and global spread of
MDR fluoroquinolone resistant S. Kentucky, a previous
study on S. Typhimurium showed that mutation based
fluoroquinolone resistance is associated with fitness cost
and resistant strains are less invasive [53]. This suggests
that this internationally dispersed clone of S. Kentucky has
unique mechanisms. Furthermore, we have previously
shown that S. Kentucky strains from Ethiopia has strong
biofilm forming ability which is one of the important traits
for persistence of the organism in the host or the environ-
ment [54] that might have contributed to its dissemination.
Four of the Salmonella isolates resistant to nalidixic
acid and intermediately resistant to ciprofloxacin had
only a single substitution in the gyrA, Ser83-Phe,
whereas one isolate S. Haifa from poultry had a Ser83-
Tyr substitution. Previous studies have also shown that a
single mutation in gyrA results only in resistance to nali-
dixic acid and not to ciprofloxacin [47, 53]. Although
isolates with a single mutation in parC gene resulted
only with reduced susceptibility to nalidixic acid, an S.
Miami isolate with no mutation in gyrA gene but double
substitution in parC gene: (Thr57-Ser) and a novel sub-
stitution (Tyr83-Phe) was fully susceptible to nalidixic
acid and intermediately resistant to ciprofloxacin. This
suggests that the novel mutation at codon 83 of parC
gene might accentuate the activity of nalidixic acid and
attenuate the activity of ciprofloxacin.

The observation of double substitution in gyrB gene
(Val423-Gly + Asp459-His) associated with intermediate
susceptibility only to nalidixic acid shows a minor contribu-
tion of mutation in gyrB compared to gyrA for develop-
ment of resistance to quinolones. Interestingly, nine isolates
with reduced sensitivity to ciprofloxacin and some to
nalidixic acid had no mutation in QRDR. We have also not
detected PMQR genes in any of the isolates. Other resist-
ance mechanisms not tested in this study such as multidrug
efflux pumps, other PMQR mechanisms recently described
in Salmonella such as oqxAB efflux pump [19], and altered
outer membrane porins might be involved [14].

Conclusion
Co-occurrence of beta-lactamases with ciprofloxacin re-
sistant determinants in large proportion of isolates is a
major threat. Occurrence of MDR S. Kentucky with high

level fluoroquinolone resistance mediated by double mu-
tations in gyrA and parC genes in cattle, poultry, and
human in the study area suggests clonal spread of this
strain and the need for strict pathogen control strategies
to hamper further spread of this pathogen. As the majority
of the isolates in this study were from healthy animals at
the farm level and human patients from primary health
care centers, the data presented here may not represent
the national status. Further studies on extended spectrum
beta-lactamase and fluoroquinolone resistance mecha-
nisms in Salmonella and other gram negative pathogens
in hospital and community settings is recommended.
