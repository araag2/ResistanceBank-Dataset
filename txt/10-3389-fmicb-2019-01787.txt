High prevalence rates of sulfonamide resistance genes sul1, sul2, and sul3 have
been observed in Gram-negative bacteria isolated from humans, domestic animals,
and aquaculture species worldwide. We investigated the distribution characteristics,
location, conjugative transferability, and genetic environments of sul genes from
Escherichia coli isolates collected from Penaeus vannamei and pork samples from three
large markets in Zhejiang, China. The prevalence rates of sul genes in sulfonamide-
resistant E. coli
isolates from P. vannamei and pork samples were 90.0 and 88.6%,
respectively, and the prevalence of sul1 and sul2 was signiﬁcantly higher than that of
isolates were analyzed
sul3 (p < 0.05). Twenty-four representative sul-positive E. coli
in detail. Southern blot hybridization conﬁrmed that sul genes of E. coli
isolates were
located on plasmids and/or chromosomes. Transfer of resistance through conjugation
was observed in all 18 E. coli
isolates harboring sul genes on plasmids. Replicon
typing identiﬁed seven different incompatibility groups and IncF was the dominant
replicon type among sul gene-containing plasmids from both sources. PCR walking
analysis indicated that 87.5% (35/40) of sul gene-related fragments carried insertion
sequences (ISs) belonging to a variety of families in diverse sites, with IS26 occurring
most frequently. In addition, the sul1 gene was detected mainly in fragments carrying
class 1 integrons. Co-location on the same fragment with resistance genes that may
contribute to the persistence and dissemination of sul1 and/or sul2 genes. The diversity
of mobile genetic elements and resistance genes adjacent to sul3 was much lower
than those adjacent to sul1 and sul2, especially those located in chromosomes, which
reduced the transmission potential of the sul3 gene. In conclusion, combined with the
results of clonal relatedness analysis by PFGE and MLST of 24 representative E. coli
isolates from P. vannamei and pork samples, it showed that a small number of sul genes

Our results provide important information to better understand the risk of transmission
of sul genes from seafood and meat to humans.

INTRODUCTION

Aﬀairs of
the People’s Republic of China, March 2019)2.
Moreover, sulfonamides are among the most commonly used
antibiotics at swine farms, second only to tetracyclines (Hsu
et al., 2014), and are widely used in P. vannamei culture for
the prevention and treatment of common bacterial diseases
(Gao et al., 2012). Excessive usage of sulfonamides in the
shrimp farming and pig breeding industries in China imposes
widespread selective pressures on bacteria,
leading to the
enrichment of sulfonamide resistant strains in shrimp and
pork products that are capable of spreading between diﬀerent
environments (Liu et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2019). In our study,
P. vannamei and pork were chosen to study the prevalence
of sulfonamide resistance in three large markets in Zhejiang,
China to assess (i) whether diﬀerences occur in the distribution
of sul genes in Escherichia coli isolates from samples of two
diﬀerent host species collected from markets, (ii) whether vertical
transmission of sulfonamide resistant E. coli
or horizontal
occurs between P. vannamei and pork in market environments,
despite the diﬀerent growth conditions of the two animals
and (iii) whether regional spreading of sulfonamide resistant
E. coli in the same or diﬀerent host species occurs between
diﬀerent markets.

Escherichia coli are ubiquitous commensal bacteria, and
certain strains are zoonotic pathogens (Zhang et al., 2013).
E. coli are also considered eﬀective model organisms for studying
the essential processes of life due to their fast growth rate,
minimal nutritional requirements, comprehensively understood
biological processes, and extensively characterized genetics
(Jiang et al., 2016; Paraoan et al., 2017). More importantly,
E. coli are often used to monitor antimicrobial resistance,
as they have a wide range of hosts and can easily acquire
resistance genes via horizontal gene transfer (Fang et al., 2019).
Many nutritious aquatic and meat products are considered
reservoirs of E. coli as well as some antimicrobial resistance
genes (Alvarez-Fernandez et al., 2013; Skoˇcková et al., 2015;
Boss et al., 2016).

Here we investigated sul genes in E. coli isolates collected
from P. vannamei and pork samples
from three large
markets in Zhejiang Province, China. The clonal relatedness
among the representative sul-positive E. coli
isolates was
analyzed by pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis
(PFGE) and
multilocus sequence typing (MLST). In addition, the location,
genetic
transferability of
sul genes were further researched to assess the potential
transmission ability of sul genes in E. coli from two diﬀerent
animal host species.

Sulfonamides, which are fully synthetic antibiotics, have
been widely used to treat bacterial and protozoan infections
in humans, domestic
species
(Blahna et al., 2006; Peixoto et al., 2016). Although the
use of sulfonamides in human medicine has decreased in
developed countries, they are still frequently used in developing
Asian countries owing to their low price and availability
(Changkaew et al., 2014). In veterinary medicine, sulfonamides
are considered “high priority” due to high usage and their high
potential to enter the environment (Heuer and Smalla, 2007;
Wang et al., 2014).

alternative dihydropteroate

In the past decade, high prevalence rates of sulfonamide
resistance have been observed in mainly Gram-negative
bacteria isolated from animals and humans all over the
world (Wu et al., 2010; Card et al., 2016; Ben et al., 2017).
Resistance to sulfonamides occurs principally through the
acquisition of
synthase
(DHPS) gene sul, the product of which has a low aﬃnity
for sulfonamides (Changkaew et al., 2014). Unlike resistance
genes to other classes of antimicrobials such as tetracycline,
which are encoded by many diﬀerent genes, only three
known sulfonamide resistance (sul) genes (sul1, sul2, and
sul3) have been identiﬁed (Wu et al., 2010; Ben et al., 2017).
Based on alignments using MegAlign software, the nucleotide
sequences of sul1, sul2, and sul3 are approximately 50% similar
(Hsu et al., 2014).

Horizontal or vertical transfer of mobile genetic elements
(MGEs) that harbor resistance genes is considered the main
mechanism of dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes
(Rehman et al., 2017). sul genes have been identiﬁed on both
chromosomes and plasmids and are often associated with MGEs
such as transposons, integrons and insertion sequences (ISs) (Wu
et al., 2010). MGEs enable translocation of sul genes between
chromosomes and plasmids. In addition, plasmids carrying sul
genes can spread among bacteria of the same or diﬀerent
species or genera by conjugation or transformation, thereby
disseminating sul genes.

Penaeus vannamei, also known as Paciﬁc whiteleg shrimp,
are among the most popular culturable penaeid shrimp in
China, and China has been the world’s largest producer
of P. vannamei since 2001 (Global Aquaculture Production
1950−2016, FAO)1. Similarly,
in China, pork accounts for
approximately 64% of all meat production and is consistently
the most consumed meat (Ministry of Agriculture and Rural

Dissemination of E. coli sul Genes

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Shrimp and Pork Sampling and E. coli
Isolation
A total of 180 P. vannamei and 180 pork samples were collected
from three diﬀerent open markets (n = 60 per market) in Zhejiang
Province, China between June 2017 and June 2018 (Table 1).
Samples were collected from each market every 4 months (June
2017, October 2017, February 2018, and June 2018). A total of
90 samples were collected from the three markets at each visit,
including 15 P. vannamei and 15 pork samples from each market.
The methods for sample treatment and E. coli isolation and
identiﬁcation are described in detail in our previously published
studies (Cheng et al., 2019; Fang et al., 2019). Following the
previous protocol, one E. coli isolate was obtained from each
sample (Changkaew et al., 2014; Boss et al., 2016; Cheng et al.,
2019; Fang et al., 2019). Colonies were stored at −80◦C until
further examination.

Phenotypic Screening for Sulfonamide
Resistance
All conﬁrmed E. coli isolates collected from P. vannamei and
pork samples were assessed for susceptibility to sulﬁsoxazole
using the disk diﬀusion method on Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar
(Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, United Kingdom) in accordance with
the guidelines of the (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
[CLSI], 2017). According to CLSI guidelines, sulﬁsoxazole can
be used to test all known types of sulfonamide resistance.
Sulﬁsoxazole (300 µg) antibiotic disks were obtained from
Hangzhou Microbial Reagent Co., Ltd. (Hangzhou, China).
E. coli isolates were incubated overnight at 37◦C and diluted
to a turbidity equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard. The
inoculated MH agar plates were then incubated at 37◦C for
24 h, and the size of the zone of inhibition was used to classify
isolates as susceptible, intermediate or resistant according to CLSI
guidelines. E. coli ATCC 25922 was used as a sensitivity control.

Detection of sul Genes
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect the presence
of sul genes in all sulﬁsoxazole-resistant E. coli isolates. The
boiling method described in our previous studies was used
to obtain genomic DNA templates (Cheng et al., 2019). The
primers used to detect sul genes are shown in Table 2. Each
PCR ampliﬁcation reaction was performed in a 25 µL mixture
containing 400 nM each primer, 10 × PCR buﬀer, 200 mM
each deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), 5 U Ex-Taq DNA
polymerase (Takara-Bio, Beijing, China) and 250 ng DNA as
the template. PCR ampliﬁcation was initiated by incubating the
reaction mixture at 94◦C for 1 min; followed by 30 cycles at 98◦C
for 30 s, annealing at 56◦C (sul2) or 55◦C (sul1 and sul3) for 30 s,
and extension at 72◦C for 30 s; and a ﬁnal extension at 72◦C for
10 min. PCR products (5 µL) were mixed with 1 µL 6 × loading
buﬀer dye and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel.
Positive and negative controls were included in all PCR reactions.

Dissemination of E. coli sul Genes

Clonal Analysis by Molecular Typing
Twelve sul-positive E. coli isolates from P. vannamei and 12 sul-
positive E. coli isolates from pork samples were selected from
all sul-positive E. coli isolates and further analyzed by XbaI-
PFGE typing. The selection criteria for these 24 strains were
based on the distribution characteristics and isolation rates of
each sulfonamide resistance gene and included all sulfonamide
resistance gene arrays (for a detailed description see Table 3).
PFGE patterns were compared using BioNumerics Version 7.6
(Applied Maths, Inc., Austin, TX, United States) with a similarity
cutoﬀ of 90% to indicate identical groups. The same isolates
were also analyzed by MLST using seven housekeeping genes
(adk, fumC, gyrB, icd, mdh, purA, and recA) and the primers and
protocol speciﬁed in the online MLST database for E. coli3.

Location and Transferability of sul-Genes
The locations of sul genes were determined by Southern blotting
with digoxigenin (DIG)-labelled sul1, sul2, and sul3 probes.
Plasmid and genomic DNA were extracted using an EndoFree
Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, United States)
and a Bacteria Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Biotek, Beijing,
China), respectively. Plasmid and genomic DNA were digested
with BamHI (Fermentas, Waltham, MA, United States) at
37◦C for 5 h and then used for Southern blotting. Southern
blotting, including DIG-DNA labeling, determination of labeling
eﬃciency, DNA transfer, DNA ﬁxation, hybridization and
immunological detection, was performed using a DIG High
Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Starter Kit II (Roche Applied
Sciences, Penzberg, Germany).

Conjugation assays were performed to investigate the
transferability of sul genes. The 18 E. coli isolates that were found
by location analysis to harbor sul genes in plasmids were used
as donor strains. The rifampin-resistant E. coli strain NK5449
was used as the recipient strain. The donor strain and the
recipient strain were mixed at a ratio of 1:4 (v/v) and incubated
overnight at 37◦C in LB broth. Transconjugants were selected on
LB agar plates containing 1 mg/mL sulﬁsoxazole and 1 mg/mL
rifampicin. Plasmid DNA of transconjugants was extracted and
the presence of sul genes was conﬁrmed by PCR analysis.

Replicon Typing of Plasmids
The plasmid replicon types of all 18 transconjugants mentioned
above were determined using the previously described PCR-
based replicon typing (PBRT) method targeting 18 replicon
types (Carattoli et al., 2005). Plasmids of all 18 transconjugants
harboring sul genes were conﬁrmed by Southern blotting using
sul gene probes.

Genetic Context Analysis of sul-Genes
The genetic context of the sul genes of the 24 sul-positive E. coli
isolates mentioned above was assessed using the PCR walking
method with a Universal GenomeWalkerTM 2.0 Kit (Clontech,
Mountain View, CA, United States) and the primers listed in
Table 4. The upstream adaptor primer AP-F and the downstream
sul gene primers sul1R-1, sul2R-1, and sul3R-1 targeted the
upstream genetic context of the sul1, sul2, and sul3 genes,
respectively. The downstream adaptor primer AP-R and the
upstream sul gene primers sul1F-1, sul2F-1, and sul3F-1 targeted
the downstream genetic context of the sul1, sul2, and sul3 genes,

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

sul Gene Distribution in E. coli
As shown in Table 1, 35.7% (50/180) of the E. coli isolates
collected from P. vannamei samples were sulﬁsoxazole resistant,
and 58.3% (105/180) of the E. coli
isolates collected from
pork samples were sulﬁsoxazole resistant. E. coli isolates from
pork and aquatic food products often display resistance against
sulfonamide, as this antibiotic has been widely used to treat
bacterial and protozoan infections in swine and aquaculture.
Even in the absence of selective pressure, sulfonamide-resistant
bacteria can remain stable in the environment for 5–10 years and
persist longer than sulfonamide itself (Gao et al., 2012).

As shown in Supplementary Figure S1, sul1, sul2, and
sul3 were detected by PCR. The distribution characteristics of
E. coli sul genes were similar between the two sources. Among
all 50 sulﬁsoxazole-resistant E. coli isolates from P. vannamei
samples, 90.0% (45/50) harbored sul genes, and among all 105
sulﬁsoxazole-resistant E. coli isolates from pork samples, 88.6%
(93/105) harbored sul genes. The prevalence of sul genes was
nearly as high as the rate of sulﬁsoxazole resistance in E. coli
isolates. The remainder of sulﬁsoxazole resistance in sul-negative
isolates was likely due to mechanisms such as mutations in the
chromosomal DHPS gene ﬂop (Changkaew et al., 2014).

The prevalence rates of individual sul1 and sul2 genes in
E. coli, although variable among sampling sites, were consistently

aPrimers used in this study for the detection of sul genes were designed using
Primer Premier 5.0 software according to primer design principles.

higher than that of individual sul3 gene (p < 0.05). Moreover,
the prevalence of combined sul1 and sul2 genes was signiﬁcantly
higher than that of other gene combinations at each sampling
point. This is consistent with trends previously reported in
the literature (Antunes et al., 2005; Hammerum et al., 2006;
Byrne-Bailey et al., 2008; Hoa et al., 2008; Gao et al., 2012;
Lopes et al., 2015; Ma¸ka et al., 2015), although other studies
have reported higher prevalence of sul3 in Salmonella and

E. coli
isolates from pigs and poultry sources in Canada
(Kozak et al., 2009) and Thailand (Chuanchuen and Padungtod,
2009). These two studies also reported isolates carrying sul1,
sul2, and sul3 genes, a combination that was not detected
in our study. This discrepancy may be due to diﬀerences
in the transmission ability of the three genes in the E. coli
isolates we selected, a possibility that
is discussed in the
following sections.

Clonal Relatedness of sul-Positive E. coli
Strains
Among the 24 sul-positive E. coli
isolates, PFGE analysis
identiﬁed 19 pulsotypes that could be grouped into 18 groups.
In addition, MLST analysis identiﬁed 19 distinct sequence types
(STs). The results of PFGE and MLST analyses are summarized
in Figure 1.

PFGE results showed that, of the 12 strains detected in
P. vannamei samples, 2PV-02 and 3PV-15 had 100% similar
ﬁngerprint patterns, 2PV-22 and 1PV-38 had 100% similar
ﬁngerprint patterns, 2PV-60 and 1PV-15 had 100% similar
ﬁngerprint patterns, and 1PV-01, 3PV-52, and 2PV-19 had 100%
similar ﬁngerprint patterns. The remaining three strains (3PV-
24, 1PV-44, and 3PV-02) each had unique pulsotypes. These

Dissemination of E. coli sul Genes

results suggest potential clonal dissemination of sul-positive
E. coli isolates from P. vannamei samples. Although the E. coli
isolates in this study were recovered from three diﬀerent large
open markets on diﬀerent sampling days, all P. vannamei at
these markets were reared in the same large-scale freshwater
shrimp farm in Zhejiang Province. Therefore, high clonality
of E. coli strains circulating on the shrimp farm was likely.
Additionally, similarities between E. coli strains isolated from
diﬀerent large open markets indicates regional spreading of
clones, which may have occurred by several possible pathways,
including human contact, water sources, animals and fomites
(Alves et al., 2018). On contrary, all 12 strains collected from pork
samples had diﬀerent pulsotypes, demonstrating wide genomic
diversity. The possible non-clonal dissemination of sul genes
in E. coli
isolates from pork samples might be eﬀected by
MGEs via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) (Zhao et al., 2018).
However,
further genomic analysis is necessary to conﬁrm
this hypothesis.

Based on the results of MLST combined with the results
of PFGE, the four group J strains belonged to two diﬀerent
STs, while the remaining MLST and PFGE patterns were highly
correlated. Moreover, diﬀerent pulsotypes and STs were identiﬁed
in isolates from P. vannamei samples and pork samples. These
diﬀerences might be related to the diﬀerent regions where the
aquatic and pork products from each large market originated,

diﬀerent conditions at each farm and various transportation
routes of the two types of products (Alves et al., 2018).

Localization of sul Genes and
Characterization of sul Gene-Harboring
Plasmids
Southern blot assays showing the locations of sul1, sul2, and
sul3 are shown in Supplementary Figure S2. Location of sul
genes in the 24 E. coli strains is summarized in Table 3. Among
the 12 E. coli strains detected in P. vannamei samples, eight
strains carried sul genes only on plasmids, two strains carried
sul genes only on chromosomes and two strains carried sul
genes on both plasmids and chromosomes. Among the 12 E. coli
strains isolated from pork samples, four strains carried sul
genes only on plasmids, four strains carried sul genes only on
chromosomes and four strains carried sul genes on both plasmids
and chromosomes.

Several researchers have highlighted the vital role of plasmids
in the carriage and dissemination of sul genes (Wu et al., 2010;
Ma¸ka et al., 2015). In our study, 18 E. coli isolates harboring
sul genes on plasmids were selected for conjugation assays,
with a conjugation rate of 100% (Table 3). Replicon typing
identiﬁed seven diﬀerent incompatibility groups (F, FIA, FIB,
Y, K, I1, and N) for the plasmids (Table 3). Overall, IncF

Dissemination of E. coli sul Genes

(carrying F alone or in combination with FIA or/and FIB
as a multireplicon) seemed to be the most common replicon
associated with sul genes among E. coli
isolates from both
P. vannamei and pork samples. IncF plasmids are thought to
have a narrow host range and to be conjugative. IncF plasmids
seem to be well adapted to E. coli, as they are found in
more than 50% of E. coli strains from diﬀerent sources (Wu
et al., 2010; Hayashi et al., 2018). Of the 24 E. coli isolates in
this study, 18 were found to harbor IncF plasmids. Therefore,
sul genes located on IncF plasmids may be disseminated in
E. coli by conjugation.

Of the two plasmids from E. coli isolates from P. vannamei
that carried both sul1 and sul2 genes, one harbored the F replicon
alone and the other harbored an F-K multireplicon. Of the two
plasmids from E. coli isolates from pork samples, one harbored
an F-FIB-K multireplicon and the other harbored an F-I1-N-K
multireplicon. The I1 and N replicons were found only in E. coli
isolates from pork samples. However, due to the limited number
of strains obtained from each source, testing of additional strains
is required to determine whether speciﬁc replicon proﬁles are
associated with P. vannamei or pork.

Overall, no clear association was identiﬁed between replicon
types and speciﬁc sul genes and/or sample sources. However, the
localization of sul genes on wide-spread conjugative replicons

such as IncF and other multireplicons very likely contributes to
the dissemination of sulfonamide resistance (Wu et al., 2010).

Genetic Environments of sul Genes
In this study, we analyzed the structural characteristics of the
regions approximately 5 kb upstream and 5 kb downstream
of sul genes in 24 E. coli
isolates using the PCR walking
method. Representative primary PCR products are shown in
Supplementary Figure S3. The genetic environments of sul1,
sul2, and sul3 genes in 24 E. coli isolates were shown in Figure 2.
ISs are the simplest autonomous MGEs capable of altering
the expression of neighboring genes (Zhao et al., 2018). In the
present study, 87.5% (35/40) of sul gene-related fragments were
found to carry ISs belonging to a variety of families in diverse
sites. All were intact with their inverted repeats (IRR and IRL)
still identiﬁable. Among these, the IS6 family element IS26, which
has been reported to play a vital role in the dissemination of
resistance determinants in Gram-negative bacteria (Partridge
et al., 2018), was the most frequently occurring IS among
the 24 E. coli strains. Moreover, sul2 genes on both plasmids
(1PO-20, 2PO-14, and 3PO-48) and chromosomes (1PO-58 and
3PO-48) of E. coli
isolates from pork samples carried IS91
and IS10A, which suggested that IS91-sul2-IS10A may mediate
the dissemination of sul2 genes in E. coli in pork. Other IS

families found in our study, such as IS6100, ISIR, and IS1006,
may also have the ability to transfer sulfonamide resistance
genes by “cut-and-paste” or “copy-out-paste-in” mechanisms
(Partridge et al., 2018). In addition, IS common regions (ISCRs)
are complex genetic elements that can integrate non-genetic
cassette antibiotic resistance genes (Cheng et al., 2019). ISCR1
elements located on the chromosome of the 2PV-02 isolate from
P. vannamei were closely linked to the sul1 gene. ISCR1 appears
to be responsible for capturing and transferring many diﬀerent
antibiotic resistance genes and is often found adjacent to the
ori end of ISCR1 in complex class 1 integrons (Toleman et al.,
2006; Partridge et al., 2018). However, in the present study, ISCR1
was located downstream of the sul1 gene; therefore, its potential
role in the sul1 gene transfer requires further study. Moreover,
researchers have reported that ISCR2 is associated with several
diﬀerent resistance genes, in particular sul2 in the Glsul2 genomic
island (Partridge et al., 2018). Thus, more genetic environments
of sul genes must be analyzed to conﬁrm the relationship between
sul genes and ISCR elements.

In the present study, the sul1 gene was detected mostly
in fragments carrying the intI1 gene of class 1 integrons
(9/18), which are recognized as playing an essential role in the
dissemination of multiple antimicrobial resistance genes (Lopes
et al., 2015). Class 1 integrons are MGEs and usually carry the
sul1 gene in their 3’ conserved region along with qacE1, which
encodes a semifunctional derivate of the quaternary ammonium
compounds resistance gene qacE (Sandvang et al., 2002). aadA
and drf genes are also prevalent in class 1 integrons adjacent to
qacE1 and sul1 genes, forming a highly stable, low cost structure
with reported prevalence rates in E. coli of 63% (Lacotte et al.,
2017; Fang et al., 2019). In addition, in the present study, the
sul2 gene was commonly found to be part of a cassette structure
linked with the streptomycin resistance genes strA and strB in
the plasmid of E. coli isolates from P. vannamei, a feature that
has been reported in many other studies in both E. coli and
Salmonella (Enne et al., 2004; Bean et al., 2009; Lopes et al.,
2015; Ma¸ka et al., 2015). This cassette is not recognized as an
MGE in its own right but has been associated with other MGEs,
such as IS1294, IS1131, and IS1S. More importantly, co-location
of resistance genes in the same plasmid or fragment, such as
genes adjacent to sul1 found to encode for quinolone resistance
(qnrB4) or β-lactamase resistance (blaTEM-1 and blaDHA-1)
and genes adjacent to sul2 found to encode for tetracycline
resistance (tetA and tetR), aminoglycoside resistance (aph and
aad) and amphenicol resistance (ﬂoR), likely contribute to the
persistence and dissemination of sul1 and/or sul2 genes under
the selective pressure of other commonly used antibiotics. This
co-selection eﬀect has also been reported in other MGEs of class
2 integrons of E. coli isolates (Alonso et al., 2018). However, the
prevalence of sul3 is reportedly much lower than that of sul1 and
sul2 (Byrne-Bailey et al., 2008; Lopes et al., 2015; Ma¸ka et al.,
2015), and sul3 was rarely detected in the E. coli isolates from
P. vannamei and pork samples in our study. In this study, the
diversity of MGEs and resistance genes adjacent to sul3 was much
lower than those adjacent to sul1 and sul2, especially among
those located in chromosomes, which reduced the transmission
potential of the sul3 gene. However, other studies have found that

sul3-carrying plasmids are conjugative and associated with class
1 integrons, and can replace the sul1 gene to form atypical class 1
integrons. This underscores the potential of sul3 to become more
widespread in the future (Wu et al., 2010).

Finally, since sul gene-related fragments in E. coli isolates from
P. vannamei and pork samples were linked to various MGEs,
which facilitate intracellular and intercellular mobility, in both
plasmids and chromosomes, clonal similarities between E. coli
isolates from P. vannamei samples might be coincidental.

In conclusion, sul genes were widely distributed in E. coli
isolates from both P. vannamei and pork samples, with sul1
and sul2 being more prevalent than sul3. Because sul genes
are located on both plasmids and chromosomes, diverse gene
transfer mechanisms can contribute to the eﬃcient spread of
these genes to novel species. This was demonstrated by the
presence of conjugative and/or mobilizable plasmids of diverse
replicon types harboring sul genes and the abundant MGEs
located in the ﬂanking regions of these genes. In addition, co-
location of resistance genes likely contributed to the persistence
and dissemination of sul genes under the selective pressure
of commonly used antibiotics. Our results provide important
information to gain a better understanding of
the risk of
transmission of sul genes from seafood and meat to humans.
