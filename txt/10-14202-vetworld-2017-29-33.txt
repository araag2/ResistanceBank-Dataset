Abstract

Aim:  This  study  was  conducted  for  determination  of  the  prevalence  of  colibacillosis  in  chicken  in  poultry  farms  in 
Mymensingh and Tangail districts. Isolation, identification, and antibiogram profile of Escherichia coli were also performed.
Materials and Methods: A total of 25 chickens manifested clinical signs of colibacillosis were collected from five different 
poultry farms during natural outbreaks.
Results: In broiler, the prevalence of colibacillosis was 0.84%, and in layer, prevalence was 0.80%. The prevalence of 
colibacillosis was 1.0% and 0.5% in 25-30 days old and 31-35 days old broiler, respectively. In case of layer birds, the 
prevalence was 0.6% in 40-45 days old bird and 1% in 46-50 days old bird. Identity of the E. coli isolate of chicken was 
confirmed by sugar fermentation, biochemical tests, and polymerase chain reaction assay. Antibiogram profile of E. coli 
isolate of chicken revealed that it was multidrug resistant (resistant against two antibiotics, such as ampicillin and cefalexin).
Conclusion: Data of this study suggest that colibacillosis is prevalent in the study areas which underscore the need of 
implementation of prevention and control measure against this disease.
Keywords: chicken, colibacillosis, multidrug resistant Escherichia coli, Mymensingh, Tangail.
Introduction

Avian  pathogenic  Escherichia  coli  (APEC)  is 
the  major  cause  of  colibacillosis  in  poultry  produc-
tion  [1].  It  is  a  common  disease  in  poultry  flocks 
worldwide  especially  in  the  intensive  farming  sys-
tem [2]. It affects birds of all ages. This disease has 
an important economic impact on poultry production 
worldwide [3]. It is one of the most common causes 
of mortality in commercial layer and breeder chick-
ens [4]. Signs in birds affected with colibacillosis vary 
from sudden death to birds being off-color with their 
necks pulled into their bodies [5]. APEC strains are 
the etiologic agents of colibacillosis in birds [6].

E.  coli  is  considered  a  member  of  the  normal 
microflora of the poultry intestine, but certain strains, 
such as those designated as APEC, spread into various 
internal organs and cause colibacillosis characterized 
by  systemic  fatal  disease  [7-9]. Avian  colibacillosis 
was found widely prevalent in all age groups of chick-
ens  (9.52-36.73%)  with  especially  high  prevalence 
rate in adult layer birds (36.73%) [10].

not  regarded  as  pathogens,  they  can  be  opportunis-
tic  pathogens  that  cause  infection  in  immunocom-
promised hosts. There are also pathogenic strains of 
E. coli that when ingested, causes gastrointestinal ill-
ness in healthy humans and animals.

Treatment  of  food-producing  animals  without 
conducting  sensitivity  test  is  a  common  practice  by 
non-veterinarians. And because there are no strict reg-
ulations guiding the use of antibiotics in food-produc-
ing animals in Bangladesh, farmers often use different 
antibiotics as growth promoters/prophylaxis in brood-
ing their birds [12]. This scenario has led to selection 
pressure  and  development  of  multidrug  resistance 
among E. coli isolates. This, in turn, has resulted to 
the  increased  virulence  of  E.  coli  and  consequently 
to high rate of treatment failures and heavy economic 
losses often experienced by farmers [12].

in 
Bangladesh  [13].  Intensification  of  poultry  produc-
tion and the quick expansion of free-range production 
systems  will  increase  the  incidence  of  colibacillosis 
through  greater  exposure  of  birds  to  pathogens  and 
stress [14]. Several studies such as occurrence, patho-
logical  investigation,  and  antibiotic  sensitivity  assay 
of  colibacillosis  of  chicken  have  been  performed  in 
Bangladesh [15-18]. However, there is no comprehen-
sive study of colibacillosis in broiler and layer birds in 
greater Mymensingh district of Bangladesh. The objec-
tives of this study were (i) to isolates and identify E. coli 
from dead and sick birds by conventional bacteriologi-
cal method and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), (ii) to

of age, type and location, and (iii) to determine anti-
biogram profile of E. coli isolated from clinical cases of 
colibacillosis against five commonly used antibiotics.
Materials and Methods
Ethical approval

The  experiment  was  approved  by  Institutional 
Animal  Ethics  Committee,  Faculty  of  Veterinary 
Science, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymen-
singh 2202, Bangladesh.
Study period

This  study  was  conducted  during  the  period 

ranging from July to December 2013.
Collection of samples

Sick (n=6) and dead (n=19) birds manifesting the 
characteristics clinical signs of colibacillosis (watery 
diarrhea, weakness, anorexia and weight loss, etc.) were 
collected from five poultry farms in Mymensingh and 
Tangail districts (Table-1). Feces samples of sick birds 
were  collected  aseptically  in  sterile  test  tubes.  Sick 
birds  were  euthanized  by  intracardiac  administration 
of saturated MgSO4 solution. A thorough post-mortem 
examination of all dead birds was carried out. Liver 
and spleen samples were collected separately in sterile 
test tubes. Feces, liver, and spleen samples were used 
for bacteriological study (Table-2).

Age (broiler 25-30 days and 31-35 days old and 
layer 40-45 days and 46-50 days old), chicken line and 
location of the farms were recorded.
Isolation of bacteria in pure culture

Samples were enriched in nutrient broth at 37°C 
for 24 h. The overnight bacterial broths were streaked 
onto eosin methylene blue (EMB) agar and incubated 
at 37°C for 24 h. Single colony was further sub-cul-
tured until a pure culture was obtained.
Identification of bacteria

Colony  characteristics  of  bacteria  such  as 
shape, size, surface texture, edge, elevation and color 
observed  in  pure  culture,  Gram’s-staining  and  bio-
chemical tests (sugar fermentation, methyl red, Voges-
Proskauer and Indole production tests) were used for 
identification of bacteria [19].
Molecular detection of E. coli by PCR
DNA extraction

A pure bacterial colony was mixed with 100 µl of 
distilled water which was boiled for 10 min then imme-
diately kept on ice for cold shock. Finally, centrifugation 

Table-1: Summary of chicken samples and study areas.

was done at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was 
collected and used as DNA template for PCR.
Primers used for PCR

A genus-specific PCR was performed to amplify 
16S rRNA of E. coli using previously published prim-
ers [20]. The list of primer is furnished in Table-3.
Antibiotic sensitivity test

Three  isolates  randomly  selected  from  the  sam-
ples  were  tested  for  antimicrobial  drug  susceptibility 
against  five  commonly  used  antibiotics  such  as  ampi-
cillin  (10  µg/disc),  chloramphenicol  (30  µg/disc),  cip-
rofloxacin  (5  µg/disc),  gentamicin  (10  µg/disc),  and 
cefalexin (30 µg/disc) by disk diffusion or Kirby-Bauer 
method [20]. Results of antibiotic sensitivity tests were 
recorded as sensitive and resistant according to the guide-
lines of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [21].
Statistical analysis

The  prevalence  of  colibacillosis  in  broiler  and 
layer at different age groups of bird and poultry farm 
compared for statistical significance using Chi-square 
test (Duncan’s multiple range test, SPSS 11.5, UK). 
A p≤0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
Results
Isolation of E. coli on EMB media

The  growth  of  E.  coli  on  EMB  agar  was  indi-
cated by smooth, circular, black color colonies with 
metallic sheen.
Identification of E. coli

E. coli on EMB agar produced greenish black col-
ony with metallic sheen. On MacConkey agar it produced 
bright, pink colored, transparent smooth and raised col-
onies.  Pink  colored,  rod-shaped,  short  chain,  single  or 
paired Gram-negative bacilli were observed after Gram’s 
staining. It fermented five basic sugars such as dextrose, 
sucrose, lactose, maltose, and mannitol with the produc-
tion of both acid and gas. Acid production was indicated 
by the color change from reddish to yellow, and gas pro-
duction was noted by the presence of gas bubbles in the 
inverted Durham’s tubes. All E. coli isolates were cata-
lase, indole, M-R positive, and V-P negative.
Overall prevalence of colibacillosis in chicken

The  overall  prevalence  of  colibacillosis  was 

0.84% in broiler and 0.80% in layer (Table-4).

old  broiler  and  0.5%  in  31-35  days  old  broiler. 
On  the  other  hand,  prevalence  was  0.6%  in 
40-45 days old layer and 1% in 46-50 days old lay-
ers. Prevalence of colibacillosis in broiler and layer 
at different age groups was statistically significant 
(p=0.006).
Farm wise prevalence of colibacillosis in chicken

The farm wise prevalence of colibacillosis was 
0.7%  in  Bangladesh Agricultural  University  (BAU) 
broiler farm, 0.4% in CP broiler farm, 1.2% in Abu 
Tarek broiler farm, 1.2% in Nahar broiler farm, and 
0.8% in Sotota layer farm (Table-6). The prevalence 
of colibacillosis in all farms was found to be statisti-
cally significant (p=0.0054).
Molecular detection of E. coli

DNA extracted from three E. coli isolates were 
used  in  the  PCR  assay.  PCR  primers  targeting  16S 
rRNA of E. coli amplified 704 bp fragments of DNA 
confirming the identity of E. coli (Figure-1).

Results of antibiotics sensitivity tests

On  the  basis  of  zone  of  inhibition  E.  coli  iso-
lates were found to be sensitive against ciprofloxacin, 
gentamicin and chloramphenicol and resistant against 
ampicillin and cefalexin (Figure-2).
Discussion

Avian colibacillosis caused by E. coli is a major 
health problem in poultry industry [2]. In this study, 
an attempt was undertaken for determination of prev-
alence  of  colibacillosis  in  broiler  and  layer  chicken 
from field outbreaks. In this study, chicken clinically 
infected with colibacillosis manifested characteristics 
clinical sign of colibacillosis such as watery diarrhea, 
anorexia, weakness, and loss of body weight. A sim-
ilar  type  of  clinical  signs  in  colibacillosis  was  also 
recorded [22]. This study recorded 0.84% prevalence 
of colibacillosis in broiler and 0.80% in layer chicken. 
Higher  prevalence  of  colibacillosis  was  found  in 
broiler chicken (87.5%) than layer (76.04%) [23].

Prevalence  of  colibacillosis  was  recorded  28% 
in  Sonali  chicken  on  smallholder  households  in 
Bangladesh [13]. 5.51% prevalence of colibacillosis 
was  reported  in  chicken  in  Mymensingh  district  of 
Bangladesh [24]. A study found 20.9% colibacillosis in 
chicken in small or medium scale commercial poultry 
farms in Mymensingh and its neighboring district [25]. 
10.61% colibacillosis was recorded in chicken at the 
Central Disease Investigation Laboratory, Dhaka [26]. 
A study conducted in South Korea recorded (32.6%) 
prevalence of colibacillosis in broiler flock and 27.2% 
prevalence  in  layer  flock  [18].  In  Pakistan,  8.9% 
colibacillosis  was  recorded  in  poultry  farms  around 
Faisalabad [27].

This study recorded 1% and 0.5% prevalence of 
colibacillosis in broiler belonged to 1 month and more

isolate suggested that they are multi-drug resistant. In 
another study, E. coli isolate of chicken was resistant 
to ampicillin [31]. E. coli isolate of chicken were also 
resistant  to  ampicillin  [32,33].  Multi-drug  resistant 
E. coli was reported in the healthy broiler chicken [34].
Antimicrobial  therapy  is  an  important  tool  in 
reducing  huge  losses  in  poultry  industry  caused  by 
E. coli infection [35]. In this study, E. coli isolate of 
poultry was found sensitive to gentamicin, chloram-
phenicol, and ciprofloxacin. These antibiotics may be 
used for the treatment of clinical cases of colibacillo-
sis of chicken. Antibiotic sensitivity profile of E. coli 
isolate of chicken recorded in this study is in agree-
ment with the findings of others [31,32]. The current 
resistance phenotypes with MDR are similar to data 
reported from other researchers [36-38].
Conclusion

This  study  documented  the  prevalence  of  coli-
bacillosis in layer and broiler birds in the study areas. 
E. coli isolated from colibacillosis affected birds were 
found to be sensitive to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and 
chloramphenicol which could be used to treat the clin-
ical cases of colibacillosis in poultry. Regular vacci-
nation program along with strict biosecurity measures 
need  to  be  undertaken  to  prevent  this  economically 
important disease in poultry.

this study recorded 0.6% prevalence up to 45 days old 
layer and 1% prevalence up to 50 days old layer. 9.52-
36. 73% colibacillosis was found in all age group of
bird [10]. The highest prevalence of colibacillosis was 
recorded in adult layer (36.73%) [10], but this study 
recorded  lower  prevalence  in  40-45  days  old  layer 
(0.6%) as compared to 46-50 days old layer (1%).

In this study, EMB agar was used for isolation 
of E. coli from clinical samples. Colony character-
istics  of E.  coli  observed  on  EMB  agar  were  sim-
ilar  to  the  findings  [28].  Morphologically,  E.  coli 
were  Gram-negative  short  rod  arranged  in  sin-
gle  or  paired  and  motile.  Another  researcher  also 
described similar cultural and staining characteris-
tics  of  E.  coli  [29].  The  fact  that  pure  cultures  of 
E. coli were isolated from all the cultured samples 
established  the  incidence  of  colibacillosis  in  the 
farm [4]. The identity of E. coli spp. was confirmed 
by sugar fermentation and biochemical tests. In this 
study,  PCR  assay  using  specific  primers  amplified 
704 bp fragment of 16S rRNA gene of E. coli iso-
lates of chicken. Similar results were also observed 
by another researcher [30].

In  this  study,  E.  coli  isolates  of  chicken  were 
found  to  be  resistant  against  two  antibiotics  such  as
