Objectives: To describe the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among commensal Escherichia coli isolates on
household and small-scale chicken farms, common in southern Vietnam, and to investigate the association of
antimicrobial resistance with farming practices and antimicrobial usage.

Methods: We collected data on farming and antimicrobial usage from 208 chicken farms. E. coli was isolated
from boot swab samples using MacConkey agar (MA) and MA with ceftazidime, nalidixic acid or gentamicin.
Isolates were tested for their susceptibility to 11 antimicrobials and for ESBL production. Risk factor analyses
were carried out, using logistic regression, at both the bacterial population and farm levels.

Results: E. coli resistant to gentamicin, ciproﬂoxacin and third-generation cephalosporins was detected on 201
(96.6%), 191 (91.8%) and 77 (37.0%) of the farms, respectively. Of the 895 E. coli isolates, resistance to genta-
micin, ciproﬂoxacin and third-generation cephalosporins was detected in 178 (19.9%), 291 (32.5%) and 29
(3.2%) of the isolates, respectively. Ciproﬂoxacin resistance was signiﬁcantly associated with quinolone usage
(OR¼2.26) and tetracycline usage (OR¼1.70). ESBL-producing E. coli were associated with farms containing
ﬁsh ponds (OR¼4.82).
Conclusions: Household and small farms showed frequent antimicrobial usage associated with a high prevalence
of resistance to the most commonly used antimicrobials. Given the weak biocontainment, the high prevalence of
resistant E. coli could represent a risk to the environment and to humans.

Introduction

Antimicrobials are extensively used in animal farming with the
aim of treating and preventing animal diseases, as well as
improving growth performance.1 The overuse of antimicrobials
in food-animal farming is an important factor contributing to
the emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial-resistant

organisms in animal production systems, and contributes at
an unknown level to the overall problem of antimicrobial resist-
ance (AMR) in human medicine.2 The use of ﬂuoroquinolones,
aminoglycosides and third-generation cephalosporins in animal
farming is of particular concern, since these are among the most
important antimicrobials currently available to treat serious
human infections.3

Nguyen et al.

Commensal Escherichia coli organisms are commonly used to
monitor the prevalence of AMR in livestock and poultry, since they
reﬂect well the selective pressure on Gram-negative enteric bac-
teria.4,5 AMR determinants present in E. coli that are selected or
ampliﬁed on farms may spread to humans through direct contact,
by the consumption of meat or indirectly through environmental
pathways.6 Furthermore, some animal-derived E. coli strains can
also be pathogenic to humans or may act as a donor of AMR genes
to other pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae.7,8

A number of studies have demonstrated an overall higher
prevalence of AMR among chicken E. coli compared with human
E. coli isolates7,9 and have incriminated chickens as a source of
ﬂuoroquinolone-resistant, extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli infec-
tions in humans.7,10 Because of this, the recently observed
increase in plasmid-mediated resistance to ﬂuoroquinolones
among E. coli of chicken origin is of concern.5,11 Human infections
caused by microorganisms that are resistant to third- and fourth-
generation cephalosporins owing to the acquisition of ESBL genes
have increased rapidly worldwide since they were ﬁrst described in
1989. Recent reports have shown the presence of ESBL-producing
E. coli in poultry12 – 14 and a great level of molecular similarity
between ESBL-producing E. coli from chicken meat and humans,
suggesting that chickens are a major source of this.15 – 17 A rise in
aminoglycoside resistance in Gram-negative microorganisms has
been described in European and Asian countries.18 In Vietnam,
antimicrobials including ﬂuoroquinolones and aminoglycosides
are extensively used in large-scale pig and poultry farming,19 – 21
and a high prevalence of AMR to the two classes of antimicrobials
has been observed in both commensal and zoonotic bacteria from
farms and meat.22,23

Vietnam is an agricultural country with around 70% of the
population living in rural areas. Around 40% of households
engage in poultry-raising,24 and 94% of these 8 million house-
holds have a ﬂock size of ,50 chickens.25 Little is known about
the prevalence of AMR in E. coli in such relatively small production
systems or about its potential association with antimicrobial use
and other farming practices. It is often assumed that, compared
with larger farms, backyard farms use fewer antimicrobial drugs
and more often feed their chickens with by-products instead of
(often medicated) commercial feed. We therefore carried out a
survey to investigate the prevalence of AMR in E. coli indicator bac-
teria in Vietnamese household and small chicken farms, with the
aims of: (i) estimating the prevalence of E. coli resistant to key
antimicrobials, with a focus on ﬂuoroquinolones, aminoglycosides
and third-generation cephalosporins; and (ii) identifying risk fac-
tors for the faecal carriage of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli in
chickens, including demographics, management practices and
antimicrobial usage.

Methods
Study population
With an area of 2481 km2, the province of Tien Giang (Vietnam) is home to
(cid:2)1.67 million people and (cid:2)5.96 million chickens. For logistical reasons, the
study was conducted in 3 districts (My Tho, Cho Gao and Chau Thanh) out
of the 10 in the province as they contain 44.5% of the total chicken popu-
lation of the province. The study population consisted of 208 chicken
farms, equally divided into two strata according to the number of chickens
per farm: ≥10–200 (‘household’ farms) and .200–2000 (‘small’ farms, in
contrast to large scale farms with .2000 chickens). To avoid regional

biases in the sampling, 34 farms from each of the four strata (district-farm
size combinations) in Cho Gao and My Tho and 36 farms from each of the
two strata in Chau Thanh were selected.

The number of farms to be sampled from each commune (the lower
administrative unit within a district) was calculated with a probability
that was directly proportional to the number of farms in that commune
according to the Vietnamese rural, agricultural and ﬁshery census in
2006.26 Farms were randomly sampled from each chosen commune.
Farmers refusing to participate were replaced by the next eligible farm.

Written informed consent was obtained from all farmers prior to par-
ticipation in the study. The study was approved by the Sub-Department of
Animal Health (SDAH) and the Peoples’ Committee of Tien Giang Province.

Data collection
The farm visits were evenly distributed over the period March 2012 to April
2013 to avoid seasonal effects. Data on antimicrobial usage and farm
management practices were collected using a structured questionnaire,
which was conceived in a workshop including local facilitators and was
tested in the ﬁeld prior to sampling (available as Supplementary data at
JAC Online). The questionnaire was aimed at the person with primary
responsibility for chicken husbandry and contained both open and closed
questions. This person was asked about details of the administration of
any antibacterial formulation from restocking until the date of the visit
for farms applying all-in-all-out (AIAO) systems, and for a ﬁxed period of
90 days for the remaining farms not practising AIAO.

SDAH staff gathered data on each antibacterial formulation adminis-
tered (excluding coccidiostats and antiparasitic and antifungal drugs),
including the commercial name of the product, the presentation and
the number of containers used. To facilitate the farmers’ recall, open dis-
cussions were initiated after inspecting the medicine cabinet for all pro-
ducts present that contained antibacterial formulations. This approach
is analogous to the medicine cabinet survey used in human medicine,
which has been shown to be highly effective in obtaining information on
the community usage of antimicrobial drugs.27

Sample collection
From each ﬂock, naturally pooled chicken faeces were collected from rep-
resentative sections of the chicken pens/houses using two (household
farms) or three (small farms) pairs of boot swabs attached to footwear.
For unconﬁned ﬂocks, boot swab samples were collected from the areas
where the chickens roosted at night. Boot swabs were used to walk at least
30 steps on areas where fresh droppings were visible. For ﬂocks housed on
stilts or caged ﬂocks where it was not possible to use boot swabs, visible
faecal material was collected using two to three hand-held gauze swabs,
which were similar in size to the boot swabs, each collecting material from
at least 10 different locations.

The swab samples were immediately stored at 48C, transferred to the
laboratory in Ho Chi Minh City and cultured within 24 h after sample col-
lection. Both the interviews and the faecal sample collection were con-
ducted by trained veterinarians from Tien Giang SDAH.

E. coli isolation
A ﬁxed volume (225 mL) of buffered peptone water was added to each
gauze or boot swab in a separate container and was then manually
shaken. A volume of 1 mL from each container was pipetted and pooled
into a sample. From this pooled sample, 1 mL was further diluted
1:1000 in saline solution, and 50 mL of this suspension was plated onto
MacConkey agar without supplement and MacConkey agar supplemented
with ceftazidime (2 mg/L) to select for isolates with reduced susceptibility
to third-generation cephalosporins, nalidixic acid (16 mg/L) to select for
isolates with reduced susceptibility to quinolones, or gentamicin (8 mg/L)

Prevalence and risk factors for carriage of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli on chicken farms in Vietnam

JAC

to select for isolates with reduced susceptibility to gentamicin. This was
then incubated at 378C overnight. The total number of suspect E. coli col-
onies was counted for each plate. A random selection of ﬁve (MacConkey
agar not supplemented) and two (MacConkey agar supplemented with
antimicrobial drugs) presumptive E. coli colonies of different morphologies
were subcultured and were identiﬁed as E. coli using standard biochemical
tests (hydrogen sulphide production, carbohydrate fermentation, urease
test, nitrate reductase test, methyl red test, motility test and indole test)
and/or API 20E (bioMe´rieux, France). Isolates conﬁrmed as E. coli were
tested for their antimicrobial susceptibility.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
For the determination of antimicrobial susceptibility, the disc diffusion
method was performed and interpreted according to breakpoints as
deﬁned by the CLSI.28 The following antimicrobials were tested at the
given disc content: ampicillin (10 mg), ceftriaxone (30 mg), ceftazidime
(30 mg), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (30 mg), chloramphenicol (30 mg),
ciproﬂoxacin (5 mg), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (1.25/23.75 mg),
gentamicin (10 mg), amikacin (30 mg), tetracycline (30 mg) and merope-
nem (10 mg). The potential production of ESBLs, as indicated by resistance
to ceftriaxone and/or ceftazidime and by an inhibitory effect of clavulanic
acid, was conﬁrmed using a double disc diffusion test according to CLSI
guidelines. Strains with an intermediate susceptible result were considered
resistant. An MDR strain was deﬁned as a strain resistant to at least three
different classes of antimicrobials. A farm was deﬁned as ‘positive’ for a
resistant E. coli if at least one E. coli isolate resistant to the antimicrobial
drug under study was cultured from MacConkey agar either with or with-
out supplementation with antimicrobial drugs. Quality controls for identi-
ﬁcation and susceptibility testing were performed on a weekly basis
according to CLSI guidelines.

Since all the MacConkey agar plates (i.e. with or without supplementa-
tion with antimicrobial drugs) were streaked using an identical inoculum,
the counts of E. coli-like colonies on each plate were used to determine the
proportion of colonies resistant to ceftazidime, gentamicin and nalidixic
acid in relation to the total E. coli population for each farm.

Data analyses
Since the study was designed as a stratiﬁed survey with a ﬁxed number of
farms in each stratum, not all the study units (farms) had the same prob-
ability of being selected. The prevalence of resistance to each antimicrobial
of a randomly selected isolate cultured from non-selective plates, as well
as the prevalence of resistance by farm, was adjusted for the stratiﬁed sur-
vey design by assigning a stratum-speciﬁc sampling weight (Wi) to each
observation unit (either isolate or farm) using the following equation:
Wi¼NT/Ni, where NT is the total number of farms in the three study districts
(29106) and Ni is the number of farms in each stratum sampled (i¼1 . . .6).
Standard errors were corrected to take into account potential similarities
of prevalence between the farms in each stratum.29

The frequency of antimicrobial treatment was quantiﬁed by calculating
the treatment incidence (TI) as previously described.30 The TI is deﬁned
as the number of chickens per 1000 that are treated daily with one DDD
of each antimicrobial administered on each farm using the following
formula:

TI =

[total amount of antimicrobial administered (mg)]

[DDDs (mg/kg)×number of days at risk
×total weight of chickens on farm (kg)]

The total amount of an antimicrobial administered was calculated using:
(i) the total consumption as reported by the farmer (i.e. the number of con-
tainers of antimicrobial-containing products used); (ii) the concentration
of the product; and (iii) the reporting usage period.

The animal DDD was estimated based on the dosage mentioned in the
drug’s instruction leaﬂet. In case the medication was dissolved in drinking
water or feed, the dosage as indicated by the manufacturer was standar-
dized to mg/kg chicken body weight, given that an average chicken con-
sumes 190 mL of water and 80 g of feed per day. The average weight of
one chicken was considered to be 1 kg.31 The Anatomical Therapeutic
Chemical classiﬁcation system for veterinary medicinal products (ATCvet)32
was used for antimicrobial drug identiﬁcation.

To determine the risk factors associated with resistance that are con-
sidered of clinical importance for human medicine, we modelled the prob-
ability of a randomly selected E. coli isolate from any given farm for the
following three outcomes: (i) resistance to ciproﬂoxacin; (ii) resistance to
gentamicin; and (iii) multidrug resistance. This was carried out by building
hierarchical generalized linear mixed regression models with the term
‘farm’ modelled as a random effect.

For the outcome ‘resistance to third-generation cephalosporins’, where
we observed a very low probability of resistance among individual ran-
domly selected E. coli isolates (3.2%), culture results from supplemented
and unsupplemented plates were combined and standard logistic regres-
sion models were built to model the probability of the presence of resistant
strains on the farm.

To build each model, a total of 42 variables were ﬁrst tested in univari-
able analyses, including factors describing the farms (production type, size
and presence of other animals), farmers’ demographic factors, husbandry
factors and antimicrobial usage (see the Supplementary data for all the
variables that were included). Variables were considered as a candidate
for multivariable analysis based on their biological plausibility and a
P value ,0.15 in the univariable analyses. Candidate variables were ranked
by their degree of signiﬁcance and were included in the models starting
with the most signiﬁcant and using a stepwise forward approach.33 In
the ﬁnal multivariable models, variables were retained if their P value
was ,0.05. All
interactions between all signiﬁcant variables in the
model were assessed.

All statistical analyses were performed using the packages epicalc and

survey with R statistical software (http://www.r-project.org).

Results
Description of farm demographic and management
factors
Of the 104 household farms, 76.0% raised chickens for meat,
whereas 23.1% raised chickens with a mixed purpose (meat
and eggs). In contrast, 60.6% of the 104 small farms raised
egg-laying ﬂocks and 38.5% raised meat chickens (Table 1). The
conﬁnement of chickens in pens or houses for 24 h per day was
more common in small farms compared with household farms
(89.4% versus 1.9%, respectively) (P,0.001). The percentage of
small farms that used commercial feed (99.0%) was greater
than the percentage of household farms that followed this prac-
tice (70.2%) (P,0.001).

Prevalence of AMR in E. coli isolates
A total of 895 E. coli isolates were recovered from unsupplemen-
ted MacConkey agar. The crude (unadjusted) and adjusted preva-
lence of resistance in the E. coli isolates are presented in Table 2.
Among these randomly selected E. coli isolates, the adjusted
prevalence of resistance to ciproﬂoxacin was 24.2% (Table 2).
The adjusted prevalence of resistance to gentamicin was 15.0%
and to ‘any third-generation cephalosporin’ (ceftazidime and/or
ceftriaxone) was 3.1% (Table 2). A total of 81.3% of isolates
were MDR (Table 2).

Prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli on
chicken farms
E. coli isolates resistant to tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfameth-
oxazole, chloramphenicol and ampicillin were detected on
100% of farms. Isolates resistant to gentamicin (98.2%), amoxi-
cillin/clavulanic acid (95.0%) and ciproﬂoxacin (92.8%) were also
prevalent at most farms, whereas isolates resistant to ceftriaxone
(44.6%), ceftazidime (44.2%) and amikacin (22.3%) were less
common. At least one ESBL-producing E. coli isolate was recov-
ered from 20.6% of farms. MDR E. coli isolates were identiﬁed at
all farms (Table 2).

population in each farm was estimated and is depicted in
Figure 1. Colonies resistant to gentamicin and nalidixic acid
accounted for 100% of E. coli-like colonies for 9 (4.3%) and 32
(15.4%) farms, respectively.

Antimicrobial usage
The TIs of different classes of antimicrobial drugs are shown in
Table 3. The mean TI was highest for tetracyclines (90.8) followed
by macrolides (73.3), penicillins (52.1) and polymyxins (51.3)
(Table 3). The TI for overall antimicrobial drug consumption was
370.6, meaning that, on average per day, 371 chickens out of
1000 were treated with one DDD of an antimicrobial drug.

Prevalence and risk factors for carriage of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli on chicken farms in Vietnam

shoes/boots (OR¼0.22) as well as between the usage of commer-
cial feed and use of the AIAO method (OR¼10.99).
Lincosamide (OR¼ 4.74) and tetracycline (OR¼ 1.99) usage
was associated with resistance to gentamicin in E. coli isolates.
In addition, farming strategies, including a change shoes/boots
practice (OR¼ 2.41), the purchase of day-old chickens from
sources other than industrial hatchery companies (local hatcheries,
markets, neighbours etc.) (OR¼ 4.93) and raising chickens for
meat or mixed (meat and egg) purposes, but not solely for
egg-laying purposes, (OR¼ 9.88 and OR¼ 5.03, respectively)
were associated with the isolation of gentamicin-resistant E.
coli. A high density of chickens (number of chickens per m2) was
associated with both gentamicin resistance and multidrug resist-
ance. We observed a 32% and 28% increase in the odds of isolat-
ing gentamicin-resistant or MDR E. coli, respectively, for a one unit
increase in chicken density (chickens per m2). The use of commer-
cial feed was also associated with the isolation of MDR E. coli
(OR¼2.49). The risk of carriage of MDR E. coli was decreased by
4.0% for a one unit increase in the farmer’s number of years of
experience of chicken-farming.
The presence of ﬁsh pond(s) (OR¼2.93, 95% CI¼1.11–7.76)
and the usage of any antimicrobial drug (OR¼ 2.80, 95%
CI¼ 1.08 – 7.28) were associated with resistance to third-
generation cephalosporins in E. coli. The presence of ﬁsh pond(s)
(OR¼4.82, 95% CI¼1.27–18.27), the purchase of day-old chick-
ens from other sources (local hatcheries, markets, neighbours
etc.) compared with day-old chickens from industrial hatchery
companies (OR¼ 13.02, 95% CI¼ 1.89 – 89.61) and having a
change shoes/boots practice on the farm (OR¼ 3.4, 95%
CI¼ 0.98 – 11.81) were associated with the presence of ESBL-
producing E. coli on the farm.

Discussion
This study demonstrated a very high (81.3%) prevalence of MDR
E. coli isolated from household and small-scale chicken farms in
an unbiased study population in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam.
The prevalence of resistance to both ciproﬂoxacin (24.2%) and
gentamicin (15.0%) was substantial, while resistance to third-
generation cephalosporins (3.1%) was of a much lower level.
The prevalence of resistance among chicken farms based on the
isolation of resistant E. coli using selective culture media was very
high (Table 2). Our results indicate a generally higher or similar
prevalence of AMR among chicken E. coli isolates from Vietnam
to commonly used antimicrobials (tetracycline, chloramphenicol,
ampicillin and gentamicin) compared with results from industria-
lized countries.34 – 36 Data from seven European countries suggest
a higher prevalence of ciproﬂoxacin resistance (57.6%), while data
from ﬁve European countries indicate a higher prevalence of cef-
tazidime resistance (11.1%) in chickens in these countries.37
Although such comparisons should be interpreted with caution
because of differences in sampling methods as well as differences
in the breakpoints used for interpreting susceptibility test results
between studies from different regions, the high prevalence of
AMR observed in these backyard farms in Vietnam is striking and
unexpected.

The observed high prevalence of AMR reﬂects the common
use of antimicrobial products for therapeutic and prophylactic
purposes, as found in our survey on antimicrobial drug usage.

Even though there was a large variation in TI between farms
and between antimicrobial drugs, the TI of any antimicrobial
drug usage calculated in our study (370.6) was much higher
than the TI calculated for countries with industrial broiler produc-
tion such as Belgium (131.8), the Netherlands (82.2) and Denmark
(8.2).30,38 However, such comparisons should be interpreted
with caution given the differences in study design. In addition,
most of these products were available without prescription in a
pilot survey across 20 veterinary drug stores in the area (data
not shown).

We found statistical associations between the usage of quino-
lones and tetracyclines and ciproﬂoxacin resistance, as well as
between the usage of tetracyclines and lincosamides and re-
sistance to gentamicin. Other ﬁeld studies have also demon-
strated that the use of quinolones selects for the carriage of
quinolone-resistant E. coli in poultry.4,39 The association between
tetracycline use and quinolone resistance may be explained by an
effect of tetracycline-induced mutations in the mar operon result-
ing in an overexpression of MarA, which increases resistance to
multiple drugs including quinolones.40 Finally, the co-selection
of resistance determinants, encoded by genes located on mobile
elements such as integrons, could explain the observed associ-
ation between the usage of tetracyclines and lincomycin, which
is often formulated in combination with spectinomycin, and
resistance to gentamicin.41 We acknowledge the limitations in
obtaining accurate usage data derived from a cross-sectional
study design. Recall biases with regard to data on usage may
have introduced error with an unknown impact on the observed
associations. In addition, we tried to use the TIs of different anti-
microbials as continuous variables in the risk factor analyses.
However, we did not succeed in achieving a stable model with
these continuous variables and as a result we had to consider
them as binary variables for the analyses. Despite these limita-
tions, our study provides a unique view on antimicrobial drug
usage and associated AMR in backyard chicken farms in Vietnam.
The use of commercial feed was associated with an increased
risk of ﬂuoroquinolone resistance and multidrug resistance, in
agreement with a study on turkey farms in Europe,39 and reﬂects
the fact that in Vietnam commercial poultry feed is commonly
medicated with antimicrobials.42 In this study, we randomly
collected 25 feed samples from 25 different chicken farms
and tested these for the presence of antimicrobial agents
(Premi-Test, R-Biopharm AG). Antimicrobial compound(s) were
detected in all the feed samples (data not shown). The test does
not, however, allow a further identiﬁcation of the antimicrobial
compounds that were present or their concentrations in the feed.
Independent of antimicrobial drug or medicated feed usage,
there was mixed evidence of an association between the intensi-
ﬁcation of chicken production and AMR. For example, E. coli
isolates from household farms had clearly lower levels of cipro-
ﬂoxacin resistance than isolates from small farms, and an
increase in density of the chickens was associated with gentami-
cin resistance and multidrug resistance. In contrast, AIAO sys-
tems, which were more commonly observed at the larger farms,
decreased the risk of ciproﬂoxacin resistance, while the purchase
of day-old chickens from company hatcheries and the production
of layer ﬂocks were associated with lower levels of gentamicin
resistance, in line with studies in Europe that have reported a
much lower level of gentamicin resistance in layer chickens com-
pared with broiler chickens.37

Nguyen et al.

We did not ﬁnd evidence of any usage of third-generation
cephalosporins on any chicken farm surveyed. However,
in
Vietnam, cephalosporins are among the antimicrobial classes
most commonly used in human medicine.43,44 It is therefore pos-
sible that there may have been a transmission of resistance deter-
minants from humans or other species (e.g. pigs) to chickens,
which would explain the observed, albeit low-prevalence, resist-
ance to ceftazidime and ceftriaxone. We found that the presence
of an integrated ﬁsh pond at a farm was associated with the iso-
lation of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant and ESBL-pro-
ducing E. coli. We speculate that this association was related to
the contact of the chicken with ﬁsh pond water, which would
underscore the relevance of human activities for AMR in poultry,
since a relatively high proportion of households in the rural
areas of the Mekong Delta do not have latrines that meet estab-
lished hygiene standards in terms of their construction, operation
and maintenance.45 A recent study in China suggested that the
presence of ESBL-positive Enterobacteriaceae in ﬁsh farms was
likely to have originated from contamination with human sew-
age.46 Further comparisons of isolates from humans, chickens
and ﬁsh ponds should help to elucidate this relationship.

We have identiﬁed several potential risk factors for AMR in
household and small-scale farms in southern Vietnam, which
include antimicrobial usage, farm management practices and
environmental risks. Given the existing low levels of ‘biocontain-
ment’ on these farms and the rare use of personal protective
equipment for farming personnel when dealing with the animals,
as well as the fact that there is a great degree of overlap between
the farming and the household environments, the risks of trans-
mission of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli posed to both farmers
and the communities living in the proximity of chicken farms are
likely to be high. These need to be properly assessed in order to
formulate effective strategies to limit the further development
of resistance to safeguard human health.
