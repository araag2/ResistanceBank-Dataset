Abstract: Problem statement: Increased emergence in microbial resistance to antibiotics is a growing 
problem  in  Bangladesh,  a  tropical  country  with  a  large  agrarian  population  having  limited  medical 
facilities.  Wide  spread  use  of  antimicrobials  in  poultry  farming  here  is  a  concern  of  multi-drug 
microbial resistance development that can potentially be transmitted to human pathogens even from 
non-pathogenic carrier strains. Attempt was made to assess drug susceptibility in Escherichia coli from 
poultry sources of Bangladesh. Approach: Eighty selected strains isolated from poultry sources were 
thoroughly  characterized  by  standard  cultural  and  biochemical  tests  followed  by  final  identification 
using latex agglutination test of polyvalent anti-sera, from which 50 were tested for susceptibility to 13 
antibiotics following disk diffusion method. Results: 145 (58 %) samples, out of total 250, were found 
positive  for  E.  coli.  52-88  %  of  tested  E.  coli  strains  from  poultry  sources  were  found  resistant  to 
Penicillin,  Ciprofloxacin,  Riphampicin,  Kanamycin,  Streptomycin,  Cefixine,  Erythromycin, 
Ampicillin, Tetracycline, and 20 % strains showed resistance to both Chloramphenicol and Neomycin.  
No strains showed resistance to Norfloxacin and Gentamicin. Sensitivity was recorded in case of 60-86 
% strains to Norfloxacin, Gentamicin, Chloramphenicol, and Neomycin; and 26-36 % strains against 
Tetracycline,  Streptomycin,  and  Ampicillin.  Intermediate  resistance/  susceptibility  to  various 
antibiotics were observed for 12-36 % Escherichia coli strains. Both, resistance and susceptibility were 
exhibited  against  Chloramphenicol,  Ampicillin,  Gentamicin,  Neomycin,  Tetracycline,  Streptomycin 
and  Norfloxacin.  Multi  drug  resistance  was  found  in  case  of  6-10  antibiotics  for  all  strains  tested. 
Conclusion: Further study is required on the role of poultry borne bacteria as vectors in transmitting 
drug resistance. Attention is to be paid for personnel hygiene in processing and handling of poultry and 
poultry products; and excess use or abuse of antibiotics should be reduced or stopped by the judicious 
application of antibiotics for the safety of public health in Bangladesh.

veterinary  and  human  medicine[9,10].  It  was  stated  by 
well established evidence that antibiotics can lead to the 
emergence and dissemination of resistant E. coli which 
can then be passed into people via food or direct contact 
with  infected  animals.  These  resistant  microbes  may 
function  as  a  potential  source  in  the  transportation  of 
antimicrobial  resistance  to  human  pathogens[11,12].  At 
butchery/  slaughter,  resistant  strains  from  the  gut 
readily contaminate poultry carcasses which often cause 
contamination  of  poultry  meats  and  eggs  during  lay 
with multi resistant E. coli[13-15]. 
Due to enormous exploitation of antibiotics in the 
 
field  of  veterinary  medicine,  an  increased  number  of 
resistant  bacterial  strains  were  developed  in  recent 
years. The transmission of plasmid mediated resistance 
between different bacterial species and genera are now 
widely  occurred[16].  In  different  parts  of  the  world, 
multi drug resistant strains of E. coli are ubiquitous in 
both  human  and  animal  isolates[17]  and  multiple  drug 
resistant, nonpathogenic E. coli found in the intestine is 
probably an  important  reservoir  of  resistance  genes[18] 
and momentarily drug-resistant E. coli of animal origin 
may  colonize  the  human  intestine[19].  Acquired  multi 
drug  resistance  to  antimicrobial  agents  creates  an 
extensive  trouble  in  case  of  the  management  of  intra 
and extra intestinal infections caused by E. coli, which 
are  a  major  source  of  illness,  death,  and  increased 
healthcare  costs[20].  Therefore,  the  present  study  was 
designed  to  isolate  E.  coli  strains  from  five  different 
sources  of  poultry  and  poultry  environment  of 
Bangladesh  for  assessing 
their  susceptibility  and 
resistance patterns to some selected antimicrobials. 
 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 
Sampling sites: A total of 250 samples were collected 
from  Cloacal  swabs  of  chicken,  intestinal  fluid  of 
chicken,  egg  surface,  faecal  material  of  chicken  and 
hand  wash  of  chicken  handlers  from  different  poultry 
markets in Dhaka, Bangladesh. 
 
Sampling  from  cloacal  swab:  Sterile  swab  stick 
moistened with sterile normal saline water was inserted 
in the cloacae of the chicken and placed in sterile vials. 
  
Sample collection from intestinal fluid: The intestines 
were collected just after the sacrifice of chickens. Each 
intestine  was  placed  separately  into  a  sterile  jar 
containing 500 mL of normal saline, and this suspended 
fluid of normal saline was used later for bacteriological 
analysis. 
 
Sample of egg surface: 10 eggs collected from poultry 
cases  just  after  laying  were  washed  in  1000  mL  of 
normal saline water and then taken into a sterile jar.  

Collection of sample from faecal material: About 50 
gm  of  fresh  faecal  sample  was  collected  aseptically 
from  poultry  cases  into  sterile  vials  with  the  help  of 
sterile  cotton  bud  and  5  gm  sample  was  transferred 
immediately  to  screw  caped  test  tubes  containing  10 
mL of sterile nutrient broth. 
 
Sample from hand wash of chicken handlers: Hands 
of  the  chicken  handlers  just  after  processing  of 
slaughtered  chickens  and  handling  of  chicken  for  sale 
were  washed  directly  with  1000  mL  of  normal  saline 
water and then taken into a sterile jar and sealed. 
 
Transportation  of  sample:  After  collection,  all  the 
samples were transported to the laboratory immediately 
in an insulating foam box with ice. 
 
Bacteriological  analysis:  A  loop  full  of  selective 
enriched broth from previously incubated sample from 
cloacal swab and faecal material and 0.1 mL of sample 
from intestinal fluid were spread on the solid surface of 
Eosine  Methylene  Blue  (EMB)  agar  medium  (Hi-
Media, India), 1.0 mL sample from intestinal fluid was 
placed  onto  sterile  plates  which  was  then  mixed  with 
sterile medium (EMB) poured into the plates after being 
cooled to about 42-45 oC. 10-100 mL sample from egg 
surface and hand wash of chicken handlers was filtrated 
through the membrane filter (0.45 µm, Millipore, USA) 
which  was  then  placed  on  the  surface  of  EMB  agar 
plates. All samples were incubated for 24 h at 37 oC in 
three triplications of EMB plates or filters on EMB agar 
for 
colonies. 
Identification  was  done  according  to  Buchanan  and 
Gibbons[21]  following  a  series  of  biochemical  tests 
included  gram  staining,  tests  for  oxidase,  methyl  red, 
Voges-Proskauer  reactions,  indole,  citrate,  catalase, 
urea 
lactose 
fermentation,  nitrate  reduction,  casein  hydrolysis  and 
sugar fermentation. Moreover, identification of E. coli 
was further confirmed by latex agglutination tests using 
polyvalent antisera (DENKA SEIKEN Co. Ltd, Tokyo, 
Japan). 
 
Drug  sensitivity  test: Single disc diffusion method[22] 
was  used 
to 
antimicrobial  agents.  A  total  of  13  antibiotic  discs 
(Becton  Dickinson,  U.S.A.)  with  Streptomycin  10  µg, 
Erythromycin 
30µg, 
Ciprofloxacin 5µg, Tetracycline 30µg, Penicillin 10 µg, 
Norfloxacin 10µg, Riphampicin 5µg, Neomycin 30µg, 
Cefixine 5µg, Ampicillin 10 µg, Kanamycin 20 µg and 
Gentamicin 10µg were used. By the standard method of

was  touched  with  a  sterile  loop  and  the  growth  was 
inoculated  into  2  mL  of  Mueller-Hinton  broth.  The 
broth culture was then allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 
4  hours  to  obtain  the  young  culture.  The  turbidity  of 
actively growing broth cultures was then adjusted to a 
0.5 McFarland standard and then a sterile cotton swab 
was dipped into the adjusted suspension within 15 min 
and  excess  broth  was  purged  by  pressing  and  rotating 
the swab firmly against the inside of the tube above the 
fluid level. The swab was then spread evenly over the 
entire surface of the plate of LB agar to obtain uniform 
inoculums. The plates were then allowed to dry for 3-5 
min. Antibiotics impregnated discs were then applied to 
the surface of the inoculated plates with sterile forceps. 
Each  disc  was  gently  pressed  down  onto  the  agar  to 
ensure  complete  contact  with  the  agar  surface.  Even 
distribution of discs and minimum distance of 24 mM 
from  center  to  center  were  ensured.  Five  discs  (four 
antibiotics  discs  and  one  blank  disc  as  control)  were 
placed  in  each  petri  dish.  Within  15  min  of  the 
application  of  the  discs,  the  plates  were  inverted  and 
incubated  at  37  °C.  After  16-18  h  of  incubation,  the 
plates were examined, and the diameters of the zones of 
complete  inhibition  to  the  nearest  whole  millimeter 
were  measured.  The  zone  diameter  for  individual

RESULTS 

 
Among  the  Escherichia  coli  strains  isolated  from 
 
poultry  and  poultry  environment,  a  total  of  80  were 
selected  and  subjected  to  various  morphological  and 
biochemical tests followed by serological identification. 
The  distribution  pattern  and  the  biochemical  tests  for 
identification  of  E.  coli  isolates  from  poultry  sources 
are summarized in Table 1 and 2, respectively. 58 % of 
total samples were found E. coli positive. The incidence 
range of all 5 types of sample sources found was from 
42 % in egg surfaces to 82 % in feces. 
Antibiotic  susceptibility  pattern  of E.  coli  isolates 
 
from  samples  of  poultry  sources  has  been  outlined  in 
Table  3.  Resistance  spectrum  of  E.  coli  for  13 
antibiotics tested in descending order was respectively 
Penicillin,  Ciprofloxacin,  Riphampicin,  Kanamycin, 
Streptomycin,  Cefixine,  Erythromycin,  Ampicillin, 
Tetracycline,  and  Chloramphenicol  and  Neomycin, 
with  ranges  of  percent  strains  resistant  from  20  %  in 
case of neomycin and 88 % for penicillin (Table 3). No 
strain was found either sensitive to erythromycin,

processed cheap fish wastes were found to be important 
causes  for  bacterial  contamination  of  poultry  feeds[24]. 
E.  coli  was  reported  as  a  common  microflora  in  raw 
feeding  materials  and  poultry  feeds[25].  Present  study 
showed a high percentage of egg surface samples 42 % 
contained  E.  coli.  The  pre-stuffed  chickens  in  poultry 
shops,  poultry  and  poultry  products  like  eggs  and 
plastic-wrapped poultry meat in various super shops get 
contaminated  easily  by  E.  coli  for 
the  careless 
unhygienic  handling  process  and  ready-to-eat  foods 
become cross contaminated with E. coli as well as other 
pathogenic  bacteria  from  food  handlers  with  poor 
personal hygiene and from other raw poultry products. 
Resistance  of  E.  coli  isolates  from  Malaysian  broiler 
chicken to ampicillin, tetracycline and gentamicin with 
11-95 %  range  has been  reported[26].  Rahman et  al.[23] 
reported E. coli isolates from broiler and layer poultry 
in Bangladesh were found resistant to chloramphenicol, 
ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline and streptomycin 
in  37-87.5  %  cases;  and  50-66.6  %  strains  highly 
sensitive to chloramphenicol and gentamicin. 66-100 % 
E.  coli  strains  from  poultry  in  Bangladesh  showed 
resistance  to  tetracycline,  penicillin,  erythromycin  and 
chloramphenicol[27].  Tricia  et  al.[28]  reported  43  % 
isolates  of  E.  coli  were  resistant  to  ampicillin  but  no 
isolate  was  found  resistant  to  gentamicin,  which  is  in 
agreement  with 
this  present  study.  Daini  and 
Adesemowo[29]  found  the  resistance  of  E.  coli  from 
Nigeria in 54 and 88 % strains against gentamicin and 
tetracycline respectively. 
 
All the isolates of present study exhibited multiple 
resistances to more than six antibiotics. Similar findings 
on multiple drug resistance of E. coli strains has been 
reported  from  Bangladesh  and  other  parts  of  the 
world[23,30-32].  Due  to  indiscriminate  exploitation  of

CONCLUSION 

 
Risk assessment should reflect the increasing weight of 
scientific  evidence  indicating  the  potential  for  even 
transferring  genetic 
non-pathogens  carrying  and 
determinants  for  antibiotics  resistance 
to  human 
pathogens, cross-resistance development, and potential 
link between resistance to critical antibiotics in human 
medicine  and  use  of  similar  drugs  in  poultry  feeds. 
Appropriate  use  of  antibiotics  in  humans  and  farm 
animals needs to be addressed in Bangladesh and other 
countries.
