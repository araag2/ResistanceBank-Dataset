ABSTRACT
The emergence of antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli, especially extendedâ€“spectrum b-lactamase
(ESBL)â€“producing strains,
in the intestinal tract of broilers could be a threat to poultry and
human. We investigated changes of antimicrobial resistance patterns and frequency of ESBL
genes among faecal E. coli isolates of broilers and workers in five different farms during two
rearing periods in Iran. In this regard, E. coli was isolated from rectal swabs of the workers and
cloacal swabs of the broilers. After detection of antibiotic resistance patterns, phenotypic and
genotypic characterisation of ESBL phenotype in these strains, carriage of the resistance genes
on their crude plasmid extracts and diversity of plasmid profiles were analysed. Accordingly, mul-
tidrug-resistant (MDR) patterns were detected in a high percentage of E. coli strains from the
workers (72.7%) and poultry (92.3%). ESBL-producing E. coli strains were identified in these farms
throughout the two periods of rearing (6.3%). blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-61, blaTEM-116 and blaTEM-1 were
characterised in 6 (Period I/II: 4/2), 1 (Period I), 2 (Period II) and 9 (Period I/II: 5/4) strains, respect-
ively. The first isolation of E. coli strains harbouring the blaTEM116 gene in chicken is reported in
this study. In conclusion, results of this study showed that chickens could serve as a reservoir for
ESBL-producing E. coli strains. These strains could carry clinically important ESBL or new emerg-
ing b-lactamases genes. Early colonisation and selection of the resistant strains during rearing
periods proposed illegal use of antimicrobials as the cause of change in resistance patterns in
the studied farms.

Introduction

Escherichia coli, as part of the intestinal microbiota, is
one of the most important and common bacterial
agents responsible for different intestinal or extra-intes-
tinal infections in human and animal populations (Miles
et al. 2006). These infections are treated by common
antibiotics; however, treatment failure can be caused,
which result in increased treatment costs and mortality
(Nunan and Young 2012). Uncontrolled prescription of
antibiotics in veterinary medicine provides a selective
pressure for emergence of resistance E. coli strains not
only among its known pathotypes, but also among the
commensal strains (Miles et al. 2006). Antibiotics are

used in food animals for control of bacterial infections
and are continuously fed to their foods as antimicrobial
growth promoters. Because of their roles in dissemin-
ation of resistance gene markers in the community, the
existence of the resistant commensal strains in the
gastrointestinal tract of food animals acts as a threat to
public health (Nunan and Young 2012). Integrated sur-
veillance study is necessary to track their development
in food animals and their products.

The broilers intestinal tract can colonise with E. coli
strains presenting resistance phenotypes related to
extended spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs), which their
emergence is a cause of concern in countries with

farms
(Engberg et al. 2000; Diarrassouba et al. 2007;
Karczmarczyk et al. 2011). These strains may develop
temporary during the breeding or growth, spread
among the commensal strains through transferrable
genetic elements, and persist in a poultry house long
time. Workers of poultry house who are in direct con-

from animals and humans. Although some studies
rejected this association,
resistant
E. coli strains and their plasmids from avian to human
community was established in a study in Netherlands
(van den Bogaard et al. 2001). In other studies, the col-
onisation of the human intestinal tract with resistant
E. coli strains from chicken and spread of their anti-
biotic resistance plasmids were described (Cooke et al.
1971; Levy et al. 1976). Caya et al. (1999) and Kariuki
et al. (1997) refused this association through compar-
ing the phenotypes and genotypes of E. coli
isolates
from chickens and humans. To establish likelihood of
this association, changes of resistance patterns along
different time scales should be monitored in defined
human and animal populations.

In the current study, possible changes of antimicro-
bial susceptibility patterns of faecal E. coli isolates and
emergence of the ESBL-producing strains were investi-
gated during the first week following entry of the
chickens to the farms and the last week of a rearing
period before slaughtering in five different poultry
houses. The results were compared with the workers
faecal isolates in the same farms, similarly.

Materials and methods

Bacterial isolates

A total of 471 cloacal swab samples from broilers and
24 rectal swabs from workers of five different poultry
houses were collected over a six-month period in 2013
in Tehran,
Iran. To study changes of the colonising
intestinal E. coli during the breeding, we obtained the
samples at two separate periods of growing up. The
sampling from chickens less than a week comprised
period I and samples taken from broilers a few days
before slaughtering (6 weeks olds chicken) were con-
sidered as period II. The exact time of sampling and
the number of poultry samples collected during each
rearing period are shown in Supplementary material
(Table A). The samples were collected from different
broilers during the rearing periods. The sampling of
workers was conducted in two periods to coincide

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by the
standard disk diffusion assay (Kirby- Bauer method) on
Muellerâ€“Hinton agar plates (Merck, Germany), using
overnight cultures at a 0.5 McFarland standard fol-
lowed by incubation at 37
C for 16 to 18 h.
Interpretation was done according to the latest CLSI
guidelines (CLSI 2012). Antibiotic susceptibility was
studied against
ciprofloxacin
(5 mg), chloramphenicol (30 mg), ampicillin (10 mg), gen-
tamicine (10 mg), cefepime (30 lg), ceftazidime (30 lg),
cephalotin (30 lg), cefalexin (30 lg), cefoxitin (30 lg),
ceftriaxon (30 lg) and meropenem (10 lg) (PadtanTeb,
Iran). Resistance phenotypes related to ESBLs were
detected by performing confirmatory tests in the cases

the experiments. Multidrug-resistance
(MDR) and pandrug resistance (PDR) phenotypes were
defined based on Magiorakos et al. (2012) guideline
for the members of Enterobacteriaceae. MDR E. coli
was defined as non-susceptibility to at least one agent
in three or more antimicrobial categories (Magiorakos

terns of the plasmids were analysed in 0.8% agarose
gel after electrophoresis and staining under ultraviolet
light using an ultraviolet transilluminator.

PCR amplification and sequencing of ESBLs genes
in Escherichia coli strains

The presence of blaTEM, blaSHV and blaCTX-M genes
was investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
on plasmid extracts of
the ESBL-producing strains
(Hu et al. 2006). PCR primer sequences and condi-
tions used in this study were shown in Table 1. All
PCR amplicons were analysed by gel electrophoresis
on 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel and stained with eth-
idium bromide (0.5 mg/ml). To verify the detected
genes in E. coli strains and characterise their types,
related PCR products were subjected to bidirectional
sequencing (Viragene Co.,
Iran) using the same pri-
their amplification. The nucleotide
mers used for
sequences obtained from various
isolates were
reference
assembled and aligned with GenBank
sequences using the ClustalW application.
The
sequences were submitted to GenBank and accession
numbers were obtained.
Translated amino acid
sequences were compared with published sequences
in the Lahey organisation (http://www.lahey.org/stud-
ies) and types of the ESBLs were determined based
on defined amino acid changes.

Statistical analysis

Significant
relationship between the resistance pat-
terns of avian E. coli and workersâ€™ strains was inves-
tigated using GraphPad Quick
(GraphPad
Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). NTSYS software
(version 2.0) was used for comparison of phenetic
data (resistance patterns) of the strains in each and
among separate poultry houses.

Results

Phenotypic characterisation of antimicrobial
resistance

Out of the 495 collected samples obtained from farms
A-D (located in the East of Tehran) and farm E (located
in the south-east of Tehran), nearly 94% of the sam-
ples showed positive culture results for E. coli (workers,
91.6% [22/24] and poultry farms, 94% [444/471]). Most
of the isolates was related to lactose-positive E. coli
strains (98.7%). Different rates of resistance to antibiot-
ics were detected. Table 2 represents diversity and fre-
quency of antimicrobial resistance among the E. coli
strains in the poultry and workers. Related MDR pat-
terns of the workers and poultry strains that were
detected in the two growth periods were shown in
Table 3. Nearly, 3.2% (15/466) and 0.4% (2/466) of the
strains
showed possible extensively drug-resistant
(XDR) and possible pandrug-resistant
(PDR) pheno-
types, respectively. E. coli strains that were isolated
from the second period showed a significant increase
in the frequency of 5MDR pattern (p valueÂ¼ .007),
while the frequency of 3MDR pattern was significantly
decreased (p valueÂ¼ .004). The strains depicted triple
to septate MDR patterns in both periods of growing
up in all the poultry houses. The strains with eight and
nine MDR patterns were detected only in the second
period of growing up in the poultry houses C, D and
E. These results showed high frequency of MDR pat-
terns in the workers (72.7%; 16/22) and the broilers
(92.5%; 411/444). While,
triple and quadruple drug
resistance patterns were mainly observed among the
workersâ€™ strains, resistance to higher numbers of the
antibiotic categories (five to nine antibiotics) was
detected in the avian strains (Table 2). The emergence
of new resistance patterns was also detected in the
second rearing period in all the studied farms.

As was shown in Figure 1, resistance to tetracyc-
line (90.8%) and cefepime (0.2%) was detected as the
highest

these farms
showed no significant difference in the rates of resist-
ance to antibiotics tetracycline (76.1â€“96.2%), ampicillin
(60â€“88.7%), chloramphenicol (56.5â€“87.5%), and cipro-
floxacin (51â€“74.2%). However, in the cases of antibiot-
ics,
cephalothin
(52.2% vs. 1.4â€“20.8%), cefoxitin (50% vs. 1.4â€“20.8%)
and ceftriaxon (47.8% vs. 1.4â€“20.8%), these analyses
showed significant increases in rates of the resistance
in farm B compared to the other
farms (p val-
ue.0001). Resistance to gentamicin, as an aminogly-
coside, was determined as 30.4%. Resistance to
meropenem was only detected among the strains
that were isolated from farm E (68.6%). In contrast to
farms A, C and E, farms B and D showed increased
rates of resistance to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd generation
cephalosporins. Among the workersâ€™ strains, rates of
resistance to meropenem, chloramphenicol, cipro-
floxacin,
ceftazidim
showed significant differences compared with those
the workersâ€™
from the poultry. Although most of
strains presented lower percentages of resistance to
these antibiotics, higher rates of resistance to mero-
penem and ampicillin were observed in these strains.
Analysis of
the resistance patterns between the
poultry strains, which were isolated during the first
(Period I, one-week old) and second (Period II, over
6-week old) rearing periods, showed increased rates
of resistance to most antimicrobial families,
including
tetracyclines, phenicols, aminoglycosides,
penicillins,
and quinolones. TEÃ¾ PENÃ¾ PHEÃ¾ FQ was the most
common MDR pattern in the poultry strains, which
also detected in the workersâ€™

Detection of ESBL genetic determinants

isolates (6.3%)

ESBL-encoding E. coli strains were characterised in the
broilersâ€™
in both two rearing periods
(Period I, 4.6% [8/174] and Period II, 7.4%, [20/270]).
This phenotype was not characterised in the workersâ€™
samples. Farm D showed relatively higher contamin-
ation rate with the strains presenting ESBL phenotype
(39.3%, 11/28) compared with the other ones, includ-
ing farm B (21.4%, 6/28), farms A, C (14.3%, 4/28,
in
each case) and E (10.7%, 3/28). Resistance to five or
greater antimicrobial categories was observed mainly
among the
strains presenting ESBL phenotype
(Table 2). While 12 out of 28 E. coli strains that showed
ESBL phenotype (42.8%) carried blaTEM or blaCTX-M,
transfer of these genetic determinants was not estab-
lished among the remaining 16 strains. The character-
ised b-lactamases were included blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-61,
blaTEM-116 and blaTEM-1, detected in 6 (Period I/II: 4/2),
1 (Period I), 2 (Period II) and 9 (Period I/II: 5/4)
strains, respectively. While co-carriage of blaCTX-M-1 or
blaCTX-M-61 with blaTEM-1 was detected among six strains
(Period I/II: 4/2), blaSHV was not detected in the studied
E. coli strains in these flocks. Following accession num-
bers were obtained for these b-lactamases: KP308218.1,
KP308219.1, KP634884, KP634886, KP634888, KP634894,

Similarity of Plasmid profiles in ESBL-producing
E. coli strains

The same plasmid patterns were detected among
some of the ESBL-encoding strains in each poultry
house that was different from those from other farms.

Percentages of the resistance to each antibiotic. All the results were presented based on criteria for disk diffusion method accord-
ing to the CLSI guidelines.

Gel electrophoresis of the plasmids showed carriage of
low- and high-molecular weight plasmids in these
strains (Figure A, Supplementary material). Similarity of
the plasmid patterns was observed among the strains
in farms C and D, individually. Comparison of the plas-
mid patterns among the strains collected from differ-
ent poultry houses showed a similar pattern in two
strains isolated from farms C and D; however, the pat-
tern was not identical.

Comparison of antimicrobial resistance patterns

Biotyping of the strains subjected to antibiotic suscep-
tibility testing was performed according to their resist-
ance profiles based on a distance cut-off point of
100%. E. coli strains of farm E, which was located in
the south-east of Tehran showed greatest diversity of
resistance patterns compared with the other farms
located in the East of Tehran. The most similar resist-
ance patterns were observed among the strains col-
lected from farms A and C. Analysis of the obtained
clusters in all the poultry houses showed a correlation
between the resistance patterns and the sampling

collected strains

time. Accordingly, strains that were obtained from
Period I or II of the rearing were mostly clustered with
the other strains from the same sampling period in
other farms. This similarity was also observed among
the
from each poultry house
(Figure B, Supplementary material). However, coexist-
ence of the strains obtained from different sampling
times was observed in few clusters. Similarity of the
resistance patterns between the workers and chickens
the 22 workersâ€™
strains was detected in 5 out of
strains, which was not statistically significant. Cross
contamination of chickens and workers was postulated
just in one poultry house (farm E), so that the strains
were imipenem resistant and showed similar resistance
patterns (Figure B, Supplementary material).

Discussion

Surveillance studies could provide valuable informa-
tion about antimicrobial
resistance rates in E. coli
strains and risk of their transmission. In this study, we
examined resistance patterns of collected E. coli strains
from faecal samples of broiler chickens and workers

Downloaded by [RMIT University Library] at 00:44 23 December 2017 related to their farms. The strains were highly resist-
ance to tetracycline, ampicillin, chloramphenicol and
ciprofloxacin. This finding is consistent with a previous
study from Iran that reported increased rates of resist-
ance to tetracycline and chloramphenicol among the
strains isolated from the broilers (Rafiei Tabatabaei and
Nasirian 2003). The use of oxytetracyclin (a member of
tetracyclines) as a feed additive for growth promotion
and prevention of diseases is common in the broiler
rearing in Iran (Salehzadeh et al. 2006). Therefore,
cross-resistance due to the use of this agent possibility
was the cause of increase in the resistance to tetracyc-
line in the studied farms. Usage of fluoroquinolones in
veterinary medicine is considered as a concern for the
treatment of serious infections in human medicine
(Van et al. 2008). Administration of Fluoroquinolones
(enrofloxacine)
in the studied farms was postulated
according to our results, since significant increase in
the rate of resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed at
second period of rearing. Resistance to ciprofloxacin in
our strains was higher
than those reported from
European countries (Boerlin et al. 2005). In the case of
chloramphenicol, despite its banned use in Iran, high
rates of resistance to this antibiotic were detected in
all the poultry houses. The presence of chlorampheni-
col resistance phenotype in E. coli strains was reported
by earlier studies in Iran (White et al. 2000). The high
rate of resistance could be explained by the usage of
florfenicol in these farms. Resistance to this antibiotic
is in accordance with resistance to chloramphenicol,
which is mediated by a plasmid encoded gene,
flo
(Keyes et al. 2000).
In a report from Pan-European
monitoring surveillance study, 13.3% of the chicken
strains showed resistance to this antibiotic, which was
higher
than those reported from United States of
America (0.6%). Selection of the resistant strains with
unrelated antimicrobials was proposed in this report
to explain higher level of resistance to this antibiotic
in the E. coli strains in Europe (Abbott et al. 2011).

Similar to our results,

increase in the numbers of
resistance phenotypes during the growth of the chick-
ens and change in faecal microbiome was established
by Ozaki et al. (2011). These authors showed that the
change can occur even in the absence of antimicrobial
administration.

The lowest rate of resistance was related to broad
spectrum cephalosporins in the studied poultry houses
(0.2â€“12%). This finding was in accordance with those
reported by de Jong et al.
in Europe. The
increased administration of extended-spectrum b-lac-
two decades
tams in food animals over
resulted in the emergence of
resistance strains to
these antibiotics (Szmolka and Nagy 2013). While low

rate of the strains presenting ESBL phenotype was

these farms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
that described this emergence in Iran.
first
Girlich et al.
(2007) detected a frequency of 10.7%
ESBL-encoding E. coli strains from healthy poultry in
France in 2005 and suggested food animals as a pos-
sible reservoir for ESBL genes. Colonization of ESBL-
producing bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract of food
animals may contribute to the increased incidence of
infection with these bacteria in human populations
(Hall et al. 2011). However, this correlation was not the
case in our study, since no E. coli strains presenting
ESBL phenotype was isolated from faecal samples of
the workers. Our findings demonstrated blaCTX-M-1 as
the most common type of ESBLs in the chicken iso-
lates. This beta lactamase was detected as the most
common blaESBL genes among Enterobacteriacea in
Europe and Asia (Bonnet 2004). Local studies in Iran
reported CTX-M as the most dominant ESBL in E. coli
strains from clinical samples (Ramazanzadeh 2010).
Mirzaee et al. (2009) reported dominance of blaCTX-M
group 1 as common CTX-M b-lactamase genes among
E. coli strains isolated from hospitalised patients in
Iran, which was similar
to those reported in the
Switzerland, France and Austria. CTX-M-61 is rarely
found in Enterobacteriaceae and its detection in E. coli
strains is scant. The presence of blaCTX-M-1/-61 in poultry
and farm workers was proposed in a recent study in
Germany. However, differentioation of
these two
enzymes was not verified (Dahms et al. 2015). The first
isolation of TEM-116 ESBL-encoding strains in chicken
was referred to a Shigella flexneri isolate in China (Hu
et al. 2008). Isolation of E. coli strains carrying blaTEM-
116 was also described in clinical samples (Fernandes
et al. 2014); however, according to our knowledge,
there is no report about its isolation from the chicken.
The absence of the examined ESBL-encoding genes
among the remaining E. coli strains that presented
ESBL resistance phenotype, proposed the presence of
other ESBLs genes,
including blaPER, blaVEB, blaBEL-1,
blaBES-1, blaSFO-1, blaTLA-1 and blaTLA-2, which needs fur-
ther studies.

In our study, the observed resistance to merope-
nem was surprising, although the rate was low similar
to the other reports from European, American and
Asian countries (Sosa et al. 2010; Aly et al. 2012; Cho
et al. 2012). There are no previous reports of the pres-
ence of this resistance phenotype in E. coli strains
from poultry in Iran. In the current study, resistance to
meropenem was only detected in farm E, which was
in association to its presence in the workers faecal
samples in this farm. This farm was located in distinct

geographic location where other farms were placed.
This difference shows the importance of the control
on all animal food production sectors. Analysis of the
antibiotic susceptibility patterns showed the same
resistance phenotype for
the imipenem resistant
strains.

Resistance to multiple antibiotic

families was
detected in the studied farms in Iran. In the Europe,
lower rate of MDR patterns (31.1%) was reported by the
European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and European
Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in E.
coli strains from broilers in 2012 (EFSA 2014). However,
most of the strains in our study showed multi-drug
resistant patterns (87.7%, Period I and 95%, Period II)
that were similar to those reported previously (Van et al.
2008). Although, results of our study showed influence
of antimicrobials on selection of the resistant E. coli
strains, isolation of the MDR strains in Period I of their
rearing proposed their early contamination in related
hatcheries. As was shown by Torok et al. (2011), the use
of antimicrobials in hatcheries promotes the selection of
resistance strains during the first week of life (7 days)
in both broilers and layers. In addition to the increased
consumption of antibiotics, overcrowding and poor
sanitation seems to be the possible reason for develop-
ing and spreading of the MDR strains in the studied
poultry houses. The most frequent MDR pattern in these
farms was TEÃ¾ PENÃ¾ PHEÃ¾ FQ, which was in accord-
ance with the most common MDR patterns in Europe
(TEÃ¾ PENÃ¾ FQ) and America (TEÃ¾ PENÃ¾ PHE). These
MDR patterns were also reported by another study
(Tadesse et al. 2012). Transmission of the resistant
strains between the poultry and farmers was not con-
firmed in this study, since different patterns of antibiotic
resistance (except farm E) were characterised in the
workers compared with the broiler chickens during the
two rearing periods. However, as a main limitation, in
this study, we just analysed the workers who were in
direct contact with the chickens in each farm. To find a
better relationship, workers of slaughterhouses and con-
sumers in the community also need to be followed.
Dissemination of E. coli strains from poultry to farmers
was established in a study in the Netherlands (van den
Bogaard et al. 2001). These strains conferred high rate of
resistance to amoxicillin and tetracycline and showed
the same pulsotype. The observed changes of MDR pat-
terns between the two rearing periods and the emer-
gence of possible PDR strains (resistance to nine
antimicrobial families)
in current study was similarly
determined in a study by da Costa et al. (2009). They
explained this shift of resistance profile by capacity of E.
coli strains for genetic exchange of resistance genes and
change in their community structure under the selective

pressure of antibiotics. Existence of various plasmids
was revealed in these strains by plasmid profiling, which
proposed their association with the acquisition of new
resistance phenotypes. This association was supported
by the detection of the same plasmid profiles among
the strains collected from each poultry house. However,
no similar plasmid pattern was observed in the strains
of distinct farms. Horizontal transmission of the same
plasmid harbouring an ESBL gene among different E.
coli strains was indicated by this study, which proposed
the existence of a common source of transmission in
some studied poultry houses. This transmission could
result in some selective conditions, since most of the
strains that conferred ESBL phenotype were obtained
from the second study period. More investigation is
needed to establish this association in these farms.

Conclusions

In conclusion, results of the present study highlighted
the emergence and enrichment of MDR phenotypes
among E. coli
isolates in the gut of healthy broiler
chickens and workers of different poultry houses dur-
ing the rearing periods in Iran. Resistance to five and
greater antimicrobial
in these flocks was
mainly associated with infection of ESBL-producing
strains (blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-61, blaTEM-116). Similarity of
plasmid profiles among the ESBL strains in each farm
and carriage of the genes on plasmid extracts, pro-
posed plasmids as main vehicle of these genetic ele-
ments among these strains. While comparison of
resistance phenotypes verified correlation of E. coli
strains between the broilers and workers in one farm,
administration
especially
Fluoroquinolones and Phenicols, was postulated as
main reason for changes of resistance phenotypes in
these farms at the second rearing period. Programs for
monitoring antimicrobial use in hatcheries and poultry
houses are necessary to control the emergence of
resistant E. coli strains in broilersâ€™ farms and prevent
their transmission to human population.
