ABSTRACT
Objective: The present study aimed to determine the frequency and antimicrobial profile of ESBL-producing 
isolates of E. coli in different environments.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at The Children’s Hospital and The Institute of Child 
Health,  Lahore  from  July  to  December  2015.  The  faecal  specimens  from  healthy  individuals,  patients, 
sewage sludge, cattle, chickens and raw meat (n = 122) were processed for microbiological analysis using 
MacConkey agar supplemented with cefotaxime. The identification of organisms was confirmed by API 10S 
and antimicrobial resistance profile was recorded by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method.
Results: On the basis of screening, 77 (63.0%) specimens were found to be positive for ESBL production. 
The confirmation of 74 (60.0%) ESBL producing E. coli was done using double disc synergy test (DDST). 
The frequency of ESBL producing E. coli was found to be 17 (57.0%) in healthy individuals, 15 (53.0%) in 
patients, 10 (66.0%) in cattle faeces, 5 (71.0%) in sewage sludge, 14 (70.0%) in raw meat and 13 (59.0%) 
in chicken faeces. All of these isolates were resistant to cephalosporins and some of these were resistant 
to fluoroquinolones and meropenem. None of the isolates showed resistance to cefoperazone-sulbactam, 
imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and amikacin.
Conclusion: The prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli was recorded in all the environments, suggesting a 
global expansion of these enzymes.

organisms. Most strains of E. coli are not supposed 
to cause any harm but some serotypes of E. coli are 
harmful and can cause pathology.1 Virulent strains 
of E. coli can cause various diseases in humans and 
animals.  In  humans  it  can  cause  gastroenteritis, 
urinary tract infections, food poisoning, haemolytic-
uremic syndrome, peritonitis mastitis, septicaemia, 
pneumonia,  diarrhoea  and  neonatal  meningitis.2 
The main passage of transmission of E. coli infections 
is  faecal-oral  route.  During  slaughter  and  carcass 
processing, the shedding of E. coli could prove to be 
the important source of contamination.3 It can also 
be transmitted by food and travelling.4 The humans 
colonised with ESBL-producing E. coli can release

large  quantities  of  bacteria  into  the  environment 
which  will  then  enter  the  transmission  cycle 
through sewage, water and soil.5 ESBL-producing 
E. coli are resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins but 
are susceptible to cephamycins and carbapenems.6 
  High  levels  of  resistance  among  the  clinical 
isolates  have  come  up  to  the  alarming  situation 
which is due to the inefficiency in ESBL detection. 
In many hospital settings there are no proper testing 
protocols for the testing of ESBL. This insufficiency 
has lead to the increased spread of resistant strains. 
The  laboratory  settings  should  become  capable 
enough in order to detect ESBL isolates on routine 
basis so that proper therapy can be given to avoid 
overuse of antibiotics.7
  Phenotypic  detection  of  ESBLs  can  be  done  by 
direct  screening  of  clinical  samples  or  screening 
by  disc  diffusion  method.  Double  disc  synergy 
test  (DDST)  and  Combined  disc  tests  (CDT) 
are  commonly  used  methods.8  There  are  only 
few  studies  published  in  Pakistan  about  the 
dissemination of ESBL-producing E. coli in different 
environments:  healthy 
individuals,  patients, 
sewage  sludge,  cattle,  chickens  and  raw  meat. 
Our study aimed to determine the frequency and 
antimicrobial profile of ESBL-producing isolates of 
E. coli in different environments. The study will also 
focus on the techniques used to characterise these 
superbugs from animals and birds faeces.

METHODS

  This cross-sectional study was conducted at The 
Children’s Hospital and The Institute of Child Health, 
Lahore  from  July  to  December  2015.  The  study 
was  ethically  approved  by  the  ethical  committee 
of  The  Children’s  Hospital  and  The  Institute  of 
Child  Health,  Lahore.  E.  coli  were  isolated  from 
faecal  specimens  of  healthy  individuals,  patients, 
sewage sludge, cattle, chickens and raw meat. All 
the specimens were inoculated on the MacConkey 
agar  medium  containing  2mg/L  cefotaxime.  The 
specimens  from  healthy  individuals  were  directly 
inoculated on the media. The floor samples (10g) of 
faeces from animals were homogenized in 5mL of 
peptone water. Aliquots of 0.1 mL were inoculated 
on  the  media.  The  raw  meat  was  collected  from 
various butcher shops of Lahore city. A swab was 
moistened with the peptone water and was rubbed 
on the meat surface firmly. Another dry swab was 
taken and rubbed over the same surface. Both the 
swabs  were  introduced  into  the  bottle  containing 
3-4 glass beads and an appropriate known volume 
of  diluents  (0.1%  peptone,  0.9%  NaCl)  and  were 

ESBL-producing E. coli from human and animals

shaken  vigorously.  Aliquots  were  inoculated  on 
the  above  mentioned  media.  The  sludge  samples 
(1  mL)  were  inoculated  in  2  mL  of  Brain  Heart 
Infusion (BHI) broth which contained cefotaxime (2 
mg/L) and then the sample was incubated at 37◦C 
for two hours under aerobic conditions. After the 
pre-enrichment  procedure,  2  mL  from  each  tube 
was inoculated in 10 mL of Brain Heart Infusion-
Cefotaxime  (BHI-CTX)  broth.  Tubes  were  further 
incubated  for  18  hours  at  37◦C  under  anaerobic 
conditions  to  avoid  overgrowth  of  aerobic  Gram-
negative bacteria. Each culture was diluted 10 fold 
with  Ringer  solution  and  0.1  mL  of  each  dilution 
was  inoculated  on  MacConkey  agar  containing 
2mg/L  cefotaxime.  All  the  plates  were  incubated 
at 37◦C for 48 hours.9 Identification of bacteria was 
performed  by  using  colony  morphology,  routine 
biochemical test and API 10S.
  Detection  of  ESBL  production  was  confirmed 
by  the  Double  Disc  Synergy  Test  (DDST).  In  this 
process  disc  containing  co-amoxiclav  was  placed 
at the centre of the plate and cephalosporins were 
applied edge to edge at the distance of 15mm from 
the  centre  disc.  Positive  results  were  indicated 
when  the  inhibition  zones  around  any  of  the 
cephalosporin discs augmented in the direction of 
the disc containing clavulanic acid.10
  Antimicrobial  sensitivity  testing  was  performed 
by  using  modified  Kirby-Bauer  disc  diffusion 
technique. An inoculum was prepared according to 
the McFarland 0.5 turbidity standard and streaked 
with a swab on Mueller Hinton agar plate. Various 
antibiotic  discs  such  as  amikacin,  amoxicillin, 
cefixime,  cefotaxime,  ceftazidime,  ceftriaxone, 
cefuroxime, 
ciprofloxacin, 
fosfomycin, moxifloxacin, cefoperazone-sulbactam, 
piperacillin-tazobactam,  imipenem,  meropenem, 
were  used  for  the  antimicrobial  susceptibility 
testing and results were observed after 16-18 hours 
of  incubation  at  37◦C.11  American  type  culture 
collection  (ATCC)  strains  were  used  as  controls 
in  this  study.  Klebsiella  pneumoniae  ATCC,  700603 
(ESBL-producing isolate) and E. coli ATCC, 25922 
(non-ESBL)  were  used  as  positive  and  negative 
controls for ESBL production, respectively.12

analysis.  Among  these  samples  initial  screening 
showed  positivity  in  77  (63.0%)  samples.  The 
confirmation  of  ESBL-producing  E.  coli  was  done 
using  DDST  which  showed  74  (60.0%)  isolates  as 
ESBL-producers and three isolates of AmpC beta-
lactamases  producers  which  were  excluded  from 
study.  The  frequency  of  ESBL-producing  E.  coli 
was found to be 15 (53.0%) in patients, 17 (57.0%) 
in  healthy  individuals,  10  (66.0%)  in  cattle  faeces,

antibiotics.  All  of  the  confirmed  ESBL-producing 
isolates  were  resistant  to  ceftazidime,  ceftriaxone, 
cefotaxime,  cefuroxime  and  co-amoxiclav.  There 
were 30 (40.0%) isolates which showed resistance to

DISCUSSION
  The  present  study  aimed 
the 
frequency  of  ESBL-producing  E.  coli  in  different 
environments which could be an important source 
of  dissemination.  In  our  study  the  frequency  of 
ESBL-producing E. coli in patients was 15 (53.0%) 
and 17 (57.0%) among healthy individuals. In Spain 
a  research  was  done  on  the  detection  of  ESBL-
producing  strains  in  different  environment.  The 
frequency  of  ESBL-producing  E.  coli  was  6.6%  in 
the patients’ stool samples.9 Another research done 
in  medical  University  of  Graz,  Austria  reported 
4% increased prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli 
from  2000  to  2009.13  ESBL-producing  E.  coli  had 
41% prevalence rate from a tertiary care hospital of 
Pakistan.14 A study conducted in Thailand on faecal 
specimens  from  the  healthy  individuals  reported 
that majority of the isolates were ESBL-producing 
E.  coli  (85.1%).15  ESBL-producing  E.  coli  were  the 
predominant isolate from the three rural provinces 
of  Thailand  where  the  prevalence  came  out  to  be 
90%, 90%, and 89%, respectively.16 In 2012, healthy 
individuals who visited the Parisian checkup centre 
participated and provided the stool samples. Out of 
345  subjects,  21  (6.0%)  were  the  ESBL-producing 
E.  coli.17  The  frequency  of  ESBL-producing  E. 
coli  in  these  studies  is  variable.  The  prevalence 
of  ESBL-producing  E.  coli  was  low  in  developed 
countries like Spain and Austria while it was high 
in developing countries like Pakistan and Thailand.
  In  the  present  study  the  prevalence  of  ESBL-
producing  E.  coli 
in  sludge  samples  was  5 
(71.0%).  A  study  conducted  for  the  detection  of 
ESBL-producing  Enterobacteriaceae  from  various 
environments in Spain reported 100% prevalence of 
ESBL-producing E. coli from the 5 samples of sewage

sludge. All the sludge samples were taken from the 
treatment  plants  of  influent  raw  urban  sewage.9 
Only  0.5%  ESBL-producing  E.  coli  were  isolated 
from sludge samples from 2000 to 2009 in a study 
conducted in Medical university of Graz, Austria. 
The samples were taken only from those treatment 
plants which did not receive any wastewater from 
hospitals.13  ESBL-producing  E.  coli  in  cattle  faecal 
samples were 10 (66.0%) in our study. A research 
was  done  in  Mecklenburg-Western  Pomerania, 
Germany  detected  54.5%  ESBL-producing  E.  coli 
in  livestock  cattle.18  Another  study  conducted  on 
Bavarian  dairy  and  beef  cattle  farms  reported  the 
prevalence of 38.0% ESBL-producing E. coli.19 These 
results are similar to the results of our study.
  The  prevalence  of  ESBL-producing  E.  coli  in 
chicken faecal samples in ourstudy was 13 (59.0%). 
A research done in Spain reported 100% prevalence 
of  ESBL-producing 
in  chicken  floor 
faecal  samples.8  In  another  research  conducted 
in  Germany,  72.5%  of  prevalence  rate  of  ESBL-
producing E. coli was found in chicken faecal floor 
samples.20 In current study the E. coli were isolated 
from all of the 20 samples of raw meat and there 
were 14 (70%) ESBL-producing E. coli. The samples 
of raw meat were taken right after their collection 
from the butcher shops. They were not processed 
with  any  cleaning  agent  before  the  culturing  so 
that  we  could  see  if  the  animal  was  slaughtered 
and treated under hygienic conditions or not. High 
prevalence  of  E.  coli  depicts  the  unhygienic  ways 
of  handling  the  meat.  A  research  conducted  in 
Netherland  for  the  detection  of  ESBL-producing 
E.  coli  reported  prevalence  of  79.8%  in  chicken 
raw  meat  samples.21  Another  study  conducted 
in  Germany  reported  the  prevalence  of  88.6%  in 
raw meat samples.20 The above results of different 
studies are in accordance with our study result.
  All  the  ESBL-producing  E.  coli  was  resistant 
cephalosporins  and  co-amoxiclav  in  our  study.  A 
study from Germany also reported high resistance to 
ESBL-producing E. coli to the cefixime, cefuroxime, 
cefotaxime, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.20 Majority 
of the ESBL-producing E. coli in our study presented 
with  good 
sensitivity  against  cefoperazone-
sulbactam, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and 
amikacin.  A  research  done  on  Parisian  checkup 
centre  showed  the  sensitivity  pattern  in  which 
none  of  the  ESBL-producing  E.  coli  isolate  was 
resistant  to  piperacillin-tazobactam,  imipenem  or 
amikacin.17  The  prevalence  of  ESBL-producing  E. 
coli was notable in all the environments studied in 
our research, suggesting a global expansion of these 

ESBL-producing E. coli from human and animals

enzymes to make them superbugs. This prevalence 
is likely to increase among humans worldwide in 
the future due environmental dissemination.
  ESBL producing strains tend to show resistance 
towards  cephalosporins  which  lead  towards  the 
gene  pool  of  strains  with  high  level  of  resistance 
in the environment. The environment in this way 
has  become  a  great  reservoir  of  ESBL  strains. 
This situation has dragged our condition towards 
increased load of antibiotics, poor clinical outcome 
and limited therapeutic options.
