Abstract

Aim: The study was undertaken to isolate pathogenic E. coli from milk and various milk products, detection of virulence gene 
using Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and investigate their antibiotic sensitivity pattern.  
Materials and Methods: Altogether 250 milk and various milk products samples consisting of raw milk (50), cheese (50), 
ice-cream (50), mawa (50) and dahi (50) were collected from milk vendors, retail shops located in Anand city, under aseptic 
precautions. For the enrichment of the organism from the collected samples, MacConkey broth was used and inoculation was 
carried out on MacConkey agar and EMB agar. Later on, to confirm the isolates, various biochemical tests such as IMViC test, 
Urease test were performed. Evaluation of antibiotic sensitivity pattern of E. coli was assessed by disk diffusion method. 
Finally the E. coli isolates were screened for the presence of virulence associated genes by PCR .
Results: The prevalence of E. coli was observed 32 % in the samples comprising of milk (52.00%), cheese (28.00%), ice-
cream (20.00%), mawa (44.00%), and dahi (16.00%). Antibiotic sensitivity was recorded high for Co-trimoxazole (100%) 
followed by Gentamicin (96.73%), Trimithoprime (93.47%) and Doxycycline hydochloride (92.39%). Least sensitivity was 
recorded for Ampicillin (8.69%). In this study, out of 80 E. coli isolates, 25 isolates (31.25%) were positive for stx genes, of 
which 7 (8.75%) isolates were positive for stx1 gene only, while 12 (15.00%) isolates were positive for stx2 gene only and 5 
(6.25%) isolates were positive for both stx1 and stx2, 7 isolates (8.75%) were positive for eaeA gene and all the isolate were 
negetive for rfb O157 gene.
Conclusions: Current study supports the finding that raw milk and various milk products can be regarded as critical source of  
pathogenic E. coli This explains the need of strict monitoring and surveillance for effective measures of hygiene and sanitary 
practice during production of milk and various milk products.
Keywords: antibiotic sensitivity test, enteropathogenic E. coli, milk, milk products, PCR
Introduction

The most important causes of food borne diseases 
are Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) among the 
other  seropathotypes  of  E.  coli  [5].  STEC  produce 
various  complications  including  diarrhea,  hemolytic 
uremic syndrome (HUS) and hemorrhagic colitis (HC) 
[6]. Report indicate that consumption of raw milk and 
various milk products related with occurrence of 1 to5 
per cent of food infections and among that 53 per cent 
of cases produced by enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) [7]. 
In view of the these particulars, the current study 
was undertaken to detect and characterize the E. coli 
from milk and  various milk products, collected from 
the milk vendors, retail shops in and around Anand city, 
Gujarat.

Raw milk consumers have existed in various parts 
of  the  world.  World  milk  production  reached  724 
million  tons  in  2010  as  per  Food  and  Agriculture 
Organization,  resulting  in  trade  and  massive 
consumption of various milk products [1]. Raw milk is 
consumed directly by a large population in rural areas. 
Milk  is  an  excellent  medium  for  the  growth  of 
numerous  microbes  which  produce  consequential 
spoilage  of  the  milk  and  various  milk  products  or 
infections in consumers [2]. Because of the specific 
production, it is impossible to avoid contamination of 
milk  with  microorganisms  therefore  the  microbial 
content of milk is a major feature in determining its 
quality [3]. The existence of food borne pathogens in  Materials and Methods

Detection of virulence genes: In this study, out of

In the present study 12 (15.00%)  E. coli isolates 
found positive for stx1gene and 18 (22.50%) E. coli

predominance of stx2 producing strains were reported

Out  of  80  E.  coli  isolates  from  raw  milk  and 
various milk products, 7 isolates (8.75%) were positive 
for eaeA gene. Similar findings were reported by Lih 
Ching et al. [35], Lorusso et al. [36], Adjehi et al. [37], 
Bandyopadhyay et al. [15], Mohd et al. [18]. In contrast 
to present study high prevalence has also been recorded 
by Karns et al. [38] and Njage et al. [33]. In some study, 
not any isolates were found positive for eaeA [23,29,30].
In this study, none of the isolate was positive for 
rfb O157 gene. The similar results were reported by Lih 
Ching et al. [35], Caro et al. [29], and Stephan et al. 
[30]. In contrast to present study, Mansouri-Najand and 
Khalili  [28]  reported  one  E.  coli  O157  from  cheese 
samples.
Conclusion

The majority of raw milk and various milk products 
samples were found to be contaminated or carried E. 
coli infections, which require strict management for 
effective measures for hygiene and sanitary practice. 
The high percentage resistance in bacterial isolates to 
ampicilin, oxytetracycline, streptomycin and nalidixic 
acid requires further research. Continuous efforts are 
required to reduce the resistance burden in human by 
strict monitoring of antibiotic resistance of E. coli from 
milk and various milk products samples. PCR based 
molecular  epidemiological  studies  are  required  for 
detection of all types of pathogenic as well as zoonotic 
potential strains of E. coli isolates for future research.
