Microorganisms causing subclinical mastitis in water buffalo were isolated from 20 
buffalo milk samples at four dairy farms located in central region of São Paulo State, Bra-
zil, through testing of somatic cell count (SCC), standard plate count (SPC), biochemical, 
PCR assays and antimicrobial profile. The SCC showed average of 721,000 cells/mL in the 
milk, indicating the presence of subclinical mastitis. The overall average for SPC was 1.8 
x 104 CFU/mL. The microorganism most frequently isolation according to biochemical 
tests were: Staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), Staphylococcus aureus (15%), Bacillus spp. 
(14%), Acinetobacter spp. (12.5%); with intermediate frequency: Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
(9.5%); Shigella flexneri (7.0%), Streptococcus spp. (5.5%), Corynebacterium spp. (5.0%), 
Escherichia coli (4.5%), Serratia marcescens (4.0%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.0%), 
and low incidence: Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis (0.5%), Klebsiella ozaenae (0.5%), Tatumella 
ptyseos (0.5%), Enterobacter cloacae (0.5%). The molecular analysis indicated that sam-
ples positive by culture method of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and E. coli were 
positive by PCR. Para S. aureus and S. epidermidis the highest percentages of observed sen-
sitivity were gentamicin (100%) and vancomycin (100%); for the genus Streptococcus to 
gentamicin and oxacillin and E. coli to Ampicilin. These findings may help in the control and 
treatment of subclinical mastitis in buffaloes and contribute to improving the efficiency 
and quality of the milk produced.

The buffalo milk production is a highly important activi-
ty in many countries, among which are highlighted Asian 
countries, Italy and Brazil (Bernardes 2007). In Brazil, the 
buffalo has been exploited for milk and meat, but the main 
economic activity is the dairy industry, especially the mo-
zzarella cheese produced exclusively with buffalo milk (An-
drighetto et al. 2005, Bernardes 2007, Araujo et al. 2012). 
Buffalo milk has a great potential for commercial produc-
tion due mainly contain particular physicochemical charac-
teristics with high total solids, fat and protein (Amaral et 
al. 2005).
The importance of identifying the aspects related to the 
health of the mammary gland and milk products of buffalo-
es has been highlighted in the world literature as in Brazil 
(Medeiros et al. 2011), India (Tiwari et al. 2011), Pakistan 
(Hussain et al. 2013), Nepal (Dhakal et al. 2007), Italy (Fa-
giolo & Lai 2007) and Germany (Braun & Preuss 2007). 
Mastitis is an inflammation of the mammary gland paren-
chyma due to an infectious process predominantly caused 
by many microorganisms, particularly bacteria, and may 
also be involved fungi and yeast (Baloch et al. 2011). The 
effective and accurate diagnosis is extremely important to 
control this severe disease in buffalo (Viana et al. 2010). 
However, the absence of macroscopic changes in the tis-
sues or secretions in cases of subclinical mastitis, does not 
allow the identification of infected mammary quarters be-
fore milking, once routine diagnostic methods include only 
physical examination, and fluid secretion (Bonini Pardo et 
al. 2007). Several factors have been identified as predispo-
sing to subclinical mastitis in buffalo, as level of milk pro-
duction, body weight, calving period, udder type and hygie-
ne conditions for milking (Hussain et al. 2013).
Along the lack of information on the buffalo species, 
the same animal management techniques for cattle milk 
production are used for the control of mastitis in buffa-
lo milk production, resulting in lack of success since they 
have peculiar habits of each ruminant species (Carvalho 
et al. 2007, Medeiros et al. 2011). Indeed, most of mastitis 
prevalence was found in cow’s milk (32%) than in buffalo 
milk (22%) (Khan et al. 2013). Thus, subclinical mastitis 

unfortunately has not been diagnosed with frequency and 
consequently its etiology has not been widely investigated 
(Fagiolo & Lai 2007). In addition, Brazilian literature has 
presented a considerable number of publications about 
the buffalo mastitis, but when compared to the number of 
papers on bovine mastitis is small. A fact that needs more 
research efforts because buffalo has attracted growing in-
terest of breeders and research institutions as an alternati-
ve for dairy farming (Langoni et al. 2001, Jorge et al. 2005, 
Medeiros et al. 2011).
The objective of this work was the isolation and phe-
notypic characterization of the main microorganisms that 
cause mastitis subclinical in buffaloes (Bubalus  bubalis) 
raised in four dairy farms located in central region of Sao 
Paulo state, Brazil, as well as the molecular characteriza-
tion and evaluation of bacterial sensitivity profile for the 
isolated species.MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was carried out at four commercial buffalo farms in 
the central region of São Paulo State, Brazil, using animals reared 
in a loose housing system with supplementation of concentrated 
ration according to the stage of lactation. Water and mineral sup-
plementation were available ad libitum. The procedures involved 
in this experiment were approved by Comissão de Ética no Uso 
de Animais (CEUA/FZEA) (Protocol #13.1.2338.74.7). In order to 
select buffaloes more prone to subclinical mastitis, sanitary con-
trol data carried out by the property were evaluated and Somatic 
Cell Count test (SCC) of all of the female buffaloes in the herd at 
previous month were taken in account. Thus, milk samples were 
selected from twenty animals that showed SCC values above to 
200,000 cells/mL (Dhakal 2006). Selected animals were dairy bu-
ffaloes of Murrah breed, in the second or third stage of lactation, 
with average production of 7 kg of milk/animal/day, in two daily 
milking. After the physical examination of the mammary gland, 
twenty milk samples were collected by combining the four quar-
ters of the mammary in duplicate with all necessary hygiene, pro-
perly identified and packed in insulated boxes with ice packs.
One of the samples, collected in a bottle containing Bromopol 
(Microtabs®) was designed to determine the SCC by flow cytome-
try using Somacount 500 equipment. The second sample was col-
lected aseptically for microbiological analysis and antimicrobial 
susceptibility testing. For the Standard Plate Count (SPC), the milk 
samples were diluted in sterile peptone water solution (Hime-
dia®, India) at 0.1% (w/v). Aliquot 0.1 mL of each dilution (10-1, 
10-2, 10-3, 10-4 and 10-5) was inoculated into Brain Heart Infusion 
agar (BHI - Difco, USA) and incubated at 37°C under aerobic con-
ditions for 48 hours. Then, the read of the plates was carried out 
after the incubation. Ten colonies with different characteristics 
were picked up randomly per animal and seeded by exhaustion 
for the isolation of colonies in different culture media: blood agar 
(Acumedia®, USA), Eosin Methylene Blue Agar (Himedia®, India), 
Mannitol Agar (Himedia ®, India) and MacConkey Agar (Himedia®, 
India). The microorganism pure of the respective boards were 
identified based on Gram stain, morphology and macroscopic 
characteristics.
Biochemical tests were subsequently carried out in accor-
dance with bacterial groups identified in previous tests. Strains 
of Staphylococcus spp. were submitted to the free coagulase tests 
(Plasma Coagulase EDTA, Coagu LB - Laborclin, Brazil), DNase 
(DNase Agar -Difco®, USA), latex agglutination particles (Labor-
clin, Brazil) and catalase test. The tests of glucose fermentation 

Pesq. Vet. Bras. 37(5):447-452, maio 2017Andrea Vásquez-García et al.(aerobiosis) and mannitol (aerobiosis and anaerobiosis) were 
performed according (Macfaddin 1980) and isolates classified in 
accordance with (Baird-Parker 1990).
Gram negative bacteria isolated were identified using Bactray 
Kit I, II and III® of biochemical identification (Laborclin, Brazil). 
The genus Bacillus was featured on nutrient agar by the formation 
of colonies rounded, smooth and irregular border with creamy 
consistency, gram stain and rod shape with catalase and oxidase 
test. The bacteria whose colonies had become small, round, whit-
ish or creamy, with rough surface, measuring 1 to 2 mm in diam-
eter, gram-positive rods, absence of hemolysis on blood agar, cata-
lase production, were classified as Corynebacterium spp. Tests for 
Streptococcus genus identification included absence of catalase 
production, growth in Bile Agar Esculin (Himedia®, India), type of 
hemolysis on blood agar (α, β and γ hemolytic) with 5% defibri-
nated blood sheep and tolerance to tellurite.
The molecular characterization of isolated  Staphylococcus 
spp., Streptococcus spp. and E. coli were performed according to 
Shome et al. (2011) with some modifications. Isolated microor-
ganisms of cultures incubated for 18 hours at 37°C in Brain Heart 
Infusion agar (BHI - Difco, USA) were replicated in one mL of 
broth in BHI and incubated at 37°C under stirring for 24 hours. 
After centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 10 min, the supernatant was 
discarded and the pellet was solubilized in 100 uL of MilliQ water, 
homogenized and incubated at 95°C for 10 min. Then the wells 
were centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 2 min at room temperature, and 
the supernatant was used as a substrate for PCR reactions (Fang & 
Hedin 2003). The concentration of genomic DNA was determined 
using genequant pro RNA/DNA calculator, GE Healthcare, EUA 
and stored at 20°C until use. Six pairs of primers were selected for 
amplification of genomic fragments of bacterial strains belonging 
to the genera Staphylococcus (23S rRNA, sodA, rdr and gap genes), 
three pairs of primers to the genera Streptococcus (16S rRNA and 
cpn60 genes), and one pair of primers to the E. coli (phoA gene) 
(Shome et al. 2011) (Table 1).
For the PCR reactions were used GoTaq® Green Master Mix 
kit (Promega Corporation, USA) according to the manufacturer’s 
recommendations. Briefly, the PCR reaction has consisted of a 
solution containing around 200ng of DNA; 12.5µL of GoTaq® 
Colorless Master Mix 2X; 0.4µM of each specific sense primer; 
0.4µM of each specific antisense primer and 9.5μL of nuclease-

free water (GE Healthcare, USA) totaling 25.0μL. The thermo-
cycling protocol (Swift® MaxPro Thermal Cycler, Esco Technolo-
gies Inc., USA) was: initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, and 30 
cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 60°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 45 sec and 
final extension at 72°C for 10 min (Shome et al. 2011). The re-
sulting amplicons were subjected to electrophoresis in agarose 
gel 2% in Tris-acetate/EDTA buffer (TAE 1X) in 8mL volume per 
sample, adding a 2mL of a solution containing 10mM Tris- HCl 
(pH 7.5), 50mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.03% (w/v) bromophenol blue, 
0.03% xylene cyanol FF and 15% Ficoll® 400 (Blue / Orange 
Loading Dye, 6X, Promega, USA).
Subsequently, the gel was subjected to staining solution of 
SYBR® Gold nucleic acid gel stain (Life Technologies, USA) and ob-
served under UV light, using a photo documentation system L-Pix 
ST and L-PixImage software (Loccus Biotechnology, Brazil). The 
size of the fragments was determined by comparison of the pat-
tern of electrophoretic migration of a molecular weight marker 
100pb (GE Healthcare, USA). The standard strains  Staphylococ-
cus aureus ATCC 29213, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, 
Escherichia coli ATCC 43895 were used as controls of the reac-
tions.The antimicrobial profile was determined using eight iso-
lates of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. agalactiae and E. coli previ-
ously identified in biochemical and molecular tests. After grow-
ing in BHI incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours, the bacterial cultures 
were plated on Mueller Hinton Agar (Himedia®, India) for car-
rying out the antibiograms, through the simple method disk, ac-
cording to the technique described by Bauer (1966). The follow-
ing antibiotics and dosages for Staphylococcus and Streptococcus 
genera were used: cefepime (30μg) clindamycin (2μg), eryth-
romycin (15μg), gentamicin (10μg), oxacillin (1μg), penicillin 
G (10μg), rifampicin (34μg), sulphazotrim (25 μg), tetracycline 
(30μg) and vancomycin (30μg) and for E. coli: ampicillin (10μg), 
amoxicillin + clavulanate (30μg), ceftazidime (30μg), cefepime 
(30μg), cefoxitin (30μg), cefuroxime (30μg), gentamicin (10μg), 
meropenem (10μg), cephalothin (30μg) and Trimethoprim + 
sulphazotrim (25μg). The plates were incubated for 24 hours at 
37°C. After reading the halos formed around the discs, we deter-
mined the sensitivity profile and resistance of isolated accord-
ing to the manual for antibiogram diffusion in Kirby-Bauer disk 
(Laborclin, Brazil).

The average Somatic cell count was 721,000 cells/mL of 
milk (minimum: 205,000, maximum: 2.264 million), in-
dicating the presence of subclinical mastitis. All positive 
-samples by culture method were also positive by PCR that 
confirmed the identity of the Staphylococcus aureus, S. epi-
dermidis and E. coli species with amplimers electrophoretic 
pattern compatible with the described species. Two isola-
tes have showed an amplification product (500 bp) specific 
to Streptococcus dysgalactiae and eight isolates have sho-
wed an amplification product of 300pb in PCR for Strepto-
coccus. agalactiae.
All twenty samples showed bacterial growth in the BHI 
agar. The overall average of standard plate count obtained 
in this study was 1.8x104 CFU/mL. Two hundred isolates 
recovered from milk samples culture were submitted to 
phenotypic and biochemical characterization (Table 2). 
S. epidermidis (17%) was the most frequently isolated or-
ganism, followed by S. aureus (15%). As further relates to 
Gram-positive pathogens, there was high isolation Bacillus 
spp. in buffalo milk (14%). However, bacteria of the ge-
nus Streptococcus spp. had a lower frequency of isolation 
(5.5%) as well as the gram negative bacteria E. coli (4.5%).

The study of bacterial sensitivity (Table 3) has showed 
that S. aureus and S. epidermidis bacteria were more sen-
sitive to antibiotics gentamicin (100%) and vancomycin 
(100%). For the genus Streptococcus, gentamicin and oxa-
cillin were the best action antibiotics, followed by sulpha-
zotrim. In contrast, gentamicin was a less effective antimi-
crobial (50%) for Escherichia coli isolates (Table 4).
The higher average obtained from the SCC (721,000 cells/
mL) was expected, since the sampling was restricted to bu-
ffaloes that had high SCC in order to obtain samples with 
microorganisms that may cause subclinical mastitis. It was 
high compared to average values of 63,000 cells/mL ob-
served in 2693 buffalo milk samples belonging to a single 
herd from state of Sao Paulo (Cerón-Muñoz et al. 2002) and 
63,380 cells/mL mean value identified in lactating buffa-
loes also in Brazil (Jorge et al. 2005). Subclinical mastitis 
in buffalo milk samples was previously described with SCC 
greater than 200,000 cells/mL and positive bacterial gro-
wth in culture in 21.7% (52/200) of the evaluated animals 
(Dhakal 2006). High SCC has been obtained in crossbred 
Murrah buffaloes, with values of 171,000 cells/mL for ani-
mals without mastitis, 799,000 cells/mL for animals with 
subclinical mastitis and 6,039,000 cells/mL with clinical 
mastitis (Dhakal et al. 2008).
The most often agents isolated in the samples Staphylo-
coccus  epidermidis (17%) and  S.  aureus (15%) (Table 2) 
were similar to those obtained in 49 adult Murrah buffalo 
at different stages of lactation in herds from state of Per-
nambuco, Brazil (Oliveira et al. 2004). In that study, the 
Staphylococcus genus was considered the main etiological 
agent, being of great epidemiological importance in buffalo 
mastitis. Indeed, the genus  Staphylococcus has been pre-
dominantly isolated in samples from buffalo Murrah cros-
sbred with subclinical mastitis (Dhakal et al. 2008) and 
clinical mastitis (Pizauro et al. 2014). Khan and Muham-
mad (2005) obtained similar prevalence for microbiolo-
gical analysis in milk samples of buffalos from Pakistan: 
Staphylococcus spp. (45%), Streptococcus spp. (23%) and 
Bacillus spp. (14%). However, Khan et al. (2013) observed a 
greater prevalence of S. aureus in cow milk samples (90%) 
than in buffalo milk (84%). Langoni et al. (2001) observed 

Pesq. Vet. Bras. 37(5):447-452, maio 2017Andrea Vásquez-García et al.prevalence of S. epidermidis (30.1%) and S. aureus (4.8%) 
in buffaloes with mastitis in São Paulo, Brazil. Other stu-
dies have also identified a high prevalence of S. epidermidis 
(Tenhagen et al. 2009, Sampimon et al. 2009, Pankaj et al. 
2013), indicating the importance of this group of microor-
ganisms which are commonly described as lower prevalen-
ce of pathogens in the case of mastitis. In addition, S. epi-
dermidis is a component of the normal flora of the skin of 
the udder and its prevalence, as observed in this study may 
be a result of poor hygienic practices for milking.
Acinetobacter was isolated with a frequency also con-
sidered high of 12.5% in this study. Similar results were 
found in cows with clinical mastitis and milk samples with 
mastitis in Korea (Nam et al. 2009, 2010, Gurung et al. 
2013). The association of this bacterium with subclinical 
mastitis in buffaloes presents a new challenge for the treat-
ment and control of disease. There is need for further stu-
dies to evaluate its role as a pathogen potential and identify 
possible sources of contamination.
The percentage of  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa isolated, 
can be related to the occurrence of the contamination in 
milk during and/or after milking, such as contaminated 
water used for washing the teat, cleaning and during in-
tramammary therapy (Fernandes et al. 2009, Langoni et al. 
2009).The incidence of Bacillus spp. observed (14%) is found 
within a wide occurrence in buffalo milk samples ranging 
from 2.4 to 32.4% (Langoni et al. 2001, Oliveira et al. 2004, 
Dhakal et al. 2008). This level of detection may differ ac-
cording to the type of sample of milk, herd and region. This 
kind of bacteria is widely distributed in soil, water, air, feces 
and vegetation.
Although  Streptococcus are considered less frequent 
agents of mastitis, as also obtained in this study, these op-
portunistic pathogens are widespread in the environment 
and can be found on the ground, water and manure. Howe-
ver, some studies have identified the Streptococcus spp. as 
the major etiologic agent isolated from buffalo subclinical 
mastitis (Fagiolo & Lai 2007).
Low frequency of  E.  coli was observed in this study 
(4.5%) being in agreement with the data obtained by Saini 
et al. (1994) that observed lower frequency of microorga-
nisms E. coli (12.9%) in buffalo milk samples from Punjab, 
India. Moreover, Kumar (2009) observed buffalo milk sam-
ples with high incidence of mastitis E. coli (30%).
Other species of bacteria as  Lactococcus  garvieae and 
Enterococcus gallinarum have been isolated from milk sam-
ples of buffalo subclinical mastitis (Vianni & Lazaro 2003). 
Arcobacter species also has considered an important sour-
ce of bacteria in cow and buffalo milk with risk to public 
health (Yesilmen et al. 2014).
Conventional bacterial culture is relatively slow perfor-
mance, since incubation of primary cultures often requires 
48 hours (or 72 hours) to be completed, and additional 
confirmatory tests are relatively time-consuming. The PCR 
assay for the identification of microorganisms in milk sam-
ples with mastitis require an analysis time of 3 to 4 hours. 
In the case of subclinical mastitis such quick results may 
allow the identification of animals with this disease and 

451
indicate the treatment, while optimizing the results with 
appropriate use of antibiotics and reduce the indiscrimina-
te usage. Moreover, PCR has been shown to be more sen-
sitive and specific for the diagnosis of microorganisms in 
subclinical mastitis than conventional culturing technique 
(Shahzad et al. 2013).
Gentamicin was the antibiotic of choice for Staphylococ-
cus and Streptococcus bacteria (Table 3) partially agreeing 
with the findings of Cunha et al. (2006) who observed a 
wide gentamicin action with high antimicrobial efficacy 
(97.98%) on various bacteria and association including 
Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp. and E. coli. Howe-
ver, gentamicin was one of the less effective antimicrobial 
(50%) for E. coli isolates (Table 4). But, this finding agrees 
with the results of Costa (2008) who observed that amino-
glycosides and sulfonamides were the antimicrobials less 
effective for E. coli, highlighting the sensitivity percentage 
of 46.2% and 41.8% for gentamicin and neomycin, respec-
tively.For the genus  Streptococcus, gentamicin and oxacillin 
were the best action antibiotics, followed by sulphazotrim 
(Table 3), confirming the data of Langoni et al. (2001) who 
have demonstrated a better efficiency of gentamicin (96%) 
and oxacillin (95%) on the isolated agents with more fre-
quency: Corynebacterium bovis, Staphylococcus epidermidis 
and Streptococcus agalactiae.
The somatic cell count and standard plate count can 
perform an assessment of the health status of the buffalo 
mammary gland with subclinical mastitis and emphasize 
the importance of a normative specific for buffalo that allo-
ws the control and inspection of milk, since the parameters 
used for cattle may not be suitable for monitoring mastitis 
in buffalo herds.
This study highlights the importance of some pathogens in-
volved subclinical mastitis in buffaloes and the possibility 
of specific antimicrobial use in the control and treatment of 
this serious problem, promoting increased quality and milk 
production with effective reduction of production costs 
and improvement in health foods.
