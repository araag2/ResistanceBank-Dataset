ABSTRACT.  Approximately 39.9% (63/158) of beef samples collected from retail markets in Hanoi from January to June 2009 were Salmo-
nella-positive. Nine Salmonella serovars, Anatum (28.6%), Rissen (25.4%), Weltevreden (12.7%), Typhimurium (7.9%), Derby (7.9%), 
Lexington (7.9%), Dublin (4.6%), Newport (3.2%) and London (1.8%), were identified. Thirty-seven (58.7%) of the 63 Salmonella iso-
lates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial tested, of which 29 (46%) isolates showed multidrug resistance (MDR). The isolates were 
commonly resistant to tetracycline (46.0%), sulphonamide (39.7%), ampicilline (31.7%), streptomycin (30.2%), trimethoprim (28.6%), 
kanamycin (28.6%) and chloramphenicol (22.2%). Fourteen (blaTEM, blaOXA-1, aadA1, aadA2, sul1, tetA, tetB, tetG, cmlA1, floR, dfrA1, 
dfrA12, aac (3)-IV and aphA1-1AB) out of 22 antimicrobial resistance genes were detected by PCR from the resistant isolates. The catA1, 
Kn, blaPSE-1 genes and plasmid-mediated quinolones resistance (PMQR) genes such as qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, qepA and acc (6’)-ib-cr were 
not detected. Mutations in the gyrA gene leading to the amino acid changes Ser83Phe and/or Asp87Asn were found in 6 out of the 11 
quinolone-resistant isolates. The data revealed that multidrug resistant Salmonella strains were widely distributed in north Vietnam via the 
food chain and might contain multiple genes specifying identical resistant phenotypes. Thus, continuous studies are necessary to clarify 
the mechanisms of MDR in Salmonella and its spread in the livestock market.

Foodborne  diseases  caused  by  non-typhoid  Salmonella 
represent an important public health problem and an eco-
nomic  burden  in  many  parts  of  the  world.  Non-typhoidal 
Salmonella spp. are zoonotic agents, and foods of animal 
origin are the main sources for their transmission.

The emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant Sal-
monella originating from food animals or retail meats has 
become a serious health hazard worldwide, especially in de-
veloping countries [34, 38]. In food animal production, anti-
microbials have been used for disease treatment and disease 
prevention, as well as growth promotion, and are important 
factors in the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. 
Several lines of evidence indicate that antimicrobial resis-
tance among human Salmonella infections results from the 
use of antimicrobial agents in food animals [2].

The increasing resistance of Salmonella to the older gen-
eration antimicrobials has been leading to the use of quino-
lones in order to combat salmonellosis. The main mecha-
nism  of  quinolone  resistance  was  believed  to  arise  from 
chromosomal mutations in genes encoding target enzymes,

DNA gyrase (gyrA and gyrB) and/or DNA topoisomerase 
IV  (parC  and  parE),  or  affecting  drug  accumulation  [16, 
39]. Besides mutations in chromosomes, plasmid-mediated 
quinolone resistance (PMQRs) has also been reported, in-
cluding a qnr-mediated inhibition of quinolone binding to 
DNA, a qepA encoded efflux pump, and the aac(6’)-Ib-cr 
mediated fluoroquinolones by an acetyltransferase [30, 32].
In Vietnam, self-medication through retail pharmacies is 
a common practice, where antimicrobials for humans and 
animals can be freely purchased over the counter without 
control [28]. Farmers normally use antimicrobials to treat 
sick animals with high doses and using their own experi-
ence without veterinary prescription, supervision and labo-
ratory diagnosis [35]. So far, most studies have focused on 
the prevalence and molecular mechanisms of antimicrobial 
resistance  of  Salmonella  spp.  isolates  from  human  medi-
cine,  whereas  similar  studies  on  Salmonella  originating 
from food animals are rare and limited [34, 37].

The aims of this study were to examine the level of Sal-
monella  contamination  in  retail  beef  at  markets  in  North 
Vietnam. The antimicrobial resistance of each isolate was 
further determined, and the antimicrobial resistance genes 
and  mutations  encoding  for  resistance  phenotypes  were 
identified.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sampling  methods:  A  total  of  158  raw  beef  samples 
were collected from retail markets in Hanoi, Vietnam, from 
January to June 2009. In each meat shop, one sample from a 
carcass (>100 g) was collected and placed in a sterile plastic 
sampling bag and chilled in an ice box during transport to the 
laboratory at the Department of Microbiology − Infectious 
Disease − Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hanoi 
University of Agriculture. All samples were analyzed on the 
day of arrival.

Salmonella isolation: Salmonella was isolated according 
to  the  Standard  ISO-6579  method  [19]  with  some  modi-
fications.  For  pre-enrichment  of  Salmonella,  25  g  of  each 
sample  was  homogenized  in  sterile  bags  with  225  ml  of 
buffered  peptone  water  (PBW)  and  incubated  at  37°C  for 
18–24 hr. Next, 0.1 ml of the pre-enriched culture in PBW 
was  added  to  10  ml  of  Rappaport-Vassiliadis  soya  (RVS) 
broth followed by further incubation at 41.5°C for 24 hr. A 
loopful of culture broth was then sampled from the selective 
enrichment RVS broth, streaked onto xylose-lysine-tergitol 
4 agar (Merck) and incubated at 37°C for 24 hr. Presumptive 
black colonies were selected from each plate and cultured 
on  nutrient  agar  slants. The  isolates  were  confirmed  to  be 
Salmonella by confirmatory biochemical tests (fermentation 
of glucose, lactose and sucrose; hydrogen sulphide produc-
tion test; citrate test; lysine decarboxylation; and methyl red 
and indole tests).

Salmonella serotyping: Typical Salmonella isolates were 
serotyped  on  slides  by  the  microtiter  agglutination  test  to 
identify O and H antigens (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, 
U.S.A.),  according  to  the  version  of  the  Kauffmann  and 
White  scheme  used  [17]  by  the  Department  of  Veterinary 
Hygiene, National of Institute Veterinary Research, Vietnam.
Antimicrobial  susceptibility  testing:  The  antimicrobial 
susceptibility  of  isolates  was  determined  according  to  the 
guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 
[8]. Disk diffusion assays were performed on Muller-Hinton 
agar with disks containing 15 different antimicrobial agents 
(Oxoid,  UK).  The  following  antimicrobials  were  tested: 
ampicillin  (A),  10  µg;  amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid  (Ac), 
20/10  µg;  ceftazidime  (Cf),  30  µg;  chloramphenicol  (Cl), 
30 µg; ciprofloxacin (Ci), 5 µg; gentamicin (G), 10 µg; ka-
namycin (K), 30 µg; nalidixic acid (Na), 30 µg; neomycin 
(Ne), 10 µg; norfloxacin (No), 10 µg; streptomycin (S), 10 
µg;  tetracycline  (T),  30  µg;  trimethoprim  (Tp),  5  µg;  and 
sulphonamide  (Su),  300  µg.  The  interpretive  categories 
susceptible, intermediate and resistant were used according 
to CLSI guidelines [9], except for colistin (Co), for which 
the  zone  criteria  of  ≤11  mm  for  resistant  and≥14  mm  for 
susceptible were used [15]. Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 
was used as the control. An isolate was defined “resistance” 
after confirmation of resistance to at least one agent tested, 
while “multiple resistance” was defined as resistance to 3 or 
more agents.

Detection  of  resistance  genes:  DNA  templates  used  for 
PCR were prepared by boiling bacterial cultures [31]. The 
following  genes  implicated  with  antimicrobial  resistance 

were detected by PCR amplification: blaPSE-1, blaOXA-1 and 
blaTEM  encoding  β-lactam  resistance;  aadA1,  aadA2,  aac 
(3)-IV,  aphA-1AB  and  Kn  encoding  aminoglycoside  resis-
tance; catA1, cmlA1 and floR encoding chloramphenicol re-
sistance; sul1 encoding sulphonamide resistance; tetA, tetB 
and  tetG  encoding  tetracycline  resistance;  and  dfrA1  and 
dfrA12 encoding trimethoprim resistance. PMQR genes such 
as qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, qepA, and aac (6’)-ib-cr and quinolone 
resistance determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA were pre-
sented for quinolone resistance. The primer sets and assay 
conditions used for amplification were described elsewhere 
[4, 12, 13, 16, 18, 21, 27].

PCR  amplification  reactions  were  performed  in  a  25 µl 
volume of reaction mixture containing 12.5 µl of GoTaq® 
Green Master Mix, 2 × (Promega, U.S.A.), 1 µl(10 ng/µl) 
of primers, 4 µl of DNA template and nuclease-free water. 
The PCR program consisted of hot start cycle of 94°C for 
5 min; followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, the cor-
responding temperature for each primer pair for 30 sec and 
72°C for 1 min; and then a final extension step of 72°C for 
5 min. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis 
with 1.5% agarose in 1×Tris-boric acid-TBE buffer. The gels 
were stained with 1 µg/ml ethidium bromide, and visualized 
bands were photographed using a Polaroid camera on an ul-
traviolet light transilluminator. A molecular weight standard 
ladder was included on each gel (Toyobo, Japan).

Sequencing of gyrA: PCR amplifications of gyrA to detect 
substitutions  at  codon  81,  83  and  87  were  carried  out  us-
ing the primers from a previous report [13]. Purified PCR 
products were sequenced and compared with the wild-type 
sequences (GenBank accession number X78977.1).

RESULTS

Salmonella  isolation  and  distribution:  Approximately 
39.9% (63/158) of beef samples collected from retail mar-
kets in Hanoi City were Salmonella positive, and 9 serovars 
were  identified  (Table  1).  The  common  serovars  were 
Anatum  (28.6%),  Rissen  (25.4%),  Weltevreden  (12.7%), 
Typhimurium (7.9%), Derby (7.9%) and Lexington (7.9%), 
and the remaining serovars were London, Newport and Dub-
lin (ranging from 1.6 to 4.8%).

Antimicrobial  susceptibility:  The  Salmonella  isolates 
were commonly resistant to tetracycline (46.0%), sulphon-
amide (39.7%), ampicillin (31.7%), streptomycin (30.2%), 
trimethoprim  (28.6%),  kanamycin  (28.6%)  and  chloram-
phenicol (22.2%). None of the Salmonella isolates showed 
resistance to ceftazidime and colistin (Table 1). Thirty-three 
(58.7%)  of  the  63  Salmonella  isolates  were  resistant  to  at 
least one antimicrobial (Table 2). Twenty nine (46%) out of 
the 63 isolates showed multidrug resistance (MDR). MDR 
was frequently observed in serovars Anatum, Typhimurium, 
Rissen and Derby.

Detection  of  antimicrobial  resistance  genes:  Fourteen 
(blaTEM,  blaOXA-1,  aadA1,  aadA2,  sul1,  tetA,  tetB,  tetG, 
cmlA1, floR, dfrA1, dfrA12, aac (3)-IV and aphA1-1AB) of 
17 resistance genes were detected from the resistant isolates 
(Table 3). Among the 29 tetracycline-resistant isolates, the

tetA gene was detected from 16 (55.2%), while tetB or tetG 
genes were detected only in one (3.4%) isolate. None of the 
20 ampicillin-resistant isolates carried the blaPSE-1 gene; the 
blaTEM gene was detected in 18 (90.0%) isolates, of which 
one contained more blaOXA-1 gene. The sul1 gene was de-
tected in 20 (80%) of the 25 sulphonamide-resistant isolates. 
Among  the  14  chloramphenicol-resistant  isolates,  none 
of  the  isolates  contained  the  catA1  gene;  floR  and  cmlA1 
genes were detected in 8 (57.1%) and 7 (50%) isolates, re-
spectively. The aadA1 gene was found in 15 (78.9%) of the 
19  streptomycin-resistant  isolates,  of  which  one  contained 
more  aadA2  gene.  Among  the  18  trimethoprim-resistant 
isolates, 10 dfrA1(55.6%) and 6 dfrA12(33.3%) genes were 
displayed. All of the 18 kanamycin-resistant isolates carried 
the  aphA1-1AB  gene.  Eight  (88.9%)  of  the  9  gentamicin-
resistant isolates contained the aac (3)-IV gene.

Detection of the PMQR genes and substitutions in gyrA 

of  the  quinolone-resistant  isolates:  PMQR  genes  such  as 
qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, qepA and acc (6’)-ib-cr were not detected 
from  11  quinolone-resistant  isolates.  Sequence  analysis  of 
the  gyrA  revealed  that  6  isolates  had  substitutions  (Table 
4).  In  these  isolates,  three  S.  Typhimurium  and  two  S. 
Anatum isolates had single substitution at Ser83 and one S. 
Typhimurium isolate had double substitutions at Ser83 and 
Asp87. Substitutions were found in the codon TCC (Ser) at 
position  83  to  TTC  (Phe)  and  in  the  codon  GAC  (Asp)  at 
position 87 to AAC (Asn).

DISCUSSION

Approximately 39.9% of beef samples were contaminated 
with Salmonella. This rate was lower than that reported in 
similar previous studies in South Vietnam [29, 34]. The high 
levels  of  contamination  indicate  a  potential  breakdown  of

hygiene at various stages of the food processing and distribu-
tion chain and/or a lack of refrigeration of meat in Vietnam. 
Among  the  Salmonella  isolates  identified,  S. Anatum  was 
commonly detected in this study, similar to previously re-
ports in Vietnam [36, 37]. This serovar was usually listed in 

the common serovars from food sources in other studies [3, 
5, 7]. S. Rissen, one of the most commonly detected serovars 
from  both  human  and  nonhuman  sources  in Asia  [3],  was 
frequently recovered in our study. In addition, the serovars 
Typhimurium, Derby, Weltevreden and Newport were also

detected  in  this  study;  these  serovars  were  previously  as-
sociated with human foodborne gastroenteritis [1, 3, 6, 14, 
20]. Therefore, foodborne diseases may occur in Vietnam, 
because non-typhoidal Salmonella spp. are zoonotic agents 
and animal products originating are the main sources of Sal-
monella spp. transmission.

In this study, 58.7% of Salmonella isolates were resistant 
to  at  least  one  antimicrobial.  Resistance  to  tetracycline, 
sulphonamide,  ampicillin,  streptomycin,  trimethoprim  and 
chloramphenicol was commonly observed in the Salmonella 
isolates, as shown in previous reports from Vietnam [28, 34, 
37] and other Asia countries [33, 38]. These antimicrobials 
are commonly used in animal husbandry in these countries, 
and the increasing and inappropriate use of antimicrobials 
in animal farming may be the reason for these high levels 
of  resistance  [34].  MDR  was  observed  frequently  in  the 
Salmonella isolates in this study, as shown in previous stud-
ies  from  Vietnam  [28,  34,  37],  China  [38]  and  Malaysia 
[33]. This  might  lead  to  human  infections  with  foodborne 
antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Therefore, it may create an 
enormous challenge to treatment of Salmonella infection in 
humans and animals in these countries.

All of the antimicrobial-resistant isolates were investigat-
ed for the corresponding resistance genes. High prevalence 
of the tetA, blaTEM, floR, sul1 and dfrA1 genes was detected 
from the antimicrobial-resistant isolates, as shown in previ-
ous reports [24, 25]. The streptomycin resistance was mainly 
encoded by aadA1 in this study, as observed in reports from 
Thailand [1, 10]. These resistance genes were also detected 
from integrons of resistant Salmonella isolates from food-
stuffs in southern Vietnam [34, 37]. All of the kanamycin-
resistant isolates contained the aphA1-1AB gene, similar to 
previous reports [13, 25]. However, it was detected at a low 
rate from S. Infantis in Japan [31]. In this study, the resis-
tance genes were found at high rates and were widespread in 
different serovars from the resistant isolates, indicating that 
these genes play an important role in prevalence of antimi-
crobial resistance among the Salmonella isolates from retail 
meats in Vietnam.

The resistance to nalidixic acid (17.5%) and ciprofloxacin 
(3.2%) and decreased susceptibility to norfloxacin (3.2%) of 
the isolates in this study were similar to the results of a report 
in South Vietnam [37]. In addition, different levels of resis-
tance  of  Salmonella  to  these  antimicrobials  were  also  de-
scribed in several countries [11, 32, 33, 38]. This is a world-
wide concern, because ciprofloxacin is the drug of choice for 
treatment of human Salmonella infection. Similar to other 
studies [11, 37], we detected substitutions at codons Ser83 
and Asp87 of gyrA from six quinolone-resistant Salmonella 
isolates. Substitutions in the codon of gyrA such as Gly81, 
Ser83  and  Asp87  in  Salmonella  were  frequently  observed 
when the MIC levels of nalidixic acid and/or ciprofloxacin 
were very high (≥128 µl/ml for nalidixic acid and≥0.25 µl/
ml for ciprofloxacin) [11, 22, 23]. Thus, the absence of sub-
stitutions in gyrA in 5 nalidixic acid-resistant isolates in this 
study may be explained by other resistance mechanisms such 
as decreased permeability of the outer membrane, mutations 
in the gyrB, parC, parE genes. These will be warranted in 

the further our investigation. In this study, the PMQR genes 
were not detected in the quinolone-resistant Salmonella iso-
lates. However, they were detected at a very low rate from 
Salmonella in France [4] and the U.S.A. [16]. In addition, 
there  were  several  reports  on  Enterobacteriaceae  harbor-
ing  quinolone-resistant  genes  in  Vietnam  [26]  and  other 
countries [32]. These reports confirmed that PMQR genes in 
foodborne isolates may play a role in the spread of quinolone 
resistance  through  the  food  chain.  Therefore,  continuous 
research is needed to detect the PMQR genes in Salmonella 
spp. from food sources in Vietnam.

This  study  indicated  a  high  frequency  of  antimicrobial 
resistance  among  the  Salmonella  isolates  from  beef  at  re-
tail  markets  in  the  North Vietnam.  Resistance  genes  were 
widespread in Salmonella serovars isolates. Therefore, some 
management strategies are needed for public health to pre-
vent foodborne diseases caused by MDR Salmonella from 
the food supply.
