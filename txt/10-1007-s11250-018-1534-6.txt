Abstract
Staphylococcus aureus is among the microorganisms more frequently associated with subclinical bovine mastitis. S. aureus may
produce several virulence factors. This study aimed at determining the frequency of virulence factors such as enterotoxins, toxic
shock syndrome toxin 1, and ica adhesion genes. In addition, we assessed antimicrobial drug resistance in S. aureus isolated from
clinical and subclinical cases of mastitis. A total of 88 cows with clinical or subclinical mastitis were sampled, resulting in 38
S. aureus isolates, from which 25 (65.78%) carried toxin genes, including seb, sec, sed, tst, andicaD adhesion gene. These
S. aureus isolates belong to 21 ribotypes and three S. aureus strains belonged to the same ribotype producing ica adhesion gene.
Approximately 90% of S. aureus strains obtained in our study demonstrated multiple resistance to different antimicrobial agents.
The most efficacious antimicrobial agents against the isolates were gentamicin, amoxicillin, and norfloxacin. Gentamicin was the
most efficacious agent inhibiting 78.95% of the S. aureus isolates. The least efficacious were penicillin, streptomycin, and
ampicillin. Our results can help in understanding the relationship between virulence factors and subclinical mastitis caused by
S. aureus. Further research about diversity of S. aureus isolates and genes responsible for the pathogenicity of subclinical mastitis
is essential.

Introduction

Bovine mastitis is a major cause of economic losses in dairy
cattle, and it is usually associated with low incidence of clin-
ical cases and high incidence of subclinical infections, which
poses a challenge for controlling this disease (De Vliegher
et al. 2012; Thompson-Crispi et al. 2014). Some studies have
reported that subclinical mastitis is more prevalent than the
clinical disease form (Iyer et al. 2014; Viguier et al. 2009).
Among several bacterial agents that can cause contagious
mastitis, the genus Staphylococcus is one of the most

important (Pyorala and Taponen 2009). The species
Staphylococcus aureus is the pathogen more often associated
with subclinical cases of mastitis (Persson et al. 2011). In
addition, S. aureus has also relevance under a public health
point of view, due to the high frequency of resistance to anti-
microbial drugs, and the ability of this organism to produce
toxins that is an important cause of food poisoning.
Importantly, these toxins are resistant to high temperatures
such as those employed during the pasteurization process
(Schelin et al. 2011). Toxins genes and virulence factors are
related to pathogenicity and resistance of S. aureus strains to
various antimicrobial agents (Babra et al. 2013), interfering
the effectiveness of therapy and control methods of this bac-
terium present in intramammary gland of dairy cows (Kirkan
et al. 2005). The association between different virulence fac-
tors and the clinical disease manifestations is still barely
known.

Among the remarkable range of virulence factors of this
pathogen can be highlighted the toxic shock syndrome toxin-1
(TSST-1), staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE) and ica adhesion

gene (Melchior et al. 2007). Some of these factors may be of
more importance than others in different stages of the patho-
genesis of mastitis infections, as not all factors are produced
by all strains of S. aureus. These factors can be associated to
the severity of disease, chronic disease, and the difficulty of
treatment (Babra et al. 2013).

Elucidating the presence of virulence factors that
S. aureus can produce of accord with clinic form is valu-
able in developing control measures against this infec-
tious disease. We investigated the possibility of differen-
tiating Staphylococcus strains present in clinical and sub-
clinical mastitis by ribotyping technique. We amplified
the 16S and 23S rRNA genes that have been considered
as the gold standard for identification and taxonomic
classification of different bacteria species (Bouchet
et al. 2008; Kolbert and Persing 1999). The genes
encoding the enterotoxins Sea, Seb, Sec, Sed, and See
were evaluated in this study.

In the Maranhão state, Northeast of Brazil, the molec-
ular epidemiology of clinical and subclinical mastitis in
bovine dairy herds is unknown, as there are no studies
that show the epidemiological and antimicrobial resis-
tance aspects of this disease. Therefore, the goal of this
study was to characterize genotypes of S. aureus strains
associated with mammary infections in this region,
assessing the presence of genes related to toxin produc-
tion, the icaA and icaD genes that are associated with
biofilm formation, and the tst gene that is associated with
the toxic shock syndrome as well as determine the profile
of antimicrobial drug resistance of these isolates.

Materials and methods

Farms and sampling

This study included 10 farms located at the São Luis
Island (state of Maranhão, Brazil). Cattle were kept in a
semi-extensive system on these farms so they stayed in
pastures and received grain concentrate and a mineral
supplement. Cows were milked manually once a day in
the morning in the presence of their calves. Only on rare
occasions washing and disinfection of the teats were per-
formed prior to milking, and when performed, it was
followed by wiping with a cotton tissue used for all cows.
Pre- or post-dipping, strip cup test, or California Mastitis
Test (CMT) were not performed on any of the farms.

During the course of this study, milking cows from all
farms were subjected to the strip cup test and the CMT.
These tests were used as a screening of clinical and sub-
clinical cases of mastitis. Results were considered posi-
tive when milk samples from any of the quarters had
clots, pus, blood, or abnormal discoloration, or a score

≥ 1 at the CMT. Samples from positive cows were col-
lected for bacteriological culture, except from cows with-
in the first 10 days of lactation or 30 days before the end
of the lactation. Cows from four farms tested positive by
the strip cup test and CMT were sampled. These positive
farms were designated A, B, C, and D. A total of 88
cows were sampled. These samples were collected prior
to milking and after wiping the teats with 70% alcohol
with iodine, using sterile 100 mL vials. These samples
were transported at approximately 4 °C to the microbiol-

Identification of Staphylococcus aureus

Milk samples were plated on Columbia agar (Acumedia,
Baltimore, USA) with 5% ovine blood and Baird-Parker
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, USA), followed by incubation
at 37 °C for 48 h. We selected three to five typical
colonies from plates containing from 20 to 200 colonies
for morphologic evaluation. Colonies of Gram-positive
cocci were considered Staphylococcus sp. (Holmberg
1973).

These Staphylococcus spp. isolates were subjected to the
catalase and coagulase tests. Isolates that were positive in these
two tests were subjected to acetoin production assay by cultur-
ing in MRVP broth for differentiation between Staphylococcus
aureus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus delphini, and
Staphylococcus intermedius. Acetoin-producing isolates were
tested for maltose and trehalose utilization for differentiation
between Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus schleiferi
subspecies coagulans (Becker and Eiff 2011; Garcia 2010;
Lancette and Tatini 2001). Isolates that were positive in all
these tests were classified as Staphylococcus aureus (Garcia
2010, Lancette and Tatini 2001).

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

The isolates were subjected to in vitro susceptibility
using the disk diffusion test (Bauer et al. 1966), includ-
ing the following antimicrobial drugs: amoxicillin
(10 μg), lincomycin (2 μg), norfloxacin (10 μg), ampi-
cillin (10 μg), chloramphenicol (30 μg), erythromycin
(15 μg), gentamicin (10 μg), oxacillin (1 μg), streptomy-
cin (1 μg), enrofloxacin (5 μg), penicillin (10 μg), tetra-
cycline (30 μg), and vancomycin (30 μg). Assessment of
the inhibition halos was performed according to the
guidelines provided by the Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute 2003).

DNA extraction and genotypic characterization
of Staphylococcus aureus

Isolates were grown in BHI broth at 37 °C for 24 h, and 1 mL
of each culture was transferred to sterile 1.5 mL tubes, and
genomic DNA was extracted using the Wizard Genomic DNA
Purification Kit (PROMEGA, Madison, WI, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.

S. aureus isolates were further characterized by PCR am-
plification of the S. aureus-specific femA gene (Johnson et al.
1995; Riyaz-Ul-Hassan et al. 2008). Each PCR reaction had a
final volume of 25 μL, containing 2.5 μL of 10× reaction
buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 500 mM KCl), 2 mM
MgCl2, 200 μM of each dNTP, 20 pmol of each primer
(Table 1), 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen,
Brazil), and 5 μL of template DNA (20 ng/μL). Cycling pa-
rameters were an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min,
followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min,
annealing at 57 °C for 2 min and extension at 72 °C for
1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The specific
PCR product had 132 base pairs.

Detection of the enterotoxin-encoding genes sea,
seb, sec, sed, see, and tst

Presence of genes encoding the enterotoxins Sea, Seb, Sec,
Sed, and See were detected by multiplex PCR using a previ-
ously described protocol (Becker et al. 1998). Multiplex PCR
was performed in a final volume of 50 μL with 5 μL of 10×

3 mM MgCl2, 160μ M of each dNTP, 20 pmol of each primer
(Table 1), 1.2 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Brazil),
and 5 μL of genomic DNA (20 ng/μL). Cycling parameters
were denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of
denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min
and extension at 72 °C for 2 min, and a final extension at
72 °C for 2 min. S. aureus strains ATCC 13565, ATCC
14458, ATCC 19095, ATCC 23235, and ATCC 27664, carry-
ing the genes sea, seb, sec, sed, andsee , respectively, were
obtained from the Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ, Rio
de Janeiro, Brazil) and used as positive controls.

The gene encoding TSST-1 (tst) was amplified by regular
(monoplex) PCR using the primers described by Mehrotra
et al. (2000). This gene was amplified in a 25-μL reaction
with 2.5 μL of 10× reaction buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8.3, 500 mM KCl), 2 mM MgCl2, 200 μM of each
dNTP, 20 pmol of each primer (Table 1), 2.5 U of Taq DNA
polymerase (Invitrogen, Brazil), and 5 μL of template DNA
(20 ng/μL). Cycling parameters included an initial denatur-
ation at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation
at 94 °C for 2 min, annealing at 57 °C for 2 min, extension at
72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min.

Briefly, amplification reactions were composed of 20 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mM KCl, 25 mM MgCl2, 10 μM of
each nucleotide, 10 pM of each primer (rRNA1 and rRNA2;
Table 1), and 5 U/μL of Taq polymerase in a final volume of
20 μL. Amplification parameters were initial denaturation at
94 °C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min,
55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, with a final extension at
72 °C for 4 min. PCR products were analyzed by 2% agarose
gel electrophoresis.

A dendrogram was generated using the Bionumerics soft-
ware (version 6.5) based on band-based similarity index (Dice
coefficient) with equal weighting for each typing system. The
discrimination index was calculated using the formula recom-
mended by Hunter and Gaston (1988). All isolates that pre-
sented similarity coefficient equal to or more than 0.94 (94%)
were considered as having the same ribotype.

Results

Subclinical mastitis was more frequently diagnosed than clin-
ical mastitis. Subclinical mastitis was diagnosed in 55.68%
among the 88 cows, which had 18.46% of their mammary
quarters affected (in a total of 352 quarters). Only 1.70% of
the mammary quarters had clinical mastitis.

We found 38 (43.18%) S. aureus isolates by amplification
of a 132 bp fragment of the femA gene that is a specific mo-
lecular marker for S. aureus (Johnson et al. 1995; Riyaz-Ul-
Hassan et al. 2008) in these 88 cows, 32 in cows with subclin-
ical mastitis and six in cows with clinical mastitis. These 38
S. aureus isolates were tested for resistance to 13 antibiotics
and the antimicrobial resistance profiles are presented on
Table 2. The most efficacious antimicrobial agents against

the isolates were gentamicin, amoxicillin, and norfloxacin.
Gentamicin was the most efficacious agent inhibiting
78.95% of the S. aureus isolates. The least efficacious were
penicillin, streptomycin, and ampicillin (Fig. 1).

Table 3 demonstrates that 25 out of the 38 S. aureus isolates
(65.78%) carried at least one of the toxin genes evaluated in
this study. Table 4 demonstrates the frequency of each of the
toxin genes. The icaD gene was detected in 14 isolates
(36.84%), followed by tst (26.31%), seb (7.89%), sec, and
sed (5.26%). sea, see, and icaA genes were not detected in
this study. Therefore, the biofilm-associated gene, icaD, and
the gene that encodes the TSST-1 toxin were detected with
higher frequencies. Somatic cell counts (SCC) are demonstrat-
ed in Table 5. SCC were measured in raw milk samples from
farms that were positive by CMT. Twenty-three isolates
belonged to farm B and 12 to farm C. In other words, 35 out
of the 38 S. aureus isolates belonged to the two farms with
highest SCC.

PCR-ribotyping analysis of S. aureus isolates revealed 21
different genotypes and a discriminatory capacity of 0.94
(D = 0.94). The most frequent ribotypes were 20, 16, and 3,
which included 6, 5, and 4 isolates, respectively. The remain-
ing 23 isolates were evenly distributed in 18 groups of smaller
size (Fig. 2). Interestingly, three S. aureus strains belonging to
ribotype 15 carried the virulence gene icaD. Figure 2 also
indicates the ribotypes isolated from clinical or subclinical
cases of mastitis.

lence factors in S. aureus strains isolated from cows with

pathogenesis of mastitis (Cramton et al. 1999). Little is known
about the pathogenesis of subclinical mastitis. Thus, our data
can help in prevention and control subclinical mastitis, de-
creasing the risk of spreading among cows in a given dairy
herd and consequently decreasing financial losses as well as
decreasing the risks for public health.

S. aureus cause important economic losses and represent a
potential risk to public health due to its capacity to produce
enterotoxin (Vicosa et al. 2010). S. aureus produces extracel-
lular toxins such as staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE) and toxic
shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1). We detected 38 S. aureus
strains; 25 strains (65.78%) were found to harbor toxin genes
as enterotoxin genes seb (7.89%), sec and sed (5.26% each),
and tst gene (26.31%), besides ica adhesion genes, icaD
(36.84%). Five strains possessed multiple toxin genes. Some
authors related that SE and tst genes are encoded in genomic
islands, such as pathogenicity islands, so some toxin genes
may travel together, but still the reason for this occurrence is
not known (Omoe et al. 2005).

S. aureus strains expressing SE genes were found with a
lower frequency in this study; interestingly, all seb and not sec
producers were TSST-1 positives differing of some studies
that related S. aureus strains produce sec and TSST-1, simul-
taneously (Akineden et al. 2001; El-Ghodban et al. 2006).
Although Zschock et al. (2004) relate that production of
TSST-1 is associated with clinical cases of mastitis by
S. aureus, Kuroishi et al. (2003) have demonstrated that sec
is of higher importance more than TSST-1 in the pathology of
staphylococcal mastitis. We diagnosed a larger number of
subclinical mastitis cases, which would explain the lower

for causing food poisoning in people, and the ica adhesion

incidence of isolates producing sec genes. We observed a
presence of 10 S. aureus isolates producing TSST-1 and only
two isolates with sec gene. There is a number limited of data
on the distribution of tst gene in subclinical mastitis by
S. aureus isolates. TSST-1 and enterotoxins are pyrogenic
toxin superantigens that cause intense effects on the host, so
it is essential to verify the presence of TSST-1 and SE pro-
duced by S. aureus in food sources (Farahmand-Azar et al.
2013). These toxins are considered like super antigenic toxins
those are able to induce immunosuppression in dairy cows,

which promotes the persistence of bacteria in host and con-
tributes to chronic mastitis (Omoe et al. 2003). However, the
role of virulence factors in bovine subclinical mastitis and the
importance of toxin produced by S. aureus for udder patho-
genesis are still poorly known (Schuberth et al. 2001).

The gene more prevalent in this study was ica adhesion
gene, the percentage of isolates producing icaD was
36.84%. Studies showed that S. aureus strains had no ability
to form biofilm unless they produce icaD gene (Namvar et al.
2013). The presence of biofilm genes is associated to

pathogenicity because it can contribute to the evasion of the
host immune defenses and to the difficulty of bacteria eradi-
cation. Some authors have related that Staphylococcus biofilm
is one of the major causes of chronic mastitis (Melchior et al.
2007). In addition, studies have associated the biofilm produc-
tion by bacteria to higher resistant to antimicrobials (Raza
et al. 2013; Stewart et al. 2009). Approximately 90% of
S. aureus strains obtained in our study demonstrated multiple
resistances to different antimicrobial agents. The indiscrimi-
nate use of antimicrobial in animal feed is implicated in the
increase of S. aureus strains resistant to antimicrobial agents,
increasing rates of human infection through contaminated
food. The emergence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus
(MRSA) infection in dairy animals is of great concern for
livestock and public health. The resistance of S. aureus is
becoming more complicated by changes in multi-drug resis-
tance mechanism (Wang et al. 2015).

S. aureus is one of the most common bacterium from sub-
clinical mastitis (Barkema et al. 2006). Subclinical mastitis do
not have obvious clinical symptoms such as fever and swell-
ing of the udder, as is observed in clinical mastitis. The sub-
clinical mastitis diagnosis is usually based in the California
mastitis test (CMT) and somatic cell count (SCC). There is an
important relationship between SCC and the milk production:
the cell count increases as production decreases due to the
occurrence of mastitis (Viguier et al. 2009). These facts may
hinder the diagnosis of subclinical mastitis causing persistence
and dissemination of the disease in dairy herds. So, additional
information about genetic and phenotypic variation of
S. aureus isolates involved in subclinical mastitis is of great
importance to prevent and control effectively.

In this study, we showed that most of the analyzed isolates
(65.78%) from cows with mastitis presented one or more vir-
ulence factors that can be related to antimicrobial resistance
and mainly to subclinical mastitis cases. In addition, three
S. aureus strains of subclinical mastitis belonging to a same
ribotype produced ica adhesion gene. This ribotype can be
associated to resistant bacteria strains. Molecular studies on
bovine S. aureus strains shown that there is a large number of
strains involved in bovine mastitis etiology worldwide
(Aarestrup et al. 1997; Kalorey et al. 2007). Our results can
help in the understanding of the relationship between viru-
lence factors and subclinical mastitis caused by different
S. aureus strains. However, further investigations about diver-
sity of S. aureus isolates and genes responsible for the patho-
genicity of subclinical mastitis are essential.
