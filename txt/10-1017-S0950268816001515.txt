SUMMARY

A total of 1145 samples were collected from chicken breeder farms, hatcheries, broiler farms, a
slaughterhouse and retail refrigerated chicken stores in an integrated broiler supply chain in
Guangdong Province, China, in 2013. One-hundred and two Salmonella enterica strains were
isolated and subjected to serotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, virulence proﬁle
determination and molecular subtyping by pulsed ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The
contamination rates in samples from breeder farms, hatcheries, broiler farms, the slaughterhouse
and retail stores were 1·46%, 4·31%, 7·00%, 62·86% and 54·67%, respectively. The isolated strains
of S. enterica belonged to 10 serotypes; most of them were S. Weltevreden (46·08%, 47/102) and
S. Agona (18·63%, 19/102). Isolates were frequently resistant to streptomycin (38·2%),
tetracycline (36·3%), sulﬁsoxazole (35·3%) and gentamicin (34·3%); 31·4% of isolates were
multidrug resistant. The isolates were screened for 10 virulence factors. The Salmonella
pathogenicity island genes avrA, ssaQ, mgtC, siiD, and sopB and the ﬁmbrial gene bcfC were
present in 100% of the strains. PFGE genotyping of the 102 S. enterica isolates yielded 24 PFGE
types at an 85% similarity threshold. The PFGE patterns show that the genotypes of S. enterica
in the production chain are very diverse, but some strains have 100% similarity in different parts
of the production chain, which indicates that some S. enterica persist throughout the broiler
supply chain.

Salmonella in the United States [1]. In China, analyst
estimates suggest that foodborne Salmonella causes

mal origin, fruits and vegetables [3].

and

sporadic

illness

Food of animal origin, especially poultry and poult-
ry products, is considered a major reservoir for many
serotypes of S. enterica, and human infection is often
attributed to consumption of contaminated poultry
products such as eggs and chicken [4]. Contamination
of chicken or chicken meat may occur throughout the
whole production chain and some important risk

2

factors for contamination at each stage of this process
have been identiﬁed. The risk factors include inad-
equate cleaning and disinfection of broiler rearing
houses, contamination of feed, and chicken produc-
tion process; these factors can be a signiﬁcant source
of pathogen contamination between carcasses [5]. To
our knowledge, S. enterica always exists in the alimen-
tary tract and reproductive system of carrier chickens.
Studies have demonstrated that S. enterica can be
spread from one broiler breeding ﬂock to seven broiler
ﬂocks and further to the abattoir, and can therefore be
transmitted to humans through contaminated chicken
production [6]. Reduction or elimination of S. enterica
in broiler supply chains, particularly in chicken pro-
ducts, is important to control this disease, and insights
into the occurrence of S. enterica and factors affecting
its prevalence are essential [7].

Chinese broiler production ranks second in the
world; ∼28 million tons of chicken are consumed in
China each year [8]. As one of the largest chicken-
consumption countries around the world, great atten-
tion should be paid to the dangers of S. enterica in
chicken via monitoring the prevalence of S. enterica
in whole broiler supply chain in China. However,
the dissemination of S. enterica through an integrated
broiler supply chain has not previously been studied
in China. Therefore, investigation of the prevalence
of S. enterica in a broiler supply chain will provide
valuable information for the effective prevention of
salmonellosis.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the preva-
lence of S. enterica throughout a broiler supply
chain in China, from breeder farms through to retail
stores, and to characterize the S. enterica isolates
from that broiler supply chain by determining the gen-
etic relationships, virulence proﬁles and antimicrobial
resistance patterns of the strains.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Sample collection

From July 2013 to December 2013, we chose a single
integration broiler supply chain to perform the sample
collection. The supply chain consisted of two breeder
farms and its two downstream chicken hatcheries, two
broiler farms, one slaughterhouse and ﬁve raw chicken
retail stores in Guangdong Province, China. The pro-
duction process was as follows, two breeder farms ran-
domly supplied hatching eggs to two hatcheries, and
the eggs were hatched there for 21 days. Thereafter,

the 1-day-old chicks were transferred randomly to
two broiler farms, after which the 6- to 7-week-old
broilers were transported to a single slaughterhouse
for processing. Slaughtered broilers were sent to the
subordinate ﬁve retail stores or other food enterprises.
In this study, a total of 1145 samples were collected
at ﬁve different stages of the broiler supply chain in-
cluding breeder farms (n = 480), hatcheries (n = 255),
broiler farms (n = 300), the slaughterhouse (n = 35)
and retail stores (n = 75). Samples from the chicken
farms were collected with sterile cloacal swabs, and
samples from the slaughterhouse and retail stores
were collected by washing intact whole chicken car-
casses. Rectal swabs were taken randomly from indi-
vidual healthy birds as described previously [9]. The
sampling was divided into three stages, with each
stage lasting 2 months. Monthly, every site (farm,
slaughterhouse or store) in each stage would randomly
collect samples on two occasions. In the ﬁrst stage,
samples were taken from the breeder farm and hatch-
ery; 50–70 samples were collected from a breeder farm
once, and 30–40 samples were collected from a hatch-
ery each time. In the second stage, 30–40 samples were
taken from a broiler farm each time. In the third stage,
samples were taken from the slaughterhouse and retail
store, with 5–10 collected from the slaughterhouse
each time and 10–15 from the retail store once.

Isolation, identiﬁcation, and serotyping of S. enterica
S. enterica isolation was performed as described previ-
ously [10, 11]. Brieﬂy, swabs were cultured in 9 ml sel-
enite cystine broth (Difco, USA) at 37 °C for 24 h,
then 100 µl aliquots of the broth were streaked onto
xylose lysine deoxycholate (XLD; Difco) plates and
incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, typical Salmonella col-
onies were seen. They were further identiﬁed using
API identiﬁcation kits (bioMérieux, France) and sero-
typed with commercial antiserum (S&A Reagents
Laboratory, Thailand). Serotype was assigned accord-
ing to the Kauffmann–White scheme [12]. For chicken
carcasses, a whole piece was placed in a plastic bag
and washed with 400 ml buffered peptone water
(Difco) at 37 °C in a water bath with shaking at
100 rpm for 6 h. After the pre-enrichment, 10 ml and
1 ml cultures were transferred to 100 ml each of tetra-
thionate (TT; Difco) and Rappaport–Vassiliadis (RV;
Difco) broth incubated at 42 °C for 24 h, respectively,
followed by streaking from TT onto xylose lysine ter-
gitol 4 (Difco) agar and from RV onto XLD agar
incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, presumptive Salmonella

colonies were seen. The following identiﬁcation and
serotyping were performed as described above.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

A total of 20 antimicrobial agents currently used in
veterinary and medical therapy were assessed accord-
ing to the Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion method by
using antibiotic discs (Oxoid, UK) [13]. S. enterica iso-
lates were tested with ampicillin (10 µg), amoxicillin
(20 µg), ceftriaxone (30 µg), cefoperazone (75 µg),
cefepime (30 μg), cefotaxime (30 µg), ceftazidime
(30 µg), imipenem (10 µg), gentamicin (10 µg), amika-
cin (30 µg), kanamycin (30 µg), streptomycin (10 µg),
tetracycline (30 µg), chloramphenicol (30 µg), nalidix-
ic acid (30 µg), ciproﬂoxacin (5 µg), oﬂoxacin (5 µg),
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (1·25/23·75 µg),
tri-
methoprim (5μg), and sulﬁsoxazole (300 µg). Escheri-
chia coli strain ATCC 25922 was used as a quality
control organism. The classes of resistance level were
deﬁned as described by the Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute and are indicated as susceptible
(S), intermediate (I) or resistant (R) [14].

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of virulence
genes

All isolates of S. enterica were screened for 10 viru-
lence genes by a PCR method. Primers used in this
study are listed in Table 1. Virulence determinants
for each strain analysed were categorized according
to their
location on the Salmonella genome:
Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPIs) (avrA, ssaQ,
mgtC, siiD, and sopB), prophages (gipA, sodC1, and
sopE), a plasmid (spvC), and a ﬁmbrial cluster
(bcfC). Genomic DNA was isolated with a Bacterial
Genomic DNA kit (Omega, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR cycling con-
ditions were: 5 min at 95 °C; 30 cycles of 40 s at
94 °C, 60 s at 55 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C; with a ﬁnal ex-
tension of 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were
analysed by electrophoresis and visualized under
ultraviolet light.

Pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis

Bio Science, USA) and analysed using BioNumerics
software (Applied Maths, Belgium). Brieﬂy, agarose-
embedded DNA was digested with 50 U XbaI
(TaKaRa, China) for 1·5–2 h in a water bath at
37 °C. Restriction fragments were separated by elec-
trophoresis in 0·5× TBE buffer at 14 °C for 18 h
using a Chef Mapper electrophoresis system with
pulse times of 2·16–63·8 s. S. enterica serotype
Braenderup H9812 was used as the molecular weight
size standard.

RESULTS
Isolation and serotype distribution of S. enterica
Of the 1145 collected samples, 102 were positive for S.
enterica, including seven (1·46%) of the 480 breeder
farm samples, 11 (4·31%) of the 255 hatchery samples,
21 (7·00%) of
the 300 broiler farm samples, 22
(62·86%) of the 35 slaughterhouse samples and 41
(54·67%) of the 75 retail store raw chicken samples.
Serotyping results revealed the presence of 10 different
serotypes with S. Weltevreden (n = 47) being domin-
ant, accounting for 46·08% of the isolates, followed
by S. Agona (n = 19, 18·63%), S. Meleagridis (n =
15, 14·71%), S. Enteritidis (n = 8, 7·84%) and other
serotypes (Table 2).

Antimicrobial resistance in S. enterica strains
Overall, 73 (71·5%) of the 102 strains analysed were
resistant to at least one antimicrobial drug of the 20
tested (Table 3). The most commonly observed
resistances were to streptomycin (38·2%),
tetra-
cycline (36·3%), sulﬁsoxazole (35·3%) and gentamicin
(34·3%). All isolates were susceptible to cefepime, cef-
tazidime, imipenem, and oﬂoxacin. The strains iso-
lated from the breeder farms were the most sensitive
to antibiotics; the highest resistance was to streptomy-
cin (28·6%). From hatcheries,
isolates were most
commonly resistant to nalidixic acid (72·7%) and
sulﬁsoxazole

14 distinct MDR patterns: S. Weltevreden (23 isolates
with eight different MDR patterns), S. Enteritidis
(seven isolates with four different MDR patterns), S.
Infantis (one isolate) and S. Rissen (one isolate).
The MDR pattern most frequently observed was
STR-GEN-KAN-TET-SUL-SXT-TMP-AMP-AMX-
CHL (46·9%), which was found in S. Weltevreden
(Table 4).

Detection of virulence genes

All the S. enterica isolates were positive in PCR tests for
the SPI genes avrA, ssaQ, mgtC, siiD, and sopB, and the
ﬁmbrial gene bcfC. Lower prevalences were observed
for sopE, sodC1, gipA and spvC genes (60%, 57%,
51% and 8%, respectively). The plasmid-borne virulence
gene spvC was only found in serovar S. Enteritidis

isolates. Virulence proﬁles of S. enterica strains showed
concordance with serotyping; Table 5 shows the data.

PFGE analysis

At an 85% pattern similarity threshold, PFGE pat-
terns from the 102 S. enterica isolates were grouped
into 24 clusters (A–X) (Fig. 1). These clusters showed
concordance with serotypes, antibiotic resistance
proﬁles and virulence proﬁles. The clusters included
S. Weltevreden (n = 47, clusters E–L), S. Agona (n
= 19, V–X), S. Meleagridis
(n = 15, Q–T), S.
Enteritidis (n = 8, P), S. Thompson (n = 4, N–O),
S. Senftenberg (n = 3, A–B), S. Derby (n = 3, U), S.
Stanley (n = 1, M), S. Infantis (n = 1, C), and S.
Rissen (n = 1, D). In the eight S. Weltevreden isolate
clusters, E, G and J were the largest and comprised
70·21% (n = 33) of
total number of S.
Weltevreden isolates. Cluster E included broiler
farm, slaughterhouse and retail store isolates. Cluster

the

G contained 12 isolates which originated only from
the slaughterhouse. Cluster J contained nine isolates,
eight of which originated from retail stores and one
from a broiler farm. The S. Agona isolates formed
three gene clusters, of which cluster X was the largest;
it included broiler farm, slaughterhouse and retail
store isolates. Furthermore, the broiler farm isolates
SA038, SA019, and SA031 had the same patterns, re-
spectively, as the retail store isolates SA087, SA072,
and SA085. The breeder farm isolate SA007 had the
same pattern as the retail store isolate SA078. The de-
tection of common PFGE proﬁles indicates that iso-
lates of S. enterica were present
the
integrated broiler supply chain and have the potential
for transmission from poultry products to humans.

Guangdong, China, in 2013, to assess the prevalence
of S. enterica in a single integrated broiler supply
chain; 102 S. enterica strains were isolated. The S.
enterica contamination rate signiﬁcantly increased
from breeder farm to slaughterhouse, similar to

reports from The Netherlands and the United States
[16, 17]. In the present study, 1·46% of the breeder
farm samples were contaminated with S. enterica,
compared to 5·5% in 2012 in Shandong Province
(China) [18] and 6·8% in the United States [19]; the

isolation rate from broiler farm samples was low. The
S. enterica isolation rate of 4·31% from hatchery sam-
ples and 7·00% from broiler farm samples was also
lower than that in other provinces of China and in
other countries [20–22]. However, the S. enterica con-
tamination rate in the slaughterhouse (62·86%) and re-
tail raw chicken stores (54·67%) was higher than those
reported in other provinces of China and in Western
countries [23–25]. The high contamination rates in
the consumer part of the supply chain show that
chicken products are likely to be an important vector
of S. enterica, and there may be a signiﬁcant hygienic
problem in this stages. Previous studies have shown
that continuous ‘silent’ circulation of S. enterica in
the broiler supply system poses a potential risk of
spread of S. enterica and spillover to humans [26,
27]. To deal with high contamination rates in slaugh-
terhouses and retail markets, better management and
improved hygiene are required in these environments,
such as reinforcing safeguards, disinfecting strictly,
and an all-in/all-out operation. Improved hygiene
management during transport of broilers can signiﬁ-
cantly reduce the risk of S. enterica contamination
of poultry meat [28]. In addition, vaccine has been
widely used in the prevention and treatment of infec-
tious diseases, universal vaccination may be such a
strategy to prevent the prevalence of S. enterica in
the farm, but there is no commercial Salmonella vac-
cine in China.

The

serotype distribution varied signiﬁcantly
throughout the supply chain, although S. enterica ser-
otypes Weltevreden and Agona were the most com-
mon serotypes, and were isolated from breeder
farms, broiler farms, the slaughterhouse and retail
stores. A previous study indicated that the distribution
of S. enterica serotypes in poultry may change geo-
graphically and temporally, and S. Enteritidis, S.
Typhimurium and S. Pullorum were the three most
common serotypes in China (2006–2012) [29]. The
reason for this difference from our study may be
that we only investigated a single production chain.
S. Weltevreden is one of
the top ten serotypes
implicated in human disease in Guangdong Province
[30]. It has long been a major problem associated
with meat products in South-East Asia and was also
reported as one of the major serotypes in humans in
Thailand [31, 32]. S. Weltevreden is an emerging
serotype associated with meat, seafood and plant
products in Western countries [33, 34]. In China, espe-
cially in the south, the combination of urban con-
sumer groups with large consumption of seafood

and poultry products suggests that government should
strengthen monitoring and prevention strategies for S.
Weltevreden.

[36], while

S. enterica isolates exhibited resistance to a wide
spectrum of antimicrobials including streptomycin
(38·2%), tetracycline (36·3%), sulﬁsoxazole (35·3%)
and gentamicin (34·3%). These ﬁndings agree with
previous reports on antibiotic resistance in chickens
[23, 35]. One potential explanation is that sulfona-
mides have been used for 30 years in human and vet-
erinary medicine
and
aminoglycosides have long been used as feed additives
for therapy, prophylaxis and growth promotion in
broiler production. Previous studies have reported a
correlation between the use of feed supplemented
with antibiotics and the development of MDR in
Enterobacteriaceae [37, 38]. Conversely, low levels of
resistance to cephalosporins were observed through-
out our study, which may be due to the limited use
of this class of antimicrobial agents in veterinary
medicine in China.

tetracyclines

The different antibiotic resistances observed in the
supply chain may be the result of the different types
and amounts of antibiotic use in each link of the
chain. Isolates from breeder farms did not have severe
antibiotic resistance, whereas the S. enterica isolated
from broiler farms had high resistance to antibiotics,
which may be a result of different management of bio-
security and hygiene. Breeder farm, broiler farm and
hatchery S. enterica serotype isolates are different
from each other, which might also be the reason for
different antibiotic resistances [11]. In our research,
67·65% (69/102) of the isolated strains were resistant
to at least one kind of antibiotic, while 48·04% of
the strains had 53 types of antibiotic resistance, in-
cluding some isolates resistant to 510 drugs. Such re-
sistance can be passed through the food chain to the
human population [39]. Eventually it can lead to mi-
crobial cross-resistance and a threat to human health
[40].

In the present study, ten potential virulence factor
genes were investigated. The virulence genes showing
the highest prevalence (100%) were avrA,
ssaQ,
mgtC, siiD, sopB and bcfC, which is consistent with
a recent study [41]. Our results indicated that patho-
genicity island (SPI1-5) and ﬁmbrial genes have high
genetic stability. SPIs play a key role in Salmonella
pathogenesis [42]. Fimbriae help Salmonella strains
adhere to animal cells and promote their colonization;
pretreatment of bacteria with antibodies speciﬁc to
types 1 and 3 ﬁmbriae increased mouse survival by

over 60% [43]. spvC was only found in serovar S.
Enteritidis. The prevalence of gipA, sodC1 and sopE
genes varied in different serotypes, but they were com-
mon in S. Weltevreden. Bacteriophages and plasmids
can horizontally transfer virulence genes [44]. In cer-
tain conditions, there is the possibility of S. enterica
strains acquiring virulence, which poses a risk to con-
sumers of contaminated food.

PFGE is the current easy and effective method to
assess relatedness in Salmonella isolates from different
sources [45]. We used PFGE to determine whether
serotype identiﬁcation by classical serotyping matched
the serotypes predicted based on a comparison of
PFGE types; the two datasets showed agreement.
We deduce that PFGE agrees with serotypes, antibi-
otic resistance proﬁles and virulence proﬁles. PFGE
ﬁngerprinting shows several retail store and slaughter-
house isolates that clustered with breeder farm and
broiler farm isolates. Cluster E, the largest PFGE clus-
ter, consisted of isolates from breeder farm, broiler
farm, slaughterhouse, and retail store samples, sug-
gesting a possible association between the isolates. A
number of
farms, broiler
farms, the slaughterhouse and retail stores had com-
mon PFGE patterns, suggesting that many MDR
and highly virulent strains are transmitted downwards
between stages of the production process. The 41
strains of S. enterica isolated from raw chicken retail
stores can be divided into 16 PFGE patterns, indicat-
ing that S. enterica contamination from retail store
sources is diverse and complicated.

from breeder

isolates

Some highly consistent PFGE patterns from differ-
ent sources, demonstrated that the propagation phe-
nomena of S. enterica clones through the broiler
supply chain is associated with the spread of resistance
genes and virulence genes. Whereas many PFGE pat-
terns were seen only in a single source, especially in
the slaughter and marketing stages, these results sug-
gest that slaughterhouses and retail stores are two
crucial points of S. enterica contamination and cross-
contamination in the broiler supply chain.

In conclusion, this study evaluated the prevalence
of S. enterica in an integrated broiler supply chain in
Guangdong, China. Our ﬁndings demonstrate that
S. enterica was transferred along the broiler supply
chain and from the breeder farm to retail stores.
However, the ﬂock or carcass cross-contamination of
S. enterica at one independent stage may be the deter-
minative factor for contamination. The slaughter-
house and retail raw chicken store stages were the
crucial
contamination.

for S.

points

Furthermore, S. Weltevreden was the most prominent
serotype and persisted throughout the broiler supply
chain. Many S. enterica isolates showed resistance to
multiple antibiotics and high levels of virulence
genes, increasing the need for the implementation of
control measures to reduce the spread of antimicrobial
resistance and virulence. This study will help strength-
en both the understanding and epidemiological sur-
veillance of S. enterica.
