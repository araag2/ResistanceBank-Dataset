ABSTRACT 

  
The occurrence of toxigenic Escherichia coli in raw milk cheese was surveyed in Middle Western Brazil. 
Fifty  samples  of  cheese  from  different  supermarkets  were  analyzed  for  E.coli.  The  isolates  were 
serotyped  and  screened  for  the  presence  of  verotoxigenic  E.  coli  (VTEC)  and  enterotoxigenic  E.  coli 
(ETEC)  by  Polymerase  Chain  Reaction  (PCR).  The  susceptibility  to  thirteen  antimicrobial  agents  was 
evaluated  by  the  disk  diffusion  method.  E.coli  were  recovered  from  48  (96.0%)  of  the  samples.  The 
serogroups identified were O125 (6.0%), O111 (4.0%), O55 (2.0%) and O119 (2.0%). Three (6.0%) and 
1(2.0%)  of  the  E.coli  isolates  were  VTEC  and  ETEC,  respectively.  Most  frequent  resistance  was 
observed  to  the  following  antimicrobials:  cephalothin  (60.0%),  nalidixic  acid  (40.0%),  doxycyclin 
(33.0%), tetracycline (31.0%) and ampicillin (29.0%).  
 
Pesquisou-se  a  ocorrência  de  Escherichia  coli  toxigênica,  em  queijo  produzido  com  leite  não 
pasteurizado, na Região Centro Oeste do Brazil. Foram utilizados 50 queijos adquiridos em diferentes 
supermercados.  As  amostras  isoladas  foram  classificadas  por  sorogrupo,  avaliadas  em  relação  à 
sensibilidade para 13 agentes antimicrobianos e submetidas à reação em cadeia da polimerase para a 
presença de genes característicos de E. coli verotoxigênica (VTEC) e enterotoxigênica (ETEC). E. coli 
foi  recuperada  em  48(96,0%)  dos  queijos.  Foram  identificados  os  sorogrupos  O125  (6,0%),  O111 
(4,0%), O55 (2,0%) e O119 (2,0%). Três (6,0%) amostras de E. coli foram classificadas como VTEC e 
uma (2,0%) como ETEC. Os maiores índices de resistência foram verificados para: cefalotina (60,0%), 
ácido nalidíxico (40,0%), doxiciclina (33,0%), tetraciclina (31,0%) e ampicilina (29,0%).

RESUMO 

INTRODUCTION 

 
Minas Frescal cheese is one of the most popular 
cheeses  produced  in  Brazil.  This  soft,  white 
cheese is made of pasteurized or raw milk. It is 
characterized  by  a  high  water  content  (43.0%) 
and  low  pH  (5.1-5.6)  (Freitas  et  al.,  1993).

(VTEC), 

After  an  outbreak  of  foodborne  disease  caused 
by enteropathogenic E. coli (Marier et al., 1973), 
the  presence  of  these  microorganisms  in  cheese 
acquired  additional  significance.  Toxigenic  E. 
coli  of  bovine  origin  has  been  classified  into 
three categories: enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), 
verotoxigenic 
and 
necrotoxigenic  E.  coli  (NTEC)  (Quinto  and 
Cepeda, 1997). The first group constitutes one of 
the  most  important  vectors  of  E.  coli  diarrhea, 
and is considered the major cause of diarrhea in 
children  in  developing  countries;  it  is  also  the 
most frequently etiological agent responsible for 
travellers׳  diarrhea  (Nataro  and  Kaper,  1998). 
ETEC  causes  diarrhea  by  adhering 
the 
intestinal  mucosa  by  their  unique  colonization 
factors, producing either heat-labile enterotoxins 
(LT-I  and  LT-II),  heat-stable  enterotoxins  (STa 
and STb), or both (Nataro and Kaper, 1998).  
 
Verocytotoxin  (VT)-producing  E.  coli  (VTEC) 
are a well recognized cause of severe disease in 
human  beings,  such  as  haemolytic  uraemic 
syndrome  (HUS).  While  numerous  outbreaks 
have  been  related  to  E.  coli  serotype  O157:H7, 
several  other  VTEC  serotypes  have  been 
associated  with  human  diseases  (Paton  and 
Paton,  1998).  Outbreaks  and  sporadic  cases  of 
illnesses  were  also  traced  to  consumption  of 
VTEC-contaminated  cheese  (Deschenes  et  al., 
1996).  
 
CNF-producing E. coli, known as necrotizing E. 
coli  (NTEC)  have  been  isolated  from  animals 
with  enteritis  (De  Rycke  et  al.,  1987),  however 
they have been rarely found in Brazil (Salvadori 
et al., 2003).  
 
Cattle are an important reservoir of toxigenic E. 
coli, and have been implicated as a source of E. 
coli  that  infect  and  cause  disease  in  human 
beings (Hornitzky et al, 2002). The aims of the 
present study were to determine the presence of 
ETEC  and  VTEC  in  soft  cheese  made  of  raw 
milk in Middle Western Brazil, and also to verify 
the  resistance  of  E.  coli  strains  to  antimicrobial 
agents. 
 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 
Fifty  samples  of  soft  cheese  made  of  raw  milk 
were  purchased  from  Araguaina  (Tocantins 
State,  Brazil)  city  supermarkets.  All  samples 

were  kept  under  refrigeration  in  plastic  bags; 
information  about  dates  of  production  and  of 
assigned  shelf  lives  were  not  presented.  Cheese 
samples  were  collected  over  a  period  of  six 
months  between  February  and  July  2003,  and 
were analyzed on the day of acquisition. Samples 
were  transported  under  refrigeration  (4-6oC)  in 
thermal  boxes  containing  ice  packs  and  were 
tested immediately after collection.  
 
A  25g  portion  of  each  cheese  was  blended  with 
225ml  of  nutrient  broth1  for  two  min  at  normal 
speed, using a Stomacher lab blender and incubated 
at  37oC  for  24h.  An  1ml  sample  of  the  nutrient 
broth  culture  was  mixed  with  9ml  of  MacConkey 
broth2  and  further  incubated  at  37oC  for  24h.  One 
loop of each tube was streaked on MacConkey agar. 
Four  colonies  from  each  plate  with  typical  E.  coli 
morphology  were  selected  and  examined  by 
biochemical  tests,  including  hydrogen  sulphide, 
citrate,  urease  and  indole  (Koneman  et  al.,  1997). 
Hundred  and  sixty  eight  E.  coli  strains  were 
isolated from fifty cheese samples, and one isolate 
from 
further 
characterization. A total of forty eight samples were 
studied  for  the  determination  of  O  antigens,  all E. 
coli  colonies  were  tested  for  slide  agglutination 
with  commercial  polyvalent  and  monovalent 
antisera3. 
 
The  antimicrobial  susceptibility  patterns  of  E.  coli 
strains  isolated  from  cheese  was  done  by  the  disk 
commercial  disks4, 
diffusion  method  using 
to 
according 
the  National 
Committee 
for  Clinical  Laboratory  Standards 
(Performance…,  2002),  testing  the  susceptibility 
against  13  antimicrobial  drugs.  Antimicrobial 
agents  tested,  loaded  on  the  disks  (concentration 
expressed  in  µg)  were  the  following:  ampicillin 
(AMP-10);  amikacin  (AMI-30);  nalidixic  acid 
(NAL-  30);  cephalothin  (CFL-  30);  cefotaxime 
(CTX-30); cefazolin (CFZ- 30); doxycyclin (DOX- 
30);  gentamicin  (GEN-10);  neomycin  (NEO-30); 
netilmicin 
(TET-30); 
tobramycin (TOB-10); trimethoprim (TRI-5). 
 
Bacterial  strains  were  overnight  grown  in  nutrient 
broth5 at 37oC. A 100µl sample of the culture was

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

results were reported by Araujo et al. (2002) who 
found  that  97.0%  of  soft  cheese  samples  from 
Rio  de  Janeiro,  Brazil,  contained  E.  coli  of  the 
same  serogroups,  among  others.  Serogroups 
O111  and  O119  have  been  recognized  as 
important  pathogens  in  Brazil  (Gomes  et  al, 
1991)  and  also  have  been  isolated  as  STEC 
strains from diarrheic and non-diarrheic calves in 
Brazil (Leomil et al., 2003; Irino et al, 2005). 

 
E. coli was isolated in 48 (96.0%) out of the 50 
tested  cheeses.  Forty  eight  strains  were  isolated 
and  7(14.0%)  were  identified  by  the  slide 
agglutination  serological  test  using  available 
polyvalent and monovalent antisera as pertaining 
to  serogroups  O125,  O111,  O55  and  O119 
(Table  2),  all  commonly  involved  in  human 
diseases  (Nataro  and  Kaper,  1998).  Similar

PCR  showed  that  2  isolates  (4.0%)  carried  the 
VT2  gene,  and  1  isolate  (2.0%)  the  VT1  gene 
(Table  2),  a  value  much  higher  than  0.4% 
registered  by  Quinto  and  Cepeda (1997) in soft 

cheese in Spain, but less than the 13.0% reported 
by  Vernozy-Rozand  et  al.  (2005)  in  French 
cheese. PCR of heat labile (LT-I and LT-II) and

showed  that  only  one  isolate  carried  the  LT-II 
gene while the ST gene was not found. Frank et 
al.  (1984)  reported  the  presence  of  3.2%  of 
ETEC  strains  in  milk  and  milk  products.  Soft 
and  semi-soft  cheese  have  been  previously 
associated  with  disease  outbreaks 
involving 
pathogenic strains of E. coli (MacDonald et al., 
1985;  Deschenes 
1996)  which 
demonstrated that contamination occurs at some 
point  during  cheese  production  and  processing. 
Experimental studies have already shown that E. 
coli O157 can survive during the manufacturing 
cheese 
process 
soft  Hispanic-type 
(Kasrazadeh  et  al.,  1995).  These 
findings 
indicate  that  food  of  animal  origin  may  be  a 
significant  source  of  pathogenic  species  of  E. 
coli. 
 
Most  frequent  resistance  was  observed  to  the 
following  antimicrobials:  cephalothin  (60.0%), 
nalidixic  acid  (40.0%),  doxycyclin  (33.0%), 
tetracycline  (31.0%)  and  ampicillin  (29.0%) 
(Table  3).  Zhao  et  al.  (2001)  examined  VTEC 
strains  from  humans,  animals  and  food,  and 
reported  a  high  antimicrobial  resistance 
to 
sulfamethoxazole 
streptomycin 
(43.0%),  tetracycline  (43.0%)  and  ampicillin 
(33.0%), and some of them were similar to those 
found in this study. Resistance to at least one of 
a series of tested antimicrobial agents was found 
in  83.0%  of  the  examined  isolates.  Khan  et  al. 
(2002)  reported  resistance  to  one  or  more 
antimicrobials  in  49.2%  of  the  VTEC strains in 
India,  moreover,  some  of  those  strains  showed 
multidrug-resistance. The high level of resistance 
may  be  a  consequence  of  the  abusive  use  of 
antimicrobials  in  animal  therapeutics  as  well  as 
in food additives used to promote animal growth. 
 
It is concluded that toxigenic E. coli may pass to 
the  milk  destined 
to  manufacture  cheese, 
surviving  in  soft  cheese  made  of  raw  milk, 
confirming  the  results  of  other  authors  (Quinto 
and Cepeda, 1997; Araujo et al., 2002; Vernozy-
Rozand  et  al.,  2005).  They  represent  a  health 
hazard and this suggests that soft cheese should 
be  considered  a  vehicle  for  the  transmission  of 
potentially pathogenic bacteria.
