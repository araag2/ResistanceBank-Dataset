Abstract
Background: Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) are among the leading global foodborne pathogens and a significant
public health threat. Their occurrence in animal reservoirs and their susceptibilities to commonly used antimicrobials
are poorly understood in developing countries. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence, determine
antimicrobial susceptibility and identify risk factors associated with NTS presence in laying hen farms in Uganda
through a cross-sectional study.
Results: Pooled faecal samples were collected from 237 laying hen farms and these were analysed for NTS following
standard laboratory procedures. In total, 49 farms (20.7%; 95% Confidence interval (CI): 15.6–25.6%) were positive for
NTS presence. Altogether, ten Salmonella serotypes were identified among the confirmed 78 isolates, and the predominant
serotypes were Salmonella Newport (30.8%), S. Hadar (14.1%), S. Aberdeen (12.8%), S. Heidelberg (12.8%), and S. Bolton (12.
8%). Phenotypic antimicrobial resistance was detected in 45(57.7%) of the isolates and the highest resistance was against
ciprofloxacin (50.0%) followed by sulphonamides (26.9%) and sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (7.7%). Resistance was
significantly associated with sampled districts (p = 0.034). Resistance to three or more drugs, multi-drug resistance (MDR)
was detected in 12 (15.4%) of the isolates, 9 (75%) of these were from Wakiso district. A multivariable logistic model
identified large farm size (OR = 7.0; 95% CI: 2.5–19.8) and the presence of other animal species on the farm (OR = 5.9;
95% CI: 2.1–16.1) as risk factors for NTS prevalence on farms. Having a separate house for birds newly brought to the
farms was found to be protective (OR = 0,4; 95% CI: 0.2–0.8).
Conclusion: This study has highlighted a high prevalence and diversity of NTS species in laying hen farms in Uganda
and identified associated risk factors. In addition, it has demonstrated high levels of antimicrobial resistance in isolates
of NTS. This could be because of overuse or misuse of antimicrobials in poultry production. Also importantly, the insights
provided in this study justifies a strong case for strengthening One Health practices and this will contribute to
the development of NTS control strategies at local, national and international levels.

[1–3]. A recent estimate of the global burden of NTS
morbidity and mortality showed that enteric NTS cause
93.8 million illnesses with 155,000 deaths annually, while
invasive NTS were estimated to cause 3.4 million cases
with 681,316 deaths annually [4–6]. African countries
have a relatively low level of reported NTS gastroenter-
itis, but a much higher level of invasive non-enteric NTS
infections, estimated at 227 cases per 100,000 persons
per year compared to the global average of 49 cases per
100,000 persons per year

salmonellosis makes Africa the leading continent with
invasive non-enteric NTS cases accounting for more
than half of the global cases [4]. In humans, many of the
gastroenteric infections caused by NTS are self-limiting,
and thus, many sporadic cases go unnoticed and/or
unreported. However, a serious aspect of this situation is
that some of the gastroenteric infections may develop
into bacteraemia, which is an emerging opportunistic in-
fection in individuals infected with HIV, the elderly and
in children [7, 8].

The reservoirs of food-borne NTS are often located in
the primary food animal production. Many of these zoo-
notic NTS are able to colonize the intestinal tract of a
variety of animal species, and in most of these cases, the
animals are healthy and asymptomatic. Faecally contami-
nated foodstuffs like meat, eggs, dairy products and
sometimes vegetables are the main sources of salmonel-
losis in humans [2, 3, 9, 10]. The dissemination of NTS
is also a growing concern due to increasing cases of drug
resistant isolates and their frequent carriage of transmis-
sible antimicrobial resistance genes. Even more worrying
is the rising occurrence of multidrug-resistant NTS, in-
cluding cases reported in some African countries [5, 11].
Because of multidrug-resistance, treatment with first line
drugs is often no longer an alternative, and this puts
pressure on the use of second or third line drugs. Some
limited studies in Africa on antimicrobial resistance in
NTS isolates from animal sources have been undertaken,
but with varying results [11–13].

zoonotic pathogens

factors and the environment

Many prevalence and risk factor studies of NTS in
layer and broiler populations have been conducted in
the USA and Europe [14–17]. A systematic review of
risk factors associated with laying hen farms identified
multiple risk factors related to biosecurity measures,
management
In
addition, developed countries have put in place monitor-
ing and surveillance systems for antimicrobial resistance
targeting important
like NTS.
Unfortunately, such systematic surveillance neither exist
for NTS nor other food-borne pathogens in most devel-
oping countries, including Uganda [19]. Consequently,
the role of poultry as a reservoir and source of NTS in
developing countries is poorly understood. Furthermore,
the development of antibiotic resistance of NTS to com-
monly used antibiotics in agricultural production needs
prompt
investigation, commencing with susceptibility
testing. The significant data gaps in developing countries
hinder development of effective control systems and
risk-mitigation strategies at multiple levels.

Since most human NTS infections originate from ani-
mal sources, prevention and control at pre-harvest level
in the primary production units is an effective way to
minimize NTS dissemination and transmission to
humans through the food chains [20–22]. The aim of

this study was to estimate the prevalence, test antimicro-
bial susceptibility and identify risk factors of NTS using
production and management information from a sample
of commercial laying chicken farms.

Methods
Study area and recruitment of farms
The study was carried out between June 2015 and Au-
gust 2016 in the districts of Wakiso, Masaka and Lira in
Uganda. Wakiso district (00°24′N, 32° 29′E) and Masaka
district (00° 30′S, 31° 45′E) are located in the central re-
gion of Uganda, while Lira district is located in northern
region of Uganda (02°20′N, 33°06′E). These districts
were purposively selected because of their high commer-
cial poultry households that make them the hub of
poultry industry in Uganda. The sampling frame was
generated from a list of farmers participating in National
Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS) program in the
three selected districts of Uganda. In Uganda, the major-
ity of poultry farmers are smallholders, and therefore the
inclusion criterion was that for a farm to participate, it
should have a minimum number of 50 chicken. A sam-
ple size calculator, FreeCalc sample size calculation for
imperfect tests (www.epitools.ausvet.com.au, accessed on
3rd, June, 2015) was used. The required sample size for
demonstrating disease freedom was calculated as previ-
ously described [23, 24]. The calculator had the follow-
ing input; population size (Masaka = 147, Lira = 145,
Wakiso = 77), sensitivity (60%), specificity (100%), design
prevalence (5%), and the desired type 1 and type 2 errors
were all assumed at 0.05. Because of small populations,
the modified hypergeometric option was used. A total
sample size of 237 (Masaka = 85, Lira = 84, Wakiso = 68)
was
individual districts. Computer-
generated random numbers were used to select farms.
After selection,
farmers (respondents) were asked for
their cooperation and willingness to participate, and
after that a verbal consent was obtained. Those who
were not willing to participate were replaced by random
selection of others from the same list. Questionnaires
were administered to all participating farms and faecal
samples were taken for bacteriological analysis.

calculated for

Sample collection
Flocks and poultry house sizes varied a lot in the study
areas; and because of this, the sampling scheme was
standardized. In cases where a farm had more than one
poultry house, but with the same age group of birds in
each house, one house was randomly selected and sam-
pled. On the other hand, if a farm had more than one
house but with different age groups, all the houses were
sampled. Each house was divided into sectors of about
5 m by 5 m (25 m2), an approach adapted from previous
studies [25, 26]. One sample was collected from each

sector using sterile gloves and boot swabs. The samples
from each house were pooled together, transferred to a
properly labelled sterile container and put in a cool box
with ice packs. The samples were transported to the
laboratory within less than 8 h and processing began
immediately. All flocks were sampled once.

Bacterial diagnostics and identification of Salmonella
serotypes
Culture and isolation of Salmonella spp. followed stand-
ard procedures according to ISO 6579:2002/Amd 1:2007
Annex D: Detection of Salmonella spp. in animal faeces
and in environmental samples from the primary production
[27]. Briefly, pooled samples were homogenized, 25 g
weighed and added to 225 ml of Buffered Peptone Water
(BPW) for pre-enrichment and incubated for 20 h at
37 °C. The culture obtained was subjected to selective
Modified Semisolid Rappaport Vassiliadis (MSRV) agar
plates and incubated at 41.5 °C for 24–48 h. One colony
from each culture indicative of NTS was further plated
on selective Xylose Lysine Deoxycholate (XLD) agar and
incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Presumptive NTS colonies
were stored at −20 °C in Mueller-Hinton agar. The sam-
ples were later transported to Norway where they were
sub-cultured on blood agar plates and stored at 4 °C.
Biochemical confirmatory tests were done by using the
API-20E (BioMerieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France) identifica-
tion system. All isolates were serotyped according to the
Kauffman–White–Le–Minor technique [28] at the Nor-
wegian Veterinary Institute.

Antibiotic susceptibility testing
Antibiotic susceptibility testing of all identified isolates was
performed on 13 antibiotics (NEO-SENSITABS™, Rosco,
Denmark) using the standard Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion
methods on Muller-Hinton agar. Interpretation of sensitive
(S), intermediate (I) or resistant (R) was done according to
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [29], except for
ciprofloxacin (CIPR1μg) which was interpreted using CLSI
[30]. The 13 antibiotics were selected based on the com-
mon antibiotics used in Uganda and those recommended
by World Health Organization (WHO) for routine inte-
grated antimicrobial resistance monitoring [31]. These
were gentamycin (GEN10μg), sulfonamide (SULFA240μg),
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SxT 25 μg), ciprofloxacin
(CIPR1μg), cefotaxime (CTX 30 μg), meropenem (MPR
10 μg), chloramphenicol (CLR30μg), ceftazidime (CAZ30
μg), ampicillin (AMP10μg), amoxycillin clavulanic acid
(AMC30μg), trimethoprim (TRIM5μg), tetracycline (TET
30μg), and enrofloxacin (ENROF10μg). Escherichia coli
ATCC 25922 was used as quality control. NTS isolates
showing resistance to three or more antibiotics were classi-
fied as multidrug-resistant.

Questionnaire administration
All questionnaires were directly administered onsite
after pre-testing. Pre-testing of the questionnaire was
done by three trained research assistants in neighbour-
ing districts of Kampala and Mukono in central Uganda
and Kole in northern Uganda. These districts have simi-
lar production and management systems to the study
districts. After pre-testing, the research team reviewed
the questionnaires before final administration. The final
questionnaire had 80% close-ended questions and was
used to collect variables to determine risk factors. The
questionnaires collected information on general
farm
management practices
and characteristics, disease
prevention, control and management as well as demo-
graphic data of the farmers and managers. The question-
naire was written in English, but the research assistants
would determine whether the respondent was compe-
tent in English or not. Where the respondent was not
competent
the research assistant would
translate in the local language of Luganda (in the case of
Wakiso and Masaka districts) and Lwo (in the case of
Lira district). The selected households were identified
with the help of the local veterinary personnel and chair-
persons of local council one. Local council one is the
smallest administrative unit in Uganda. Data entry was
done by a trained assistant at the College of Veterinary
Medicine, Animal Resources and Biosecurity, Makerere
University, Kampala, Uganda.

Data management and analysis
After establishing the database, data were exported to
the Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS, ver-
sion 20) computer program for further data analyses. A
farm was considered positive if one of the pooled faecal
samples taken tested positive for NTS. An initial de-
scriptive statistics using tables and chi-square testing
was performed to assess the association of each variable
independently. This was followed by a multivariable
logistic model built based upon variables with p-values
< 0.20 in the initial analyses. All candidate variables were
tested for collinearity with other variables using tabula-
tion, and if collinearity was found, the most biologically
relevant variable was chosen. The model was built utiliz-
ing a backward selection among the candidate variables
(p < 0.20 from initial analyses) strategy using the Likeli-
hood Ratio test with for comparing models [32]. The
final model was assessed for fit using the Hosmer-
Lemeshow test [33].

Results
Number of samples, NTS prevalence and serotypes
A total of 237 farms participated in the study (Wakiso,
n = 68; Lira, n = 84; Masaka, n = 85). Sampling according
to the standardized sampling scheme resulted in 366

pooled samples from the 237 farms. Of the 237 farms,
49 (20.7%; 95% CI = 15.6,-25.6%) were positive for NTS.
Salmonella isolates were recovered from 78 of the 366
samples (21.3%).

Ten Salmonella serotypes were identified from the 78
isolates recovered (Table 1). Of the 49 NTS-positive
farms, five farms were contaminated with two different
serotypes. All these farms had three or more poultry
houses and the serotypes were from different houses.
The farms were from the two districts of Wakiso and
Masaka representing the central part of Uganda.

Antimicrobial susceptibility of NTS
Forty five, 57.7% (95% CI: 47.4–67.9%) of the 78 isolates
were resistant to at least one antibiotic in the disc diffusion
test. Resistance varied significantly by district (p = 0.034);
highest in Wakiso with 75.9% of the isolates from the
district resistant to at least one of the tested antibiotics;
this was followed by Lira with 52.0% and Masaka with
41.7% of the isolates resistant. The highest resistance was
against ciprofloxacin (50.0% of the isolates) followed by
sulphonamide
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim
(7.7%), trimethoprim (7.7%), and tetracycline (5.1%), then
ampicillin (5.1%), chloramphenicol (5.1%), and enrofloxa-
cin (5.1%). All the isolates were susceptible to meropenem,
gentamycin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, and
cefotaxime. Multidrug-resistance was seen in 12 (15.4%) of
the isolates and five multidrug-resistant phenotypes were
identified (Table 2).

A final multivariable logistic model

identified some
risk factors for presence of Salmonella spp. (Table 4).
Due to collinearity between some variables,
type of
poultry house and number of houses were dropped (col-
linear with farm size). Having a written biosecurity plan,
and having a separate house for sick birds were also
dropped (collinear with having a separate house for new
chicken). The final multivariate logistic model found that
larger farms had significantly more NTS. Similarly, pres-
ence of other livestock species like cattle, goats, sheep,
pigs were significantly associated with presence of NTS
(Table 4). Another variable that came out to be associ-
ated with presence of NTS was keeping of records. On
the other hand, the use of separate houses for birds
newly brought into the farms reduced the probability for
presence of NTS. The model fit was, however, limited,
as shown by the Hosmer Lemeshow test (p < 0.05).

Discussion
This study represents, to our knowledge, the first esti-
mate of the prevalence of NTS in laying hen farms in
Uganda. NTS prevalence was estimated at 21% of the
identified. High
farms with ten different
phenotypic resistance
found
among the isolates with almost 58% of the isolates found
resistant. In this study, the logistic regression model
identified large farm size, presence of other poultry, and
keeping of records as factors associated with occurrence
of NTS in Uganda.

NTS prevalence of 21% is not surprisingly high consid-
ering how the poultry industry operates in the country,
where disease control efforts are poor and deficient. In
Uganda, chickens are not vaccinated against NTS. The
available vaccines is for fowl typhoid targeting Salmonella
Gallinarum and the protocol used is not ideal for identifi-
cation of S. Gallinarum. Vaccinations of poultry in Uganda
are not mandatory. Most commercial
layer hen farms
include fowl typhoid vaccinations in their routine vaccin-
ation schedules. A similar study in Senegal reported detec-
tion of NTS in faecal samples in 35.1% of farms [34] and
in Nigeria, a related study reported isolation of NTS in

12.5% of poultry droppings [35]. A more recent study in
Nigeria by Fagbamilla et al. [36] estimated NTS prevalence
of 43.6% in commercial poultry farms. In Algeria, a study
in laying hen flocks by Bouzidi et al. [37] found that eight
out 18 flocks were contaminated with NTS.

The identification of ten different serotypes can be
regarded as a manifestation of the heterogeneous reser-
voirs and sources of NTS contamination. S. Newport was
the most prevalent serotype, compared to the more com-
monly reported S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium in
poultry isolates [37–40]. All the NTS serotypes identified
in this study are zoonotic, and are known to have caused
human disease outbreaks elsewhere. Consequently, this
high prevalence of zoonotic NTS in the poultry reservoir
constitutes a public health threat. S. Typhimurium, S.
Newport, S. Hadar and S. Heidelberg have also been re-
ported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) as the most threatening serotypes to public health
because of their association with multidrug-resistance
[41]. S. Mbandaka has been reported in many poultry

products across the world [41–45]. A recent publication
by Afema et al. [40] reported detection of mainly S. Ken-
tucky, S. Heidelberg, S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium, and
S. Virchow from poultry faeces. Also another study by
Ikwap et al. [46] reported most of the serotypes of this
study in isolates from piggeries in Uganda.

Studies of antibacterial susceptibility in NTS from Af-
rican countries show highly variable results. An occur-
rence of almost 58% of isolates resistant to at least one
antibiotic, is higher than what was reported in a similar
study in Chad, that found overall resistance to 16 antibi-
otics tested at 33% [13]. However, it is lower compared
to a study in Sudan that reported antibiotic resistance in
NTS isolates at 98% [47] and similar to a more recent
one in Ghana that reported resistance at 60.6% [48]. In
Ethiopia, a study on NTS isolates from dairy cattle by
Eguale et al. [49] found resistance at 30%. This high level
of resistance could be associated with overuse and mis-
use of antibiotics in poultry farming. The significantly
higher resistance level of NTS from Wakiso, which is

the immediate district surrounding the capital Kampala
should be of concern. Kampala is the biggest hub of
trade and movements of people, animals and animal
products in the country, and resistant bacteria can po-
tentially spread from here to all regions in the country.

Multidrug-resistance was seen in S. Bolton, S. Mban-
daka, S. Hadar, and S. Newport isolates. High levels of
multidrug-resistance have been reported elsewhere in
Africa [11, 12, 48, 50]. The bacteria expressing resistance
towards antimicrobials of which some are commonly used
in humans and animals exposes a daunting challenge. In-
creasing development of antimicrobial resistance against
commonly used drugs like ciprofloxacin, tetracyclines,
sulphonamides
sulfamethoxazole_trimethoprim (co-tri-
moxazole) in Uganda poises a great threat to public health
and economy. Tetracyclines and sulphonamides are
among the most widely used drugs for treatment and
prophylaxis in food animals [51]. Increasing resistance
toward these antimicrobials will render them less available
leaving farmers with no cheaper options. In Uganda, cip-
rofloxacin is not licensed for use in poultry production,
but is widely used for treatment of many human infec-
tions,
including salmonellosis. The mechanisms behind
the observed high resistance to ciprofloxacin in this study
needs to be investigated.

Resistance to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (co-tri-
moxazole) was also seen in this study. Co-trimoxazole is a
drug that is used in Uganda for controlling opportunistic
infections in persons living with HIV/AIDS [52, 53]. This
causes concern as many of these patients will succumb to
opportunistic infections [52–54] and also considering that
most patients cannot afford other options of antimicrobials.
All
isolates were susceptible to the extended-spectrum
beta-lactams (meropenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime) that
were tested. Efforts should be put in place to maintain this
status. Strategies to reduce antimicrobial resistance in
Ugandan farm settings should focus on improving manage-
ment, biosecurity, and sensitization of key stakeholders
such as farmers, farm workers, policy makers, drug dealers,
animal health workers and veterinarians.

At univariate analysis, a number of demographic farm
management and production variables were associated
with occurrence of NTS on farms. The final logistic regres-
sion model built identified large farm size, presence of
other poultry species, and keeping of records as factors
associated with NTS in Uganda. The final model was also
tested for the random effect of village to assess the degree
of
independence. While initial analyses indicated that
village had some effect, the final model revealed no such
effect – indicating that the factors found were stable across
the study districts. A large farm was one of the risk factors
associated with NTS determined by the model. This is in
concordance with the fact that farm size has been signifi-
cantly associated with presence of NTS in studies

conducted in Britain [26], Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada,
and St. Lucia [55], France [15, 56] and Belgium [57]. A pre-
vious study of presence of NTS in layer and broiler flocks
in the Kampala region in Uganda by Nasinyama et al. [58]
identified bird type, flock size and downtime as significant
risk factors. In the Ugandan setting, bigger farms tend to
attract many activities; visitors and the obtaining of feeds,
feed ingredients, chickens and other supplies from mul-
tiple sources, many of which informal and unregulated.
Under these situations with low biosecurity practices,
keeping adequate hygiene standards can be difficult. In
addition, most routine operations like mixing of feeds,
feeding of birds, watering and vaccinations are manual re-
quiring many workers, some of them coming from outside
the farms. Some farms have a limited workforce and are
therefore less effective in keeping high standards of routine
hygienic practices. All these factors can be further compli-
cated by farms experiencing erratic outage of power and
water supplies. As a range of management factors are re-
lated to farm size, we may not have identified the most
biologically important causal factors.

The current study identified presence of other animal
species as another risk factor for NTS. When present on
farms, other animal species will most likely share water
feeds and space with the chicken and thereby increasing
the opportunities for the spread of the bacteria due to
direct or indirect contacts. The other animal species
may be reservoirs of NTS and thus, contribute to the
maintenance of high prevalence of NTS at a farm.

Surprisingly, keeping records emerged as a factor in-
creasing the risk of infection. This could be because in
Uganda record keeping is poor among smallholder
farmers, and this study found a significant association of
NTS with large farms. Keeping records is therefore prob-
ably correlating with large farms. It remains open if this
variable should be in the model, but leaving out this vari-
able did not affect the estimates for the other variable
much. The variable is therefore not considered to be a
confounder, but it may perhaps represent other factors.

Having separate housing for birds newly introduced in
the farm was associated with lower levels of NTS. The
lower level of NTS in farms using separate houses for new
chicken is as expected and may represent other factors re-
lated to general hygiene, potentially reducing the risk of
introduction and maintenance of NTS at farms. Normally
housing new birds separately provides an opportunity to
observe and provide timely treatment before they are
released to mix with other birds on the farms.

The prevalence estimate in the current study is associ-
ated with several uncertainties. The study was a cross-
sectional study including only one sampling occasion
per farm. Depending on the infection levels, it is possible
that in some farms a small proportion of birds shed
NTS in faeces and this is normally intermittent [59].

this

Consequently, the prevalence and number of NTS in
faecal droppings may therefore change over time and
analysis of
requires a longitudinal monitoring
scheme. The sampling of faecal droppings only, in order
to determine the presence or absence of NTS, may be a
limiting factor as NTS in farm settings can be carried in
litter, feeds and water as well. However, pooled faecal
and environmental sampling of poultry houses is still
better than sampling individual birds for detection of
NTS on farms as reported in previous studies [60, 61].
In addition, this study targeted commercial egg laying
farms who are registered, and yet a lot of farmers are
not registered with NAADS. However, these results pro-
vide an important insight into the occurrence of NTS in
Ugandan poultry, particularly in the absence of previous
similar studies. In this study, data on the sources of day
old chicks were not captured and this could be included
in future studies of NTS in Uganda as sources of day old
chicks are potential risk factors for Salmonella.
In
addition, the sampling strategies limited identification of
more than one serotype in small farms with only one
house as only one sample was taken and one colony was
picked for serotyping.

Conclusions
A high prevalence and high levels of antimicrobial
resistant NTS in commercial laying chicken farms in
Uganda was revealed in this study. Large farms and
presence of other animal species at the farm were iden-
tified as risk factors for NTS. Both these risk factors are
associated with
challenges. Although
limited, this study should pave way for informing the
establishment of proper NTS control systems based on
empirical scientific evidence.

biosecurity

Further characterization of NTS from the poultry res-
ervoir that is documented through the present work will
be necessary in order to elucidate the transmission dy-
namics and dissemination of these important zoonotic
bacteria. Particular emphasis needs to be given to the
determination of antimicrobial resistance genes and their
mobility in future studies.
