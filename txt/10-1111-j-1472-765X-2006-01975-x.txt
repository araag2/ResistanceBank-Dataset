Abstract

Aims: (i) To study the occurrence of Escherichia coli serotype O157 in cattle
stool in West Bengal, India, and (ii) the virulence properties and antimicrobial
resistance of the E. coli isolates.
Methods and Results: Following enrichment in modiﬁed EC broth and plating
onto HiCrome MS.O157 agar, a total of 14 strains of E. coli serotype O157 was
isolated from faecal samples from two (2.04%) slaughtered cattle and six
(7.59%) diarrhoeic calves. By multiplex PCR, Shiga toxin genes were detected
in all the isolates. The enterohaemolysin phenotype was found in all, but one
strain. Among 14 strains, ten were resistant to at least one of the antimicrobial
agents tested. Multiple antibiotic resistance was frequent.
Conclusions: The study showed that occurrence of Shiga toxin-producing and
multiple antibiotic-resistant E. coli O157 among cattle population in this region
of India is signiﬁcant.
Signiﬁcance and Impact of the Study: Considering routine human contacts
with cattle, a large human population in this region may be at risk for expo-
sure to Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O157.

Introduction

Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) have drawn
wide attention as a causative agent of foodborne diar-
rhoea, haemorrhagic colitis (HC) and fatal haemolytic
uraemic syndrome (HUS). Among various STEC sero-
types, E. coli O157 is one of
the most predominant
human pathogens in many parts of the world and is com-
monly associated with large outbreaks (Grifﬁn and Tauxe
1991; Armstrong et al. 1996; Paton and Paton 1998). In
many cases, the infection has been linked to foods of cat-
tle origin or contact with cattle (Grifﬁn and Tauxe 1991;
Armstrong et al. 1996). Cattle are the principal reservoir
of STEC strains,
including those belonging to serotype
O157 (Armstrong et al. 1996; Chapman et al. 1997). Field
surveys identiﬁed that about 0.3% to over 15% of cattle
in North America and some parts of European and Asian

countries are carriers of E. coli O157 (Grifﬁn and Tauxe
1991; Armstrong et al. 1996; Blanco et al. 1996; Chapman
et al. 1997; Sekiya 1997).

Literature on prevalence of E. coli O157 in India are
very sparse. Excepting in sporadic cases (Gupta et al.
1992), E. coli O157 has not been identiﬁed as an aetio-
logical agent of human diarrhoea (Bhan et al. 1989;
Dutta et al. 2000; Khan et al. 2002a; Chattopadhyay
et al. 2003). However,
the serotype has been isolated
from foods of cattle origin, namely, raw minced beef
samples (9%, n ¼ 22) (Dutta et al. 2000), beef surface
swabs (3.7%, n ¼ 27) and milk samples (2.4%, n ¼ 81)
(Manna et al. 2006). The human diarrhoea isolates have
not been characterized (Gupta et al. 1992). All the food
isolates were
identiﬁed to carry Shiga toxin genes
(Dutta et al. 2000; Manna et al. 2006),
the principal
responsible for cytotoxicity to
virulence determinants

ileal epithelial and vascular endothelial
human colonic,
cells that
lead to diarrhoea, HC–HUS and thus were
potentially pathogenic. Recently, E. coli O157 has been
identiﬁed as one of
the predominant serotypes from
buffalo meat (Hazarika et al. 2004) and bovine and
ovine diarrhoea faecal samples (Wani et al. 2003) indi-
cating possible spread of the pathogen in India. Con-
sidering the presence of E. coli O157 in foods of cattle
origin but paucity of information on prevalence of this
serotype in cattle, this work was undertaken to investi-
gate the occurrence, virulence properties and antimicro-
bial susceptibility of E. coli
serotype O157 in stools
from slaughtered cattle and diarrhoeic calves.

Materials and methods

Faecal samples

All the samples were collected during March– August
2003. Rectal faecal samples (n ¼ 98) were collected from
adult cattle immediately after slaughter in abattoir at Kol-
kata, India. Diarrhoeic stool samples from calves, within
about 4 months of age, were also tested. About 15–30 g
of faeces was collected per rectum by ﬁnger palpation,
wearing sterile gloves from two state-owned dairy cattle
farms, namely Haringhata farm (n ¼ 24) and Kalyani
farm (n ¼ 17) in Nadia district near Kolkata, and from a
private farm (n ¼ 10) at Bandel in Hooghly district, West
Bengal, India. Faecal samples were also collected from 28
diarrhoeic calves that were brought by rural farmers to
Animal Health Centres for treatment in districts of West-
Midnapore and Hooghly, West Bengal. All the samples
were collected in sterile polypropylene containers, trans-
ported to the laboratory under ice cover and were proc-
essed within 4 h.

Isolation and identiﬁcation of Escherichia coli O157

About 10 g of faecal sample was enriched in 90 ml of EC
broth (DIFCO) supplemented with sodium novobiocin
)1) for 12–16 h at 37°C. The enriched culture
(18 mg l
medium was
streaked onto HiCrome MS.O157 agar
(HiMedia Laboratories, Mumbai,
India) supplemented
with potassium tellurite. Inoculated plates were incubated
at 37°C for 24 h. Sorbitol-negative and b-D-glucuroni-
dase-negative colourless colonies were further streaked
onto Levine EMB agar (DIFCO) for isolation in pure cul-
ture. The presumptive E. coli isolates were identiﬁed by
BIOLOG MicroLogTM automatic identiﬁcation system.
Serotyping of somatic antigen of the E. coli strains was
carried out at National Salmonella and Escherichia Cen-
tre, Central Research Institute (CRI), Kasauli, Himachal
Pradesh, India.

Detection of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli
haemolysin

The E. coli O157 strains were examined for phenotypic
expression of enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) haemo-
lysin (E-hly) following method described by Beutin et al.
(1989). Brieﬂy, bacterial isolates were streaked onto two
types of nutrient agar plates
supplemented with 5%
unwashed Sheep RBC (SRBC), and 5% washed SRBC and
10 mmol CaCl2. Characteristic narrow zone of haemolysis
on the washed SRBC-containing agar plates after 16 h but
not after 3 h of incubation at 37°C, combined with no
haemolysis on the unwashed SRBC-containing plates was
considered to be due to EHEC E-hly.

Detection of Shiga toxin-1 and Shiga toxin-2 genes

The test strains were grown overnight
in brain heart
infusion broth at 37°C. Bacteria were pelleted by centri-
fugation at 12 000 g for 1 min at 4°C. The pellet was
washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH
7Æ4 and ﬁnally it was dispersed in sterile distilled water,
vortexed and incubated at 100°C for 10 min to release
the DNA. The samples were then snap-cooled in ice,
centrifuged at 12 000 g for 1 min and 1-ll supernatant
of each sample was used for DNA ampliﬁcation. Multi-
plex PCR for detection of stx1 and stx2 (Shiga toxin
genes 1 and 2) gene sequences was performed following
methods and using oligonucleotide primers described by
Gannon et al. (1992). The ampliﬁed DNA fragments
were resolved by standard submarine gel electrophoresis
with 1Æ4% (w/v) agarose gel
in TBE buffer (89 mmol
Tris, 89 mmol boric acid, 2Æ5 mmol ethylenediamine-
tetraacetic acid). Gels were stained with ethidium bro-
)1) and visualized with Bio-Rad GelDoc
mide (0Æ5 lg ml
2000 imaging system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA, USA).

Antimicrobial resistance determination

Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed on Muel-
ler-Hinton agar plates by disc diffusion method (Bauer
et al. 1966) using antimicrobial discs from HiMedia.

Results

Occurrence of Escherichia coli O157

Examination of a total of 98 stool samples from slaugh-
tered cattle and 79 diarrhoeic faeces from the calves
revealed the presence of sorbitol-negative and b-D-glucu-
ronidase-negative E. coli. Slaughtered cattle and diarrhoeic
calves were sampled because previous studies indicated

that these animals are more likely to shed STEC than
healthy cattle in farm condition (Suthienkul et al. 1990;
Zhao et al. 1995; Blanco et al. 1996; Armstrong et al.
1996; Chapman et al. 1997). Serotyping of the E. coli iso-
lates identiﬁed E. coli serotype O157 strains from two
(2.04%) slaughtered cattle and six (7.59%) calves. In Kal-
yani farm, only one calf and in Haringhata farm, ﬁve
calves were found to be excreting the pathogen in their
stool. Presence of E. coli O157 could not be detected
among diarrhoeic calves in the private farm in Bandel
and those belonging to different rural farmers. Among six
positive calves shedding the pathogen,
four were aged
between 4 and 6 weeks and the other two between 11 and
12 weeks.

Virulence characteristics of Escherichia coli O157 isolates

A total of 14 strains of E. coli O157 were isolated in this
study. By multiplex PCR, the stx gene sequences were
detected in all the isolates: 12 (85.71%) isolates carried
stx2 gene only and two (14.28%) isolates had both the
stx1 and stx2 genes. The E-hly phenotype wasfound in all
but one E. coli O157 strains (Table 1).

Antimicrobial resistance

Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among E. coli O157
isolates is presented in Table 1. Among three isolates from
the slaughtered cattle, two were resistant to nitrofuranto-
in, tetracycline and co-trimoxazole. Resistance to gentami-
cin and norﬂoxacin was also recorded. Prevalence of
antimicrobial resistance was also common in the calf diar-
rhoea isolates. Excepting amikacin, chloramphenicol and
nalidixic acid resistance was recorded against all other
agents. One strain isolated from slaughtered cattle and
three strains from calf stools were however, susceptible to
all the antimicrobial agents tested. Overall, occurrence of
resistance was most frequent against nitrofurantoin (eight
strains) followed by co-trimoxazole (four strains), tetra-
cycline (three strains), ampicillin (three strains), gentami-
cin (two strains), norﬂoxacin (two strains), cephalothin
and ciproﬂoxacin (one strain each). Ten (71.43%) isolates
were resistant to at least one of the antimicrobial agents
tested: two (14.28%) isolates were resistant to one anti-
bacterial compound, three (21.43%) isolates were resistant
to three compounds, four (28.57%) isolates were resistant
to four compounds and one (7.14%) isolate showed
resistance to ﬁve antimicrobial agents.

Discussion

Cattle are the major reservoir of E. coli serogroup O157
and frequently identiﬁed as direct or indirect sources of
infection to man. In the present study, two (2.04%) of the
slaughtered cattle and six (7.59%) diarrhoeic calves were
found to be the carriers of this serotype. Distribution fre-
quency of positive faecal samples showed that E. coli O157
strains were isolated from two organized herds located in
Nadia district, but none from diarrhoeic calves belonging
to different farmers and private farms in the other two
districts of West Bengal. This is in contrast to previous
studies that could not detect presence of this serotype in a
total of 428 cattle faecal samples examined from same
dairy cattle farms or semiurban community near Kolkata
(Pal et al. 1999; Khan et al. 2002a; Chattopadhyay et al.
2003). But, this supports the observation of Dutta et al.
(2000) that a small but signiﬁcant (3.28%) population of
diarrhoeic calves excrete E. coli O157 in these state-owned
farms. As this study targeted speciﬁc groups of animals
most suspected for excreting the pathogen, this prevalence
rate cannot be extrapolated for healthy cattle in farm or
amongst farmers. Unlike in developed countries, cattle
farming in India are household practice. Considering rout-
ine contacts with cattle in day-to-day life a large human
population in this region may be at risk.

Compared with the adult slaughtered cattle, occurrence
of E. coli O157 was more in diarrhoeic calves in this study.

E. coli O157 in cattle in West Bengal, India

S.K. Manna et al.

It was more prevalent in calves of about 4–6 weeks of age.
This is in agreement with earlier observations that carriage
rate and shedding of E. coli O157 in calves and heifers is
higher and longer than in adult cattle (Suthienkul et al.
1990; Zhao et al. 1995; Cray and Moon 1995; Rahn et al.
1997). Moreover, faecal samples from cases of gastroenter-
itis had higher incidence of contamination than non-
diarrhoeic faecal samples (Blanco et al. 1996; Richards
et al. 1998).
The most

important pathogenic features of E. coli
O157 are the production of Shiga toxins, called Stx1 and
Stx2 (Paton and Paton 1998). Multiplex PCR showed that
all the E. coli O157 strains carried the Shiga toxin gene
and majority of the isolates (12; 85.71%) had only stx2
gene. Stx2 is strongly cytotoxic to human renal microvas-
cular endothelial cells and STEC strains producing Stx2
only are more commonly associated with serious human
disease, than those producing Stx1 or both the toxins
(Paton and Paton 1998). Thus, majority of the strains
isolated in the present
investigation were potentially
dangerous to human health.

Examination of phenotypic E-hly showed that all but
one of the E. coli O157 strains isolated in this study
expressed this cell-associated haemolysin. STEC strains
producing E-hly are more commonly associated with
human disease than strains that lack it (Schmidt et al.
1994; Gyles et al. 1998). The exact role of enterohaemoly-
sin in STEC infection is unknown; haemoglobin released
by its action may provide a source of iron for bacterial
growth in the intestine (Paton and Paton 1998).

The present study revealed high prevalence of antimi-
crobial resistance among the E. coli O157 isolates: ten
(71.4%) isolates were resistant to one or more antibiotics
tested. Even higher prevalence of antibacterial resistance
has been documented among non-O157 STEC isolates
from the same dairy cattle farms (Khan et al. 2002b;
Chattopadhyay et al. 2003). Likely explanation for this
high resistance is the frequent and nonjudicious therapeu-
tic use of antimicrobial compounds in the cattle in diar-
rhoea and other ailments. Oxytetracycline, gentamicin,
co-trimoxazole and ampicillin are the most
frequently
used antibacterials in the region and as expected, preval-
ence of resistance was high against all of them. Resistance
against norﬂoxacin and ciproﬂoxacin was also recorded.
This is in contrast to an earlier report (Dutta et al. 2000)
on the same dairy farms where all the calf E. coli O157
isolates were sensitive to gentamicin, norﬂoxacin and
ciproﬂoxacin indicating that
the bacteria have gained
resistance against these drugs in the last 5 years or so.
This is a possible consequence of frequent use of norﬂ-
oxacin, enroﬂoxacin and other quinolone derivatives in
cattle, swine and poultry husbandry, as well in human
practices. High prevalence of antimicrobial resistance may

confer advantage to the resistant E. coli O157 strains in
colonizing the intestinal
tract of cattle and thereby
increasing the incidences of faecal shedding during such
antimicrobial therapy. Moreover, resistance factors may
be transferred to susceptible population conferring resist-
ance to numerous antimicrobials.
