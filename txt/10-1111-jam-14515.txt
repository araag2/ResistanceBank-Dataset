Abstract

(1768%, 644/3642)

Aims: To investigate the prevalence and characteristics of Salmonella in pork
on sale in Wuhan, Central China.
Methods and Results: A total of 4744 pork samples were collected from retail
or wholesale markets in each season from 2016 to 2018. The samples showed
an overall Salmonella prevalence of 1954% (927/4744), among which the
samples collected in 2017 (2167%, 428/1975) possessed a signiﬁcantly higher
prevalence than those collected in 2016 (1861%, 209/1123) (P = 0047) or
2018 (1751%, 290/1656) (P = 0002), and the samples collected in winter
showed the lowest prevalence (1586%, 177/1116). The Salmonella prevalence
was signiﬁcantly higher among samples from retail markets (2568%, 283/1102)
(P = 0000). Antimicrobial
than wholesale markets
resistance of 922 Salmonella strains was tested by determining the minimal
inhibitory concentrations using a broth microdilution method. The strains
revealed that 9892% (912/922) were resistant
the
antimicrobial agents, and 8004% (738/922) were resistant to three or more
antimicrobials (MDR). Resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (8991%),
and ampicillin (7169%) was predominant. The
tetracycline
proportion of MDR strains in 2017 (9362%, 396/423) was signiﬁcantly higher
than that in 2016 (6316%, 132/209) (P = 0000) or 2018 (6966%, 202/290)
(P = 0000). No signiﬁcant difference was observed in the proportions of MDR
strains between wholesale markets (7607%, 213/280) and retail markets
(8053%, 517/642) (P = 0075). Multi-locus sequence typing for 554 of the
isolates
(STs), among which ST40
(3827%, 212/554), ST34 (1841%, 102/554) and ST469 (1446%, 79/554) were
dominant.
Conclusions: A high risk of Salmonella prevalence and antimicrobial resistance
was observed in pork in Wuhan. The risk varies between different sampling
years, seasons and market types.

Introduction

Salmonella is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that can
infect a wide range of hosts (Campos et al. 2019). It has

been recognized as one of the most important bacterial
pathogens causing foodborne illness worldwide,
leading
to millions of human infections or deaths (Oh and Park,
2017; Lamas et al. 2018). Food contamination is the main

route of Salmonella infection, which was estimated by the
World Health Organization, accounting for 643 million
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) through food con-
tamination alone (Kirk et al. 2015).

Salmonella is of high genetic diversity, comprising two
species Salmonella bongori and Salmonella enterica, of
which the latter consists of six subspecies. S. enterica
subsp. enterica, containing over 2600 serotypes, is of great
signiﬁcance for public health and veterinary clinics (Liu
et al., 2011; Gal-Mor et al. 2014). Serotyping of Sal-
monella strains was
traditionally performed by using
immunological approaches based on reactions to speciﬁc
surface antigens (Herrera-Leon et al. 2004; McQuiston
et al. 2004). Multiplex PCR assay has been developed for
simultaneous detection of different serovars (Jean-Gilles
Beaubrun et al. 2012; Park and Ricke, 2015). Multi-locus
sequence typing (MLST), which is based on the sequence
variations of multiple Salmonella housekeeping genes, has
been well-established and has been considered as a
replacement for Salmonella serotyping (Achtman et al.
2012; Ranieri et al. 2013; Cai et al. 2016). Currently,
whole-genome sequencing is becoming more and more
popular for Salmonella typing (Gimour et al. 2013; Ron-
holm et al. 2016; Ibrahim and Morin, 2018).

the issue of antimicrobial

Another concern regarding the risk of Salmonella in
food safety is
resistance.
Antimicrobial resistance has become a global problem
attracting unprecedented attention (Michael and Schwarz,
2016). Foodborne pathogens like Salmonella can directly
result in disease in humans. Once they become highly
resistant
their risk to public
health can be very high (Chang et al. 2016).

to antimicrobial agents,

The gastrointestinal tract of pigs is a common reser-
voir for Salmonella. Some nontyphoidal Salmonella can
colonize pigs without symptoms, but can cause gastroen-
teritis to humans. The prevalence of Salmonella in pig
samples varies
in different countries. Generally, Sal-
monella was detected at a higher prevalence in develop-
ing countries than in developed ones (Campos et al.
2019). In the EU in 2017, the overall Salmonella preva-
lence in pigs and pork was 127 and 158% respectively
(European Food Safety Authority and European Centre
for Disease Prevention and Control (EFSA and ECDC)
2018). However, the prevalence was shown to vary from
293 to 731% in Asian countries (Ma et al. 2017;
Patchanee et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2018). Even in some
high income countries, for example the United States,
the prevalence of Salmonella in faecal
from
swine reportedly reached up to 50% in sows and 35% in
market
swine (Campos et al. 2019). Moreover, Sal-
monella can be found in complex environmental and
ecological niches and even survive in harsh environments
(Yang et al. 2014a; Yang et al. 2014b). Consequently,

samples

Salmonella contamination may occur along the whole
pork production chain.

China is the biggest country in the world for pig farm-
ing as well as pork consumption. Therefore, it is of great
signiﬁcance to investigate the prevalence of Salmonella in
ﬁnished pork which can provide baseline data concerning
the risk of Salmonella to human. Several such studies
have been performed to investigate Salmonella contami-
nation in pork in China. The prevalence differs greatly as
revealed by these studies which range from 322 to 731%
(Ma et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2018). Moreover, there is no
study to investigate the Salmonella prevalence in mar-
keted pork in Central China, which is important pig
farming and pork supplying base. This
study was
designed to conduct a cross-sectional epidemiological
investigation on the prevalence and characteristics of Sal-
monella in pork on sale from 2016 to 2018 in Wuhan,
Central China.

Materials and methods

Sample collection and Salmonella isolation

The method for Salmonella isolation was modiﬁed
according to the Chinese National standard (GB4789.4-
2010). Pork samples (about 10 samples from each stall,
20 g of each sample) were collected from different mar-
kets in Wuhan at each season during 2016–2018, stored
in sterile tubes at 4°C and quickly delivered to the lab.
The samples were homogenized in 100 ml of buffered
peptone water medium and then incubated overnight at
37°C for pre-enrichment. The pre-enriched broths were
1 : 100 subcultured into 10 ml of tetrathionate broth,
which were cultured by shaking at 42°C for 18–24 h. The
genomic DNA was extracted from the enriched broths
(Naas et al. 2007), and used as the template for PCR
ampliﬁcation of invA gene (Rahh et al. 1992). The Sal-
monella positive broths were then streaked onto bismuth
sulﬁte agar plates which were incubated at 37°C for 24 h.
The positive Salmonella colonies were further detected
using PCR ampliﬁcation of invA gene. One Salmonella
isolate was obtained from each sample.

Antimicrobial resistance testing

Antimicrobial resistance was tested by determining mini-
mal
inhibitory concentration (MIC) values using the
broth microdilution method according to the guidelines
of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI,
2013). Eight antimicrobial agents were selected, including
ampicillin (AMP), cefotaxime (CEF), gentamicin (GEN),
amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC),
tetracycline (TET),
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim
ciproﬂoxacin

(CIP),

Salmonella contamination in pork

(SXT) and chloramphenicol (CHL), which represent eight
major classes of antimicrobial agents important to both
veterinary and human medicine. The isolates resistant to
at
least one antimicrobial agent were deﬁned to be
antimicrobial resistant (AMR) and those resistant to three
or more were deﬁned to be multi-drug-resistant (MDR).
Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was used as the quality con-
trol strain.

Multi-locus sequence typing
MLST of the Salmonella isolates collected during 2016–
2017 were performed according to the scheme published
on the MLST home page (http://enterobase.warwick.ac.
uk/species/senterica/allele_st_search). Brieﬂy, a fresh bac-
terial colony was
subjected to crude genomic DNA
extraction as described above which was used as a tem-
plate to amplify the seven Salmonella housekeeping genes
(aroC, dnaN, hemD, hisD, purE, sucA, thrA) using the
primers listed in Table 1. Based on the sequences of the
PCR products, the sequence types (STs) were identiﬁed
with MEGA software (ver. 5.0). eBURST was used to inves-
tigate the genetic relationship of STs.

Results

A total of 4744 pork samples collected from wholesale
and retail markets during 2016–2018 were subjected to
Salmonella detection. As shown in Table 2, the overall
Salmonella prevalence was 1954% (927/4744). The Sal-
monella prevalence was signiﬁcantly higher for the sam-
ples collected in 2017 (2167%, 428/1975) than in 2016
(1861%, 209/1123) (P = 0047) or 2018 (1751%, 290/
1656) (P = 0002); while no signiﬁcant difference was
observed between the prevalence of samples collected in
2016 and in 2018 (P> 005). In terms of different seasons,
the samples collected in winter showed the lowest Sal-
monella prevalence (1586%, 177/1116), which was signif-
icantly lower than those collected in spring (2194%, 249/
and autumn (2089%, 267/1278)

(P = 0002). Further analyses between pork samples from
different types of markets showed that the Salmonella
prevalence was
signiﬁcantly higher for retail markets
(2568%, 819/1102) than for wholesale markets (1768%,

higher among the strains isolated in samples collected
in 2017 than those in 2016 or 2018 (P < 005), suggest-
ing a higher prevalence of
resistance
among the strains from samples of 2017. The strains
isolated in winter were more frequently identiﬁed to be
MDR (9045%, 161/178);
those isolated in summer
showed the lowest MDR proportion (6468%, 152/235).
No signiﬁcant difference was observed regarding the
proportions of MDR strains between isolates
from

To accurately identify the Salmonella strains, all the
632 isolates obtained during 2016–2017 were subject to
MLST, among which 78 isolates could not be classiﬁed
into any ST. As shown in Fig. 2, a total of 20 STs were
identiﬁed for
the 554 isolates, among which ST40
(3827%, 212/554), ST34 (1841%, 102/554) and ST469
(1446%, 79/554) were dominant. A signiﬁcant difference
was observed between the prevalence of ST40 and ST34
(P = 0000), ST34 and ST469 (P = 0000), as well as
ST155 and ST543 (P = 0000) (Fig. 2). For the strains
belonging to these dominant STs,
the most prevalent
resistance was to TET and the least prevalent one was to

CEF (Table 3). The proportion of MDR strains among
the ST40 group was similar to that among the ST34 or
ST469 group (P > 005) (Table 3). Dominant MDR pat-
terns among ST40 and ST34 strains were AMP-GEN-
TET-SXT-CIP-CHL, AMP-TET-SXT-CHL and AMP-
GEN-TET-SXT-CHL; while the most frequently detected
MDR pattern among ST496 strains was AMP-TET-SXT,
followed by AMP-TET-SXT-CHL and AMP-TET-SXT-
CIP-CHL (Table 4). Strains from retail markets and
wholesale markets comprised 15 and 17 different STs
respectively (Fig. 3). Apart from that ST1249, ST1498
and ST434 were only detected in strains from retail mar-
kets, and that ST13, ST1543, ST358, ST489 and ST1628
were speciﬁc for wholesale market strains, the remaining
STs were identiﬁed in both retail market strains and
wholesale market strains (Fig. 3). The prevalence of ST34
among wholesale market strains was signiﬁcantly higher
than that among retail market strains (P = 0000); while
the prevalence of the other shared STs was not signiﬁ-
cantly different between strains from wholesale and retail
markets (P > 005).

Discussion

stage (slaughter) and postharvest

Salmonella-contaminated pork is one of
the leading
causes of foodborne illness. Salmonella contamination can
happen at several stages along the pork production chain,
including the preharvest (holding period on the farm),
harvest
stage (pork
preparation) (Bonardi, 2017; Campos et al. 2019). In this
study, we investigated the contamination of Salmonella
by collecting a total of 4744 pork samples from retail and
wholesale markets in Wuhan, Central China, in each sea-
son during 2016–2018. The overall prevalence of Sal-
monella was 1954%. Similar studies have been performed
in other regions of China which showed diverse out-
comes. Ma et al. (2017) reported that 322% of the pork
samples collected during 2015–2016 in Sichuan province
were positive for Salmonella. Zhang et al. (2018) reported
that 731% of the pork samples collected in Guangdong
province were shown to be Salmonella positive. These
results indicate that the prevalence differs among pro-
vinces in China. Moreover, compared with the situation
in EU countries where Salmonella surveillance and con-
trol programs have been established (European Food
Safety Authority and European Center
for Disease
Prevention and Control (EFSA and ECDC), 2018), the
Salmonella prevalence among pork samples in China was
very high, suggesting that effective measures for Sal-
monella control should be taken to decrease the risk of
Salmonella contamination.

Multi-drug resistance (MDR) patterns

different multi-drug resistant (MDR) patterns. AMP: ampicillin; CEF: cefotaxime; GEN: gentamicin; AMC: amoxicillin/clavulanic acid; TET: tetracy-

compared between samples from different years, seasons
and markets. It was revealed that the prevalence was
higher among samples collected in 2017 than that in
2016 or 2018. The samples collected in winter showed the
lowest Salmonella contamination proportion; while the
prevalence was signiﬁcantly higher among the samples
collected in spring and autumn, suggesting that season
may be an important factor determining the prevalence
of Salmonella. It was also observed that pork samples
from retail markets possessed a signiﬁcantly higher

prevalence of Salmonella than those from wholesale mar-
indicating that the environment may also be an
kets,
important
factor leading to Salmonella contamination.
This is supported by the previous study that Salmonella
in the environment can cause the contamination of pork
(Bonardi, 2017). It is also possible that the difference in
the prevalence of Salmonella between pork samples from
retail and wholesale markets was attributed to the differ-
ent origin of pig farms or slaughterhouses. This was sup-
ported by a study suggesting an association between loads

Sequence type

of Salmonella in pigs and contamination in carcasses
(Pesciaroli et al. 2017).

In this study, we successfully isolated 922 Salmonella
isolates from pork samples. Antimicrobial susceptibility
testing showed that the strains were of very high levels of
antimicrobial resistance, in which 9892% of them were
resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent, and up to
8004% of the strains were MDR. High-levels of antimi-
crobial resistance among pig Salmonella isolates have also

been reported in several other studies (Cai et al. 2016; Jiu
et al., 2017; Zhang et al. 2018). However, compared with
these studies, the overall antimicrobial resistance among
strains isolated in this study is even higher, indicating an
increasing AMR prevalence or a varied distribution
between different regions.

proportions of resistance to tetracycline and ampicillin
(Xu et al. 2019). It is worth noting that the overall MDR
proportion and resistance to some dominant individual
antimicrobial agents among strains isolated in 2017 are
signiﬁcantly higher than those in 2016 or 2018. More-
over, the strains isolated in winter revealed the highest
MDR proportion and the strains isolated in summer
exhibited the lowest MDR proportion. These differences
among different years and seasons may be related to the
utilization status of antimicrobials in pig husbandry and
veterinary clinics, which should be further investigated.

Further MLST analysis showed that an overall of 20
STs were identiﬁed, suggesting the high diversity of Sal-
monella in pork. Among them, ST40 (3827%), ST34
(1841%) and ST469 (1446%) were dominant. These
results are consistent with some other studies showing
that ST40 and ST34 are the most prevalent STs among
pig isolates in China (Ma et al. 2017). It is worth noting
that ST469, which has been spreading in European coun-
tries, is becoming more prevalent in pork samples from
its ﬁrst detection in China (Ma et al. 2017; Patchanee
et al. 2017). Our results also revealed that the ST distri-
butions were similar between strains from retail markets
and wholesale markets, except that ST34 was more preva-
lent among wholesale market strains, indicating similar
risk of Salmonella contamination between the two differ-
ent markets.

In conclusion, our results demonstrate high risk of
prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella in
pork for sale in Wuhan, Central China during 2016–
2018. Of the 3 years, the risk of prevalence and multi-
drug resistance was the highest in 2017. Among the four
seasons,
the lowest prevalence and highest multi-drug
resistance were both observed in winter. Pork from retail
markets possesses higher prevalence than that
from
wholesale markets, and there is no signiﬁcant difference
in antimicrobial resistance between samples from the two
types of markets.
