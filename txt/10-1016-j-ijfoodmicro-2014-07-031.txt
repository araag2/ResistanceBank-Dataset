Foodborne pathogens are a leading cause of illness and death, especially in developing countries. The problem is
exacerbated if bacteria attain multidrug resistance. Little is currently known about the extent of antibiotic resis-
tance in foodborne pathogens and the molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance in Africa. Therefore, the
current study was carried out to characterize, at the molecular level, the mechanism of multidrug resistance in
Salmonella enterica isolated from 1600 food samples (800 meat products and 800 dairy products) collected
from different street venders, butchers, retail markets and slaughterhouses in Egypt. Forty-seven out of 69 iso-
lates (68.1%) showed multidrug resistance phenotypes to at least three classes of antimicrobials. The incidence
of multidrug-resistant isolates was higher in meat products (37, 69.8%) than in dairy products (10, 62.5%). The
multidrug-resistant serovars included, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (24 isolates, 34.8%), S. enterica serovar
Enteritidis, (15 isolates, 21.8%), S. enterica serovar Infantis (7 isolates, 10.1%) and S. enterica non-typable serovar
(1 isolate, 1.4%). The highest resistance was to ampicillin (95.7%), then to kanamycin (93.6%), spectinomycin
(93.6%), streptomycin (91.5%) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (91.5%). PCR and DNA sequencing were
used to screen and characterize integrons and antibiotic resistance genes and 39.1% and 8.7% of isolates were pos-
itive for class 1 and class 2 integrons, respectively. β-lactamase-encoding genes were identiﬁed in 75.4% of iso-
lates and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes were identiﬁed in 27.5% of isolates. Finally, the
ﬂorphenicol resistance gene, ﬂoR, was identiﬁed in 18.8% of isolates. PCR screening identiﬁed S. enterica serovar
Typhimurium DT104 in both meat and dairy products. This is the ﬁrst study to report many of these resistance
genes in dairy products. This study highlights the high incidence of multidrug-resistant S. enterica in meat and
dairy products in Egypt, with the possibility of their transfer to humans leading to therapeutic failure. Therefore,
the overuse of antibiotics in animals should be drastically reduced in developing countries.

1. Introduction

Increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents remains a major
challenge to public health professionals in both developed and develop-
ing countries. However,
in developing countries, antimicrobial
resistance is exacerbated by over-prescription of antibiotics and
increased use in both human and animal healthcare. Furthermore, strat-
egies to combat and prevent resistance are not at the top of the list of
priorities in these countries (da Costa et al., 2013). More recently, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the USA estimates that,
in the USA, more than two million people are made ill every year with
antibiotic-resistant infections, with at least 23,000 dying as a result of
these infections (CDC, 2013). Food may act as a vector for the transfer
of antimicrobial resistant bacteria and antimicrobial resistance genes
to humans (Verraes et al., 2013). Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria

can spread to humans either via the food supply (e.g., meat, ﬁsh, eggs
and dairy products), direct contact with animals or, more indirectly,
through environmental pathways (Angulo et al., 2004). The conse-
quences of antimicrobial resistance are particularly important when
pathogens are resistant to antimicrobials that are critically important
in the treatment of human disease. This concern includes infections ac-
quired in hospitals, community infections acquired in outpatient care
settings, and also, resistant foodborne disease associated with drug
use in food-producing animals (WHO, 2009).

The spread of MDR bacteria via meat and dairy products poses seri-
ous public health concerns. In the United States, the newly-released
10th National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS)
report describes alarming increases in antibiotic-resistant bacteria
found on retail meats. The report also conﬁrmed that 80% of all antibi-
otics used in the United States are used not on humans but on food
animals, most of which are perfectly healthy (NARMS, 2011). The in-
creasing prevalence of multidrug resistance among Salmonella, not
only against the ﬁrst-line antibiotics, ampicillin, chloramphenicol and
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, but also, against clinically important

antimicrobial agents, such as ﬂuoroquinolones and third generation
cephalosporins, is also an emerging problem (Lunguya et al., 2013). In
developed countries, many surveys have been conducted at the molec-
ular level to monitor the incidence of MDR Salmonella enterica in meat
and dairy products (Ahmed et al., 2009a; Barlow and Gobius, 2006;
Clemente et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013; Mohamed et al., 2014; Thong and
Modarressi, 2011; Van Keesel et al., 2013; Wong and Chen, 2013;
Zhao et al., 2009). However, the extent of antibiotic resistance to
S. enterica in many developing countries and the molecular mechanisms
underlying this resistance remain unclear. The misuse of antibiotics in
humans and animals in these countries is not uncommon. Therefore,
the aim of this study was to perform a large scale survey to determine
the incidence of MDR strains of S. enterica isolated from meat and
dairy products in Egypt and to characterize the molecular mechanisms
of antimicrobial resistance.

and StCM-R primers, as described previously (Ahmed et al., 2013). The
PCR reaction products were subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.0% agarose
gel, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light. PCR
fragments were then puriﬁed from the agarose gel using a QIAquick Gel
Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Japan). Both DNA strands of the PCR product
were sequenced using an ABI automatic DNA sequencer (Model 373;
Perkin-Elmer).

2.5. Identiﬁcation of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 by PCR

The PCR ampliﬁcation of an internal segment of the 16S-to-23S
spacer region of bacterial rRNA genes (size = 162 bp) was used to
identify S. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 as previously described
(Pritchett et al., 2000).

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Bacterial isolates

A total of 69 isolates of S. enterica (28 isolates of S. enterica serovar
Typhimurium, 22 isolates of S. enterica serovar Enteritidis, 16 isolates
of S. enterica serovar Infantis and 3 isolates of non-typable serovars)
were used in this study. They were isolated in Egypt from 800 meat
products (480 beef and 320 chickens) and 800 dairy products (480
milk, 240 cheese and 80 yogurt) as previously described (Ahmed and
Shimamoto, 2014).

2.2. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

The antimicrobial sensitivity phenotypes of bacterial isolates were
determined using a Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion assay according to the
standards and interpretive criteria described by the Clinical and Labora-
tory Standards Institute (CLSI, 2011). The following antibiotics were
used: ampicillin (AMP), 10 μg; amoxicillin–clavulanic acid (AMC), 20/
10 μg; cefoxitin (FOX), 30 μg; cefotetan (CTT), 30 μg; cefotaxime
(CTX), 30 μg; cefpodoxime (CPD), 10 μg; ceftriaxone (CRO), 30 μg; az-
treonam (ATM), 30 μg; nalidixic acid (NAL), 30 μg; ciproﬂoxacin (CIP),
5 μg; chloramphenicol (CHL), 30 μg; gentamicin (GEN), 10 μg; kanamy-
cin (KAN), 30 μg; oxacillin (OXA) 30 μg; streptomycin (STR), 10 μg;
spectinomycin (SPX), 10 μg; sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SXT),
23.75/1.25 μg and tetracycline (TET), 30 μg. The disks were purchased
from Oxoid, UK, and the results were recorded based on CLSI guidelines
(CLSI, 2011). The reference strain, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, was
included as a quality control.

2.3. Bacterial DNA preparation

DNA was prepared using boiled lysates, as previously described
(Ahmed et al., 2009a). All selected single colonies were subcultured in
LB broth. An overnight bacterial culture (200 μl) was mixed with
800 μl of distilled water and boiled for 10 min. The resulting solution
was centrifuged and the supernatant used as the DNA template. DNA
template was stored at −20 °C until use.

2.4. PCR screening for integrons and antimicrobial resistance genes

Conserved primers were used for the detection and identiﬁcation of
class 1 and class 2 integrons as previously described (Ahmed et al.,
2013). PCR screening for TEM, SHV, CTX-M, OXA and CMY β-lactamase-
encoding genes was performed using universal primers for the TEM,
SHV, OXA, CTX-M and CMY families, as described previously (Ahmed
et al., 2013). Furthermore, PCR ampliﬁcation was used to screen for
plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, qnrA, qnrB, qnrS and
aac(6′)-Ib-cr, using previously described primers (Ahmed et al., 2013).
Finally, the ﬂorfenicol resistance gene, ﬂoR, was detected using StCM-L

2.6. Transconjugation experiments and plasmid incompatibility grouping

Transferability of plasmids was determined by mating-out assay
using S. enterica isolates as donors and a rifampicin-resistant mutant
of E. coli HB101 as a recipient as described previously (Ahmed et al.,
2013). Some S. enterica isolates which have no potent resistance gene
marker were not tested. Transconjugants were selected on agar
supplemented with 250 mg/l rifampicin and 100 mg/l ampicillin. Plas-
mid DNA was extracted from both S. enterica isolates and E. coli
transconjugants using the Kado and Liu method (Kado and Liu, 1981).
Plasmid incompatibility grouping was determined by PCR-based repli-
con typing as previously described (Carattoli et al., 2005). The transfer
of integrons and resistance genes was conﬁrmed by PCR assays on the
transconjugants as described previously (Ahmed et al., 2013).

2.7. Computer analysis of the sequence data

A similarity search was carried out using the BLAST program
available at the NCBI BLAST homepage (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Blast.cgi).

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Incidence of MDR S. enterica in meat and dairy products

The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria
constitute a threat to human health and present a major ﬁnancial bur-
den. Food is generally considered to be the most important vector for
the spread of resistance between humans and animals (WHO, 2007).
In this study 47 out of 69 isolates (68.1%) showed multidrug resistance
phenotypes to at least three classes of antimicrobials (Table 1). The in-
cidence of MDR isolates was higher in meat products (69.8%) than in
dairy products (62.5%). The MDR S. enterica serovars were: S. enterica
serovar Typhimurium (34.8%), S. enterica serovar Enteritidis, (21.8%),
S. enterica serovar Infantis (10.1%) and S. enterica non-typable serovar
(1.4%) (Table 1). The highest resistance was to ampicillin (95.7%),
then to kanamycin (93.6%), spectinomycin (93.6%), streptomycin
(91.5%) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (91.5%) (Table 1). Inter-
estingly, the results of multidrug resistance phenotypes in this study
are quite similar to that we previously reported in S. enterica isolated
from diarrheic calves in Egypt as 66.7% of S. enterica showed multidrug
resistance phenotypes to ampicillin, amoxicillin, streptomycin, specti-
nomycin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and kanamycin (Ahmed
et al., 2009b). Our results conﬁrm the high level of resistance to the tra-
ditional antibiotics used widely in Egypt. Unfortunately, in developing
countries, these antibiotics are widely used to treat diarrhea because
of their low cost and availability (Van et al., 2012).

3.2. Incidence of class 1 and class 2 integrons in S. enterica from meat and
dairy products

It is well known that genes encoding antimicrobial resistance are
often linked to mobile genetic elements. One of the most important ge-
netic elements responsible for spreading antimicrobial resistance genes
among bacteria is the integron (Mazel, 2006). Most integrons were
found to be located on plasmids and could be transferred to other
strains by conjugation (Van et al., 2012). In this study, PCR identiﬁed
class 1 integrons in 39.1% S. enterica isolates (Table 1). The incidence
of class 1 integrons was higher in meat products (39.6%) than in dairy
products (37.5%) (Table 1). DNA-sequencing results for the inserted
gene cassettes identiﬁed 12 types of class 1 integron with 16 different
antimicrobial resistance gene cassettes (Table 1). Our results relating
to the incidence of class 1 integrons are higher than those reported in
the USA, where only 15% of S. enterica serovars (including Typhimurium
and Enteritidis) isolated from retail meats harbored class 1 integrons
(Zhao et al., 2009). This incidence of class 1 integrons in dairy products
is signiﬁcantly higher than that recently reported for the USA by Van
Keesel et al. (2013), as class 1 integrons were identiﬁed in only 2.8% of
the MDR S. enterica isolates isolated from bulk milk and milk ﬁlters.
Class 2 integron is also an important vehicle for spreading antimicrobial
resistance genes in S. enterica strains (Ahmed et al., 2005). In this study,
PCR identiﬁed class 2 integrons in only 8.7% S. enterica isolates as fol-
lows: S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (4.4%) and S. enterica serovar
Enteritidis (4.4%) (Table 1). The incidence of class 2 integrons was
higher in meat products (9.4%) than in dairy products (6.2%). DNA-
sequencing results for the inserted gene cassettes identiﬁed three
types of class 2 integron (Table 1). In Egypt, class 2 integrons have
been reported previously in 5.4% of Gram-negative bacteria isolated
from bovine mastitis (Ahmed and Shimamoto, 2011). Interestingly, to
the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of the detection and
identiﬁcation of class 2 integrons in raw milk.

3.3. Incidence of β-lactamase-encoding genes in S. enterica from meat and
dairy products

Production of β-lactamases is considered the main mechanism of
resistance in Gram-negative bacteria to overcome penicillin-derived
(β-lactam) antibiotics. Resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalo-
sporins in S. enterica is a special concern, since these antimicrobials
are a front-line therapeutic for the treatment of numerous Gram-
negative infections (Bradford, 2001). In this study, PCR identiﬁed
β-lactamase-encoding genes in 75.4% S. enterica isolates. The inci-
dence of β-lactamase-encoding genes was very similar in meat prod-
ucts (75.5%) and dairy products (75.0%) (Table 1). These genes
include: blaTEM-1 (41.5%), blaCMY-2 (11.3%), blaCTX-M-3 and blaCTX-M-
15 (11.3%), blaSHV-12 (7.5%) and blaOXA-1 (3.7%) (Table 1). In China,
blaOXA-1 was the most commonly identiﬁed β-lactamase gene in
S. enterica isolates from pigs, ducks and chickens from abattoirs and
retail markets, followed by blaTEM-1, blaPSE-1 and blaCMY-2 (Li et al.,
2013). In Portugal, blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-14, blaCTX-M-15 and blaCTX-M-
32, blaSHV-12 and blaTEM-1 genes were detected in S. enterica isolates
from poultry, swine and food products of animal origin (bovine,
swine and poultry) (Clemente et al., 2013). In the USA, 11.4% of
S. enterica isolates isolated from bulk milk and milk ﬁlters were pos-
itive for blaCMY (Van Keesel et al., 2013).

3.4. Incidence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes in S. enterica
from meat and dairy products

Quinolones are used extensively in veterinary practice worldwide to
combat bacterial diseases. S. enterica with reduced susceptibility to cip-
roﬂoxacin is of serious concern as ﬂuoroquinolone (e.g., ciproﬂoxacin)
is the drug of ﬁrst choice for the treatment of invasive and systemic sal-
monellosis that occurs in humans and animals (Dimitrov et al., 2007). In

this study, the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes: qnrA,
qnrB, qnrS and aac(6′)-Ib-cr were identiﬁed in 28.3% of tested
S. enterica isolates from meat products. In Hong Kong, it was reported
that S. enterica strains isolated from retail meats with different resis-
tance proﬁles harbored plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes,
one carrying the qnrS gene and the other carrying qnrS and aac(6′)-Ib-
cr genes (Wong and Chen, 2013). In China, qnrA, qnrB, qnrS and
aac(6′)-Ib-cr genes were identiﬁed in S. enterica strains isolated from re-
tail foods (including chicken meat) with the incidence of 46.6%, 12.7%,
19.5% and 13.6%, respectively (Yang et al., 2013). In Colombia, qnrB
was identiﬁed in S. enterica strains isolated from retail meats (including
ground and chicken meats) (Karczmarczyk et al., 2010). Also qnrB, qnrS
and aac(6′)-Ib-cr were identiﬁed in 25% of tested S. enterica isolates
from dairy products. In Egypt, qnrA, qnrB, qnrS and aac(6′)-Ib-cr genes
were identiﬁed in 14.3% of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from bovine
mastitis (Ahmed and Shimamoto, 2011). It is well known that qnr genes
confer only low-level resistance to ﬂuoroquinolones and accumulations
of quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) mutations is neces-
sary for S. enterica to be resistant to ﬂuoroquinolone especially cipro-
ﬂoxacin (Eaves et al., 2004; Robicsek et al., 2006). To the best of our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of the detection and identiﬁcation of
plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes in S. enterica isolates
from dairy products.

3.5. Incidence of ﬂorfenicol resistance gene, ﬂoR, in S. enterica from meat
and dairy products

Florfenicol was approved by the FDA in 1996 for veterinary use in
food animals in the United States. Florfenicol is not approved for
human use; however, it is related to chloramphenicol and can select
for cross-resistance among bacterial pathogens. Florfenicol resistance
is mediated by the ﬂoR gene, which confers non-enzymatic cross-
resistance to chloramphenicol (White et al., 2000). In this study, PCR-
and DNA-sequence screening identiﬁed ﬂoR in 18.8% S. enterica isolates.
The incidence of ﬂoR was higher in dairy products (25.0%) than in meat
products (17.0%) (Table 1). In Malaysia, ﬂoR was detected in MDR
S. enterica strains isolated from meat products (raw beef, chicken meat
and street foods) (Thong and Modarressi, 2011). In Egypt, ﬂoR, has
been detected in 1% of S. enterica strains isolated from diseased broilers
(Ahmed and Shimamoto, 2012). Also, in this study, ﬂoR, was identiﬁed
in 25.0% of S. enterica strains isolated from dairy products. In Egypt,
ﬂoR, has been detected in 6.3% of Gram-negative bacteria isolated
from cases of bovine mastitis (Ahmed and Shimamoto, 2011). To the
best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of the detection and iden-
tiﬁcation of ﬂoR in dairy products.

3.6. Incidence of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 in meat and dairy
products

S. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 is a truly international
multiresistant clone of S. enterica that emerged in the UK in the early
1990s and then spread worldwide (Threlfall, 2000). S. enterica serovar
Typhimurium DT104 usually shows a pentadrug-resistance phenotype
to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulphonamides and tetra-
cyclines (ACSSuT resistance type). In this study, S. enterica serovar
Typhimurium DT104 was identiﬁed at high levels in beef (7.5%) and
also in cheese (6.3%) (Table 1). Our ﬁndings are very important from
the public health point of view as a beef-associated outbreak of
S. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 occurred in September–No-
vember 2005 in the Netherlands (Kivi et al., 2007). Also, an outbreak
of human salmonellosis caused by S. enterica serovar Typhimurium
DT104 occurred in Denmark between July and August 2005 due to
imported beef served as carpaccio (Ethelberg et al., 2007). Furthermore,
in the USA, numerous outbreaks of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium
DT104 have been associated with the consumption of raw-milk cheese
(Cody et al., 1999).

3.7. Transferability and replicon typing of plasmids

In this study, plasmid analysis showed that most of plasmid car-
rying integrons and resistance genes were conjugable with replicon
types: IncI1, IncA/C, IncHI1, IncN and IncL/M (Table 2). These types
of plasmid replicon are more frequently detected in plasmids
among Enterobacteriaceae and play a crucial role in spreading of spe-
ciﬁc resistance genes especially extended-spectrum β-lactamase
genes and acquired AmpC genes (Carattoli, 2011). Also, these types
of plasmid are considered to be “epidemic resistance plasmids”

that are being worldwide detected in Enterobacteriaceae of different
origins and sources (Carattoli, 2011).

4. Conclusions

Our study highlights the high incidence of MDR S. enterica in meat
and dairy products from Egypt and provides molecular characterization
of different mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance. Also, some resis-
tance genes were identiﬁed in dairy products for the ﬁrst time. Informa-
tion on antibiotic resistance phenotypes and genotypes of foodborne

pathogens in different countries and geographic regions is necessary to
track the change in resistance pattern and to follow changes in antimi-
crobial sensitivity patterns that may require a reassessment of treat-
ment and control strategy.
