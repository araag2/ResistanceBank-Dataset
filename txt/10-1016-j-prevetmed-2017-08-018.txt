The present study was conducted to determine the occurrence, serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance
of Salmonella serotypes in slaughtered cattle, slaughterhouse environment and retail beef. Cecal content (CC),
mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), spleen and carcass swab (CS) samples (each, n = 150) were collected from 150
cattle slaughtered at Hawassa municipality slaughterhouse. Floor swab specimens (SHFS) were collected on 11
occasions from the slaughterhouse, and 100 beef samples were collected from 100 butcher shops. The samples
were cultured for Salmonella, following standard procedures. A total of 14 Salmonella isolates belonging to 3
serotypes namely Salmonella enterica serotype Muenchen (4 isolates), S. enterica serotype 1,4,5,12:i:- (5) and S.
enterica serotype Korovi (5) were recovered. All of the 5 S. enterica serotype 1,4,5,12:i:- isolates belonged to
phage type 120. Four (2.7%) of the slaughtered cattle carried Salmonella in their CC and/or MLN, while none of
the spleen samples were positive for Salmonella. Salmonella was isolated from four (2.7%) CC and two (1.3%)
MLN samples. Out of the total of 150 CS samples, two (1.3%) were found contaminated with Salmonella, while 4
(4%) of the 100 beef samples obtained from butcher shops yielded Salmonella. Two of the 11 (18%) SHFS were
positive for Salmonella. All the four isolates from beef were S. enterica serotype Muenchen, while both of the
isolates from MLN were S. enterica serotype1,4,5,12:i:-. Both S. enterica serotype1,4,5,12:i:- and S. enterica ser-
otype Korovi were isolated from CC, CS and slaughterhouse environment. All the 14 isolates recovered during
the study were tested and found pan-susceptible to a panel of 14 antimicrobials. The present study helped to
update the information on the occurrence, serotype distribution and antibiogram of Salmonella in slaughter cattle
and beef in Ethiopia.

1. Introduction

Salmonellosis is among the main foodborne diseases in humans with
worldwide distribution. The global burden of non-typhoidal Salmonella
gastroenteritis has been estimated to be 93.8 million cases each year
with 155,000 deaths (Majowicz et al., 2010). Animals are the principal
reservoirs of Salmonella infection to humans (Acha and Szyfres, 2001;
EFSA/ECDC, 2014a) although foods of vegetable origin contaminated
by animal products, human excreta or contaminated utensils have been
implicated as the vehicle of human salmonellosis (Acha and Szyfres,
2001). Foods containing products from farm animals, including cattle,
are important sources of human Salmonella infections (Smerdon et al.,
2001; van Duijkeren et al., 2002). Beef has been implicated as a vehicle
of human infection in several outbreaks (CDC, 1995; Davies et al.,
1996; Roels et al., 1997). Contamination of carcass by Salmonella may
occur at abattoirs from carrier animals excreting/harboring the

organism (Samuel et al., 1980; Nabbut and Al-Nakhli, 1982; Morgan
et al., 1987; Berends et al., 1997; Arguello et al., 2012) and by con-
taminated abattoir equipment and utensils (Smeltzer et al., 1980;
Mannion et al., 2012). Meat available at retail outlets comes through a
long chain of slaughtering and transportation, where each step may
pose a risk of microbial contamination including salmonellae. The sa-
nitary conditions of abattoir and meat shop environments play im-
portant roles in the spreading of Salmonella contamination (Acha and
Szyfres, 2001; Mannion et al., 2012; Garedew et al., 2015).

Contamination of food with antibiotic-resistant Salmonella can be a
major threat to public health, due partly to increased virulence and
treatment failures (Helms et al., 2002; Angulo et al., 2004; Varma et al.,
2005). The use of antimicrobial agents in food animals may promote
development of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella, with potential
for transmission to humans via the food supply or other routes (Angulo
et al., 2000; Threlfall, 2002).

Even if data regarding meat-borne diseases in Ethiopia are scarce,
several studies conducted in diﬀerent parts of the country have shown
the prevalence of Salmonella in cattle, cattle carcasses and beef (Nyeleti
et al., 2000; Alemayehu et al., 2003; Ejeta et al., 2004; Addis et al.,
2011; Sibhat et al., 2011; Alemu and Zewde, 2012). The prevalence of
non-typhoidal salmonellae in humans has also been described (Aseﬀa
et al., 1994; Mache et al., 1997; Addis et al., 2011; Eguale et al., 2015).
A high level of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella isolated from food
animals has also been reported in Ethiopia (Alemayehu et al., 2003;
Molla et al., 2003; Molla et al., 2004; Aragaw et al., 2007).

Knowledge on the occurrence and identiﬁcation of sources and
points of contamination are imperative for implementation of eﬀective
strategies for prevention of contamination of meat with Salmonella. It is
also important to monitor antimicrobial resistance proﬁle of Salmonella
isolates for proper treatment of patients. Therefore, this study was
conducted with the aim of describing the occurrence and antimicrobial
resistance of Salmonella serotypes in slaughter cattle, slaughterhouse
environment and retail beef in Hawassa, southern Ethiopia.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Study area and animals

The study was undertaken from November 2015 to April 2016 in
Hawassa town and involved the Hawassa Municipality abattoir and 100
butcher shops in the town. Hawassa is the capital city of Southern
Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Regional State (SNNPRS) located
about 275 km South of Addis Ababa. It is geographically positioned at
7°5′ latitude N and 38°29′ longitude E at an altitude of 1708 m a.s.l. The
mean annual rainfall and temperature of the area vary from 800 to
1000 mm and 20.1–25 °C respectively. According to the Central
Statistical Agency (CSA) population census report, Hawassa town had
259,803 residents in 2007 (CSA, 2008). Hawassa is frequently visited
by national and international tourists. The municipality of Hawassa
town has its abattoir that gives service to the town’s community.

On average, 100–150 adult beef cattle are slaughtered per day at
Hawassa Municipality abattoir, except on Wednesdays and Fridays.
After arriving at the slaughterhouse, the animals are inspected, and
those ﬁt to be slaughtered are moved into pens where they spend an
average of 8–10 h without feed before slaughter.

2.2. Sampling and sample collection

The study involved bacteriological examination of samples collected
from 150 apparently healthy slaughtered cattle, 11 slaughterhouse ﬂoor
swabs (SHFS) and 100 beef samples from butcher shops for Salmonella.
The sample size for the slaughter cattle was calculated with an expected
7% estimated prevalence (Alemu and Zewde, 2012), desired 95%
conﬁdence interval and 5% precision (Thrusﬁeld, 2005) which gives a
sample size of 100 animals; the sample size was increased to 150 to
improve precision. The study animals were selected with systematic
random sampling technique from a batch of cattle destined to be
slaughtered on the sample collection day. On each sampling day, which
was held weekly, four types of samples were collected from 10 to 15
selected cattle. The chosen animals were followed along the slaugh-
tering process to collect the appropriate samples. Accordingly, carcass
swabs (CS), mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), spleen and cecal content
(CC) samples, 150 each, were collected aseptically in separate sterile
containers making the total number of samples collected from slaugh-
tered animals 600. Simultaneously, one weekly swab sample was col-
lected for a total of 11 weeks (representing sample collection dates)
from slaughterhouse ﬂoor on the same date of sample collection from
slaughtered animals by rubbing a 1 m*2 m (2 m2) ﬂoor area using a
gauze swab. Additionally, 100 beef samples were collected from 100
randomly selected butcher shops in the town. The butcher shops were
selected from a list of butcher shops registered in the town with a

simple random sampling technique. A total of 711 samples from various
sources were collected during the study, for isolation and character-
ization of Salmonella.

For CS sample, sterile gauze moistened with buﬀered peptone water
(BPW) was rubbed over diﬀerent parts of the carcass (100 cm2 area
each on the rump, ﬂank, brisket and neck) and was then placed into
wide-mouthed, screw-capped, 30 ml, universal glass bottles. Cecal
content samples were collected directly from the cecum into sterile
universal bottles through a puncture made with sterile scalpel blades.
The samples were transported to the Microbiology Laboratory of the
School of Veterinary Medicine of Hawassa University in ice boxes with
ice packs. Upon arrival at the laboratory the samples were stored at 4 °C
in the refrigerator for immediate microbiological analysis within 24 h
of sampling. Samples were identiﬁed by date of collection, sources and
sample type.

2.3. Isolation and identiﬁcation

For the isolation and identiﬁcation of Salmonella, the technique
recommended by the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO-6579) (ISO, 2002) and Quinn et al. (1999) were employed as
previously described (Aragaw et al., 2007) with minor modiﬁcation.
For pre-enrichment, 25 g of MLN, spleen and meat samples each were
weighed, passed over ﬂame to disinfect the surface (MLN and spleen),
cut into small pieces on sterile Petri dish using sterile scalpel blade and
placed in screw capped wide mouth bottles containing 225 ml buﬀered
peptone water (BPW) (HiMedia, Mumbai, India), thoroughly mixed by
shaking and incubated for 16–20 h at 37 °C. Similarly, 25 g of CC was
placed in a wide mouth container containing 225 ml of BPW shaken and
incubated as described above. The swab samples (CS and SHFS) were
also pre-enriched in 225 ml BPW. Rappaport-Vassiliadis (RV) medium
(HiMedia, Mumbai, India) was used for selective enrichment of the
samples. After vortexing the pre-enrichment broth culture 0.1 ml was
transferred to a tube containing 10 ml of RV medium and incubated at
42 °C for 24 h.

Xylose lysine desoxycholate (XLD) agar and Salmonella-Shigella
(SS) agar (both from Oxoid, Hampshire, England) plates were used for
plating out and identiﬁcation. A loop-full of inoculum from RV broth
culture was plated onto XLD and SS plates each and incubated at 37 °C
for 24 h. After incubation, the plates were examined for the presence of
typical and suspect colonies. Up to ﬁve of these colonies were selected
from the selective plating media, streaked onto the surface of nutrient
agar (HiMedia, Mumbai, India) plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h.
Presumptive Salmonella colonies were characterized using biochemical
tests following standard methods (Quinn et al., 1999; ISO, 2002).

Biochemically typical Salmonella isolates were stab-cultured in
tryptone soya agar (Titan Biotech Ltd., Rajasthan, India) and shipped to
the Public Health Agency of Canada, Oﬃce International des Epizooties
(OIE) Reference Laboratory for Salmonellosis, Guelph, Ontario, Canada
for serotyping and phage typing.

2.4. Serotyping and phage typing

For serotyping, the somatic (O) antigens were determined by slide
agglutination tests (Ewing, 1986) and ﬂagellar antigens were de-
termined using a microplate agglutination technique (Shipp and Rowe,
1980). The antigenic formulae of Grimont and Weill (2007) were used
to identify and assign the serotypes of the isolates.

Phage typing of S. enterica serotype 1:4,5,12:i:- isolates was per-
formed by the methods developed by Callow (1959) and extended by
Anderson et al. (1977) with reference phages obtained from the Public
Health England, Gastrointestinal Bacteria Reference Unit, Colindale,
England and the Public Health Agency of Canada, National Laboratory
for Enteric Pathogens, Winnipeg, Canada.

2.5. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

The antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out at Public
Health Agency of Canada, National Microbiology Laboratory at Guelph,
Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance
(CIPARS), Guelph AMR Testing Laboratory, Guelph, Ontario, Canada.
All the 14 isolates, obtained during the study, were tested for a panel of
14 antimicrobials (Panel Type: CMV3AGNF) using the Sensititre®
Automated Microbiology System (Trek Diagnostics, Inc., Weslake, OH,
USA) microtitre plates to determine the minimal inhibitory concentra-
tion (MIC) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Antimicrobial sus-
ceptibility results were interpreted according to Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) (2013, 2014) guideline. The list of a panel of
antimicrobials utilized, their symbols, and concentrations and break-
points are shown in Table 1.

2.6. Data management and analysis

The data collected for each slaughtered animal included sex, age,
breed, body condition, origin and results of the bacteriological ex-
amination of the samples as Salmonella negative or positive. An animal
was considered Salmonella positive when it was positive for at least one
of CC, MLN or spleen samples. Carcass swab sample was used as a
measure of contamination. The data were entered in Microsoft Excel
and were analyzed with Stata statistical software version 13 (Stata
Corp., College Station, TX).

3. Results

3.1. Occurrence of Salmonella

Out of the total of 711 samples examined 14 (2.0%, 95% CI: 1.2,
3.3) were found positive for Salmonella. At an animal
level (if
Salmonella was isolated from at least one of the CC, MLN or spleen
samples) Salmonella was isolated from four (2.7%, 95% CI: 1.0, 7.0) of
the 150 slaughtered cattle examined. Two (1.3%, 95% CI: 0.3, 5.3) of
the 150 carcasses were found contaminated with Salmonella. The oc-
currence at sample level for the slaughtered cattle was 2.7% (95% CI:
1.0, 7.0) for CC and 1.3% (95% CI: 0.3, 5.3) for MLN. Four of the 100
beef samples (4.0%, 95% CI: 1.5, 10.3) collected from butcher shops
and two of the 11 (18.2%, 95% CI: 3.5, 58.0) SHFS samples yielded
Salmonella (Table 2).

3.2. Serotype distribution

A total of 14 isolates belonging to the Salmonella enterica subsp.
enterica group were recovered during the study. These isolates belonged
to 3 serotypes namely Salmonella enterica serotype Muenchen (4 iso-
lates), S. enterica serotype Korovi (5) and S. enterica serotype 1,4,5,12,i:-
(5). All of the S. enterica serotype 1:4,5,12:i:- isolates were found to
belong to phage type 120.

Salmonella enterica serotype Korovi was isolated from CC (n = 3),
CS (1) and SHFS (1), and S. enterica serotype 1:4,5,12:i:- was isolated
from CC (n = 1), MLN (2), CS (1) and SHFS (1). Salmonella enterica
serotype Muenchen, however, was isolated only from beef samples
collected from butcher shops (Table 3).

Only one individual animal was detected having two diﬀerent ser-
otypes in various samples: S. enterica serotype Korovi and S. enterica
serotype 1,4,5,12:i:- in CC and MLN respectively.

3.3. Antimicrobial resistance

All the 14 isolates of Salmonella obtained in the study were tested for
susceptibility to 14 antimicrobials (Table 1) and all of them were found
susceptible to all of the antimicrobials used.

4. Discussion

The occurrence of Salmonella in slaughtered cattle, CS and retail
beef observed in this study was generally low compared to previous
reports from diﬀerent parts of the county (Ashenaﬁ, 1994; Nyeleti et al.,
2000; Alemayehu et al., 2003; Sibhat et al., 2011; Alemu and Zewde,
2012; Garedew et al., 2015). However, we acknowledge that our

carcass sample size was too small to identify any trends and possible
comparison with other studies. The reason for this was that the sample
size formula used was not adjusted for precision down form the default
5% used. Thus, a more proper precision of 7% ± 2% would have given
a sample size of 625.

Salmonella occurrence in slaughtered animals, tissues and carcasses
may be aﬀected by hygienic conditions of holding pens, transportation
stress, length of stay in lairage, hygienic status of the slaughterhouse
environment and even the prevalence of Salmonella in beef cattle po-
pulation supplying the slaughterhouses (Smeltzer et al., 1980; Morgan
et al., 1987; Berends et al., 1997; Mannion et al., 2012).

We isolated three serotypes of Salmonella belonging to the S. enterica
subsp. enterica group. Both Salmonella enterica serotype Korovi and
serotype 1,4,5,12:i:- were isolated from CC, CS and slaughterhouse
ﬂoor, while serotype 1,4,5,12:i:- and serotype Muenchen were isolated
only from MLN and beef, respectively. Earlier works in Ethiopia have
reported the isolation of S. enterica serotype Muenchen from cattle
(Nyeleti et al., 2000), camels (Pegram et al., 1981; Molla et al., 2004)
and pigs (Aragaw et al., 2007). The serotype was among the most fre-
quently isolated serotypes from meat or poultry in the US (FSIS, 2016)
and the ten most commonly identiﬁed serotypes causing human sal-
monellosis in 2012 in the US (CDC, 2014). Salmonella enterica serotype
Muenchen has been associated with several disease outbreaks in people
in diﬀerent parts of the world (Proctor et al., 2001; Buchholz et al.,
2005; OzFoodNet, 2005; CDC, 2016).

Salmonella enterica serotype 1,4,5,12:i:- and serotype Korovi, the
other two serotypes isolated in the present study, are to the best of our
knowledge reported here for the ﬁrst time in Ethiopia, while none of the
common previously reported serotypes in cattle (Alemayehu et al.,
2003; Sibhat et al., 2011; Alemu and Zewde, 2012) were detected.
However, the isolation of S. enterica serotype 1,4,5,12:i:- is in agree-
ment with the rise of the serotype throughout the world. The recently
emerged serotype has become one of the most frequently isolated ser-
otypes in many countries (Echeita et al., 1999, 2001; CDC, 2008; Switt
et al., 2009; Hauser et al., 2010; Mandilara et al., 2013; FSIS, 2016;
Yang et al., 2015). Several molecular studies conducted on this serotype
in diﬀerent parts of the world (Echeita et al., 2001; Zamperini et al.,
2007; Bugarel et al., 2012; Mandilara et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2015)
demonstrated that it is a monophasic variant of S. enterica serotype
Typhimurium unable to express the phase 2 ﬂagellar antigens (lacking
the second phase of H-antigen).

During 2011 Salmonella enterica serotype 1,4,5,12:i:- was the third
frequently isolated serotype in Ireland next only to S. enterica serotype
Typhimurium and S. enterica serotype Enteritidis (NSSLRL, 2011).
During 2011 and 2012, it was the 3rd most frequently reported serotype
from conﬁrmed human cases in the EU/EEA countries (EFSA/ECDC,
2014a). It was also the 5th most commonly isolated serotype among

laboratory-conﬁrmed human salmonellosis infections in the US in 2012
(CDC, 2014). This bacterium has also ranked among the four most
frequent serotypes causing human salmonellosis in China (Yang et al.,
2015). The identiﬁcation of this serotype, which emerged in Europe in
the mid-1990s and growing fast in proportional prevalence, in Ethiopia
indicates that the serotype might have been imported to the country
through contaminated foods or infected animals or human beings. The
antimicrobial proﬁles of our S. enterica serotype 1,4,5,12:i:- isolates,
however, diﬀer from the most commonly encountered multidrug-re-
sistant isolates (clones) reported elsewhere (CDC, 2008; EFSA/ECDC,
2014b; Yang et al., 2015).

Although many studies consider pigs as the reservoir of S. enterica
serotype 1,4,5,12:i:- (De la Torre et al., 2003; Hauser et al., 2010),
outbreaks associated with beef have been reported in Denmark (ECDC,
2012). Beef, along with pork, was reported to be one of the most im-
portant reservoirs of this serotype in China (Yang et al., 2015).

There are only a few published reports of isolation of S. enterica
serotype Korovi from around the world. It was ﬁrst reported from a
serpent from the then Belgian Congo in 1955 (Kauﬀmann and van Oye,
1955). It was also isolated from ‘lizards and snakes’ in Sweden in 1994
for the ﬁrst time in that country (only one isolate) (Boqvist et al., 2003).
Our ﬁndings are the ﬁrst report of the serotype from Ethiopia. The
isolation of this rare serotype, which has been reported mainly from
reptiles, in a relatively high frequency (n = 3) in the CC of slaughter
cattle on diﬀerent sample collection dates and its detection from CS and
slaughterhouse ﬂoor samples needs further study.

Contrary to our ﬁnding of pan-susceptibility in all 14 isolates ob-
tained in our study, S. enterica serotype 1,4, [5],12:i:- was reported to
be characterized by multidrug resistance (; Echeita et al., 1999, 2001;
Mandilara et al., 2013; EFSA/ECDC, 2014b, Yang et al., 2015). Ex-
tremely high levels of resistance were observed for ampicillin, strep-
tomycin, sulfonamides and tetracycline (resistance [R] type-ASSuT) in
EU (EFSA/ECDC, 2014b) and China (Yang et al., 2015). Salmonella
enterica serotype Muenchen has also been found in some studies to
demonstrate multiple drug resistance for up to seven antimicrobials:
ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, tetra-
cycline, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and kanamycin (R-type ACSSuT-
AxK) (Gebreyes and Thakur, 2005). Our ﬁnding was, however, con-
sistent with previous reports in Ethiopia which indicated susceptibility
of the serotype to all antimicrobials tested (Molla et al., 2004; Aragaw,
2005). As the lack of antimicrobial resistance of the isolates observed in
this study was based on a small number of observations (n = 14), there
is a need for a study with larger number of isolates to substantiate it.
The results of this study indicate that the occurrence of Salmonella in
cattle slaughtered at Hawassa and beef sold in butcher shops in the
town are relatively low, with 2.3% slaughter cattle and 4.0% fresh retail
beef positive for culture. The study also demonstrated that serotypes
which are characterized by multiple drug resistance somewhere may be
pan-susceptible elsewhere. This study contributes to the global in-
formation on the occurrence and antibiogram of Salmonella in general
and the expanding S. enterica serotype 1,4,5,12:i:- and the rare and
usually reptile-associated S. enterica serotype Korovi in particular as the
ﬁrst report of their isolation in Ethiopia.

The contamination of carcasses and beef with Salmonella serotypes
known to cause human infections, although at a low level, is a sig-
niﬁcant public health risk in Ethiopia where a considerable proportion
of the population consumes raw or undercooked beef. Eﬀorts to keep
the prevalence low through control in animals, prevention of con-
tamination of animal products at slaughter and butcher shops, and
adequate cooking of meat are recommended.
