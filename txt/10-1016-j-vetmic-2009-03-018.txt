Antimicrobial therapy is a useful tool to control bovine mastitis caused by Staphylococcus
aureus, as consequence an increase in staphylococci resistant cases has been registered.
Alternative strategies are desirable and bacteriocins represent attractive control agents to
prevent bovine mastitis. The aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of ﬁve
bacteriocins synthesized by Bacillus thuringiensis against S. aureus isolates associated to
bovine mastitis. Fifty S. aureus isolates were recovered from milk composite samples of 26
Holstein lactating cows from one herd during September 2007 to February 2008 in Me´ xico
and susceptibility of those isolates to 12 antibiotics and 5 bacteriocins from B. thuringiensis
was evaluated. S. aureus isolates were mainly resistant to penicillin (92%), dicloxacillin
(86%), ampicillin (74%) and erythromycin (74%); whereas susceptibility to gentamicin,
trimethoprim and tetracycline was detected at, respectively, 92%, 88%, and 72%. All S.
aureus isolates showed susceptibility to the ﬁve bacteriocins synthesized by B.
thuringiensis, mainly to morricin 269 and kurstacin 287 followed by kenyacin 404,
entomocin 420 and tolworthcin 524. Our results showed that S. aureus isolates had
differences in the antimicrobial resistance patterns and were susceptible to bacteriocins
produced by B. thuringiensis, which could be useful as an alternative method to control
bovine mastitis.

1. Introduction

Bovine mastitis is a major disease affecting the dairy
industry that results in economic loses and decreases
animal health (Ruegg, 2003). Staphylococcus aureus is the
most predominant contagious pathogen responsible for
clinical and subclinical infections in lactating cows (Kerro-
Dego et al., 2002). Antimicrobial therapy has been a
valuable tool for controlling mastitis and as a consequence

an increase in the frequency of staphylococci resistance
has been recorded (Myllys et al., 1998; Ochoa-Zarzosa
et al., 2008). Thus, alternative methods for controlling the
bovine mastitis are required. One of these alternatives
could be the use of bacteriocins.

Bacteriocins are natural peptides synthesized and
secreted by bacteria, which inhibit the growth of both
closely related (Jack et al., 1995) and nonrelated species
(De la Fuente-Salcido et al., 2008). Several bacteriocins
have been proposed as potential alternatives to mastitis
control. Nisin, from Lactococcus lactis, has activity against
mastitis pathogens and has been formulated into some
commercially available products (Ryan et al., 1998; Wu

180

et al., 2007). Also, bacteriocins produced by S. aureus, S.
epidermidis and Streptococcus gallolyticus have been tested
against strains of both S. aureus and Streptococcus species
isolated from bovine mastitis (Varella Coelho et al., 2007;
Pieterse et al., 2008).

Bacillus thuringiensis is a naturally occurring Gram-
positive spore-forming soil bacterium routinely used
worldwide in insect biocontrol; however, diverse bacter-
iocins from this bacterium have been reported (Kamoun
et al., 2005; Gray et al., 2006). Recently, ﬁve new B.
thuringiensis bacteriocins (morricin 269, kurstacin 287,
kenyacin 404, entomocin 420, and tolworthcin 524) from
Mexican strains were reported (Barboza-Corona et al.,
2007; De la Fuente-Salcido et al., 2008). In spite of their
potential applied use, B. thuringiensis bacteriocins have not
been evaluated against bovine mastitis pathogens. In this
work, we demonstrated that each one of the bacteriocins
tested showed inhibitory action against S. aureus isolates.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. S. aureus isolates

A total of 26 Holstein cows kept in one herd were
analyzed through September 2007 to February 2008 in
Morelia, Michoaca´ n, Me´ xico. Subclinical mastitis was
determined by California mastitis test and 50 S. aureus
isolates were collected. S. aureus isolates were obtained
from raw milk composite aliquots (200 ml) distributed on
Blood agar plates (37 8C, 24 h; Bioxon, Me´ xico). S. aureus
isolates were identiﬁed by standard biochemical tests and
corroborate by amplifying the gene nuc encoding staphy-
lococcal thermostable nuclease (Brakstad et al., 1992).
Isolates were identiﬁed by the letters STA (S. aureus)
followed by an arabic number.

2.2. Antimicrobial susceptibility of S. aureus isolates

S. aureus

isolates were evaluated for antibiotic
susceptibility with the disk diffusion method on Muel-
ler-Hinton (MH) agar plates (Bioxon, Me´ xico). The
following Gram-positive multi discs (Bio-Rad, Me´ xico)
were used: ampicillin, 10 mg (28); cephalotin, 30 mg
(14); cefotaxime, 30 mg (14); ceftazidime, 30 mg
(14); cefuroxime, 30 mg (14); dicloxacillin, 1 mg
(10); erythromycin, 15 mg (13); gentamicin, 10 mg
(12); peﬂoxacin, 5 mg (14); penicillin, 10 U (28);

tetracycline, 30 mg (14) and trimethoprim, 25 mg (10).
In parenthesis are indicated the diameters (mm) of
inhibition zones used to consider an isolate as resistant,
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A MH
agar plate without antimicrobials was used as negative
control for each isolate. Plates were incubated at 37 8C for
24 h.

2.3. B. thuringiensis strains and production of partially
puriﬁed bacteriocins

The ﬁve B. thuringiensis strains used as bacteriocin
producers are listed in Table 1. B. cereus 183 (Interna-
tional Entomopathogenic Bacillus Centre, Institut Pas-
teur, Paris, France) was employed as an indicator
bacterium to determine the activity of bacteriocins
before testing against S. aureus isolates. To produce
bacteriocin, bacterial strains were cultured overnight in
TSB (Tryptic soy broth, Bioxon, Me´ xico) at 28 8C with
180 rpm. An aliquot of 5 ml (1  109 cells/ml) was
mixed with 45 ml of fresh TSB and incubated overnight
during the time of the highest bacteriocin synthesis as
previously determined (Barboza-Corona et al., 2007).
Cultures were centrifuged and supernatant was ﬁltered
through a 0.2-mm ﬁlter. Cell-free supernatants were
concentrated with ammonium sulfate to 80% saturation
at 4 8C and precipitated proteins were pelleted by
centrifugation at 16,000  g for 30 min at 4 8C, resus-
pended in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and
dialyzed overnight against the same buffer using a
mini-dialysis kit with a 1 kDa cut-off
(Amersham
Biosciences). Activity of each strain was corroborated
with both the ﬂuorogenic (De la Fuente-Salcido et al.,
2007) and the well-diffusion methods using B. cereus 183
as indicator bacterium (Barboza-Corona et al., 2007).

2.4. Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocins from
B. thuringiensis against isolates of S. aureus

The modiﬁed well-diffusion method was used to assess
antibacterial activity of partially puriﬁed bacteriocins
against S. aureus isolates. Bacteria were cultivated over-
night at 37 8C in Luria broth (LB, Difco), and 100 ml
(1  109 cell/ml) of each isolate were mixed with 15 ml of
TSB with warm soft agar 0.7% (w/v) and plated. Wells,
8 mm in diameter, were dug into the agar and kept for 2 h
at 37 8C. Then, 100 ml of partially puriﬁed bacteriocin

preparations obtained as described above was added to
each well and incubated for 12 h at 4 8C to allow diffusion
of samples, followed by an additional incubation at 28 8C or
37 8C for 1 day before diameters of inhibition zones were
measured (Table 2). The minimum detectable zone
measured for analytic purposes was 1 mm2 beyond the
well diameter. Assays were repeated in triplicate and the
average result was recorded. For our purposes, we deﬁned
one unit (U) of bacteriocin activity as equal to 1 mm2 of
growth inhibition zone of the indicator bacterium (Del-
gado et al., 2005; Barboza-Corona et al., 2007).

3. Results

3.1. Collect of S. aureus isolates

In a regional program for the study of mastitis, 26
Holstein cows maintained in one herd were analyzed
through September 2007 to February 2008 in Morelia,
Michoaca´ n, Me´ xico. Incidence of subclinical mastitis in the
herd during this period was 51%. Fifty S. aureus isolates
were obtained from these cows and identiﬁed according to
biochemical properties and PCR ampliﬁcation of the gene

Owens et al., 1997; Kerro-Dego et al., 2002). Subclinical
mastitis prevalence during this study was 51%, which was
greater than a previous data shown in the same region
(29%) (Ochoa-Zarzosa et al., 2008). These differences could
be explained as the preceding study was carried out in
different herds with heterogeneity in the cattle.

Antimicrobial susceptibility evaluation for mastitis
pathogens is a valuable tool in mastitis control and should
be performed in different dairy regions, since resistance
patterns and diversity of isolates vary on a per-region
basis. In this study, we detected that S. aureus isolates have
a high level of resistance to penicillin class antibiotics and
erythromycin (>74%) (Fig. 1). In the herd used for this
study, penicillin class antibiotics have been frequently
used for the control of mastitis; this could explain the high
level of resistance to penicillin detected. Nevertheless, all
isolates showed high sensitivity levels to gentamicin, and
in less proportion to trimethoprim and tetracycline. These
results are in agreement with previous studies performed
in others herds of the region (Lo´ pez-Meza et al., 2006;
Ochoa-Zarzosa et al., 2008).

Alternatively, bacteriocins from several origins have
shown antibacterial activities against staphylococci, and
are promising candidates for the treatment of S. aureus
(Ryan et al., 1998; Capparelli et al., 2007). Recently, it has
been demonstrated that only concentrated bacteriocins
from B. thuringiensis obtained by induction assays showed
inhibitory activity against a strain of S. aureus (ATCC
25923) (De la Fuente-Salcido et al., 2008). In the present
study we have demonstrated that the ﬁve bacteriocins
from B. thuringiensis produced by assays without induction
(i.e. low bacteriocin concentration) had inhibitory activity
to all S. aureus isolates tested by the well-diffusion assay
(Table 2). This interesting observation suggests that all S.
aureus isolates from cows with mastitis from Morelia,
Michoaca´ n, Me´ xico showed susceptibility to the ﬁve
bacteriocins of B. thuringiensis, conﬁrming the potential
applied use of those bacteriocins as an alternative to
control mastitis where the etiological agent is S. aureus. It is
important to note that further experiments including
puriﬁed and normalized samples are required to do
comparison assays between the ﬁve bacteriocins
employed in this work. Although all S. aureus isolates
were inhibited by the ﬁve bacteriocins tested, we did not
detect any correlation between sensitivity to antibiotics
and bacteriocins, probably because they might have
different mechanisms of action (Chen and Hoover,
2003). Although differences in the inhibitory action against
a large number of S. aureus
isolates were found,
bacteriocins could be gathered in two groups according
to their activities. In the ﬁrst and second groups we can
include, respectively, morricin 269, kurstacin 287 and
kenyacin 404, entomocin 420, tolworthcin 524. Bacter-
iocins from the ﬁrst group showed the highest activity
toward the S. aureus isolates followed by those of the
second group. Interestingly this classiﬁcation is similar to a
previously reported work (Barboza-Corona et al., 2007)
where bacteriocins were categorized in two groups based
on distinctive biophysical, biochemical and antimicrobial
properties, which suggest that bacteriocins from the same
group could indeed, represent similar or bacteriocins with

nuc. Otherwise, the environmental pathogens responsible
of mastitis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, were
also isolated but were not included in this study.

3.2. Antimicrobial susceptibility of S. aureus isolates

In general, the S. aureus isolates showed a variable
susceptibility behavior towards the 12 antimicrobials
tested. All S. aureus isolates were resistant to two or more
antimicrobials, except STA 71, STA 89, STA 90 and STA 91
isolates. The 50 S. aureus isolates were mainly resistant to
penicillin (92%), dicloxacillin (86%), ampicillin (74%) and
erythromycin (74%). In the other hand, some isolates were
resistant to gentamicin (8%), trimethoprim (12%) and
tetracycline (28%) (Fig. 1). Isolates STA 51 and STA 59
showed resistance to all antibiotic tested, whereas isolates
STA 71, STA 90 and STA 91 were susceptible to all
antibiotics.

3.3. Inhibitory activity of bacteriocins from B. thuringiensis
against S. aureus isolates

The sensitivity of 50 S. aureus isolates to ﬁve different
bacteriocins from B. thuringiensis (Table 1) was evaluated
by assays performed by well-diffusion method. All S.
aureus isolates showed susceptibility to the bacteriocins
synthesized from B. thuringiensis (Table 2). Morricin 269
and kurstacin 287 showed the highest activities followed
by kenyacin 404, entomocin 420 and tolworthcin 524. S.
aureus isolates STA 70, STA 72, STA 76, STA 81, STA 86 and
STA 90 showed greater inhibition zones to bacteriocins
tested. Alternatively, S. aureus isolates STA 79, STA 83, STA
84 and STA 88 showed the lowest sensitivity to bacter-
iocins (Table 2). No correlation among sensitivity to
antibiotics and bacteriocins was detected.

4. Discussion

In this study, we assessed the antimicrobial activities of
bacteriocins from B. thuringiensis against S. aureus isolates
from cases of bovine mastitis. S. aureus is one of the most
frequently isolated pathogen causing clinical or subclinical
mastitis. This bacterium is difﬁcult to treat with anti-
microbial therapy owing to an increase in the resistance
frequency to antimicrobial agents (Sandholm et al., 1990;

J.E. Barboza-Corona et al. / Veterinary Microbiology 138 (2009) 179–183

high identity. Our results are in agreement with others
studies that showed that bacteriocins from different
bacteria (L. lactis, S. aureus, S. epidermidis and gallolyticus)
have antibacterial activity against mastitis pathogens
(Ryan et al., 1998; Varella Coelho et al., 2007; Wu et al.,
2007; Pieterse et al., 2008).

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that S. aureus
isolates from this work showed two important character-
istics: differences in the resistance patterns to antibiotics
and susceptibility to bacteriocins from B. thuringiensis.
These antimicrobial peptides could be useful as an
alternative method to control bovine mastitis. Currently,
we are conducting experiments to hyperexpress bacter-
iocins from B. thuringiensis to use puriﬁed and concen-
trated bacteriocins for safety and applied use in mastitis
control.
