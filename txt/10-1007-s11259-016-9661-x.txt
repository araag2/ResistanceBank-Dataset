Abstract Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most important
pathogens of both humans and animal. Methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important human patho-
gen that causes serious infections both in hospitals and commu-
nities due to its multidrug resistance tendency. This study was
undertaken to characterize the MRSA isolates from pigs and to
determine the antimicrobial resistance of these isolates. Forty
nine MRSA strains (one strain per positive pig) isolated from
pigs of Northeast India were characterized by SCCmec typing
and antimicrobial resistance. The overall prevalence of MRSA
was 7.02 % with the highest prevalence recorded in pigs aged
1–3 months (P = 0.001) and in nasal samples (P = 0.005). Two
SCC mec types (type III and V) were found in Indian pigs with
predominance of type V. All isolates were resistant to penicillin.
Seventeen resistance groups were observed where 87.75 % iso-
lates showed multidrug resistance (showed resistance to three
or more classes of antimicrobials). The most predominant re-
sistance pattern observed was Oxytetracycline + Penicillin +
Sulfadiazine + Tetracycline accounting 12.24 % of the isolates.
The present study contributes to the understanding of charac-
teristics and antimicrobial resistance of porcine MRSA isolates
which in turn will help in devising strategy for the control of
this pathogen. Findings of the study also throw light on multi-
drug resistance MRSA and emphasize the need for judicious
use of antimicrobials in animal practice.

Introduction

Staphylococcus aureus is a common bacterium found on the
skin and nasal passages of healthy people. It is commonly
associated with skin and soft tissue infections and sometimes
it causes pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, sepsis and peri-
carditis. S. aureus bacteria harboring the mecA gene are resis-
tant to methicillin and other β-lactam antimicrobials and are
referred to as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). MRSA
has become a pathogen of increasing importance in hospitals
(healthcare-associated MRSA), the community (community-
associated MRSA) and livestock operations (livestock-
associated MRSA) (Graveland et al. 2011b). To date,
livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) has been found
worldwide, particularly among people who are involved with
livestock farming (Frana et al. 2013). These bacteria can be
transmitted to humans in close contact with MRSA-colonized
animals (Smith and Pearson 2011). Livestock, especially pigs
can serve as reservoirs for LA-MRSA (Lewis et al. 2008).
Studies on the prevalence and characterization of MRSA
from pigs have been carried out by several authors from
different parts of the world. Dierikx et al. (2016) reported that
39 % of pigs and 81 % of the slaughter batches at Dutch
slaughterhouses were MRSA positive. Verhegghe et al.
(2016) studied the prevalence of livestock-associated methi-
cillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) in
Belgian pork and also characterized the MRSA isolates by
SCCmec typing, multiple-locus variable number tandem re-
peat analysis and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, a selec-
tion of isolates were subjected to pulsed-field gel electropho-
resis and spa typing. Narvaez-Bravo et al. (2016) investigated
the prevalence of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA), their spa-types and antimicrobial resistance profiles
at various steps during commercial pork production from three
plants and they found a higher prevalence of MRSA in the

nasal cavity of incoming pigs at all three plants, but a notable
reduction in MRSA along the pork processing steps. Sun et al.
(2015) studied the prevalence as well as characterized
Staphylococcus aureus from growing pigs in the USA and
observed a relatively low herd prevalence of MRSA in the
US swine industry, but confirmed that methicillin susceptible
variants of the most common MRSA genotypes found in
swine globally are endemic in the US.

A thorough understanding of the molecular epidemiology
and evolution of MRSA is required for detection, tracking,
control as well as prevention of human diseases caused by this
organism. Full characterization of MRSA requires definition
of not only the putative bacterial genetic background but also
of the complex and heterologous SCCmec elements.
Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing
is essential for understanding the molecular epidemiology of
MRSA. To date, at least 11 types (I-XI) of SCCmec elements
have been identified (Ito et al. 2014). The new MRSA nomen-
clature scheme set by the International Union of Microbiology
Societies incorporates SCCmec typing information in con-
junction with that provided by multilocus sequence typing
(Robinson and Enright 2004).

The widespread use of antibiotics has led to the emer-
gence of multidrug-resistant strains, making their eradication
more difficult. Practices like preventive therapy (mainly of
digestive and respiratory disorders), deviations from ap-
proved posology (prolonged treatment duration or under-
dosing) are common in animal production facilities
(Timmerman et al. 2006). The use of antimicrobial drugs
in food-producing animals is considered to contribute to
the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (Gyssens 2001).
Although contact with animals seems to be the most impor-
tant risk factor for human, meat products may also be a
source of the bacteria (Van Duijkeren et al. 2007).

Although MRSA is endemic in India and its incidence
varies from 25 % in western part of India to 50 % in South
India (Gopalakrishnan and Sureshkumar 2010; Patel et al.
2010), these studies are confined only to isolates from
humans and available literature revealed that no reports are
available either on prevalence or characterization of MRSA
isolates from animals (including pigs) in India. The present
study was undertaken to characterize the MRSA isolates
from pigs as well as to determine the antimicrobial resis-
tance of the isolates.

Materials and methods

Sample collection, isolation and identification of MRSA

Six hundred and ninety eight (698) pigs in the age group of 2–
18 weeks belonging to the North Eastern States of India were
used for the study. The total number of pig farms included in

Vet Res Commun

the study was six (6) representing the major pig producing
states of Northeast India. The distance between the farm
ranged from 120 Km to 600Km. The average number of pigs
per studied farm was 267. Nasal (n = 258), skin (n = 230) and
rectal (n = 210) swab samples were collected from these pigs
during the period of 2012–15. Nasal swabs were taken from
both anterior nares using dry cotton swabs, skin swab samples
were taken by swabbing three to four times the skin surface
behind one ear using cotton swabs humidified by PBS and
rectal swabs were collected directly from the rectum. All swab
samples were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in pre-enrichment
media containing tryptic soy broth (Himedia, Mumbai, India)
with 10 mL of 10 % NaCl. Then the samples were streaked
onto mannitol salt agar (Himedia, Mumbai, India) with 6 mg/
L of oxacillin (Himedia, Mumbai, India) and incubated at
37 °C for 24 h. The colonies suspected to be S. aureus derived
from each sample (one strain per positive sample) were select-
ed and identified by Gram staining with Gram-positive cocci
and catalase activity. The colonies were re-streaked onto tryp-
tic soy agar plates (Himedia, Mumbai, India) and incubated at
37 °C for 24 h. A coagulase test was carried out, and the
presumptive positive samples were further screened for meth-
icillin resistance by disc diffusion with 1 μg oxacillin (diam-
eter of the inhibition zone for MRSA must be less than
10 mm.) (CLSI 2009). Several authors have reported detection
of MRSA by cefoxitin (30 μg) disc diffusion method in ac-
cordance with the recommendations of Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (Fayyaz et al. 2013; Uzun
et al. 2013; Çıkman et al. 2015). When mecA gene analysis
was considered as the reference method and several methods
were compared for detection of MRSA, the highest specificity
and positive predictive values were obtained by the cefoxitin
discdiffusion (CDD) method (Uzun et al. 2013). Similarly
Mallick and Basak (2011) opined that CDD method could
be a good choice for detecting methicillin resistance in S
aureus strains in day to day practice where mecA PCR cannot
be performed. Identification of MRSA isolates was further
confirmed by multiplex PCR which simultaneously detects
16S rRNA, mecA and nuc genes (Louie et al. 2002). All
MRSA isolates were kept in brain-heart infusion broth
(Himedia, Mumbai, India) with 15 % glycerol at −80 °C for
SCCmec typing.

Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec)
typing

Isolated bacteria were subcultured twice onto 5 % sheep blood
Columbia agar plates (Himedia, Mumbai, India) prior to DNA
extraction. Genomic DNA was extracted by using DNeasy
Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, CA, USA). In order to classify
the SCCmec type and subtype, monoplex PCR assays using
the sequence of primers and conditions described by Zhang
et al. (2005) was used.

Antimicrobial susceptibility

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the disk
diffusion method according to the Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute guidelines (CLSI 2009). The isolates were
interpreted as sensitive, intermediately sensitive and resistant
according to the inhibition zone diameter using CLSI
recommendations.

Data analysis

Analyses were performed with SPSS 13.0 software for
Windows with a probability (P) value <0.05 as statistically
significant. The main purpose of the statistical analysis was
to find out the influence (if any and if present statistically
significant or not) of age and location (anatomical location)
on the prevalence of MRSA in pigs. Analysis was also carried
out to find out the statistical difference (if any) in the temporal
distribution of MRSA isolates in the studied area.

Results

Methicillin resistant gene (mecA) could be detected in 49 pigs
(out of 698 pigs examined) giving the overall prevalence of
MRSA as 7.02 % in the present study. Positive animals were
present in all the herds included in the study and the prevalence
in the studied farms ranged from 4.70 % to 8.16 %. Highest
prevalence was observed in nasal (10.85 %) and skin (6.08 %)
samples and lowest in faecal (3.33 %) samples (P = 0.005,
Table 1). The prevalence of MRSA was found to be highest
(11.28 %) in pigs aged 1–3 months whereas prevalence was
lowest (2.33 %) in pigs above 3 months of age (P = 0.001,
Table 1). Studies on temporal distribution of positive samples
revealed non-significant difference in prevalence (Table 1).
SCC mec typing of MRSA isolates revealed the presence of
types III and Vof which 40.81 % (20) isolates belonged to type
III and 59.18 % (29) belonged to type V. High frequency of
resistance was observed for antimicrobials such as penicillin
(100 %), oxytetracycline (83.67 %) and tetracycline (81.63 %).
Antimicrobial resistance patterns of the MRSA isolates are
shown in Table 2. Seventeen resistance groups (R1 to R17)
were observed in the present study where 87.75 % isolates
showed resistance to three or more classes of antimicrobials.
The most predominant resistance pattern observed was O +
P + SZ + TE which accounted for 12.24 % of the isolates.

Discussion

Considerable works have been carried out to determine the
prevalence of MRSA in the pig population and its association
with human infection because of the potential public health

risk associated with this organism (Voss 2005). The study
reports the prevalence of MRSA in pig population of North
east India and we could detect methicillin resistant gene
(mecA) in 7.02 % pigs in the present study. The prevalence
recorded in the study was found to be much lower than those
reported by countries such as 22.7 % in Korea (Lim et al.
2012), 26 % in Canada (Khanna et al. 2008), 36 % in the
USA (Smith et al. 2009), 39 % in the Netherlands (de
Neeling et al. 2007) and 49 % in Germany (Tenhagen et al.
2009). The difference in prevalence rate as observed in the
present study could be due to several factors such as geo-
graphical location of the study area, sampling methods, labo-
ratory testing methods and age of the pigs tested (Broens et al.
2011). We have recorded highest prevalence of MRSA in
nasal samples in comparison to samples collected from other
locations of the body which is consistent with the findings of
Dewaele et al. (2011) who reported that MRSA was predom-
inantly detected in the nares, followed by the perineum and
skin and to a lesser degree in the rectum. The distribution of
MRSA along the production chain was studied in a slaughter-
house with a connected processing unit producing fresh pork
(Beneke et al. 2011) and results indicated that MRSA were
frequently found in the noses of pigs (65 %), but less frequent-
ly on carcasses (16 %). Although the present study was not
designed to assess the influence of factors on the prevalence of
MRSA in pigs, a strong association was observed between
presence of young pigs (1–3 months of age) and prevalence
of MRSA which also corroborated with the findings of several
authors (Smith et al. 2009; Weese et al. 2011) who reported
highest prevalence of MRSA in piglets between 6 and
12 weeks of age. Molecular characterization using PCR assay
revealed the presence of only two SCCmec types of which
40.81 % of the MRSA isolates belonged to SCCmec III and
59.18 % belonged to SCCmec V. The present study is consis-
tent with the findings of Tulinski et al. (2012) who observed
that majority (86.67 %) of MRSA isolates from pigs belonged
to SCCmec type V whereas only 13.33 % isolates belonged to
SCCmec type IVa. Similarly Park et al. (2013) found that of
the 30 MRSA isolates identified from nasal samples of the
pigs, 29 isolates were SCCmec type V. On the contrary,
Tenhagen et al. (2009) observed that most of the MRSA iso-
lates from pigs belonged to SCCmec type III which might be
due to geographic variations of MRSA strains as reported by
Stefani, and Varaldo, (2003).

Similar SCC mec types have also been reported from hu-
man from Northeast India as well as from other parts of India
apart from reporting other (other than types III and V) SCC
mec types of MRSA (D’Souza et al. 2010; Bhutia et al. 2015).
SCC mec typing of MRSA isolates from human belonging to
the state of Sikkim, Northeast India revealed the presence of
types I (1.88 %), II (1.88 %), III (3.77 %), IVa (1.88 %) and V
(11.32 %) (Bhutia et al. 2015). Similarly molecular character-
ization of MRSA from patients from Mumbai, India revealed

the presence of SCC mec types III (25 %), IV (34 %) and V
(41 %) (D’Souza et al. 2010). Genotyping of MRSA from
tertiary care hospitals in Coimbatore, South India showed
the presence of SCC mec types III and IVa of which type III
was found to be predominant with a frequency of 94.8 %
(Neetu and Murugan 2016). However, analysis of MRSA
strains isolated from healthy human and patients from
Bengaluru, Mumbai and Pune, India revealed the presence
of only SCC mec type IV (Nadig et al. 2010).

MRSA is a human bacterial pathogen that has emerged as
a major threat in hospitals (as a nosocomial infection) and
the cause of community-acquired infection among high-risk

groups such as veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers and
those in close contact with animals especially with pigs.
The use of antibiotics in livestock production has promoted
the development of multi-drug resistance. In the present
study, all MRSA isolates were resistant to penicillin which
is consistent with the findings of Oppliger et al. (2012) who
observed that all MRSA isolates from pigs were resistant to
penicillin. Similarly in a study conducted in China revealed
that most (90 %) of the isolates from pigs were resistant to
penicillin (Zhang et al. 2012). Resistance against penicillin
is particularly noteworthy because this antimicrobial is com-
monly used for treatment of animal diseases in India.

Vet Res Commun

Acquired resistance to β-lactams is mediated through two
main mechanisms, β-lactamase production or altered peni-
cillin binding protein (PBP2a) production. Bacterial β-
lactamases hydrolyze the β-lactam ring and in staphylococci
typically confer resistance to penicillins. Inhibitors of β-
lactamase can inhibit this resistance mechanism and β-lac-
tam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations are widely used in
some species, but not in swine production (Paterson and
Bonomo 2005). In contrast, altered PBP2a production
encoded by mecA, results in low affinity for all β-lactams
and confers broad resistance to β-lactams that is not affected
by β-lactamase inhibitors. Frana et al. (2013) found that
resistance to tetracycline derivatives (chlortetracycline, oxy-
tetracycline) overall was quite high (87 %). Similarly several
authors opined that tetracycline resistance is a common fea-
ture of most of the MRSA isolates (Smith and Pearson 2011;
Graveland et al. 2011a). A Belgian study which tested 643
pig MRSA ST398 isolates reported almost similar resistant
rates for tetracycline (Crombe et al. 2012).

In the present study, 43 (78.75 %) isolates showed mul-
tidrug resistance where seventeen resistance groups (R1 to
R17) were observed. Studies conducted on characterization
of MRSA isolates from pigs in Hong Kong revealed that
most of the MRSA isolates were multidrug resistant (Ho
et al. 2012). The most predominant resistance pattern ob-
served in the present study was resistance to β-lactams +
tetracyclines + sulphonamides which is consistent with the
findings of Kadlec et al. (2009). Van Duijkeren et al. (2008)
reported that the pressure of the antimicrobial selection is
one of the probable factors that have facilitated the emer-
gence and dispersion of the veterinary MRSA, the most
commonly used being tetracycline and trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole and to which these microorganisms are
more resistant. Similarly Ndi and Barton (2012) opined that
antibiotics used in animals for therapeutics, food production
and diseases prevention promote antibiotic resistance and
this may be the reason for multidrug resistance as observed
in most of the isolates in this study. Although multidrug
resistance is presently defined as resistance to three or more
classes of antibiotics (Magiorakos et al. 2012), it should be
noted that any lack of therapeutic effectiveness due to resis-
tance to the administered substance can be devastating.
Another important aspect is that colonization of livestock
with drug resistant bacteria is often considered a risk factor
for meat contamination by these resistant bacteria (Tenhagen
et al. 2009).

This is perhaps the first report on SCC mec types and an-
timicrobial resistance pattern of MRSA isolates from pigs in
India. The study revealed that most of the MRSA strains iso-
lated in the study are resistant to penicillins and tetracyclines,
the widely used antimicrobials in animal practice. The study
will also form the basis for devising future strategy for the
control of this emerging pathogen.
