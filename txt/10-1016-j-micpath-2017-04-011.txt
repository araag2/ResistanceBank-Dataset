 Bacteriological study of mastitis along with common blood protozoan diseases were studied in 

dromedary  camels  in  Cholistan,  Dera  Ismail  Khan  and  Rahim  Yar  Khan  districts  in  South 

Punjab,  Pakistan.For  this  purpose    300  camels  were  sampled  randomly    at  different  common  

grazing  and  watering  point.  For  study  of  blood  parasites      clinically  suspected  and  apparently 

healthy camels,150 each,  were sampled .An  overall prevalence of 15%and 5%   was recorded 

for  trypanosomiasis  and    Anaplasmosis  respectively..  Trypanosoma  evansi  was  identified  with 

280 bp product on polymerase chain reaction test. There was significant (P< 0.05) decline in the 

values  of  total  erythrocyte  counts,  hemoglobin  concentration,  packed  cell  volume,  serum  total 

proteins and albumin while erythrocyte sedimentation rate was increased in infected camels as 

compared  to  healthy  ones.  Aspartate  aminotransferase,  alanine  aminotransferase,  gamma 

glutamyltransferase  and  alkaline  phosphatase  were  also  significantly  increased  in  blood 

protozoan  the  infected  animals.  Milk  samples  for  bacteriology  were  collected  from  healthy 

lactating camels (n= 100).     Information about different risk factors were gathered on designed 

performa .Subclinical mastitis on surf field test was recorded in 42% camels while 2% cases of 

clinical mastitis were recorded. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus 

dysgalactiae,  Bacillus  cereus  and  .Corynebacterium  kutscheri  were  isolated  with  characteristic 

beta and alpha hemolysis patterns.  Chi-square analysis showed significant difference as p<0.05 

among  various  species  of  bacteria  (χ2=21.649,  P-Value=  0.0001,  df=3).    Antibiogram  showed 

Gentamicin, Norfloxacin, Oxytetracycline as most effective therapy for mastitis in camel.

1.  INTRODUCTION  

The  Pakistani  camel  is  well  known  for  higher  milk  production.  The  Mareecha  breed  is 

considered as the best milk producing camel of the world, with an average milk yield of 4179L 

per year (1). Average lactation length is 270 to 540 days and the total milk production is 1300 to 

4200L/ lactation. Camel milk contains high amounts of proteins, fat,  minerals and C vitamins. 

The high vitamin C content is important in desert areas where green food is not easily available. 

Camel milk has higher  phosphorus content than any other domestic animal. The fat content in 

camel milk is equal to cow milk. So, it is clear that camel milk is superior to the milk of other 

domestic  animals  (2).  In  desert  areas  of  Punjab,  Pakistan,  camel  is  mainly  kept  for  milk 

production  even when milk from cattle is not available (3).   Little research has been done on 

camel  disease  especially  mastitis  as  compared  to  other  ruminants  in  Pakistan.    Mastitis  in  the 

camels has been reported and its prevalence has increased during the past decade (4). (5).  Other 

frequent  bacterial  diseases  of  camel  reported  by  field  vetenarians  in  Punjab,  Pakistan  are 

Hemorrhagic  septicemia,  Black  quarter,  Tetanus,  Brucellosis  and  Anthrax  (5).  Among  vector-

borne  protozoan  diseases,  Trypanosomiasis  or  Surra,  babesiosis,  anaplasmosis  and 

trypanosomiasis  are  principally  important  (6)  and  characterized  by  elevated  body  temperature, 

anemia, emaciation, lymphadenopathy, edema and sudden death (7).  In Pakistan trypanosomiasis 

and mastitis are prevalent as a major threat to the camels causing heavy financial losses.  After 

an outbreak of trypanosomiasis during 1985–1986 in camels of Baluchistan, various studies have 

been  directed  on  camel  trypanosomiasis  in  numerous  areas  of  Pakistan  (8).  Hematology  is  an 

attractively important biomarker in veterinary medicine, worldwide. This biomarker gives us an 

opportunity to explore the physiological and pathological states of the organism. Blood protozoa 

mentioned  above  have  hemato-pathological  effects  in  host  animals  (9).  The  intensity,  duration 

and cure from animal to animal for mastitis and blood protozoan differ depending upon the risk

factors.  (10). Mastitis occurs after invasion of bacteria in teat canal and mammary glands. The 

reported  causative  agents  of  mastitis  are  Streptococci,  Staphylococci,  Escherichia  coli, 

Corynebacterium, Pseudomonas spp, and mycobacterium tuberculosis (11). There is paucity of 

information about the etiological agents associated with camel mastitis. Few available literatures 

indicate  that  Staphylococcus  aureus,  Streptococcus  spp.  (12),  Micrococcus  spp.  Streptococcus 

agalactiae,  coagulase  negative  staphylococci,  Staphylococcus  epidermides,  Pasteurella 

haemolytica, Escherichia coli and Corynebacterium spp. (13) have been implicated as causes of 

mastitis in camels. Sub-clinical mastitis causes the greatest overall losses in most dairy herds and 

is 3-40 times more prevalent than the clinical mastitis. In sub clinical mastitis there is a reduction 

in milk yield, with no obvious clinical signs although milk quality is affected (14).  Depending 

upon severity of mastitis, milk quality is altered not only in nutrient contents but also in increase 

of somatic cell count, leakage of intracellular contents into the milk, alteration in ionic balance 

and decrease in milk production.  The shelf life of mastitis milk is also reduced. Such milk if used 

for yogurt and cheese production would result in low quality final products (15).Treatment with 

a  variety  of  antibiotics  and  anti-inflammatory  drugs  can  be  valuable  when  there  is  clinical 

mastitis.  Animal  factors  (e.g.,  parity,  stage  of  lactation,  somatic  cell  count  history)  and  the 

virulence  of  pathogens  involved  affects  the  protocol  of  treatment,  hence,  animal-specific 

treatment of clinical mastitis is often indicated (16). Keeping in view the economic importance 

of  camel  and  the  losses  caused  by  mastitis  and  blood  protozoan  infections  this  study  was 

designed to find causative pathogens for blood protozoan and mastitis infection  in one humped 

camel (Camelus  dromedarius)   and to suggest the appropriate antibiotic therapy in Cholistan, 

Rahim-Yar-Khan and Dera Ismail Khan districts of South Punjab, Pakistan so that further steps 

in control and prevention of these economically important diseases may be devised.

2.1.Source of Samples (Inclusive and Exclusive Criteria) 

Samples were collected from all three geographical areas of southern Punjab mentioned above. 

Camels kept on free range grazing and open housing without holding sheds were included in the 

study.   For study on mastitis in camels the lactating camels were included in this study Camels 

showing signs of fever, anorexia, dullness, depression, pale mucous membranes, anemia, weight 

loss, facial paralysis, thin hump and dropped to one side and females with history of abortions 

were suspected for being infected with blood parasites (17).The age of individual animals was 

documented on the basis of information provided from the owners. The animals were distributed 

in  four  age  groups.  The  data  regarding  animals’  clinical  history  and  treatment  protocols  were 

also entered in data capture form. 

2.2.Collection of samples: 

100 lactating camels were examined for clinical and subclinical mastitis,thirty three each 

100 

from  Dera  Ghazi  khan  and  Rahim  Yar  Khan  while  34  from  Cholistan.  Clinical  mastitis  was 

101 

diagnosed on the basis of presence of physiological biomarkers of  changes in udder (signs of 

102 

inflammation, differences in texture, disproportionate quarters) and changes in milk (taste, color, 

103 

consistency,  presence  of  flakes)  while  the  subclinical  mastitis  was  diagnosed  by  Surf  Field 

104 

Mastitis Test  Milk samples (10 ml each) were collected in sterilized, screw capped  test tubes  

105 

and    transported to Microbiology Laboratory at University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, 

106 

Lahore  .  .  300  camels,  100  each  from  different  common  grazing  and  watering  point  of  three 

107 

project  sites  mentioned  above  were  selected.  Out  of  300  samples,  150  blood  samples  were 

108 

collected from clinically suspected animals as per physiologic biomarkers mentioned before for 

109 

blood protozoa while 150 samples were collected from apparently healthy  animals to compare 

110 

normal blood parameters. Approximately 5 ml blood sample was collected aseptically by Jugular 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT111 

vein  puncture  from  each  camel  and  transferred  into  anti-coagulants  vacationers  containing 

112 

EDTA  as  an  anticoagulant  for  hematological  examination  and  PCR  (Trypanosoma  evansi 

113 

confirmation) 

114 

2.3.Blood Smear Examination for blood parasites: 

115 

Preparation of blood smear slides was done from the drops of blood collected from jugular vein 

116 

for  parasitological  examination.  Blood  parasites  were  identified  by  their  morphological 

117 

characteristics (17). Changes in blood cells morphology were also documented. 

118 

2.4.Hematological examination and serum biochemistry  

119 

Blood sample for hematological studies were processed at Clinical Medicine Laboratory, UVAS 

120 

Lahore.  Hemoglobin  (Hb)  estimation,  Erythrocytes  Sedimentation  Rate  (ESR) 

,  Total 

121 

Erythrocytes  Count  (TEC),  Total  Leukocytes  count  (TLC)  ,  Differential  Leukocytes  Count 

122 

(DLC) , PCV was done by hematology analyzer. Serum biochemical tests including total serum 

123 

proteins, serum albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate 

124 

aminotransferase (AST) and gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) were done by serum chemistry 

125 

analyzer. The values obtained were compared with normal documented values (18). 

126 

2.5.DNA extraction and PCR for trypanosomiasis: 

127 

DNA  was  extracted  from  blood  samples  with  Tiangen  Genomic  DNA  extraction  kit  (Tiangen 

128 

Biotech,  Beijing,  China)  as  recommended  by  manufacturer.  PCR  was  performed  with  two  T. 

129 

evansi  specific  primer  sets  that  amplified  a  228  bp  region.  .T.  evansi  (F)  and  T.  evansi  (R) 

130 

primers were used in PCR in a final volume of 20 µL consisting of 2 µL of 10x PCR buffer (50 

131 

mM Tris-HCl; pH 8.5;  50 mM NaCl), 2  mM  MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.2 µM of each 

132 

primer, 5 U Taq Polymerase, 2 µL of DNA template (10 ng/µL) and distilled water. The DNA 

133 

was amplified with 5 min denaturation at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles (denaturation at 94°C for 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT134 

45 sec, annealing at 64.6°C for 1 min and extension at 72°C for 90 sec) and a final extension at 

135 

72°C for additional 10 min. 

136 

2.6.Surf Field Mastitis Test for subclinical Mastitis: 

137 

A 3% reagent solution of common detergent “Surf Excel” (Lever Brothers, Pvt. Ltd. Pakistan) 

138 

was prepared and slime or gel formation was noted for the positive subclinical test.  

139 

140 

2.7.BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION 

2.7.1.  Primary isolation of bacteria 

141 

Blood  agar  base,  melted  and  cooled  to  45  to  50°C,  5%  (vol/vol),  was  mixed  with  sterile 

142 

defibrinated blood by rotation. Each milk sample was streaked on sterile blood agar plates and 

143 

incubated at 37°C for 24-28 hours. The colonies grown were and examined as recommended by 

144 

the National  Mastitis Council (19).After examination of primary  growth smears from different 

145 

colonies were made and stained with Gram’s staining method followed by examination under the 

146 

microscope. 

147 

2.7.2.  Purification  and identification of  bacteria 

148 

The primary growth was purified by frequent sub-culturing on selective and differential media. 

149 

Mannitol salt agar ( Staphylococcus -110 medium) and blood agar  was used for purification and 

150 

differentiation of the primary isolates on the basis of cultural and morphological characteristics, 

151 

motility,  hemolytic  and  metabolic  properties  as  described  in  Bergeys  identification  chart. 

152 

Cultural character of shape, color, surface edge, structure and consistency of colonies for  various 

153 

isolates were recorded .  Staining Techniques used to identify bacteria were Gram Staining (20), 

154 

Spore  Staining  (21),  Capsule  staining  (22)  and  Acid  fast  staining  (23).The  shapes  and  

155 

arrangement of the organisms was recorded. Sterilized blood agar was poured into petri plates. 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT156 

These  plates  were  inoculated  with  each  test  organism  and  incubated  at  37˚C  for  24  hours  and 

157 

type of hemolysis (alpha, beta, and gamma) was recorded. 

158 

2.7.3.  Fermentation reaction / tests:  

159 

Glucose, Mannitol, Lactose and Sucrose were used in the tests. The inoculated tubes along with 

160 

control (un-inoculated) tubes were incubated at 37°C for specified period (24 to 48 hrs). These 

161 

tubes  were  observed  daily  for  the  presence  or  absence  of  acid  in  tubes  and  gas  formation  in 

162 

Durhams tubes. Change in color from red / pink to yellow indicated acid production. 

163 

2.7.4.  Biochemical tests: 

164 

Biochemical tests were used for the identification and characterization of bacteria Catalase test, 

165 

Nitrate  reduction  test,  Methyl  red  test,  Voges  Proskaur  test,  Indole  Production  Test,  Citrate 

166 

utilization test and Urease test. 

167 

2.8. Antibiogram: 

168 

Sensitivity of each isolated micro-organism against different antibacterial agents was tested on 

169 

Muller-  Hiton  agar,  supplemented  with  5%  sheep  blood,  by  disc  diffusion  method.  (24).  The 

170 

antibacterial  agents  discs  used  were,  Oxytetracycline,  Gentamicine,  Ampicilin,  Amoxacillin, 

171 

Penicillin,  Norfloxacin,  Cephradine,  Chloramphenicol  and  Streptomycin.  On  the  basis  of 

172 

diameter of inhibitory zone produced by each antibiotic, the sensitivity was recorded as Resistant 

173 

(R), Sensitive (S) and Intermediate (I). 

174 

3.  RESULTS: 

175 

Results of the present study on blood parasites showed that out of 300 blood samples 45 were 

176 

positive for Trypanosoma evansi while 15 camels showed Anaplasma infection revealing a total 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT177 

incidence of 15% and 5% for both blood parasites respectively. Out of 150 camels, 20 male and 

178 

30 female camels were positive for blood parasites. Data analysis regarding sex-wise prevalence 

179 

revealed that there was no statistically significant difference between male and female animals. 

180 

Age wise prevalence was 12.5, 17.4, 16.04 and 25.29% in <1 year, 1-2 years, 2-5 years and >5 

181 

years  respectively.  The  statistical  analysis  revealed  non-significant  difference  among  the 

182 

different age groups. The results indicated relatively higher incidence in camels of age group > 5 

183 

years as compared to the other age groups. Results of prevalence regarding sex and age are given 

184 

in table 2.  

185 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT186 

Hematological  studies  revealed  lower  values  of  hematocrit,  erythrocyte  count  and  hemoglobin 

187 

concentration and increased value of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Severe neutrophilia, 

188 

monocytosis, eosinophilia and leukocytosis were also recorded in infected camels as compared 

189 

to  healthy  camels.  Mean  values  of  albumin  and  serum  total  proteins  were  found  significantly 

190 

reduced  in  blood  parasite  affected  camels  when  compared  with  healthy  camels.  Serum 

191 

biochemical  tests  including  alanine  aminotransferase,  aspartate  aminotransferase,  gamma 

192 

glutamyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase also revealed significant difference among healthy 

193 

and infected animals. A PCR product of 228 bp for Trypanosoma evansi was amplified through 

194 

PCR as shown in Figure 1. 

195 

The  results  of  study  on  mastitis  showed  that  out  of  100  animals  42  samples  were  positive  for 

196 

subclinical  mastitis  on  surf  field  test.  Two  cases  of  clinical  mastitis  were  recorded  Sample 

197 

negative for SFMT were 56. Samples were scored Nil, one positive (+), two positive (++), Three 

198 

positive (+++) and four positive (++++) according to the severity of thickness of gel formation. 

199 

The  results  regarding  different  risk  factors  of  mastitis  like  nutrition,  body  condition,  Udder 

200 

hygiene, Use of teat dips before and after milking indicated that most of the camels investigated 

201 

during study were underfed with poor body condition. There was decreased trend use of pre and 

202 

post  teat.  There  was  trend  of  hand  washing  and  udder  washing  before  milking.  Milking  was 

203 

mostly done once daily. There was more percentage of subclinical mastitis in when the age was 

204 

above 10 years. The results were significantly different as p<0.05. The results are represented in 

205 

figures 2, 3 and 4 .

4.  DISCUSSION 

255 

Infectious diseases and particularly vector-borne protozoan diseases have been serious threat for 

256 

animal health and productivity in developing countries (25; 26; 27; 28). The overall prevalence 

257 

of trypanosomiasis and anaplasmosis during present study was 15% and 5% respectively which 

258 

is  in  accordance  with  the  previous  studies  in  Pakistan  (29).  Previously,  13.72%  trypanosomes 

259 

infection was recorded in camels  (19).  This difference in prevalence could be due to different 

260 

populations’ locations, sample size and prior treatment within the different areas of the country. 

261 

Present study  showed higher prevalence in above 4  years of age  as compared less than 3 to 4 

262 

years of age animals. Previous studies showed 9.67% and 11.25% prevalence respectively (30). 

263 

Some studies showed significantly low prevalence of 0.7 % in young camels in Pakistan (8). The 

264 

present study revealed relatively higher prevalence in camels of age group of above  5 years that 

265 

is also in accordance with the  previous studies (31).  The relatively higher prevalence of  blood 

266 

protozoan infection in older camels ,5 years of age and above,  could be attributed to the poor 

267 

management, movement from one place to another and heavy stress owing to the involvement of 

268 

this  age  group  in  transportation  (32).    The  results  also  revealed  statistically  non-significant 

269 

difference of infection in male and female animals. These findings are also in accordance to the 

270 

earlier  studies  conducted  in  Cholistan  desert  (33).  Conversely,  some  studies  have  reported 

271 

significantly  higher  prevalence  in  female  camels  (18;8;26)  as  compared  to  males  while  few 

272 

researchers have also reported higher prevalence in the male camels (34). In short, all sex wise 

273 

prevalence  findings about blood protozoa  showed  that both sexes are equally susceptible to the 

274 

disease. However, higher rates of infection in females could be due  to the physiological stress 

275 

leading  to  decreased  resistance  and  in  turn,  higher  vulnerability  to  the  infection.  In  contrast, 

276 

higher infection rates in males can be attributed to the increased physical work leading to fatigue 

277 

and  stress  (8).  The  lower  hematological  values  regarding  TEC,  PCV  and  Hb  concentrations 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT278 

observed in present study are suggestive of anemia. Anemia has already been reported in blood 

279 

parasite  positive  camels  and  is  considered  as  a  major  biomarker  of  these  infections  in  camels 

280 

(35).  The  higher  value  of  ESR  in  infected    camels  may  be  due  to  the  anemia  and    auto-

281 

agglutination that is  previously detected in this infection (36). Hematological examination in the 

282 

present study also revealed leukocytosis including neutrophilia, monocytosis,  and eosinophilia. 

283 

Similar results have been previously observed (37). Significantly decreased values of serum total 

284 

proteins and serum albumin while increased values of ALT, AST, GGT and ALP could be due to 

285 

centrilobular  degeneration  as  a  result  of  the  hypoxia  and  severe  oxidative  stress  induced  by 

286 

varying  severity  of      blood  parasitic  infection  indicating  liver  damage.  .  Similar  changes  also 

287 

have been reported in camels due to trypanosomiasis, previously (33). A PCR product of 228 bp 

288 

for  Trypanosoma  evansi  was  amplified  during  the  present  study  that  serves  as  mile  stone  for 

289 

vaccine development against trypanosomiasis in further studies.  

290 

Regarding mastitis the results demonstrated that camels above 9 years were most susceptible for 

291 

clinical condition that is due to high milk production at this age, with low numbers of somatic 

292 

cell counts. . . The unhygienic milking and poor management practices in the study area might 

293 

also have contributed to the high prevalence of mastitis in the camel herds examined during the 

294 

present study.  The  Gram-positive cocci were the  main pathogens isolated from infected camel 

295 

milk samples. Many authors also reported that these pathogens are major mastitis causing agents 

296 

in she-camels with mastitis (13). The results of present study indicate that Staphylococcus aureus 

297 

was  the  main  isolated  bacterium  (52.3%)  in  subclinical  mastitis  of  animals  indicating  the 

298 

environmental  distribution  of  this  organism.  Isolation  of  the  etiological  agent  Staphylococcus 

299 

spp, Streptococcus spp and corynebacterium   from mastitis cases was also previously reported 

300 

(13) in Pakistan. During the present study Streptococcus agalactiae were also the second most 

301 

common causes of camel mastitis. Strep. dysagalactiae ,Corynebacterium spp and Bacillus spp 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT302 

were also isolated in the present study  from  infected camel  milk. These  isolated bacteria have 

303 

also  reported  to  be  zoonotic  in  many  reports  worldwide.  Previous  and  present  reports  of  the 

304 

above  cited  bacteria  from  camel  milk  also  points  to  the  growing  concerns  of  antimicrobial 

305 

resistance.  The  indiscriminate  use  of  unprescribed  antimicrobial  drugs  for  disease  control  in 

306 

camels  is  suspected  to  play  a  role  in  the  spread  and  persistence  of  antimicrobial-resistant 

307 

zoonotic bacteria. The most effective antibiotics, recorded by antibiogram in present study, were 

308 

Gentamicin, Norfloxacin, Oxytetracycline . However, previous studies have shown Norfloxacin 

309 

and Chloramphenicol were the most effective drugs (38). 

310 

311 

5.  CONCLUSION  

From  the  findings  of  this  study  it  can  be  concluded  that  trypanosomiasis  and 

312 

anaplasmosis    are  present  in  desert  conditions  of  Pakistan  and  cause  disparities  in  various 

313 

hematological as well as biochemical parameters of camels. The results showed that acaricidal 

314 

use  must be communicated to camel owners in  southern Punjab through appropriate extension 

315 

methods and tools.    Staphylococcus aureus was dominant cause of sub-clinical mastitis.  It was 

316 

attributed to inadequate hygienic condition of environment. The isolation of genera of pathogenic 

317 

bacteria from the camel milk samples suggests the need for strict hygienic measures during the 

318 

production and handling of camel milk to reduce public health hazards.  Thus, good management 

319 

practices with proper sanitation and is required to prevent the incidence of mammary infection in 

320 

camels  in  the  study  areas.  Education  of  the  camel  owners  about  the  importance  of  hygienic 

321 

milking practices would minimize mastitis. It is beneficial if the lactating camels in the herd are 

322 

screened  regularly  to  diagnose  sub-clinical  mastitis  and  to  achieve  maximum  milk  production.  

323 

Correct and good milking techniques are essential in the prevention of both environmental and 

324 

contagious  mastitis.  The  recommended  screening  and  milking  protocol  must  be  implemented. 

325 

Norfloxacin,  Gentamycin,  and  Oxytetracyclin  were  most  effective  drugs  against  all  isolates 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT326 

during  the  present  study  but  antibiotic  policy  need  to  be  devised  and  implemented  to  avoid 

327 

present and future problem of antibiotic resistance in camels of Southern Punjab in Pakistan.
