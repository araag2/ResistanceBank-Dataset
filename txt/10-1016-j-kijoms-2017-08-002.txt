Abstract

A study was carried out in abattoirs to identify certain bacterial Ô¨Çora in a number of samples collected from ewes' uteri with detection
of phenotypic and genotypic antibiotic resistance patterns of the identiÔ¨Åed bacteria. The study was done in the South of Iraq during a
period that started in February and ended in March 2015. Seventy-nine samples were collected randomly and aseptically, examined
grossly, cultured using standard bacteriological techniques and examined for antibiotic resistance. Thirty-one isolates were reported
belong to the following bacteria with resistance percentages accordingly: Escherichia coli 41. 94% (No: 13), Klebsiella spp. 29.03%
(No: 9), Enterobacter spp. 16.13% (No: 5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 6.45% (No: 2) and Proteus spp. 6.45% (No: 2). Results revealed
that 100% (No: 31) of isolates were resistant to oxacillin while resistance to both ampicillin and tetracycline appeared in 93.64% (No:
30), 41.92% (No: 13) of isolates respectively, moreover there was for some extent resistance to ceftriaxone 9.68% (No: 3), while the
isolates were highly susceptible to cefamandole and gentamicin. The isolates were also examined to determine the presence of blaSHV
genes by PCR assay which showed that 12.9% of isolates harbored this gene. This study contributes to a better knowledge about
identiÔ¨Åed bacterial species inhabiting the uterus of ewes and exerting a signiÔ¨Åcant and distinct antimicrobial resistance pattern.

behave in a different manner from normal vaginal Ô¨Çora
to a pathogenic agents [1,2]. An effective control of
postpartum contamination of the uterus provides the
opportunity to improve both fertility and general health
condition of ewes and other ruminant animals; how-
ever, the uterus of ruminants is usually contaminated
with different microÔ¨Çora in the immediate postpartum
period [3].

It has been reported that goats have many microÔ¨Çora
in their genitalia and recorded that these microÔ¨Çora are
usually harmless but certain predisposing factors such

as trauma or another infection can drive them to a
pathogenic state and disease causing agents [4].

There are also other pathogens which are harmless in
normal situation but can be converted to a more patho-
genic form when favorable conditions are available in the
reproductive tract such bacteria as coliform bacteria and
other non-speciÔ¨Åc bacteria under stressful conditions,
may cause genital infection that usually leads to repro-
ductive failure in dairy cows, sheep and goats [5,6,7].
Different types of bacteria have been isolated from the
genitalia of the doe and these include (Staphylococci,
Streptococci, Actinomyces, Pseudomonas, Escherichia
coli, Mycoplasma and Brucella) species [8].

The importance of studying such microorganisms is
related to diseases caused by them due to reduction of the
immunity of the reproductive system [9]. Several studies
mentioned that there were several types of bacteria found
in the reproductive tract [10e13]. Several studies have
been made in Iraq which focused on isolation of certain
microorganisms behaving as an opportunistic bacteria in
uteri of different animals [14e16].

Many researchers indicated that the reproductive

system contains normal Ô¨Çora [17e21].

Beta-lactamases are enzymes that are major causes
of bacterial resistance to the beta-lactam family of
antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins, cepha-
mycins, and carbapenems. These enzymes catalyze the
hydrolysis of the amide bond of four membered beta-
lactam ring and render the antibiotic inactive against
its original cellular target, the cell wall transpeptidase.
On the basis of their primary structure, beta-lactamases
are grouped into four classes A, B, C, and D enzymes.
Enzymes of classes A, C, and D have serine at the
active site, whereas the class B enzymes are zinc-
metallo enzymes. Extended-spectrum beta-lactam an-
tibiotics have widely been used for treatment of serious
Gram-negative infections.

of

However, bacterial resistance has emerged due to
production
extended-spectrum beta-lactamases
(ESBLs). These enzymes are capable of hydrolyzing
extended-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics such as pen-
icillins, cephalosporins along with a monobactam
(aztreonam) but are inhibited by beta-lactamase in-
hibitors such as clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazo-
bactam. ESBLs are derived from genes for the Narrow
spectrum beta-lactamases (TEM-1, TEM-2, or SHV-1)
by mutations that alter the amino acid conÔ¨Åguration
around the enzyme active site. They are typically enco-
ded by plasmids that can be exchanged readily between
bacterial species. These enzymes are most commonly
produced by the members of the Enterobacteriaceae,
especially E. coli and Klebsiella. To date, more than 350

different natural ESBL variants are known that have been
classiÔ¨Åed into nine distinct structural and evolutionary
families based upon their amino acid sequence compar-
isons such as TEM, SHV, CTX-M, PER, VEB, GES,
BES, TLA, and OXA [22e25].

Modern biological

techniques for detection of
antibacterial resistance have been rarely applied to
study of the distribution of resistance. This study aimed
to identify certain Ô¨Çora resident in the uterus of ewes
and study some phenotypic traits and occurrence rate
of blaSHV genes among the identiÔ¨Åed bacteria.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Samples collection

uterine

sample

collection

A total of seventy-nine uteri were collected from
ewes immediately after slaughtering, and instantly
transported to the laboratory in sterile polythene bags.
The
processes were
compatible to standard techniques described [26,27].
The surface of the uterus was sterilized by shearing the
uterine wall with a preheated surgical blade then the
uterine wall was lanced with another sterile blade and a
sterile swab stick was inserted and rolled over into the
uterine lumen to collect bacteriological samples.

2.2. Isolation and identiÔ¨Åcation

Samples were cultured on selective and differential
MacConkey agar (Merck, Germany) and the isolates
were identiÔ¨Åed based on their ability to ferment
lactose. Cultural and morphological characteristics of
colonies such as the shape, size, consistency and color
and Gram's stain had been performed; moreover, the
biochemical tests such as IMViC tests (indol produc-
tion, Methylred, Voges-Proskauer and Citrate utiliza-
tion), catalase, oxidase, phenyldeaminase and motility
were performed by which different bacteria have been
identiÔ¨Åed [28,29].

2.3. Antimicrobial susceptibility test

Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed
using a disk diffusion method described by Bauer et al.
(1966) [30] using Mueller-Hinton agar (Oxoid, U.K.).
Six antibiotic disks containing Ampicillin (10 mg),
Ceftriaxone (30 mg), Cefamandole (30 mg), Gentamycin
(30 mg) Oxacillin (1 mg) and tetracycline (30 mg) have
been used. The susceptibility breakpoints for all anti-
microbials were recommended by Clinical and Labo-
ratory Standards Institute CLSI [31].

2.4. Plasmidic DNA extraction and Polymerase Chain
Reaction

Plasmidic DNA was extracted from bacterial cells
using High-Speed Plasmid Mini Kit (Geneaid, South
Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Detection of antibiotic resistance-conferring genes was
performed by amplifying the blaSHV gene by PCR
using the following primers pair: Forward: TCA GCG
AAA AAC ACC TTG and Reverse: TCC CGC AGA
TAA ATC ACC which were previously suggested by
Ref. [32] with expected amplicon lengths of 471 bp.
AmpliÔ¨Åcation was performed in a Sure cycler 8800
(Agilent, USA), For PCR blaSHV ampliÔ¨Åcation cycle
conditions included an initial denaturation cycle at
high temperature 94
C for 2 min, then 30 cycles
(denaturation temperature 94
C for 1 min, annealing
temperature 58
C for 1 min and elongation tempera-
ture 72
C for 1 min) followed by Ô¨Ånal elongation
temperature 72

C for 7 min.

rence of 13 (41.94%) followed by Klebsiella spp. 9
(29.03%), Enterobacter spp. with 5 (16.13%), Pseu-
domonas aeruginosa were 2 (6.45%) and Proteus spp.
with 2 (6.45%) as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1.

3.2. Antibiotic susceptibility proÔ¨Åle

As shown in Table 2 and Fig. 2 susceptibility of
identiÔ¨Åed bacteria by disk diffusion test reported less
activity of oxacillin and ampicillin with 31 (100%) and
30 (96.77%) resistant to these antibiotics, respectively,
followed by tetracycline 13 (41.94%). The resistance
to ceftriaxone was recorded in 3 (9.68%) of isolates
while the most active antibiotics against isolates were
cefamandole and Gentamicin with 0 (0%) of resistance
was reported.

3.3. The result of molecular study

The concentration of reagents in PCR reaction
mixture was 1X PCR Buffer, 2 mM of MgCl2 (Invi-
trogen, USA), 0.4 mM of each forward and reverse
primers, 0.2 mM of dNTP mix (Promega, USA),
0.04 U/ml of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen, USA) and
15 ng/ml of DNA template in a Ô¨Ånal volume of 25 ml.

The result of molecular study revealed that 12.9%
of isolates were carried blaSHV genes where there was
a high rate of recovered genes detected in E. coli
followed by Klebsiella spp.
(6.45%)
(3.225%) (No ¬º 1) and Enterobacter spp. (3.225%)
(No ¬º 1) as shown in Fig. 3.

2.5. Gel Documentation

4. Discussion

The ampliÔ¨Åed PCR product was separated on a 1%
agarose gel and visualized with a UV transilluminator
after ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/ml) staining. Gels were
electrophoresed in 1X TBE buffer at constant voltage of
75 volts for 90 min. The sizes of the DNA fragments were
measured according to 100 bp DNA ladder (Geneaid,
South Korea) The gel was visualized and photographed
under UV light using a digital imaging system.

2.6. Statistical procedure

The statistical analysis was performed by using the
Pearson Chi-square test and the analysis of variance
(ANOVA). Data were analyzed using SPSS 17.0
(Chicago, IL, USA). Furthermore, the differences were
signiÔ¨Åcant at (P < 0.05).

The normal microbial Ô¨Çora of the uterus develops as
the animal encounters and responds to a number of
environmental and physiological conditions, moreover
opportunistic secondary invaders from the vagina
frequently attack the uterus during the peripartum
period causing metritis, endometritis and subsequent
reduction in the reproductive capacities [33,34].

Bacterial identiÔ¨Åcation is thus an important part for
restore

interventions that will

providing remedial
fertility.

The Iraqi ewes were studied by the researches
[26,35] who found that most of ewes
reproductive
systems contain normal Ô¨Çora, while in the goat as re-
ported by Refs. [36,37] non speciÔ¨Åc infections appear
to play a role in causing infertility in does.

The result of this study conÔ¨Årmed prevalence of
Gram negative bacterial species in the uterus of
slaughtered sheep including E. coli, Klebsiella spp.,
Enterobacter spp., P. aeruginosa. and Proteus spp.
which is also in accordance with previous studies [38].
A similar study was conducted in Al-Hillah city by

Ref. [39] to isolate and identify bacterial Ô¨Çora from
vagina in normal ewes (slaughtered and while live)
where they found that E. coli was the predominant
isolated bacteria followed by Proteus mirabilis and
Klebsiella pneumoniae. Other studies have reported
that Bacillus spp., Corynebacterium spp., Escherichia
spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. are
commonly isolated from the ewes' vagina. On the other
hand [41] explained that staphylococcus was most
predominant identiÔ¨Åed bacteria followed by bacillus,
E. coli, and Pseudomonas [40], another study [42]
showed that E. coli, Arcanobacterium pyogenes,
Staphylococci and Streptococci spp. were the most
dominant bacteria in the uteri of ewes [41]. Other

reports have indicated that E. coli and Staphylococcus
aureus are the most commonly isolated bacteria from
slaughtered ewes in Nigeria [42].

Beta-lactam antimicrobial agents are considered
Ô¨Årst-line agents in treating bacterial infections however
resistance to b-lactam antibiotics among Gram nega-
tive bacteria has proven to be tough challenge for re-
searchers and clinicians. Considering the results of
antibiotic resistance pattern to bacterial isolates, cefa-
mandole and gentamicin exhibited very good activity,

with 0% of resistance, where rates of resistance in the
range of (9.68%) for Ceftriaxone and 43.75%, for
tetracycline have been described. In general ampicillin
and oxacillin had the less activity against isolates with
resistance reached to 100% and 96.87%, respectively.
Similar, observations were recorded earlier by others
[43].

BlaSHV are considered common b-lactamases
detected in clinical isolates of E. coli and Klebsiella
spp. predisposing animals
to genitourinary tract

infections [44]. In the present study, 12.9% bacterial
Ô¨Çora harbored blaSHV genes with high rate of occur-
rence in E. coli followed by Klebsiella spp. and
Enterobacter spp.

In a study of a collection of E. coli isolates recov-
ered from hospitalized animals in Ireland results
showed that blaSHV genes were always accompanied
by blaTEM and 4 of 5 isolates that were positive for
both of these genes were resistant to ampicillin, cef-
podoxime, ceftiofur, and cephalothin [45].

Antimicrobial use in production animals has been
shown to lead to the emergence of resistant bacteria.
The use of low doses of antibiotics by the modern food
animal
industry as growth-promoting substances in
farm animals to promote animal growth and to prevent
infections rather than cure infections is responsible for
drug-resistant bacteria emerging on farms which reach
the general population through human or animal car-
riers, and through the food consumers eat [46]. Also
the misuse and overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics,
mainly cephalosporins, must be contributing to selec-
tion and spread of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae
in animals.

become a common problem in veterinary medicine
across the world. These enzymes have been identiÔ¨Åed
in a wide range of Enterobacteriaceae, including K.

Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Serratia
spp., Shigella spp., Citrobacter spp., and Salmonella
species [47,48] around the world which strongly
agreed with the results of this study which were sup-

While acquisition of ESBLs confers resistance to
penicillins, cephalosporins and monobactams, isolates
remain susceptible to carbapenems, and in vitro, these
enzymes are inhibited by beta-lactamase inhibitors,
such as clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam
[49] this might be due to the fact that these genes
encoding for these enzymes including blaSHV genes
carried on conjugative plasmid play role in acquisition
of resistance by horizontal gene transfer.

ESBL-encoding genes are often carried on plas-
mids, which can easily be transferred between isolates,
bearing additional resistance determinants for other
classes

roquinolones,
and sulfonamides,
contributing to the multidrug-resistant phenotype [50].

of

Most reports of ESBL positive GNB isolated from
pets come from Europe. In 1998, for the Ô¨Årst time a
resistant E. coli strain was isolated from a urine
specimen from a dog with a recurrent urinary tract
infection (UTI), in Madrid, Spain. This strain showed
resistance to amoxicillin, cephalothin, cefotaxime,
ceftazidime, and aztreonam and the ESBL enzyme was
conÔ¨Årmed as SHV-12 variant [51].

In the United States, the largest threat from ESBLs
has come from Salmonella spp. and E. coli. In 2007
[52] found Salmonella enterica harboring CTX-M,
SHV, TEM and CMY-2 b-lactamases. From 1999 to
2003, 34,411 Salmonella spp. strains were isolated
from cattle, birds, horses and dogs and the proportion
isolates for each Salmonella

serotype varied widely.

in Australia have been
identiÔ¨Åed in Enterobacter spp. isolated from dogs with

infection, osteomyelitis and multiple abscess) [53].

infections

The Ô¨Årst report of ESBL was published by Ref. [54],
where S. enterica serovar Newport expressing TEM-
1B and SHV-12 was isolated from affected animals
during an outbreak of salmonellosis that led to a 3-
month closure of one of the largest equine hospitals
in the United States.

The Ô¨Årst reports of ESBL-producing bacteria in
poultry were performed in Europe. In this regard, in
Spain, E. coli strains isolated from faecal samples of
healthy and sick poultry were found to harbor blaCTX-
M-14, blaCTX-M-9, or blaSHV-12 [55].

Standard microbiological procedures can take up to
several days for culture, isolation and characterization
and many comparative studies have shown that PCR-
based methods have higher sensitivity [56,57], mostly
due to variable levels of gene expression. Therefore,
PCR and nucleotide sequence analysis [58], together
with various PCR-based methods, remain the gold
standard for extended-spectrum b-lactamase SHV-var-
iants identiÔ¨Åcation.

5. Conclusion

It was concluded that E. coli, Enterobacter spp.
Klebsiella spp. P. aeruginosa and Proteus spp. were
the most common gram negative members of the
normal Ô¨Çora in uterine ewe's samples. These organisms
were resistant to different antibiotics and there was
high rate of resistance to blaSHV genes carried by
identiÔ¨Åed bacteria. Further investigations are needed to
reveal antibiotic sensitivity pattern of the isolates
