Impacts
• Escherichia coli (E. coli) from neonatal diarrhoea in calves carry genes
and have biochemical properties (urease production) responsible for
human disease and thus may be an important source of infection to
humans as they are present in the faeces of the calves.

• Different E. coli serogroups showed multiple antibiotic resistance so

that the indiscriminate use of antibiotics may lead to the development
of drug resistance in bacteria thus making treatment difficult.

• Certain serogroups like O2, O55, O86, O128 and O157 isolated in

this study have been found to be associated with human diseases and
thus may pose a public health hazard.

Summary

This study was designed to investigate the antibiotic resistance, colicinogeny,
serotyping and atypical biochemical characteristics of 41 Shiga toxin-producing
Escherichia coli (STEC) strains detected using polymerase chain reaction from
90 E. coli strains isolated from 46 diarrhoeic calves. The STEC strains belonged
to 14 different serogroups. Seventeen per cent of the STEC strains carried the
eaeA gene while 14.28% of the 49 non-STEC strains were eaeA positive. Twenty
eight (68.29%) of the 41 STEC strains were rhamnose non-fermentors. All the
STEC strains revealed resistance to at least three of the antibiotics tested. 100%
resistance was found against kanamycin and cephalexin followed by cephalori-
dine, enroﬂoxacin, amikacin, ampicillin, tetracycline, ceftiofur, ciproﬂoxacin,
colistin and co-trimoxazole. Eighteen (44%) of the STEC strains produced coli-
cin and all these colicinogenic strains were resistant to three or more antibiot-
ics. Eleven STEC strains (26.82%) showed urease activity. The results of this
study suggest that diarrhoeic calves are an important reservoir of STEC strains
that are potentially pathogenic for farm animals and humans. Moreover, rham-
nose fermentation, colicinogeny and atypical biochemical behaviour, such as
urease activity, may serve as important markers or diagnostic tools for epide-
miological surveys to trace the source of infection in disease outbreaks.

Introduction

The emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial-resis-
tant Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) zoo-
notic bacteria in food-producing animals pose a global

public health hazard because of potential transmission
from animals to humans. The recently published WHO
guidelines regarding control of antimicrobials in food ani-
mals (WHO, 2000) echo the grave concerns pertaining to
antibiotic resistance in food animals. These guidelines aim

at the judicious use of antimicrobials in food animals
and at establishing mechanisms to monitor the anti-
microbial resistance in food-borne pathogens of zoonotic
importance.

Escherichia coli (E. coli) is one of the leading causes of
neonatal calf diarrhoea which frequently results in sub-
stantial economic loss in the dairy industry (Bradford
et al., 1999; Wray et al., 1993). Shiga toxin-producing
E. coli are well recognized in colibacillosis in neonatal
calves. Even though many studies
showed that both
healthy and diarrhoeic calves harbour STEC in their
intestine, natural outbreaks and experimental conditions
have demonstrated the association of STEC with diar-
rhoea and dysentery in calves (Hall et al., 1985; Schoon-
derwoerd et al., 1988; Sandhu and Gyles, 2002). Cattle,
both dairy and beef herd, have been implicated as the
principal reservoir of STEC (Cobbold and Desmarchelier,
2000; Thran et al., 2001). In humans, STEC can cause
severe diseases, such as haemorrhagic colitis (HC) and
haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) which is the main
cause of acute renal
failure in children (Grifﬁn and
Tauxe, 1991). In addition to Shiga toxin production, inti-
min, encoded by the eaeA gene, is another virulence-asso-
ciated factor that has been implicated in patients with HC
and HUS (Paton and Paton, 1998). Indeed, enteropatho-
genic E. coli (EPEC) that result in attaching and effacing
(AE) lesions but do not produce Shiga toxin, have been
isolated as the causal agent of diarrhoea in humans and
different animal species (Mainil, 1999; Cid et al., 2001).
Although O157:H7 is the dominant serotype associated
with human disease worldwide, sporadic cases of HC and
HUS are increasingly being attributed to non-O157 STEC
serotypes in many countries (Mercado et al., 2004; Brooks
et al.,2005; Aidar-Ugrinovich et al., 2007). In addition,
several authors have found that STEC isolated from diar-
rhoeic calves frequently share virulence-associated traits,
i.e. genes with human enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC)
strains (Maidhof et al., 2002).

such as

In the past few years, E. coli strains isolated from diar-
rhoeic calves have shown resistance to multiple, structur-
ally unrelated antibiotics,
aminoglycosides,
ﬂuoroquinolones and expanded-spectrum cephalosporins
(White et al., 1997, 2000; Bradford et al., 1999). More-
over, some of the quinolones can enhance the production
of Shiga toxin by induction of bacteriophage via bacterial
SOS response and induce stx-phages
to lytic cycles
thereby facilitating their dissemination in the environ-
ment (Zhang et al., 2000). The emergence of such multi-
drug-resistant pathogenic strains of E.
coli poses an
increasing threat to the successful management of calf
scours (Donaldson et al., 2006). Some researchers have
speculated that the indiscriminate use of antibiotics in
food-producing animals may lead to the development of

antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic bacteria infecting
humans (Aarestrup and Wegener, 1999; Van den Bogaard
and Stobberingh, 1999; Wegener, 2003).

However, data on antimicrobial resistance of STEC in
food-producing animals is still scarce and an efﬁcient sur-
vey of antimicrobial resistance in STEC would be helpful in
the treatment and management of disease both in cattle
and humans. Although E. coli strains are usually negative
for urease (Edwing, 1986), phenotypic variants of E. coli
serotypes O157:H7 and non-O157, STEC urease-producing
strains have been reported (Tschape et al., 1995) and urease
activity can be considered as a putative virulence factor of
increasing importance in STEC infecting cattle and humans
(Heimer et al., 2002). A positive correlation in production
of colicins and pathogenicity of E. coli from diarrhoeic
calves has also been reported (Harnett and Gyles, 1984;
Singh et al., 1989). Here, we discuss the prevalence of STEC
and non-STEC eaeA-positive strains in diarrhoeic calves in
Gujarat, a leading dairy industry state of India, together
with atypical biochemical characteristics and antimicrobial
resistance. This is the ﬁrst survey of STEC strains in
diarrhoeic calves in Gujarat state of India.

Materials and Methods

Calves
This study was carried out
from November 2004 to
February 2005. In this period, around ﬁve hundred calves
(below 2 months of age) from four different locations viz.
two Livestock Research Stations one each from the Anand
Agricultural University (AAU) and the Junagadh Agricul-
tural University, clinical cases reported at veterinary clin-
ics of AAU and small household farms around the Anand
city of Gujarat state, India, were investigated, so that iso-
lates represent
the actual prevailing animal husbandry
practices across the state. Calves were screened for diar-
rhoea and clinical cases from different settings,
i.e. 30
from two Livestock Research Stations of the universities
and 16 from veterinary clinics AAU and small household
farms were further selected for faecal sampling. A total of
46 calves showing symptoms of diarrhoea were selected.

Samples

swabs or faeces
Samples (n = 46) consisted of rectal
collected from each diarrhoeic
calf using Hiculture
(HiMedia, Mumbai, India) sterile swabs. Inoculated swabs
were transported on ice to the laboratory.

Isolation and identiﬁcation of E. coli

All faecal samples were streaked onto MacConkey’s agar
and incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Five to six lactose

fermenting pink colonies per sample were picked and
subcultured on eosin methylene blue (EMB) agar plates
for preliminary characterization. Colonies showing the
characteristic metallic sheen on EMB agar (two well iso-
lated colonies) were picked and considered presumptive
E. coli. The puriﬁed cultures of E. coli were inoculated on
phosphate buffer agar stabs. E. coli isolates were prelimi-
narily identiﬁed by biochemical tests; indole, methyl-red,
Voges-Proskaeur and citrate utilization. The isolates were
further characterized for their biochemical activity by the
following tests; carbohydrate fermentation, urea hydroly-
sis, production of hydrogen sulphide on TSI agar as per
Edwing (1986). Thus in total 90 E. coli strains were
isolated.

Detection of stx1, stx2 and eaeA genes by PCR

All the E. coli strains were screened for the presence of
the stx1, stx2 and eaeA genes as described by Pollard et al.
(1990) and Nishikawa et al. (2002) with some modiﬁca-
tions. PCR was performed in a thermal cycler (Eppendorf
thermal
cycler, Hamburg, Germany). Oligonucleotide
primers were procured from Sigma Aldrich Chemicals,
Bangalore, India. The primers and the predicted lengths
of PCR ampliﬁcation products are listed in Table 1.

The PCR assay was carried out in a 15 ll volume con-
taining 7.5 ll of 2X PCR Mastermix (4 mm MgCl2,
0.4 mm of each dNTPs, 0.05 units/ml of Taq DNA poly-
merase, 150 mm Tris–HCl PCR buffer) from Fermentas
Life Sciences, 0.5 ll of each primer (10 pmol/ll), 5.5 ll
Dnase-free distilled water and 1.0 ll of template DNA
(30 ng/ll). A known stx1 and stx2 positive E. coli O157
strain maintained at the department of Veterinary Micro-
biology, AAU, Anand, Gujarat served as a positive control
for the PCR. The thermal cycling programme for the
PCR used in this study is shown in Table 1. Ampliﬁed
PCR products were analysed by gel electrophoresis in 2%
agarose containing ethidium bromide (0.5 lg/ml) as
described earlier (Sambrook and Russell, 2001).

Serogrouping of E. coli

Isolated E. coli strains were serogrouped on the basis of
their ‘O’ antigen by the National Salmonella and Escheri-
chia Centre at Central Research Institute (Kasauli, India).

Carbohydrate fermentation tests of E. coli

The ability of the E. coli
isolates to ferment dulcitol,
rafﬁnose, rhamnose, salicin, starch and sucrose was assessed
using 1% of each sugar in a peptone water base with
Andrade’s indicator. Isolates grown in peptone water were
used to inoculate each sugar medium. The tubes were

Colicin production of E. coli strains

The colicinogenicity of the isolated E. coli strains was
assessed according to the method of Barker and Old
(1979) with some modiﬁcations. Dextrose free bile salt
agar (1.3%) was inoculated with the isolated strains. After
48 h of incubation at 37°C, the organisms were killed by
treatment with chloroform vapours for 30 min and the
plate overlaid with a thin layer of soft agar lightly inocu-
lated with an overnight broth culture of the indicator
strain (E. coli K-12 Row, maintained at department of
Microbiology, College of Veterinary Science, AAU Guja-
rat, India). After solidiﬁcation the plate was again incu-
bated overnight at 37°C. The production of colicin was
marked by a distinct inhibition zone in the lawn of the
indicator bacteria around the macro colony of
the
producer.

Atypical biochemical characterization of E. coli strains

Urease production: 2% of urea agar slants were inocu-
lated and incubated at 37°C and observed for 7 days. A
positive reaction was observed by the development of the
pink colour in the slant (Barrow and Feltham, 1993).

Sensitivity to antibiotics was determined by the agar
diffusion technique
et al.
(1966). Disks (HiMedia) containing the following agents
were used: ampicillin (10 lg), amikacin (30 lg), ceftio-
fur (0.2 lg), cephalexin (30 lg), cephaloridine (10 lg),
colistin (10 lg),
co-trimoxazole
(25 lg), enroﬂoxacin (10 lg), kanamycin (30 lg) and
tetracycline (30 lg). A sterile cotton swab was dipped
into the bacterial suspension and spread uniformly on
the entire surface of a Muller-Hinton agar plate. The
inoculum was allowed to dry for 5 min. Four antibiotic
disks were placed on the plate and after incubation for
24 h at 37°C the diameter of the inhibition zone was
measured in millimetres with calipers. Zones of growth
inhibition were evaluated according to the National
Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS,
1997) guidelines.

one or more sugars while 14 strains (34%) failed to ferment
any sugar. All the STEC strains revealed multiple drug
resistance to 3–10 different antibiotics (Table 3). The most
frequent resistance types were kanamycin (100%), cepha-
lexin (100%) followed by cephaloridine (95%), enroﬂoxa-
cin (85%), amikacin (80%), ampicillin (73%), tetracycline

Discussion

This study demonstrates the presence of stx and eaeA
genes among E. coli isolated from diarrhoeic calves. As
this study targeted only diarrhoeic calves most likely to
excrete the pathogen,
this prevalence rate cannot be
extrapolated to healthy calves or cattle on farms. Unlike
in developed countries, dairy cattle farming in India is a
household practice. Considering routine contacts with

STEC from Diarrhoeic Calves

G. Arya et al.

cattle in day-to-day life, a large human population in this
region may be at risk.

In this study we found a total of 41 strains (45.55%)
positive for stx genes. Similar results of a high percentage
(40% or more) of stx gene positive E. coli strains have
been reported by Khan et al. (2002) and Salvadori et al.
(2003), but this is in contrast to the ﬁndings of Wani
et al. (2003) from India who reported STEC-positive
strains only in 9.73% of the diarrhoeic calves. Isolation of
STEC O157 serogroup from calves with diarrhoea, in the
present work,
is in agreement with ﬁndings of Dean-
Nystrom et al. (1999), Wani et al. (2003) and Sharma
et al. (2004) who also found O157 serogroup as the cause
of severe diarrhoea and attaching and effacing mucosal
lesions in neonatal calves. The prevalence of stx genes
among 39 non-O157 (42.85%) strains was measured in
this study. Similar ﬁndings have been reported by Rah-
man (2002), Blanco et al. (2003) and Mercado et al.
(2004). The majority of the STEC strains isolated in this
study did not belong to the serogroups (O8, O20, O26,
O111, O113, O126, O145), which have previously been
found associated mainly with diarrhoea and enteritis in
calves outside India (Mainil, 1999). The serogroups most
commonly reported in India from calf diarrhoeal cases
are O24 (Kaura et al., 1991), O2, O5, O9, O62, O55,
O86, O131, O157 (Wani et al., 2003) and O172 (Sharma
et al., 2004). Furthermore, certain serogroups like O2,
O55, O86, O128 and O157 isolated in this study have
been found to be associated with infantile diarrhoea
among neonates and adult human patients suffering from
bloody diarrhoea/HC and/or HUS as reported by Beutin
et al. (1989) and Nishikawa et al. (2002). Thus these sero-
groups have a great importance in public health. Four of
the 41 STEC strains serotyped in this study were consid-
ered O non-typable (ONT) with all available O antisera
(O1 to O185). Similarly Aidar-Ugrinovich et al. (2007)
found six ONT of 55 STEC strains. This highlights the
need of extending the serotyping scheme to include new
and emerging STEC serogroups.
in this
study, we have identiﬁed three new serogroups (O167,
O168 and O172) previously unreported in either human
or animal STEC strains.

Interestingly,

In this study, we observed that the stx2 gene was more
prevalent
than the stx1, while the eaeA gene, which
encodes intimin, a 94- to 97-kDa outer membrane pro-
tein necessary for attaching and effacing activity (Paton
and Paton, 1998), was almost uniformly associated with
the distribution of stx1 and stx2 genes in bovine STEC
strains. This is in contrast with earlier reports that most
STEC strains from calves with diarrhoea harbour the stx1
gene along with the eaeA gene (Mainil et al., 1993; Wieler
et al., 1996) but in agreement with the ﬁndings of Wani
et al. (2003) from India who have reported a similar

pattern in diarrhoeic calves. Several other investigators
have underlined the strong association between the pres-
ence of the eaeA gene and the capacity of STEC to cause
severe human disease, especially HUS (Paton and Paton,
1998; Oswald et al., 2000; Beutin et al., 2004). This
important virulence gene was detected in 17% of the
STEC strains assayed in this study and is in contrast with
the results described for bovine isolates by Aidar-Ugrino-
vich et al. (2007). Nevertheless, the production of intimin
is not essential for pathogenesis because a number of spo-
radic cases of HUS have been caused by eaeA-negative
non-O157 STEC strains. Thus, STEC O104:H21 and
O113:H21 strains lacking eaeA gene were responsible for
an outbreak and a cluster of three HUS cases in the USA
and Australia respectively (Paton and Paton, 1998; Paton
et al., 1999).

The virulence gene stx2 has been found to be signiﬁ-
cantly associated with an increased risk of HUS in
humans infected with non-O157 STEC in the USA and
UK (Brooks et al., 2005). So the high prevalence of stx2
genes alone or in combinations with stx1 may be a potent
threat to the public health of farm workers and people
living in the vicinity of animal farms. Further studies in
this direction are needed.

In this study, non-STEC eaeA-positive strains were
detected in seven (14.28%) of 49 non-STEC strains,
which is close to the ﬁndings of Orden et al. (1998) and
Wani et al. (2003) who, respectively, detected non-STEC
eaeA-positive strains in 8.1% and 9.73% of calves with
diarrhoea. Non-STEC eaeA-positive strains in this study
belonged to O18 (2 strains), O26 (2 strains), O76 (1
strain), O126 (1 strain) and ONT (1 strain) serogroups
with predominant prevalence of O18 and O26 (28.57%
each). This corroborates the observation of Orden et al.
(1998) that the O26 serogroup was the most prevalent
(29.4%) among EPEC from calves with diarrhoea in
Spain. Moreover, Mainil et al. (1993) found that all EPEC
strains isolated from calves with diarrhoea, except for one
that could not be typed, belonged to this serogroup. Sim-
ilarly, the O26 serogroup has been detected more fre-
quently in calves with diarrhoea than in healthy cattle
suggesting a pathogenic role in neonatal calf diarrhoea
(Orden et al., 1998).

In this study, a multiple drug resistance pattern (at
least against three antibiotics) was observed in isolated
strains. All the strains were resistant to at least three anti-
biotics tested, with 20 of 41 isolates (49%) being resistant
to at least eight of 11 antibiotics. A high degree of resis-
tance to kanamycin, cephalexin, enroﬂoxacin, amikacin,
ampicillin and tetracycline was observed. Such a high
degree of antibiotic resistance of STEC strains has been
reported by many researchers. Donaldson et al. (2006)
reported a similar degree of resistance in E. coli isolates

Werckenthin et al. (2002) also reported resistance rates of
70–90% in E. coli
isolates from healthy and diarrhoeic
calves for ampicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, chloram-
phenicol, kanamycin and neomycin. The multiple drug
resistance pattern most often found in this study was
resistance to kanamycin–cephalexin–cephaloridine–enro-
ﬂoxacin–amikacin–ampicillin–tetracycline.
The multidrug resistance of E. coli

isolates against
cephalosporins and ﬂuoroquinolones is a matter of great
concern regarding public health. Studies have shown that
a high level of resistance to enroﬂoxacin as observed in
our study conferred a similar level of resistance to enoxa-
cin (a ﬂuoroquinolone available for human clinical use).
This has been observed by many researchers especially in
Europe (Bywater et al., 2004). Threlfall et al. (1998) have
suggested that the emergence and spread in the UK of
Salmonella typhimurium DT F04 isolates, a Salmonella
prevalent in humans with reduced sensitivity to ciproﬂox-
acin, followed the licensing of enroﬂoxacin for veterinary
use in that country in 1993. Because of this, they have
recommended a restriction of the veterinary use of ﬂuor-
oquinolones. Zhao et al. (2001) reported the presence of
extended spectrum cephalosporin-resistant E. coli and
Salmonella species in retail ground meat, signifying the
the
public health importance of
pathogenic multidrug-resistant
in
the intestinal microﬂora serve as an important reservoir
of mobile resistance genes which can be transferred to
other bacterial species in the intestines, including patho-
gens, such as Salmonella species (Winokur et al., 2001).
This can be an important mechanism for acquiring anti-
biotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria that pose a chal-
lenge for effective antibiotic therapy. The ﬁndings of our
study suggest that STEC-positive E. coli isolates may play
a dynamic role in the ecology of multidrug resistance in
the dairy environment and perhaps pose an important
public health hazard.

Another intriguing issue of using quinolones, such as
ciproﬂoxacin, as well as other antibiotics (trimethoprim-
sulphamethoxazole) in food-producing animals is their
ability to induce the bacterial SOS response with resulting
stx prophage induction and enhanced intraintestinal Shiga
toxin production. The pervasive and indiscriminate use of
these antibiotics in animals may result in the dissemina-
tion of bacteriophage-encoded virulence factors, such as
Shiga toxins in the environment. Zhang et al. (2000) have
demonstrated that stx-encoding phages are able to move
from one strain of E. coli to another in the intestine of
mice and that antibiotic-mediated prophage induction
enhances this process.

inadvertently enhance the dissemination of bacteriophage-
encoded toxins. This could contribute to the emergence
of new pathogens and the spread of stx genes to other
members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, such as Citro-
bacter and Enterobacter species, both of which have been
associated with Shiga toxin related HUS in humans
(Tschape et al., 1995; Paton and Paton, 1996).

Urease production can contribute to the virulence of
several Gram-negative bacteria and enhance their acid
resistance but in general, ureolytic E. coli strains are rarely
found among clinical isolates. In our study, 11 (26.82%)
STEC strains expressed urea hydrolysis. Phenotype vari-
ants of E. coli serotypes O157:H7 producing this enzyme
have been isolated from patients with bloody diarrhoea
and HC (Public Health Laboratory Service, 1991). Ure-
ase-positive STEC strains from cases of calf diarrhoea and
from slaughtered beef cattle have been reported (Tomina-
ga et al., 1989; Conedera et al., 1997). Among the STEC
of
serotype O5:H-, urease production has also been
reported (Hall et al., 1985). Remarkably, Mercado et al.
(2004) also reported urease-producing STEC isolates
(37.5%) from diarrhoeic calves in Argentina. Moreover,
one of the two O157 STEC strains isolated in our study
showed ureolytic activity similar to that reported by
Friedrich et al. (2005) in STEC O157 of bovine origin. It
has been postulated that urease production could offer
protection from transient digestive activity during an oral
route and perhaps would contribute to a higher virulence
in those strains (Heimer et al., 2002). Urease activity
could, therefore, be considered as a putative virulence fac-
tor of

increasing importance when present

In this study, we found that 28 (68.29%) of 41 STEC
strains were rhamnose non-fermentors while 33 (66%) of
49 non-STEC strains were rhamnose non-fermentors.
Murinda et al. (2004) also reported similar ﬁndings of a
higher percentage of STEC O26 (100%) and a lower per-
centage of non-STEC O26 (40%) rhamnose non-fermen-
tor strains. Thus the rhamnose fermentation reaction may
serve as a diagnostic tool for the detection of STEC from
the cases of diarrhoeal illness.

A number of investigators have reported a correlation
between colicinogenicity and pathogenicity (Papavassiliou,
1962; Yadava and Gupta, 1971; Singh et al., 1989). They
reported that
the incidence of colicinogenicity among
bovine strains ranged from 32% to 61% and pathogenic
strains were more frequently colicin producers than were
non-pathogenic strains. In our study, we also found 18
(44%) of 41 STEC strains positive for colicinogeny while
14 (28%) of 49 non-STEC strains were colicinogenic. This
frequency of colicinogeny among STEC strains of diar-
rhoeic calves in our study is very close to that in humans
(41%; Smarda and Obdrza´lek, 2001). So colicinogeny

may be an important factor in the colonization of intesti-
nal tract and may also dynamically regulate the coloniza-
tion pattern of Shiga and non-Shiga toxin producing
E. coli.

We concluded that in Gujarat, the leading milk-pro-
ducing state of India, STEC and non-STEC eaeA-positive
strains are prevalent in calves with diarrhoea and could
be the cause of disease. Atypical biochemical characters
and colicinogeny of STEC strains along with multiple
drug resistance have been found in this study, indicating
that
the development of such genetic combination in
STEC strains may increase the virulence and pathogenic-
ity of host strains. However, molecular characterization of

and non-STEC eaeA-positive strains has been found in

ried out to conﬁrm the distribution of the stx and eaeA
genes. Further studies regarding the epidemiological and
