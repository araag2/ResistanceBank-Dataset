Nontyphoidal Salmonella
Table eggs

Salmonellosis in humans is typically a foodborne bacterial zoonotic disease. In this regard, eggs and egg
products contaminated with nontyphoidal Salmonella represent a serious threat to consumers. Eggs are
one of the most common sources of animal protein for Sri Lankans but minimum attention is paid to
their quality assurance. Except for a few packaged eggs sold under brand names for higher prices, in
general, grading, cleaning or cooling is not practised before sale posing a microbiological health hazard to
the general public. Hence, the objective of this study was to identify the presence of Salmonella in raw
table eggs available at retail outlets in one selected district of Sri Lanka. Eggs were purchased from 100
retail outlets situated in highly populated areas of the district. Samples were tested for the presence of
Salmonella in eggshell washings and egg contents, separately. Isolation and identiÔ¨Åcation of Salmonella
was performed according to standard methods. The isolates were serotyped and their antimicrobial
sensitivity was determined. Salmonella was isolated from the eggs purchased from 15 retail outlets, of
which 12 yielded Salmonella from shell washings and three from egg contents. The serovars identiÔ¨Åed
were S. Mbandaka, S. Braenderup, S. Corvallis, and S. Emek. Except one isolate showing resistance to
nalidixic acid and another to a third generation cephalosporin, other isolates were sensitive for the tested
antimicrobials. According to the results of this study, retail raw table eggs can be considered as an
important source of nontyphoidal Salmonella to egg consumers in Sri Lanka.

1. Introduction

Salmonellosis is an infectious disease of humans and animals
caused by the bacteria Salmonella (OIE, 2010, Chapter 2. 9. 9).
Among more than 2500 Salmonella serovars, nontyphoidal salmo-
nellae are important foodborne zoonotic pathogens (Hohmann,
2001). Salmonella colonizes in the gastrointestinal tracts of a
broad range of animal species. This bacterium can be either host
adapted or non-host adapted. The infectious disease in poultry is
caused by non motile, typhoidal Salmonella serovars: Salmonella
enterica serovar Pullorum (S. Pollorum) and S. enterica serovar
Gallinarum (S. Gallinarum). These serovars are highly adapted to
the host with little importance in public health (Shivaprasad,
2000). However, non-host adapted serovars can colonize in many

hosts including poultry, cattle and swine, and food derived from
these species can be contaminated with the Salmonella in any level
of farm to fork food supply chain (Forshell & Wierup, 2006).

Comparing to other animal originated food commodities, raw
table eggs and egg products are common vehicles for foodborne
Salmonellosis in humans (Threlfall et al., 2014). Eggs can be
contaminated by Salmonella either through vertical transmission in
which organism can enter into newly formulating eggs while eggs
are being passed through the reproductive tract of the infected
birds or by horizontal transmission where faeces, utensils, pests or
handlers contaminate surfaces of eggs after the egg is laid (Gast,
Guraya, Jones, & Anderson, 2014; Shivaprasad, 2000; Utrarachkij
et al., 2012). Although S. enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis)
and Salmonella eneterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium)
are common causes for poultry associated foodborne illnesses in
human (Galanis et al., 2006; Hendriksen et al. 2011) outbreaks due
to other nontyphoidal serovars such as S. Mbandaka have also been

reported (B‚Ç¨aumler, Hargis, & Tsolis, 2000; Paine et al., 2014; Scheil,
Cameron, Dalton, Murray, & Wilson, 1998). Similarly, recent review
by Threlfall and co-workers, using information from published
literature and epidemiological databases, has clearly mentioned the
importance of serovars other than -S. Enteritidis as a cause of egg-
associated Salmonellosis in human (Threlfall et al., 2014).

In Sri Lanka, published evidences on presence of Salmonella in
poultry production chain are very limited. According to a study
conducted in our laboratory in the year 2008, by testing 128 broiler
meat samples representing four provinces of the country, Salmo-
nella contamination was found as 12% (unpublished data).
In
addition, Liyanagunawardena, et al., 2012 reported that S. Pullorum
and S. Gallinarum, are the commonly associated Salmonella sero-
vars in poultry breeder farms in the country. Although many
research has been conducted to understand Salmonella-contami-
nated eggs as a source of foodborne Salmonellosis in developed
countries, such studies are scarce in Asian countries like Sri Lanka.
Nevertheless, eggs are one of the most common sources of animal
proteins for Sri Lankans. Current per capita consumption of eggs in
the country is 108 (DAPH, 2014). In Sri Lanka, table eggs are
commonly available throughout the country. A few brands of
cleaned and pre-packaged eggs are available for higher prices in
large supermarkets and also in some retail outlets in main cities.
Loose eggs without packaging, stored in wooden crates, often with
some packing materials such as hay or paddy husk, is the most
common form available in retail outlets. Generally, those eggs are
not graded or cleaned before sale and often visible dirt can be seen
on the shells of eggs.

Dirty eggs can contaminate the food chain at many stages not
only while preparing egg products but also due to cross contami-
nation with other food during storage in the refrigerator and pro-
cessing in the kitchen which pose the highest risk to humans. There
can be contamination of hands and surfaces with Salmonella and
other food borne pathogens during food preparation (Carrasco,
Morales-Rueda, & Garc√≠a-Gimeno, 2012; Gorman, BloomÔ¨Åeld, &
Adley, 2002; Soares et al., 2012). With the recent trend in fast food
systems in the country where food is subjected to less heat and/or
prepared in small road side boutiques, the risk due to cross
contamination can be signiÔ¨Åcant. Identifying this risk is highly
necessary when public health is concerned. In the absence of
supporting evidences, such as prevalence of nontyphoidal Salmo-
nella in poultry layer farms or epidemiological data on human
Salmonellosis outbreaks due to consumption of eggs in Sri Lanka,
this study was aimed at isolating, identifying and antimicrobial
resistance proÔ¨Åling of Salmonella serovars present in retail table
eggs.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sampling

Based on the current practices in egg production chain and
observations made in the retail outlets in the said district, we
hypothesised that considerable number of consumers may expose
to potentially pathogenic Salmonella through raw table eggs.
Therefore,
it was decided to test table eggs available at 100
randomly selected retail shops for the presence of Salmonella.

Kandy district consists of 20 administrative regions called
divisional secretariat divisions (DSD) (http://www.kandy.dist.gov.
lk). In order to select 100 shops, DSDs were listed considering the
human population, from the highest to the lowest, and the top 10
DSDs were selected. Convenience sampling was carried out and
randomly selected 10 retail outlets from each DSD, often situated
close to centre of the main towns, were sampled. Fresh eggs either
in pre-packaged form or loose, were purchased as a normal

customer without giving any special instructions to retailer. One
pack of pre-packaged, containing 10 eggs or 10 loose eggs per shop
were purchased, transported to the laboratory within 2 h of
collection. Five randomly selected eggs, out of the 10 purchased,
were pooled to make one sample for testing. The study was carried
out within a period of one year.

2.2.

Isolation of Salmonella

Egg shell washings and egg contents were tested separately. Egg
shell washings were obtained by immersing Ô¨Åve eggs in 225 ml of
sterile buffered peptone water (BPW) (Oxoid, UK). The eggs were
kept in BPW for 30 min and rubbed gently through the bag inter-
mittently. Washed eggs were taken out and disinfected using 70%
ethanol, broken with a sterile knife and internal contents were
collected into a sterile stomacher bag. After mixing the contents
thoroughly, 25 ml of egg content was added to 225 ml of BPW.

For isolation of Salmonella spp., the standard method described
by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO-6579)
was used. BrieÔ¨Çy, the egg shell washings and internal contents, in
separate containers of BPW, were incubated at 37 C for 24 h. After
incubation, samples were selectively enriched in Rappaport Vassi-
liadis broth at 42 C for 24 h. Cultures were then streaked onto
brilliant green agar (Oxoid, UK) and xylose lysine deoxycholate agar
(Oxoid, UK) and incubated at 37 C for 24 h. The suspected colonies
were cultured on nutrient agar and subjected to biochemical tests
which included reactions on triple sugar iron agar, citrate, urease,
and indole tests. The conÔ¨Årmed isolates as described in Clinical
Veterinary Microbiology by (Quinn, Carter, Markey, & Carter, 1994),
were sent to an overseas laboratory for serotyping and antimicro-
bial susceptibility testing.

2.3. Serotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility testing

All the Salmonella isolates were serotyped at the WHO (World
Health Organization) National Salmonella and Shigella Center,
Bangkok, Thailand by slide agglutination. O and H antigens were
characterized by agglutination with hyper immune sera (S & A
Reagents Laboratory, Ltd., Bangkok, Thailand) and serotypes were
assigned based on the Kauffmann-White scheme (Grimont & Weill,
2007).

Antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the isolates were identiÔ¨Åed
by determining minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), at the
DTU-Food, Denmark using a commercially prepared, dehydrated
panel (Sensititre; TREK Diagnostic Systems Ltd., East Grinstead,
England). Since the Salmonella isolates were non-clinical samples,
epidemiological cut off values were applied according to EUCAST
recommendations (www.eucast.org) to determine resistance pro-
Ô¨Åles. The following 12 antimicrobials and cut-off values (mg/L) to
determine resistance (R) were used: ampicillin (R  8), cefotaxime
(R  0.5), chloramphenicol (R  16), ciproÔ¨Çoxacin (R  0.064),
colistin (R  2), gentamicin (R  2), meropenem (R  0.125), nali-
dixic acid (R  16), ceftazidime (R  2), tetracycline(R  8), tige-
cycline (R  1), and trimethoprim (R  2).

3. Results

The eggs purchased from 100 different retail outlets (10 eggs
from each outlet), which included six pre-packaged eggs belonging
to different brands and loose eggs, were tested for Salmonella, both
in egg shell washings and egg contents. Of the 200 analyses carried
out 15 became positive for Salmonella. Out of 15 samples, 12 yielded
Salmonella from shell washings and three from egg contents. None
of the samples were Salmonella positive in both the shell washing
and the contents. Accordingly, overall prevalence was 15% (Table 1).

It was noted that, none of the pre-packaged eggs (n ¬º 6) was
contaminated with Salmonella.

All isolates were distributed among four serotypes, namely
Salmonella Mbandaka (46%), Salmonella Braenderup (26%), Salmo-
nella Corvallis (20%), and Salmonella Emek (7%). S. Mbandaka, the
most commonly found serotype was also the only serotype isolated
from egg contents.

As shown in Table 1, MIC determination of the 15 isolates
revealed a low level of resistance to the antimicrobials tested.
However, two isolates were resistant to either nalidixic acid or
ceftazidime.

4. Discussion

This study indicated a noteworthy level of Salmonella contami-
nation which was 15% in retail raw table eggs in the studied district
of Sri Lanka. Even though this is a novel Ô¨Ånding to the country,
contamination of raw table eggs with Salmonella has been exten-
sively reported elsewhere in the world. In the UK, the reported level
of contamination was 0.38% according to a survey carried out in
food service premises from 2005 to 2006 (Little et al., 2008). India
has reported 7.7% contamination by individually testing 492 eggs
collected from retail shops in a residential area (Suresh, Hatha,
Sreenivasan, Sangeetha, & Lashmanaperumalsamy, 2006). Exam-
ining 100 sales outlets, the contamination level with nontyphoidal
Salmonella identiÔ¨Åed in the present investigation was as high as
15%, emphasizing a signiÔ¨Åcant public health hazard that can be due
to handling or consuming of those eggs.

In the present study, the level of eggshell contamination
exceeded the level of contamination found in egg contents. This
implicates a higher risk to public because dirty eggs can contami-
nate the food chain at many stages as a result of cross
contamination.

The excessive surface contamination could well be due to poor
hygienic standards currently practised from farms to retail shops
during egg production, storage, transportation, and retailing.
Cleaning of eggshells and cooling of eggs, before sale, are not
generally practised by the average retailers. Additionally, other
than plastic crates, wooden crates packed with dry hay, wood
shavings, shredded paper, or paddy husks are often used to

transport eggs from farm to retail and to store at retail. These
packing materials are not cleaned and prepared speciÔ¨Åcally for
transport of eggs. As observed by (Jayasena, Cyril, & Jo, 2012) out of
482 eggs collected from Colombo wholesale egg market, only
60.37% were in the desirable quality based on the speciÔ¨Åcations
recommended by the Sri Lankan Standard Institute (SLS/959:1992)
for chicken eggs. However, the local standards do not specify
microbiological quality requirements for chicken eggs indicating
the poor attention paid for this important parameter. As described
by previous studies, maintaining of microbiological quality in eggs
is important. For instance, mesophilic aerobic bacteria can survive
on eggshells regardless of storage conditions up to 21 days. Further,
the survival rate of S. enterica on egg shells can be increased with
the presence of chicken faeces (Park et al., 2015). In order to reduce
the risk of microbiological hazards, cooling of eggs has been rec-
ommended (Gross et al., 2015; Olivier et al., 2009). Such data is not
available in Sri Lanka and refrigeration is not a mandatory
requirement. Therefore, it is possible that the uncontrolled mar-
keting system existing in the country contributes to the risk of
eggshell contamination with microorganisms including Salmonella.
Additionally, microbial contamination of eggs could be due to
infected birds at the farm level. S. Pullorum and S. Gallinarum are
known to be common causes of poultry diseases leading to eco-
nomic losses- in the country (Priyantha, 2009; Priyantha, Vipulasiri,
& Gunawardana, 2012). In Sri Lanka, except few farms where cage
system of layer management is practised, the most common
method of rearing layers is deep litter open house system. In this
system, with less bio-security, birds are in contact with the natural
environment resulting higher risk for Salmonella contamination.
According to studies done elsewhere, eggs produced by layers can
be contaminated with Salmonella regardless of the management
system at varying degrees (Parisi, Northcutt, Smith, Steinberg, &
Dawson, 2015).Currently, there is no published evidence on prev-
alence of nontyphoidal Salmonella in layer Ô¨Çocks in Sri Lanka but
this information is needed to rule out the contribution of live
poultry to egg contamination.

Serotyping results of the present study revealed the absence of
S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium in raw table eggs in Kandy dis-
trict, though these serovars has been reported by other local
studies. The study done by Weerasooriya et al. found that S.

Typhimurium in a poultry processing plant in Kandy district
(Weerasooriya, Kalupahana, & Abeynayake, 2008) while a study by
Wijemanne reported S. Enteritidis in a poultry breeder farm
(Wijemanna, 2008). The absence of S. Pullorum and S. Gallinarum,
the commonly reported poultry speciÔ¨Åc serovars in the country,
was another signiÔ¨Åcant Ô¨Ånding of this study. Absence of those
serovars may possibly be due to the strict Salmonella control pro-
gramme implemented in breeder farms and recently introduced
vaccination programmes for commercial layer Ô¨Çocks. Under this
vaccination programme, breeder farms and commercial layer farms
are allowed to use SG 9R live vaccine and Salmonella killed vaccine,
respectively. The killed vaccine containing S. Enteritidis and S.
Typhimurium and live vaccine with S. Gallinarum has been shown
to exert cross protection (Van Immerseel et al., 2005).

However, the alarming Ô¨Ånding was that all the serovars isolated
in this study were motile and recorded human pathogens. The
predominant serovar identiÔ¨Åed was S. Mbandaka, which has been
responsible for human disease outbreaks (Paine et al., 2014; Scheil
et al., 1998).There are many reports where S. Mbandaka has been
isolated as contaminants in table eggs (Martelli & Davies, 2012). In
this study, S. Mbandaka was isolated from eggshell washings as
well as from the content. It was the only serovar isolated from egg
content but the shell washings of same samples did not yield S.
Mabandaka or any other Salmonella suggesting the possibility of
contamination during the formation of eggs due to infection in
layers. This notion cannot be conÔ¨Årmed as there is no published
evidence on the occurrence of S. Mbandaka in poultry in Sri Lanka.
However, Hayward et al. from the United Kingdom have reported
possible association of S. Mbandaka with chicken (Hayward, Jansen,
& Woodward, 2013).

Other serovars isolated in this study, S. Braenderup, S. Corvallis,
and S. Emek have also been linked to human disease in other parts
of the world (Gupta et al., 2007; Nakao et al., 2015). One published
study in Sri Lanka on four human clinical cases due to nontyphoidal
Salmonella causing bacteraemia has identiÔ¨Åed S. Enteritidis and S.
Corvallis as the causative agents. In that study all cases had been
treated successfully with third generation cephalosporins indi-
cating the importance of antimicrobials in life saving situations
(Mubarak & Chandrasiri, 2013). In this context, it is disturbing to
note that two Salmonella isolates identiÔ¨Åed in the present study
were resistant against important antimicrobials including a third
generation cephalosporin. Additionally, the emergence of Salmo-
nella species that are resistant to third generation cephalosporins is
already a concern elsewhere (Acheson & Hohmann, 2001; Fey et al.,
2000).

In Sri Lanka, since there is no active surveillance system to
monitor foodborne infections and associated antimicrobial resis-
tance, the full burden of illness due to Salmonellosis and source
attribution of human Salmonellosis is presently unknown. How-
ever, with 15% of retail outlets having table eggs contaminated with
human pathogenic nontyphoidal Salmonella is a serious concern.
Some isolates showing resistance to important antibiotics further
aggravate the problem. Hence, there is a necessity to take measures
to prevent Salmonella contamination of table eggs. In order to
facilitate implementation of proper control measures, identiÔ¨Åcation
of the sources of Salmonella in retail table eggs by furthering studies
is a timely effort. Until such time to minimize public health hazards,
consumers should be educated about risks associated with
improper handling and consumption of table eggs. The data
generated in this study can be utilized to increase vigilance of
consumers, poultry producers, public health policy makers, and
other stakeholders.

5. Conclusions

Out of the 100 retail outlets, 15 had table eggs contaminated
with nontyphoidal Salmonella serovars indicating a potential health
risk to public. Contamination of eggshell washings was three times
higher than that of the egg contents. The serovars identiÔ¨Åed were S.
Mbandaka, S. Braenderup, S. Corvallis and S. Emek. Occurrence of
these serovars raises concern because of their association with re-
ported human illnesses. Except two isolates, one resistant to nali-
dixic acid and the other to ceftazidime others were sensitive to all
the antimicrobials tested. Assurance of microbiological safety of
table eggs through implementation of food safety regulations is
necessary to ensure consumer safety.
