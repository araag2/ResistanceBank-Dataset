1. Introduction

CTX-M-type extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae have been increasingly iden-
tiﬁed in humans and animals, and their potential transmission by contaminated food has been highlighted. In this
study, we report for the ﬁrst time the isolation of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli, Klebsiella
pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis strains harboring blaCTXM-2 or blaCTXM-8 gene variants in chicken meat sold in
markets in southeast Brazil. In this regard, the genetic environment of the blaCTX-M-2 gene is composed of a com-
plex class 1 integron and an ISCR1-associated sequence with dfr and/or aadA gene cassettes located within the
variable region. In summary, chicken meat may be a reservoir of MDR Enterobacteriaceae harboring blaCTX-M-
type genes, which is a public health concern.

Healthcare-associated and community-acquired infections caused
by extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing bacteria have
been increasingly reported worldwide (Pitout and Laupland, 2008).
Although the predominant ESBL families have been TEM, SHV and
CTX-M (Bush and Jacoby, 2010), in the last years, the incidence of the
CTX-M-type has risen dramatically (Wellington et al., 2013). In fact,
currently the CTX-M-2, CTX-M-8 and CTX-M-15 variants are widely dis-
seminated all over the world within Enterobacteriaceae from humans
and animals, and their potential transmission by contaminated food,
mainly chicken meat, has been highlighted (Egervärn et al., 2014;
Kawamura et al., 2014; Kiiru et al., 2012). These enzymes are encoded
by blaCTX-M-type gene associated with mobile genetic elements, includ-
ing insertion sequences ISEcp1 type and ISCR1, most carried on transfer-
able plasmids (Zhao and Hu, 2013). In Brazil, although the production of

the CTX-M enzymes has become the most prevalent mechanism of ac-
quired resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins in gram-negative
bacteria from clinical samples, poultry, food-producing animals, hospi-
tal wastewater and urban rivers (Aizawa et al., 2014; Carvalho-Assef
et al., 2014; Ferreira et al., 2014; Peirano et al., 2011; Silva et al., 2013;
Tollentino et al., 2011), there are no data available regarding the detec-
tion of CTX-M-producing bacteria in chicken meat intended for sale on
the Brazilian market, which is curious, since the presence of CTX-M-2-
and CTX-M-8-producing E. coli in raw chicken and broiler meat
imported into European countries from South America countries, in-
cluding Brazil, has been previously reported (Dhanji et al., 2010;
Egervärn et al., 2014; Warren et al., 2008). So, the aim of this study
was to investigate the presence of ESBL-producing bacteria and the ge-
netic background of genes encoding ESBLs in retail chicken meat from
markets, in southeastern Brazil.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sampling

We investigated the presence of ESBL-producing bacteria in four
pork, three beef, and eight chicken meat samples, collected between
March 2011 and July 2013 from seven traditional marketplaces in the

state of São Paulo, south-eastern Brazil. The samples were immediately
transported to the laboratory for microbiological analysis. For bacterial
isolation, sub samples of 200 g were dispensed on sterile plastic bags
(Whirl-Pak, Nasco, WI, USA) containing 200 mL of Tetrathionate broth
plus 5% of Brilliant-Green broth, and incubated at 37 °C to 24 h. After,
1 mL of this diluent was submitted to serial dilution on Lactose broth
and inoculated on MacConkey agar (Oxoid, Hampshire, England) and
incubated at 37 °C for 24 h.

2.2. Bacterial identiﬁcation and antibiotic susceptibility testing

Bacterial identiﬁcation and initial susceptibility testing and detec-
tion of ESBL producers were performed using the Vitek 2 system
(bioMérieux, France). Identiﬁcation of ESBL producers was based on
the comparison of MIC values for ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and cefepime
tested alone and in association with clavulanic acid, according to CLSI
recommendation (CLSI, 2011). Additionally, antimicrobial susceptibility
proﬁles were determined by the disc diffusion method using commer-
cially available discs (Oxoid, UK). Interpretation was performed accord-
ing to criteria of the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI,
2008, 2011) or following EUCAST guidelines (EUCAST, 2011).
Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was used as reference strain.

2.3. Identiﬁcation of ESBL genes and PCR mapping of class 1 integron

ESBL genes were screened by PCR as previously described
(Tollentino et al., 2011). Sequencing was performed using the BigDye
Terminator v3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with the ABI
PRISM 3130 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). The sequences were annotated in DS Gene 2.0 software and com-
pared with GenBank.

The architecture of the class 1 integron was assessed using the fol-
lowing primers: intI1 gene, I5 (5′-ACCGCCAACTTTCAGCACAT-3′) and
I3 (5′-GCGTTCGGTCAAGGTTCTGG-3′); gene cassettes region, 5′-CS
(5′-GGCATCCAAGCAGCAAGC-3′) and 3′-CS (5′-AAGCAGACTTGACCTG
AT-3′); orf513, ORFend (5′-CCGTTAAGCTCTTATGTGGG-3′); blaCTX-M-2,
blaI (5′-TTAATGATGACTCAGAGCATT-3′) and blaII (5′-GATACCTCGCTC
CATTTATTGC-3′); sul1 + ISCR1, F12F (5′-GTATTGCGCCGCTCTTAGAC-
3′) and F12R (5′-AAACCAGCATGGTTGGCTAC-3′); and 3′-CS (qacEΔ1),
qacEΔ1B (5′-CAAGCTTTTGCCCATGAAGC-3′) (Power et al., 2005).

3. Results

During the study, six broad-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant En-
terobacteriaceae strains were recovered from four different retail chick-
en meat samples, purchased from distinct markets (Table 1). These
antibiotic-resistant isolates identiﬁed as Proteus mirabilis (n = 1),
Citrobacter diversus (n = 1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1) and

Escherichia coli (n = 3) exhibited additional resistance to human and
veterinary quinolones, aminoglycosides and/or
trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole and were positive for the production of ESBL. In fact,
PCR screening for blaESBL genes showed that the six strains carried
CTX-M-encoding genes. According to sequencing results, while most
strains harbored the blaCTX-M-2 gene, the presence of the blaCTX-M-8
was only conﬁrmed in one E. coli strain from market D (Table 1). On
the other hand, the analysis of the genetic environment revealed that
blaCTX-M-2 genes in P. mirabilis S11, K. pneumoniae S105, and E. coli
S137 and Lac60 strains comprised a complex class 1 integron and an
ISCR1-associated sequence, with dfr and/or aadA gene cassettes located
within the variable region of the class 1 integron (Fig. 1). Curiously, for
C. freundii Ec32 and E. coli CF1 strains the genetic environment of the
blaCTX-M-2 and blaCTX-M-8 gene variants could not be determined by the
methodology used herein, since the presence of class 1 integron was
not observed in either of them.

4. Discussion

In this study, we report the occurrence of MDR Enterobacteriaceae in
chicken meat intended for sale in the Brazilian market. Resistance to
broad-spectrum cephalosporins was associated with CTX-M-2 and
CTX-M-8 enzymes, which is a cause of clinical concern. In order to de-
termine the genetic background of blaCTX-M genes, different PCRs were
conducted, using several primer combinations (Power et al., 2005).
The results showed that blaCTX-M-2 was part of a structure similar to
the complex class 1 integrons InS21 and In116, except for the variable
region (Di Conza et al., 2002; Power et al., 2005). This kind of structure
has been very common in South America (Andrade et al., 2010; Power
et al., 2005; Quiroga et al., 2013), whereas, it has been also found spo-
radically in Spain (Valverde et al., 2006). Additionally, in a recent
study in Belgium, similar class 1 integron structures were identiﬁed in
Salmonella enterica isolated from poultry (Doublet et al., 2014). Thus,
this study report for the ﬁrst time the presence of blaCTX-M-2 genes
harbored by complex class 1 integrons in Enterobacteriaceae strains re-
covered from retail chicken meat in Brazil. With regard to P. mirabilis
strain S11, the genetic environment of blaCTX-M-2 is composed of a com-
plex class 1 integron and an ISCR1-associated sequence, with dfrA1 and
aadA1 gene cassettes located within the variable region, which confer
resistance to trimethoprim and streptomycin, respectively. This ar-
rangement of gene cassettes was found in E. coli and Salmonella isolated
from poultry in Korea and in Belgium (Dessie et al., 2013; Doublet et al.,
2014) and from clinical isolates from animals in Ireland (Karczmarczyk
et al., 2011). K. pneumoniae S105 presented only the dfrA1 gene in the
variable region, which has not been previously reported; and while
E. coli S137 presented the dfrA7 gene, a variant of dfrA1 previously
found in a E. coli from an unhealthy animal in Ireland (Karczmarczyk
et al., 2011), E. coli Lac60 carried only the aadA1 gene in the variable

region, such as In2::ISCR1::blaCTX-M-2 integron previously reported in
Argentina (Quiroga et al., 2013).

In summary, to the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst Brazilian
study showing retail chicken meat as an important vehicle for the
dissemination of ESBL-producing enterobacteria, which is a major
commercial and public health issue, since Brazil is the third largest
producer of chicken meat and the largest exporter of this product,
with a high domestic consumption (Alves et al., 2012). So, surveillance
of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from food-producing animals
and derived food products needs to be established as a priority.
Moreover, strategies for the rational use of antimicrobial agents in
food animals need to be taken urgently, in order to inhibit the release
of MDR bacteria harboring blaCTX-M-type genes in food.
