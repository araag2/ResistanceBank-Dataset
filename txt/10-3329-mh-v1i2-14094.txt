The present research work was carried out for the isolation and identification of bacterial flora from internal organs of broiler during the 
period from January 2012 to June 2012. Ten Hubbard classic broiler bird were purchased from retail market in Mymensingh, Bangladesh. 
The birds were sacrificed  and their liver, lung,  esophagus, duodenum  and tracheal swab samples were  collected (n=50). Using standard 
bacteriological techniques, Escherichia coli was isolated from 26 (52%) samples. Similarly, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus spp., Bacillus 
spp., and Pasteurella spp. were isolated from 15 (30%), 10 (20%), 9 (18%) and 4 (8%) samples, respectively. On the basis of individual 
sample type, E. coli could be isolated from 8 (80%) duodenum samples being the most prevalent organism. On the other hand, Salmonella 
spp., Staphylococci spp., Bacillus spp. and Pasteurella spp. were identified in 5 (50%) lungs, 5 (50%) liver, 4 (40%) duodenum and 2 (20%) 
lungs samples, respectively. Among these isolated bacteria, E. coli was found to be pathogenic for mice. Antibiogram studies revealed that 
Ciprofloxacin was highly sensitive against all the isolated bacteria. Diversified bacterial species are prevalent in broiler. However, E. coli 
and Salmonella spp. infection might make the bird vulnerable for easy access of infection. Proper vaccination and use of selective antibiotics 
are crucial in protecting broilers from these pathogens.

Introduction 
 
Bangladesh  is  an  agriculture  based  country.    As  such  poultry 
rearing is considered superior to the others in agricultural sector 
because of an almost assured in a relatively short period of time. 
Commercial  poultry  industry  (mostly  broilers  and  layers)  plays 
an  important  role  in  the  economy  of  Bangladesh.  But  the 
advancement  of  poultry  industry  is  being  hampered  by  various 
pathogenic  bacterial  infections  causing  nearly  30%  mortality  of 
chickens that has been  estimated to cost about Tk. 8,000 crores 
annually  in  Bangladesh.  The  bacterial  count  in  poultry  housing 
systems  is  particularly  high  in  comparison  to  those  of  pig  and 
cattle.  These pathogens get access to poultry flocks from various 
sources.  Little  is  known  about  the  bacterial  presence  in  the 
poultry  environment  such  as  in  poultry  litter  and  in  the  poultry 
house  air  (Saleh  et  al.,  2003).  Intestinal  bacteria  play  an 
important role on health through their effects on gut morphology, 
nutrition,  pathogenesis  of 
immune 
responses  (Mead,  2000).  Various  pathogenic  microbes,  such  as 
Escherichia  coli,  Salmonella  spp.,  Bacillus  spp.,  Streptococcus 
spp. and Staphylococcus spp., have been implicated to reduce the 
growth of poultry (Duke, 1986). Broiler is a major fast growing 
source of meat in the world today. The modern poultry industry 
can produce market-ready broiler chickens in less than six weeks. 
This  accomplishment  has  been  achieved 
through  genetic 
selection, 
improved  feeding  and  keen  health  management 
practices including usage of antibiotics as therapeutic agents to

treat  bacterial  diseases  in  intensive  farming  systems  (Apata, 
2009).  Resistance  against  frequently  used  antibiotics  has  been 
observed in bacteria present in poultry since the introduction of 
these  antimicrobial  agents  in  poultry.  The  rise  in  antibiotic 
resistance  has  been  reported  in  the  past  two  decade  in  many 
countries including Bangladesh (Kapil, 2004). In Bangladesh, the 
economic  aspect  of  poultry  disease  and  their  mortality  and 
morbidity due to bacterial infection is a matter of great concern to 
the  livestock  owners.  The  antibiotic  resistance  pattern  increases 
the  incidence of  disease  in  poultry  and  subsequently  affects  the 
economy  of  Bangladesh.  Therefore,  this  study  was  designed  to 
isolate  and  identify  the  associated  bacteria  prevalent  in  internal 
organs  of  broiler  birds  and  to  find  out  the  effective  antibiotics 
against the bacteria through antibiogram studies. 
 
Materials and Methods 
 
Collection of Samples 
The research work was conducted during the period from January 
2012  to  June  2012.  Ten  Hubbard  classic  broiler  birds  were 
collected  from  retail  marker  in  Mymensingh,  Bangladesh.  The 
birds  were  sacrificed  and  the  liver,  lung,  esophagus,  duodenum 
and  tracheal  swabs  were  collected  aseptically.  The  collected 
samples  were  brought  to  the  Bacteriology  Laboratory  of  the 
Department  of  Microbiology  and  Hygiene  under  Faculty  of 
Veterinary  Science,  Bangladesh  Agricultural  University  (BAU) 
for microbiological analysis. 
 
Isolation of associated bacteria 
Primary  culture  was  performed  in  Nutrient  agar  and  Nutrient 
broth  media.  For  sub-culturing,  suspected  bacteria  were 
inoculated  separately  onto  different  bacteriological  agar  media

to  study 

under aseptic condition and incubated at 370C for 24 hours. Pure 
cultures  were  achieved  as  per  procedures  described  by  OIE 
(2000), Merchant and Packer (1967) and Cowan (1985). 
 
Identification of associated bacteria 
Cultural,  morphological  and  biochemical  characteristics  were 
studied  in  order  to  identify  the  bacterial  flora.  The  cultural 
characteristics or colonial  morphology of the bacteria grown on 
the nutrient and blood agar media were recorded. Gram staining 
was  performed 
the  morphology  and  staining 
characteristics of bacteria according to the technique described by 
Merchant  and  Packer  (1967).  Biochemical  tests,  such  as  sugar 
fermentation, coagulase, catalase, MR, VP, and indole tests, were 
performed per standard methods (Cheesbrough, 1985). 
 
Antibiotic sensitivity test 
A previously described disc diffusion process, known as Kirby-
Bauer method  
 
(Bauer et al., 1966; Jakaria et al. 2012) was used to determine the 
susceptibility  of  the  bacterial  isolates  against  selected  antibiotic 
Table 1: Bacterial flora isolated from internal organs (n=50) of broiler 
 
Isolated bacteria 

agents.  For  this  purpose,  eight  different  antibiotic  discs  were 
obtained  from  commercial  sources  (Oxoid  Ltd,  Baring-stoke, 
Hampshire,  England).  The  selected  antibiotics  used  were 
Ciprofloxacin  (5  µg/disc),  Cloxacillin  (5  µg/disc),  Amoxicillin 
(10  µg/disc),  Chloramphenicol  (30  µg/disc),  Neomycin  (30 
µg/disc), Erythromycin (5 µg/disc), Ampicillin (30 µg/disc) and 
Colistin sulphate (25 µg/disc). The interpretation on susceptibility 
was done according to the guidelines of Clinical and Laboratory 
Standard Institute (CLSI, 2007; formerly known as NCCLS).

Prevalence  of  bacterial  flora  in  different  internal  organs  of 
broiler 
From the collected samples (n=50), E. coli was isolated from 26 
(52%)  cases,  whereas  Salmonella  spp.  was  found  in  15  cases 
(30%). Similarly, the overall prevalence of Staphylococcus spp., 
Bacillus  spp.  and  Pasteurella  spp.  found  in  10  (20%),  9  (18%) 
and 4 (8%) samples, respectively. The results have been shown  
in Fig 1. It is notable that all five different types of bacteria could 
be  isolated  from  liver.  Tracheal  swab  revealed  the  presence  of 
only two types of bacteria. No Staphylococcus spp. and Bacillus 
spp.  could  be  isolated  from  duodenum  and  lung  samples, 
respectively.  No  Bacillus  or  Pasteurella  spp.  could  be  isolated 
from esophagus samples. E. coli was the most prevalent bacteria 
in all types of samples in this study (Table 1).  
 
On the basis of individual sample type, the highest prevalence of 
E.  coli  (80%)  was  recorded  in  duodenum.  Similarly,  highest 
prevalence  of  Salmonella  spp.  (50%)  and  Staphylococcus  spp. 
(50%) were found in the lung and liver. On the other hand, the 
highest  prevalence  of  Bacillus  spp.  (40%)  and  Pasteurella  spp. 
(20%)  were  recorded  in  duodenum  and  lung,  respectively.  The 
results have been illustrated in Fig 2.

Antibiogram studies 
Based  on  the  susceptibility  to  antibiotics,  the  bacteria  were 
categorized  into  three  groups  viz.  sensitive,  intermediate  and 
resistance. Out of eight antibiotics used this study, Ciprofloxacin 
and  Neomycin  were  found  to  be  sensitive  against  all  five 
different bacterial isolates. Chloramphenicol was sensitive to four 
isolates,  whereas  Ampicillin  and  Amoxicillin  were  sensitive  to 
three  isolates.  Cloxacillin  and  Erythromycin  were  found  to  be 
sensitive against two bacterial isolates and Colistin sulphate was 
resistant to four isolates. The antibiotic sensitivity patterns have 
been summarized in Fig 3.

(2012)  reported  a  30.55%  prevalence  of  Salmonella  spp.  in 
poultry  meat  which  is  lower  than  that  of  the  present  study.  In 
contrast,  Hentschel  et  al.  (1979)  studied  a  prevalence  of  47% 
Staphylococcus  spp.  in  cloacal  swabs.  This  variation  of  results 
might be due to day by day increasing the load of bacterial flora. 
 
In the present study,  E. coli isolated from broiler were found to 
be sensitive to Ciprofloxin, Chloramphenicol and Neomycin. The 
results  strengthen  the  earlier  observations  of  Jeyasanta  et  al. 
(2012), Akond et al. (2009) and Nazir et al. (2005). The E. coli 
was  resistant  against  Amoxicillin,  Erythromycin,  Ampicillin, 
Cloxacillin and Colistin sulphate. Similar findings were reported 
by  Jeyasanta  et  al.  (2012)  and  Akond  et  al  (2009).  The 
Salmonella  sp.  was  found  to  be  sensitive  to  Ciprofloxacin, 
Amoxicillin,  Chloramphenicol  and  Neomycin.  This  result  was 
supported by Khan et al. (2005) and De-Jong et al. (2012), where 
and 
the

Chloramphenicol.  However,  our 
to 
Chloramphenicol,  Erythromycin,  Cloxacillin  and  Colistin

and  Colistin 
to 
Ciprofloxacillin,  Amoxicillin,  Chloramphenicol,  Ampicillin, 
Neomycin  and  Cloxacillin.  Similar  results  were  described  by 
Shivachandra et al. (2004) and Huang et al. (2009).  Sellyei et al. 
(2009) found Pasteurella spp. to be sensitive to Colistin sulphate. 
A possible cause of this variation could be due to random use of 
antibiotic  resulting  resistance  against  different  antibiotics. 
Among  the  Gram  positive  bacteria,  Staphylococcus  spp.  was 
found to be sensitive to all tested antibiotics. Bacillus spp., was 
sensitive to Cloxacillin and Colistin sulphate, which supports the 
findings of Nasrin et al. (2007) and Guven et al. (2005). 
 
The pathogenicity test for all the isolated  E. coli revealed that all. 
were  pathogenic.although  the  bacteria  were  originated  from 
apparently  healthy  birds.  Landman  and  Cornelissen  (2006) 
reported  that  more  than  one  predisposing  factors  such  as 
environmental and managemental factors (housing, climate etc), 
imbalance nutrition and immune status of the poultry might play 
roles  in  developing  diseases  while  harboring  the  potential 
pathogenic  bacteria..  The  pathogenicity  test  of  Staphylococcus 
spp.  was  performed  by  coagulase  test.  All  of  the  isolates  were 
coagulase  negative  and  therefore,  were  considered  as  non 
pathogenic. Staphylococcus spp. can be either coagulase positive 
or  coagulase  negative  (Adegoke,  1986),  and  Staphylococcus 
aureus  is  commonly  recognized  as  the  only  coagulase  positive 
candidate.  Additional 
further 
characterization of the bacterial isolates described in this study.  
 
Conclusion 
 
Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus spp., Bacillus 
spp.,  and  Pasteurella  spp.  were  isolated  from  internal  organ 
samples  of  broilers  collected  from  a  local  retail  market  in 
Bangladesh.  Prudent  use  of  antibiotics  should  be  considered  in 
broiler  production  (where  permissible)  since  many  strains  are 
resistant  to  common  antibiotics  as  described  in  this  study.  
Potential  drug  resistant  pathogens  in  otherwise  normal  broilers 
may  be  a  serious  concern  for  public  health.    Current  findings 
warrants further studies with the isolated stains of bacteria.

Discussion 
 
In  the  present  study,  five  different  bacteria (E.  coli,  Salmonella 
spp.,  Pasteurella  spp.,  Staphylococcus  spp.  and  Bacillus  spp.) 
were isolated from the internal organs of broiler.  This is in line 
of  findings  by  Malmuthuge  et  al.  (2012)  and  Voidarou  et  al. 
(2011). Considering all the 50 samples, E. coli was isolated from 
26 (52%) samples. This finding is consistent with that of  Awad-
Alla  et  al.  (2010)  and  Aguirre  et  al.  (1992)  who  described  a 
prevalence  of  51%  in  broiler  and  52%  in  black-billed  ducks, 
respectively.  The  prevalence  of  Salmonella  spp.  was  30%  in 
broiler, which is supported by Cardinale et al. (2003), Temelli et 
al.  (2012)  and  Alcaine  et  al.  (2007).  However,  a  significant 
variation regarding prevalence of Salmonella spp. was described 
in  other  findings,  such  as  17.9%  by  Tibaijula  et  al.  (2003), 
14.37%  by  Petrovic  et  al.  (2011)  and  13%  by  Ellerbroek  et  al. 
(2010).  Similarly,  Afroz  et  al.  (2012)  reported  a  26.02% 
prevalence of Salmonella spp. in internal organs of layer. These 
variations might be due to difference in sample size, geographical 
location  and  type  of  bird.  In  this  study,  the  prevalence  of 
Pasteurella spp. was 8%. Similar observation was also recorded 
by Spadafora et al. (2011) and Tatum et al. (2005). Among the 
Gram positive bacteria, overall prevalence of Staphylococcus spp. 
was 20%, which is similar to the findings described by Hanning 
et  al.  (2012)  and  Alfonso  and  Barnes  (2006).  The  overall 
prevalence of Bacillus spp. was 18%, which supports the findings 
of Wu et al. (2011) and Hoq et al. (2005). 
 
E.  coli  was  highly  prevalent  (80%)  in  duodenum,  whereas 
Salmonella  spp.  was  highly  prevalent  in  lungs  (50%).  On  the 
other  hand,  Pasteurella  spp.,  Staphylococcus  spp.,  and  Bacillus 
spp.,  were  found  mostly  in  the  lung  (20%),  liver  (50%)  and 
duodenum  (40%),  respectively.  Nazir  et  al.  (2005)  studied  the 
prevalence of E. coli in broiler feces and found 65% prevalence 
which  is  lower  than  that  of  the  present  study.  Temelli  et  al.
