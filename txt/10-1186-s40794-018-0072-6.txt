Abstract

Background: Salmonella species are among the most common food borne pathogens worldwide and their
infection is one of the major global public health problems. During the last decade, multidrug resistant Salmonella
species have greatly increased in humans and animals. So the aim of this study was to determine prevalence and
antibiotic susceptibility pattern of Salmonella in apparently healthy slaughterer cattle and personnel working at the
Jimma abattoir.
Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May to September 2016 at the Jimma abattoir. A total of 440
samples consisting of carcass swabs (n = 195), cattle feces (n = 195), and human stool (n = 50) were collected. Standard
isolation and identification procedures were performed to identify Salmonella isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests
were also carried out on each isolate.
Results: The overall proportion of Salmonella positive isolates was 9.5% in all samples, of which 11.3% were
from carcass swabs, 5.6% from cattle feces, and 18% from human stool. All isolates were resistant to tasted
antibiotics except Ciprofloxacin.
Conclusion: This study ascertains that Salmonella were widely distributed and significant proportions have
developed resistance to routinely prescribed antibiotics. Therefore, there is needed to implement urgent
intervention programs in study area.

Background
Diseases caused by Salmonella represent an important
public health problem worldwide. It is estimated that
globally 93.8 million cases and 155,000 deaths are
associated with gastroenteritis due to Salmonella species
annually. Evidence indicated that 85.6% were estimated
to be food borne, and infection was associated with
many different
including beef and beef
products [1, 2].

Pathogens are mainly disseminated through the animal
trade and uncooked animal food products [3, 4]. The
process of removing the gastrointestinal tract during
meat processing is regarded as one of the most import-
ant sources of contamination of carcass and organs with
Salmonella at abattoirs, and also the hands of abattoir
employees can be the vector to spread Salmonella
through cross contamination [5–7].

In humans, in addition to concern about foodborne
disease caused by Salmonella species, concern was
raised about
the impact of acquired antimicrobial
resistance transferred among these organisms, which

limits therapeutic options both in veterinary and public
health practice [8, 9]. Multidrug resistant (MDR) isolates
were widely reported in Europe and America from trav-
elers and adopted children [10]. Antimicrobial drug mis-
use, drugs prescription without susceptibility testing,
self-medication, and long hospitalization were suggested
as contribution to MDR in developing nations [11].

In Ethiopia, several factors including unhygienic living
circumstances, tradition of raw meat consumption, and
indiscriminate use of antimicrobials may substantially
contribute to the occurrence of Salmonellosis. Although
surveillance and monitoring systems are not in place
and its epidemiology is not described, qualitative and
quantitative syntheses of previous studies could shed
light on the occurrence of the disease and the major se-
rotypes that frequently cause infections. Therefore, this
study was designed to determine the prevalence and
antimicrobial resistance patterns of Salmonella in appar-
ently healthy slaughtered cattle and personnel working
at Jimma municipal Abattoir.

Apparently healthy cattle ready for
abattoir workers in the Jimma municipal abattoir who
were engaged in slaughtering were selected randomly.
Animals and abattoir personnel with clinical symptoms
of salmonellosis, and also those on antibiotic treat-
ment for at last 2 weeks prior to the study, were the
exclusion criteria.

Sample collection, isolation and identification procedure
Study samples were selected using a simple random
sampling technique, and 195 slaughter cattle were
sampled. Sample collection, isolation, and identification
were made based on the recommendations of
the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO),
6579:2002 [8].

One hundred and nightly five (195) carcass swabs were
collected. Each carcass was sampled on four regions, i.e.,
from neck, brisket, flank, and rump region. The area
sampled in each region was 100 cm2, resulting in a total
area of 400 cm2, using different pre-moistened commer-
cial beef carcass sampling poly wipe kits, and the swabs
were transferred to a sterile plastic cup containing 10 ml
of buffered peptone water. In addition, one (1) gram of
feces from the rectum of the cattle and one (1) gram of
stool sample from abattoir personnel was collected
and transferred into to 9 ml of buffered peptone
water separately.

Homogenized carcass and fecal sample from the cattle
and personnel were incubated at 37 °C. Then, 1 ml and
0.1 ml aliquot of the enrichment broths was transferred
aseptically into 10 ml of Selenite Cystine and 10 ml of
Rappaport–Vassiliadis with soya broth and incubated for
24 h at 37 °C and 42 °C, respectively. Following incuba-
tion, a loop full of each culture was streaked onto
Brilliant Green Agar and Xylose Lysine Deoxycholate
agar plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 to 48 h. The
plates (BGA and XLD) were examined for the presence
of characteristics associated with Salmonella colonies. A
single positive colony showing red color with a black
center on XLD and red color on BGA agars were
subjected for biochemical tests for confirmation.

Biochemical tests
Salmonella isolates were identified using triple sugar
iron agar, lysine iron agar, urea broth, indole test, and
citrate utilization tests. These were incubated for 24 to
48 h at 37 °C. Colonies producing an alkaline slant with

acid bottom and hydrogen sulfide production on TSI,
positive for lysine, negative for urea hydrolysis, negative
for indole test, and positive for citrate utilization were
considered as Salmonella. Finally, susceptibility to anti-
microbial was performed for all isolates.

Antimicrobial susceptibility test
All
isolates were tested by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion
method using guidelines established by the Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [12]. In brief, by
taking pure isolated colonies, bacterial suspension in test
tubes was adjusted and compared to 0.5McFarland
turbidity standards. The diluted bacterial suspension was
then transferred to a Mueller-Hinton agar plate using a
sterile cotton swab and seeded uniformly by rubbing the
swab against the entire agar surface and left on the bench
to absorb or dry. Subsequently the selected antibiotics were
placed 15-20 mm apart from each other using sterile for-
ceps and then incubated at 37 °C for 16 to 18 h. A total of
10 selected antibiotics disks (Oxide, UK) were included:
Ciprofloxacin (CIP) 5 μg, Chloramphinicol (C) 30 μg,
Kanamycin (K) 10 μg, Ampicillin (AMP)10 μg, Gentamicin
(GM), Tetracycline (TE) 30 μg, Sulfamethoxazole Tri-
methoprim (SXT) 23.75/1.25 μg, Streptomycin (S) 10 μ,
Amikacin (AK) 30 μg and Cephalothin (CF) 30 μg. Finally,
the zone of inhibition was measured and interprets as sus-
ceptible, intermediate, or resistant categories assigned on
the basis of the critical points recommended by the CLSI.

Data quality assurance and analysis
All the instruments used for sample processing were
checked prior to the study. Proper functioning has been
checked using quality control strains of Salmonella
typhimurium (ATCC 14028) and E.coli (ATCC 25922).
Data consistency and completeness were made all the
way during data collection, data entry and analysis. Data
were edited, and checked for its completeness and en-
tered into Epi Data 3.1 then exported to Statistical Pack-
ages for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 for analysis.

Antimicrobial resistance profiles of cattle and human
isolates
Resistance to Ampicillin (54.8%), Streptomycin (42.9%),
and Tetracycline (40.5%) were the most common
resistance profiles identified among both human and
cattle isolates. Different numbers of resistance were
observed to Ciprofloxacin in both human and animal
isolates (Table 3).

Seventeen, (40.5%) of both human and cattle isolates
indicated resistance to two or more of the antimicrobials

tested, and 10/42 (23.8%) of human and cattle isolates
were classified as intermediate level resistance (Table 4).

Discussion
In this study, Salmonella were isolated from 11.3% of
samples collected from slaughter cattle carcasses. This
finding reveled that there was a considerable rate of con-
tamination in the Jimma slaughter house, which poten-
tially poses a risk of causing food-associated illness.
These findings support previous studies undertaken in
the current study area, reporting 13.3% as Salmonella
positive [13]. Reports from Addis Ababa indicated isola-
tion of Salmonella from abdominal 9.8% and from
diaphragmatic muscles 11.9% [14]. The prevalence re-
ported in the current study is higher than other reports
such as 0.0% from Egypt [15], in Namibia 0.50% [16],

4.5% in Thailand [17], 6% in Central India [18], 8.5% in
Saudi Arabia [19] 4.8% [9], 7.6% [20] in Baher Dar
Ethiopia. This difference possibly arises from the source
of animals, types of samples, and sampling technique.

The present finding showed Salmonella among indi-
viduals working in the Jimma slaughter house was 9/50
(18%). This prevalence indicates that significant propor-
tions of the study group were carriers of Salmonella with
increased likelihood of transfer of the infection to others
through contamination of food. The current finding was
much higher than studies conducted elsewhere 2.4%
[19], 6.0% [14], 3.4% [21], 0.93% [22] and 0.9% [23]. The
possible factors that favor the transmission and preva-
lence of salmonellosis may include environmental and
personal sanitation, socio-economic and living stan-
dards, availability of water supply, and awareness of safe
food handling and preparation among individuals.

The present study also showed that 40.3% of human
and cattle isolates were resistance to two or more anti-
microbial drugs. This finding is in good harmony with a
study conducted in Asella town on identification and
antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of Salmonella iso-
lated from the selected dairy farms, abattoir animals and
humans, which observed 50% of isolates, were resistant
to two or more antimicrobials [24]. However the present
results were lower than a study conducted in Addis

Ababa where 83% of isolates were resistant to two or more
antimicrobials [25]. Our study showed Ciprofloxacin
(100%), Chloramphenicol (85.7%), Sulphamethoxazole tri-
metoprime
(85.7%), Gentamicin (85.7%), Kanamicin
(78.6%), and Cephalothin (76.2%) have good antimicrobial
activity against both human and cattle Salmonella isolates.
This result is comparable with previous reports from
animal and human isolates in Addis Ababa [25] and Asela,
Ethiopia [24]. However the present findings a contradict a
study conducted at the Jimma University specialized hos-
pital which showed all Salmonella isolates were 100% re-
sistant to chloramphenicol, Gentamycin and Cephalothin
[26]. Another study conducted in Saudi Arabia stetted that
88.6% were resistant to Chloramphenicol [19]. The differ-
ence in Salmonella antimicrobial resistance levels in dif-
ferent areas of the country may be related to agent risk
factors, such as virulence, pathogenicity,
infectiousness,
and host specificity associated with the genetic compos-
ition of Salmonella strains.

Conclusion
The carcasses associated with the Jimma municipal abat-
toirs were highly contaminated with Salmonella and this
may pose a risk to the consumer. Some asymptomatic
cattle presented for slaughter contribute to carcass con-
tamination because of Salmonella in the intestines that
has a high chance of being transferred onto the carcass
and also an 18% carriage rate of Salmonella species
among personnel working at the Jimma municipality ab-
attoir. This can be a possible source of salmonellosis for
the community unless carriers are treated or other pre-
ventive measures are taken. A high rate of antimicrobial

resistance was observed mainly to Ampicillin, Strepto-
mycin, and Tetracycline, and both single and multiple
antimicrobial resistance patterns were observed, which is
of special concern in Ethiopia due to antimicrobial
resistance problems. Regulatory control of antibiotic
usage in livestock and humans, and periodical health
checking of workers in the abattoirs, are recommended
