Abstract The present study was undertaken to de-
termine the occurrence, distribution and antimicrobial
resistance pattern of Salmonella serovars in appar-
ently healthy slaughtered sheep and goats in central
Ethiopia. A total 1224 samples consisting of faeces,
mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and abdomi-
nal and diaphragmatic muscle samples were collected
from 104 sheep and 100 goats. Salmonella was iso-
lated from 12 of 104 (11.5%) sheep and 3 of 100
(3%) goats. Of the total 624 and 600 samples examined
from sheep and goats, 18 (2.9%) and 4 (0.7%), respec-
tively, were Salmonella positive. The 22 Salmonella

Introduction

Previous reports have indicated that sheep and goats
harbour a wide range of Salmonella serovars and act
as one of the sources of infection of human salmonel-
losis (Nabbut and Al-Nakhli, 1982; Abdel-Ghani et al.,
1987). Contamination of red meat by Salmonella may
occur at abattoirs from carrier animals excreting the
organism and by contaminated abattoir equipment
and ﬂoors (Smeltzer et al., 1980). It is obvious that
salmonellae in the mesenteric lymph nodes, which
could be incised during the inspection process, and in
faeces, constitute sources for contamination of red meat
and other edible parts of the carcasses (Smeltzer et al.,
1980; Nabbut and Al-Nakhli, 1982).

Antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella is a global
public health and veterinary concern. The widespread
administration of medically important antimicrobials
to food animals at subtherapeutic or prophylactic
doses may promote on-farm selection of antimicrobial-
resistant strains and markedly increase the human
health risks associated with consumption of contam-
inated meat products (D’Aoust et al., 1992). Fur-
thermore, in most sub-Saharan African countries like
Ethiopia, antimicrobial agents are indiscriminately
used in both veterinary and human health practices and
a high level of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella
has been reported (Leegard et al., 1996; Mache et al.,
1997; Alemayehu et al., 2003).

Studies conducted in Ethiopia indicated the presence
of Salmonella in various food animals (Alemayehu
et al., 2003; Molla et al., 2004) and in humans (Mache
et al., 1997). However, information on salmonellosis
in sheep and goat is very limited (Woldemariam et al.,
2005). This study was therefore undertaken to deter-
mine the occurrence, distribution and antimicrobial re-
sistance pattern of Salmonella serovars isolated from
apparently healthy slaughtered sheep and goats at the
Addis Ababa and Modjo abattoirs, central Ethiopia.

Materials and methods

Collection of samples

A cross-sectional study on Salmonella was undertaken
from September 2003 to February 2004 at the Addis
Ababa abattoir (Addis Ababa) and Modjo abattoir
(Modjo), Ethiopia. Modjo is a small town located 73 km

south-east of Addis Ababa. The sheep and goats slaugh-
tered originated from markets and were brought to the
abattoirs either on foot or by truck. In Addis Ababa
abattoir, an average of 250 sheep, 75 goats and 700
head of cattle are slaughtered daily. In Modjo abat-
toir on average 50 sheep and 500 goats are slaugh-
tered daily. On each sampling day, six types of sam-
ples were collected from 12 randomly selected sheep
and goats (n = 72). Faecal, mesenteric lymph nodes,
liver, spleen, diaphragm and abdominal muscle sam-
ples were collected separately in sterile containers. A
total of 624 and 600 samples were collected from 104
sheep and 100 goats respectively. The samples were
transported to the laboratory for analysis in an icebox
packed with ice.

Isolation and identiﬁcation of Salmonella

Salmonellae were isolated and identiﬁed accord-
ing to the techniques recommended by the Interna-
tional Organization for Standardization (ISO 6579,
1998) and Quinn and colleagues (2004) as de-
scribed previously (Alemayehu et al., 2003; Molla
et al., 2004). Presumptive Salmonella isolates were
shipped to the Public Health Agency, Ofﬁce Interna-
tional des ´Epizooties (OI ´E) Reference Laboratory for
Salmonellosis, Guelph, Ontario, Canada for serotyp-
ing, phage typing and antimicrobial resistance testing.

Serotyping

the somatic (O) antigens of

For serotyping,
the
Salmonella isolates were determined with a slide ag-
glutination test as described by Ewing (1986), whereas
the ﬂagellar (H) antigens were identiﬁed by using a mi-
crotechnique that employs microtitre plates (Shipp and
Rowe, 1980). The antigenic formulae of Salmonella
serovars as listed by Popoff and Le Minor (1997) were
used to name the serovars.

Phage typing

The standard phage typing technique described by
Anderson and Williams (1956) was followed. S.
enteritidis strains were phage typed with typing phages
obtained from the International Centre for Enteric
Phage Typing (ICEPT), Central Public Health Labora-
tory, Colindale, United Kingdom (Ward et al., 1987) via
the National Laboratory for Enteric Pathogens (NLEP),

Health Canada, Winnipeg, Manitoba. The phage typ-
ing scheme and phages for S. typhimurium developed
by Callow (1959) and further extended by Anderson
(1964) and Anderson and colleagues (1977) were ob-
tained from ICEPT via NLEP. The S. heidelberg phage
typing scheme and phages were supplied by NLEP
(Demczuk et al., 2003). Strains that did not conform
to any recognized phage type were considered atypical
(AT).

Antimicrobial resistance testing

The Salmonella isolates were tested for resistance to
24 selected antimicrobial drugs by the agar dilution
method (Larkin et al., 2004). The antimicrobials
and breakpoints were amikacin (Amk) 16 μg/ml;
ampicillin (Amp) 32 μg/ml; amoxicillin/clavulanic
acid (Amc) 64/16 μg/ml; apramycin (Apr) 32 μg/ml;
carbadox (Crb) 30 μg/ml; cephalothin (Cef) 32 μg/ml;
ceftriaxone (Cro) 8 μg/ml; ceftiofur (Ctf) 8 μg/ml;
cefoxitin (Fox) 32 μg/ml; chloramphenicol

32 μg/ml; ciproﬂoxacin (Cip) 0.125 μg/ml; Flor-
fenicol (ﬂo) 16 μg/ml; gentamicin (Gen) 16 μg/ml;
kanamycin (Kan) 64 μg/ml; nalidixic acid (Nal)
32 μg/ml; neomycin (Neo) 16 μg/ml; nitrofurantoin

76/4 μg/ml;
tetracycline (Tet) 16 μg/ml; tobramycin (Tob) 8μg/ml
and trimethoprim (Tmp) 16 μg/ml. The reference
strains described by the National Committee for
Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS, 1999) for an-
timicrobial susceptibility tests of bacteria isolated from
animals were used as controls. An isolate was deﬁned as

resistant if it was resistant to one or more antimi-
crobials, whereas isolates that were resistant
to
two or more antimicrobials were considered as
multidrug-resistant strains.

Results

Out of the 104 sheep and 100 goats examined for the
presence of Salmonella in the body tissues and faecal
samples, Salmonella was isolated from 15 (7.4%) of the
animals of which 12 (11.5%) and 3 (3%) were sheep
and goats, respectively (Table 1). There was a statisti-
cally signiﬁcant difference (p < 0.05) in the isolation
of Salmonella between sheep and goats. From a total
of 1224 tissue and faecal samples of sheep (n = 624)
and goats (n = 600) from the two abattoirs, Salmonella
was detected in 22 (1.8%) samples. Of the 624 samples
examined from sheep, 18 (2.9%) were Salmonella pos-
itive. Salmonella was isolated from 4.8% and 7.7% of
each 104 faecal and mesenteric lymph node samples.
Salmonella was not isolated from any of the 104 di-
aphragmatic muscle samples examined. The difference
in the frequency of Salmonella isolation among fae-
cal, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, abdominal
muscle and diaphragmatic muscle samples from sheep
was statistically signiﬁcant (p < 0.05). Only 4 (0.7%)
Salmonella-positive samples were detected from a total
of 600 samples from goats (Table 1).

Twenty-two Salmonella isolates belonging to 9 dif-
ferent serovars were identiﬁed from sheep and goats
(Table 2). The common serovars were S. typhimurium,
followed by S. heidelberg, S. reading, S. give and
S. poona. The maximum number of isolates in one

liver and spleen) consisting of
two serovars (S.
typhimurium and S. typhimurium var. Copenhagen).
Two serovars (S. heidelberg and S. typhimurium) were
also detected from one sheep.

All

the eight S.

typhimurium isolates belonged
to 5 different phage types (Table 3). All isolated
phage types were detected in sheep. In goats only
S.
typhimurium phage type 193 was detected. S.
typhimurium phage types 46, 193, 2, 79, and phage

type U285 were detected. S. typhimurium var. Copen-
hagen phage type 104 and S. enteritidis phage type
5a were also identiﬁed in mesenteric lymph nodes and
faeces, respectively. All the identiﬁed phage types of
S. heidelberg were atypical.

Seven (31.8%) of the 22 Salmonella isolates were
multidrug-resistant (resistance to two or more drugs)
(Table 3). Only strains of S.
typhimurium and S.
reading were resistant. Of the S. typhimurium strains,
phage types 46 and 193 were resistant. All resistant

Salmonella isolates were detected at
the Addis
Ababa abattoir, whereas isolates from the Modjo
abattoir were susceptible to the 24 antimicrobials
tested. All Salmonella isolates were susceptible to the
antimicrobial effects of amikacin, apramycin, carba-
dox, ceftriaxone, ceftiofur, cefoxitin, ciproﬂoxacin,
ﬂorfenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidix acid,
neomycin, nitrofurantoin and tobramycin. Resistance
to the remaining 10 antimicrobials varied between
4.6% and 18.2%. Resistance to ampicillin, sulﬁsoxa-
zole, streptomycin and cephalothin (each 18.2%) was
common among the isolates, followed by tetracycline
(13.6%).

Salmonella typhimurium isolates showed resistance
to ampicillin and cephalothin, sulﬁsoxazole, strepto-
mycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and trimetho-
prim, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, chloramphenicol,
spectinomycin and tetracycline. However, S. reading
isolates showed resistance to streptomycin, sulﬁsox-
azole and tetracycline only (Table 3). All the resis-
tant strains of S. typhimurium and S. reading showed
a multidrug resistance pattern. S. typhimurium PT
193 demonstrated a multidrug resistance pattern to
up to 9 different antimicrobials (AmpAmcCefChlSpt-
StrSulSxtTmp). A resistance pattern to AmpCef and
StrSulTet was also observed. Salmonella reading iso-
lates were multiply resistant to StrSulTet (Table 3).

Discussion

The occurrence of Salmonella was higher in sheep
(11.5%) as compared to goats (3%). The variation in
the occurrence of Salmonella between sheep and goats
might be due to differences in feeding behaviour, rear-
ing areas and management in the two species. In our
study multiple (n = 6) samples were included from the
same animal, which could possibly increase the chance
of detecting a positive animal. Our ﬁnding was consis-
tent with previous reports of 2–51.5% prevalence of
Salmonella in sheep (Abdel-Ghani et al., 1987; Sierra
et al., 1995). The results, however, were higher than
those in previous studies (6.4%) of Woldemariam and
colleagues (2005) at the Elfora Debre Zeit abattoir
(Ethiopia) and other workers elsewhere (Kumar et al.,
1973; Nabbut and Al-Nakhli, 1982; Sharma et al.,
1996). The difference in the prevalence reported could
be due to differences in study sites (abattoirs) and an-
imal populations. In these studies, only one or two

sample types were examined and a higher percentage
prevalence would probably have been obtained if other
organs had been examined.

Of the sample types taken from each animal dur-
ing the study period, the mesenteric lymph nodes and
faecal samples proved to be useful indicators of infec-
tion, as most of the sheep and all Salmonella-positive
goats were detected on the basis of those samples. The
liver, spleen, abdominal and diaphragmatic samples did
not appear to harbour Salmonella on most occasions.
This indicates that the organisms did not spread beyond
the lymph nodes or if they did they were in numbers
too small to be detected by the method used (Samuel
et al., 1981; Nabbut and Al-Nakhli, 1982). The de-
tection of Salmonella in 4.8% and 2% of the faecal
samples of sheep and goats, respectively, in this study
supports earlier observations (Nabbut and Al-Nakhli,
1982; Abdel-Ghani et al., 1987; Woldemariam et al.,
2005). Usually, healthy carriers intermittently excrete
only a few salmonellae, unless they undergo some kind
of stress, for example during transport or holding in the
lairages prior to slaughter (Samuel et al., 1981).

The carrier rate of goats in mesenteric lymph nodes
was low (only 2% compared to 7.7% in sheep). Carrier
sheep and goats could serve as sources of Salmonella
contamination during and after transportation to a
slaughterhouse, increasing the risk that the meat will be
contaminated during the evisceration process and after
slaughter. When lymph nodes from infected animals are
incised during meat inspection, a substantial reservoir
of Salmonella would be exposed and be transferred to
other parts of the carcasses via equipment or personnel
(Samuel et al., 1981). The ﬁnding of a high proportion
of infected sheep (7.7%) harbouring Salmonella in their
mesenteric lymph nodes indicates the existence of a
substantial risk of cross-contamination during slaugh-
tering, subsequent handling, storage and distribution of
the carcasses.

The low prevalence of Salmonella in liver and spleen
of sheep in this study supports other ﬁndings (Kumar
et al., 1973; Nabbut and Al-Nakhli, 1982), indicating
that localization of the organisms in these organs is
most likely minimal. The liver and spleen are usu-
ally free of Salmonella at slaughter, but the surfaces
can become contaminated during processing. The ulti-
mate source of this contamination is likely to be the
Salmonella present in the gastrointestinal tract and
mesenteric lymph nodes either of the same animal or
of other animals slaughtered on the same day (Samuel

et al., 1981; Nabbut and Al-Nakhli, 1982). In the
present study, Salmonella was isolated in 1.9% of the
abdominal muscle of sheep while it was not detected in
any of the diaphragmatic muscle of sheep or diaphrag-
matic and abdominal muscles of goats, suggesting a
low contamination level of red meat of sheep and goats
during slaughtering.

Of the nine different Salmonella serovars iden-
tiﬁed in sheep and goats, some of the serovars
(S. typhimurium, S. poona, S. heidelberg, S. read-
ing and S. enteritidis) were also reported previously
(Woldemariam et al., 2005). Salmonella typhimurium
was the most prevalent serovars in this study. This
ﬁnding was consistent with previous reports (Kumar
et al., 1973; Nabbut and Al-Nakhli, 1982; Sierra et al.,
1995). In Ethiopia, S. typhimurium has been recovered
in bovine and camel mesenteric lymph nodes and beef
cuts (Alemayehu et al., 2003; Molla et al., 2004). Dif-
ferent Salmonella serovars have been previously identi-
ﬁed from sheep and goats (Woldemariam et al., 2005)
in Ethiopia. However, from those serovars identiﬁed
previously, only S. typhimurium was detected again
among the nine serovars isolated in the present study.
It is possible that those serovars could be present in
Ethiopian sheep and goats in such low levels that our
present sample size was not large enough to detect
them or they might be restricted to a certain geograph-
ical areas and sheep and goat populations of the coun-
try. It is known that the presence and distribution of
Salmonella serovars can vary geographically from re-
gion to region. While some serovars remain prevalent
over many years, others emerge or decreased over time.
The rapid international trade in agricultural, aquacul-
ture and food products has also facilitated the introduc-
tion of new Salmonella serovars into importing coun-
tries (D’Aoust, 1994).

Antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella isolates from
animals and human sources have been reported in
Ethiopia (Gebre-Yohannes et al., 1987; Mache et al.,
1997; Alemayehu et al., 2003; Molla et al., 2003).
In our study 31.8% of the Salmonella isolates from
sheep and goats were multiply resistant to antimicro-
bial drugs commonly used to treat bacterial infections
in animals and humans in Ethiopia. This could be at-
tributed primarily to the indiscriminate use and mis-
use of antimicrobials both in the veterinary and human
health sectors (Leegard et al., 1996; Molla et al., 2003).
In Ethiopia, people have easy access to antimicrobials
and can purchase them without prescription. In this

Springer

study, all the resistant strains of S. typhimurium (62.5%)
exhibited multidrug resistance. Gebre-Yohannes and
colleagues (1987) also reported that S. typhimurium
strains isolated from hospitalized human patients in
Addis Ababa were resistant
to a number of an-
timicrobials. In the present study S. reading strains
were resistant
to streptomycin, sulﬁsoxazole and
tetracycline.

Salmonella typhimurium phage type 193 is a notable
multidrug resistance strain responsible for outbreaks
in humans in the late 1980s and early 1990s, mainly
in Europe (Gebreyes and Altier, 2002). This phage
type was among the most common multidrug-resistant
strains isolated from sheep and goats in this study. This
phage type exhibited a multidrug resistance to up to
9 antimicrobials (AmpAmcCefChlSptStrSulSxtTmp).
Agricultural use of subtherapeutic doses of antimicro-
bial drugs could select for bacterial strains harbour-
ing plasmids with multiple resistance genes. The emer-
gence and prevalence of multiply resistant Salmonella
in food animals can seriously compromise public health
(D’Aoust et al., 1992). The existence of Salmonella in
Ethiopian sheep and goats in general and the detec-
tion of multidrug-resistant and pathogenic Salmonella
serovars such as S. typhimurium, S. heidelberg, S. enter-
itidis and S. reading in particular emphasize the threat
to public health.

Presencia y resistencia antimicrobiana de serovares de
Salmonella en ovejas y cabras aparentemente sanas sacri-
ﬁcadas en Etiop´ıa Central

Resumen – El presente estudio se llev´o a cabo para determinar
la incidencia, distribuci´on y pauta de resistencia antimicrobiana
de serovares de Salmonella en ovejas y cabras aparentemente
sanas sacriﬁcadas en el centro de Etiop´ıa. Se recogieron un to-
tal de 1224 muestras de heces, ganglios linf´aticos mesent´ericos,
h´ıgado, bazo, y m´usculos abdominales y diafragm´aticos, a partir

de 104 ovejas y 100 cabras. Se aisl´o Salmonella en 12 de las
104 ovejas (11.5%) y en 3 de las 100 cabras (3%). Del total de
las 624 y 600 muestras examinadas de ovejas y cabras respecti-
vamente, 18 (2.9%) y 4 (0.7%) respectivamente dieron positivas
para la Samonella. Los 22 aislados de Salmonella pertenec´ıan a 9
serovares distintos. Los serovares aislados m´as frecuentes fueron
S. typhimurium, seguido por S. heidelberg, S. reading, S. give,
y S. poona. Siete de los 22 aislados (31.8%) fueron resistentes
farmacol´ogicamente a varios antimicrobianos.
