Isolated from Chicken Meat in Turkey

Belgin Siriken, Haldun T¨urk, Tuba Yildirim, Belma Durupinar, and Irfan Erol

Abstract: This study was conducted in a Turkish province to investigate the presence of Salmonella spp. in 150 chicken
meat samples using 2 phenotyping techniques: classic culture technique (CCT) and immunomagnetic separation (IMS).
For the conﬁrmation of the isolates at molecular levels, invA gene was detected in these isolates. The presence of invA,
class 1 (Cls1) integrons, and integrase (Int1) genes was demonstrated by PCR assay; and the resistance of the isolated
Salmonella spp. strains to antibiotics was determined by disk diffusion test. All the cultural and PCR results were evaluated
together; Salmonella spp. were detected in a total of 64 (42.66%) chicken meat samples. Contamination rate was higher
in carcasses (53.33%, n = 75) than in meat pieces (32%, n = 75). When results of standard culture were compared with
IMS technique, IMS (n = 54) showed a clear superiority over the CCT (n = 38). A very high resistance rate (ࣙ89.28%)
to vancomycin, tetracycline, streptomycin, or nalidixic acid was found. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance was
present in 32.14%. Relatively lower incidence of resistance (ࣘ8.33%) to gentamicin, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and
ceftriaxone was observed. Concurrent resistance to at least 4 antibiotics was detected in 92.85% of the isolates. Cls1
integrons and Int1 were positive in 80.95% and 95.23% of the isolates, respectively. However, Int1 alone was detected
in 15.47% (n = 13). In conclusion, the high prevalence of Salmonella spp. in chicken meat may pose a potential public
health risk, and the presence of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella spp. isolate together with Cls1 integron and/or integrase
might play an important role in horizontal antibiotic gene transfer.

antibiotic properties, and carriage of class I integrons and integrase genes were investigated. High prevalence of Salmonella
spp. in consumed chicken meat can risk of public health from several ways due to (i) causing foodborne salmonellosis,
(ii) multiple antibiotic resistance properties, (iii) potential transfer of drug resistance genes to other members of the
Enterobacteriaceae and humans via Cls1 integron and/or integrase genes, and (iv) a very high resistance rate to nalidixic
acid (initial steps of the development of ciproﬂoxacin resistance).

Introduction

Increasing poultry meat production and consumption is associ-
ated with certain public health problems. Salmonella spp. are also a
serious safety concern for the food industry particularly for poul-
try and public health. According to CDC (2007; 2010) data, each
year nearly one million people are affected through consumption
of food contaminated with Salmonella spp. (CDC 2011). Similarly,
EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) (2010) has reported that
salmonellosis was the most common reported zoonotic disease in
humans accounting for 131468 conﬁrmed human cases. In the
same report, Salmonella spp. were most often detected in fresh
broiler (5.1%), turkey (5.6%), and pig meat (0.7%). Also, many
studies in Turkey (Erol and others 2004; Efe and G¨um¨us¸soy 2005;

2008) and in other countries (Capita and others 2003; Salehi and
others 2005; Bada-Alambedji and others 2006; Minami and others
2010; Aslam and others 2012; Kim and others 2012; Ta and others
2012; Thai and others 2012) have showed a high prevalence (up
to 88.4%) of contamination with Salmonella spp. in chicken meat
samples.

In addition to the problem of food-borne salmonellosis, recent
increase in global antibiotic resistance poses serious public health
issues and increased economic burden due to increased morbid-
ity and mortality in animals and humans. In the United States,
the newly released 10th National Antimicrobial Resistance Mon-
itoring System (NARMS) report describes alarming increases in
antibiotic-resistant bacteria found on retail meats. The report has
also conﬁrmed that 80% of all antibiotics used in the United States
are used not in humans but on food animals, most of which are
perfectly healthy (NARMS 2011). Multidrug resistance (MDR) in
bacteria has been associated with the use of antimicrobials for mul-
tiple purposes including treatment, prophylaxis (prevention), and
growth promotion/increased feed efﬁciency in animals (McEwen
and Fedorka-Cray 2002). Aside these purposes, an overwhelming
majority of the antibiotics are used in primary animal produc-
tion. The World Health Organization (2002) has also reported
that about half of the antimicrobials produced globally is used in
animal food, and according to data from Europe, approximately

100 mg of antimicrobials are used in animals produced for per kg
of meat for human consumption. Obviously, antimicrobial resis-
tance in bacteria and the spread of antibiotic resistance via meat
consumption have potentially serious implications from a global
public health viewpoint (Ribot and others 2002).

Reservoirs of antibiotic resistance can interact between different
ecological systems, and potential transfer of resistant bacteria or
resistant genes from animals to humans may occur through the
food chain (Witte 2000). In addition, mobile genetic elements
in Salmonella strains, such as plasmids, transposons, and integrons
play an important role in the evolution and dissemination of MDR
(Boyd and others 2002).

Integrons are one of the genetic elements involved in the acqui-
sition of antibiotic resistance. There are 2 main groups of integrons:
Mobile integrons (MIs), related to antibiotic resistance cassettes,
and Chromosomal Integrons (Cls), not related to antibiotic resis-
tance with a few exceptions (Cambray and others 2010). Mobility
of MIs is deﬁned as being associated with mobile genetic elements
(transposons or plasmids). Integrons are thus ideally suited for the
dissemination and recombination of antimicrobial drug-resistance
genes. Five different classes (Cls1 to Cls5) of MIs have been de-
ﬁned based on the sequence of the encoded integrases. Although
only Cls1, 2, and 3 have been historically involved in the spread of
multiresistance phenotypes, all 5 classes have been associated with
antibiotic-resistance determinants. Cls1 integrons are the most
widespread and clinically important, as they are detected in 22%
to 59% of Gram-negative clinical isolates (Mazel 2006) and among
genus of Salmonella (Michael and others 2006). The presence of
integrase gene (Int1) is known to be an essential part of all inte-
grons. A functional integrase is necessary to continue the catalytic
process for the insertion/deletion of gene cassettes (Hanau-Bercot
and others 2002). It is also known that the presence of integrase
is potentially indicative of strains capable of recruiting antibiotic
resistance genes (Di Conza and Gutkind 2010).

The invA gene is speciﬁc for the Salmonella spp. (Chen and
Grifﬁths 2001), thus, it constitutes a suitable PCR target in di-
agnostic applications (Rhan and others 1992). In addition to this
property, it is also a virulence gene. Virulence genes encode prod-
ucts that assist the organisms in expressing its virulence in the host
cells. There are several virulent genes (sef, pef, spv, mgtC, sop, stn, pip
A, B, D, and so on) have been among Salmonella species (Murugkar
and others 2003) and of these, invA gene, a member of genetic lo-
cus (Salmonella Pathogenity Island 1-SPI1), allows Salmonella spp.
to enter cultured epithelial cells. It is the ﬁrst gene of an operon
consisting of at least 2 additional invasion genes (Gal´an and others
1992). Lilic and others (2010) reported that the Salmonella pro-
tein InvA is one of the most highly conserved proteins of this
core of critical the type III secretion system (T3SS) components.
A number of Gram-negative bacterial pathogens utilize a highly
specialized nanomachine termed as the T3SS to achieve a re-
markable translocation of bacterial proteins across the cytoplasmic
membranes and directly into the cytoplasm of the host organism
(Cornelis 2006).

The aim of this study is to investigate (i) the presence of
Salmonella spp. in chicken meat samples using 2 different methods:
classic culture technique (CCT) and immunomagnetic separation
(IMS) technique, and superiority over the other, (ii) to employ
a conﬁrmatory PCR assay, (iii) to determine antibiotic resistance
proﬁle of the isolates, and (iv) to detect Cls1 integron and integrase
genes (Int1) of the isolates.

Materials and Methods
Sample collection

In the present study, a total of 150 chicken meat samples (75 car-
casses and 75 pieces of meat) randomly collected from supermar-
kets in Samsun province between 2008 and 2009 were analyzed.
The samples represented 12 different chicken meat producers in
Turkey. All samples were transported under refrigerated conditions
and were tested immediately for Salmonella spp.

Isolation procedure

For the 2 isolation methods, CCT and IMS, each whole chicken
carcass was aseptically transferred to a sterile polyethylene bag
and 225 mL Buffered peptone water (BPW-Oxoid, CM0509,
Basingstoke, UK) was added to the samples for the pre-enrichment
step. The carcasses were rinsed for 2 min (Baumgart 1986). Then,
carcasses were removed aseptically and the remaining rinsate in the
sampling bags was incubated at 37 ˚C for 24 h. Also, each piece
of meat samples (25 g) were transferred to a sterile polyethylene
bag containing 225 mL BPW, then homogenized (Interscience-
bagmixer 400, Saint Nom, France) and incubated at 37 ˚C for
24 h. After the incubation, 0.1 mL of pre-enrichment broth was
added to 10 mL Rappaport Vassiliadis (RV) enrichment broth
(RV-Broth-Oxoid, CM0669, Basingstoke, UK) and incubated at
42.5 ˚C for 24 h for selective enrichment. Afterwards, they were
streaked onto the media for CCT and IMS technique. The cul-
ture was streaked onto Brilliant green (Modiﬁed) agar (BGA-
Oxoid CM 329, Suppl. SR 87, Basingstoke, UK) and incubated
for up to 48 h at 37°C. After the incubation about 5 colonies sus-
pected of being Salmonella spp. from each plate were selected and
subcultured onto Tripticase Soy Agar (TSA-Oxoid-CM 131-L21,
Basingstoke, UK). The IMS procedure was applied using immuno-
magnetic beads coated with anti-Salmonella antibody (Dynabeads
anti-Salmonella; Dynal A.S., Norway) according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Brieﬂy, 20 µL of Dynabeads anti-Salmonella
was added to a 1.5-mL eppendorf tube. Then, 1 mL of selective
enrichment sample was added to it. The tube was loaded into
the Dynal Magnetic Concentrator (MPC-S rack) which removed
the magnetic plate. It was inverted 5 times to mix the sample
and beads and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The
magnetic plate was inserted into the MPCTM-S and 3 min were
allowed for proper recovery of the beads. After that, the tube cap
was opened, and the supernatant, as well as the remaining liquid in
the tube, was aspirated and discarded carefully. The magnetic plate
from the MPC-S was removed and 1 mL of wash buffer (PBS-
Tween- Phosphate Buffered Saline in Tween 20, Sigma, P3563)
was added into each eppendorf tube. The tube’s cap was closed and
the rack was inverted again several times to resuspend the beads.
The same procedure was applied 2 more times. At the end of the
IMS procedure, 100 mL of wash buffer was added to resuspend
the beads-bacteria complex, and ﬁnally 50 µL of resuspended
complex was spread onto BGA plates.

by boiling bacterial cultures. For the detection of genus-speciﬁc
invA gene (Rham and others 1992) of Salmonella spp., a single
target PCR assay described by Salehi and others (2005) was used.
S. Typhimurium (ATCC 14028) was used as a positive control.
During the procedures, a gradient thermocycler (Bio Rad-MJ
Mini-PTC-1148, Singapore) was used.

Detection of class 1 integron (Cls1) and integrase (IntI1)
genes

The single target assays for each gene were applied according to

the method described by Bass and others (1999).

The nucleotide sequences (invA, Cls1, and class 1integrase) of
the primers and the predicted product sizes are depicted in Table 1.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

The susceptibilities of the isolates to gentamicin (10 µg),
vancomycin (30 µg), chloramphenicol (30 µg), trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole (25 µg), streptomycin (10 µg), ceftriaxone
(30 µg), tetracycline (30 µg), nalidixic acid (30 µg), or ampi-
cillin (10 µg) were determined using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffu-
sion method. The resistance levels were evaluated the deﬁnitions
proposed by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI
2007, 2010) as follows: susceptible (S), intermediate-resistant (I), or
resistant (R).

Chi-square test was employed to compare the resistant and sus-
ceptibility isolates against the antibiotics. P < 0.001 was considered
as statistically signiﬁcant.

Results

All the cultural and PCR results (Figure 1) were evaluated
together, and 86 Salmonella spp. were detected in a total of 64
(42.66%) chicken meat samples (in 40 [53.33%] of the carcass and
in 24 [32%] of the meat piece samples). The study results are
shown in Figure 2. When results of standard culture technique
were compared with the IMS technique, IMS technique could
detect Salmonella spp. in 54 (36.00%) samples (32 carcasses and 22
meat pieces) and the CCT method could detect Salmonella spp.
in 38 (25.33%) samples (23 carcasses, 15 meat pieces). Although
Salmonella spp. were detected in 3 chicken meat samples using IMS
technique, invA gene was not determined.

gentamicin (4.76%), chloramphenicol (7.14%), ampicillin (8.33%),
and ceftriaxone (1.19%). Statistically signiﬁcant differences were
determined between the antibiotics and the resistance of Salmonella
strains to the analyzed antibiotics (P < 0.001) (Table 2).

Multiple resistances (ࣙ4 antibiotics) were found in 78 out of 84
(92.85%) isolates. One isolate was resistant to all antibiotics tested,
except
for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; 2 isolates (2.38%)
were resistant to 7 antibiotics, 6 isolates (7.14%) to 6 antibiotics,
21 (25%) isolates to 5 antibiotics (vancomycin, trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, tetracycline, nalidixic acid), 45
(53.7%) isolates to 4 antibiotics (vancomycin, streptomycin, tetra-
cycline, and nalidixic acid), 1 isolate to 3 antibiotics, 2 isolates to 2
antibiotics, and the other 3 isolates to a single antibiotic (Table 3).
Cls1 integrons were present in 80.95% (68/84) of the isolates
with product patterns between 400 bp and 1200 bp, most being
900 bp or 1100 bp (Figure 3). The isolates also demonstrated
more than one Cls1. In total, 80 (95.23%) isolates carried Int1
(Figure 3). This gene also existed in 67 (79.76%) of 68 isolates
containing Cls1. However, integrase gene alone was present in
13 (15.47%) isolates. Thus, most of the isolates (n = 81) carried
Cls1 integron or Int1. Although 4 isolates did not carry any Cls1
integron or Int1, they were resistant to 4 antibiotics (vancomycin,
streptomycin, tetracycline, and nalidixic acid).

Discussion

Global incidence of Salmonella spp. infections in humans has
shown a drastic increase in recent years. According to a Salmonella
Atlas in the United States, it is estimated that 1.2 million salmonel-
losis occurs each year, with more than 23000 hospitalizations and
450 deaths (CDC 2013). Therefore, it is not surprising to observe
the plenitude of studies in other countries, as well as in Turkey,
that aim to examine the prevalence of Salmonella spp. contamina-
tion in chicken meat. Some of the results from these studies are
summarized in Table 4 and 5. As can be seen from these results,
Salmonella spp. were included in 4.2% to 88.4% of the cases. Similar
to our ﬁndings, the generally high isolation rate of Salmonella spp.
in chicken meat samples indicates the fact that chicken meat has
been one of the most important sources of human salmonellosis.
The wide variation in these study ﬁndings mentioned above
factors including geographical

may be due to a number of

location, methodological differences, seasonal variations, as well
as farming and slaughtering conditions. In the present study, IMS
was able to detect Salmonella spp. in 54 (36.00%) samples and the
CCT method was able to detect Salmonella spp. in 38 (25.33%)
samples. When the results of the standard culture were compared
with the results from the IMS technique, the IMS showed a clear
superiority over the CCT (Figure 3). The reason may depend
on eliminating competitive ﬂora. A similar advantage for this ap-
proach has previously been emphasized by other authors including
Cudjoe and Krona (1997). Success of the isolation is also deter-
mined by the selective enrichment broth used. For example, the
IMS-RV broth combination has been reported to provide a higher
isolation rate than direct IMS methods without selective enrich-
ment (Ribeiro and others 2002). Success of isolation is also de-
pendent on certain other factors such as the sampling site (skin
or meat piece), sampling either from the whole carcass or meat
pieces, or the swap technique used. In a study by Capita and others
(2003), an isolation rate of 49% has been detected for Salmonella
spp. in chicken meat, compared to 55% in chicken skin. In our
study, a higher isolation rate was found in whole chicken carcasses
(n = 41) than in meat piece samples.
Antimicrobial resistance represents a serious public health prob-
lem. Food may act as a vector for the transfer of antimicrobial
resistant bacteria and antimicrobial resistance genes to humans
(Verraes and others 2013). The present study, as well as other study
results reported from around the world, also supports this view. For
instance, from Turkey, Yazıcıo˘glu and others (2005) have found
that among 58 Salmonella spp. isolates of avian origin, the most
common resistance rates were observed against nalidixic acid and
streptomycin. Kılınc¸ and Aydın (2006) have reported that none
of the 61 Salmonella spp. isolates were resistant to trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline and gentamicin, while 12 (19.67%)
out of 61 isolates were resistant to ampicillin. Although the results
of the present study are similar to that of Yazıcıo˘glu and oth-
ers (2005), they were in contrast with those of Kılınc¸ and Aydın
(2006). In our study, following vancomycin, the highest resistance
rates were observed against tetracycline (91.66%), streptomycin
(89.28%), and nalidixic acid (89.28%). One possible reason for the
high incidence of tetracycline and streptomycin resistance may be
the use of subtherapeutic doses of these antimicrobials (particularly
tetracycline) in feeds.

Ceftriaxone is a member of cephalosporin family of antibiotics
which are especially important from several aspects (Yan and others
2002). In the present study, only a single Salmonella spp. isolate
showed resistance to ceftriaxone.

Nalidixic acid plays a role in the initial steps of the development
of ciproﬂoxacin resistance and a very high rate of nalidixic acid
resistance was observed in the isolates in our study (89.28%), where
resistance to ciproﬂoxacin was not tested.

According to EFSA (2013), in 2011, a total of 8 European
Member Countries (MSs) have reported that the resistance levels
of broiler meat origin Salmonella spp. to ampicillin, sulfonamides,
and tetracyclines were high at 20.6%, 44.8%, and 43.7%, respec-
tively. The results of the study showed that the resistance rates were
8.33% (ampicillin), 32.14% (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), and
91.66% (tetracyclines). In contrast to ciproﬂoxacin resistance rates
(50.1% and 1.19% ceftriaxone resistance rates for MSs Coun-
tries and the present study results, respectively), resistance rates to
nalidixic acid in the present study were relatively higher (89.28%)
than the rates (48.8%) found in 8 MSs countries. Similar results
from both this and the studies of MSs Countries were obtained
for chloramphenicol and gentamicin.

MDR to the traditional ﬁrst-line antibiotics such as ampicillin,
chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been
deﬁned for Salmonella enterica (Crump and Minz 2010). Although
resistance to 2 of these 3 antibiotics was found in the same isolates
in our study, no triple resistance against these 3 antibiotics in the
same isolate was observed. According to CDC (2007) report, the
most common S. enterica multidrug-resistance pattern in 2004 was

ACSSuT (resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin,
sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline). In this report, multiple drug
resistance (ࣙ4 antibiotics) has found in all 78 isolates. In our study,
30 of the isolates were resistant to at least 5 antibiotics and other
48 isolates were resistant to 4 antibiotics (Table 3).

Molecular analysis of the isolates was used to determine the
presence of some characteristics that are associated with the

presence of antimicrobial resistance. It has been reported that
MDR among Salmonella serotypes and other clinical isolates is
often associated with the presence of Cls1 integrons (Leverstein-
van and others 2002; Wannaprasat and others 2011). The presence
of genes within integrons coding for antibiotic resistance and the
association of antibiotic resistance phenotypes with the presence
of integrons has been documented by several authors (Miko and
others 2005). The present study results also showed that 80.95%
and 95.23% of the Salmonella spp. isolates were found to carry Cls1
integron and Int1, respectively. So, we can say that these MDR
Salmonella spp. isolates can be transferable to humans via chicken
meat or can spread to environment. Similar results have been re-
ported from Germany, Spain, UK, Japan, China, Ethiopia, and
Iran where the prevalence of Cls1 integrons among the MDR
Salmonella serovars isolated from various types of sources such as
food of animal origin and human materials were found 11% and
65% (Guerra and others 2000; Randall and others 2004; Zhang
and others 2004; Ahmed and others 2005; Miko and others 2005;
Molla and others 2007; Firoozeh and others 2011). Another aspect
is that the presence of resistant Salmonella spp. isolates in conjunc-
tion with the detection of Cls1 integron and/or Int1 in this study
suggests that antimicrobial resistance may be attributed to a rela-
tively high number of resistant strains circulating in the chicken
farms.

In the present study, we checked for the presence of invA gene to
conﬁrm the Salmonella spp. genetically (Chen and Griﬁths 2001).
In addition to concerns previously expressed, invA gene also plays
an important role in the invasion of Salmonella to the host tissue
(Khan and others 2000). In this study, a cocktail consisting of
the 5 Salmonella spp. isolates obtained from the present study was
prepared to test for their effects on human colon adenocarcinoma
cells (HT-29) in vitro. We found that these isolates had the ability
to adhere to and invade into human colon adenocarcinoma cells
(HT-29) (unpublished data).

Conclusion

Salmonellosis and the antimicrobial resistant in the bacteria in
veterinary and human medicine constitute a big global problem
that includes Turkey. The data presented in this study demon-
strated that retail chicken meat samples were commonly contam-
inated with Salmonella spp. Therefore, chicken meat may be a
potential vehicle of transmission of the bacteria to humans. In

addition, data from the present study also showed that most of
the Salmonella spp. isolates were resistant to multiple antimicrobial
drugs. Class 1 integron and integrase genes were also present in
a total 80.95% and 95.23% Salmonella spp. isolates. The role of
integrons as mobile genetic elements playing a central role in hor-
izontal transfer of antibiotic resistance has been well documented.
Also, Cls1 integron (transferable plasmids) are considered to be the
main mechanism for the rapid spread of multidrug-resistant phe-
notypes among Salmonella spp. and other Gram-negative bacteria
(Labbate and others 2009). So, the high prevalence of integron
in drug- or multidrug-resistant Salmonella spp. in our study indi-
cated that these mobile genetic elements were common among
Salmonella spp. and drug resistance could be associated with the
presence of class 1 integrons in Salmonella spp. As a consequence,
transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes between Salmonella iso-
lates after ingestion by humans may occur.
