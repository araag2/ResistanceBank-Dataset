The  zoonotic  potential  to  cause  human  and/or  animal  infections  among  multidrug-resistant
extraintestinal  pathogenic  Escherichia  coli  from  avian  origin  was  investigated.  Twenty-seven
extraintestinal  pathogenic  E.  coli  isolates  containing  the  increased  survival  gene  (iss)   were
obtained  from  the  livers  of  healthy  and  diseased  poultry  carcasses  at  two  slaughterhouses
in   Salvador,  northeastern  Brazil.  The  antimicrobial  resistance-susceptibility  proﬁles  were
conducted  with  antibiotics  of  avian  and/or  human  use  by  the  standardized  disc-diffusion
method.  Antimicrobial  resistance  was  higher  for  levoﬂoxacin  (51.8%),  amoxicillin/clavulanic
acid  (70.4%),  ampicillin  (81.5%),  cefalotin  (88.8%),  tetracycline  (100%)  and  streptomycin
(100%).  The  minimum  inhibitory  concentrations  above  the  resistance  breakpoints  of  doxy-
cycline,  neomycin,  oxytetracycline  and  enroﬂoxacin  reached,  respectively,  88.0%,  100%,  75%
and  91.7%  of  the  isolates.  Strains  with  high  and  low  antimicrobial  resistance  were  i.p.  admin-
istered  to  Swiss  mice,  and  histopathological  examination  was  carried  out  seven  days  after
infection.  Resistance  to  goat  and  human  serum  complement  was  also  evaluated.  The  results
show  that  Swiss  mice  challenged  with  strain  2B  (resistant  to  11  antimicrobials)  provoked  a
severe  degeneration  of  hepatocytes  besides  lymphocytic  inﬁltration  in  the  liver,  whereas
the   spleen  showed  areas  of  degeneration  of  the  white  and  red  pulp.  Conversely,  the  spleen
and   liver  of  mice  challenged  with  strain  4A  (resistant  to  two  antimicrobials)  were  morpho-
logically  preserved.  In  addition,  complement  resistance  to  goat  and  human  serum  was  high
for   strain  2B  and  low  for  strain  4A.  Our  data  show  that  multidrug  resistance  and  pathogen-
esis   can  be  correlated  in  extraintestinal  pathogenic  E.  coli  strains  obtained  from  apparently
healthy  poultry  carcasses,  increasing  the  risk  for  human  public  healthy.

Introduction

isolates 

The  spread  of  multidrug  resistance  among  avian  Escherichia  coli
is  usually  attributed  to  the  selective  pressure  exerted  by  the
antimicrobials  included  in  broiler  feed  for  the  past  60  years.1
Johnson  et  al.2 reinforced  this  suspicion  since  antibiotic-
resistant  and  antibiotic-susceptible  E.  coli 
from
retail  poultry  products  had  similar  phylogenetic  background,
and  otherwise  emerged  from  the  same  source  population.
Regarding  antimicrobial  exposure  in  poultry  production,  mul-
tidrug  resistance  among  extraintestinal  pathogenic  E.  coli
(ExPEC)  allied  to  community  acquired  infections  is  increasing
in  prevalence  in  many   parts  of  the  globe.3 The  indiscriminate
use  of  antimicrobials  is  high  in  developing  countries,  where
human  antibiotics  are  often  accessible  for  non-therapeutic
uses  in  healthy  animals.4 Therefore,  colonization  of  asymp-
tomatic  poultry  by  multidrug  resistant  ExPEC  augments  the
probability  of  resistance  gene  acquisition  by  human  strains
through  the  food-chain.

Avian  pathogenic  E.  coli  (APEC)  is  commonly  reported  as
an  ExPEC  pathotype,  but  its  genotype  is  not  clearly  deﬁned.
According  to  Kwon  et  al.5 at  least  ﬁve  virulence  genes  are
present  in  APEC,  many   of  them  found  in  plasmid  pTJ100.6
However,  the  increased  survival  gene  (iss)  has  been  iden-
tiﬁed  as  a  virulence  marker  to  distinguish  between  avian
and  human  ExPEC.7 This  gene  exerts  anti-complement  resis-
tance  and  has  been  found  in  conserved  regions  of  ColV
and  ColBM  plasmids,8,9 which  are  often  identiﬁed  in  APEc
strains.6,10 Recent  ﬁndings  also  suggest  that  APEC  and  human
neonatal  meningitis  E.  coli  (NMEC)  are  subpathotypes  from
ExPEC  involved  in  pathogenesis  of  both  avian  and  human
infections.11 Therefore,  hybrid  plasmids  (ColV-  and  ColBM-
associated  plasmids)  harboring  a  number  of  distinct  virulence
genes  and  MDR-encoding  islands  can  also  be  present  in  ExPEC
isolates.11 Consequently,  it  is  now  clear  that  selected  high-
virulent  and  multidrug  resistant  ExPEC  strains  of  avian  origin
represent  subpathotypes  of  great  danger  to  human  public
health.

Brazil  has  ranked  ﬁrst  in  the  world  in  exports  of  poultry
meat  since  2004.12 Typical  selections  of  poultry  in  Brazilian
slaughterhouses  take  into  account  macroscopic  alterations
that  can  result  in  discarding  carcasses.13 However,  sub-clinical
symptoms  are  not  always  perceived  and  often  do  not  show
a  clue  of  the  presence  of  pathogenic  microorganisms.  Thus,
the  risk  of  virulence  and  drug  resistance  gene  transmission
between  avian  E.  coli  obtained  trough  the  food-chain  and
intestinal  commensal  E.  coli  is  increasing.  The  goal  of  the
present  study  was  to  investigate  the  pathogenesis  to  mam-
malian  hosts  of  selected  multidrug  resistant  ExPEC  strains
obtained  from  healthy  poultry  carcasses  in  Salvador,  Brazil.

Carcasses  without  macroscopic  alterations  were  considered
healthy  and  approved  for  human  consumption.  The  organs
were  collected  under  sterile  conditions.  All  bacterial  strains
were  identiﬁed  through  biochemical  tests,  and  the  presence  of
the  iss  gene  was  determined  according  to  the  method  reported
in  a  previous  study.14 The  isolates  were  maintained  in  tubes

Antimicrobial   resistance-susceptibility   proﬁle   of   ExPEC
strains

The  resistance-susceptibility  proﬁles  to  antimicrobials  of
avian  or  human  use  were  determined  by  the  standard  disc-
diffusion  method,  following  the  recommendations  of  the
Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards  Institute  (formally,  National
Committee  for  Clinical  Laboratory  Standards).15 Brieﬂy,  ﬁlter
paper  discs  5  mm  in  diameter  impregnated  with  antibiotics
(Cecon)  were  added  to  cultures  in  Petri  dishes  (0.5  on  the
McFarland  scale,  corresponding  to  108 cells/mL)  containing
Mueller–Hinton  agar  (Oxoid).  After  24  h  incubation  at  35
C,  the
diameter  of  the  inhibition  zone  was  measured  with  a  caliper.
All  tests  were  carried  out  in  duplicate  against  13  antimicro-
bials  and  the  results  were  interpreted  as  sensitive,  moderately
sensitive  or  resistant.  The  breakpoints  for  resistance  were
those  recommended  by  the  CLSI.  The  overall  resistance  rate
was  calculated  as  the  number  of  non-susceptible  isolates

divided  by  the  total  number  of  isolates.  Multidrug  resistance
was  determined  when  bacterial  isolates  were  resistant  to  four
antimicrobials  of  at  least  three  different  classes.  The  isolates
obtained  from  a  single  sample  with  an  identical  antibiotic
resistance/sensitivity  proﬁle  were  treated  as  a  single  strain.
In  this  case,  bacterial  replicates  were  not  conducted.

antimicrobials   used   on   Brazilian   farms

inhibitory  concentration 

The  minimum 
(MIC)  of  antimi-
crobials  commonly  used  on  Brazilian  farms  (doxycycline,
neomycin,  oxytetracycline  and  enroﬂoxacin)  was  measured
through  the  broth  dilution  method  in  concentrations  ranging
␮g/mL.16 The  MIC   was  the  lowest  concen-
from  1.9  to  1000 
tration  that  caused  visible  inhibition  of  growth,  while  the
minimum  bactericidal  concentration  (MBC)  was  the  lowest
concentration  resulting  in  no  growth  after  the  incubation
period  of  24  h  at  37
C.  All  assays  were  performed  in  duplicate
with  25  ExPEC  strains  resistant  to  4–11  antimicrobials  through
the  disc-diffusion  method.  A  list  of  antimicrobials  authorized
by  the  Brazilian  government  to  be  included  in  broiler  feed  is
shown  in  Table  2.

Complement   resistance   assay

The  complement  resistance  test  was  carried  out  with  selected
ExPEC  strains  obtained  from  healthy  carcasses,  and  with  dis-
tinct  drug  resistance  proﬁle,  following  the  method  adapted
from  Samuelsen  et  al.17 Samples  of  blood  were  obtained  from
goats  and  a  healthy  human  volunteer  under  sterile  condi-
tions  and  allowed  to  coagulate.  The  blood  was  centrifuged
(7000  rpm/5  min)  and  blood  serum  was  separated  into  a  new
␮L  of  E.  coli  strains
tube.  Brieﬂy,  190 
(107 cells/mL)  were  cultured  together  in  wells  of  sterile  Elisa
plates,  and  incubated  at  37
C  for  180  min.  Then,  aliquots  of
␮L  were  sampled  at  times  0,  60,  120  and  180  min,  and  added
10 
to  Petri  dishes  containing  MacConkey  agar  for  enumeration
of  the  colony  forming  units.  The  absence  of  speciﬁc  antibod-

Animals

Adult  male  Swiss  mice  weighing  approximately  35  g,  obtained
from  Keizo-Azami  Immunopathology  Laboratory  (LIKA/UFPE),
were  used.  The  animals  were  kept  in  an  animal  house  with  free
access  to  water  and  commercial  sterile  diet  (Purina,  Paulínia,
SP,  Brazil).  The  mice  were  handled  according  to  established
experimental  procedures.

Experimental   infection   with   selected   ExPEC   strains

intraperitoneal 

The  mice  were  separated  into  three  groups  (n  =  5)  and  chal-
lenged  by  the 
(i.p.)  route  with  0.2  mL   of
bacterial  suspensions  containing  106 CFU/mL.  Experimental
infections  were  carried  out  with  strains  4A,  41A  and  2B.  Clin-
ical  symptoms  such  as  prostration,  weight  loss  and  mortality
were  observed  daily  for  seven  days  post-infection.  Survivors
were  sacriﬁced  under  anesthesia  with  Halothane  (Halocarbon
Laboratories,  USA).  Sections  of  the  liver  were  submitted  to
enumeration  of  colony  forming  units  (CFU/g)  and  histological
examination.

Enumeration   of   colony   forming   units

The  spleens  and  livers  were  dissected,  weighed  and  macera-
ted  in  PBS  (1:10  or  1:100,  w/v)  under  sterile  conditions.  Serial
decimal  dilutions  were  made  and  0.1  mL   aliquots  were  plated
onto  MacConkey  agar  (Oxoid).  The  colonies  were  counted  after
incubation  at  37
C  for  24  h  and  the  results  expressed  as  CFU/g
of  organ.

◦

Histological   examination

Tissues  were  ﬁxed  in  10%  formaldehyde  and  processed  for
␮m)   were  stained  with
parafﬁn  embedding.  The  sections  (5 
hematoxylin–eosin  and  the  slides  were  coded  and  examined
by  a  single  pathologist,  who  was  unaware  of  the  experimental
conditions  of  each  group.

Statistical   analyses

The  statistical  signiﬁcance  of  data  was  assessed  by  analysis
of  variance  (ANOVA),  followed  by  Student’s  t-test.  The  level  of
signiﬁcance  was  determined  as  p  <  0.05.

Results

The  antimicrobial  resistance-susceptibility  proﬁles  of  27
extraintestinal  pathogenic  E.  coli  strains  from  carcasses  of
healthy  and  diseased  poultry  are  shown  in  Table  3.  The
majority  of  ExPEC  were  resistant  to  at  least  four  antibi-
otics  from  different  classes.  The  most  prevalent  phenotypes
were  resistant  to  levoﬂoxacin  (51.8%),  amoxicillin/clavulanic
acid  (70.4%),  ampicillin  (81.5%),  cefalotin  (88.8%),  tetracycline
(100%)  and  streptomycin  (100%).  The  overall  multidrug  resis-
tance  varied  from  4  to  11  antimicrobials  and  reached  92.6%  of

against  89.9%  of  ExPEC.  The  MIC   and  MBC   of  typical  antimi-
crobials  used  in  Brazilian  farms  were  determined  for  those
ExPEC  strains  resistant  to  at  least  4  antimicrobials.  The  level
of  resistance  against  doxycycline,  neomycin,  enroﬂoxacin  and
oxytetracycline  reached,  respectively,  88.0%,  100%,  75%  and
91.7%  of  the  strains  (Table  4).

The  complement  resistance  to  goat  serum  was  high  for
strains  2B  and  46  and  low  for  strains  4A  and  41A,  whereas
resistance  to  human  serum  was  high  for  strains  32,  46  and
2B  and  low  for  strains  44  and  4A  (Fig.  1).  Experiments  carried
out  with  laboratory  animals  have  shown  that  Swiss  mice  chal-
lenged  with  strains  4A,  41A  and  2B  can  survive  seven  days  after

Discussion

Poultry-associated  diseases  caused  by  ExPEC  cause  massive
economic  losses  in  the  food  industry.18–20 However,  the  broad
use  of  antimicrobials  by  poultry  farmers  in  recent  decades
has  led  to  the  emergence  of  multidrug  resistant  strains  in
many  parts  of  the  globe.21–24 Additionally,  among  multidrug
resistant  E.  coli  from  chickens  and  piglets  in  China,  97%  har-
bored  the  iss  gene,  suggesting  this  gene  could  also  be  used  as
a  multidrug  resistance  marker.22 In  Brazil,  a  previous  study

showed  that  the  rates  of  multidrug  resistance  among  avian
E.  coli  reached  77.5%.25 Regarding  ExPEC  strains  harboring
the 
iss  gene,  we  conﬁrmed  that  the  majority  were  resis-
tant  to  several  antimicrobials  beyond  those  authorized  for
inclusion  in  broiler  feed.  Although  the  number  of  strains
investigated  was  small,  the  levels  of  antimicrobial  resistance
to  ampicillin,  gentamicin,  streptomycin,  ciproﬂoxacin,  chlor-
ramphenicol  and  tetracycline  were  very  high  in  comparison
to  the  levels  found  in  a  recent  study  carried  out  with  101  E.  coli
strains  from  broilers  and  layer  hens  with  colibacillosis  infec-
tions  in  Bangladesh.26

Additionally,  we  have  shown  that  a  great  number  of  avian
␤-lactamase  producing  strains,  since  resis-
ExPEC  are  probably 
tance  to  amoxycillin/clavulanic  acid  was  present  in  70.4%
isolates.  Oteo  et  al.27 reported  that  resistance  to
of  the 
amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid  is  increasing  among  E.  coli  from
human  origin  in  Spanish  hospitals,  affecting  5.1%  of  9090
blood  isolates.  Considering  the  food-chain,  it  is  worrying  that
the  only  inhibitory  drug  against  all  avian  ExPEC  is  carbapenem
imipinem,  restricted  to  human  use.  Also  of  particular  con-
cern  are  the  resistance  of  avian  ExPEC  to  ﬂuoroquinoles  such
as  enroﬂoxacin,  which  are  similar  to  antibiotics  being  used
in  human  medicine.28 For  instance,  the  increasing  resistance
of  E.  coli  strains  to  ciproﬂoxacin  has  been  detected  in  several
international  studies.29,30 Enroﬂoxacin  has  been  withdrawal
from  non-therapeutic  use  in  the  poultry  industry  in  the  United
States.31 In  Europe,  the  drug  cannot  be  used  in  the  animals
from  which  eggs  are  produced  for  human  consumption.32
However,  in  this  study  the  level  of  antimicrobial  resistance
to  doxycycline,  neomycin,  enroﬂoxacin  and  oxytetracycline
reached  alarming  levels.  Although  we  cannot  conﬁrm  that
Brazilian  farmers  restrict  their  use  of  such  antimicrobials  to
treatment  regimens,  it  was  clear  that  these  drugs  should  no
longer  be  used  on  Brazilian  poultry  farms.

Avian  ExPEC  strains  have  been  genetically  associated  with
human  E.  coli  causing  urinary  infections.6 Additionally,  E.  coli
strains  of  the  EcoR  group  B2  related  to  human  and  animal
extraintestinal  infections  have  been  detected  among  APEC
strains  obtained  from  diseased  and  healthy  chickens.33 In
spite  of  the  implications  of  avian  ExPEC  in  carcasses  of  healthy
poultry  is  unclear,  a  previous  study  in  the  UK  showed  that
samples  of  imported  chicken  breasts  were  often  positive  for
E.  coli  with  CTX-M-2  genotype  related  to  human  infections
in  South  America.34 Our  data  shows  that  resistance  of  avian
E.  coli  to  serum  complement  lyses  in  mammalian  hosts  was
not  directly  related  to  the  presence  of  the  iss  gene.  This  ﬁnding
suggests  that  other  genetic  determinants  among  E.  coli  of  avian
origin  must  be  related  to  human  serum  resistance.  Addition-
ally,  multidrug-resistant  ExPEC  strains  41A  and  2B  were  often
more   resistant  to  goat  and  human  serum  complement,  and
also  more   virulent  to  the  experimentally  infected  mice  than
strain  4A,  which  is  sensitive  to  the  majority  of  antimicrobials.
Previous  studies  have  shown  the  correlation  between
serum  resistance  and  virulence  of  E.  coli  causing  diseases
in  turkeys  and  chickens.35 Moreover,  the  characterization
a  transferable  hybrid  plasmid  pAPEC-O103-ColBM  encod-
ing  multidrug  resistance  and  pathogenicity  was  recently
described.11 Even  though  virulence  and  multidrug  resistance
genes  are  not  uniformly  distributed  among  conjugative  plas-
mids,  the  diversity  of  avian  ExPEC  with  zoonotic  potential  to

cause  human  diseases  can  be  more   frequent  than  perceived.
For  example,  in  the  present  study  the  risk  for  human  health
was  particularly  observed  for  strain  2B,  obtained  from  poultry
carcasses  approved  for  human  consumption.  Thus,  an  early
diagnosis  procedure  should  be  followed  on  poultry  farms  and
at  slaughterhouses  to  identify  hazardous  microorganisms  in
asymptomatic  poultry,  and  therefore  eliminate  carcasses  that
are  not  proper  for  human  consumption.  The  data  reinforce  the
general  concern  about  the  spread  of  multidrug-resistance  and
virulence  genes  between  avian  and  human  E.  coli  through  the
food-chain.
