Abstract

The aim of this study was to characterize at the molecular level the different stains of Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli
that were isolated from meat-based fast food in Lebanon. In addition, this study evaluated the resistance of those strains to
different antimicrobials that are commonly used. The foods included were Lahm-bi-Ajeen (LBA, meat pies) and Shawarma
(Lebanese meat sandwiches similar to Gyros and Donairs, containing meat, vegetables, and sesame seeds-oil-based sauce).
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to characterize and identify the strains of both bacteria. Salmonella species
characterization was performed using rfb genes cluster genetic marker, while that of E. coli strains were carried out based on
stx1, stx2, eaeA, fliC, and ehlyA virulence markers. The characterized strains were then tested for their response to various
antimicrobials. The results showed that the tested foods were contaminated with Salmonella paratyphi (serogroup A) and Shiga
Toxin (Stx)-producing E. coli (STX-EC). The PCR showed that 75% of E. coli tested strains was positive in PCR performed
with stx1 primers, one of which was eaeA positive. Two of the tested strains were positive using PCR with fliC primers.

The resistances of the various strains were evaluated using the following antimicrobials: Oxacillin, Teicoplanin,
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, Gentamicin, Clindamycin, Cefotaxime, Cefuroxime, Erythromycin, and Vancomycin. Bacteria
were highly resistant to one or more of the tested antimicrobials. Approximately 69% of E. coli and 77.8% of Salmonella spp.
to four antimicrobials: Oxacillin, Teicoplanin,
exhibited resistance. Salmonella spp. were shown to be 100% resistant
Clindamycin, Vancomycin, and Erythromycin, while E. coli was 100% resistant
to Teicoplanin and Trimethoprim/
sulfamethoxazole. The most interesting findings were the high susceptibility of the E. coli to Gentamicin (100%). Highest

resistance in the case of Salmonella spp. was seen against Cefotaxime (74%). Those two antimicrobials are commonly used for
the treatment of enteric infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. The results showed that meat-based fast foods in Lebanon
could be a public health hazard, especially Shawarma, as they may act as a potential vehicle for many antimicrobial-resistant
pathogenic organisms. Improper hygienic standards and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials are two of the main causes for the
prevalence of these pathogenic resistance strains in Lebanon. These results will emphasize the need to implement protective
measures and more emphasis will be placed on the application of hygienic practices to reduce the levels of food contamination.

1. Introduction

The importance of food as a vehicle for

the
transmission of many diseases has been documented
for a long time especially in the developing countries
where hygienic standards are not strictly followed and
enforced. The presence of these microorganisms can
lead to many food-borne outbreaks. Furthermore, the
wide application of antimicrobials has led to large-
scale dissemination of bacteria resistant to antimicro-
bials in the environment. Infection caused by those
resistant strains usually lead to a high fatality rate than
especially among immuno-comprised individuals
(Holmberg et al., 1984). The identification of patho-
genic organisms is highly crucial for surveillance,
prevention, and control of food-borne diseases. In
addition, studying antimicrobial resistance in humans
and animals is important in order to (a) detect changes
patterns in resistance, (b) implement control measures
on the use of antimicrobial agents, and (c) prevent the
spread of multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria
(Duijkeren et al., 2003).

Considering the marked importance of Salmonella
spp. and Escherichia coli (E. coli) organisms as food-
borne pathogens, we aimed in this study at character-
izing the different strains of Salmonella spp. and E.
in meat-based fast food in
coli
Lebanon and to evaluate their antimicrobial resistance
patterns.

that are present

Salmonellosis has become one of main causative
agents of enteric infections in humans and animals
(Tauxe, 1996). Several Salmonellosis outbreaks have
been documented worldwide due to the consumption
of contaminated meat in the last decade (Liewellyn et
al., 1998).

In Salmonella spp., the rf b gene cluster encodes
for the O antigens of Salmonella spp. polysaccharides

(Lee et al., 1992). Variations among different O
antigen structures are manifested in the types of sugar
present or the arrangement of sugars. This variability
provides the basis for serotyping Salmonella spp. into
serogroups (Lee et al., 1992). In our study, this highly
polymorphic rf b gene cluster has been targeted as a
molecular marker to detect Salmonella spp. serovars
in contaminated meat-based fast food in Lebanon.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure was
performed using four sets of primers that amplify
the rf b(B), rf b(C1), rf b(C2) and rf b(D) genes of the
rf b cluster, respectively (Luk et al. 1993; Lee et al.,
1992).

Escherichia coli on the other hand is common,
usually harmless, bacteria of the human intestinal
flora. However,
five groups of E. coli-causing
diarrhea in humans and other warm-blooded animals
have been identified (Brook et al., 1994; Wasteson,
2001). These include enterotoxinogenic E. coli
(ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enteroag-
gregative E. coli
(EAEC), enteroinvasive E. coli
(EIEC), and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli
(EHEC).
The later includes Shiga Toxin (Stx)-Producing E.
coli (STX-EC).

Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing E. coli (STX-EC), also
known as Verotoxin-producing E. coli, is associated
with infant diarrhea, haemorrhagic colitis, thrombiotic
thrombocytic purpura, and hemolytic uremic syn-
drome in humans (Griffin and Tauxe, 1991). E. coli
O157:H7, which belongs to STX-EC group, is the
most common serotype isolated from individuals with
haemorrhagic colitis (E. coli O157:H7). Outbreaks of
infection with those bacteria have emerged due to the
consumption of contaminated animal-derived food
products (Belongia et al., 1991; Borezyk et al., 1987).
Research reveals that E. coli O157:17 infections are
endemic in cattle, goat, sheep, and other farmed

animals, with the cattle being the primary source of
this pathogen (Langreid et al., 1999).

p.m. All samples were analyzed within 2 h after their
arrival to the laboratory.

Different molecular markers throughout STX-EC
genomic DNA are now being used for the detection of
STX-EC, using mainly Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) for this purpose (Jackson, 1991; Karch and
Meyer, 1989). In this study, five genes were targeted
for amplification (stx1, stx2, eaeA, ehlyA, and f liC),
using eight different sets of oligonucleotide primers.
Sometimes, two different sets of primers were used to
amplify the same gene, as described in the literature.
isolates
were tested for their susceptibility to nine different
antimicrobials. Moreover,
the role of plasmids in
conferring antimicrobial resistance was studied by
transforming plasmid preparations from different
isolates into E. coli wild type bacteria, MG1655.

To achieve our aim, different bacterial

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sample collection

Lahm-bi-Ajeen (LBA, meat pies) and Shawarma
(Lebanese meat sandwiches similar to Gyros and
Donairs, containing meat, vegetables, sesame seeds
oil, and other ingredients) samples were randomly
collected from five areas in Lebanon. These areas
included Beirut, Mount Lebanon, north (Tripoli
mainly), south (Sidon mainly), and east (the Bekaa
Valley). The distributions of samples were as follows:
40% of the samples obtained from Beirut, 20% from
Mount Lebanon, and 13% from each of the north, the
south, and the east of Lebanon. Samples were
collected over an 11-month period from 37 food
establishments. These food establishments ranged
from restaurants to fast food outlets to small kiosks
and street vendors. Each establishment was visited on
at least two occasions and during the summer and
winter seasons. A total of 95 samples were aseptically
collected in the same way delivered to the consumer.
Samples were then packaged in sterile Whirl-Pak bags
and brought to the laboratory on ice in a cooler (b8 8C)
within 2 h from the time of purchase. Duplicate
samples were obtained whenever possible. In the
Shawarma sampling, a sharp knife was used to cut
meat from the surface. All samples were collected
during lunchtime; no samples were obtained after 3:00

2.2. Bacterial isolation and bacteriological analysis

 1 to 10

( M i x 1 A E S L a b o r a t o r i e s ,

Samples of Lahm-bi-Ajeen (LBA) and Shawarma
were subjected to various biological tests. To isolate
bacteria, a 25-g portion was weighed aseptically in a
sterile stomacher bags (Seward Medical StomacherR
Bags), diluted with 225 ml of sterilized 0.1% w/v
peptone water (Oxoid Media) and macerated in a
s t o m a c h e r
r e f :
AESAP1040) for 3 min. For isolation and counting,
 6 were
serial dilutions ranging from 10
performed by adding 1 ml of homogenate to 9 ml
sterilized peptone water (1:10 dilution factor). Bacter-
iological analyses were performed by plating 0.1 ml of
each dilution on agar plates. Plates were then
incubated at 37 8C for 48 h, and colonies were
counted. The following bacteria were isolated: indica-
tor bacteria (Aerobic plate count and E. coli) and
pathogenic organisms (Salmonella spp. and STX-EC).
Bacteriological analyses were done according to
American Public Health Association (APHA, 2001).
All bacteriological media used were of Oxoid. Plate
Count Agar (PCA) was used for aerobic plate count
(APC), MacConkey Agar (MCA) for E. coli detection,
Sorbitol MacCankoky Agar (SMAC) for STX-EC, and
Bismuth Sulfate Agar (BSA) for Salmonella spp.
detection. Purple colonies on MCA were identified as
E. coli, whereas white colonies on SMAC were
presumptive STX-EC and were therefore stereotyped
by PCR for confirmation. On the other hand, brown to
black colonies on BSA were identified as presumptive
Salmonella spp. and were then subjected to PCR tests
for further confirmation.

2.3. DNA extraction

Total bacterial DNA was extracted as described by
Ausubel et al. (1987). Briefly, bacteria were grown on
Brain Heart Infusion (BHI; Oxoid media) broth over
night at 37 8C, and then bacterial cells were harvested
by centrifugation and lysed with sodium lauryl
sulfate. DNA was extracted from the lysate with
phenol-chloroform and precipitated with isopropanol.
A 100–200-ng DNA template was used per 25 Al
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reaction.

2.4. PCR assays

For Salmonella spp. detection, primers for PCR
were selected based on the rf b gene clusters specific
for Salmonella spp. serogroups B, C2, and D, as
reported by Luk et al. (1993, 1997). The primers for
Salmonella spp. serovar C1 were designed based on
the sequence of Salmonella enterica group C1 rf b
gene cluster, as described by Lee et al. (1992). Primer
sequences used in the PCR are listed in Table 1. DNA
amplification was performed following the protocol of
Luk et al. (1993, 1997) with some modifications:
detection of PCR products by gel electrophoresis and
photography of agarose gels were carried out as
indicated by Gillespie et al. (1997). Briefly concern-
ing the detection for STX-EC, primers were selected
based on five genes specific for STX-EC strains.

Primers to amplify Shiga toxins 1 and 2 (stx1 and
stx2) genes, also named as slt1 and slt2, were selected
as shown by Osek and Gallein (2002) and Victor et al.
(1992) (Table 2). Due to mutations that may occur
spontaneously in nature, many gene sequences might
be affected. For this reason, two sets of primers were
used to amplify each of stx1 and stx2 genes (Table 2).
This is in addition to the fact that different sets of
primers were reportedly used to amplify the above-
mentioned genes. STEC primers were used to amplify
both stx1 and stx2 in combination, as described by
Reischl et al. (2002). The three other genes that were
targeted for amplification were eacA gene, encodes
for intimin gamma, ehlyA, encodes for enterohemo-
lysin, and f liC, encodes for H7, as described by
Reischl et al. (2002) and Osek and Gallein (2002),
respectively (Table 2). Amplification of bacterial

DNA was performed in 50-Al volumes containing
150–200-ng DNA templates; 2 mM MgC12 (AB-gene
products); 1X reaction buffer (AB-gene products); 0.2
mM each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP (AB-gene
products); 1.25 AM of primer; and 1U of Thermus
aquaticus (Taq) DNA polymerase (AB-gene prod-
ucts). Amplification was performed using a DNA
thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) for 35 cycles for 3 min at 93
8C, 30 s at 55 8C, and 2 min at 72 8C, and a final
extension at 75 8C for 10 min. Negative controls (no
DNA template) were included with every PCR assays.
After the PCR, 10-Al aliquots were analyzed through
submarine electrophoresis with 0.1% agarose gel
containing 0.25 Ag ethidium bromide per ml. The
DNA samples were analyzed through agarose gel
electrophoresis, visualized through UV transmission,
and photographed.

2.5. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Characterized strains were tested for their suscept-
ibility to nine antimicrobials, using the disk diffusion
method as set by the National Committee for Clinical
Laboratory standards (1997)
(NCCLS). Briefly,
organisms were grown in a shaking water bath at 37
8C until a 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard was
obtained. A volume of 0.1 ml of the culture was then
spread over Brain Heart Infusion agar (BHIA, Oxoid)
plates. Antimicrobial disks impregnated with either of
the following antimicrobials; Oxacillin (1 Ag), Teico-
planin (30 Ag), Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
(1.25+23.75 Ag), Gentamicin (10 Ag), Clindamycin
(2 Ag), Cefotaxime (30 Ag), Cefuroxime (30 Ag),
Erythromycin (15 Ag) and Vancomycin (30 Ag) were
placed on the surface of inoculated agar plates. Zones
of inhibition around each antimicrobial disk were
measured after an incubation period of 24 h at 37 8C.
Using NCCLS guidelines, each organism was classi-
fied either resistant or susceptible to the antimicro-
bials. Intermediate-resistant and resistant strains were
grouped together. Antimicrobial disks were purchased
from BioMerieux, France.

2.6. Plasmid extraction and transformation

Plasmid DNA was extracted using Qiagen Plasmid
Mini Kit according to the manufacture’s guideline
(Qiagen, 40724 Hilden, Germany), and DNA was run

using agarose gel electrophoresis, visualized through
UV transmission, and photographed. To decipher the
role of plasmids in conferring antimicrobial resistance,
a number of 21 different plasmid preparations from E.
coli and Salmonella spp. were transformed into wild
type E. coli MG1655 strain (Provided by Dr. Khattar,
Biology Department, AUB), and transformants were
selected on BHI agar plates supplemented with
different antimicrobials of specific concentrations:
Ampicillin (50 Ag/ml), Chloramphenicol (20 Ag/ml),
Naladixic acid (15 Ag/ml), Neomycin (50 Ag/ml), and
Tetracycline (15 Ag/ml). Transformation procedure
was carried out as described by Sambrook (1989). In
brief, 200-Al competent cells, prepared in the presence
CaCl2, were mixed with 5–10 ng plasmids, incubated
on ice for 30 min, and then heat-shocked at 42 8C for
90 s. Then, 1 ml of Lauria Broth (LB) was added to
the mixture and incubated at 37 8C to enable bacterial
growth. A volume of 100-Al aliquot was then spread
on BHI agar plates supplemented with antimicrobials
of specific concentrations. Plates were then incubated
at 37 8C for 24 h, and transformants were detected by
colony formations.

3. Results

3.1. Bacteriological counts and molecular character-
ization of Salmonella paratyphi and STX-EC using
PCR

Regarding the distribution of microbial population
in LBA, E. coli and Salmonella spp. were not
detected at all. On the other hand, 55% of the samples
was contaminated with E. coli, whereas contamina-
tion with suspected Salmonella spp. was detected in
47.5% of the samples.

Random isolates from the different samples were
subjected to biochemical tests. A number of those
tested positive for Salmonella spp. Ten of those
Salmonella spp. isolates with different morphologies
were then analyzed by PCR for the rf b gene cluster
molecular marker. Isolates were classified according
to the size of band visualized on agarose gel electro-
phoresis (Table 3). It was shown that 50% of tested
isolates was positive using PCR performed with
primers rf b(D), yielding a band of approximately
700 bp in size (Fig. 1a and b). Therefore,

isolates could be classified as S. paratyphi A,
Serogroup A. Two of the tested isolates gave a very
high intense band of 550 bp with rf b(C2), whereas the
expected size is 795 bp (data not shown; Table 4).

Concerning E. coli, 12 isolates were analyzed by
PCR for the stx1, stx2, stx1+stx2, eaeA, and ehlyA
virulence markers. Those isolates were also tested for
f liC genetic marker, which encodes for the production
of E. coli O157:H flagellar protein. Taking into
consideration the fact
that mutations could occur
spontaneously in nature, alteration in the sequence
reading chain may result. To be on the safe side and to
avoid missing any strains from the different isolates,
we opted to use two sets of primers for the detection
of the Stx genes (Table 2). It was found that 75% of
the tested isolates was stx1-positive, using PCR
performed with stx1 primer (Table 5; Fig. 2a–c), one
of which was positive with eaeA primer, giving a
product of approximately 380 bp in size (Fig. 3c). On
the other hand, two of the tested strains showed a very

intense band of approximately 1100 bp in PCR
performed with f liC primer, whereas the expected
band has a size of 984 bp (Fig. 2b).

Hence,

those isolates, which showed a 348-bp
band with stx1 primer, could be classified as enter-
ohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) or more specifically
STX-EC,
two of which could be classified as
O157:H7. It is noteworthy that none of the tested
strain has shown positive results using PCR per-
formed with the rest of the primers.

3.2. Antimicrobial susceptibility assays

A total number of 16 bacterial isolates were tested
for their antimicrobials susceptibility, using the agar
disk diffusion method tables (Tables 6 and 7). In the
case of E. coli, 9 out of 12 were confirmed positive
by PCR and thus included in the study. On the other
hand, out of the 10 Salmonella spp. isolates, five
were rf b(D)-positive and two were rf b(C2)-positive,
and those were included in the study. It was found
that 77.8% of the tested Salmonella spp. isolates was
resistant to at least one of the tested antimicrobials.

agarose gels. The results showed that 74% of the
tested isolates had a plasmid which exceeds 15 kbp
in size (Fig. 3). Such big plasmids could harbor a
lot of genes including the antimicrobial-resistant
ones. Five different plasmid preparations (three from
E. coli strains and two from Salmonella ones) that
carried the large plasmids were then transformed
into the wild type E. coli MG16155. Transformants

were grown on media containing different antimi-

incorporated in the media included Tetracycline,
Ampicillin, Neomycin, Naladixic acid, or Chloram-
phenicol.
Interestingly, Neomycin and Naladixic
acid resistances were associated with all successful
transformations. However, only two of the trans-
formants were Ampicillin-resistant, and none of
them was Tetracycline- or Chloramphenicol-resis-

4. Discussion

In 2001, the Lebanese Ministry of Health reported
3497 cases attributed to food/water-borne diseases
(http://www.public-health.gov.lb, 2003–2004). How-
ever,
there is little information concerning the
molecular characterization of pathogenic bacterial
strains in Lebanon. Considering the marked impor-
tance of E. coli and Salmonella infection organisms as
food-borne pathogens, we aimed in this study to
evaluate the levels of contamination by those organ-
isms in meat-based fast food in Lebanon. The isolated
strains were characterized at the molecular level using
resistance
PCR and evaluated their antimicrobial
patterns to different antimicrobials. Lastly,
the
involvement of plasmids in antimicrobial resistance
exhibited by the isolated bacteria was investigated.

Bacteriological analysis performed showed a dif-
ferential distribution of bacteria between Shawarma
and LBA. Shawarma showed a higher
level of

contamination than Lahm-bi-Ajeen (LBA). The fact
that Shawarma had a higher level of contamination
than Lahm-bi-Ajeen can be attributed to many
reasons. LBA is usually cooked in the oven at 500
8C for around 5 min, which possibly eliminates all
kinds of bacteria present. LBA is often served with
pressed lemon that increases its acidity and likely
reduces bacterial growth. Moreover,
there is less
handling in the case of LBA as compared to that of
Shawarma. In the case of Shawarma, after cutting the
meat, most of the food handlers adds vegetables and
sauce with their bare hands.

Some factors that may attribute to bacterial
contamination of Shawarma could be due to the way
Shawarma is cooked. It is usually sliced meat on a
rotating stick, which leads to cooking of the outer
meat while the inside remains rare. Also, the addition
of accessory ingredients to Shawarma, such as
vegetables and Tahina sauce (made from sesame
seeds oil), could be another source of contamination.
Vegetables could be contaminated with soil (Okafo et
al., 2003), and they reduce the temperature of the meat
thus providing a conducive environment for bacterial
contamination (Raiden et al., 2003). Another source
of contamination may be attributed to the Tahina

S. Harakeh et al. / Science of the Total Environment 341 (2005) 33–44

sauce used, which was recently found to be contami-
nated with Salmonella spp.

spp. isolates to Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, only
14.3% was found to be susceptible in our study.

After the microbiological examination, rapid and
sensitive methods were used to characterize bacterial
strains in meat-based fast food. DNA-based assays
were followed for the identification of pathogens
because these methods rely on nucleic acid composi-
tion of bacterium instead of the phenotypic expression
that might vary under culture conditions.

For Salmonella species identification, four sets of
primers were used to detect
the rf b(B), rf b(C1),
rf b(C2), and rf b(D) genetic markers. A ratio of 50%
of the tested samples was positive in PCR performed
with rf b(D) primer,
indicating the presence of S.
paratyphi A, serogroup A, in the contaminated food.
The negative results showed by the rest of the tested
strains could be attributed to the high number of
Salmonella species that we did not test for or due to
the existence of unknown mutations in the rf b genes
that might interfere with the detection method.

As for E. coli serotyping,

the results showed
different gene profiles of the isolated strains. Sev-
enty-five percent of the tested strains were stx1-
positive. However, most of those were lacking the H7
flagellar protein gene as tested by PCR amplification
of the f liC operon. Such H7-negative strains have
recently been identified in Germany, Czech Republic,
and Poland, and it was demonstrated that
they
represent a distinct clone within the E. coli O157
serogroup. However,
it shares several virulence
characteristics with other STX-EC of the O157:H7
serotype (Bielaszewska et al., 1998, 2000; Ammon et
al., 1999; Osek and Gallein, 2002). Moreover, only
one strain was positive in PCR performed with eaeA
primers, and none of the tested strains were ehlyA
positive.

Considering the significant

rise in the annual
consumption of antimicrobials as a medication or its
use in various products, it is extremely important to
document
the level of antimicrobial resistance of
bacteria isolated from different foods for the public
health safety. Our findings clearly indicated that two-
third of the tested bacteria, both for E. coli and
to more than five
Salmonella spp., were resistant
antimicrobials.
to previously reported
results (Araj and Zaatari, 2002 medical report by the
American University of Beirut Medical Center) that
showed 100% susceptibility of clinical Salmonella

In contrast

A 30% reduction frequency was observed in
Salmonella spp. susceptibility patterns to Cefotaxime,
as compared to the previously mentioned report. E.
coli on the other hand showed a reduction of more
than 40% in susceptibility to Cefuroxime, where it
showed 100% susceptibility in the clinical isolates
(Araj and Zaatari, 2002) compared to 55.6% in our
isolates. The three previously mentioned antimicro-
bials are commonly used for the treatment of bacterial
infections in Lebanon (Araj and Zaatari, 2002), which
may explain the difference in the susceptibility
patterns between the clinical and food isolates. The
high percentage of Erythromycin and Oxacillin
resistances also refers to the frequent use of these
antimicrobials for treatment of infectious diseases in
Lebanon. Such resistance may not only be a direct
concern to human health, but also, it is important
because it could be transferred to other important
pathogenic serotypes (Dzidic and Bedekovic, 2003).
Interestingly, both organisms showed a similar
resistance profile where the only difference was
observed in the resistance patterns to Gentamicin.
This result indicates a high possibility of horizontal
gene transfer between bacteria, via plasmids or
transposons, and therefore contributing in the increase
of the resistant genes in the environment (Kruse and
Sbrum, 1994).

transfer of

Transfer of plasmid-encoded resistance to anti-
microbial agents is a significant public health
concern. The possibility of
resistance
genes between bacteria in natural habitats has
recently attracted a lot of attention. Within this
framework, we evaluated the association of plasmid
existence with antimicrobial resistance in the isolated
strains. Both E. coli and Salmonella spp. harbored
the same size of plasmid that exceeds 15 kbp in size.
Plasmids with Neomycin and Naladixic acid were
most
few were
with ampicillin, and none were transformed with
Tetracycline or Chloramphenicol. Interestingly, plas-
mids that conferred ampicillin resistance were all
isolated from Salmonella species. Such results
cannot give a clear-cut picture on whether the two
bacteria are carrying the same kind of plasmid or not
due to the differential expression of antimicrobial
resistance by plasmids isolated from both bacteria.

Several antimicrobials earlier used as growth
promoters have been banned in several countries. In
Lebanon,
the usage of antimicrobials is not well
controlled. In our study, we presented some data for
antimicrobial
resistance patterns of E. coli and
Salmonella spp. in two kinds of fast food in Lebanon.
Obviously, the controlled use of antimicrobial agents
is a prerequisite to limit
the emergence of drug-
resistant bacteria, but such prudence in itself is not
enough to control the emerging public health concern.
Additional
research is certainly needed to better
understand the mechanisms behind bacterial resist-
ance to antimicrobials and the underlying mechanisms
such as the transfer of genetic material between
bacteria in the environment.

Finally, the data obtained indicated that meat-based
fast foods in Lebanon, especially Shawarma, are
potential reservoir for many pathogenic organisms,
which were shown to be resistant to many antimicro-
bials, suggesting a potential public health hazard.
Improper hygienic standards and the indiscriminate
use of antimicrobials are the main reasons behind the
emergence of antimicrobial-resistant strains in Leb-
anon. These results will emphasize the need to
implement proactive measures, and more emphasis
will be placed on the application of hygienic practices
and the use of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control
Point (HACCP) in the preparation and processing of
foods to reduce the risk of infection.
