Objectives:  This  study  screened  chickens  and  pigs  slaughtered  for  human  consumption  for  the  presence
Œ≤-lactamase  (ESBL)-  and  plasmid-encoded  AmpC  (pAmpC)
and  characteristics  of  extended-spectrum 
Œ≤-lactamase-producing  enteric  bacteria.
Methods:  Faecal  samples  from  410  broiler  chickens  and  100  pigs  were  cultured  on  MacConkey  agar
mg/mL  cefotaxime.  Antimicrobial  resistance  phenotypes  of  the  recovered  isolates
supplemented  with  2 
were  determined  by  disk  diffusion.  PCR  and  sequencing  were  performed  to  identify  the  ESBL  and  pAmpC
gene  variants  and  other  associated  resistance  determinants.  Genetic  diversity  of  the  isolates  was  analysed
by  phylotyping  and  multilocus  sequence  typing.
Results:  ESBL-producing  Escherichia  coli,  Klebsiella  pneumoniae,  Enterobacter  asburiae  and  Providencia  spp.
were  isolated  from  17  (4.1%)  and  2  (2.0%)  of  the  samples  from  chickens  and  pigs,  respectively.  One
pAmpC-producing  E.  coli  isolate  was  obtained  from  a  chicken.  Resistance  to  tetracycline,  trimethoprim/
sulfamethoxazole,  chloramphenicol  and  gentamicin  was  exhibited  by  95%,  80%,  60%  and  55%  of  the  ESBL/
pAmpC-producing  strains,  respectively.  tet(A)  and  aac(3)-II  were  the  predominant  genes  detected  in
tetracycline-  and  aminoglycoside-resistant  strains,  respectively.  blaCTX-M,  encoding  CTX-M-15  (15
isolates)  or  CTX-M-1  variants  (3  isolates),  was  present  in  all  but  one  ESBL-producer,  either  alone  or  in
combination  with  blaSHV and/or  blaTEM.  The  remaining  ESBL-producer,  a  Providencia  spp.  recovered  from  a
chicken,  harboured  blaVEB.  The  only  pAmpC-positive  E.  coli  strain  carried  blaCMY-2.  The  11  ESBL-producing
E.  coli  strains  belonged  to 
Conclusions:  Healthy  chickens  and  pigs  act  as  reservoirs  of  ESBL/pAmpC-producing  enterobacteria  that
can  potentially  be  transmitted  to  humans  through  direct  contact  or  ingestion  of  contaminated  meat.

1.  Introduction

Antimicrobial  resistance 

is  a  growing  public-health  threat
worldwide,  and  members  of  the  Enterobacteriaceae  family  are
among  the  clinically  important  bacteria  that  are  rapidly  developing
resistance  to  available  antibacterial  agents.  The  most  important
mechanism  of  resistance 
to  third-generation  cephalosporins

$ Part  of  this  study  was  presented  at  the  25th  European  Congress  of  Clinical
Microbiology  and  Infectious  Diseases  (ECCMID),  25‚Äì28  April  2015,  Copenhagen,
Denmark  [EV0160].

Œ≤-lactam  ring  of  extended-spectrum 

among  members  of  the  Enterobacteriaceae,  particularly  Escherichia
coli  and  Klebsiella  pneumoniae,  is  the  production  of  extended-
Œ≤-lactamase  (ESBL)  enzymes  [1,2].  These  enzymes
spectrum 
Œ≤-lactam
hydrolyse  the 
antibacterial  agents  (cephalosporins  and  monobactams).  ESBL-
producing  bacteria  pose  a  serious  therapeutic  challenge  as  they  are
frequently  resistant  to  other  classes  of  antimicrobial  agents  such  as
Ô¨Çuoroquinolones,  aminoglycosides  and  trimethoprim/sulfameth-
oxazole  (SXT)  [3].

Three  major  families  of  ESBL  enzymes  have  been  reported,
namely  TEM,  SHV  and  CTX-M  types  [4].  The  TEM-  and  SHV-type
ESBLs  arise  by  point  mutations  leading  to  substitutions  of  key
amino  acid  residues  in  the  classical  TEM-1/TEM-2  and  SHV-1

Œ≤-lactamases  [1,2].  These  ESBL  types  predominated  in  the  1980s
Œ≤-lactamase-produc-
and  1990s.  However,  the 
ing  cefotaxime-resistant  E.  coli  was 
isolated  from  the  faecal
microbiota  of  a  laboratory  dog  in  Japan  in  1986  [5].  The  enzyme
responsible  for  the  cefotaxime  resistance  was  designated  FEC-1
and  was  later  found  to  be  related  to  CTX-M-3  type  [6].  The  CTX-M-
type  ESBLs  have  now  emerged  as  the  dominant  types  [1]  and  are
increasingly  being  detected  both  in  human  and  animal  populations
in  many  parts  of  the  world  [7,8].  On  the  basis  of  amino  acid
sequence, 
Ô¨Åve  groups  or  clusters  of  CTX-M-type  ESBLs  have  been
identiÔ¨Åed,  namely  CTX-M-1,  -2,  -8,  -9  and  -25  [2].  Healthy  food
animals  are  increasingly  being  reported  as  reservoirs  of  ESBL-
producing  enteric  bacteria  [7,9].

In  Nigeria,  most  of 

the  available  reports  on  molecular
characterisation  of  ESBL  genes  are  on  human  isolates  [10,11],  with
scant  information  on  animal  isolates  [12,13].  The  objective  of  this
study  was  to  screen  broiler  chickens  and  pigs  slaughtered  for
human  consumption  at  Ikpa  market  in  Nsukka  (Nigeria)  for  ESBL-
producing  enteric  bacteria  and  to  characterise  the  recovered
isolates.

for  18‚Äì24  h.  One 

Faecal  swab  samples  were  collected  from  410  broiler  chickens
(210  samples  between  April‚ÄìJune  2014  and  200  samples  between
September‚ÄìNovember  2015)  and  100  pigs  (September‚ÄìNovem-
ber  2015)  presented  for  slaughter  at  Ikpa  market/slaughterhouse.
Samples  were  collected  once  a  week  during  the  sampling  period,
and  not  more  than  20  chickens  and  10  pigs  were  sampled  at  each
visit;  each  sampled  animal  came  from  a  different  farm  or  owner.
Swab  samples  were  obtained  from  the  cloaca  and  rectum  of
chickens  and  pigs,  respectively,  just  before  slaughter.  Each  swab
sample  was  placed  into  a  sterile  tube,  was  transported  to  the
laboratory  and  was  processed  within  2  h  of  collection.  Samples
mg/mL
were  inoculated  on  MacConkey  agar  supplemented  with  2 
cefotaxime  (CMCA)  plates  and  inoculated  plates  were  incubated
at  37 C 
representative  colony  of  each
morphological  type  from  the  CMCA  plate  was  picked  and  was
subcultured  on  MacConkey  agar  to  obtain  a  pure  culture.  The  pure
cultures  colonies  were  screened  for  ESBL  production  using  the

test  isolate  producing  an  inhibition  zone  diameter  difference  of
5  mm  between  the  combination  disk  and  the  cefpodoxime  disk

isolates  were  considered  as  presumptive  AmpC-producers.  The
ESBL-  and  presumptive  AmpC-producers  were  subcultured  on
brain‚Äìheart  infusion  agar,  were  incubated  overnight  at  37 C  and
were  processed  for  species  identiÔ¨Åcation  using  matrix-assisted
laser  desorption/ionisation  time-of-Ô¨Çight  mass  spectrometry
(MALDI-TOF/MS) 
rRNA  sequencing.  Bacterial
genomic  DNA  was  extracted  using  an  InstaGeneTM Matrix  Kit
(Bio-Rad,  Hercules,  CA)  and  the  PCR  assay  was  performed  using
previously  described  primers  (uni16-F,  AGAGTTTGATYMTGGCT-
CAG;  and  uni16-R,  GGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT)  [16,17].  For  further
molecular  analysis,  we  only 
focused  on  bacteria  producing
Œ≤-lactamases,  i.e.  ESBLs  and  plasmid-encoded  AmpC
acquired 
Œ≤-lactamases.  Chromosomally-encoded  AmpC

2.3.  Detection  of  extended-spectrum 
encoding  genes  and  other  antimicrobial  resistance  genes

Œ≤-lactamase-  and  plasmid  AmpC-

ESBL-producing  bacteria  were  screened  for  the  presence  of
Œ≤-lactamases
genes  encoding  TEM-,  SHV-,  OXA-1-  and  CTX-M-type 
by  PCR  using  speciÔ¨Åc  primers  and  conditions  reported  previously
[9].  Detection  of  acquired  ampC  genes  among  presumptive  AmpC-
producing  isolates  was  done  using  a  multiplex  PCR  assay  [19].
Absence  of  the  classic  ESBL  genes  in  an  isolate  prompted  the  search
for  minor  ESBL  families  such  as  VEB  [20].  The  amplicons  obtained
were  sequenced  and  the  sequences  were  compared  with  those  in
the  GenBank  and  Lahey  Clinic  (http://www.lahey.org/Studies/)

2.4.  Multilocus  sequence  typing  (MLST)  and  phylotyping  of  extended-

Escherichia  coli  strains

Œ≤-lactamase-  and  plasmid-encoded  AmpC-producing

To  identify  the  genetic  lineages  of  the  ESBL-  and  pAmpC-
producing  E.  coli  strains,  DNA  sequencing  of  the  internal  fragments
of  seven  housekeeping  genes  (adk,  fumC,  gyrB,  icd,  mdh,  purA  and
recA)  was  performed.  The  allelic  proÔ¨Åle  of  each  strain  was
determined  and  the  sequence  type  (ST)  was  assigned  in  accordance
with  the  E.  coli  MSLT  website  (http://mlst.ucc.ie/mlst/dbs/Ecoli).
The  E.  coli  strains  were  classiÔ¨Åed  into  one  of  the  seven  major
phylogenetic  groups  (A,  B1,  B2,  C,  D,  E  and  F)  using  the  quadruplex
PCR  method  proposed  by  Clermont  et  al.  [22].

3.  Results  and  discussion

3.1.  Extended-spectrum 
producing  enteric  bacterial  species  isolated

Œ≤-lactamase-  and  plasmid-encoded  AmpC-

Samples  from  18  (4.4%)  of  the  410  broiler  chickens  and  2  (2.0%)
of  the  100  pigs  yielded  growth  on  CMCA  plates.  Of  the  20  isolates
recovered  on  CMCA,  19  were  phenotypically  conÔ¨Årmed  as  ESBL-
producers  by  the  combination  disk  method  using  cefpodoxime/
clavulanic  acid  and  cefpodoxime  disks.  The  remaining  isolate  was
resistant  to  cefoxitin  and  was  therefore  a  presumptive  AmpC-
producer.  The  isolates  recovered  on  CMCA  were  identiÔ¨Åed  into  four
species,  namely  E.  coli  (11  strains),  K.  pneumoniae  (7  strains),
Enterobacter  asburiae  (1  strain)  and  Providencia  spp.  (1  strain)
(Table  1).  Ten  of  the  E.  coli,  all  seven  K.  pneumoniae  and  the  single  E.
asburiae  and  Providencia  spp.  strains  were  ESBL-producers,  whilst
one  E.  coli  strain  was  a  pAmpC-producer.  Among  the  genera  of  the
family  Enterobacteriaceae,  ESBL  production 
is  predominantly
found  in  E.  coli  and  Klebsiella  spp.  [2].

3.2.  Resistance  phenotypes  of  the  extended-spectrum 
and  plasmid-encoded  AmpC-producing  Enterobacteriaceae

Œ≤-lactamase-

The  resistance  phenotypes  of  the  ESBL-  and  pAmpC-producing
strains  to  the  antimicrobial  agents  tested  are  presented  in  Table  1.
All  of  the  bacterial  strains  studied  were  resistant  to  ceftazidime
and  cefotaxime;  one  strain  was  resistant  to  cefoxitin.  Resistance
to 
tetracycline,  SXT,  chloramphenicol  and  gentamicin  was
exhibited  by  19  (95%),  16  (80%),  12  (60%)  and  11  (55%)  of  the
ESBL-producing  strains,  respectively.  Moreover,  19  of  the  isolates
were  resistant  to  at  least  three  classes  of  antimicrobial  agents
tested,  with  8  (40%)  of  them  were  resistant  to  9  or  more  of  the  13
antimicrobial  agents  used.  Extensive  use  of  antimicrobial  agents,
Œ≤-lactams  and  tetracyclines,  in  poultry  production  in
particularly 
Nigeria 
the  emergence  of
multidrug-resistant  (MDR)  enteric  bacteria.  Moreover,  the  high
resistance  rates  recorded  in  this  study  are  in  accordance  with  data
reported  in  food  animals  by  other  authors  both  from  Africa  and
Europe  [25‚Äì27].  The  level  of  use  of  speciÔ¨Åc  antimicrobial  agents
was  found  to  be  strongly  correlated  with  the  level  of  resistance  to
these  agents  in  commensal  E.  coli  isolates  from  cattle,  pigs  and
poultry  [26].

3.3.  Molecular  characterisation  of  extended-spectrum 
and  plasmid  AmpC-encoding  genes  and  other  antimicrobial  resistance
genes

PCR  screening  of  the  19  phenotypically  conÔ¨Årmed  ESBL-produc-
ing  isolates  for  blaCTX,  blaTEM and  blaSHV genes  showed  that  blaCTX-M
was  present  in  all  but  one  ESBL-producer,  either  alone  (10  isolates)
or  in  combination  with  blaSHV (4  isolates),  blaTEM (2  isolates)  or
blaSHV +  blaTEM (2  isolates)  (Table  1).  The  remaining  ESBL-producer,
a  Providencia  spp.  isolate,  harboured  a  minor  ESBL  gene  (blaVEB).
Thus,  ESBL-producing  enteric  bacteria  were  isolated  from  17  (4.1%)
of  the  410  chicken samples  and  2  (2.0%)  and  the  100  pig  samples. The
higher  rate  of  ESBL-producing  isolates  among  broiler  chickens  is  in
accordance  with  data  reported  from  Tunisia  [27]. 
Ibadan
(Nigeria),  ESBL-producing  E.  coli  was  detected  in  one  of  the  faecal
samples  collected  from  100  chickens  at  slaughter,  whilst  none  of  the
100  samples  from  pigs  were  positive  [28].  The  variability  in  the  rate
of  detection  of  ESBL-producing  enteric  bacteria  may  be  explained  in
part  by  differences  in  the  methodology  used.  This  can  also  be
partially  explained  by  the  fact  that  antibiotic  usage  is  growing  in
intensive  farming,  more  common  in  poultry  where  animals  are
reared  in  close  proximity  [7].

DNA  sequencing  of  the  blaCTX genes  revealed  two  CTX-M  types

CTX-M-type  ESBL,  detected  in  15  of  the  19  ESBL-positive  isolates  in
this  study.  Thus,  irrespective  of  the  source  of  the  sample,  CTX-M-15
was  the  predominant  CTX-M  type  reported  among  members  of  the
Enterobacteriaceae 
in  Nigeria.  CTX-M-15  and  CTX-M-1  (both
belonging  to  CTX-M-1  cluster)  detected  in  this  study  are  among

Œ≤-lactamase-  and  plasmid-encoded  AmpC-producing

The  11  ESBL-  and  pAmpC-producing  E.  coli  strains  analysed
belonged  to 
Ô¨Åve  sequence  types,  namely  ST226  (4  strains),  ST3625
(3  strains),  ST10  (2  strains),  ST46  (1  strain)  and  ST58  (1  strain),  with
ST3625  being  reported  for  the 
Ô¨Årst  time  in  this  study.  The  three
strains  with  this  new  sequence  type  were  isolated  from  broiler
chickens  and 
they  all  had  a  similar  resistance  phenotype,
harboured  the  blaCTX-M-1 gene  and  belonged  to  phylogroup  B1.
Apart  from  the  CMY-2-producing  E.  coli  strain  that  belonged  to
phylogroup  B1  as  well  as  the  three  ST3625  strains  mentioned
above,  all  of  the  other  strains  studied  belonged  to  phylogroup  A
(Table  1).  Thus, 
the  ESBL-producing  E.  coli  strains  studied
predominantly  belonged 
(7/11).  All  seven
phylogroup  A  strains  were  CTX-M-15-type  ESBL-producers  and
were  distributed  among  three  sequence  types.  The  E.  coli  strains  in
the  current  study  essentially  belonged

out  [36],  this  may  be  due  to  the  fact  that  all  were  recovered  from
faecal  samples.  The  results  of  phylogenetic  grouping  and  MLST
indicated  that  the  ESBL-producing  E.  coli  from  chickens  and  pigs  in
the  study  area  belonged  to  diverse  genetic  lineages.  Although

clones  such  as  ST405-D  and  ST38-D,  the  strains  from  livestock
origin  involved  in  the  present  study  belonged  to  phylogroups  A  and
B1.  However,  the  E.  coli  ST10-A  clone  detected  in  two  broiler

clone  widely  spread  both  in  humans  and  animals  in  relation  to  the
production  of  CMY-2  and  CTX-M-1  group  enzymes  [34,39,41].  The
results  of  this  study,  as  well  as  those  of  previous  studies,  show  the
association  between  speciÔ¨Åc  clones  and  ESBL/pAmpC  genetic

MDR  ESBL-  and  pAmpC-producing  members  of  the  Enter-
obacteriaceae  family  are  present  in  chickens  and  pigs  slaughtered
for  human  consumption  in  Nsukka,  Nigeria.  The  predominant  ESBL
gene  type  in  this  study  was  blaCTX-M-15,  and  three  of  the  E.  coli
Œ≤-
isolates  belonged  to  a  new  sequence  type  (ST3625).  The  pAmpC 
lactamase  CMY-2  and  the  minor  ESBL  type  VEB  are  reported  here
for  the 
in  Nigeria  and  Africa,
respectively.  Healthy  chickens  and  pigs  may  act  as  reservoirs  of
ESBL/pAmpC-producing  enterobacteria  isolates  that  can  be  poten-
tially  transmitted  to  humans  through  direct  contact  or  ingestion  of
derived  contaminated  meat.  Association  of  members  of  the
Enterobacteriaceae 
food-producing  animals  with
genes  encoding  antimicrobial  resistance  constitutes  a  serious
public-health  concern.
