The  present  study  assessed  the  antibiotic  susceptibility  patterns  of  Escherichia  coli  and  Salmonella 
isolates of raw milk from zero grazed cows. A total of 65 milk  samples were collected for analysis. The 
standard membrane filtration technique and HiCrome E. coli agar were used in isolation of E. coli from 
milk  samples.  Isolation  of  Salmonella  species  employed  pre-enrichment  in  buffered  peptone  water 
followed by enrichment in Rappaport and Vassilidis broth prior to Xylose lysine deoxychocolate agar as 
a differential  media. The isolates were analyzed for antimicrobial susceptibility to  eight different types 
of antibiotics using disc diffusion method. The prevalence of E. coli was 16 (16.7%) and all the samples 
tested were negative for Salmonella. The average colony forming unit for E. coli was 2cfu/mL. All E. coli 
isolates tested were resistant to penicillin (100%) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (100%) while 15(93.8%) 
were  sensitive  to  ciprofloxacin.  Resistance  was  also  observed  in  sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim 
(43.8%), chloramphenicol (12.5%), oxytetracycline (68.8%), streptomycin (12.5%) and gentamicin (25%). 
Of the isolates tested, 14 (87.5%) showed multi-drug resistance pattern. These results confirm that milk 
from  zero  grazed  cows  in  Arusha  was  contaminated  with  E.  coli,  and  that  most  of  the  E.  coli  strains 
isolated were resistant to at least one of the antimicrobial agent commonly used in treatment of human 
diseases. 
 
INTRODUCTION  
 
Milk is considered virtually  sterile when secreted into the 
alveoli  of  the  udder,  however;  thereafter  it  may  be 
contaminated in the interior or exterior of the udder. While

the  food  value  chain  (Abate  et  al.,  2015).  Cow’s  milk, 
being  nutritious  with  high  water  activity,  serves  as  the 
best  medium  for  most  of  microorganisms  including 
pathogenic  bacteria such as  E. coli  and Salmonella, that 
pose threats to human health (Kanyeka, 2014). 

Listeria  monocytogenes,  Brucella 

Although  Salmonella,  Staphyloccocus  aureus  and  E. 
coli  O157:H7  are  the  bacteria  that  can  be  shed  through 
milk  (Ogilvie,  1986;  Fagundes  et  al.,  2012),  Coxiella 
burnetii, 
spp, 
Campylobacter  jejuni,  Mycobacterium  avium  subspecies 
paratuberculosis,  Bacillus 
cereus,  Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis,  Mycobacterium  bovis  and  Yersinia 
enterocolitica  are  the  bacteria  commonly  contaminating 
milk  (Dhanashekar,  2012).  A  study  by  Lubote  et  al., 
(2014), in Tanzania reported that milk quality deteriorated 
along  the  food  value  chain;  whereby    high  prevalence 
rate  of  Salmonella  and  E.  coli  were  found  in  vendors 
(43.8%) and 8.0 x 103 cfu/mL, shops (40%) and 6.6 x 103 
cfu/mL  and  from  producers  (33.3%)  and  3.0  x  103 
respectively.  Microorganisms 
from  animal 
products  such  as  raw  or  unpasteurized  milk  and  meat 
have 
long  been  considered  as  sources  of  human 
infections, where salmonellosis has been reported as one 
of  the  common  food-borne  infections  globally  (Addis  et 
al.,  2011).  Salmonella  of  zoonotic  origin  has  been 
reported  to  show  increasing  rates  of  resistance  to 
multiple  antibiotics  (Mijović,  2012).  Such  resistance  is 
acquired  while  in  the host  animal  it  is  spread  to  humans 
through  the  food  chain  (Carattoli,  2003;  Sisak  et  al., 
2006;  Kidie  et  al.,  2013).  Although  E.  coli  is  an  enteric 
commensal  bacterium  in  both  animals  and  humans, 
pathogenic  strains  exist  and  cause  different  diseases 
including  urinary 
infections,  gastroenteritis, 
septicemia,  meningitis  and  peritonitis  (Tadesse  et  al., 
2012). 

isolated 

tract 

The  increasing  use  of  antibiotics  in  veterinary  practice 
is  suspected  to  contribute  to  acceleration  of  antibiotic 
resistance  in  microorganisms  found  where  livestock  are 
kept  (Addis  et  al.,  2011).  The  irrational  use  of  antibiotics 
in  food  producing  animals  could  result  into  antibiotic 
residues  in  edible  tissues  and  products  (Darwish  et  al., 
2013).  It  has  been  reported  that,  antibiotics  used  for 
treatment  of  human  bacterial  infections  are  used  for 
prophylactic, 
in 
animals  too  (Phillips  et  al.,  2004).  Bacteria  that  have 
been exposed to low doses of these antibiotics in tissues 
and products from these animals may be less susceptible 
to drugs,  and  when such bacteria enter  the  human  body 
through  consumption  of  contaminated  foods,  they  may 
cause  infections  that  are  resistant  to  many  antibiotics 
(Wang et al., 2011; Clauβen et al., 2013). 

therapeutic  and  growth  promotion 

A  study  conducted  in  Kilosa  and  Mvomero  districts  in 
reported 
Morogoro,  Tanzania  by  Kanyeka, 
antibiotic  resistance  in  bacteria  isolated  from  milking 
containers  and  milk  products.  Example  E.  coli  was 
reported  to  be  resistant  to  amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid 
(100%),  ampicillin  (100%)  and  amoxicillin  (100%)  and 

(2014) 

the 

and 

ascertaining 

 
 
 
Salmonella  showed  resistance  to  ampicillin  (100%)  and 
amoxicillin  (100%).  Lubote  et  al.  (2014)  reported  that, 
milk may contain resistant  bacterial strains as  a result of 
cross  contamination  from  containers,  humans  and  the 
environment. Due to urbanization  and  limited  diversity  of 
pasture,  reliance  on  processed  commercial  feed  mainly 
cereal  and  oil  seed  by-products,  zero  grazed  cows  are 
prone to diseases and prominent use of antibiotics (Shem 
et al., 2002; Mathews Jr and Johnson, 2013). To this fact, 
little  is  known  about  antimicrobial  resistance  of  bacteria 
that are shed by the zero grazed cows in the study area. 
Therefore,  the  present  study  aimed  at  establishing  the 
prevalence 
antimicrobial 
susceptibility  pattern  of  E.  coli  and  Salmonella  isolated 
from  raw  milk  from  zero  grazed  cows  in  ten  wards  of 
Arusha city, Tanzania. 
 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
  
Study site 
 
The  study  was  purposively  conducted  in  ten  wards  (Sombetini, 
Baraa,  Engutoto,  Moshono,  Moivaro,  Kimandolu,  Sinoni,  Lemara, 
Daraja  II  and  Themi)  of  the  Arusha  City  where  some  of  the 
residents  practice  dairy  cattle  keeping  as  a  common  economic 
activity (Bukuku, 2013). The Arusha City, which is the headquarter 
of  the  Arusha  region  is  situated  in  the  north-eastern  corner  of 
Tanzania, between latitudes 2° and 6° South and longitudes 35° and 
38° East of the Greenwich (Thadeo, 2014).   
 
 
Sample collection 
 
The sample size was determined using the prevalence rate of 90% 
from  the  previous  study  by  Lubote  et  al.  (2014)  and  the  formula 
used by Addis et al., (2011) which is; 
 

 

 
Where;  N  is  the  required  sample  size,  Zα,  the  normal  deviation  at 
5% which is 1.96, P, the estimated prevalence which is 90% and d2, 
the  precision  of  estimate  considered  as  0.05.  According  to  the 
formula, a total of 66 samples should be used in the study. Only 65 
samples were analysed for the study as one of the farmer dropped 
out in the last period of sample collection. 

The  studied  households  were  selected  randomly  from  the  list  of 
dairy  keeping  households  available  at  the  Ward  Livestock  Offices. 
From  each  household,  milk  samples  were  collected  from  only  one 
milked cow  that  received  medication  later  than  others  and  that the 
withdraw  period  for  any  disease  treated  was  over  and  seemed 
apparently  health.  A  total  of  65  milk  samples  each  from  a  single 
cow  were  collected  from  all  the  teats  on  the  udder  of  the  selected 
animals.  The  milk  samples  were  collected  during  the  milking  time 
between  17:00  and  19:00h.  The  udders  and  teats  of  the  selected 
cows  were  washed  thoroughly  with  warm  water  and  then  dried  by 
using  towels,  then,  the  fore  stream  of  milk  was  directed  to  the 
household  milking  container  so  as  to  clean  the  orifice  hence 
prevent  contamination  by  environmental  bacteria.  Thereafter,  a 
stream of milk was directed to the sterile falcon tubes while avoiding 
the  contact  between  the  sampling  container,  cow’s  teats  and  the 
milker’s  hands  so  to  prevent  contamination  of  the  samples  by 
environmental bacteria. The milk samples were kept in a cool box at  

N= (Zα/2)2×P(1−P)/d2;  1946          Afr. J. Microbiol. Res. 
 
 
 
about 4°C so as to avoid bacterial proliferation. The samples were 
immediately transported to the Nelson Mandela African Institution of 
Science and Technology (NM-AIST) laboratory for bacterial culture 
within five hours (Lubote et al, 2014). All media used in isolation of 
bacteria were from HiMedia  Laboratories Pvt. LTD, Mumbai, India, 
were  of  analytical  grade  and  used  according  to  manufacturer’s 
instructions.  
 
 
Isolation of E. coli  
 
The  standard  membrane  filtration  technique  and  HiCrome  E.  coli 
agar  were  used  in  isolation  of  E.  coli  from  milk  samples.  The 
procedure  was  carried  as  described  by  Robinson  and  Batt  (1999) 
and  Lyimo  et  al.  (2016).  Briefly,  10ml  of  milk  sample  was  diluted 
into 90ml of double distilled sterile water. Then, 100ml of the diluted 
sample  was  filtered  through  a  47mm  membrane  filters  (cellulose 
nitrate  filters)  with  pore  size  of  0.45µm  (Sartorius  Stedium  Biotech 
GmbH,  Goettingen)  in  a  vacuum  filtration  system.  After  filtration, 
each filter membrane was placed on a chromogenic selective agar 
plate (HiCrome E. coli agar) and then pre-incubated at 37°C for 4h 
so  as  to  resuscitate  the  injured  or  stressed  bacteria,  followed  by 
incubation  for  22h  at  44°C.    E. coli  were  picked,  preserved  in 15% 
glycerol:  85%  Lysogeny  broth  (LB)  and  stored  at  -80ºC  for 
subsequent analysis. 
 
 
Isolation of Salmonella  
 
Isolation of Salmonella was carried out according to the procedures 
described by Addis et al. (2011). Briefly, 1.0ml of milk sample was 
pre-enriched  with  9.0  ml  of  buffered  peptone  water  (BPW)  for  24h 
at 37°C. Then, 0.4ml of the non-selective pre-enrichment step was 
transferred  to  10  ml  of  Rappaport  and  Vassilidis  broth  (RVS)  and 
then  incubated  at  42°C  for  24h.  Then,  a  loopful  (1µl)  of  cultured 
broth  from  the  selective  enrichment  step  were  streaked  onto 
Xylose-Lysine  Deoxycholate  agar  (XLD)  plates  using  a  sterile  wire 
loop and then incubated at 37°C for 24h. For samples that did not 
show any growth during 24h, incubation was extended to 48h.  
 
 
Colony forming units  
 
The  colony  forming  unit  per  millilitre  (Cfu/ml)  was  calculated  using 
the formula;  
Number  of  colonies  *dilution  factor  /volume  plated  (Baranzoni, 
2014).  
 
 
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing  
 
Sensitivity  toward  eight  different  antibacterial  agents  (streptomycin 
300  µg,  penicillin  10  µg,  tetracycline  10  µg,  sulfamethaxazole-
trimethoprim  25  µg,  oxytetracycline  30  µg,  gentamicin  10  µg  and 
amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid  3  µg)  commonly  used    for  disease 
treatment  in  both  humans  and  animals,  ciprofloxacin  5µg  and 
chloramphenicol 10µg which are drugs reserved for human disease 
treatment  was  carried  out.  The  procedure  described  by  Lalitha 
(2004)  was  used.  In  brief,  E.  coli  cells  were  resuscitated  through 
incubation  on  nutrient  broth  (Liofilchem  Bacteriology  Products, 
Roseto)  at  37°C  for  24  h.  The  turbidity  was  adjusted  against  0.5 
Macfarland  concentrations  (Remel,  Lenexa  Kansas)  by  adding  the 
E.  coli culture  into sterile  normal  saline  0.85%  (VWR  International, 
West Chester).  

Then,  sterile  swab  was  used  to  spread  the  E.  coli  cells  on  the 
entire  surface  of the  petri  dishes that  contained  Tryptone  soy  agar 
(Oxoid 
ltd  Basingstoke,  Hampshire).  Antibiotic  discs  were 
aseptically  placed  on  top  of  the  swabbed petri  dishes  and   the

antibiotics  were  allowed  to  diffuse  at  24°C  for  15  min  followed  by 
incubation at 37°C for 24 h. The zones of inhibition were measured 
by  using  a  vernier  calliper  into  the  nearest  millimetres  in  order  to 
establish  the  susceptibility  profile  of  E.  coli.  The  susceptibility 
pattern  was  classified  as  resistant,  intermediate  or  susceptible 
according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Isolation of E. coli and Salmonella  
 
The  present  study  aimed  at  assessing  the  prevalence 
and  antibiotic  susceptibility  profile  of  E.  coli  and 
Salmonella isolates of  zero-grazed cows’ milk. Out of  65 
samples,  only  7(11%)  were  positive  for  E.  coli  and 
Salmonella  was  not  detected  in  any  of  the  samples 
tested.  The  highest  number  of  E.  coli  colonies  in  E.  coli 
positive  samples  was  four,  thus  the  average  prevalence 
rate  of  E.  coli  in  the  present  study  was  16  (16.7%).  The 
lowest  prevalence  rate  of  116  (12.9%)  E.  coli  has  also 
been reported by Worku et al, (2012) in Oromia Regional 
State.  Another  study  by  Ekici,  et  al.,  (2004)  in  Turkey 
reported  that  neither  Salmonella  nor  E.  coli  was  isolated 
in  all  milk  samples  collected  from  individual  cows  while 
the  study  by  Reta  et  al.  (2016)  at  Jigjiga  City  of  Somali 
Regional  State  reported  a  higher  prevalence  of  9  (30%) 
E. coli and 1 (3.3%) Salmonella isolates. The differences 
in  prevalence  rate  of  E.  coli  and  Salmonella  may  be 
attributed  to  the  health  status  of  cows  whose  milk  was 
sampled. In this study, milk samples were collected from 
apparently  healthy  animals  and  may  explain  for  the  low 
prevalence  rates  observed.  The  average  colony  forming 
unit  for  E.  coli  was  2  cfu/ml.  This  indicates  that,  E.  coli 
load  in  all  milk  samples  were  low  compared  to  the 
previous literature by Marth and Steele (2001); that cows 
can shed E. coli up to 108  cfu/ml. These findings  implies 
that,  raw  milk  in  the  study  area  had  low  initial  bacterial 
count,  probably  because  milk  samples  were  collected 
from  animals  that  were  considered  apparently  healthy, 
this  has  also  been  previously  observed  by  Tamime 
(2009). 

The absence of Salmonella in all samples is supported 
by  the  previous  reports  that,  Salmonella  could  be  shed 
through milk only when the animal is suffering from acute 
clinical salmonellosis and sometimes  by  carrier  animals

(Wood  et  al.,  1991;  McGuirk  and  Peek,  2003). 
Furthermore, the absence of Salmonella in milk suggests 
that  milk  is  free from  bacteria in the interior  of  the  udder 
only if the animal is healthy (Murphy and Boor, 2000).  
It has also been reported in study by  Abate  et al. (2015) 
that, milk is virtually sterile when secreted into the alveoli 
of 
the  udder  and,  after  secretion,  milk  may  be 
contaminated  within  the  udder  if  the  animal  is  sick  or 
outside  the  udder  as  a  result  of  cross  contamination. 
Additionally,  presence  of  E.  coli  in  milk  could  be  due  to 
infection  of the teats by environmental  E. coli or the milk 
was contaminated by E. coli from the environment during 
sampling  or  because  of  faulty  laboratory  procedures 
(Smith et al., 1985; Smith and Hogan, 1993).  

Since milk samples were collected from cows that were 
considered  apparently  healthy,  but  had  the  history  of 
medication,  it  could  be  that,  Salmonella  isolates  were 
more sensitive whereas  E. coli  isolates might have been 
resistant to the administered antimicrobials. On the other 
hand,  Salmonella  and  E.  coli  are  enteric  bacteria  which 
are  found  in  animal’s  intestine  (Sawant  et  al.,  2007; 
Ouseph  et  al.,  2009;  Tadesse  et  al.,  2012)  and  their 
presence  in  milk  could imply  that, the  animal  is  a  carrier 
or  infected  by  such  bacteria  (McGuirk  and  Peek,  2003). 
Table  1  shows  the  diversity  of  E.  coli  and  Salmonella 
isolation  from  milk  samples  collected  from  ten  wards  of 
Arusha City. 
 
 
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing  
 
Among  the  isolates  tested,  56.3%  were  susceptible  to 
chloramphenicol 
sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, 
(37.5%),  penicillin 
(31.3%), 

(0%),  oxytetracycline 

streptomycin  (68.8%),  gentamicin  (12.5%),  ciprofloxacin 
(93.8%)  and  amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid 
(0%).  The 
intermediate  pattern  observed  were  sulfamethoxazole-
trimethoprim  (0%),  chloramphenicol  (50%),  penicillin 
(0%),    oxytetracycline  (0%),  streptomycin    (18.8%), 
gentamicin 
amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid  (0%)  and  resistance  pattern 
observed  were  sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim  (43.8%), 
(100%),

(62.5%),

(25%), 

 

 

Of  the  selected  antibiotics,  E.  coli  were  prevalently 
resistant  to  penicillin  (100%)  and  amoxicillin-clavulanic 
acid  (100%).  The  results  are  similar  to  the  findings  by 
Idriss  et  al.,  (2014)  who  reported  that  96%  of  E.  coli 
isolates  were  resistant  to  amoxicillin-clavulanic  in  Nitra, 
Slovakia. Similarly, Belayneh et al., (2014) reported  that, 
65%  of  the  E.  coli  isolates  were  resistant  to  penicillin  in 
East  Showa  Zone  of  Akaki  District,  Ethiopia.  The 
resistance of E. coli isolates to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 
observed  in  the  present  study  is,  however,  higher  than 
the findings by Čížek et al. (2008) who reported that, 23% 
of  the  isolates  were  resistant  to  amoxicillin-clavulanic 
acid.  The  high  resistance  to  amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid 
and  penicillin  reported  in  the  present  study  could  be 
associated  with  the  lack  of  professionalism  in  dairy 
farming  which  may  contribute  to  misuse  of  these  drugs. 
As observed in the present study, during the onsite visits, 
56.9% of the dairy farmers in Arusha City kept no record 
of  any  health  interventions  made  to  their  animals. 
Moreover,  it  could  be  due  to  self-medication  by  using 
experience,  instructions  from  veterinary  input  shops  or 
instructions  on  the  label  of  the  respective  medicine,  a

treatment  of  the  disease.  Since  in  Tanzania,  antibiotics 
are  sometimes  sold  without  prescriptions  (Van  de 
boogard  et  al.,  2011),  the  observed  resistance  could  be 
due to increased use of antibiotics, especially the first line 
antibiotics  which  are  cheap  and  easily  accessible 
(Shakya  et  al.,  2013).  The  susceptibility  profile  of  E.  coli 
to  different  antibiotics  has  been  summarised  in  Figure  1 
below.

The  study  has  also  revealed  resistance  (12.5%)  and 
intermediate  (60%)  patterns  to  chloramphenicol.  These 
findings are  in contrast to those reported by  Belayneh et 
al. (2014) in East Showa Zone of Akaki District, Ethiopia, 
who 
to 
chloramphenicol. In this study, a lower proportion (12.5%) 
of  the  E.  coli  isolates  were  resistant  to  chloramphenicol 
compared  to  the  high  resistance  rate  (40%)  reported  by 
El-Zubeir  and  El-Owni 
to 
chloramphenicol  reported  in  the  present  study  may  be 
associated  with  indiscriminate  use  of  this  abandoned 
antibiotic. Some studies in Tanzania and Nigeria reported 
that,  chloramphenicol  is  irrationally  used  in  animals  as 
evidenced  by  the  presence  of  its  residues  in  poultry  and 
poultry  products  (Nonga  et  al.,  2010;  Darwish  et  al., 
2013).  However,  it  may  be  due  to  transfer  of  resistant 
genes  as  a  result  of  cross  contamination  between 
humans,  animals  and  the  environment  (Bischoff  et  al., 
2005;Salehi and Bonab, 2006) or use of other antibiotics 
belonging  to  aphenicol  group  (Ruzauskas  et  al.,  2009). 
The  susceptibility  pattern  of  E.  coli  from  all  the  sampling 
sites is summarized in the Table 2.

imply  that  the  drug  is  not  being  used  in  dairy  farming  to 
treat animal diseases. This may be attributed by the fact

Among  the  E.  coli  isolates  tested,  87.5%  were  multi-
drug resistant. Multi-drug resistance pattern of E. coli has 
also  been  reported  by  Haque  (2013)  in  Bangladesh  and 
by  Memon  et  al.  (2012)  in  Eastern  China.  Of  the  multi-
drug  E.  coli  resistant  isolates,  50%  showed  multi-drug 
resistance  to  sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim,  penicillin, 
tetracycline  and  amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid.  The  multi-
drug  resistance  pattern  observed  could  be  the  result  of 
accumulation  of  resistance  genes  in  the  plasmids,  each 
coding for resistance to a specific antibiotic and or multi-
drug  efflux  pump  each  pumping  out  more  than  one 
antibiotic  (Nikaido,  2009).  Development  of  multi-drug 
resistant  bacteria  is  a  threat  to  public  health  because  it 
leads  to  ineffective  treatment  of  infections  and  poor 
recovery  of  the  patients  (Levy  and  Marshall,  2004; 
Magiorakos et al., 2012).  

Almost  all  16  E.  coli  isolates  showed  resistance  to  at 
least one antimicrobial agent tested and, more than half,

et  al.,  2005;  Kurwijila  et  al.,  2006).  Therefore, 
more  extensive  research  is  needed  to  establish 
the magnitude of the antimicrobial residues and a 
concomitant  antimicrobial 
food 
animals.  The  multidrug  resistance  pattern  of  E. 
coli isolates is summarized in Table 3.  
 
 
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 
 
A total of 16 E. coli isolates were isolated from 65 
milk  samples  examined.  Almost  all  16  isolates 
showed  resistance  to  at  least  one  antibacterial 
agent  tested  and,  more  than  half  (14,  87.5%) 
showed multi-drug resistance pattern to the tested 
antibiotics. All 16 E. coli isolates were resistant  to 

resistance 

the  first  line  antibiotics,  penicillin  and  amoxicillin-
clavulanic acid, probably due to their frequent use 
in  dairy  units.  However,  some  of  the  isolates 
showed 
to  chloramphenicol  and 
ciprofloxacin  drugs  that  are  prohibited  for  use  in 
food-producing animals. This may be due to either 
illegal  use  of  the  drugs  or  transfer  of  resistant 
genes  as  a  result  of  interaction  with  human 
ecosystem.  

Although the resistant E. coli were isolated from 
milk samples that were not tested for antimicrobial 
residues,  there  is  a  possibility  that  antimicrobial 
residues  were  present  in  the  milk.  Therefore, 
extensive  research  is  proposed  to  establish  the 
relationship  between  antimicrobial  resistance  and 
antimicrobial residues in food animals  as  well  as 

to detect the pathogenic E. coli from the raw cow’s 
milk.  

Furthermore,  public  health  education  should  be 
given  to the public  concerning  the  prudent  use of 
antibiotics so as to avoid the problem of antibiotic 
resistance.  Additionally,  legislation  is  required  to 
enforce  proper  use  of  animal  and  human 
medicines 
to  minimize  cross-transmission  of 
resistant genes from animals to humans and vice 
versa.
