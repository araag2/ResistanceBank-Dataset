Abstract

Aim: This study was conducted to determine the occurrence of methicillin-sensitive and Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) 
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) from bovine mastitis and to characterize them with respect to antibiotic resistance 
gene mecA.
Materials and Methods: A total of 160 mastitic milk samples were screened for the presence of S. aureus. The presumptive 
positive isolates were confirmed using nuc and 23S rRNA gene-based polymerase chain reaction. All the confirmed isolates 
were subjected to in vitro antibiogram using a number of antibiotics. Isolates which showed resistance against methicillin 
were characterized for the presence of mecA gene.
Results:  Out  of  the  total  160  milk  samples,  36  (22.5%)  samples  yielded  S.  aureus. The  in  vitro  antibiogram  revealed 
that 16.6% S. aureus isolates were resistant to all antibiotics screened for and 5.5% isolates were sensitive to all of them. 
Furthermore, the study found 94.4%, 83.3%, 77.7%, 66.6%, 50%, and 27.7% of S. aureus isolates resistant to penicillin, 
ampicillin, amoxicillin-sulbactam, enrofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and methicillin, respectively. Out of the 36 S. aureus isolates, 
only 6 (16.6%) isolates were confirmed as MRSA while rest were MSSA.
Conclusion: The higher occurrence of S. aureus-mediated mastitis was concluded due to improper hygienic and poor farm 
management. The multiple drug resistance reveals the indiscriminate use of drugs and presence of methicillin resistance 
gene determinant is an alarming situation as such infections are difficult to treat.

Introduction

Staphylococcus  aureus  is  a  Gram-positive  coccal 
bacterium found commonly as commensal on skin and 
mucous membrane of upper respiratory and lower uro-
genital tract of humans and various animal species [1,2]. 
It has an ability to colonize and infect a variety of host 
species, including humans, farm and companion animals 
and wildlife. In case of animals, it is a primary and most 
lethal agent because it causes chronic and deep infections 
in the mammary glands that is extremely difficult to be 
cured [3]. S. aureus is the most prevalent and contagious 
pathogen that is found in 30-40% of all mastitic cases and 
80% of subclinical bovine mastitis which may result in 
about 35 billion US dollar annual losses worldwide [4,5].
The  mastitis  causing  ability  is  governed  by 
a  number  of  virulence  factors  which  are  either

structural  or  secretory  [6].  The  structural  virulence 
factors  include  protein  A,  capsular  polysaccharide, 
peptidoglycan  and  adhesions,  while  as  secretory 
includes  coagulase,  lipase,  hyaluronidase,  proteases 
and hemolysins [7,8].

Over the recent past, it has become difficult to 
control the virulent strains of S. aureus from causing 
mastitis. The reason being some strains of S. aureus 
have become resistant to various β-lactam antibiotics 
including the powerful ones in this class, i.e., methi-
cillin. Such strains of S. aureus are known as meth-
icillin-resistant  S.  aureus  (MRSA)  [9].  Methicillin 
resistance is caused by the acquisition of a mecA gene. 
This  produces  an  alternative  penicillin-binding  pro-
tein 2a (PBP2a), which has lower affinity for β-lactam 
antibiotics [10].

The increase in global prevalence of virulent and 
multidrug resistant S. aureus strains poses a renewed 
threat to the dairy industry which lays need to under-
take  research  for  addressing  the  issue.  Hence,  this 
study  was  aimed  at  isolation  and  molecular  charac-
terization of S. aureus isolates obtained from mastitic 
milk of various dairy farms in Jammu for methicillin 
governing gene determinant.

Ethical approval

The approval from the Institutional Animal Ethics 
Committee  to  carry  out  this  study  was  not  required 
as no invasive technique was used. The milk samples 
were collected from clinically affected animals with 
mastitis as per standard collection procedure.
Sampling

This study was based on a total of 160 milk sam-
ples (80 cows and 80 buffaloes) collected from clinical 
as well as subclinical mastitis cases. Before sampling, 
the  udders  were  inspected  for  externally  observed 
pathological  condition.  Each  milk  sample  was  col-
lected aseptically in a sterile screw-capped bottle from 
each  mammary  gland  after  washing  with  water  and 
cleaning the teats with cotton soaked in 70% ethanol. 
The samples were immediately taken to the laboratory 
for bacteriological analysis.
Isolation

Isolation of S. aureus was attempted according 
to  the  method  previously  described  by  Singh  and 
Prakash  with  slight  modification  [11].  Enrichment 
was  carried  out  in  peptone  water  enrichment  broth 
(HiMedia Pvt. Ltd., India). A loop full of milk sam-
ple  was  inoculated  in  sterile  enrichment  broth  and 
incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Subsequently, a loop full 
of inoculum from enrichment broth was streaked on 
Baird Parker agar (HiMedia Pvt. Ltd., India). After 
48  h  of  incubation  at  37°C,  colonies  appeared  as 
jet  black  surrounded  by  a  white  halo  characteris-
tic of S. aureus. The pure cultures were streaked on 
Nutrient  agar  slant  and  incubated  for  24  h  at  37°C 
and then stored at 4°C. The confirmation of the iso-
lates as S. aureus was done by demonstration of the 
typical cellular morphology in Gram stained smears 
(Gram-positive  cocci  that  occurred  in  clusters)  and 
biochemical  tests  such  as  catalase,  oxidase,  DNase 
and coagulase, respectively.
Extraction of DNA

Suspensions of the bacterial colonies maintained 
on  the  nutrient  agar  slant  were  prepared  in  1.5  ml 
microcentrifuge  tubes  in  250  μl  of  sterile  double 
distilled  water  by  gentle  mixing. The  samples  were 
boiled for 10 min, cooled on ice for 10 min and cen-
trifuged at 10,000×g for 5 min. 2 μl of the supernatant 
was used as the template for each polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR).

Molecular detection of S. aureus

The  presumptive  S.  aureus  isolates  were  con-
firmed by amplifying species-specific thermonuclease 
(nuc) gene as described previously [12]. The sequence 
of primers used is mentioned in Table-1. Isolates neg-
ative for nuc gene were subjected to another round of 
PCR using species-specific primers targeting the 23S 
rRNA gene [13].
Phenotypic detection of MRSA by oxacillin screening 
agar test

A  bacterial  suspension  equal  to  0.5  McFarland 
was smeared onto oxacillin resistance screening agar 
(ORSA) (HiMedia Pvt. Ltd., India), and the plate was 
incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Oxacillin resistance was 
confirmed by bacterial growth after 24 h of incubation 
at 37°C.
Antimicrobial sensitivity test

MRSA  and  methicillin  sensitive  and  S.  aureus 
(MSSA) isolates were subjected to disc diffusion anti-
microbial sensitivity test on Mueller-Hinton agar plates 
(HiMedia, Mumbai, India) as per the previous protocol 
described by Bauer et al. [14]. The six different anti-
microbial discs (HiMedia, Mumbai, India) used in this 
study  were  ampicillin,  amoxicillin-sulbactam,  ceftri-
oxone, enrofloxacin, methicillin, and pencillin.
Molecular detection of MRSA targeting mecA gene

All  the  S.  aureus  isolates  were  screened  for 
the presence of mecA gene as per the method earlier 
described [12].
Results

From  a  total  of  160  milk  samples  collected, 
132 (82.5%) samples revealed jet black colonies sur-
rounded by white halo indicating lecithinase activity 
on Baired Parker agar medium indicating presumptive 
S.  aureus  as  shown  in  Figure-1.  The  Gram-staining 
showed all these isolates were Gram-positive cocci, 
but  only  96  (72.7%)  isolates  showed  characteristic 
positive catalase and negative oxidase tests and were 
regarded as presumptive S. aureus. From the 96 iso-
lates, 72 (75%) isolates were positive for DNase test 
and showed typical depolymerization of DNA around 
the  bacterial  colonies  on  DNase  agar  as  shown  in 
Figure-2.
Molecular detection of S. aureus

Out of the 96 presumptive S. aureus isolates, 28 
were confirmed as S. aureus, as revealed by the ampli-
fication  of  270  bp  product  of  nuc  gene  specific  for

ence of mecA gene.
Molecular detection of MRSA targeting mecA gene

Out of the total 36 confirmed S. aureus isolates, 
6 (16.6%) isolates were confirmed to be MRSA when 
subjected to PCR amplification using specific primers 
for mecA gene. The PCR product appeared as a single 
band with a size close to the expected size of 533 bp 
(Figure-6).
Discussion

S. aureus causes one of the most common types 
of  chronic  mastitis  in  dairy  animals  worldwide.  It 
has  been  found  responsible  for  more  than  80%  of 

S. aureus (Figure-3). Out of the nuc gene negative iso-
lates, 8 more were confirmed S. aureus in species-spe-
cific PCR targeting 23S rRNA gene (Figure-4). Thus, 
out of 96 presumptive isolates of S. aureus, 36 (37.5%) 
were found positive on the basis of molecular tests.
Phenotypic detection of MRSA isolates on ORSA

The  methicillin  resistance  was  ascertained  to 
check the sensitivity and specificity of MRSA isolates 
in comparison to molecular detection of MRSA. Only 
20 isolates showed growth on ORSA showing lesser 
sensitivity  and  specificity  than  molecular  methods 
(Figure-5).
Antibiogram of S. aureus isolates

Antibiotic  sensitivity  assay  revealed  that  out 
of 36 isolates, 34 (94.4%) of isolates were resistant 
to  penicillin,  30  (83.3%)  to  ampicillin,  28  (77.7%) 
to  amoxicillin-sulbactam,  24  (66.6%)  to  enroflox-
acin,  18  (50%)  were  resistant  to  ceftriaxone,  and 
10  (27.70%)  were  resistant  to  methicillin.  Two  iso-
lates were sensitive to all antibiotics used while as six 
isolates turned out to be resistant to all of them. The 10 
methicillin-resistant isolates on antibiogram included

are well established. Only 28 (29.1%) isolates could 
be confirmed by nuc gene. However, nuc gene neg-
ative  isolates  showed  further  eight  isolates  positive 
for  S.  aureus  in  23S  rRNA  specific-PCR.  Hence,  it 
is  recommended  that  for  molecular  identification  of 
S. aureus both nuc and 23Sr RNA gene-specific PCR 
should  be  carried  out.  Even,  when  both  the  genes 
were targeted only 36 (37.5%) of presumptive isolates 
could be confirmed. This detection level of S. aureus 
from mastitic milk is low when compared with that 
of  Kuzma  et  al.  [19]  and  Bharathy  et  al.  [20]  who 
detected  100%  and  65.57%  of  isolates  positive  by 
PCR. The probable reason may be due to other etio-
logical factors belonging to Enterobacteriaceae asso-
ciated with mastitis.

MRSA  is  a  feature  of  modern  day  health-care 
across  the  world.  Methicillin  resistance  in  staphy-
lococci is mediated by the mecA gene, encoding the 
PBP2a, which has a reduced affinity for the penicilli-
nase resistant penicillins like methicillin and oxacillin 
and for all other beta-lactam antibiotics [21]. In this 
investigation,  55.5%  of  the  isolated  S.  aureus  were 
phenotypically resistant to oxacillin and only 16.6% 
of isolated S. aureus strains were carrying the mecA 
gene  and  identified  as  MRSA.  The  variation  in  the 
phenotypic and the genotypic results may be due to 
the  presence  of  MRSA  encoding  a  divergent  mecA 
gene. This divergent homolog is referred as mecC.

The  emergence  of  antimicrobial  resistance 
among animal pathogens is of growing concern in vet-
erinary medicine as it renders antimicrobials ineffec-
tive for treating the animals. The antibiogram pattern 
revealed that 94.4% of all the isolates were resistant 
to  penicillin.  Similar  results  were  obtained  by  Sori 
et al. [22] who reported that out of 86 pure isolates 
of S. aureus 87.2% were resistant to penicillin while 
as Khakpoor et al. [23] in other study reported that all 
isolate of S. aureus from mastitic cattle were resistant 
to penicillin. The occurrence of 83.3% resistance to 
ampicillin  in  this  study  is  much  higher  than  that  of 
41.44% as reported by Mubarack et al. [24] and lower 
as compared to 100% resistance reported by Khakpoor 
et al. [23]. In this study, 66.6% isolates turned out to 
be resistant to enrofloxacin. This is quite contrary to 
Hussain  et  al.  [25]  who  report  94.73%  and  69.56% 
S.  aureus  isolates  were  susceptible  to  enrofloxacin, 
respectively.  The  50%  resistance  to  ceftriaxone  is 
almost in agreement with that of Khakpoor et al. [23] 
who reported 42.10% susceptibility to ceftriaxone.
Conclusion

Improper  hygiene  and  poor  farm  manage-
mental practices in the dairy farms could be respon-
sible for contamination of udder resulting in mastitis. 
There  is  higher  occurrence  of  S.  aureus-mediated 
mastitis  in  Jammu  region.  For  molecular  identifi-
cation  of  S.  aureus  both  thermonuclease  (nuc)  gene 
and  23S  rRNA  gene-specific  PCR  should  be  used

subclinical bovine mastitis which results in huge eco-
nomic losses to farmers in India [15]. In our study, out 
of 160 mastitic milk samples collected from different 
regions of Jammu province of India, only 22.5% of 
cases were found due to S. aureus. These results are 
comparatively lower than those formerly documented 
by some authors [16,17] who observed a prevalence 
of  30.6%  and  55%  which  may  be  possibly  because 
of  improper  hygiene  and  poor  farm  management 
practices.  However,  Unnerstad  et  al.  [18]  have  also 
reported  that  the  most  frequently  isolated  bacterial 
species was S. aureus constituting 21.3% of the diag-
noses carried out national wide in Sweden. S. aureus 
isolates can be easily identified by cultural and bio-
chemical tests, but these phenotypic characterization 
procedures  are  relative, so  it  is  common  practice to 
confirm the isolates with molecular tests. Two molec-
ular  tests  one  targeting  the  thermonuclease  (nuc)

S.  aureus  isolates  individually.  The  variation  in  the 
phenotypic  and  the  genotypic  typing  of  S.  aureus 
as MRSA and MSSA may be due to the presence of 
MRSA  encoding  a  divergent  mecA  gene  like  mecC. 
Hence,  it  is  recommended  that  both  the  variants 
should be covered for genotypic typing of S. aureus. 
Unusually,  high  resistance  of  S.  aureus  isolates  to 
enrofloxacin indicates its indiscriminate use in clini-
cal practice, hence alarming.
