Abstract

Aim: Aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence, virulence gene profiles, and antimicrobial resistance pattern of 
Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) in diarrheic buffalo calves from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana States.
Materials and Methods: A total of 375 fecal samples from diarrheic buffalo calves of 1-7, 8-30, 31-60, and 61-90 days 
age were collected from which STEC were isolated, and virulence genes were detected using multiplex polymerase chain 
reaction. The antimicrobial resistance of isolates was tested by disk diffusion method.
Results:  The  prevalence  of  E.  coli  associated  diarrhea  in  buffalo  calves  was  85.04%,  of  which  35.01%  was  STEC 
origin. In STEC, the combination of eaeA and, hlyA virulence genes was highest (42.45%) followed by stx1 (16.04%), 
stx1, stx2 and hlyA (13.21%), stx2 (12.64%), stx1, eae and hlyA (9.43%) and stx1 and hlyA (6.6%) genes were detected. 
Highest antimicrobial resistance was observed for tetracycline (63.21%) and ampicillin (48.11%), while chloramphenicol, 
gentamycin (96.33%) and imipenem (99.06%) antibiotics are susceptible. Multidrug resistance was detected in 69.81% of 
the STEC isolates from diarrheic buffalo calves.
Conclusion: Higher prevalence of eaeA and hlyA genes carrying isolates of STEC may be a serious zoonotic threat and 
increased prevalence of multidrug resistance in E. coli may necessitate stringent selection of appropriate antimicrobial agent 
in treating buffalo calf diarrhea cases.

Calf  diarrhea  is  a  complex  syndrome  with 
complex  etiopathogenesis  causing  economic  loss 
directly  through  mortality  and  indirectly  through 
treatment costs and reduced growth rates in affected 
calves [1]. The mortality rate is high, particularly in 
buffalo calves of <3 months age in India [2]. Among 
all  the  etiological  agents  responsible  for  calf  diar-
rhea, Escherichia coli are recognized as the leading 
cause [3]. Shiga toxigenic E. coli (STEC) is one of the 
pathogenic groups of E. coli that has zoonotic origin 
and cattle being recognized as the major reservoir for 
human infections.

In calves, STEC is the main cause of diarrhea and 
dysentery particularly in very young calves [4]. The 
pathogenicity  of  STEC  is  mediated  mainly  through 
Shiga toxins 1 and 2 encoded by stx1 and stx2 genes,

respectively [5], intimin, an outer membrane surface 
adhesin encoded by eaeA gene [6] and enterohemo-
lysin (ehly) which is encoded by the hlyA gene [7]. 
Antimicrobial therapy is an important tool in reduc-
ing the incidence and treatment of diarrhea in calves. 
However,  widespread  and  indiscriminate  use  of 
antimicrobial  agents  leads  to  multi-drug  resistant 
pathogenic  bacteria  in  calves,  resulting  difficulty  in 
treatment [8].

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investi-
gate the diversity and distribution of virulence genes 
and to understand antimicrobial resistance epidemiol-
ogy of STEC isolated from diarrheic buffalo calves in 
Andhra Pradesh and Telangana States.

Ethical approval

Ethical approval was not necessary for this study. 
However, samples were collected as per standard col-
lection procedure without harming or giving stress to 
the animals.
Sample collection

A total of 375 fecal samples from diarrheic buf-
falo calves of 1-7, 8-30, 31-60, and 61-90 days age were 
collected  randomly  from  organized  dairy  farms  and

East  Godavari,  West  Godavari,  Krishna,  Guntur, 
Prakasam,  Districts  of  Andhra  Pradesh  State  and 
Ranga Reddy and Khammam Districts of Telangana 
State during the period from May 2014 to November 
2015. Geographical distribution and age of diarrheic 
calves  were  recorded  during  sampling.  Fecal  sam-
ples  were  collected  using  sterile  rectal  swabs. After 
collection,  the  swabs  were  immediately  transported 
to the Department of Veterinary Microbiology, NTR 
College  of  Veterinary  Science,  Gannavaram  in  ice-
cooled containers for E. coli isolation. All the samples 
were inoculated on MacConkey agar and incubated at 
37°C for 24 h. The pink colonies obtained were again 
inoculated  on  EMB  agar,  and  the  colonies  showing 
green metallic sheen were selected and confirmed as 
E. coli by standard biochemical tests [9] and by poly-
merase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  amplifying  16S  rRNA 
gene [10].
DNA isolation

Isolation of DNA from E. coli was carried out 
by conventional boiling and snap chilling method [11] 
with slight modifications. A single colony was inocu-
lated in 1 ml tryptic soy broth and incubated at 37°C 
for 24 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation 
at 5000 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was washed with 
phosphate buffer saline by centrifuging at 500 rpm for 
10 min for twice. Then, the pellet was resuspended in 
500 µl nuclease free water and boiled for 5-10 min at 
100°C and snap chilled on ice, after centrifugation at 
1000 rpm for 5 min; supernatant was used as template 
DNA.
Detection of Shiga toxigenic E. coli

The  primers  used  in  the  present  study  for  the 
detection of Shiga toxin producing E. coli were as 
described [5] (Table-1). Multiplex PCR for amplifi-
cation  of  the  stx1,  stx2,  eaeA,  and  hlyA  genes  was 
set up in 25 µl reaction contained 3 µl of bacterial 
lysate,  2.5  µl  of  10×  PCR  buffer  with  1.5  mM  of 
MgCl2, 250 nM of each forward primer and reverse 
primer,  0.5  µl  of  10 Mm  dNTP’S  and  0.5  units  of 
Taq DNA polymerase, and autoclaved milli-Q water 
to  make  volume  to  25  µl.  Samples  were  subjected 
to 35 PCR cycles, each consisting of 1 min of dena-
turation at 95°C; 2 min of annealing at 65°C for the 
first 10 cycles, decrementing to 60°C by cycle 15, 
and 1.5 min of elongation at 72°C, incrementing to 

2.5 min from cycles 25 to 35. PCR reaction mixtures 
were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels and stained 
with ethidium bromide.
Antibiotic susceptibility testing

Antimicrobial  resistance  against  18  different 
antibiotics,  i.e.,  for  ampicillin,  cefotaxime,  ceftazi-
dime, amoxicillin clavulanic acid, gentamycin, kana-
mycin,  streptomycin,  sulfisoxazole,  cotrimoxazole, 
nalidixic  acid,  ciprofloxacin,  aztreonam  piperacil-
lintazobactem,  tetracyclin,  chloramphenicol,  mero-
penem, imipenem, and nitrofurantoin was studied by 
disk diffusion method [12]. The diameter of the zone 
of inhibition was compared with the standard known 
value  against  each  specific  antimicrobial  agent  as 
suggested  in  the  product  information  (interpretation 
guideline) from manufacturer.
Results and Discussion

This  study  detected  80.53%  prevalence  of 
E. coli in diarrheic buffalo calves in AP and TS states 
(Table-2),  and  the  prevalence  (88.20%)  was  highest 
in  commercial  diaries  than  in  buffalo  calves  main-
tained by individual farmers (72.86%). This might be 
due  to  unhygienic  housing,  poor  feeding,  and  man-
agement of buffalo calves in commercial diaries than 
at  individual  farmers.  The  prevalence  rate  reported 
in  this  study  was  higher  than  prevalence  of  E.  coli 
reported in diarrheic buffalo calves in Jabalpur, India 
(59.37%) [13], Egypt (66 and 72%) [14,15], Pakistan 
(14.6%) [16], and Bangladesh (45) [17]. The differ-
ences  of  the  prevalence  rates  of  E.  coli  in  diarrheic 
calves may be attributed to the geographical locations 
and management practices as well as hygienic mea-
sures which influence the susceptibility of calves to 
E. coli infection [18,19].

This study also observed the highest prevalence 
of E. coli (85.04%) associated diarrhea in 1-7 days age 
buffalo calves followed by 83.96% and 63.27% prev-
alence in 8-30 and 31-60 day age groups, while lowest 
(50.0%) prevalence was observed in 61-90 days age 
buffalo calves (Table-2). Higher prevalence in younger 
calves may be due to increased susceptibility to E. coli 
infection [20-22] and predisposing factors like over-
crowding and malnutrition, which are supposed to be 
a primary cause of immunosuppression [14]. Further, 
E. coli is a commensal organism and is responsible for 
diarrhea in calves, particularly calves receiving less or

is mainly used for commercial purposes [23].

Among  the  E.  coli  isolates,  35.10%  were 
detected as STEC by multiplex PCR (Figure-1) which 
was  higher  (6.8%)  and  lower  (47.30%)  than  STEC 
reported  from  fecal  samples  of  diarrheic  buffalo 
calves in Italy [24] and diarrheic calves in Iran [25]. 
Studies  carried  out  in  different  countries  by  several 
researchers revealed that 10-80% of cattle may carry 
STEC [26]. These differences might be due to vari-
ation in environment which has an influence on the 
shedding of STEC in calves [27].

The virulence gene profile of the STEC isolates 
from diarrheic calves was found in diverse combina-
tions (Table-3 and Figure-1).

The  STEC  isolates  carrying  eaeA  and  hlyA 
genes  were  most  prevalent  (42.45%).  Similar

prevalence  rate  of  eaeA  and  hlyA  genes  harboring 
isolates  from  diarrheic  calves  was  also  reported 
in  other  studies  [6,28].  Several  investigators  have 
reported  that  the  strong  association  between  the 
carriage  of  eaeA  gene,  and  the  capacity  of  STEC 
to  cause  severe  human  disease  [6,29].  Therefore, 
higher prevalence of eaeA and hlyA genes in STEC 
isolates  from  diarrheic  buffalo  calves  detected  in 
the  present  study  may  be  a  serious  zoonotic  threat 
in this geographic region. The STEC isolates carry-
ing 16.04% of Stx1 and 12.26% of Stx2 genes in the 
present  study  was  lower  than  reported  in  Iran  [30] 
but higher than reported in India [31], Poland [32], 
and Turkey [33]. However, higher prevalence of stx1 
gene than stx2 gene observed from diarrheic calves 
in  the  present  study  is  comparable  to  the  observa-
tions in Argentina [34] and in Austria [35].

The antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed 
69.81% of the STEC isolates were resistant to three 
or more of the antimicrobial agents tested. Among the 
STEC  isolates,  highest  percentage  of  antimicrobial 
resistance was observed for tetracycline (63.21), fol-
lowed by ampicillin (48.11%), aztreonam (36.79%), 
cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and streptomycin, (31.13%), 
nalidixic  acid  (29.25%),  sulfisoxazole  (28.30%), 
cotrimoxazole (26.42%), amoxicillin clavulanic acid 
(20.75%),  piperacillintazobactem  (18.87%)  mero-
penem 
(17.92%)  kanamycin  and  nitrofurantoin 
(12.26%)  ciprofloxacin  (4.72),  chloramphenicol  and 
gentamycin  (3.77%)  while  lowest  %  of  0.94  was 
observed for imipenem antibiotics. The present find-
ings were corroborated with findings of 100% multi-
drug resistance in STEC isolates from diarrheic calves 
in Brazil [36].

Several  investigators  [36-38]  around  the  world 
also detected highest antibiotic resistance for E. coli 
isolates  from  diarrheic  calves  to  tetracycline  antibi-
otic. Highest sensitivity of the STEC isolates to chlor-
amphenicol  and  gentamycin  antibiotics  observed  in 
the  present  study  was  comparable  with  findings  of 
Wani et al. [31] and Rehman et al. [39] who reported 
higher  sensitivity  for  STEC  isolates  from  diarrheic 
calves to chloramphenicol and gentamycin antibiotics 
in Jammu and Kashmir of India.

The present results concluded higher prevalence 
of eaeA and hlyA genes in STEC from diarrheic buf-
falo  calves  may  be  a  serious  zoonotic  threat  in  this 
geographical region. Further, the multidrug resistance 
of STEC isolates may necessitates stringent selection
