Abstract

A study was made of Salmonella contamination in beef sampled from a slaughterhouse and from retailers in Dakar, Senegal. The serotypes as

well as antibiotic-resistance patterns of the Salmonella isolates were determined.

A total of 435 meat samples (236 from the slaughterhouse, 199 from retailers) were tested. Among them, 275 (63%) were positive for
Salmonella, 43% (101/236) from the slaughterhouse and 87% (174/199) from the retailers. Furthermore, 97% of the investigated retailers had at
least one beef sample contaminated by Salmonella.

The 286 Salmonella isolates were divided into 51 serotypes. The most prevalent serotypes were Salmonella bredeney (25%), S. muenster (8%),
S. waycross (7%), S. corvallis (4%) and S. kentucky (4%). About 62% of the isolates were resistant to nitrofurans. Resistance rates were lower to
streptomycin (22%), sulfamethoxazole (15%), spectinomycin (1%), chloramphenicol (1%), and tetracycline (0,4%) while low-level resistance to
quinolones was detected. About 16% of the Salmonella strains were multiresistant to two or more antibiotic families. Finally, ten resistance
profiles have been identified.

This study shows the huge spread of Salmonella in the beef production chain in Dakar, Senegal. Finally, this study provides the very first data

about Salmonella prevalence in sub-saharian Africa.

1. Introduction

After malaria and respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases
are one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality especially
for children in developing countries. Among those diseases,

salmonellosis is considered as the most common foodborne
disease in developing countries as well as in industrialized ones,
although incidence rates vary according to the country (Motarjemi
et al., 1995).

The development and the accumulation of resistance to
antibiotics in these pathogens are a major issue in public health.
It is generally accepted that, in developing countries some multi-
resistant Salmonella are of animal origin and acquire their
resistance in animals before being transmitted to human through

the food chain (White et al., 2001; Threlfall, 2002). In the United
States, a study showed that 20% of 200 samples of ground chicken
(35%, n= 51), beef (6%, n = 50), turkey (24%, n = 50) and pork
(16%, n= 49) purchased at three retail store are infected by Sal-
monella (White et al., 2001).

In developing countries, the few surveys available as well as
the lack of surveillance network make it difficult to assess the
magnitude of these diseases. Very few data exist in particular for
the Sahelian area.

The incidence of food-borne infections is poorly known in
Senegal, reporting of food-borne outbreaks being not mandatory.
It is therefore difficult to estimate the extent of the phenomenon.
Nevertheless, periodic epidemics indicate wide spread circulation
of the causative organism: cholera in Dakar in 2004, Salmonella
multi-resistant to antibiotics in 2001 (Cardinale et al., 2001) and a
multicentric study undertaken on street food indicate significant
contamination (Garin et al., 2002). Various studies carried out in
hospitals also highlighted many cases of diarrhoeal syndromes
due to Salmonella (Lafaix et al., 1979; Cissé et al., 1991, 1993). In
a study of Salmonella serotypes isolated over 6 years at the pae-
diatric hospital (Cissé et al., 1993), 55% of the isolated strains
were non-typhoid. Seventeen percent of the isolated Salmonella
strains were multiresistant to antibiotics and 8% produced a beta-
lactamase.

Analyses carried out at the Food Safety and Environmental
Hygiene Laboratory of the Institut Pasteur de Dakar show a high
contamination, by fecal peril germs (Escherichia coli, Salmonel-
la, sulfito-reducing Clostridium), of food products (prepared
meals, fresh vegetables, cold meals, pastries, dairy products) and
in particular a contamination of meat products (butcher's meats)
(unpublished data).

In meat production, the leading source of contamination of
carcasses by Salmonella is the evisceration step at the slaughter-
house (Samuel et al., 1980). In Ethiopia, approximately 20% of
camel carcasses were found positive for Salmonella at slaughtering.
At the retailers' level, 15% of the meat samples were found positive
for Salmonella in Ethiopia (Ejeta et al., 2004). In Senegal, no data
on Salmonella prevalence on beef was yet available.

The microbiological quality of meat sandwiches sold on the
streets was studied in Dakar, in 1997. The results showed that
52% of the samples were microbiologically nonsatisfactory
regarding European microbiological criteria (Garin et al., 2002).
Then another study, undertaken in 2000, in the poultry industry
highlighted a new Salmonella pathogenic strain multiresistant
to antibiotics (Cardinale et al., 2001). This strain was isolated in
farm stock as well as among hospitalized patients.

Food poisoning due to Salmonella in Senegal is a public
health issue, but its origins are so far poorly known. A survey
carried out for the Farming Department provided the opportu-
nity to obtain data on meat contamination by Salmonella, no
previous data being available. The high contamination rate
raised questions about the rest of the meat production chain and
its implication in human infections.

This work describes the prevalence, serotypes and pheno-
types of antibiotic-resistance of Salmonella strains found in
meat sampled at the slaughterhouse and retailers in Dakar,
Senegal. This survey provides data for the sub-saharian area.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sampling and survey

Bovine carcasses were collected at the only official city
slaughterhouse at the end of slaughtering operations, prior to
storage in cold room. A total of 236 carcasses were collected at the
slaughterhouse. An average of 6 carcasses per slaughtering day
(1–10) were randomly collected out of the 100 to 150 animals
slaughtered daily. Sample collection was carried out between
7:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. (between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. for
70% of the samples) during April to July 2003.

In addition, 199 samples from 73 retailers were randomly
selected out: 34 samples from 10 modern butcher shops, 83
samples from 170 market stalls, 43 samples from 20 districts
retailers, 39 samples from 100 itinerant retailers. The origin of
the retailers' meat was the official city slaughterhouse,
previously sampled. An average of 8 samples per day was
collected between April and August 2004.

Each sample was accompanied by a questionnaire filled out
at
the time of the collection. At
the
information collected related to husbandary practices (extensive
or intensive), breed, sex, age and animal weight, area of origin,
carcass conformation (visual appreciation), and presence of
subcutaneous and internal fat. No information regarding the
administration of antibiotics was available.

the slaughterhouse,

At retailers, information about structure and practices were
collected: temperature conditions of the meat transfer from the
slaughterhouse to the place of sale (frozen, chilled or room
temperature), storage temperature conditions (frozen, chilled or
room temperature), cleanliness of the cutting tools, covering
materials on the cutting up tables, cleaning and disinfecting
operations, wash basin and W.C. presence, establishment size,
personal cleanliness of workers, existence of specific work
clothing. Finally, the surface and internal temperatures of the
samples were measured at the time of the collection with a
digital probe.

2.2. Sample collection

At the slaughterhouse, samples were collected in the following
way: a piece of meat of approximately 50 g was excised from the
internal face of the thigh (no prolonged contact with the
surroundings) and placed in a sterile plastic pouch. After collection,
the pouches were placed at 0–10 °C in the slaughterhouse
refrigerator, then transported to the laboratory (less than 24 h after
collection) and stored in the freezer (−25 °C) until analysis.

At the retailers, after cutting up by the salesman, approxi-
mately 50 g of meat was sampled into a sterile plastic pouch
then transported at 0–10 °C to the laboratory where they were
frozen (−25 °C) until analysis.

2.3. Salmonella isolation and serotype determination

The samples were analyzed according to the NF V08-052
standard method (French Normalisation Association). Briefly, 25 g
of each sample was placed in a sterile pouch sachet, 225 ml of

180

Buffered Peptone Water (Biorad/356-4684/Biorad/Marnes la
coquette/France) were added, and the whole was homogenized
on a Stomacher® (AES laboratoires/Stomacher 80/AES labor-
atoires/Combourg/France). Pre-enrichments were incubated at
37 °C for 16–20 h. Two milliliters and 0.1 ml of the pre-enrichment
were then respectively transferred in 20 ml of selenite cystine broth
(Biorad/356-4074/Biorad/Marnes la coquette/France) and 10 ml of
Rappaport–Vassiliadis broth (Biorad/356-4324/Biorad/Marnes la
coquette/France), and incubated for 18–24 h at 37 °C (selenite
cystine) and at 42 °C (Rappaport Vassiliadis). Afterwards, one
Hektoen Agar plate (Biorad/356-4284/Biorad/Marnes la coquette/
France) per tube was inoculated and incubated at 37 °C for 18–
24 h. Plates were then examined to identify Salmonella presence.
Two presumptive colonies per sample were picked and grown on
nutrient agar for purification, and then biochemically characterized
using the Kligler–Hajna (Biorad/64844/Biorad/Marnes la co-
quette/France), urea–indole (Biorad/63713/Biorad/Marnes la
coquette/France), Voges–Proskauer (Biorad/355-3911/Biorad/
Marnes la coquette/France), and lysine decarboxylase tests
(Biorad/355-3911/Biorad/Marnes la coquette/France). Agglutina-
tion tests were carried out on presumptive Salmonella strains by

the Enterobacteria National Reference Center, Dakar on the basis
of O somatic antigens and phase 1 and phase 2 flagellar antigens
agglutination with antisera (Bio-Rad, Marnes La Coquette,
France) according to the White–Kauffman–Le Minor scheme.

2.4. Bacterial sensitivity tests to antibiotics

The sensitivity of strains to antibiotics were performed by the
Enterobacteria National Reference Center, at the Institut Pasteur
de Dakar, Senegal.

The following molecules were tested: beta-lactams (ampicil-
lin, amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, ticarcillin, cefalotin, cefoxitin,
cefotaxim, and ceftazidim), aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobra-
mycin, amikacin, and spectinomycin), quinolone antibiotics
(nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, pefloxacin, and norfloxacin),
tetracycline, chloramphenicol, nitrofurans, trimethoprim, sulpho-
namids (sulfamethoxazol) and the trimethoprim–sulfamethox-
azol combination.

Inhibition zone diameters were read on the SIRSCAN
antimicrobial susceptibility system (SIRSCAN 2000, Web
version, I2A).

2.5. Statistical analysis

The Statcalc module of the Epi Info™ software was used to
perform Ki2 tests on the results, with 10% accuracy and 5%
risk.

3. Results

3.1. Characterization of the slaughterhouse samples

The information obtained at the slaughterhouse allowed us to
characterize the animals from which the samples were collected.
The carcasses sampled were distributed equally between
intensive (n = 117) and extensive rearing system (n = 119). The
animals coming from intensive breeding were significantly
heavier than those from extensive breeding.

In Senegal, the intensive system is generally a final fattening
stage for animals reared extensively. Nevertheless, some
stockbreeders are developing practices close to those used in
western developed countries.

The animals were 78% Peulh zebus (Gobras) (n = 183), 20%
Moors zebus (n = 47), 2% Ndamas (n = 5), and one animal was
not identified. Bulls represented 83% (n = 197) of the animals,
cows 14% (n = 32) and castrated animals 3% (n = 7).

Most of the animals (n = 92, 39%) came from the Zone
Sylvo-Pastorale, an extensive cattle-breeding area in the north-
east of Senegal while 22% (52) came from the Bambey–
Djourbel zone, an intensive cattle-breeding area, east of Dakar.
Finally, 11% of the animals (n = 25) came from Mali.

About half of the carcasses (n = 110, 47%) were of good shape,
11% of bad conformation (n = 27), the remainder (n = 99) of ave-
rage conformation. This was visually judged by the veterinary of
the slaughterhouse.

3.2. Characterization of the retailers' samples

The survey analysis enabled us to group the beef retailers
(Table 1). Of the 4 types investigated, only modern butcher
shops were large, usually employing more than 5 persons, other
structures employed one to two people. Modern butcher shops
were also the ones more frequently having a washbasin, cutting
tables made of resin and specific work clothing. Most other
establishments globally had poor equipment hygiene and poor
hygiene practices. While retailers usually transported and stored
the meat at room temperature, modern butcher shops frequently
executed these steps at 0 to 10 °C.

3.3. Isolated Salmonella prevalence

Among the 435 samples analyzed, 63% (275) were positive for
Salmonella. Of the 236 slaughterhouse samples, 101 (43%) were
positive for Salmonella. At the retailers, 87% (174) of the samples
were contaminated by one or more Salmonella (Table 2).
Furthermore two different serotypes were isolated from 11
samples. In summary, 71% (24) of the modern butcher shops
samples, 99% (82) of the market samples, 67% (29) of samples
from district retailers and 100% (39) of the samples from itinerant
retailers were positive for one or more Salmonella (Table 2).
Samples positive for Salmonella were detected from 97% (150) of
the retailers. Only one modern butcher shop and one district
retailer provided samples free from Salmonella.

3.4. Slaughterhouse sample characteristics and Salmonella
prevalence

No significant difference (p = 0.77) between intensive and
extensive stock rearing practices was found. Furthermore, neither
the animals' area of origin (p = 0.35), weight (p = 0.51), age
(p = 0.30), sex (p= 0.18), race (p = 0.50), or carcass conformation
(p = 0.29) had any impact on the prevalence of Salmonella.

3.5. Retailers samples characteristics and Salmonella
prevalence

Meat transfer at room temperature did not seem to increase the
risk to find Salmonella in the samples (p=0.02); on the other hand,
storage at room temperature did increase it (p= 0.008). The
complete data on establishment hygiene confirmed that it did affect
the risk of detecting Salmonella in meat: the tools cleanliness
(p=0.00005), cleaning and disinfecting (p=0.00002), coating of
cutting tables (p= 0.008), specific work clothing (p= 0.00003) and
standard of personal cleanliness (p=0.002) decreased the risk of
Salmonella presence in meat.

3.6. Serotypes distribution

Salmonella isolated from the 275 positive samples were of
51 different serotypes. The most common, 56% of the isolates,
were bredeney (n = 71), muenster (n = 21), waycross (n = 18),
corvallis (n = 12) and kentucky (n = 10) (Table 3).

At the slaughterhouse, S. bredeney largely prevailed (n = 69,
71% of the isolates), followed by S. hindmarsh (n= 9, 9.7%) and
by S. orianenburg (n= 6, 6.45%). The Ki2 test did not give a
significant difference in the frequency of serotype isolation de-
pending on breeding practice (intensive/extensive), race, geo-
graphical origin or carcass conformation.

Concerning the samples from modern butcher shops, the 19
isolates were of 10 serotypes. S. muenster (6; 24.0%), S. way-
cross (3; 12.0%), S. corvallis and S. abaetetuba (2; 8%) repre-
sented around 50% of the isolates.

The 72 Salmonella isolates from markets meats were from 33
serotypes: S. kentucky (9; 11.1%), S. muenster (8; 9.9%), S. cor-
vallis (6; 7.4%), S. sendai (5; 6.2%) and S. montevideo (4; 4.9%)
prevailed.

In samples from district retailers, the 20 isolates belonged to 10
serotypes: S. waycross (9; 29.0%) and S. muenster (3; 9.7%)
prevailed.

The 27 isolates from itinerant retailers meats were divided into
18 serotypes: S. westphalia (5; 13.5%), S. waycross (4; 10.8%),
and S. corvallis (3; 8.1%) represented 42% of the isolates.

Some serotypes (S. muenster, S. bredeney, and S. branden-
burg) were found both in slaughterhouse and in retailers' samples.
S. bredeney, which prevailed at the slaughterhouse, appeared only
rarely at retailers. Others serotypes (S. corvallis, S. waycross,
S. offa) seemed retailer specific.

3.7. Antibiotic resistance

AMC: amoxicillin + clavulinic acid, AMX: amoxicillin, AN: amikacin, C:

A high proportion of the strains was resistant to nitrofurans
(111; 62.4%), and to a lesser extent to streptomycin (53; 21.5%)
and to sulfamethoxazol (35; 14.7%) (Table 4). Two isolates were
resistant
two to chloramphenicol, one to
tetracycline and one to pefloxacin. Similar rates of resistant strains

to spectinomycin,

were observed in samples from modern butcher shops, markets
and itinerant retailers. Strains isolated from slaughterhouse meat
were less resistant to nitrofurans. Those from the district retailers'
meats were proportionally more resistant: the difference was
significant
in comparison with slaughterhouse samples and
samples from markets when comparing the places two to two.
The proportion of multi-resistant strains in retailers' samples
confirmed these data (Table 5).

3.8. Serotypes and resistance to antibiotics (Table 5)

On the 247 investigated isolates, 55 (22%) were not resistant,
149 (60%) were resistant to at least one and 43 (17.4%) were
resistant to more than two antibiotics from different families.
Table 6 summarizes the resistance patterns of the most frequent
serotypes.

Among the more frequently found serotypes, S. bredeney,
primarily found at the slaughter-house, comprised six different
resistance types. S. corvallis, found in meat from all four of the
retailers types, comprised only two different resistance profiles. The
majority (7; 70%) of S. kentucky isolates was from the same market
and comprised three resistance patterns.

S. muenster was found in all district retailers' samples: the 22
identified isolates were from twelve different collection places
and comprised four resistance profiles. S. waycross isolates were
from samples collected in twelve different places and comprised
five different patterns.

Six samples collected the same day from different retailers
yielded eight isolates, all multi-resistant. Six were S. waycross
(FT S, FT S SSS, FT S SPT SSS), one was S. muenster FT S
SSS and one S. vinhorady FT S SSS. The last two had been
isolated together with one S. waycross FT S SSS and one FT S
SPT SSS respectively. Three of the retailers belonged to the
same company and were supplied by the same vehicle so a
common contamination source can be considered.

4. Discussion

4.1. Prevalence and distribution of Salmonella serotypes

High prevalence rates of Salmonella isolated from beef at the
slaughterhouse (43%) and among retailers (90%) highlight a
very strong contamination of the bovine meat chain in Dakar.
The samples were frozen prior to analysis, which could have
affected the recovery of some strains and serotypes. However,
the high Salmonella prevalence indicate that this effect was
probably nor major, although low levels of contamination may
not have been identified after freezing.

In an Ethiopian slaughterhouse, Salmonella contaminated
5.6% of meat samples (Molla et al., 2003). For confirmation, the
authors used Brilliant-Green and Macconkey agars. A Nigerian
survey found 25% of Salmonella prevalence in beef samples at
the slaughterhouse, and 15.6% at retail (Orji et al., 2005). In
another survey conducted at a South-African slaughterhouse,
60% of the samples were positive (Nel et al., 2004). Nel et al.
worked on 10 g of sample and used Rappaport–Vassiliadis broth
(Oxoid) as single selective enrichment broth. In Australia,
Salmonella was found in 0.1% of slaughterhouse beef samples;
in that case surveys were carried out on surface samples collected
using sponge collecting kits (Phillips et al., 2001). In Ireland,
7.6% of the carcasses were contaminated (McEvoy et al., 2003)
using immunomagnetic capture from impregnated sponges. In a
survey of meat marketed in Ethiopia, Ejeta et al. found that 15% of
the samples were positive for Salmonella (Ejeta et al., 2004).

Differences in sample collection as well as the various
techniques used in these different surveys can explain most of the
important variations observed among prevalence. However, the
rates found in Senegal are still particularly high. There is a
noticeable correlation between better hygiene and a relatively lower
prevalence.

It is worthy to note that more serotypes were isolated at retailers
(47 serotypes) than at the slaughterhouse (11 serotypes). Some
serotypes such as bredeney, kentucky, muenster, and offa were
found in both types of samples. S. bredeney was largely prevalent
at the slaughterhouse, but was rarely found in retailers' samples.
At the slaughterhouse the former serotype exhibited six profiles of
resistance to antibiotics. The survey did not enable the serotypes
found at the slaughterhouse to be linked to the slaughtered
animals. It is therefore probable that strains were specific to the

184

A. Stevens et al. / International Journal of Food Microbiology 110 (2006) 178–186

slaughterhouse. S. bredeney, rare among retailers' samples, may
have been masked by other serotypes, or was less specific to the
meat or was less competitive than the serotypes found later on,
although sample variation and cross-contamination in the
slaughterhouse may have explained this variability. Indeed, in
Ireland, S. bredeney was very common in retail meat (Duffy et al.,
1999) and in poultry implicated in food poisoning (Moore et al.,
2003). Other serotypes were retailer specific (waycross, corvallis,
muenster, sendai). Some serotypes were present in all four retail
types (waycross, corvallis, and muenster). Thus one possibility is
that it could be present at slaughter without being detected or while
being hidden by other dominant serotypes. On the other hand,
other serotypes specific to some retail places could come from a
contamination at a later date (kentucky, abaetetuba, sendai, mon-
tevideo, altona, and westphalia). Most of the S. kentucky was
found in samples from the same market. Like S. bredeney in the
slaughterhouse, it could be a serotype specific to this market place.
The survey carried out among retailers highlighted poor hygiene
conditions, regarding the temperature of storage, the equipment as
well as the employees' personal hygiene. The cutting tables were
seldom washed or disinfected before use. These benches could
therefore be reservoirs from which Salmonella could spread to
other equipment
through flies or direct contact. Trades not
respecting elementary hygiene rules (markets and itinerant
salesmen), had the highest contamination rates. Two different
serotypes were found in eleven samples. If more colonies have
been picked by sample, we might have found more serotypes,
masked by dominant ones. In this work however, isolated colonies
were randomly selected among characteristic ones for confirma-
tion. The bias is therefore weak, but a different competitiveness for
each serotypes cannot be excluded. There were an interval of one
year between the samples collection at the slaughterhouse and at
retailers; we thus cannot exclude seasonal serotype variation.
However,
is notable that some serotypes were found in
equivalent proportions in 2003 and 2004. Sample collection was
carried out several times in modern butcher shops as well as at
districts retailers, whereas it was carried out only once at markets
and itinerant vendors,
these being more numerous. The
representativeness is consequently not the same, so the results
should be globally considered by trade type. An Ethiopian survey
(Molla et al., 2003) carried out at the abattoir show S. braenderup,
S. dublin, and S. saintpaul prevailed. A survey undertaken on
meats in Ireland (Duffy et al., 1999) indicated the prevalence of the
bredeney, kentucky and enteritidis serotypes. So this serotypes are
common on meat even if economical and environmental con-
ditions of Senegal and Ireland cannot be compared. Another
survey carried out in the United States (Schlosse et al., 2000)
detected montevideo, typhimurium, muenster and kentucky sero-
types' on carcasses, and montevideo, anatum, muenster and ken-
tucky in beef. The results from Senegal are unique, there is a large
geographical variety, but
the S. bredeney, S. kentucky and
S. muenster serotypes were still rather generally found.

4.2. Antibiotic resistance

In this survey, no link between resistance to antibiotics and the
serotypes was found. There is a high prevalence of resistant strains

but no strain was resistant to more than four antibiotics. Resistance
to nitrofurans was widespread. Development of nitrofuran resis-
tance can be the result of a wrong use of antibiotics in animal
husbandary. They can be used as anti-coccidia drugs. In human
medicine, they are used to treat urinary infections; therefore exis-
tence of Salmonella resistant to this type of antibiotic has a
potentially negative impact on human health. Also the small
number of multi-resistant strains indicate that the use of antibiotics
in animal husbandary remains moderate. Currently, animal rearing
with intensive antibiotic use appears to be emerging since multi-
resistant S. waycross isolates were identified in samples collected
at different retailers on the same day. The origin of the meat was not
formally identified but three of the retailers were supplied from the
same vehicle. Of the four retailer types, the samples from district
retail places had the lowest Salmonella prevalence, but the highest
proportion of multi-resistant strains. This high rate was amplified
by collection of three samples on the same day from which five
multi-resistant strains were isolated. These five strains excluded,
the multi-resistant Salmonella rate is comparable with the other
retail outlets.

In Ethiopia, Alemayehu et al. (2003) showed 52% of the
Salmonella isolated at the slaughterhouse from beef were resistant
to at least three antibiotics. In the United States, 84% of the
Salmonella isolates from retail meats were resistant to at least one
antibiotic, and 53% to at least three antibiotics. Eighteen isolates
accounting for four serotypes contained integrons coding for
resistances to the aminoglycosides, sulphonamides, trimethoprim
and betalactams (White et al., 2001). In a survey of S. muenchen,
isolated from pigs in the United States, the authors found that 75%
of the isolates were resistant to seven antibiotics and that one
human isolate was resistant to 10 antibiotics. Pulsed field analysis
did not show the strains' clonality. In vitro, the strains were able to
transfer their resistance plasmids to E. coli (Gebreyes and Thakur,
2005). Salmonella isolated from meat products in Ireland were
100% resistant to rifampicin, 92% resistant to tetracycline, 86.3%
to oxytetracycline, 86.3% to sulfamethoxazole and 80.9% to
streptomycin (Duffy et al., 1999).

By comparison, therefore, the strains isolated in Dakar showed a

low incidence of resistance.

In Senegal, the mainly extensive cattle raising system, is not a
factor in the appearance of highly multi-resistant strains. However a
minority of farms seem to be changing their practices and
producing more resistant strains. The antibiotic profiles in those
cases are beginning to resemble those observed in modern western
countries where antibiotics are widely used.

4.3. Human distribution of Salmonella serotypes

The Enterobacteria National Reference Center, located at the
Institut Pasteur de Dakar, identified, serotyped and tested the
sensitivity to antibiotics of strains sent in by various laboratories
in the Dakar area. The results published in 2003 listed the pre-
valent serotypes, among human cases between 1999 and 2003.
They were S. enteritidis (n= 196, 20.5%), S. typhi (n = 114,
11.9%) and S. typhimurium (n= 70, 7.3%). Those three serotypes
accounted for nearly 40% of the strains of human origin (Perrier-
Gros-Claude and Dromigny, 2003). S. kentucky (n = 47, 4.9%)

A. Stevens et al. / International Journal of Food Microbiology 110 (2006) 178–186

185

appeared in fourth place, S. montevideo (n = 15, 1.5%) and S.
bredeney (n = 14, 1.4%) in seventh and eighth position of the most
frequently occurring serotypes in human samples. They were also
found in this survey although in much more important proportion.
Resistance to ampicillin (19.1%), clavulanic acid–amoxicillin
(11.2%), nalidixic acid (5.6%), cotrimoxazole (17.9%), chloram-
phenicol (17.1%) and tetracycline (31.4%) was observed. These
profiles are clearly different from those of the strains isolated from
our meat samples. Food of animal origin is usually recognized as a
source of human Salmonella infection (Morris, 1996), and
Salmonella found in animals are frequently isolated from patients
(Ekperigin and Nagaraja, 1998). Nevertheless, in Dakar, the main
serotypes isolated in analyzed meats were not found in human
infections. Similar results have been found in Kenya (Kariuki
et al., 2002). Moreover, we did not observe any similarity between
resistance patterns of the strains isolated from food and those from
humans. A Brazilian survey reports the same phenomenon for
Salmonella isolated from chicken meat and from humans
(Oliveira et al., 2005). If S. kentucky, S. bredeney and S. mon-
tevideo have been found in both humans and meat, we also
demonstrated that S. bredeney was rarely found in retail meat.
Therefore, the correlation appears to be weak. Data on antibiotic
resistance of strains from humans not being available for all
strains, it was not possible to draw comparisons for S. kentucky
and S. montevideo. Finer molecular investigations are necessary
to compare these serotypes.

Serotypes occurring more frequently in these food products
may be less virulent than the less frequent ones (enteritidis,
typhimurium) (Carraminana et al., 1996). In addition, the infective
dose of serotypes causing illness is probably lower than those of
other serotypes. As we have no data about the number of
Salmonella present in samples, the risk analysis is therefore
limited. High number of Salmonella in meat products could lead
to increased exposure, resulting in relative immunity of
consumers to some serotypes (Wick, 2004). Finally, traditional
culinary practices (long cooking time of meat
in private
households) would destroy the Salmonella. Human infection
would more commonly occur after cross contamination from raw
meat to other food. It would be interesting to know whether
women, who more frequently cook and handle food, are more
often infected by Salmonella. Lastly, a high contamination rate
increases the exposure of the food chain and consumers.

5. Conclusion

This survey's main results are: (i) a very high Salmonella
prevalence in retail beef; (ii) contamination at the slaughterhouse
is amplified by poor hygiene practices and secondary contami-
nation from resident flora; (iii) a high rate of resistance to
antibiotics but a low rate of multiresistance; (iv) the emergence of
multi-resistant strains in retail beef; (v) the weak relation between
the strains isolated from beef and humans; (vi) very first data
about meat contamination by Salmonella in the sub-saharian area.
Further molecular investigations are necessary to characterize
more accurately some strains and to examine their degree of
clonality. It would also be interesting to determine the deve-
lopment capacities of some serotypes on the meat as well as their

competitiveness in comparison with others. Finally, virulence
characteristics of strains isolated both from meat and human
samples could be examined.

Though the circulation of Salmonella in the beef production
chain in Dakar is very important, to date, Salmonella strain from
this source seem to have little impact on human health. How-
ever, high prevalence of Salmonella and sporadic emergence of
multiresistant strains in beef in Dakar highlight the importance
of introducing regulations and some training about the antibiotic
use in animal husbandary before meat becomes a major source
of multi-resistant strains problematic for human health.
