Antibiotic use in animal husbandry has raised concerns on the spread of resistant bacteria. Currently animal
products are traded globally with unprecedented ease, which has been challenging the control of antimicrobial
resistance. This study aims to detect and characterize extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing
Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae from imported and locally produced poultry products sold in Ghana.
Local and imported chicken meat was collected from 94 stores and markets throughout Kumasi (Ghana) and
cultured on selective ESBL screening agar. Phenotypic ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates were
conﬁrmed by combined disc test and further characterized by antibiotic susceptibility testing, ampliﬁcation of
the blaCTX-M, blaTEM and blaSHV genes as well as multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and linked to the country of
origin.

Out of 200 meat samples, 71 (36%) samples revealed 81 ESBL-producing isolates (46 E. coli and 35 K.
pneumoniae), with 44% (30/68) of local poultry and 31% (41/132) of imported products being contaminated.
Most ESBL-producing isolates harboured the blaCTX-M-15 gene (61/81, 75%) and the dominant Sequence Types
(ST) were ST2570 (7/35, 20%) among K. pneumoniae and ST10 (5/46, 11%) among E. coli.

High numbers of ESBL-producing bacteria, particularly on local but also imported poultry meat, represent a
potential source for human colonization and infection as well as spread within the community. Surveillance
along the poultry production-food-consumer chain would be a valuable tool to identify sources of emerging
multidrug resistant pathogens in Ghana.

1. Background

The use of antimicrobial drugs in animal husbandry for the treat-
ment and prevention of infectious diseases or as growth promoters have
contributed to the spread of multidrug resistant bacteria (Chantziaras
et al., 2014). As common causes of nosocomial and community infec-
tions among humans, multidrug resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella
pneumoniae are of particular interest (Mathers et al., 2015). Worryingly,
prevalence rates for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)/AmpC-
producing E. coli in poultry meat have exceeded 90% in industrialized
countries such as France, the Netherlands and Spain (Leverstein-van
Hall et al., 2011; Egea et al., 2012; Casella et al., 2017).

There is increasing evidence for the transmission of ESBL genes,
plasmids and E. coli isolates from poultry to humans, most likely

through the food chain (Leverstein-van Hall et al., 2011). Other studies
have shown that ESBL-producing E. coli causing extraintestinal infec-
tions in humans originated from meat products, particularly poultry
(Lazarus et al., 2014). Consequently, the European Food Safety Au-
thority (EFSA) declared the presence of ESBL-producing E. coli in
poultry meat a signiﬁcant hazard to public health (EFSA, 2012) and
jointly, the EFSA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recently
advocated measures to reduce antimicrobial agents in animal hus-
bandry in the European Union (Murphy et al., 2017).

In contrast to industrialized countries, the extent of poultry meat
contamination with ESBL-producing E. coli in Sub-Saharan Africa is not
suﬃciently monitored and the use of antimicrobials remains largely
unregulated (Maron et al., 2013). Apart from inappropriate drug ap-
plications without prescriptions, antimicrobial use

promotion has been regarded as a major problem (Okeke et al., 1999;
Adzitey, 2013; Van Boeckel et al., 2015). Despite this, recent studies
from Sub-Saharan Africa found only 11% of Ghanaian and no Nigerian
poultry samples to be contaminated with ESBL-producing E. coli
(Rasmussen et al., 2015; Ojo et al., 2016). Imported poultry meat from
industrialized countries may therefore rather be contributing to the
spread of ESBL-producing bacteria within Sub-Saharan Africa, as pro-
posed by studies from Gabon and Ghana (Schaumburg et al., 2014;
Rasmussen et al., 2015). The signiﬁcance of the poultry trade for the
international dissemination of antimicrobial resistances has been illu-
strated not only for the transmission of ESBL-producing bacteria, but
also just recently for mcr-1-mediated colistin resistance (Dhanji et al.,
2010; Grami et al., 2016). With poultry products being traded globally
with unprecedented ease, the control of antimicrobial resistance is
challenging, in particular in Sub-Saharan Africa, where surveillance
systems do not exist.

This study aims to characterize and compare ESBL-producing E. coli
and K. pneumoniae from imported and locally produced poultry pro-
ducts sold in Ghana in order to identify potential sources for the
emergence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria.

2. Methods

2.1. Study site and sampling procedure

The study was conducted from May to December 2015 in Kumasi,
with roughly 2.5 million inhabitants the second largest city in Ghana
and the capital of the Ashanti region. Throughout the city 75 super-
markets, selling imported frozen poultry meat, were identiﬁed (Fig. 1,
blue location marks). Each supermarket was visited once during the
study period. One piece of frozen poultry meat was purchased in each
store. In case stores sold meat imported from diﬀerent countries, one
piece from each country was acquired. The origin of the imported meat
was retrieved from the packaging. Local Ghanaian poultry meat was
purchased from 19 diﬀerent open markets, where each trader was
visited only once (Fig.1, red location marks). Approximately 15 g of
each meat sample were immediately put into sterile homogenizer bags
and kept refrigerated during transport to the laboratory.

2.2. ESBL detection and antibiotic susceptibility testing

On arrival in the laboratory, the sample was homogenized with a
pestle and incubated overnight in 100 mL of Brain Heart Infusion (BHI)

broth. 100 μL were then plated onto two selective MacConkey agar
plates containing 1 mg/L ceftazidime and 1 mg/L cefotaxime. All mor-
phologically diﬀerent colonies (never exceeding four colonies) were
identiﬁed biochemically using the analytical proﬁle index test (API 20E,
bioMérieux, Marcy L’Etoile, France) and conﬁrmed by MALDI-TOF
mass spectrometry (Bruker, Billerica, USA). For all E. coli and K.
pneumoniae isolates ESBL production was conﬁrmed by the combined
disk test using cefotaxime and ceftazidime alone and in combination
with clavulanic acid (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD,
USA) as described before by the European Committee on Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST, the EUCAST guideline on detection of
resistance mechanisms v 1.0 (2013-12-11)).

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed with the VITEK 2
system using AST-N111 cards (bioMérieux, Marcy L’Etoile, France) for
imipenem, meropenem, gentamicin, cipro-
cefotaxime, ceftazidime,
ﬂoxacin
(cotrimoxazole).
Breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae were applied according to the 2016
EUCAST guidelines (http://www.eucast.org).

2.3. ESBL genotyping and multilocus sequence typing (MLST)

All isolates with ESBL phenotypes were screened for the presence of
the blaCTX-M, blaTEM and blaSHV genes by Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR) and subsequent sequencing, as described before (Belmar Campos
et al., 2014). Group speciﬁc primers were used for ampliﬁcation and
sequencing to further distinguish blaCTX-M positive isolates (Belmar
Campos et al., 2014). The resulting sequences were identiﬁed by
comparison with known sequences using the NCBI BLAST (http://blast.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and the Lahey Clinic Database (http://www.la-
hey.org/studies/). MLST was conducted for all ESBL-producing E. coli
and K. pneumoniae isolates according to previously published 7-loci
protocols (Diancourt et al., 2005; Wirth et al., 2006).

2.4. Epidemiological analysis

Categorical variables were described as frequencies and percen-
tages. The association of ESBL positivity with meat import was calcu-
lated using the prevalence ratio (PR) along with the 95%-conﬁdence
interval (CI). All data analyses were performed with Stata 14 (StataCorp
LP, College Station, USA). The map was created with R statistical
software (https://www.R-project.org/) using the osmar package
(Eugster and Schlesinger et al., 2012). Data for the Kumasi map (Fig. 1)
was retrieved from https://www.openstreetmap.org.

3. Results

A total of 200 meat samples, consisting of 68 samples from local
Ghanaian poultry and 132 samples from imported poultry meat, were
collected from open markets and supermarkets across Kumasi (Fig. 1).
The majority of imported meat samples originated from the Nether-
lands (n = 38; 29%), Brazil (n = 31; 23%) and the United States
(n = 31; 23%) (Fig. 2). Imported poultry meat from Belgium (n = 8),
Germany (n = 3) Poland (n = 3), Ireland (n = 2) and Turkey (n = 1)
was less commonly purchased. For 15 imported products the country of
origin could not be identiﬁed.

Among the 200 meat samples, 71 (36%) were screened positive for
ESBL-producing bacteria, with 46 E. coli and 35 K. pneumoniae isolates
being detected. Nine meat samples were positive with both species, and
one sample revealed two diﬀerent K. pneumoniae isolates. With 44%
(n = 30) of Ghanaian meat samples and 31% (n = 41) of imported
meat samples being contaminated with ESBL-producing bacteria, no
clear diﬀerence between those two sampling groups was detected (PR
0.81, 95% CI 0.64–1.03), although country-speciﬁc prevalences varied
slightly. Looking at meat-exporting countries from which more than
ﬁve samples have been collected, the highest ESBL rates were detected
in Belgian (n = 7/8; 88%), Brazilian (n = 10/31; 32%) and Dutch

(n = 10/38; 26%) meat products (Fig. 2).

The most frequently identiﬁed ESBL genotype was CTX-M-15, with
67% of E. coli (31/46) and 86% of K. pneumoniae (30/35) isolates
harbouring blaCTX-M-15 (Table 1). CTX-M-15 was followed in frequency
by CTX-M-1 (11%; 5/46) and CTX-M-2 (9%; 4/46) genotypes among E.
coli and CTX-M-14 (6%; 2/35) and SHV-12 (6%; 2/35) genotypes
among K. pneumoniae (Table 1).

Concomitant resistance to ciproﬂoxacin was detected in 56 of the 81
ESBL-producing isolates (69%) distributed to 59% of E. coli and 83% of
K. pneumoniae isolates. In comparison to E. coli, K. pneumoniae isolates
also revealed higher resistance rates for the antibiotics gentamicin
(13% vs. 49%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (72% vs. 91%). All
tested isolates were susceptible to carbapenems (Table 1).

MLST analysis revealed high strain diversity with 22 and 32 dif-
ferent sequence types (ST) detected in K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolates,
respectively. The most frequent STs in K. pneumoniae were ST2570
(n = 7; 20%), ST147 (n = 3; 9%) and ST15 (n = 3; 9%), which com-
prise 65% of all Ghanaian Klebsiella isolates. One Klebsiella isolate
presented with a new allele (pgi allele 182) and two other isolates re-
vealed a new allele proﬁle, which could not be allocated to any known
ST. These strains were assigned the new ST numbers ST2734, ST2741
and ST2956 in the K. pneumoniae MLST database (http://bigsdb.
pasteur.fr/klebsiella/klebsiella.html). Among E. coli ST10 (n = 5;
11%), ST38 (n = 3; 7%) and ST155 (n = 3; 7%) predominated. Based
on the MLST analysis no ST clusters could be attributed to any speciﬁc
importing country (Table 2).

4. Discussion

The study results demonstrate high contamination rates with ESBL-
producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae for local Ghanaian (44%) and
imported poultry meat (31%). A previous study from Ghana found

signiﬁcantly less ESBL bacteria among local poultry (11%) compared to
imports (21%) from Brazil and the United States, suggesting the inter-
national food trade as an important source for the spread of multidrug
resistant bacteria (Rasmussen et al., 2015). With an even higher ESBL
rate among international poultry products, the present study apparently
reinforces this hypothesis. However, in contrast to other studies, the
results presented here show that ESBL contamination of local meat
exceeds that of most importing countries. Considering the variable
ESBL prevalences from each country, it might be misleading to hold the
international poultry trade in general responsible for introducing ESBL-
carrying bacteria into Ghana. Instead rather country-speciﬁc data
should be monitored. According to United Nations data (https://
comtrade.un.org) the USA, Belgium, Brazil and the Netherlands are
the main poultry meat importers, having contributed to 66% of poultry
imports to Ghana in 2016 and comprising 82% of imported specimens
in this sample collection. The high ESBL rate from Belgium meat sam-
ples is particularly alarming. Previously, not only on-farm antimicrobial

therapy, such as oﬀ-label ceftiofur use until 2010 (Dierikx et al., 2013),
but also management factors, such as hygienic conditions and feeding
procedures, have been considered responsible for the emergence of
multidrug resistant bacteria on Belgian farms (Persoons et al., 2011). A
study from France suggested that even ﬁve years after a drastic re-
duction of ceftiofur use, high ESBL prevalences were still detectable in
farm animals (Casella et al., 2017).

Equally worrying are the high ESBL rates among local poultry. So
far two studies from West Africa have investigated the contamination of
poultry meat with ESBL E. coli, with 0% (sample size: n = 116) detected
in Nigeria between 2008 and 2014 and 11% (sample size: n = 36) in
Ghana in 2015 (Rasmussen et al., 2015; Ojo et al., 2016). Hence, the
41% of ESBL-producing E. coli found in the present study may indicate
an increasing trend, however proportions are still lower than reported
from European countries, such as Spain (93%) or the Netherlands
(80%) (Overdevest et al., 2011; Egea et al., 2012). The easy, un-
regulated access and inappropriate use of antibiotics has recently been
suggested to contribute to increasing antimicrobial resistance in Ghana
(Yevutsey et al., 2017). This alarming development should encourage
Ghanaian policy makers and public health authorities to enforce reg-
ulations on food hygiene and use of antibiotics, as proposed before
(Annan-Prah et al., 2012).

As one of the globally predominant STs in the poultry population,
ST10 is the most frequently detected ST among E. coli isolates (Huijbers
et al., 2014; Rasmussen et al., 2015; Ojo et al., 2016). Only one E. coli
isolate from Brazil belonged to ST131, the ST responsible for an esti-
mated 40–80% of extra-intestinal infections with ESBL-producing E. coli
worldwide (Nicolas-Chanoine et al., 2014). Among K. pneumoniae,
ST2570 is most prevalent with six isolates from Ghanaian and one
isolate from imported meat (United States). To the authors’ knowledge
ST2570 has never been isolated in poultry or patients from Sub-Saharan
Africa before, but due to insuﬃcient data from this region its relevance
is diﬃcult to determine. Due to the high diversity of STs and the rela-
tively low case number for each country, the phylogenetic analysis is
not able to identify any country-speciﬁc ST clusters.

CTX-M-15 is the most prevalent ESBL genotype among E. coli and K.
pneumoniae in this study, similar to what has been previously reported
for poultry meat and faecal samples from West Africa (Rasmussen et al.,
2015; Ojo et al., 2016). Interestingly, all the Dutch isolates harboured
the blaCTX-M-15 gene, although studies from the Netherlands show a
predominance of blaCTX-M-1 among retail poultry meat (Leverstein-van
Hall et al., 2011; Overdevest et al., 2011). This ﬁnding could be ex-
plained by changing epidemiological patterns, but also by the

complexity in tracing back an isolate to a deﬁnite animal, environ-
mental or human source. Local as well as imported poultry could have
been contaminated at all stages of the food processing chain including
processing, packing and distribution, a factor requiring consideration
when attributing a geographical source to isolates. Nevertheless, re-
gardless of a contaminating source, ESBL-producing bacteria on poultry
meat may represent a risk for the end consumer, eventually leading to
the colonization of the intestinal tract or severe infections (Lazarus
et al., 2014).

Highly relevant for clinical practice is the substantial number of
isolates with coexisting ESBL production and resistance to trimetho-
prim/sulfamethoxazole (80%) or ciproﬂoxacin (69%) in this study. A
recent meta-analysis from Tanzania revealed very similar co-resistance
numbers in animal samples and several studies have demonstrated the
coexistence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) and
ESBL genes on the same plasmid (Strahilevitz et al., 2009; Fortini et al.,
2011; Seni et al., 2017). This study however, does not allow any con-
clusions on a potential linkage of diﬀerent plasmid-mediated resistance
genes. Nevertheless, this issue needs to be addressed in future studies,
as those multidrug resistant strains may spread rapidly under antibiotic-
speciﬁc selective pressure and would drastically reduce the already
limited spectrum of available antibiotics for severe infections in the
Sub-Saharan region (Eibach et al., 2016). If transmission of antibiotic
resistance between poultry and human reservoirs is driven mainly by
the spread of plasmids, as suggested previously, the importance of the
bacteria’s genetic background, including STs, may be negligible (de
Been et al., 2014).

5. Conclusion

High numbers of ESBL-producing bacteria, particularly on local but
also imported poultry meat, represent a potential source for human
exposure. Spread within the community might lead to severe infections
with multidrug resistant bacteria for which no antibiotic treatment is
available in Ghana. In order to monitor the sources of emerging mul-
tidrug resistant pathogens, surveillance along the poultry production-
food-consumer chain, integrating animal and human health, should be
implemented. Surveillance activities should be combined with a more
stringently regulated use of antibiotics on local poultry farms and in-
creased awareness of
the population.
Internationally, advocacy for a reduction of antimicrobial drug use in
animal husbandry must be reinforced.
