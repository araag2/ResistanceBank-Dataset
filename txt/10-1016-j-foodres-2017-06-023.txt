This study addressed the occurrence of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. in 
bovine  carcasses  at  two  slaughterhouses  in  southern  Brazil.  Then,  the  antimicrobial 
susceptibility  profile  and  the  virulence  potential  of  the  isolates  were  evaluated.  Two 
hundred  carcasses  were  sampled  at  four  steps  of  the  slaughter  process,  with  L. 
monocytogenes  being  isolated  in  12  and  Salmonella  spp.  in  17  carcasses.  All  L. 
monocytogenes  isolates  carried  the  hlyA,  prfA,  plcA,  plcB,  actA,  iap,  mpl,  inlA,  inlB, 
inlC,  and  inlJ  genes,  while  Salmonella  spp.  carried  invA  and  hilA.  Among  the  L. 
monocytogenes  isolates,  all  of  them  presented  virulence  determinants  and  one  showed 
multi-drug  resistance.  In  relationship  to  Salmonella  spp.  isolates,  many  serogroups 
frequently  related  to  outbreaks  of  foodborne  diseases  were  identified  and  four  isolates 
showed  resistance  to  more  than  one  antimicrobial  agent.  This  data  highlights  the 
importance  of  a  rigid  hygienic-sanitary  control  during  the  slaughter  process  to  reduce 
the risk of cross-contamination and lower the consumer exposure to  L. monocytogenes 
and Salmonella spp. infections.

 1 Introduction 

ABSTRACT 

The  bacterial  contamination  of  beef  is  facilitated  in  several  stages  of  the 

slaughter process, for example during skinning, evisceration and pre-cooling, which are

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

 

the  main  steps  where  contamination  needs  to  be  controlled  (Gill,  Bryant,  &  Landers, 

2003;  Pointon,  Kiermeier,  &  Fegan,  2012).  In  addition,  surfaces  within  the  industrial 

plants  and  of  transport  means  of  the  animals  can  have  an  influence  on  carcass 

contamination (Nørrung & Buncic, 2008). 

According to the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MS - Ministry of Health, 2014), 

products  of  animal  origin  are  the  main  cause  for  foodborne  diseases  (FBD)  and 

prevention depends mainly on the microbiological  quality of the raw material. Among 

the  pathogenic  microorganisms  that  can  contaminate  beef  cattle  are  Salmonella  spp., 

Listeria  monocytogenes,  Shiga  toxin-producing  Escherichia  coli  and  Campylobacter 

spp., which have been frequently involved in cases and outbreaks of FBD (Antic et al.,

resistance in foodborne strains has been reported. This is an important aspect related to 

foodborne diseases which, together with the different virulence factors and mechanisms 

of  pathogenicity  of  bacteria,  makes  difficult  to  control  these  diseases  (Conter  et  al., 

2009;  Granier  et  al.,  2011;  Haubert,  Mendonça,  Lopes,  Cardoso,  &  Silva,  2015; 

In  the  last  decades  an  overall  increase  in  the  incidence  of  antimicrobial 

2010). 

Kovacevic, Sagert, Wozniak, Gilmour, & Allen, 2013). 

Considering this, the purpose of this study was therefore to assess the occurrence 

of L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. in bovine carcasses at two slaughterhouses in 

southern Brazil, as well as an evaluation of the antimicrobial susceptibility profile and 

the phenotypic and genotypic characterization of the virulence potential of the isolates. 

2 Material and Methods 

2.1. Sampling 

Two hundred bovine carcasses were sampled in  2 slaughterhouses at 4 steps of 

the  slaughter  process  (step  1  -  after  bleeding,  step  2  -  after  skinning,  step  3  -  after

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

 

evisceration,  and  step  4  -  after  pre-cooling  washing),  totaling  800  samples.  All  the 

animals analyzed were males and belonged to different breed of European origin. Both 

slaughterhouses receive animals from all southern regions of the state of Rio Grande do 

Sul, Brazil. The slaughterhouse A (SH-A) has a daily slaughter capacity of 150 head of 

cattle, on average, while the slaughterhouse B (SH-B) slaughter 650 cattle per day. Of 

these 800 samples, 452  were  collected in  SH-A  and 348 in  SH-B.  The  carcasses  were 

sampled  according  to  the  recommendations  in  force  of  the  European  Community  - 

Commission Regulation EC (2007), using the surface swab technique (hides – sampling 

step 1, and carcasses - sampling steps 2, 3 and 4). Each carcass was sampled with a set 

of 4 previously moistened 3M™ sponges (3M Microbiology, St. Paul, MN, USA), and 

each sponge was applied in an area of 100 cm2, resulting in a total sampled area of 400 

cm2  (Andrews  and  Hammack,  1998).  The  swab  was  performed  in  the  region  of  the 

animal  chest  of  the  carcasses  (sampling  steps  1  and  2)  and  half  carcasses  (sampling 

steps 3 and 4).

Thereafter,  200  mL  of  buffered  peptone  (1%)  saline  (0.85%)  solution  (BPS, 

Oxoid  Ltd.,  Basingstoke, England) was  added to  each sponge set.  A 40 mL  aliquot  of 

each  sample  from  the  carcass  surfaces  was  transferred  to  Falcon  tubes,  which  were 

centrifuged  at  1000  x  g  for  15  min,  at  5  °C  (Eppendorf  5430  R).  The  resulting 

supernatant  was  discarded  and  the  pellets  were  used  to  evaluate  the  presence  of  L. 

monocytogenes and Salmonella spp..  

2.2 Isolation and identification of L. monocytogenes 

L.  monocytogenes  was  isolated  and  identified  according  to  the  methods 

described  by  the  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO  11290-1).  After 

centrifugation,  the  pellet  was  suspended  in  10  mL  half  Fraser  broth  (Oxoid  Ltd., 

Basingstoke, England), followed by incubation at 30 °C ±2 for 24 h (Solab, B.O.D SL –

200/364).  After  the  incubation  period,  0.1  mL  of  each  culture  was  transferred  to  test 

tubes  containing  10  mL  of  Fraser  broth  (Oxoid  Ltd.,  Basingstoke,  England),  and 

incubated  at  37  °C  ±2  for  48  h  (Solab,  B.O.D  SL  –  200/364).  Later,  inoculation  was 

carried  out  on  Oxford  (Oxoid  Ltd.,  Basingstoke,  England)  and  Chromogenic  Listeria 

agar  (Oxoid  Ltd.,  Basingstoke, England), which were incubated at  37  °C ±2   for 48 h 

(Solab,  B.O.D  SL  –  200/364).  Typical  Listeria  spp.  colonies  were  selected  and 

inoculated  on  Tryptone-Soy  agar  (TSA,  Oxoid  Ltd.,  Basingstoke,  England)  enriched 

with  0.6%  yeast  extract  (YE,  Himedia  Laboratories  Pvt.  Ltd.,  Mumbai,  India)  (TSA-

YE) and incubated at 37 °C ±2 for 24 h (Solab, B.O.D SL – 200/364). Then they were

Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO  6579:2002),  with  modifications.  After 

centrifugation,  the  pellet  was  subject  to  selective  enrichment  in    10  mL  of  Muller-

Kauffmann  Tetrathionate  broth  with  novobiocin  (MKTTn,  Oxoid  Ltd.,  Basingstoke, 

England)  and  10  mL  of  Rappaport-Vassiliadis  broth  with  soybean  (RVS,  Oxoid  Ltd., 

Basingstoke, England), and the respective tubes incubated for 24 h at 37 °C ±2 (Solab, 

B.O.D  SL  –  200/364)  and  41.5  °C  ±2  (Quimib,  Mod.  0215M2).  Thereafter,  two  

selective  media  were  used:  Xylose  Lysine  Deoxycholate  agar  (XLD,  Oxoid  Ltd., 

Basingstoke, England) and Mannitol Lysine Crystal Bright Green Violet  agar (MLCB, 

Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, England), incubated at 37 ºC ±2  for 24 h (Solab, B.O.D SL – 

200/364). The colonies with typical characteristics of Salmonella spp. were subjected to

phenotypic confirmation on triple-sugar-iron agar (TSI,  Acumedia Manufacturers,  Inc. 

Lansing,  Michigan),  Lysine-Iron  agar  (LIA,  Acumedia  Manufacturers,  Inc.  Lansing, 

Michigan) and Urea broth (Labsynth Ltd., São Paulo), incubated at 37 °C ±2  for 24 h  

(Solab, B.O.D SL – 200/364). 

The isolates with typical Salmonella spp. reactions in the phenotypic tests were 

subjected  to  serology  tests  with  somatic  polyvalent  anti-Salmonella  serum  (Probac, 

Brazil) and flagellar polyvalent anti-Salmonella serum (Probac, Brazil). In all analyses, 

the Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 14028 strain was used as positive control. 

Genomic  DNA  was  extracted  according  to  the  protocol  recommended  by 

Green & Sambrook (2012) with minor adaptations.

2.4.2 Detection of virulence genes by PCR assay  

After  confirmation  of  Listeria  genus  by  the  presence  of  prs  gene  and  of  L. 

monocytogenes  by  the  presence  of  inlA  gene,  the  isolates  were  subjected  to  molecular 

serogrouping  identification  by  the  presence  of  lmo1118,  lmo0737,  ORF2110  and 

ORF2819 genes.  The other species of Listeria were phenotypically identified. 

The  virulence  of  L.  monocytogenes  isolates  was  characterized  based  on  the 

presence  of  LIPI-1  (hlyA,  prfA,  plcA,  plcB,  actA,  mpl),  iap,  inlA,  inlB,  inlC,  and  inlJ 

genes.  The  pfrA  gene  is  a  central  virulence  regulator.  The  iap  (encoding  the  invasion- 

associated  protein)  and  actA  (encoding  the  surface  actin  polymerisation  protein  actA) 

genes are required for invasiveness and hlyA (encoding a haemolysin) is responsible for 

hemolytic  activity  of  L.  monocytogenes.  The  plcA  (encoding  phosphatidylinositol 

phospholipase-C  (PI-PLC))  and  plcB  (phosphatidycholine  phospholipase-C)  genes  are 

required  for  primary  and  secondary  vacuole  lysis  during  the  infection.    The  mpl 

 

5

(encoding  the  metalloprotease)  gene  is  involved  in  the  PI-PLC  activation  in  the  new 

cycle  of  infection.  Finally,  the  internalin  genes  (inlA,  inlB,  inlC,  and inlJ),  encoding  a 

inlA,  inlB,  inlC  and  inlJ  proteins,  are  involved  in  cell  invasion  and  in  post-intestinal 

infection. 

 For  the  Salmonella  isolates,  the  presence  of  hilA,  pefA,  invA,  sefA,  and  spvC 

genes  was  evaluated.  The  hilA  (Hyper  Invasibility)  gene  is  located  in  a  highly 

conserved  genome  region  of  Salmonella  spp.  and  is  required  to  regulate  cell  invasion 

and  macrophage  apoptosis.  The  invA  gene  is  required  to  increase  the  capacity  of 

invasion of Salmonella in epithelial cells. The spvC (Salmonella Plasmid Virulence) gene 

is  responsible  for  systemic  spread  of  the  pathogen.  Finally,  the  sefA  and  pefA  genes  are 

involved,  respectively,  in  fimbria  expression  and  cell  adhesion.    The  oligonucleotide 

sequences and references used in this study are shown in Table 1. In all analyses, the L.

monocytogenes ATCC 7644  strain was used as positive control.  

PCR  assays  were  performed  using  a  final  volume  of  25  μL  using  12.5  μL 

Gotaq®  Green  Master  Mix  (Promega®),  10  pmol  of  each  primer  and  10  ng  DNA 

template. A reaction mixture without DNA template was included as a negative control 

for each primer. The isolates of L. monocytogenes were subjected to PCR for molecular 

serogrouping  identification  according  to  Doumith,  Buchrieser,  Glaser,  Jacquet,  & 

Martin (2004), under the following conditions: 3 min at 94 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 

94 °C for 40 sec, 53 °C for 1.15 min, and 72 °C for 1.15 min, with a final cycle at 72 °C 

for 7 min (Bioer, Life Express Thermal Cycler TC-96/G/H(b)). 

For  the  internalin  genes  (inlA,  inlB,  inlC,  and  inlJ),  initial  denaturation  was 

performed at 94 °C for 2 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 20 and 72 °C for 50 

s, followed by a final  extension at  72 °C for 2 min.  For the  prfA, plcA, hlyA, iap, and 

actA genes, initial  denaturation was performed at  95 °C for 2 min,  35 cycles of 95 °C

for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min and 30 s, followed by a final extension at 

72 °C for 10 min. For the mpl and plcB genes, initial denaturation was used at 94 °C for 

3 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, with a final 

extension at 72 °C for 5 min (Bioer, Life Express Thermal Cycler TC-96/G/H(b)). 

For  the  Salmonella  isolates,  the  PCR  program  consisted,  for  the  hilA  gene,  of 

initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 63 °C 

for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. For the 

pefA, invA, sefA, and spvC genes, initial denaturation at 94 ºC for 2 min followed by 35 

cycles of 94 ºC for 30 s, 53 ºC for 45 and 72 ºC for 1 min, with  a final extension at 72 

°C for 7 min (Bioer, Life Express Thermal Cycler TC-96/G/H(b)). 

The  PCR  products  were  submitted  to  electrophoresis  on  1.5%  agarose  gel 

(Invitrogen®)  with  a  1Kb  molecular  weight  marker  (Invitrogen®).  The  amplification 

products were visualized under UV light in a transilluminator (Loccus®, L-Pix Touch).

3.1 Occurrence of L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. in bovine carcasses 

The  occurrence  of  L.  monocytogenes  in  bovine  carcasses  was  6%  (12/200), 

being 7 isolates (L99, L106, L108, L109, L110, L130, and L159) detected at step 1 and 

5  (L17,  L18,  L97,  L152,  and  L154)  at  step  4.  Of  these,  only  L130  was  isolated  from 

SH-B.  In  relation  to  serogroups,  the  12  isolates  belong  to  the  lineages  I  and  II, 

represented, respectively, by the serotypes 4b, 4d or 4e and 1/2c or 3c (Table 2).  

Aside  from  contamination  by  L.  monocytogenes,  22.5%  (45/200)  of  the 

carcasses were contaminated by L. innocua. Of these, 40% (18/45) from SH-A (17 from 

step 1 and 1 from step 3) and 60% (27/45) from  SH-B (16 from step 1, 1 from step 3 

and 10 from step 4). Moreover, L. grayi (1/200) was isolated at step 3 in SH-A and L.

Of  the  200  sampled  carcasses,  8%  (16/200)  presented  contamination  by 

Salmonella  spp.,  of  which  10  isolates  (S338,  S340,  S359,  S360,  S560,  S566,  S572, 

S574, S577, and S582) were detected in the slaughterhouses SH-A and six (S307, S612, 

S618, S639, S634, and S654) in SH-B, all at step 1 of the slaughter line. Eight serovars 

were identified, with prevalence of S. Senftenberg (43.7%), followed by S. Muenster, S.

The  expected  fragments  of  the  hilA  and  invA  genes,  used  for  confirmation  of 

Salmonella at the genus level, were amplified in all isolates. However, the fragments of 

the spvC, sefA and pefA genes were not amplified. 

The  L.  monocytogenes  isolates  were  resistant  to  gentamicin  (1/12),  kanamycin 

(1/12)  and  sulfonamides  (10/12).  Intermediate  resistance  was  observed  against 

clindamycin (7/12) and erythromycin (1/12). Isolate L18 was resistant to four classes of 

antimicrobials (gentamicin, erythromycin, sulfonamides, and kanamycin) and classified 

as multi-drug resistant. 

All  Salmonella  spp.  isolates  were  susceptible  to  cefotaxime,  imipenem, 

chloramphenicol,  amikacin,  gentamicin,  nalidixic  acid,  ciprofloxacin,  trimethoprim-

sulfamethoxazole, and to kanamycin. Four isolates showed resistance to more than one 

antimicrobial  agent.  S.  Derby  showed  resistance  to  the  antimicrobials  tetracycline  and 

sulfonamides,  whereas  an  isolate  of  S.  Enterica  (O:6.7)  and  all  S.  Anatum  isolates 

presented  resistance  to  ampicillin,  cefoxitin  and  cephalothin.  Only  one  S.  Anatum 

isolate was moderately resistant to streptomycin. 

4 Discussion 

Carcass  contamination  in  slaughterhouses  can  occur  at  various  steps  along  the 

slaughter  line,  through  the  feces,  hair  and  intestinal  tract  of  the  animals,  as  well  as 

through  handling,  surfaces  and  equipment.  The  identification  and  monitoring  of  these 

steps are extremely important for public health for underlying the definition of adequate 

control measures, minimizing the presence of pathogens such as L. monocytogenes and 

Salmonella spp. in beef. 

The occurrence of L. monocytogenes in bovine carcasses at two slaughterhouses 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

in the southern region of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, was 6% (12/200). This 

result  is  close  to  that  found  by  Loiko  et  al.  (2016)  in  the  central  region  of  the  same 

Brazilian  state,  who  found  this  microorganism  in  6.48%  (7/108)  of  the  carcasses. 

However,  Camargo  et  al.  (2014)  found  a  low  incidence  of  L.  monocytogenes  (0.95%) 

when  evaluating  209  bovine  carcasses  in  slaughterhouses  in  the  Minas  Gerais  state, 

Eight-five percent (17/200) of the carcasses were positive for Salmonella spp., as 

similarly  reported  by  Cossi  et  al.  (2014),  who  detected  Salmonella  spp.  in  9.6% 

(20/209)  of  the  evaluated  carcasses  in  Minas  Gerais  state,  Brazil.  On  the  other  hand, 

Loiko  et  al.  (2016)  isolated  Salmonella  spp.  in  only  0.93%  (1/108)  of  the  evaluated 

carcasses in Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil.

The occurrence of L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. on animal hides after 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

 

Four critical steps of the slaughter line at two slaughterhouses were evaluated in 

this  study.  L.  monocytogenes  and  Salmonella  spp.  were  isolated  at  step  1  (after 

bleeding)  and  just  L.  monocytogenes  at  step  4  (after  the  final  wash).  Salmonella  spp. 

was  only  isolated  at  step  1,  where  10  isolates  (S338,  S340,  S359,  S360,  S560,  S566, 

S572,  S574,  S577,  and  S582)  from  SH-A  and  6  (S307,  S612,  S618,  S639,  S634,  and 

S654) from  SH-B were  found.  Seven isolates of  L. monocytogenes  (L99,  L108,  L108, 

L109,  L110,  L130,  and  L159)  were  obtained  at  step  1  and  5  isolates  (L17,  L18,  L97,

immediately  before  cooling  was  5%,  which  is  a  concern  because,  due  to  its 

psychotrophic  characteristic,  this  pathogen  can  multiply  during  storage  in  the  cold 

chamber  (Sofos  &  Geornaras,  2010).  Similar  results  were  obtained  by  Guerini  et  al. 

(2007) in the United States of America, as well as by Camargo et al. (2014) and Loiko 

et  al.  (2016)  in  Brazil,  who  have  also  found  L.  monocytogenes  in  bovine  carcasses 

It  is  noteworthy  that  the  occurrence  of  L.  monocytogenes  in  the  carcass 

bleeding (step 1) was 3.5% (7/200) and 8.5% (17/200), respectively, demonstrating that 

animal  hides are  an important  vehicle of pathogen introduction into the slaughter line. 

After  their  entry,  these  microorganisms  can  adhere  and  persist  in  the  slaughter 

environment,  promoting  recurrent  contamination  in  the  carcass  throughout  its 

processing (de Oliveira, Brugnera, Alves, & Piccoli, 2010). 

L152, and L154) at step 4, of which only isolate L130 was from SH-B.  

before cold storage.  

The identity of L. monocytogenes isolates (n=12) evaluated by phenotypic tests 

was confirmed by PCR, targeting the species-specific inlA gene. The evaluation of the 

virulence potential  of the  isolates was  based on  the presence of  internalin genes (inlA, 

inlB,  inlC,  and  inlJ),  of  the  genes  present  in  LIPI-1  (prfA,  plcA,  hlyA,  mpl,  actA,  and

plcB) and of the iap gene. The 12 isolates carried the genes inlA, inlB, inlC and inlJ, as 

also observed in previous studies (Camargo et al.,2014; Gelbíčová & Karpíšková, 2012; 

(Indrawattana et al., 2011; Jamali, Radmehr, & Thong, 2013; Liu, Lawrence, Austin, & 

Ainsworth,  2007;  Lomonaco,  Patti,  Knabel,  &  Civera,  2012;  Mammina  et  al.,  2009; 

Sant’Ana,  Igarashi,  Landgraf,  Destro,  &  Franco,  2012).  The  inlA  gene  encodes  a 

product that is responsible for the entry of the bacterium into the host cell and the genes 

inlB, inlC and inlJ are directly involved in the subsequent infection stages (Doumith et 

al.,  2004;  Liu  et  al.,  2007).  The  detection  of  the  inlC  and  inlJ  genes  is  an  important 

result,  since  Liu  et  al.  (2007)  reported  the  absence  of  these  genes  in  non-pathogenic 

isolates. 

The  genes  located  in  LIPI-1  are  related  with  many  steps  of  L.  monocytogenes 

infection, as well as the  iap gene, which has an indirect  function in  their pathogenesis 

(Vázquez-boland  et  al.,  2001)  codifying  a  product  that  is  responsible  for  entering  the 

host cell. These genes were detected in  all  L. monocytogenes isolates, suggesting their 

virulence  potential  (Bueno  et  al.,  2010;  Camargo  et  al.,  2014;  Jaradat,  Schutze,  &

Bhunia, 2002; Moreno et al., 2012). 

Salmonella  Senftenberg  was  the  most  prevalent  serovar  (43.7%)  among  the 

isolates,  followed  by  S.  Muenster,  S.  Anatum  and  S.  Enterica  (12.5%  each).  The  least 

prevalent  serovars  were  S.  Ohio,  S.  Derby,  S.  Livingstone,  and  S.  Diarizonae  (6,2% 

each). Studies in other countries, such as those of Stevens et al. (2008) and Ghafir et al. 

(2005) detected S. Muenster and S. Enteritidis as the most prevalent serovars in bovine 

carcasses and meat, respectively. 

All  Salmonella  isolates  (17)  carried  the  hilA  gene,  responsible  for  macrophage 

invasion  and  apoptosis,  and  the  invA  gene,  used  as  standard  for  Salmonella  spp. 

identification. However, none carried the sefA, pefA and spvC genes involved in fimbria

expression (Porwolik and McClelland, 2003), cell adhesion (Knodler et al., 2009), and 

systemic infection (Paesold et al., 2002), respectively. The absence of these genes may 

possibly  be  due  to  the  different  serovars  found  in  this  study,  since  these  genes  are 

normally found in S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis. Similar results were obtained by 

Crăciunaş et al. (2012), who evaluated 39 isolates of different Salmonella spp. serovars, 

and  found  that  only  S.  Enteritidis  isolates  amplified  the  sefA  and  spvC  genes.  On  the 

other  hand,  Bolton  et  al.  (2013)  evaluated  29  isolates  of  Salmonella  spp.  for  the 

presence of the spvC and pefA genes, and observed that 96.6% amplified the spvC gene, 

Regarding  to  L.  monocytogenes  isolates,  resistance  to  gentamicin  (1/12),  kanamycin 

(1/12)  and  sulfonamides  (10/12)  were  observed.  Intermediate  resistance  was  observed 

for  clindamycin  (7/12)  and  erythromycin  (1/12).  Similar  results  were  described  by 

Camargo et al. (2014); Conter et al. (2009); Harakeh et al. (2009); Yücel et al. (2005);

and Zulema Ruiz-Bolivar (2011), showing that the incidence of antimicrobial resistance 

in  L.  monocytogenes  from  food  is  still  low.  It  is  noteworthy  that  isolate  L18  was 

resistant to gentamicin, erythromycin, sulfonamides, and kanamycin, and was therefore 

classified  as  multi-drug  resistant,  since  resistance  to  three  antimicrobial  classes  was 

observed (EFSA/ECDC, 2013). The multi-drug resistance of the L18 isolate reinforces 

the  importance  of  monitoring  the  antimicrobial  resistance  profile  of  L.  monocytogenes 

isolated from food, since an overall increase in the incidence of antimicrobial resistance 

in  foodborne  strains  has  been  reported  (Granier  et  al.,  2011;  Haubert  et  al.,  2015; 

Kovacevic et al., 2013; Loiko et al., 2016).  

Among  the  Salmonella  isolates,  23.5%  (4/17)  were  resistant  to  antimicrobial 

agents. The isolates belonging to the serovars S. Anatum, S. Derby and S. Enterica were

resistant to more than one antimicrobial agent, as described in previous studies (Favier 

et  al.,  2013,  Alemu  et al., 2012;  Brichta-Harhay  et  al.,  2011;  Yan  et  al.,  2010).  In our 

study,  the  antimicrobial  agents  most  related  to  multi-drug  resistance  belong  to  the  β-

lactams, aminoglycosides and tetracyclines, which have different action spectra, but are 

usually used in veterinary and human medicine.

all  of  them  presented  virulence  determinants  and  one  showed  multi-drug  resistance, 

characterizing  a  public  health  issue.  In  relationship  to  Salmonella  isolates,  many 

serovars frequently related to outbreaks of foodborne diseases were identified. This data
