Abstract Prevalence, presence of virulence and adherence associated genes, genetic
diversity, biochemical characteristics, and antibiotic susceptibility were determined for
Escherichia coli O157 isolated over 4 months in Chongqing city and Three-Gorge
Reservoir Areas. 11 isolates of E. coli O157 were isolated from 1504 samples and 7 of them
are O157:H7 and 4 are O157:H? All O157:H7 isolates had eaeA, ehxA, EspA and Tccp
genes, but did not have stx1 and stx2. All O157:H? isolates did not have stx1, stx2, eaeA,
ehxA, EspA and Tccp genes except for the isolate obtained from Yunyang county which had
stx1. When eaeA and ehxA presented in isolates were digested by restriction enzymes, the
numbers and the sizes of the segments were the same as the control E. coli O157 strains.
This suggests that eaeA and ehxA exhibit poor polymorphism. Most E. coli O157 isolates
showed identical biochemical activities to the standard strains for sorbitol and rhamnose,
and all E. coli O157:H7 obtained from feces at the same dairy cattle farm had similar
biochemical characteristics. Antibiotic susceptibility demonstrated resistance of the isolates
to penicillin, ampicillin, bacitracin, cefuroxime, erythromycin, gentamycin and tetracycline,
indicating the isolates obtained in this study had a multi-drug resistance.

Introduction

Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is an important food-borne human
pathogen in the world. Since it was recognized as a pathogen in 1982 in the United States
(Riley et al. 1983), this serotype has been isolated in many countries (Zhao et al. 1995;
Sekiya 1997; Bonardi et al. 1999; Chapman et al. 2001; Bruce et al. 2003; Rivas et al. 2006).
In China, E. coli O157:H7 has caused two outbreaks in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, and
expanded to the Central, North and Southwest China in 1999 and 2000 (Chen et al. 2001; Ni
et al. 2002; Ma et al. 2004; Zhu et al. 2004; Lu et al. 2005), respectively.

E. coli O157 might cause diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, hemorrhagic colitis (HC), and
hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) (Besser et al. 1993; Bruce et al. 2003; Salerno et al. 2004).
The pathogenic factors of EHEC include Shiga toxins (Ludwig and Muller-Wiefel 1998), the
chromosomal LEE locus that carries factors (eaeA, EspA) involved in the attaching and
effacing process (Dean-Nystrom et al. 1998; Shaw et al. 2001; Neves et al. 2003), an EHEC
O157:H7 type III effecter protein that couples Tir to the actin-cytoskeleton (Tccp) (Garmendia
et al. 2004), and a large plasmid carrying the enterohemolysin genes (Schmidt et al. 1995).
Although some studies do not advise antibiotic treatment for infections caused by E. coli
O157 in humans (Wong et al. 2000), others suggest that disease progression may be
prevented by administrating antibiotics at an early stage (Shiomi et al. 1999; Pickering
2001). It
to determine whether E. coli O157:H7 develops resistance to
antibiotics in the animal reservoir and to determine if it is a possible source for the spread of
resistant factors to other microorganisms in animal gastrointestinal tracts.

is important

Chongqing is an upriver city along Yangtze River with a large population more than 30
million. If E. coli O157 would outbreak, not only would upriver water be polluted and
the citizen’s lives threatened, but also the whole Yangtze River would be polluted and the
people living along Yangtze river be in danger. Therefore, it is important to carry on the
epidemiological survey in Chongqing and Three-Gorge Reservoir Areas.

The purpose of this study is to collect epidemiological data of E. coli O157 isolated from
domestic animals in Chongqing and Three-Gorge Reservoir Areas and to identify the
biochemical characteristics and the antibiotic-sensitivity of the isolated bacteria. The study
also aims to acquire the data of virulence and adherence associated genes in E. coli O157
and to investigate the level of polymorphism of the E. coli O157:H7.

Primer pairs evaluating the presence of O157, H7, virulence and adherence
associated genes

The primer pairs used to amplify rfbE, fliC, stx1, stx2, eaeA, ehxA, EspA and Tccp genes in
this study were designed based on previous studies (Sandhu et al. 1996; Gannon et al. 1997;
Boerlin et al. 1998; Desmarchelier et al. 1998; Louie et al. 1998; De Baets et al. 2004) and
the sequences of the primers are shown in Table 2.

Isolation and identification of E. coli O157

During each farm visit, cottontipped-swabs were rubbed along the recto-anal mucosal
surface. All samples were immediately transported to the laboratory in ice-cooled
containers. Within 48 h of sampling, 1 g of feces from each sample was suspended in
20 ml of modified E.coli broth supplemented containing 20 mgl–1 novobiocin (mEC+n)
and incubated for 6 h at 37°C (Vali et al. 2004). Following incubation, 20 μl of mEC+n
was added to 980 μl of physiological saline solution (pH 7.2), and the mixture was plated
on sorbitol MacConkey agar supplemented with cefixime (2.5 mgl–1) and potassium
tellurite (0.05 mgl–1) with cottontipped-swabs and incubated for 18 h at 37°C. Five non-
sorbitol-fermenting colonies were picked and plated onto triple sugar iron agar for 18 h at
37°C. Distinctive colonies were tested with anti-E. coli O157 and anti-E. coli H7 sera.
Physiological saline solution was used as the negative control.

Detection of rfbE and fliC genes by PCR assay

E. coli O157 isolates were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to
determine the presence of rfbE and fliC genes. Template DNA was prepared from pure
culture of isolates, grown in LB for 18 h at 37°C. Three milliliters of culture was

centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 5 min, and the pellet was re-suspended in 0.2 ml ddH2O. The
suspension was heated at 100°C for 10 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min.
The supernate was used for the PCR template. Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, USA)
was used in a total volume of 50 μl. The reaction was carried out in a Bio-Rad PCR system
PTC-100 Peltier Thermal Cycler at 94°C for 5 min, with 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 66°C
for 30 s, and 72°C for 40 s, and final extension at 72°C for 6 min. PCR products were
run on a 1.5% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV
illumination.

Detection of virulence and adherence associated genes of E. coli O157

E. coli O157 isolates and three referenced strains were examined by PCR assay to
determine the presence of Shiga toxin 1 and 2 genes (stx1 and stx2), E. coli attaching-and-
effacing gene A subunit eaeA, enterohemolysin gene A subunit ehxA, E. coli secreted
protein A subunit EspA, and Tir-cytoskeleton coupling protein gene Tccp. Non-multiplex
PCR was performed in a 20 μl final reaction volume containing 20 mM primers, 10 mM
dNTPs, 20 mM 10×PCR buffer, 0.8 μl template DNA, 0.8 U Taq polymerase, and 15.6 μl
ddH2O. All strains were tested as described previously with primers specific to the genes
encoding the stx1 (Louie et al. 1998), stx2 (De Baets et al. 2004), eaeA (Sandhu et al.
1996), and ehxA (Boerlin et al. 2004). EspA cycling condition was as follows: initial
denaturation at 94°C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 56°C for 30 s, and 72°C for
50 s; and final extension at 72°C for 6 min. Tccp cycling condition was as follows: initial
denaturation at 94°C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 56°C for 1 min, and 72°C for
1 min; and final extension at 72°C for 6 min. PCR amplicons were run on a 1.5% agarose
gel, strained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV illumination.

Analysis of EHEC O157:H7 by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length
polymorphism (PCR-RFLP)

EaeA and ehxA of seven E. coli O157:H7 isolates were amplified by PCR as the above.
PCR was performed in a 100 μl final reaction volume. Products of PCR were recycled by
Purification Kit (Promega). 10 μl volume of the amplification products was digested with 5
to 10 U of restriction endonuclease for 6 h in a final volume of 20 μl. The enzymes HincII
and EcoRII were used to digest the eaeA amplification products, and the enzymes HaeIII,
HinfI, EcoRII, and RsaI were used to digest the ehxA amplification products. The resulting
DNA fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis in 2 to 4% agarose gels in TAE, and
strained for 30 min in a 1 μgml-1 ethidium bromide solution. Restriction maps were
constructed for each restriction pattern by using the known sequences of the eaeA and ehxA
genes. The magnitude of nucleotide differences between pairs of isolates for the sequences
under investigation was estimated by using the proportion of shared restriction sites.

Biochemical and motility assays

Biochemical assays of E. coli O157 isolates were completed with methyl red (MR), Voges-
Proskauer (VP), indole, sorbitol, glucose, sulfureted hydrogen, urease, rhamnose, esculin,
ONPG, DNA, dulcitol, maltose, phenylalanine deaminase, nitrate (dexidize), citrate,
ornithine decarboxylase, arginine decarboxylase, and lysine decarboxylase. Motility was
examined by agar stab method using motility GI medium. The results were recorded after
incubating the samples for 48 h at 37°C (Tianhe, Hangzhou, China).

Antibiotic sensitivity testing

The susceptibilities of the E. coli O157 isolates to the different antimicrobial agents were
tested using the disk-agar method standardized by the National Committee for Clinical
Laboratory Standards (NCCLS 2002). The isolates were tested against 13 antibiotics
(Tianhe) after incubating the samples for 24 h at 37°C. The antibiotics were penicillin,
ampicillin, cefazolin sodium, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, streptomycin, gentamicin, erythro-
mycin, bacitracin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and ofloxacin. The
characterization of isolates as being susceptible, having intermediate susceptibility, or being
resistant was recorded as recommended by NCCLS.

Results

Overall prevalence of E. coli O157-positive samples

From 1483 rectal fecal samples and 21 sewage samples, 11 isolates of E. coli O157 were
isolated from feces and the proportion is 0.73%. The results are listed in Table 1. The
number of individual positive samples from fecal samples of dairy cattle, pigs, sows, piglets
with diarrhea, normal piglets, and goats were 6 (0.40%), 4 (0.27%), 1 (0.07%), 0, 0, and 0,
respectively. The E.coli O157 isolates were isolated from four different counties in
Chongqing city from April to June. In March, no E. coli O157 was isolated. Of the 300
fecal samples of dairy cattle, the number of positive samples of E. coli O157:H7 is 6 (2%);
1 E. coli O157:H7 isolate (0.20%) and 3 E. coli O157:H? isolates (0.60%) were obtained
from 497 pig fecal samples; 1 E. coli O157:H? isolate (0.52%) was isolated from 191 sow
fecal samples. No O157 isolate was detected in fecal samples of 70 piglets with diarrhea, 97
normal piglets and 328 goats.

Also, no O157 isolate was detected in the samples collected from Hechuan county and
Fuling district. Six O157:H7 isolates were isolated from the same dairy cattle farm in Yubei
district. One O157:H7 and three O157:H? isolates were isolated in the fecal samples of pigs
from Rongchang and Yongchuan counties. In Yunyang county, one O157:H? was isolated
from a hoggery, but no O157 was isolated from goats.

Genes of O157 rfbE and H7 fliC

E. coli O157 isolates were confirmed by monoclonal antibodies and PCR assay. All isolates
obtained from Yubei district were positive for rfbE and fliC. Four O157 isolates from
Rongchang and Yongchuan counties were serotype O157, including 1 O157:H7 isolates
and 3 O157:H? isolates. The isolate obtained from Yunyang county was positive for rfbE
but negative for fliC (Fig. 1).

Presence of virulence and adherence associated genes

Genetic profiling for E. coli O157 virulence and adherence associated genes such as stx1,
stx2, eaeA, ehxA, EspA, and Tccp was performed by PCR. The results are listed in Table 3.
All E. coli O157 isolates were negative for stx2. All E. coli O157:H7 isolates were positive
for eaeA, ehxA, EspA, and Tccp except for stx. All E. coli O157:H? isolates were negative
for all virulence and adherence associated genes except for one isolate obtained from
Yunyang county carried stx1.

As positive controls, all 6 genes were amplified for O157-Sakai, O157–44828 and
O157–00B015 and the PCR products of the 6 genes were obtained from three strains except
for the O157–00B015 that is negative for stx1 and stx2. As negative control, no PCR
product was amplified for E. coli DH5α. These results show that PCR was sensitive and
specific for genic identification.

PCR-RFLP of eaeA and ehxA genes

After the PCR products of the eaeA genes were digested using the restriction enzymes
HincIIand EcoRII, same restriction types were identified for 7 O157:H7 isolates and 3
control strains in this study. Three bands were obtained by electrophoresing the digested
solutions because electrophoresis did not show small fragments less than 41 bp. These
observations were consistent with the expected results. Similarly, we also examined the
restriction types of the PCR products of the ehxA genes for 7 O157:H7 isolates by using
the restriction enzymes HaeIII, Rsa Ι and EcoRII, and our observations were in line with the
results that the standard strains were digested with the same enzymes.

E. coli O157's biochemical characteristics

All
isolates could ferment glucose, urease, ONPG, maltose, ornithine decarboxylase,
arginine decarboxylase, lysine decarboxylase, MR, and indole, however, they could not
ferment sulfureted hydrogen, esculin, phenylalanine deaminase, nitrate (dexidize), and VP

(Table 4). Isolates obtained from Yubei district could not ferment sorbitol, rhamnose, citrate
and DNA but could ferment dulcitol. Similarly, of the isolates obtained from Rongchang
and Yongchuan counties, all could ferment dulcitol and citrate; one could ferment sorbitol
at 37°C for 24 h, two for rhamnose and three for DNA.

Susceptibility of E. coli O157 to antibiotics

Eleven E. coli O157 isolates were tested for the susceptibility to antibiotics. All isolates
were resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, and bacitracin. Most were sensitive to cefazolin
(72.7%), cefotaxime (90.9%), chloramphenicol
(72.7%), streptomycin (72.7%) and
ofloxacin (72.7%) (Table 5). Five isolates (45.5%) were sensitive to cefuroxime, three
(27.3%) were sensitive to gentamicin, six (54.5%) were sensitive to sulfamethoxazole, and
only one (9.1%) was sensitive to tetracycline.

Isolates obtained from Yubei were found to be sensitive to cefotaxime, streptomycin,
sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol and ofloxacin, and isolates obtained from Rongchang
and Yongchuan counties were resistant to both sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline. One
isolate obtained from Yunyang county in an enclosure with pigs on a farm was sensitive to
cefazolin sodium, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ofloxacin.

Discussion

E. coli O157 has been prevalent in the United States (Zhao et al. 1995), Japan (Sekiya
1997), Netherlands (Schouten et al. 2005), Italy (Bonardi et al. 1999), Switzerland

Ruminants are the primary reservoir and the main sources of human infection, though pig,
poultry, and wild birds have also been shown to transiently harbor O157 naturally (Zhao et
al. 1995; Wallace et al. 1997; Kang et al. 2004; Schouten et al. 2005; Kaufmann et al.
2006). The results obtained from the survey on dairy cattle from Yubei district in this study
showed that cattle is one of the main reservoirs of E. coli O157. In Jiangsu and Anhui
provinces, cattle were the highest carrier of isolates (Ni et al. 2002; Lu et al. 2005). In some
regions, however, other animals might be the sources of outbreaks. The survey on an
outbreak in Sui county of Henan province in 2000 indicated that Boer goats introduced
from foreign country had a higher level of positive samples 29.8% than the level of local
goats which yielded 14.8% positive samples (Ma et al. 2004). It is obvious that goats were
the reservoir of the outbreak.

Based on the survey on E. coli O157 in Chongqing city and Three-Gorge Reservoir
Areas, we found that dairy cattle had higher positive samples (2%) than pigs which yielded
0.47% positive samples. However, E. coli O157 was not detected in 328 fecal samples of
goats. Therefore, it is possible that dairy cattle were the main reservoir of E. coli O157 in
Chongqing city and Three-Gorge Reservoir Areas. The majority of dairy cattle were fed in
the city zone where it is highly populous. So, it is necessary to enhance the management of
excrementitious disposal and the transportation and pasteurization of milk.

Hog industry is a very important part of stockbreeding in Chongqing, and pigs have also
been shown to harbor O157 naturally. So, we considered pigs as the key target of this
survey. One O157:H? was isolated in a fecal sample of sow but no E. coli O157 was
isolated in fecal samples of piglets at a hoggery in Rongchang county. The possible reasons
for this are the protection of the maternal antibody or the use of antibiotics that inhibit the
bacteria which cause yellow scour of newborn piglets and white scour of piglets. It could be
proved by the susceptibility to antibiotics of the isolates obtained in Rongchang and
Yongchuan counties. In the abattoir, pigs came from diverse sources, and had a high flow
rate. These are potential factors to cause the prevalence of E. coli O157. It is important to
enhance the management of the feces in abattoirs.

The presence of stx1, stx2 and eaeA in E. coli O157:H7 strains isolated from cattle has
been investigated all over the world and studies performed in the USA, Japan, Taiwan of
China, and the European countries have revealed that the percentage of the verotoxigenic
strains varied from 0 to 100%. Stx2 and eaeA genes were found to be more frequent than
stx1 in most of the studies performed in these countries (Chapman et al. 1994; Zhao et al.
1995; Sekiya 1997; Bonardi et al. 1999; Galland et al. 2001; Omisakin et al. 2003;). Some
research carried out in China showed that the positive rates of stx2 were higher in the areas
where the outbreak occurred or sporadic cases existed (Guo et al. 2002; Yang et al. 2002;
Zhu et al. 2004). During the outbreak in Sui county of Henan province in 2000, all E. coli
O157:H7 isolated from patients, domestic animals, and poultry carried the gene stx2 but not
the gene stx1 (Ma et al. 2004). In the areas where outbreak did not occur or sporadic cases
did not exist, isolates did not carry stx2, or only a few carried the stx2 gene (Gong et al.
2004; Zhu et al. 2005). A study carried out by Liu et al showed 5 E. coli O157 strains
isolated from Chongqing urban district lacked the gene stx2 (Li et al. 1999). This, together
with our observation that all O157:H7 isolates had eaeA, ehxA, EspA, and Tccp genes and
all O157:H? isolates did not have virulence and adherence associated genes except one
isolate carried the gene stx1, suggested that the E. coli O157 isolated in Chongqing and
Three-Gorge Reservoir Areas might lack the stx2 gene.

The enzymes HincII and EcoRIIwere used to digest the eaeA amplification products, and
the enzymes HaeIII, HinfI, EcoRII, and RsaI were used to digest the ehxA amplification
products. Then we could find that restriction endonuclease sites of eaeA and ehxA are
conserved and that the digested fragments have the same profile as the standard isolates. In
a study, Boerlin et al also did not find the polymorphism of eaeA and ehxA by PCR-RFLP
(Boerlin et al. 1998). All results demonstrated that the eaeA and ehxA in Shiga toxin-
producing Escherichia coli (STEC) were highly conserved. Seven O157:H7 isolates
identified in this study showed the same genotype for the virulence factors, suggesting that
E. coli O157:H7 has poor polymorphism.

Most of E. coli O157 isolates showed significantly and divergently biochemical
activities from classical E. coli for sorbitol and rhamnose (Karch et al. 1993; Hayes et al.
1995;). E. coli O157:H7 obtained from feces at the same diary cattle farm had similar
biochemical characteristics, and was identical to standard strains in main biochemical
characteristics, especially for sorbitol and rhamnose. O157 isolates, including one O157:H7
and four O157:H?, obtained from fecal samples of pigs at different hoggeries had a diverse
biochemical characteristics, especial for two isolates that could ferment sorbitol.

Some studies showed many E. coli O157 strains isolated from humans and cattle had
high rates of resistance to ampicillin (2 to 48%), tetracycline (4 to 27%), sulfamethoxazole
(10 to 26%), streptomycin (2%), and chloramphenicol (<2%) (Galland et al. 2001;
Schroeder et al. 2002). In the survey on the tolerances of 63 STEC strains to 15
antimicrobial agents, Khan et al (2002) found that most strains could tolerate ampicillin
(25.4%),
tetracycline (23.8%), and streptomycin (14.3%) and a few could tolerate
cephalothin (11.1%), co-trimoxazole (9.5%), nalidixic acid (6.4%), and neomycin (3.2%).
More than one-third of the strains (35%) showed resistances to all antimicrobial agents to
some extent but were not completely resistant to any of the antibiotics; 14.3% of the strains
were sensitive to all the antibiotics; multi-drug resistance was found in 14 strains and there
was no common resistance pattern among the strains. Our observations are consistent with
these results. Furthermore, our results showed that the strains isolated in this study were
resistant to ampicillin, bacitracin, sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline extensively and less
resistant to cephalosporins, which is consistent with previous investigations in China (Zhu
et al. 2005). This is probably due to the fact that old antibiotics were widely used in

Vet Res Commun (2008) 32:449–461

Chinese farms while use of some new drugs is still limited because of their expensive cost
and because they have not been recognized. Many strains that were sensitive to antibiotics
might evolve to the resistances and the isolates obtained in this study had a wide resistance
to antibiotics This may result from small diverse farms and abuse of antibiotics. In addition,
the selection pressure for the use of combined antibiotics in domestic animal breeding
might be responsible for the development of the resistances.

The positive rates of E. coli O157 isolated from domestic animals in Chongqing city and
Three-Gorge Reservoir Areas is low. All the O157:H7 isolates carried the eaeA, ehxA,
EspA, and Tccp, and all the O157 isolates lacked stx that is closely associated with
pathogenesis. So, it is impossible to lead to an outbreak of E. coli O157 under the lack of
the necessary condition. However, it is possible that same other STEC transfer stx2 to E.
coli O157. In addition, the positive rates of E. coli O157 in animals may increase under
certain circumstance. Thus, E. coli O157 may break out. So,
to do
epidemiological survey on E. coli O157 periodically.
