Abstract

This study evaluated the microbiological quality of milk and Coalho cheese, the prevalence of enterotoxin 
genes, antimicrobial resistance and determined an inducible MLSB resistance phenotype by the D-test 
in strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from these products. Seventy samples of milk and Coalho 
cheese were analyzed. S. aureus strains were identified by biochemical tests. The presence of se genes 
(sea-see) was tested by polymerase chain reaction. The antimicrobial sensitivity of S. aureus strains was 
evaluated for 13 antimicrobial drugs using the disk diffusion technique and the double-disk diffusion 
test (D-test) was performed to determine inducible resistance to lincosamide phenotype. The amount 
of toxin sufficient to cause foodborne diseases is generally observed when Staphylococcus populations 
exceed 105 CFU mL-1 g-1. In this study, none of the milk samples analyzed showed these counts; however, 
73.3% (22/30) of Coalho cheese samples exceeded this value. A total of 109 isolates were identified as 
S. aureus. The presence of enterotoxin genes was detected in 25.7% of these isolates and amplified only 
for the sec gene. Most of the isolates (78.5%) were resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents. The 
D test showed that 25.0% of erythromycin-resistant isolates had the constitutive resistance phenotype, 
and 3.8% had the inducible resistance phenotype to clindamycin. These results indicate that these dairy

Resumo

Este estudo avaliou a qualidade microbiológica de amostras de leite e queijo de Coalho, a prevalência 
de genes das enterotoxinas, a resistência antimicrobiana e o fenótipo de resistência MLSB por meio do 
D-teste, em cepas de Staphylococcus aureus isoladas destes produtos. Foram analisadas 70 amostras 
de leite e queijo de coalho. Cepas de S. aureus foram identificadas por meio de testes bioquímicos. A 
presença de genes se (sea-see) foi verificada pela técnica da reação em cadeia da polimerase (PCR). A 
sensibilidade antimicrobiana das cepas de S. aureus foi avaliada para 13 antimicrobianos, utilizando a 
técnica de difusão em disco e o ensaio de difusão de disco duplo (D-teste), para determinar o fenótipo de 
resistência induzível à lincosamidas. A quantidade de enterotoxina estafilocócica suficiente para causar 
a intoxicação alimentar é geralmente observada quando a população de estafilococos excede a contagem 
de 105 UFC mL-1 g-1. Neste estudo, nenhuma das amostras de leite analisadas apresentou esta contagem, 
entretanto, 73,3 % (22/30) das amostras de queijo de Coalho ultrapassaram este valor. Um total de 
109 isolados foram identificados como S. aureus. A presença de genes de enterotoxinas foi detectada 
em 25,7% destas estirpes, ocorrendo amplificação apenas para o gene sec. A maioria destas bactérias 
(78,5 %) apresentaram resistência a um ou mais de dois agentes antimicrobianos. O D-teste demostrou 
que  25,0  %  dos  isolados  resistentes  à  eritromicina  tinham  o  fenótipo  de  resistência  constitutiva  e 
3,8 % tinham o fenótipo de resistência induzível à clindamicina. Estes resultados indicam que estes 
produtos lácteos representam um risco para a saúde, desde que essas bactérias podem causar doenças 
de origem alimentar ou podem ser um possível caminho para a transferência de cepas resistentes aos 
antimicrobianos para os seres humanos.

Introduction

Several  reports  have  shown  foodborne  disease 
outbreaks caused by milk and other dairy products. 
These  outbreaks  can  be  associated  with  the  poor 
microbiological quality of these products, which is 
influenced by the raw milk microbiota, processing 
conditions,  and  post-heat  treatment  contamination 
(CRETENET et al., 2011; EFSA, 2015; BRASIL, 
2018; PAULIN et al., 2011). 

In Brazil, the majority of small dairy farms have 
poor technology and present deficiencies in hygiene 
and  sanitary  control,  which  results  in  raw  milk 
with high levels of microbiological contamination 
(AZEVÊDO  et  al.,  2014;  DANTAS  et  al.,  2013; 
RALL  et  al.,  2008).  It  is  under  these  conditions 
that  many  varieties  of  cheese  are  often  produced, 

including  Coalho  cheese,  increasing  the  risk  of 
foodborne diseases. 

Coalho cheese, which is very popular and widely 
consumed  by  the  regional  population,  is  mainly 
produced in the Northeastern States of Brazil. This 
production represents a significant source of income 
for  milk  suppliers,  especially  those  who  do  not 
have access to milk processing plants (AZEVÊDO 
et al., 2014; DANTAS et al., 2013; OLIVEIRA et 
al., 2010; SOUSA et al., 2014; TIGRE; BORELLY, 
2011). 

Staphylococcal food poisoning (SFP) is one of 
the most common foodborne diseases related to the 
consumption of dairy products (CRETENET et al., 
2011; EFSA, 2015; LE LOIR et al., 2003). It is caused 
by  the  ingestion  of  staphylococcal  enterotoxins

of  different  Staphylococcus  species,  but  mainly 
Staphylococcus  aureus  (ARGAW;  ADDIS,  2015; 
HENNEKINNE et al., 2012). 

SEs  are  potent  superantigens  whose  biological 
activity  is  retained  even  after  the  pasteurization 
of  milk  (CRETENET  et  al.,  2011;  PAULIN  et 
al.,  2011).  To  date,  20  different  SEs  have  been 
described and traditionally divided into two groups: 
classical (SEA-SEE) enterotoxins and non-classical 
enterotoxins (SEG-SEI, SEK-SEV) (FISHER et al., 
2018; HENNEKINNE et al., 2012).

About  95.0%  of  SPF  outbreaks  worldwide  are 
caused by classical SEs (ARGAW; ADDIS, 2015; 
CRETENET  et  al.,  2011;  LE  LOIR  et  al.,  2003). 
However,  molecular  studies  suggest  that  non-
classical  enterotoxins  play  a  prominent  role  in 
this  disease,  with  the  low  availability  of  sensitive 
methods  for  confirming  the  involvement  of  these 
toxins in outbreaks having contributed to their real 
prevalence  being  underestimated  (DENAYER  et 
al., 2017; UMEDA et al., 2017).

resistance 

In  addition  to  the  production  of  enterotoxins, 
S.  aureus  strains  may  have  several  mechanisms 
(REYGAERT,  2013). 
of  antibiotic 
Multidrug-resistant  strains  have  been 
isolated 
from  the  food  chain,  including  dairy  products 
(DARWISH;  HANNA,  2013;  OLIVEIRA  et  al., 
2011). 

Macrolides  are  widely  used  in  the  therapy  of 
mastitis  infections  (OLIVER;  MURINDA,  2012). 
Macrolide  resistance  can  be  either  constitutive 
or  inducible.  Strains  with  inducible  resistance  to 
clindamycin  are  difficult  to  detect  in  the  routine 
laboratory  as  they  appear  to  be  clindamycin-
sensitive  and  erythromycin-resistant  when 
the 
disks are not placed adjacent to each other, but in 
vivo therapy with clindamycin may lead to clinical 
therapeutic failure (LI et al., 2015; STEWARD et 
al., 2005).

In  this  context,  the  aims  of  this  work  were 
to  evaluate  whether 
the  Coagulase-Positive 
Staphylococci (CPS) counting meets the standards 
established by the Brazilian legislation in milk and 
Coalho cheeses (RDC/ANVISA n° 12), and, due to 
the importance of S. aureus among SCP, to determine 
which CPS are S. aureus, evaluate the presence of 
genes encoding classical enterotoxins and assess the 
antimicrobial resistance in these strains.

Material and Methods
Sampling procedure

Three small-scale dairy farms (A, B, C) situated 
in the rural area of Teresina City, Piauí State, Brazil 
were  selected  based  on  the  ease  of  access.  Forty 
samples of bulk tank milk and 30 samples of Coalho 
cheese  were  sampled  weekly  in  the  period  from 
January to May 2013. 

From farm A, which uses pasteurized cow milk 
for  cheese  making,  10  samples  of  raw  milk,  10 
samples of pasteurized milk and 10 cheese samples 
were collected. From the other farms, which prepare 
the cheese from raw cow milk, 10 raw milk samples 
and 10 cheese samples were collected. Each sample 
consisted of 250 g of cheese or 250 ml of milk and 
was collected aseptically in sterile flasks; these were 
immediately transported in coolers to the laboratory. 

Isolation and counting of Staphylococcus Coagulase 
Positive

A portion of 25 g of cheese or 25 ml of milk was 
homogenized with 225 ml of 0.1% buffered peptone 
water  (Himedia,  India).  Decimal  serial  dilutions 
were  prepared,  and  each  dilution  was  plated  in 
Baird-Parker  agar  (Himedia,  India)  supplemented 
with egg yolk-tellurite emulsion (NewProv, Brazil). 
Plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 h. Then, 10 
colonies,  typical  or  atypical,  were  enumerated 
and  subsequently  taken  for  confirmatory  testing 
(LAIRD et al., 2004).

S. aureus identification

S. aureus was identified through tube coagulase 
reaction, aerobic and anaerobic fermentation of the 
sugars  trehalose,  maltose,  and  mannitol,  acetoin 
production (Voges-Proskauer test), β-galactosidase 
activity  and  growth  on  P-agar  with  7  µg  mL-1 
acriflavine  dye  (GANDRA  et  al.,  2005; WINN  et 
al., 2008).

Detection  of  classical  staphylococcal  enterotoxins 
genes

DNA from each S. aureus strain was extracted 
from  1.0  ml  of  BHI  culture  medium  incubated  at 
37°C  overnight  (BD,  New  Jersey,  USA)  using  a 
Wizard®  kit  (Promega®,  USA),  according  to  the 
manufacturer’s instructions, except for the cell lysis, 
which  was  performed  using  1.3  U  of  lysostaphin 
(Sigma®,  USA).  All  of  the  DNA  samples  were 
stored at -20ºC.

All  S.  aureus  species  identified  were  screened 
for enterotoxin sea, seb, sec, sed and see genes by 
PCR. Table 1 shows the primers used for each gene 
studied.

The  PCR  was  performed  in  a  25  μl  reaction 
mixture, as previously described (JOHNSON et al., 
1991), by using 100 ng of DNA with the following 
amplification  cycles:  for  the  detection  of  the  sea, 
seb and sec genes, initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 
minutes followed by 27 cycles of denaturation for 2 
minutes, annealing of primers at 52°C for 2 minutes 
and extension at 72°C for 1 minute. A final step at 
72°C for 5 minutes was performed after completion 
of  cycles.  For  amplification  of  the  sed  and  see 

genes, the same parameters were used, except for 
annealing temperature, which was 51°C and 50°C, 
respectively (Table 1). 

The  following  strains  of  S.  aureus  were  used 
as  positive  controls  for  the  presence  of  the  genes 
evaluated:  FRI  996  (sea,  seb,  and  sed  positive); 
INCQS 00080 (sec positive) and ATCC 27664 (see 
positive).  Furthermore,  strains  of  S.  epidermidis 
ATCC  12228  and  Escherichia  coli  ATCC  25922 
were used as negative controls for the PCR reactions.

The  S.  aureus  strains  were  assessed  for 
susceptibility  to  a  panel  of  antimicrobial  agents 
using  the  disc  diffusion  method  on  Mueller-
Hinton  agar  (BD),  according  to  the  Clinical  and 
Laboratory  Standards  Institute  (CLSI,  2012).  The 
following  impregnated  antibiotic  discs  (Cecon) 
were  used:  ampicillin  (10  µg),  doxycycline  (30 
µg),  chloramphenicol  (30  µg),  linezolid  (30  µg), 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (25 µg), tetracycline 
(30 µg), penicillin G (10 U), cephalothin (30 µg), 
enrofloxacin (5 µg) and gentamycin (10 µg). After 
incubation at 35 ± 2°C for 24 h, the susceptibility 
of the S. aureus isolates to each antimicrobial agent 
was assessed by measuring the halos of inhibition 
for each antimicrobial agent, and the results were 
interpreted in accordance with the standard criteria 
(CLSI,  2015).  Oxacillin  (1  µg)  and  cefoxitin  (30 
mg) disks were used for the detection of methicillin-
resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). 

To  determine 

inducible  clindamycin 
resistance phenotype, the D-test was carried out by 

the 

using erythromycin (15 µg) and clindamycin discs 
(2  µg),  as  recommended  (FIEBELKORN  et  al., 
2003). The plates were incubated at 35°C for 18 h, 
and the production of D-shaped zones between the 
erythromycin  and  clindamycin  disks  was  visually 
evaluated.

The  strains  S.  aureus  ATCC  25923  and  S. 
aureus ATCC BAA-977, which contain ermA, and 
S.  aureus ATCC  BAA-976,  which  contains  msrA, 
were included in each trial as controls for the quality 
assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility and CLI-
induction testing.

In  this  study,  coagulase-positive  staphylococci 
(CPS) were observed in 11 (27.5%) out of 40 milk 
samples and 22 (73.4%) out of 30 cheese samples 
(Table 2).

The amount of toxin sufficient to cause foodborne 
diseases is generally observed when Staphylococcus 
counts  exceed  105 CFU  mL-1  g-1  (CRETENET  et 
al., 2011). In this study, none of the milk samples 
analyzed  showed  these  counts.  However,  73.3% 
(22/30)  of  Coalho  cheese  samples  exceeded  this 

value. Furthermore, these samples do not conform 
to standards established by the National Agency of 
Sanitary Surveillance (ANVISA) for cheese, which 
determines  maximum  counts  of  5.0  X  102  CFU/g 
(BRASIL, 2001).

Semina: Ciências Agrárias, Londrina, v. 39, n. 5, p. 1957-1968, set./out. 2018Microbiology quality, detection of enterotoxin genes and antimicrobial resistance of Staphylococcus aureus isolated...Similar  results  were  found  in  Brazil,  which 
verified  CPS  counts  of  between  105  and  106 CFU 
g-1 in 35.0% of samples of Coalho cheese analyzed 
and marketed in Salvador City (TIGRE; BORELY, 
2011).  Another  study  found  CPS  counts  ranging 
from  1.6  x  103  to  2.0  x  105  CFU  g-1  in  76.2%  of 
Coalho  cheese  samples  analyzed  (SOUSA  et  al., 
2014; OLIVEIRA et al., 2010). Unlike these studies, 
Borges et al. (2008) did not demonstrate high counts 
of  these  agents,  with  results  ranging  from  <2.0 
x  101  to  102  CFU  g-1  for  Coalho  cheese  from  the 
production line in Fortaleza City, Ceará State. 

The  differences  observed  in  the  CPS  counts 
between milk and cheese samples may be explained 
by  the  capacity  of  these  bacteria  to  grow  in  milk 
and  cheese  during  the  cheese  making  process. 
Another  possible  source  of  cheese  contamination 
could  be  unhygienic  milk  processing  conditions 
or  handling  practices  in  cheese  manufacturing. 
These  staphylococci  could  be  introduced  directly 
to  milk  from  the  cow  with  clinical  or  subclinical 
staphylococcal  mastitis,  from  the  environment 
or  by  human  handling,  since  coagulase  positive 
species such as S. aureus belong to the microbiota 
(AZEVÊDO et al., 2014; JØRGENSEN et al., 2005; 
PAULIN et al., 2011).

The consumption of Coalho cheese in the North 
and  Northeast  of  the  Brazil  is  vast.  It  has  also 
achieved international projection by being reported 
as  a  major  functional  food  (SILVA  et  al.,  2012). 

Therefore, it is important to obtain a higher quality 
product with the adoption of Good Manufacturing 
Practices (GMP) and the heat treatment of raw milk 
by producers.

S. aureus identification

Out of 479 Staphylococcus spp. isolates obtained 
from milk and Coalho cheese samples, 148 (30.9%) 
were characterized as CPS; of these, 109 (73.6%) 
were  identified  as  S.  aureus.  These  isolates  were 
biochemically identified by positive coagulase 4+ or 
3+ in rabbit plasma, the ability to ferment mannitol, 
maltose and trehalose under aerobic conditions and 
mannitol under anaerobic conditions, the production 
of acetoin, the absence of β-galactosidase activity 
and acriflavine resistance. 

In Brazil, this species was associated with 798 
outbreaks (19.5%) from 2000 to 2014, with more 
than 356 being linked to dairy products (BRASIL, 
2018).

Detection  of  classical  staphylococcal  enterotoxins 
genes

None of the S. aureus strains were positive for 
the sea, seb, sed and see genes, while 28 (25.7%) 
were positive for the sec gene, with 3 (10.7%) being 
reported in milk and 25 (89.3%) in Coalho cheese 
(Table 3).

SE: staphylococcal enterotoxins. * All strains positives for SEs genes amplified only for the sec gene.

Akindolire et al. (2015) and Khudor et al. (2012) 
found  similar  results,  with  the  sec  gene  detected 
in 24.5% and 32.7%, respectively, of the S. aureus 
isolates  from  bovine  milk  samples;  none  of  the 
other SE genes were detected. Also, Tsegmed et al. 
(2007) found the sec gene in 19.0% of the S. aureus 
isolates  in  raw  milk,  and  none  of  these  isolates 
had  the  sea,  seb,  sed  or  see  genes.  Other  authors 
observed that S. aureus strains isolated from milk 
and dairy products from ruminants had mainly sec 
and sea genes; in humans, the sea gene was the most 
frequently  identified  (JØRGENSEN  et  al.,  2005; 
NORMANNO et al., 2007; RALL et al., 2008). 

The prevalence of enterotoxin genes in S. aureus 
strains  often  depends  on  the  environment  from 
which the strain was isolated (PAULIN et al., 2011; 
JØRGENSEN  et  al.,  2005).  This  variation  is  so 

great that the frequencies reported for strains of S. 
aureus  carrier  or  enterotoxin  producers  described 
for  milk,  cheese,  and  both  products  ranged  from 
12.0% to 77.7%, 9.0% to 100% and 8.8% to 93.3%, 
respectively  (PAULIN  et  al.,  2011).  Therefore, 
the results obtained in this study agree with other

isolated  from  dairy  products  with  regards  to  their 
diversity as well as their enterotoxigenicity. 

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Resistance to antimicrobial compounds used in 
veterinary  and  human  therapy  is  a  major  concern 
worldwide,  and  S.  aureus  is  known  for  its  ability 
to  become  resistant  to  antimicrobials.  Our  study 
assessed the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of 
S. aureus isolates (Table 4).

*Three strains of S. aureus obtained from of milk and one from Coalho cheese displayed inducible clindamycin resistance phenotype.

A  high  prevalence  of  β-lactam  (77.9%  for 
penicillin and 68.3% for ampicillin), erythromycin 
(65.4%),  tetracycline  (24.0%),  and  clindamycin 
(19.2%)  resistance  was  observed.  Other  studies 
found similar results (AKINDOLIRE et al., 2015; 
COSTA et al., 2013; JAMALI et al., 2015). 

One possible reason for the phenotypes presented 
in  staphylococcal  isolates  from  milk  and  cheese 
could be due to the frequent use of antibiotics for 
the  treatment  of  animal  infections,  with  β-lactam 
antibiotics  being  the  most  often  used  in  mastitis 
therapy  and  other  staphylococcal  infections,  and 
tetracycline  and  erythromycin  being  commonly 
used in animal diseases caused by several bacteria 
(JAMALI  et  al.,  2015;  SUDAGIDAN;  AYDIN, 
2013). 

In our study, we found 68 (65.4%) erythromycin-
resistant  and  20  (19.2%)  clindamycin-resistant 
isolates. For clindamycin, 3.8% (3/104) of isolates 
showed  an  inducible  resistance  phenotype  to 
clindamycin (D-test  positive)  and  15.4%  (17/104) 
isolates  showed  constitutive  resistance.  Also,  51 
isolates  showed  both  erythromycin  resistance 
and  clindamycin  sensitivity  without  an  inducible 
phenotype, suggesting that the resistance phenotype 
occurs by efflux pump, which allows the safe and 
effective  use  of  clindamycin  therapy  (LI  et  al., 
2015). 

Few  studies  have  verified  the  presence  of  the 
inducible  clindamycin  resistance  phenotype  of  S. 
aureus  isolated  from  food  (JAMALI  et  al.,  2015; 
SUDAGIDAN;  AYDIN,  2013).  Infections  caused 
by the transmission of these strains in the food chain 
can result in an inappropriate clindamycin therapy.

Fortunately,  in  this  study,  none  of  the  isolates 
were  identified  as  MRSA,  differing  from  other 
studies  that  have  described  the  detection  of  this 
microorganism in dairy products, at levels varying 
from 1.1% to 60.5% worldwide and from 10.0% to 
25.4% in Brazil (COSTA et al., 2013; DIAS et al., 
2011; PEXARA et al., 2013). 

However,  isolates  with  a  multidrug  phenotype 
were  found  in  the  current  study.  The  multidrug-
resistant  (MDR)  isolates  were  detected  in  22.8% 
of milk and 29.0% of Coalho cheese samples. The 
prevalence of MDR S. aureus isolates (26.9%) in this 
study, agrees with earlier findings (AKINDOLIRE 
et al., 2015; JAMALI et al., 2015).

Conclusion

This  study  showed  a  high  prevalence  of  milk 
and cheese contaminated with S. aureus. The higher 
counts  and  numbers  of  contaminated  samples  in 
cheese compared to milk could indicate failures in 
the hygienic conditions applied during milking and 
the manufacture of Coalho cheese. 

The results provided evidence that the presence 
of  enterotoxigenic  and  antimicrobial-resistant 
strains  of  S.  aureus  has  become  remarkably 
widespread  in  foods,  presenting  a  potential  risk 
of  foodborne  diseases.  None  of  the  isolates  were 
methicillin resistant. In this study, a low prevalence 
of the inducible clindamycin resistance phenotype 
was found among S. aureus strains; however, 26.9% 
of isolates were multidrug-resistant.

In conclusion, sanitary measures are needed to 
guarantee the quality of these products and prevent

since food may act as a vehicle for the transfer of
