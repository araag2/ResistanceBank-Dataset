Abstract 

Staphylococcus  aureus  is  a  significant  bacterial  pathogen  associated  with 

bovine mastitis. The aim of the present study was to investigate and characterize 

of S. aureus strains isolated from the milk of cows suffering from mastitis in the 

mid-east of China. Among the 200 milk samples analyzed, 58 were positive for 

S. aureus, of these isolates, 11 isolates were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 

aureus (MRSA). All of the 58 S. aureus strains were classified in agr group I, 

while  seven  different  sequence  type  (ST)  patterns  were  identified  and  among 

them  the  most  common  was  ST630  followed  by  ST188.  All  of  the  S.  aureus 

isolates belonging to ST630 were resistant to more than four antimicrobials, and 

22.2%  of  isolates  belonging  to  ST188  were  resistant  to  eight  antimicrobials. 

Interestingly, while strong biofilm producers demonstrated higher resistance to 

multiple  antimicrobials,  they  exhibited  lower  intracellular  survival  rates.  The 

results  of  this  study  illustrated  the  distribution,  antimicrobial  susceptibility 

profiles, genotype, and the ability of biofilm production and mammary epithelial 

cells invasion of these S. aureus isolates. This study can provide the basis for the 

development  of  a  disease  prevention  program  in  dairy  farms  to  reduce  the 

potential risk in both animal and human health. 

Key  words:  Staphylococcus  aureus;  bovine  mastitis;  MLST  typing;  biofilm 

production; invasion assay.

1. Introduction 

Milk  production  is  an  important  branch  of  the  Chinese  agribusiness  and 

China has become the third largest milk producing  country in the world, even 

though most Asians are lactose intolerant. As the most important disease in the 

dairy industry worldwide, bovine mastitis can cause heavy economic burdens in 

dairy herds [1]. In China, several studies have reported the isolation of S. aureus 

in  milk  samples  from  cows  with  mastitis  [2-5];  however,  data  related  to 

molecular  typing,  biofilm  production  ability  and  the  invasion  of  mammary 

epithelial cells by S. aureus from milk samples are scarce. 

Because  of  the  acquisition  of  the  mecA  gene,  many  S.  aureus  can  be 

methicillin resistance (MRSA), which can cause important therapeutic problems 

when  implicated  in  human  or  animal  infections.  However,  interests  in 

methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) have also increased in recent years, as 

published  reports  have  proven  that  MSSA  can  also  be  implicated  in  important 

infections and may help to explain the appearance and evolution of the different 

MRSA  lineages  [6].  Many  different  molecular  typing  methods  have  been 

developed for MSSA and MRSA genetic relevance study, such as phage typing 

[7],  pulsed  field  gel  electrophoresis  (PFGE)  [8];  multilocus  sequence  typing 

(MLST)  [9],  polymorphism  of  protein  A  gene  (spa  typing)  [8]  and  accessory 

gene regulator gene (agr typing) [10]. 

The  pathogenesis  of  S.  aureus  infection  is  very  complex  and  worthy  of 

making  further  research.  Biofilm  formation  can  impair  the  action  of  both  the 

host  immune  system  and  the  antimicrobial  agent,  which  represents  one  of  the 

most  important  survival  mechanisms  of  bacteria  persistently  colonizing  the 

extracellular  niche  [11].  S.  aureus  can  produce  a  wide  range  of  extracellular 

toxins,  virulence  factors,  several  exfoliatins  and  enterotoxins,  which  represent 

risks  for  humans  and  animals,  as  they  are  associated  with  severe  infections.

Nevertheless,  S.  aureus is also known to penetrate, survive, and even multiply 

within  a  large  variety  of  eukaryotic  cells,  such  as  the  epithelial  cells  of  the 

mammary gland or the immune cells [12]. This survival within the intracellular 

niche  protects  the  bacteria  from  the  antibiotics  commonly  used  in  mastitis 

treatment, and also enables them to persist in the host for a long time without 

causing apparent inflammation [13, 14].   

The aim of the present work was thus to identify S. aureus strains gathered 

in  2014  from  bovine  mastitis  milk  in  Jiangsu,  China.  S.  aureus  strains  were 

studied further through agr-typing, MLST, antimicrobial susceptibilities, biofilm 

production and an invasion assay.   

2. Materials and methods 

2.1. Sample collection   

In our study, samples were  collected  from three dairy farms, located in the 

north, center, and south areas, respectively, of Jiangsu Province in the year 2014. 

The three farms represent typical dairy production practices in each region. Milk 

samples  were  taken  from  cows  with  clinical  mastitis,  which  manifested  as 

decreased  milk  production,  color  change  of  the  milk,  and  inflammation  of  the 

udder. Cotton swabs soaked in 70% ethanol were used to disinfect the surfaces 

of teats. The first few streams of milk were discarded. Then a milk sample was 

collected into a 10-ml sterile plastic tube. The collected samples were kept in a 

cooler with ice and transported to the laboratory within 8 hours. 

2.2. Bacterial isolation and identification 

Isolation  and  identification  of  S.  aureus  were  performed  according  to 

China’s National Technical Standard GB4789.10-2010. After incubation at 37°C 

for  24  h  on  Baird-Parker  agar  plates  with  5%  egg  yolk  and  tellurite  (BPA, 

Beijing  Land  Bridge  Technology  Ltd.,  Beijing,  China),  up  to  two  presumptive 

colonies (black colonies surrounded by 2–5-mm clear zones) were selected from

a S. aureus-positive milk sample. Putative S. aureus isolates were further tested 

for  hemolytic  and  coagulase  activities,  followed  by  PCR  to  identify  the  S. 

aureus specific gene nuc1 [15]. All bacteria were routinely confirmed by the API 

STAPH® identification system (bioMe´rieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France). 

S.  aureus  strains  were  tested  for  methicillin  resistance  using  the  disc 

diffusion  method  outlined  in  the  Clinical  Laboratory  Institute  Standards 

guidelines CLSI (M100-S25, 2015). Moreover, the mecA gene, which has been 

shown to confer methicillin resistance to S. aureus (MRSA), was also detected 

by PCR using primers described previously [16]. Only when the isolates  were 

both mecA positive and cefoxitin resistant, which can be classified as MRSA. 

2.3. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing   

Antimicrobial  resistance  was  determined  by  agar  disk  diffusion  tests  on 

Müeller-Hinton agar plates according to CLSI (M100-S25, 2015). In the agar disk 

diffusion  tests,  the  isolates  were  tested  against  a  total  of  13  antimicrobials  as 

follows: penicillin (P, 15 µg), ampicillin (AMP, 10 µg), azithromycin (AZM, 15 µg), 

cephalothin  (KF,  30  µg),  cefotaxime  (CTX,  30  µg),  ciprofloxacin  (CIP,  5  µg), 

clindamycin  (DA,  2µg),  gentamicin  (CN,  10  µg),  kanamycin  (KAN,  5  µg), 

ofloxacin (OFX, 5 µg), streptomycin (STR, 10 µg), tetracycline (TET, 30 µg) and 

sulfamethoxazole  (SXT,  25  µg).  In  addition,  susceptibility 

tests  against 

vancomycin were performed using an MIC method according to CLSI guidelines. 

The standard reference strains S. aureus ATCC29213 and ATCC25923 served as 

quality control strains in every test run. 

2.4. Genomic DNA extraction   

A single colony of S. aureus was inoculated into LB culture medium, and 

the  culture  was  shaken  overnight  at  37°C.  Then  the  culture  was  used  for 

preparation of  genomic  DNA using the TIANamp Bacteria DNA Kit (Tiangen 

Biotech Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

2.5. agr genotyping 

The  agr  allele  types  (Ⅰ-Ⅳ)  were  determined  by  multiplex  PCR  as 

described [17]. In brief, multiplex PCRs were performed on 2 µl of DNA using 

Taq DNA polymerase (Yeasen Biotechnoligy Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China) and 1 

µM of each of the following primers: Pan (5′-ATG CAC ATG GTG CAC ATG 

C-3′),  agr1  (5′-GTC  ACA  AGT  ACT  ATA  AGC  TGC  GAT-3′),  agr2  (5′-TAT 

TAC TAA TTG AAA AGT GGC CAT AGC-3′), agr3 (5′-GTA ATG TAA TAG 

CTT GTA TAA TAA TAC CCA G-3′), and agr4 (5′-CGA TAA TGC CGT AAT 

ACC  CG-3′).  Amplifications  were  performed  with  the  following  PCR 

programme: 1 cycle at 94°C for 1 min; 26 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 

and 72°C for 1 min; and finally 1 cycle at 72°C for 10 min. All PCR products 

were  separated  using  gel  electrophoresis  on  1.5%  agarose  gels,  stained  with 

ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light.   

2.6. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST)   

MLST was carried out as described previously [9]. Specifically, the MLST 

analysis was conducted by sequencing fragments of seven house-keeping genes 

(arcC,  aroE,  glpF,  gmk,  pta,  tpi  and  yqiL).  Allele  number  and  sequence  types 

(STs)  were 

assigned 

by 

using 

the 

S. 

aureus  MLST  website 

(http://saureus.mlst.net).   

2.7. Biofilm production   

Biofilm  formation  was  evaluated  by  spectrophotometry  in  microplates 

using safranin staining [18]. The quantitative classification of biofilm production 

was based on cut-off values (ODc) and average OD values [19], leading to four 

categories of strains: OD ≤ ODc = not a biofilm producer; ODc < OD ≤ 2ODc = 

weak  biofilm  producer;  2ODc  ≤  OD  ≤  4ODc  =  moderate  biofilm  producer;  4 

OD < OD = strong biofilm producer.

Bovine mammary epithelial cells (MAC-T) were used for in vitro bacterial 

internalization assays as previously described [18, 20, 21].   

2.9. Statistical analysis   

The  antimicrobial  resistance  of  S.  aureus  was  analyzed  using  GraphPad 

PRIM  software  (version  5.02  for  Windows;  GraphPad  software  Inc.).  To 

illustrate  the  evolutionary  relatedness  of  S.  aureus  isolates,  a  population 

snapshot  of  the  comparison  of  the  MLST  results  of  our  sequence  types  (STs) 

with published STs was made using eBURST software, version 3.0 (Feil et al., 

2004). A maximum likelihood tree was constructed with these STs to determine 

phylogenies.  The  best-fit  substitution  model  was determined  using  MEGA  4.0 

[22],  and  the  likelihood  of  each  model  was  measured  with  the  Bayesian 

information  criterion  and  corrected  with  the  Akaike  information  criterion.  The 

TrN93  model  with  a  discrete  gamma  distribution  (zG)  allowing  for  invariant 

sites (zI) was used in the complete genome analysis. 

3. Results 

3.1. Isolation and identification of S. aureus 

Among  the  200  milk  samples  analyzed,  58  (29.0%)  were  positive  for  S. 

aureus, including 26 from Nanjing, 5 from Suzhou and 27 from Yangzhou. Of 

these 58 isolates, 11 isolates (19.0%, 11/58) harbored the mecA gene and were 

resistant to cefoxitin, thus were MRSA. All of these were isolated from a dairy 

farm  in  Yangzhou.  Besides  this,  6  S.  aureus  isolates  (10.3%,  6/58)  showed 

resistance to cefoxitin but did not carry the mecA gene. 

3.2. Antimicrobial resistance phenotypes   

Figure  1  shows  the  susceptibility  of  58  S.  aureus  isolates  to  21 

antimicrobial agents. The most of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin (53/58, 

91.4%) and penicillin (53/58, 91.4%), followed by ciprofloxacin (31/58, 53.4%), 

kanamycin  (24/58,  34.5%)  and  streptomycin  (13/58,  22.4%),  and  to  a  lesser

extent  tetracycline  (11/58,  19.0%),  azithromycin  (10/58,  17.2%),  clindamycin 

(6/58,  10.3%)  and  ofloxacin  (6/58,  10.3%)  (Fig.1).  However,  no  isolates  were 

resistant to cephalothin and vancomycin, and the S. aureus isolates showed low 

resistance  to  cefotaxime  and  sulfamethoxazole  (resistance  rate  ranged  from 

1.7% to 3.5%) (Fig.1). Fifty-five (94.8%) S. aureus isolates were resistant to at 

least  one  antimicrobial  and  the  percentage  of  resistance  to  1–3  antimicrobials 

was  72.4%  (Table  1).  In  particular,  approximately  22.4%  of  isolates  was 

resistant to ≥ 5 antimicrobials (Table 1).   

Fifty-five  resistant  S.  aureus  isolates  belonging  to  20  drug-resistance 

patterns  were  identified,  with  the  most  frequent  being  resistant  to  AMP  CIP 

KAN P (15/55, 17.3%), and 9 MRSA isolates belonged to this drug-resistance 

pattern (Table 1). In addition, other resistance patterns such as AMP P (11/55, 

19.0%)  and  AMP  CIP  OFX  P  (5/55,  9.1%)  were  also  wide  spread.  Though 

various  resistance  patterns  were  identified,  certain  drugs  resistance  (such  as: 

AMP,  CIP,  KAN,  P)  were  found  in  different  resistance  patterns.  In  addition, 

four strains isolated from Suzhou were resistant to eight antibiotics (AMP AZM 

CIP CN DA P S TET) (Table 1).   

3.3. agr-typing and MLST   

Through multiplex PCR, the agr alleles were successfully identified in 58 

isolates. All of the isolates were classified as agr I (Table 2). From the MLST 

results,  seven  different  ST  patterns  were  identified  among  the  58  S.  aureus 

isolates  (Table  1).  ST630  and  ST188  were  the  prominent  STs  in  this  study, 

represented by 24 and 18 S. aureus isolates respectively, followed by ST97, ST6 

and ST71, while one strain displayed ST1 and one strain displayed ST5 (Table 

1).   

With the less stringent group definition of 5/7 shared alleles, five clusters 

of linked STs CC (clonal complex) were displayed in the snapshot, along with

two unlinked STs (Fig.2). Through cluster analysis, four clonal complexes CC1, 

CC5,  CC97  and  CC188 were  found.  ST97  was  the  primary  founder  of  CC-97 

and ST-71 was one of the SLVs (single-loucus) of it. CC-97 was the largest CC 

with  21  SLVs.  However,  we  also  found  an  uneven  distribution  of  STs  in  the 

three  cities  and  each  city  had  its  own  particular  STs.  For  example,  ST97  and 

ST6  were  only  found  in  Nanjing,  while  ST630  and  ST71  were  identified  in 

Yangzhou (Fig.2). 

Phylogenetic  trees  revealed  the  relationship  between  our  ST  types  with 

other ST types identified in mastitis milk in China (Fig.2). By cluster analysis, all 

unique STs were separated into two big clusters and our ST types (isolates from 

Jiangsu)  all  belonged  to  A  clusters,  including  most  of  the  mastitis-related  ST 

types in China (Fig.3). ST-97 was closely related to ST-71 in A clusters, which 

were widely distributed in China, except Shandong province (Fig.3). It also had 

the nearer evolutionary  distance with the clinic and subclinical  mastitis -related 

ST types in Xinjiang, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Neimeng. The genetic relationships 

among other STs in both clusters were far, especially ST-2166, which had the 

farthest genetic distance with other ST types in B cluster (Fig.3). 

3.4. Biofilm production   

In TSBglc, only three strains (5.2%) did not produce any biofilm, while the 

majority were biofilm producers, respectively weak (n = 1, 1.7%), moderate (n = 

7, 12.1%) or strong (n = 47, 81.0%) producers (Table 2).   

3.5 Invasion assay 

We  observed  that  54  strains  (93.1%)  showed  an  invasion  rate  lower  than 

1% of the initial inoculum, while only four strains (6.9%) showed an invasion 

rate greater than 1% (Table 2). We found that these four strains showed a high 

invasion rate in MAC-T cells, formed no or a weak biofilm in TSBglc. In contrast, 

most  strains  showed  a  low  invasion  rate  in  MAC-T  cells  and  formed  a  strong

4. Discussion 

Many previous studies showed that members of the genus Staphylococcus 

were the major causative agent of bovine mastitis in China (Cao et al., 2010; Liu 

et al., 2007). In this study, we characterized 58 S. aureus isolates from bovine 

mastitis  milk  samples  collected  from  Jiangsu  province  in  China.  The  overall 

prevalence of S. aureus contamination was approximately 29.0%. This result is 

higher than that of a previous study conducted in China [4] and other developing 

countries,  such  as  Turkey  and  Brazil  [6,  23].  Moreover,  the  S.  aureus 

contamination rate was higher than that in developed European countries and the 

United  States  [24,  25].  Different  sampling  seasons,  sampling  procedures,  and 

isolation methods could affect the S. aureus prevalence results. Better sanitation 

in  cow  fairy,  use  of  preharvest  surveillance  and  control  of  S.  aureus  may 

account for the lower contamination rates in developed countries. 

Antimicrobial resistance in S. aureus has become a significant public health 

concern. The antimicrobial resistance level in our study was relatively high. In 

the  present  study,  the  highest  rates  of  antimicrobial  resistance  were  against 

ampicillin  and  penicillin  (both  91.4%),  which  are  the  most  widely  used 

antimicrobials  in  the  treatment  of  bovine  mastitis.  This  result  was  somewhat 

expected  and  agreed  with  previous  reports  from  China  and  Brazil  [3,  26]. 

However,  the  high  rate  of  ciprofloxacin,  streptomycin  and  ofloxacin  resistance 

observed in this study is of concern. These antimicrobial agents are still widely 

used in human therapy in China because of their low cost and ready availability. 

Therefore,  resistance  to  these  antimicrobials  by  foodborne  pathogens  may 

generate problems for human disease treatment. 

Our results indicated that 94.8% of the S. aureus isolates were resistant to 

at least one antimicrobial agent. Thirteen out of 58 staphylococcal isolates were

resistant to five or more antimicrobial classes including most of the commonly 

used antimicrobials in the region (Table 1). These results were similar to those 

previously  reported  in  China  [4,  5].  However,  several  clinical  studies  have 

reported lower levels of antimicrobial resistance among mastitic S. aureus in the 

United States and in European countries [27]. The uncontrolled use of antibiotic 

in the region could be a reason for the spread of multidrug-resistant isolates. In 

chronic and localized infections like mastitis, this may largely be dependent on 

the  bacterium’s  ability  to  form  biofilms  in  which  bacterial  cells  can  evade  the 

antibiotic  and  host  defenses  employed  to  inhibit  colonization  and  subsequent 

infections [28]. In the present study, most of the S. aureus isolates (47/58, 81.0%) 

were  strong  biofilm  producers.  This  may  be  one  of  the  reasons  why  the 

antimicrobial resistance level was relatively high in our study. Moreover, 90.0% 

of  MRSA  isolates  could  form  biofilms  in  TSBglc.  Importantly,  MRSA  isolates 

that form biofilms also develop resistance to all the commonly used antibiotics 

to which the planktonic bacteria are susceptible . 

MLST  results  revealed  that  ST630  was  the  most  common  genotype  in 

isolates  recovered  from  milk  in  this  study.  According  to  the  S.  aureus  MLST 

database  (http://saureus.mlst.net),  strains  belonging  to  ST630  have  appeared 

only in bulk milk in Japan. ST1 and ST5, reported previously in major human S. 

aureus infections in Asia, Africa and Europe, were found in mastitis milk for the 

first  time  in  our  study.  However,  ST97,  which  were  represented  by  seven 

isolates  in  our  study,  has  been  reported  extensively  in  clinical  and  subclinical 

mastitis  milk  in  multiple  regions  in  China.  ST97  can  form  various  ST  types 

through  active  locus  mutation.  For  example,  ST71  may  have  originated  from 

ST97, and both ST71 and ST97 belong to CC-97, which includes mainly strains 

of  clinical  and  subclinical  bovine  mastitis  all  over  the  world  (Fig.  2).  ST71 

found in this study was reported for the first time in Asia. It was only found in

Europe  and may  appear  from the single-locus mutation of ST97. Phylogenetic 

analyses revealed that the majority of STs in our study all belonged to cluster A 

and  showed  a  close  genetic  relationship  (Fig.  3).  This  supports  the  hypothesis 

that S. aureus is a clonal organism and spreads from cow to cow. In our study, 

isolates  belonging  to  ST630  were  frequently  associated  with  the  ACKP  type 

(resistance to AMP, CIP, Kan, and Penicillin) and all MRSA isolates belonged 

to the ST type. This indicated the frequent emergence of ST630 S. aureus with 

high  resistance  rate  in  China  [2].  The  increasing  prevalence  of  the  MDR  S. 

aureus ST630 clone will pose a considerable threat to the control of clinical S. 

aureus infections.   

Investigation  of  MRSA  from  farm  animals  has  intensified  all  over  the 

world  during  recent  years.  However,  limited  information  is  available  for  the 

genetic  characterization  of  MRSA  from  dairy  cows  in  China  [5,  29].  In  the 

present  study,  using  phenotypic  and  genotypic  methods,  11  MRSA  were 

identified from 58 S. aureus isolates. All these MRSA were found in Yangzhou 

city.  We  have  learned  that  β-lactams  were  widely  used  for  the  treatment  and 

prevention of bovine mastitis in this farm. Although effective, the massive use 

of these antimicrobials may exert a selection pressure favoring the emergence of 

methicillin-resistant  S.  aureus  strains.  Meanwhile,  we  also  found  five 

phenotype-positive  MRSA 

isolates,  which  were  mecA  negative.  The 

mecA-negative but phenotype-positive MRSA have been previously reported in 

Turkey  and  India  [30,  31].  Recently,  the  presence  of  mecA-negative  MRSA 

strains in bovine milk samples has also been reported in China [32]. In our study 

the mecA-negative MRSA strains showed high levels of antimicrobial resistance, 

and  possessed  a  multi-drugs  resistant  phenotype  AMP  CIP  OFX  P  (Table  1). 

However,  most  of  the  previous  studies  were  based  on  genotype  tests  for 

identifying MRSA, which may misidentify these isolates as methicillin-sensitive

S.  aureus  (MSSA)  and  underestimate  the  true  prevalence  of  MRSA.  Thus,  a 

combination  of  genotypic  and  phenotypic  tests  is  necessary  to  avoid  false 

positive or false negative results in identifying MRSA. 

In the present study, the 58 isolates were classified as  agr  I by multiplex 

PCR (Table 2). This finding agrees with a previous observation, where 88% of 

the bovine S. aureus strains were classified in agr group I [33]. It was revealed 

that the bovine S. aureus strains in Jiangsu area mainly belonged to agr group I. 

Similarly,  a  study  of  human  S.  aureus  showed  that  agr  group  I  was  prevalent 

among clinical strains [34]. The agr group has been frequently associated with 

MAC-T  cell  invasion  and  in  vivo  persistence.  In  fact,  agr  group  I  S.  aureus 

strains  show  a  higher  invasion  rate  than  other  agr  groups  [18].  Moreover,  agr 

group I S. aureus strains, which were cap5-positive but tested negative in vitro 

for CP5 ELISA, showed a high invasion rate in MAC-T cells and formed a weak 

biofilm in TSBglc [18]. However, previous studies have obtained different results. 

They  showed  that  there  was  no  association  of  the  capsular  phenotype  with 

biofilm  formation  of  S.  aureus  strains  from  clinical  bovine  mastitis  [35]. 

Oliveira et al. (2011) suggested that S. aureus invasion levels were not related to 

biofilm formation. In the present study, four strains showed a high invasion rate 

in  MAC-T  cells  and  formed  no  or  weak  biofilms  in  TSBglc.  In  contrast,  most 

strains showed a low invasion rate in MAC-T cells and formed strong biofilms 

in TSBglc. 

The present study describes the epidemiology and characteristic of S. aureus 

from  milk  samples  in  Jiangsu  located  in  the  mid-east  of  China.  However,  the 

study  design  and  in  particular  the  less  number  of  sampling  area  and  samples 

limit the conclusions regarding correlate properties of which may be associated 

with  persistent  mastitis.  Further  research  is  essential  to  using  a  larger  strain 

collection  with  isolates  associated  cow  mastitis  from  more  farms  and  more

The 58 (29.0%) S. aureus strains causing bovine mastitis were isolated from Jiangsu 

of China, and 19.0% was MRSA. 

All of the 58 S. aureus isolates were classified in agr group I. 

ST630 and ST188 were the prominent STs in this study. 

Approximately 22.4% of isolates was resistant to ≥ 5 antimicrobials. 

Most strains showed a low invasion rate in MAC-T cells and formed a strong biofilm 

in TSBglc.
