Abstract. In the current study, the virulence factors in Escherichia coli isolates from bovine mastitis were investigated, 
and the connection between these factors and infection was evaluated using phenotypic and genotypic analyses. Twenty-seven  
E. coli isolates were analyzed, and 2 were shown to produce verotoxin. All isolates had the ability to produce biofilms, although 
at different levels. One isolate was found to be sensitive to the bactericidal activity of bovine serum, 11 were intermediate, 
and 15 were resistant. Some isolates showed resistance to trimethoprim sulfa (9) and ampicillin (4), intermediate resistance to 
neomycin (1) and trimethoprim sulfa (5), and simultaneous resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim sulfa (4). The fimH gene 
was found in all isolates and was associated with other virulence markers: pap (1), stb (8), cs31a (3), stb and vt2 (2), cs31a and 
stb (3), east1 and kps (1), stb and east1 (1), cs31a and east1 (1), and cs31a, stb, pap, and iucD (1). Serogroups were determined 
for 3 isolates: O93:H4, O83:H19, and O15:H11. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 23 isolates belonged to group A and 4 
belonged to B1. The findings revealed that these E. coli isolates are opportunistic pathogens with different virulence factors. 
The results indicate that the pathogenicity route of E. coli in bovine mastitis is not a consequence of 1 specific virulence factor.

Key words: Escherichia coli; mastitis; milk; polymerase chain reaction; virulence factor.

Introduction

Bovine  mastitis  is  one  of  the  most  complex  and  costly  dis-
eases in the dairy industry due to its high prevalence and eco-
nomic losses.39 There is also a potential risk to public health 
because it may transmit zoonoses and food toxin infections.9 
Mastitis triggered by Escherichia coli is usually sporadic, and 
clinical  signs  vary  from  very  severe  or  even  fatal  forms  to 
mild  mastitis41  in  which  cows  have  only  local  signs  in  the 
udder.  While  the  severity  of  the  disease  depends  on  host 
immune response and genetic makeup (“cow factors”),11 viru-
lence of the bacterial strain involved may also play a role.

The E. coli strain that causes mastitis can potentially form 
a  new  putative  pathotype,  mammary  pathogenic  E.  coli,41 
and  make  use  of  the  same  pathogenesis  scheme  used  by 
other extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC). There are, 
however,  many  publications  on  the  absence  of  known 
ExPEC virulence-associated genes and intestinal pathogenic 
E. coli among E. coli mastitis isolates, which indicates that 
there may be different ways to cause mastitis.41

Several  virulence  factors  have  been  detected  in  patho-
genic E. coli. These include toxins, adhesins, invasins, cap-
sule production, the ability to resist serum complement, and 
iron scavenging. Only isolates with successful combinations 
of  virulence  factors  will  be  capable  of  causing  disease.25 
Bovine  mastitis  resembles  a  urinary  infection  in  that  the 
infection ascends and is caused by bacteria from the environ-
ment.  Bacterial  virulence  factors  are  required  to  fight  the 
host’s selection pressure and for the bacteria to colonize, 

multiply and survive in the udder.24 The difficulties of treat-
ing  recurrent  infections  might  be  related  to  the  ability  of 
pathogens to form biofilms, although little research exists on 
biofilms in animals.28

Considering the losses resulting from this disease, the rec-
ognition of E. coli as a highly adaptive organism in different 
niches, the inefficiency of treatment, and the impact of this 
infective agent on public health, the present study aimed to 
investigate the presence of virulence factors in E. coli isolates 
from bovine mastitis in an attempt to correlate these character-
istics and establish a possible connection with mastitis.

Material and methods
Escherichia coli isolates and serology

The  current  study  involved  7  dairy  farms  located  in  the 
Viçosa and Juiz de Fora regions in the State of Minas Gerais, 
Brazil. Mastitis was defined by classical symptoms. All cows 
with symptoms of acute clinical environmental mastitis were

Escherichia coli from clinical mastitis

examined  by  veterinarians  who  diagnosed  the  illness. 
Animals showed repetitive episodes of illness, without death. 
One pooled milk sample was aseptically collected once from 
each selected animal, yielding a total of 27 samples. The col-
lections  were  performed  before  treatment  with  antibiotics. 
One E. coli isolate was obtained from each sample using a 
previously  published  protocol.22  The  samples  and  controls 
were kept in brain heart infusion (BHI)a with glycerol (10%) 
at –80°C until analysis. Each culture was streaked onto BHI 
agar plates (37°C for 24 hr), and a single colony was inocu-
lated in BHI and incubated at 37°C by shaking until achieve 
turbidity  similar  to  tube  1  on  the  McFarland  scale,  corre-
sponding to approximately 3 × 108 colony forming units per 
ml (CFU/ml). All isolates were submitted to serological test-
ing  using  somatic  (O1-O172)  and  flagellar  (H1-H50)  anti-
sera as previously described.19

Verotoxin production

The cultures were analytically tested to verify verotoxin pro-
duction  using  a  previously  described  method36  with  some 
modification of the use of essential medium,b with 1.6 mg/l 
penicillin,  0.4  mg/l  streptomycin,  and  5%  fetal  bovine 
serum.b  The  morphological  changes  were  evaluated  at  24 
and 48 hr of incubation. Verotoxin-producing isolates were 
characterized  by  initial  cell  rounding  and  shrinkage,  fol-
lowed  by  loss  of  cell  viability.  The  positive  controls  used 
were E. coli O157:H7c and E. coli J2d for vt1 and vt2 genes, 
respectively.

Antimicrobial resistance
The disc diffusion method,3 with modifications described by 
the  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards  Institute  (CLSI),15 
was performed with antimicrobials most prescribed by vet-
erinarians working in regions where the samples were col-
lected: ampicillin and gentamicin (10 μg each), trimethoprim 
sulfa (25 μg), neomycin, cephalexin, ceftiofur, and florfeni-
col  (30  μg  each),  and  cefoperazone  (75  μg).  The  zones  of 
inhibition were measured, taken as the average of triplicates, 
and compared with the break points presented in the Table 1, 
adapted from CLSI.14,15 The quality control strain used was 
E. coli American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 25922.

Resistance to lytic activity of serum complement
A turbidimetric assay33 was employed to test the resistance 
of the cultures to serum bactericidal activity. Escherichia 
coli strain J-96 was used as the positive control. The iso-
lates that showed optical density at 630 nm (OD
) values 
below 50% of the initial value were considered sensitive to 
the bactericidal activity. Isolates with OD
 values above 
90%  of  the  initial  value  were  considered  resistant,  and 
those that remained between these values were considered 
intermediate.

Biofilm production

570

Quantification of biofilm production in plastic microplates 
was performed as previously described.43 The OD
 of each 
well was measured using a microplate reader,e and the means 
of the triplicates were calculated. The isolates were classi-
fied  as  non-producers,  weak,  moderate,  or  strong  biofilm 
 
producers based on OD of the isolates and the average OD570
of the negative control, according to the methodology used.43 
Brieﬂy,  the  cut-off  OD  (ODc)  was  deﬁned  as  3  standard 
deviations  above  the  mean  OD  of  the  negative  control. 
Strains were classiﬁed as follows: OD ≤ ODc = no bioﬁlm 
producer, ODc < OD ≤ 2 ODc = weak bioﬁlm producer, 2 
ODc < OD ≤ 4 ODc = moderate bioﬁlm producer, and 4 ODc 
< OD = strong bioﬁlm producer.

Polymerase chain reaction

Virulence marker genes were detected by polymerase chain 
reaction  (PCR)  at  the  Laboratory  of  Bacterial  Antigens  II, 
Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Instituto de 
Biologia,  Universidade  Estadual  de  Campinas  (Campinas, 
São Paulo, Brazil; Table 2). The major E. coli phylogenetic 
groups (A, B1, B2, and D) were determined by triplex PCR 
as described previously.13

Results

Only 2 cultures, E. coli 25 and 3888, showed an ability to 
produce verotoxins, which was confirmed by the presence of 
the  vt2  gene.  For  these  cultures,  initial  cell  shrinkage  and 
rounding,  followed  by  loss  of  cell  viability  was  observed. 
The most significant cytotoxic effects were observed at the 
lowest filtered dilution and at 48 hr of incubation.

The ability to form biofilms in vitro was detected in all of the 
isolates, but at different levels of production. Five isolates

were considered as strong producers, 11 were moderate pro-
ducers,  and  11  were  weak  biofilm  producers  (Table  3). 
Among the tested antimicrobials, resistance was observed to 
trimethoprim sulfa (9) and ampicillin (4), and intermediate 
resistance was observed to neomycin (1) and trimethoprim 
sulfa (5). Four isolates were resistant to both ampicillin and 
trimethoprim sulfa (Table 3). According to the growth pat-
terns  observed  in  bovine  serum,  the  isolates  were  divided 
into 3 groups depending on their resistance to lytic activity: 
sensitive, intermediate, and resistant. Only 1 isolate, E. coli 
54, was sensitive, 11 were intermediate, and 15 were resis-
tant (Table 3). Serotyping was only possible for 3 cultures, 

which were identified as O93:H4, O83:H19, and O15:H11 
(Table 3). Somatic antigen identification was possible for 4 
isolates (O12, O15, O83, and O93), and flagellar identifica-
tion was possible for 16 isolates (H2, H4, H7, H9, H11, H19, 
H20, H21, H23, H31, and H48). The flagellar antigen H23 
was identified in 3 isolates, followed by H7, H19, and H48 in 
2 isolates each, and the other flagellar serogroups were found 
in 1 isolate.

The E. coli isolates were classified in the following phy-
logenic  groups:  23  isolates  belonged  to  group  A  and  4  to 
group B1 (Table 3). The fimH gene was the only virulence-
associated gene detected in all of the isolates. None of the

cnf,  cldt,  pap,  afa,  sfa,  saa,  ehly,  hly,  or  ipaH.  All  of  the 
remaining  genes  were  detected  in  combination  with  fimH 
and others. The combination of fimH and sta genes was the 
most frequent, found in 8 isolates. Full details of the other 
gene combinations detected are presented in Table 4.

Discussion

In the current study, 7.5% (2/27) of the isolates were cyto-
toxic in Vero (African green monkey kidney epithelial) cell 
culture,  confirmed  by  molecular  detection  of  the  vt2  gene 
(Table  4).  Earlier  studies4,34  have  also  detected  a  low  fre-
quency of verotoxin producers obtained from mastitic milk 
and a greater predominance of the vt2 gene in relation to vt1. 
Verotoxin-producing  strains  or  Shiga  toxin-producing  are 
considered to be pathogenic to human beings if other factors 
are associated with this virulence.26

Simultaneous resistance was observed for only 2 antibiot-
ics, ampicillin and trimethoprim sulfa, in 14.8% of the iso-
lates, a common resistance profile in E. coli isolates in other 
studies.27,37 In contrast, a high level of antimicrobial resis-
tance to many antibiotics and an elevated number of multi-
resistant  strains  among  mastitis-associated  E.  coli  strains 
have  been  reported  in  an  earlier  Brazilian  study.34  Similar 
reports  of  high  levels  of  resistance  to  antimicrobials 
exist.1,27,37 The findings of the present study suggest that, on 
the  properties  sampled,  there  may  not  have  been  selective 
pressure caused by antibiotic use.

The current study found that 55.5% of the isolates were 
resistant to serum. However, the isolates with intermediate 
behavior (40.7%) may be considered as “potentially” serum-
resistant, expanding the resistance profile to almost all of the 
isolates since only 1 was considered as authentically sensi-
tive. An earlier study30 found serum-resistant isolates (64%) 
and related the different values found in other studies to possible 

variations in methodologies and serum concentrations used. 
There  is  disagreement  in  the  literature  on  whether  serum 
resistance is an important virulence factor in mastitis E. coli 
isolates and if there is a correlation between serum resistance 
and  antimicrobial  resistance.2,20,29  In  the  present  study,  no 
relationship between serum and antimicrobial resistance was 
observed.

Biofilms in animals are believed to be involved in many 
diseases,  such  as  mastitis.28  All  of  the  tested  isolates  were 
able to produce biofilms in vitro. Recurrent clinical coliform 
mastitis can also occur as a result of the persistence of the 
organism within the mammary gland,10 and the production 
of  biofilms  can  provide  suitable  conditions  for  the  persis-
tence of bacteria at this site.

Several studies have attempted to correlate virulence fac-
tors  with  the  etiology  of  bovine  mastitis.4,24  The  results 
obtained in the present study showed a combination of differ-
ent virulence factors in the E. coli isolates (Table 4). The most 
common adhesins found in both commensal and pathogenic 
E.  coli  isolates  as  well  as  in  other  enterobacteria  are  type  1 
fimbriae (fimH gene), and these have influence on biofilm for-
mation.44 The finding was consistent with the current study, as 
the fimH gene was detected in all isolates studied.

An  earlier  study17  failed  to  detect  virulence  factors  in  
E.  coli  associated  with  persistent  bovine  mastitis,  among 
these the stb and pap genes, unlike the current study where 
both these genes were detected. The cs31a gene (afimbrial 
adhesin  cs31a)  has  not  been  commonly  detected  in  earlier 
studies of mastitis-linked E. coli.24 In contrast, in the present 
study, this gene was detected in 8 out of 27 isolates. In the 
present work, only 3 isolates had the east1 gene, a gene pres-
ent in enteroaggregative E. coli8 as well as E. coli isolated 
from cattle with septicemia and diarrhea.5

The  majority  of  isolates  (24/27)  in  the  present  study 
belong to phylogenetic group A (Table 3), where most com-
mensal strains are grouped.6,23 It was anticipated that the iso-
lates  of  E.  coli  obtained  from  bovine  mastitis  milk  would 
belong to group B2 or D, the virulent extraintestinal strain 
groups.6,23 Farm animal E. coli microbiota are characterized 
by a high proportion of A and B1 strains and a lower propor-
tion of B2 and D strains.18

The results obtained in the present study indicate that the 
pathogenic role of E. coli in bovine mastitis is not a conse-
quence of specific virulence factors. Based on the virulence 
factors examined, it was not possible to group these isolates 
into pathotypes able to cause mastitis. Further studies using 
other  virulence  factors  are  necessary  to  elucidate  the  rela-
tionship between the presence of these factors in E. coli iso-
lates  from  mastitis  and  their  classification  in  distinct 
pathotypes and to investigate commensal strains of E. coli as 
possible agents of mastitis.
