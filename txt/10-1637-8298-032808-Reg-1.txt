SUMMARY. Pathogens of free-ranging chickens create a risk of disease for wild birds, some of which migrate to the United
States, as well as potential economic losses for resource-poor farmers. Free-roaming backyard chickens are commonly kept in shade-
grown coffee plantations, habitats that attract large numbers of wild birds. The husbandry and pathogen prevalence of backyard
chicken flocks in San Luis, Costa Rica, were investigated. Based on serologic evidence, Newcastle disease virus, infectious
laryngotracheitis virus, infectious bronchitis virus, chicken anemia virus, and infectious bursal disease virus, as well as both
Mycoplasma gallisepticum and Mycoplasma synoviae, appear to be significant diseases of this population, and thus, we consider these
backyard chickens potential reservoirs for these diseases. There was no evidence of avian influenza. Interviews, clinical examinations,
and microscopic examination of tissues led us to believe that poxvirus is also a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in these
chickens. We found that Escherichia coli isolates were resistant against tilmicosin, tetracycline, ampicillin, amoxicillin with
clavulanic acid, ticarcillin, and cephalothin, and contained genes considered responsible for conferring tetracycline resistance.
Additionally, although production was not measured, we suspect that husbandry and lack of preventative medicine are directly
related to the diseases reported, all of which negatively affect production.

RESUMEN. Las parvadas de aves de traspatio representan un riesgo de enfermedad para las aves tropicales en Costa Rica.
Los pato´genos de las aves de traspatio generan un riesgo de enfermedad para las aves silvestres, algunas de las cuales migran a los
Estados Unidos, generando a su vez potenciales pe´rdidas econo´micas para granjeros de escasos recursos. Las aves de traspatio criadas
a la intemperie son comu´nmente mantenidas en plantaciones de cafe´ con abundante sombra, un habitat que atrae un gran nu´mero
de aves silvestres. En San Luis, Costa Rica, se investigo´ el manejo y la prevalencia de pato´genos en aves de traspatio. Basado en
evidencia serolo´gica, los virus de la enfermedad de Newcastle, laringotraqueitis infecciosa, bronquitis infecciosa, anemia infecciosa
aviar y enfermedad infecciosa de la bolsa, ası´ como el Mycoplasma gallisepticum y el Mycoplasma synoviae, son agentes causantes de
enfermedades en esta poblacio´n y en consecuencia se consideran a estas aves de traspatio como reservorios potenciales de estas
enfermedades. No se encontro´ evidencia de influenza aviar. Entrevistas, exa´menes clı´nicos y evaluaciones microsco´picas de tejidos
nos llevan a creer que el virus de la viruela aviar es tambie´n una causa significativa de morbilidad y mortalidad en estas aves. Se
demostro´ que los aislamientos de Escherichia coli eran resistentes a la tilmicosina, tetraciclina, ampicilina, amoxiciclina y a´cido
clavula´nico, ticarciclina, cefalocina y contenı´an genes considerados responsables de conferir la resistencia a la tetraciciclina.
Adicionalmente, aunque no se midio´ la produccio´n, se sospecha que las pra´cticas de manejo y la falta de medicina preventiva esta´n
directamente relacionadas con las enfermedades reportadas, todas capaces de afectar negativamente la produccio´n.

proactive, comprehensive examinations of risk factors that could affect
further emergence of diseases. In response to his recommendations, we
aim to understand how specific human-altered systems and
introduced avifauna can affect disease dynamics for wild birds. Costa
Rica is one of the hot spots of the world’s biodiversity (54). The
highlands of the Republic of Costa Rica harbor the greatest avian
species richness in Central American montane forests and one of the

highest levels of avian endemism in the world (35). The Monteverde
region, in the northwestern part of the country, is the second top eco-
tourist destination, attracting visitors specifically seeking its natural
beauty and rich avian biodiversity (10). However, outside of protected
reserves, the landscape continues to be deforested for agricultural use,
an activity that threatens the status of neotropic migrants and resident
avifauna in a variety of ways. Preservation of avian biodiversity in this
region should, therefore, be a priority, both from an economic and
conservation standpoint. One conservation incentive heavily promot-
ed is the creation of shade-coffee parcels, considered forest-surrogate
habitat, as they provide floristically and structurally diverse habitat,
positively affecting avian biodiversity. Nevertheless, they might also
pose disease risks by artificially concentrating and aggregating birds to
areas rich in food resources and exposing them to invasive species—
such as the domestic chicken. We hypothesized that free-ranging
backyard chickens could serve as disease reservoirs for susceptible wild
bird populations.

Backyard chicken flocks have begun to receive attention because of
their role in the epidemiology of avian influenza in Asian countries
and are currently being closely scrutinized in many countries
(6,8,70,71,75). Additionally, game chicken flocks have been involved
in outbreaks of economically significant diseases, such as Newcastle
disease, leading to the slaughter of many birds and to expensive
biosecurity efforts (11,27). Although the export of poultry products by
Central American countries is small, and mostly confined to trade
within the region, Costa Rica is Central America’s principal poultry
exporter and is currently marketing to the United States, explaining
Costa Rica’s efforts to be declared Newcastle disease–free (73).
Backyard flocks can act as potential reservoirs for diseases that can
affect commercial poultry operations, especially of diseases that have
become rare in these operations (40,75). A recent review by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) has recommended examining
backyard chicken flocks near commercial operations more closely
(52). Despite disease concerns and typical maintenance of backyard
chicken flocks similar to those in this study across the developing
world, there is a paucity of published information regarding the
pathogen prevalence and diversity of backyard chickens, particularly
in Latin America (31,33,36,42,60,62). According to the Costa Rican
Poultry Association (Musmanni, pers. comm.),
large commercial
poultry operations are well established in Costa Rica, but backyard
flocks are still very common, with a majority of families in rural areas
primarily dependent on poultry for their sustenance. Poor preventa-
tive medicine negatively affects production, and information on the
health and disease status of backyard chicken flocks is needed to
generate recommendations that benefit rural communities.

Here, we present the results of a disease survey conducted with the
objective of determining whether free-ranging backyard chickens
inhabiting shade-grown coffee parcels pose a source of pathogens for
wild birds that share these habitats. In addition, we aimed at
determining the baseline antimicrobial resistance pattern of fecal
bacterial isolates as a model for studying microbial distribution patterns
and transmission in this habitat. During the course of the study, it
became obvious that the health and disease prevalence of backyard
chickens is also important to people participating in sustainable
agroforestry incentives and to nearby commercial poultry operations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study area. The study took place in the town of San Luis
(10u16957.1170N, 84u47953.7470W), 7 km southwest of
the well-
known Monteverde region in northwestern Costa Rica, which housed
approximately 60 rural families. The landscape of this region comprises

a small residential area, a cooperative farm that contains shade-grown
coffee plantations, pasture, and a mixture of primary and secondary
tropical, premontane forest fragments. The flocks selected for this study
were either located within shade-grown coffee plantations or were
immediately adjacent to such plantations (Fig. 1).

Study subjects, interviews, and examinations. The 151 chickens
(Gallus domesticus) from 13 flocks were randomly captured for physical
examination and biologic sample collection during three separate time
periods in July 2005, November 2005, and February 2007. All chicken
owners were interviewed in Spanish during the sampling procedure by
the one of us (S. M. H.-D.).

A physical exam was performed by palpation of

the pectoral
musculature to gauge body condition (scored on a scale of 1 to 5: 1 5
emaciated, 2 5 thin, 3 5 ideal, 4 5 overweight, 5 5 obese), the presence
and degree of mite infestation was subjectively scored (as low 5 ,50
mites/wing, moderate 5 50–150 mites/wing, or severe 5 .200 mites/
wing), and any visible abnormalities were noted. If animals had a body
condition of 2/5 or less, showed severe levels of mites, or had any other
physical abnormalities or clinical signs, they were considered abnormal.
Biologic sample collection and disease surveillance. Blood was
collected from 151 chickens. A thin blood smear was made immediately,
dried, stained with Wright’s stain, and examined for the presence or
absence of hemoparasites (69). At least five fresh fecal samples were
collected from each flock, preserved in a 2.5% potassium dichromate
solution, and examined microscopically, first directly, and subsequently,
by standard flotation technique with Sheather sugar solution (69).
Ectoparasites were collected and stored in 70% ethanol
for later
identification using morphologic characteristics. Serum was collected
and maintained at 280 C until processing. Serum samples were tested
using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA;
IDEXX Inc., Westbrook, ME) for avian pneumovirus (APV), infectious
laryngotracheitis (ILT), infectious bursal disease (IBD), avian enceph-
alomyelitis virus (AE), chicken anemia virus (CAV), Newcastle disease
virus (NDV), avian influenza (AI), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV),
Mycoplasma gallisepticum, (MG), and Mycoplasma synoviae (MS) at the
School of Veterinary Medicine, Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica
(Heredia, Costa Rica), or at
the University of Georgia, Poultry
Diagnostic and Research Center (PDRC; Athens, GA).

Choanal swabs were collected from 21 birds for MG and/or MS
nucleic acid detection. DNA was extracted using a commercial available
QIAamp Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), following the manufacturer’s
recommendations. The DNA was frozen at 270 C until processing.
MG DNA was detected with a Real-Time TaqManH polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR), and MS DNA was detected with a PCR assay
described by Lauerman et al. (7,46)

Cloacal swabs from nine birds from three flocks were collected and
prepared for virus isolation by inoculating chickens embryos. The
allantoic fluid was tested for hemagglutinating activity, and the samples
were placed on FTAH classic cards (Whatman International Ltd, Kent,
U.K.)
for the molecular detection of Newcastle disease virus, as
previously described (58).

Fresh fecal samples were collected, and fecal bacteria was propagated
on MacConkey media plates and incubated at 37 C for 12–18 hr.
Individual colonies were introduced into stable storage media (0.2%
tryptone, 0.02% yeast extract, and 0.5% agar in distilled water) and
maintained at 4 C until export. Once in the United States, bacteria was
streaked for reisolation onto both blood and MacConkey agar plates and
incubated at 35 6 2 C for 12–18 hr to confirm purity. Bacterial
identification was done through standard biochemical reactions (triple
sugar iron, motility, indole, ornithine, oxidase, and citrate) or with
commercially available Enterobacteriaceae identification strips (API 20E;
bioMe´rieux USA, Durham, NC). Minimum inhibitory concentrations
(MIC) were determined using TREK diagnostic system plates (Trek
Diagnostics, Cleveland, OH), following the manufacturer’s instructions
(9), for MIC plates containing a series of titrations of 13 different
antibiotics. Resistance breakpoints were determined based on previously
published data (55). Whole-cell templates were made of pure culture
stock of lactose fermenters (64). PCR was used to identify the samples
that contained drug-resistant genes, such as the class I integron (int1)

and tet(A) and tet(B), as previously described (3,29,56). A list of the
primers used is summarized in Table 1. Fourteen chickens, which
belonged to 12 owners, were examined and humanely euthanatized. A
gross necropsy was performed immediately after euthanasia. For each
animal, a representative sample of all organs was collected and preserved
in 10% buffered formalin until examination.

All biologic samples were prepared for importation following USDA
guidelines for pathogen inactivation and were imported into the United
States under a USDA import permit and a Ministry of Agriculture of
Costa Rica (MAG) export permit. All of the work was approved by the
University of Georgia’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

RESULTS

Interviews and examinations. Chickens were the responsibility
of the women in the household, and they were maintained primarily

for personal use of the meat and eggs and for breeding. Five flock
owners indicated they ‘‘sometimes’’ obtained some chickens from
the MAG. Chickens distributed by MAG are vaccinated against
NDV, IBD, IBV, and pox virus. Chickens foraged within the
boundaries of the owner’s properties but frequently entered nearby
farms or forest fragments throughout the day and were penned in
rustic coops at night. The chickens primarily foraged for food but
were also provided with kitchen scraps, crops (i.e., bananas), cracked
corn, and commercial poultry rations, which did not contain
antimicrobials or coccidiostats. None of
routinely
vaccinated their chickens.

Owners reported an average 5%–20% mortality rate of chicks
during the first 4 wk, primarily from diarrhea and respiratory signs,
and an annual mortality rate of 0%–17% in their adult birds. The
disease syndromes owners perceived as the most important and that
caused mortality in the flocks were a Newcastle disease–like

syndrome, fowl pox, respiratory disease, and an undetermined acute,
anemia syndrome. Upon examination, the percentage of abnormal
physical findings in the chickens from each flock varied from 43% to
99%. Abnormalities found were severe mite infestations (42%;
range, 28%–100%); thin body conditions (67%; range, 14%–
100%); respiratory signs
(13%; range, 0%–25%); evidence of
current or previous pox lesions on head, face, or legs (1%); loss of
normal leg scales (100% in animals .2 yr of age).

Disease surveillance. The results of tests for NDV, ILT, IBV,
and APV and for MG, and MS are presented in Tables 2, 3,
respectively. Of the 128 chickens tested, 72 had a signal-to-noise (S/
N) ratio of 0.029–0.700 and were considered positive for CAV,
whereas 56 had an S/N ratio between 0.700 and 0.921 and were
considered negative. Of
the 151 ELISA extended-range titers
acquired for IBD, 33 were ,1000, 17 were between 1000 and
1999, 41 fell between 2000 and 3999, and 60 were .4000.
Interpretation of antibody titers depends on many factors, such as
type of vaccine (e.g., live vs. inactivated), level of challenge in the
field, and host immune status. Based on previous experience with the
clinical significance of antibody titers in poultry, and the test
manufacturer’s recommendations, we grouped the titer results into
categories such that ,1000 was considered negative or very low,
1000–2000 was low to moderate, 2000–4000 was considered high,
and .4000 was very high. Additionally, 38 birds were tested against
AE, of which, 13 showed antibodies above the manufacturer’s
threshold against AE (34%); however, only two individuals (5%)
from two separate flocks had titers .1500. Of the 118 birds tested
for the presence of antibodies against AI, 12 (10%) showed the
presence of antibody ranges above the manufacturer-recommended
threshold for seropositivity (range, 26–1495). None of these were
confirmed positive by agar gel immunodiffusion. The hemaggluti-
nation test performed with the allantoic fluid obtained from
embryos after three passages was negative for NDV. Additionally,
paramyxovirus nucleic acid was not detected via PCR in any of the
samples tested. Twenty-one birds from six flocks were tested via RT-
PCR for MG, which was detected in six samples (29%), and of the
21 birds tested by regular PCR for MS, it was detected in 14 (67%)
of the samples.

No hemoparasites were found in the 96 blood smears examined.
Direct and flotation techniques on 65 fecal samples from 13 flocks
yielded 1) Eimeria oocysts (Eimeria tenella, Eimeria acervulina,
Eimeria brunette, and Eimeria necatrix) in 46% of samples; 2)
nematode ova, identified as capillarids (54%), Dispharynx sp. (8%),
and Ascaridia galli (20%); and 3) cestode eggs consistent with
Raillietina sp. (42%). More than one species of parasite was present
in 86% of the samples examined. Two species of mites collected
were identified as a wing mite, Pterolichus obtusus, (Robin; family
Pterolichidae), and a body mite, Megninia cubitalis (Megnin; family
Analgidae). The lice collected were the shaft louse, Menopon gallinae
(Linnaeus; family Menoponidae); a wing louse, Lipeurus caponis
(Linnaeus; family Philopteridae); and Oxylipeurus dentatus (Sugi-
moto; family Philopteridae).

Of the fecal samples collected, only those that yielded bacterial
isolates that were lactose fermenters were analyzed; therefore, the
results discussed are from 48 isolates. The majority of
lactose
fermenter isolates were identified as Escherichia coli (91.6%), and the
remaining isolates were other genera in the group Enterobacteriaceae
(8.4%). The antibiotic-resistance profile and the prevalence of gene
presence are represented on Tables 4, 5. Specifically, the presence of
resistance-conferring genes
that displayed
phenotypic resistance against
tetracycline, are represented on

Fourteen chickens from 12 owners were submitted to complete
pathology examinations. In general, all animals were found to have
moderate-to-severe ectoparasite infestations (mites, lice), evidence of
mild-to-moderate endoparasitism, and poor body condition, and all
birds older than 1 yr of age were found to have moderate-to-severe
dermatitis of the lower legs from Knemidocoptes sp. infestations.
Parasites found during gross necropsy and microscopic examinations
were consistent with Capillaria spp., Ascaridia spp., Heterakis spp.,
protozoal organisms consistent with Eimeria necatrix, and flagellates
consistent with Tetratrichomonas gallinarum. Significant gross and
microscopic findings included 1) subcutaneous heterophilic granu-
lomas containing branching hyphae, of which, pure, heavy growth of
Aspergillus clavatus, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus fumigatus was
cultured (n 5 2); 2) hyperplastic epithelium with ballooning
degeneration and large eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions
consistent with poxvirus (n 5 2); 3) lymphocytic sinusitis highly
suggestive of MG (n 5 1); 4) splenic lymphoid atrophy, suggestive
of immunosuppressive agents (n 5 2); 5) ovarian adenocarcinoma (n
5 1); 6) anthracosis (n 5 10); and 7) lymphocytic myocarditis and
epicarditis, suggestive of reovirus (n 5 2). Minor findings included
1) protozoal typhlitis (n 5 4), and 2) mild-to-moderate parasitic
enteritis (n 5 8).

DISCUSSION

Free-roaming chickens are at a disadvantage compared with
commercial poultry for maintaining their health because they do not
receive vaccinations nor are they afforded treatments
typically
applied to commercial poultry. These chickens are on a poor plane
of nutrition and run in flocks of mixed ages, placing susceptible
younger chicks in contact with adults that are potential reservoirs of
disease. Additionally, most commercial poultry breeder flocks are
maintained free of certain infectious diseases that can be transmitted
from the hen to progeny. It is likely that the diseases to which these
chickens are exposed, both singly and in combination, are
responsible for the high mortality among the young and the
potentially decreased reproductive success. On the other hand, their

relative low densities, hybrid vigor, and capability to free-roam away
from excrement may prevent
them from suffering from more
substantial clinical disease. Lack of education, geographic isolation,
and cost of veterinary services preclude the owners in this community
from applying standard preventative-medicine protocols. Morbidity
and mortalities reported are directly linked to the lack of preventative
medicine and lack of shelter and to keeping chickens of different ages
in the same group and allowing the introduction of new individuals
into the flock (4) Owners reported sporadic deaths from a ‘‘chicken
plague,’’ which, based on the history and clinical signs, the high
prevalence of NDV antibodies among the population, and the
elevated antibody titers against NDV, led us to conclude was most
consistent with outbreaks of Newcastle disease.

At least one report indicated that poxvirus is not uncommon in
backyard chicken flocks in the United States (32) Given the lack of
vaccination, the presence of insect vectors, and the clinical and
microscopic examination findings in this study, we suspect that
poxvirus will continue to be an important cause of decreased
production in these flocks. Although pox viruses are typically host-
specific, there is a possibility of recombination of chicken and
passerine poxvirus strains, which could affect virulence.

Given our serology results and interviews, it is likely that the
respiratory syndrome described by owners is caused by NDV, IBV,
mycoplasmosis, or ILT. Tumors caused by Marek’s disease or avian
leukosis or other conditions causing severe anemia might explain the
other syndrome owners reported as anemia, weight loss, and death,
because at
the birds necropsied exhibited splenic
atrophy, often associated with immunosuppressive agents
like
Marek’s, chicken infectious anemia, or IBD.

The USDA and the Office International des Epizooties consider
Costa Rica a country free of exotic Newcastle disease, but the status
of backyard chickens is unknown (73). Worldwide, NDV has the
potential to cause morbidity and mortality and has been detected in
a variety of wild birds (27,30,41,43,48). Of those relevant to this

Gilchrist (25) provides a recent comprehensive review of wild bird
susceptibility to NDV. Of particular concern would be other
members of the Galliformes, of which, certain species are frequently
observed in shade-grown coffee plantations or in immediately adjacent
forest fragments, such as three members in the family Cracidae, and
one in the family Odontophoridae. In this region, there are six
Columbiformes inhabiting shade-grown coffee parcels, one of which
is considered rare. Five species of psittacines, highly coveted by
ecotourists, make use of coffee parcels. Because of the feeding ecology
of members of the Galliformes and Columbiformes, contact with
chickens or their excrement is considered likely. For example, one of
the authors (S. M. H.-D.) has observed Inca doves (Columbina inca)
and white-tipped doves (Leptotila verreauxi) feeding with chickens
(68). Pigeon paramyxovirus (PPMV-1) antibodies were detected from
a variety of wild birds, with the highest frequency during a regional
outbreak of PPMV-1 in white-collared doves (Streptopelia decaocto) in
Florida, suggesting that this virus had spread to other wild birds. Both
that study (72) and the Gohm et al. (27) serosurvey of wild birds
during an NDV epizootic illustrate the subtlety with which this virus
circulates in natural populations.

Close inspection of the birds with titers .4000 for IBV indicated
that they did not originate from flocks where owners reported
acquiring birds from the MAG, and we would consider those titers
significant. Seropositivity against IBV has been reported in wild
birds, such as pigeons (2). Jimenez et. al. (38) reported on the
widespread distribution of IBV in Costa Rica, a similar prevalence
(42%) in the backyard poultry they examined, and the prevalence of
IBV antibodies in free-ranging Columbiformes, including species
that routinely inhabit shade-grown coffee plantations. Again, the
aforementioned wild birds in the orders Galliforme and Columbi-
forme would be considered at highest risk.

Because these backyard chickens were not vaccinated against ILT,
the 65 birds with titers .1000 were likely previously infected with
virus. Currently, Costa Rica is experiencing sporadic outbreaks of
ILT in its commercial operations, in which more than 50% of the
animals are seropositive (Jimenez, pers comm.). Therefore, it appears
that ILT could also be a significant disease for this population of
backyard chickens. ILT has been reported in members of Phasanidae

and Numididae, but

speculated that

Based on serology and PCR, these chickens were also infected
with MG and MS. It appears that Mycoplasma sp. diseases are
common in backyard chicken flocks (36). The DNA presence of
Mycoplasma mimicked the antibody seroprevalence. All of the birds
in which MG nucleic acid was detected were less than 1 yr of age,
and although the sample size in this study precluded us from
definitively investigating the relationship between age and antigen
detection, we
juveniles harbored more MG
organisms. At least one study (24) states that lower quantities of
MG DNA are found in older birds. MG causes respiratory disease in
a variety of wild birds (22,50,51), and a variant associated with
poultry and turkeys has caused population declines from conjunc-
tivitis and mortality of house finches and other members of
Fringillidae (13,18). There are 134 species of Passeriformes that
inhabit this region, of which, at least 74 regularly inhabit shade
coffee plantations, and of those, 18 species forage primarily on the
ground and could be considered at risk (Hernandez-Divers, unpubl.
data). Twenty-five of the common Passeriformes in shade-grown
coffee parcels are North American migrants that rely heavily on
surrogate habitat.

Because 56% and 40% of chickens had titers consistent with
infection with CAV and IBD, respectively, it appears these diseases
are also common in this population of chickens. Antibodies against
IBD have been reported in a variety of wild birds (37,57). Of
relevance to our study are birds in the genera Corvus and Columba,
although antibodies have been found in other members of the
Passeriformes (25). As this virus causes immunosuppression, clinical
disease might be expressed in terms of secondary infections, leading
to indirect causes of mortality (e.g., predation).

Multiple infections with a variety of parasites are common in free-
range chickens
in weight, egg
production, and longevity of free-roaming chickens from parasitic
disease might not be as apparent, when compared with viral or
bacterial disease, but can be far more significant
(34,59,66).
Coinfections with three species of Eimeria were noted in high
numbers on fecal exams and were associated with clinical disease in
pathologic examinations. Coccidiosis can be a major cause of
mortality among chicks and a cause of morbidity and loss of
condition among adult chickens (53). Except for Knemidocoptes sp.,
which caused visible irritation and dermatitis, the other mites and lice
recovered are host-specific and not considered particularly pathogenic.
A subtle, yet

relationship
(12,16). Although parasitic infections are generally host-specific,
some important exceptions exist. For example,
in addition to
members of the Galliformes, both Dispharynx sp. and Capillaria sp.
are nematodes that have the capability of infecting a variety of
Passerine hosts (20,61). Although nematodes found in chickens have
always been considered host-specific, Syngamus trachea, for example,
has been reported in a variety of wild birds (44). In fact, preliminary
data have demonstrated Syngamus sp. ova in wild passerines inhabiting
these plantations (Hernandez-Divers, unpubl. data). Dispharynx sp.
has been reported to cause clinical disease in wild birds and might be
an important pathogen for nestlings (61). At least one study suggests
that Ascaridia galli infections in nonchicken hosts had been acquired
from chickens (19). Areas with large concentrations of fecal material,
such as chicken-feeding stations and corrals, are typical in shade-
grown coffee parcels and can provide a focus of fecal contamination
for the environment and for intermediate hosts (26).

in understanding this

interest

The diseases for which these animals were tested also have
significant economic importance for the poultry industry, a rising

industry in Costa Rica (63). There is one large commercial poultry
operation approximately 20 km from San Luis. Although biosecur-
ity is stringent in these operations, it is important for the Costa
Rican authorities to be aware of the diseases free-roaming chickens
harbor,
in case of a biosecurity breach that might lead to an
epizootic.

coli

foci

isolates

The addition of chickens to the Monteverde landscape is likely to
have an effect on environmental bacterial populations. In particular,
we were concerned that antibiotic-resistant plasmids carried by
chicken phenotypes would be available for horizontal
transfer,
for exchange of bacterial
making shade-coffee plantations
genetic material. The poultry literature reports antimicrobial
resistance patterns
for commercial operations, and within the
context of antimicrobial use (1,5,14,67). With the exception of
sporadic, individual-animal use of oxytetracycline by three owners,
the chickens in San Luis are not routinely exposed to antimicrobials,
and we did not find a significant difference in the prevalence of
tetracycline resistance among those flocks that had been exposed to
oxytetracycline and those that were not. Even though this study
supports the premise that isolates from free-range chickens display
lower tetracycline resistance than found commercial operations, the
resistance is still significant (1,12,67). This is supported by the
presence of resistance genes tet(A) and tet(B). A variety of genes have
been found to mediate resistance to tetracycline; however, tet(A) to
tet(E) are the most prevalent elements found in tetracycline-resistant
E. coli isolates, and within that group, the majority of resistance
appears to be derived from tet(A) and tet(B) (56). Current reports in
the literature describe higher prevalence of antimicrobial resistance
in isolates from wild birds associated with human-disturbed habitats
than from birds that are not exposed to human-associated activities.
For example, E.
(Larus
ridibundus), nesting in agricultural regions of the Czech republic,
displayed a 19% resistance to tetracycline, whereas only 7.6% of E.
coli isolates from rooks (Corvus frugilegus), nesting in remote regions,
were resistant to tetracycline (15,49). A recent study (65) of the
antimicrobial resistance of E. coli isolated from wild birds in the
Arctic reported low prevalence (8%) but proposed that migratory
birds were the vehicles for transport of resistance genes. Class I
integrons, contained within mobile DNA elements, have been
shown to be of
importance in the transmission of antibiotic
resistance in chickens and a useful tool for studying antimicrobial-
resistance transmission (29,47). The prevalence of intI in our isolates
was much lower than previously reported in chickens (29). In
addition, no resistance gene cassettes were found, by PCR, integrated
in the few integrase positive isolates. Thus class 1 integron does not
appear to play a significant role in the resistance we observed but
remains a potential vehicle of antimicrobial-resistance transmission.
In our study, either tet(A) or tet(B), but not both, was likely
responsible for the recorded tetracycline resistance in the E. coli
isolates. The results we obtained do not support the theory that
antimicrobial use is the primary selection mechanisms responsible
for resistance but do seem to demonstrate that there is a pool of
resistance genes in this population, not necessarily selected through
direct antimicrobial use either therapeutically or subtherapeutically
in the feed or water. This pool of resistance genes not only poses a
threat to the wild bird population but also can be used as a model of
microbial transmission within habitats, as has been done in previous
reports (28)

highly mobile backyard chickens and their pathogens. In accord with
Friend et al.
from an ecologic
perspective, to focus more attention on disease issues as direct and
indirect causes of declining avian populations. Unfortunately, disease
investigations in wild birds are often undertaken only following a
massive mortality event or on highly endangered species, and they
typically focus on mortality alone,
ignoring subtle, sublethal or
indirect effects caused by one or a combination of diseases. The
prevalence and diversity of pathogens of the wild birds sympatric
with backyard chickens is currently being investigated (Hernandez-
Divers, unpubl. data). Although, to our knowledge, no visible
mortality events of wild birds have occurred as a result of the
introduction of backyard chickens in forest-surrogate habitats, we
suggest that if wild birds become infected with the aforementioned
diseases, there are likely fitness trade-offs to individuals that are
associated with infection and immune defense against viruses and
parasite loads, which may translate to effects on population
dynamics through indirect and sublethal effects (45,46). Addition-
ally, free-range chickens can serve as reservoirs for antimicrobial-
resistance bacteria, which could be disseminated to birds using shade
coffee plantations. Recognizing the need for creating more available
habitat
sustainable agroforestry
incentives, such as shade-grown cacao, are the wave of the future
(21,26). Thus, studies understanding the disease dynamics of wild
birds inhabiting these forest-surrogate habitats to determine their
significance as foci of risk for diseases will motivate policy changes
for conservation organizations.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

We would particularly like to acknowledge the chicken owners and
the San Luis community. Without their trust and enthusiasm, this
project could not have been realized. Specifically, we would like to thank
Adan Fuentes, our field assistant and community liaison. We would like
to thank the UGA San Luis Research Station for providing lodging and
logistic support. This project was
funded by a National Science
Foundation Graduate Student Fellowship. Harmony Seahorn (Poultry
Diagnostic Research Center, UGA), Nate Chenoweth (College of
Veterinary Medicine, GA), Natasha James (UGA), and Rocio Cortes
and Jorge Prendas (Universidad Nacional, CR) provided instrumental
technical assistance.
