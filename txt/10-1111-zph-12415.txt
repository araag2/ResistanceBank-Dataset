Summary
This study was conducted to estimate the apparent prevalence of Salmonella spp. in 
birds kept under backyard system in Entre Ríos, Argentina, and determine the perfor-
mance of two selective plating media used for Salmonella isolation, and the antimicro-
bial  resistance  of  the  isolated.  Also,  the  association  of  farms  characteristics  with 
Salmonella presence was evaluated. A total of 657 backyard chickens and 15 gooses 
were sampled one time by cloacal swab, belonging to 51 and one family farms, respec-
tively, and four counties in Entre Rios state from April 2014 to May 2015. Only four 
samples from backyard chickens belonged to three family farms from Uruguay County 
were positive to Salmonella spp., so the apparent prevalence was 0.6% for this kind of 
chicken.  Four  serovars  were  isolated  (Salmonella  ser.  Lille,  S.  ser.  Newport,  S.  ser. 
Enteritidis and S. ser. Rissen), which were susceptible to all antibiotics tested with the 
exception of erythromycin. For Hektoen enteric agar and brilliant green agar, relative 
specificity and positive predictive value were 1, and the relative sensitivity and nega-
tive predictive value did not show any difference between them. The agreement was 
very good between these two plating media. None of the variables studied could be 
selected  to  calculate  the  risk  factors  associated  with  Salmonella  isolation  because 
p > .15. Although the prevalence of Salmonella spp. is low in backyard birds in Entre 
Rios, the presence of S. ser. Enteritidis should not be discounted, because it is found in 
the county that concentrates a large population of intensive poultry production in the 
state.

1 | INTRODUCTION
In Argentina, as in other developing countries, there is a sizable back-
yard poultry industry that, together with large- scale commercial pro-
ducers,  supplies  domestic  markets.  The  governments  have  adopted 
a system to breed backyard chickens and give them to low- income 
people so that they can have high- quality protein in their diets (Bonino 
& Canet, 1999). Backyard or free range evokes a positive image of 

chickens living outdoors with plenty of fresh air, sunshine and open 
space to roam in, and they have contact with other animals (Freire, 
Melo, dos Santos Silva, & da Silva, 2005; Kperegbeyi, Meye, & Ogboi, 
2009;  SA  PPLPP,  2009).  Furthermore,  small  poultry  keepers  have 
limited contact with veterinarians and their biosecurity practices are 
poor compared with enterprises. Thus, backyard chickens become a 
possible reservoir for bacteria like Salmonella and sometimes could be

involved in avian disease outbreaks with negative influence in com-
mercial poultry production (Beam, Garber, Sakugawa, & Kopral, 2013; 
Kelly et al., 1994; Manning, Gole, & Chousalkar, 2015). Infected poul-
try flocks are also among the most frequently implicated reservoirs 
of  salmonellae  that  can  be  transmitted  through  the  food  chain  to 
humans. Poultry producers are faced with intensifying pressure from 
public  health  authorities,  elected  officials  and  consumers  regarding 
food safety issues (Gast, 2003).

The genus Salmonella consist of only two species: Salmonella en-
terica  and  Salmonella  bongori.  Salmonella  enterica  is  divided  into  six 
subspecies and more than 2,500 serovars; some of them can be im-
portant pathogens in humans and animals, with varying levels of host 
specificity (Issenhuth- Jeanjean et al., 2014; Singer, Mayer, Hanson, & 
Isaacson, 2009). Fowls are the specific host of Salmonella enterica ser. 
Gallinarum biovar Pullorum and Gallinarum, which cause pullorum dis-
ease and fowl typhoid, respectively. Other serovars with no specific 
host, such as S. ser. Typhimurium and S. ser Enteritidis (SE), may infect 
humans, chickens and other animals (Guard- Petter, 2001).

Cloacal  swabs  or  samples  of  voided  faeces  have  been  used  to 
provide evidence of persistent intestinal colonization by salmonellae 
in individual birds (Gast, 2013). Culture methods are used in labora-
tory procedure recommended for the bacteriological examination of 
Salmonella  in  the  Poultry  Improvement  Plan  of  different  countries 
(Barroso,  2010,  2011,  2012;  National  Agrifood  Health  and  Quality 
Service, 2003, 2016, United States Department of Agriculture, 2017). 
However, the process of isolating Salmonella is to some extend prone 
to failure. Depending on the type of competitive bacteria, detection of 
occasional colonies of Salmonella may be easier if the appropriate plat-
ing medium has been used. Unfortunately, the composition of the flora 
is never known in advance. Therefore, the appropriate plating medium 
may not be used for culture. Numerous agar media are available for 
the isolation of salmonellae (Busse, 1995; Gast, 2013; Soria & Bueno, 
2016).  Furthermore, Antibiotics  are  used  as veterinary  medicine  for 
treatment and prevention of diseases, as prophylactic agents in the 
water of healthy birds and also as growth promoters in low concen-
trations in food (Apata, 2009; Phillips et al., 2004). The efficacy and 
wisdom of medication with these drugs to prevent or treat Salmonella 
infections in poultry are topics of considerable debate because of the 
inconsistent history of these drugs in eliminating Salmonella coloniza-
tion and because indiscriminate veterinary and agricultural uses may 
imperil  their  medical  usefulness  by  promoting  microbial  resistance 
(Gast, 2013; Shivaprasad & Barrow, 2008). The potential risk of ge-
netic exchange that exists in the intestine is one of the reasons that 
explain a zoonotic risk of transfer of resistance (Errecalde, 2004).

There  are  few  studies  of  Salmonella  on  backyard  poultry  in 
Argentina. Although some Salmonella serovars control plan is included 
in the National Poultry Health Plan in Argentina for breeders, broilers 
and hens (National Agrifood Health and Quality Service, 2003, 2016), 
backyard chickens play a significant socio- economic role in poor com-
munities, and their flocks are not usually monitored for diseases or vac-
cinated. Xavier et al. (2011) found that the seropositive family farms 
were between 0% and 66.7% for Salmonella in Entre Rios, Argentina, 
during the period 2003–2007. However, these authors did not try to 

Impacts
•  The  prevalence  of  Salmonella  spp.  is  low  in  backyard 

chickens in Entre Rios, Argentina.

•  Salmonella strains isolated are resistant to erythromycin.
•  Hektoen enteric agar is very similar to Brilliant green agar 
for Salmonella sp. isolation from cloacal swab samples in 
backyard chickens.

isolate this bacteria. It is well recognized that some animals or poultry 
with a positive serological response may no longer be infected with 
Salmonella organisms. Likewise, animals or poultry that are actively ex-
creting salmonellae may be serologically negative (World Organization 
for Animal Health, 2008).

Entre Ríos is a state in Argentina where poultry production is so 
concentrated that, from an epidemiological point of view, it is similar 
to a very large multi- age farm. This state is divided into 17 counties 
(Uruguay County concentrated 31% of the poultry farm and hatcher-
ies) and has almost 3,355 poultry houses, which correspond to 43% 
of  the  poultry  houses  from  Argentina.  It  also  accounts  for  almost 
48.7%  of  the  poultry  production  and  25.2%  of  the  egg  production 
in Argentina (Livestock, Pigs and Poultry Division, 2014, Ministry of 
Agrindustry,  2016). Therefore,  the  present  study  was  conducted  to 
(i) estimate the apparent prevalence of Salmonella in birds kept under 
backyard  system  in  Entre  Ríos, Argentina,  (ii)  determine  the  perfor-
mance of two differential plating media used in a sample for Salmonella 
isolation, and the antibiotic resistance profile of the isolated and (iii) 
study the association of farm characteristics with Salmonella presence 
in these types of farms.

2 |  MATERIAL AND METHODS

2.1 | Study design

A total of 657 backyard chickens were sampled one time by cloacal 
swab from April 2014 to May 2015. These animals belonged to 51 
family farms and four counties in Entre Rios state (Table 1). The num-
ber of cloacal swabs from backyard chickens was based on the follow-
ing equation (Mateu & Casal, 2003), with an expected prevalence of 
50% and a precision of 5% with 99% confidence limit:

n = Z2pq∕B2,

where: n = sample size, Z = 2.56 for 99% confidence limit, p = disease 
expected frequency (0.5), q	=	1	−	p,	B = precision.

Five to 15 samples were taken from each backyard chicken farm. 
Furthermore,  15  gooses  from  another  family  farm  were  sampling 
by cloacal swab. A sterile cotton swab, pre- moistened with sterile 
0.85% ClNa solution, was inserted into the cloaca of each bird and 
rotated gently against the lining of the cloaca to collect a sample. 
Swab from each bird was transferred to an independent sterile tube.

Samples  were  labelled  and  transferred  to  the  INTA  Laboratory  of 
Poultry  Health  (Concepción  del  Uruguay,  Entre  Ríos)  in  ice  chests 
for Salmonella isolation.

2.2 | Salmonella spp. isolation and identification

At the laboratory, 5 ml of tetrathionate broth (Acumedia, Michigan, 
USA) plus supplements (20 ml/L of iodine–potassium iodide solu-
tion—6 g of iodine and 5 g of potassium iodide; 20 ml of demin-
eralized water—brilliant green 0.1 %, Sigma, Steinheim, Germany; 
and 40 mg/ml of novobiocin, Sigma) was added to each tube with 
cloacal swab. After incubation during 18–24 hr at 35 ± 2°C, a loop-
ful of broth was streaked on Hektoen enteric (HE) agar (Acumedia, 
HEA)  and  brilliant  green  (BG)  agar  (Oxoid,  Basingstoke,  UK)  for 
chicken samples, and HE agar (Britania, Buenos Aires, Argentina) 
and  Salmonella  Shigella  agar  (Merck,  Darmstadt,  Germany)  for 
goose  samples,  and  incubated  at  35 ± 2°C  for  18–24 hr.  Two 
presumed Salmonella colonies on each selective–differential agar 
plate  were  biochemically  confirmed  using  triple- sugar  iron  agar 
(Acumedia), lysine iron agar (Merck), Simmons citrate (Merck), sul-
phide indole motility medium (Merck), Jordan’s tartrate agar, phe-
nylalanine agar (Hi- Media, Mumbai, India) and urea agar (Britania). 
If there were no bacterial colonies compatible with Salmonella spp. 
in a selective–differential agar plate, two atypical Salmonella spp. 
colonies were also taken and the same biochemical tests, as men-
tioned before, were carried out. All Salmonella isolations were pre-
served on nutritive (Merck) slants agar until serotyping, which was 
carried out according to the White–Kauffmann–Le Minor scheme, 
with somatic (AgO) and flagellar (AgH) antigens (Grimont & Weill, 
2007).

2.3 | Antibiotic susceptibility test

The antibiotic susceptibility test was performed by the standard disc 
diffusion method in Mueller- Hinton agar (Difco™, Sparks, USA) and 
the  results  were  interpreted  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  of  the 
National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (2013, 2015). 
The isolates were screened for resistance to the following antibiot-
ics: fosfomycin (50 μg); colistin (10 μg); tetracycline (30 μg); florfenicol 

    |  3

(30 μg); enrofloxacin (10 μg); gentamicin (10 μg); erythromycin (15 μg); 
sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim  (25 μg);  doxycycline  (30 μg);  neo-
mycin  (30 μg);  cephalothin  (30 μg);  norfloxacin  (10 μg);  amoxicillin 
(10 μg);  kanamycin  (30 μg);  ciprofloxacin  (5 μg);  chloramphenicol 
(30 μg);  cefotaxime  (30 μg);  streptomycin  (10 μg);  and  fosfomycin/
tylosin  (160 μg/40 μg).  All  the  antibiotic  discs,  except  fosfomycin/
tylosin (FOSBAC PLUS T- BEDSON™, Britania), were purchased from 
Oxoid. The zone diameter breakpoint used for fosfomycin/tylosin was 
the same as fosfomycin.

2.4 | Analysis of the performance criteria for  
selective–differential culture media and statistical  
analysis

Relative  accuracy  (RAc),  sensitivity  (RSe),  specificity  (RSp),  positive 
predictive  value  (RPPV)  and  negative  predictive  value  (RNPV)  and 
agreement  (kappa  coefficient  and  McNemar’s  test)  of  HEA  and  BG 
agar,  used  for  Salmonella  spp.  isolation  from  chicken  cloacal  swab 
samples, were analysed according to Soria, Soria, Bueno, and Colazo 
(2011). For isolation methodology, relative true positive was defined 
when a sample was positive to Salmonella spp. in at least one differ-
ential–selective agar. Relative true negative was defined as samples 
where Salmonella spp. was not detected in any differential–selective 
agar.  Kappa  coefficients  were  summarized,  according  to  Dawson 
and Trapp (2004), as an excellent agreement (.93–1.00), a very good 
agreement  (.81–.92),  a  good  agreement  (.61–.80),  a  fair  agreement 
(.41–.60),  a  slight  agreement  (.21–.40),  a  poor  agreement  (.01–.20) 
and no agreement (<.01). Z test was used in order to test the statistical 
significance of kappa coefficients. On the other hand, McNemar’s test 
was calculated using a chi- square approximation at p	≤	.05	(GraphPad	
Software, 2017).

2.5 | Relationships between different variables in a 
family farm and Salmonella presence

Data  concerning  the  general  characteristics  of  the  family  farm,  the 
feeding, watering and sanitary practices and the measures taken for 
Salmonella  control  were  also  collected.  The  questionnaire  (related 
to  10  topics),  consisting  of  questions  of  which  most  of  them  were 
close- ended (dichotomous or multiple choice), was filled out by the 
investigator during an interview with the farmer. Closed- ended ques-
tions were designed based on biosecurity measures for poultry farms, 
according to the Argentinean National Agrifood Health and Quality 
Service regulation 542/2010 (2010) and the resolution No. 52/2005 
from  Entre  Ríos  General  Directorate  of  Animal  Production  (2005). 
Information from the questionnaires was coded and put in a database 
(Excel,  Microsoft  Cooperation).  Data  were  analysed  using  infostat 
Software (Di Rienzo et al., 2014).

Each farm was considered a unit. A two- step statistical procedure 
was used to assess the relationship between the different variables 
(taken from the survey) and the Salmonella status in the farm sampled. 
All potential risk factors were tested by univariate analysis and only 
variables with a p < .15 were selected (Fisher or chi- square test).

3 |  RESULTS

3.1 | Apparent prevalence of Salmonella in backyard 
poultry in Entre Ríos, Argentina, and antibiotic 
resistance profile of the isolated

Of 657 samples of backyard chickens, only four samples, belonged to 
three family farms from Uruguay County, were positive to Salmonella 
spp. So the apparent prevalence was 0.6%. Twelve Salmonella strains 
were isolated from those positive samples and were typified into four 
serovars (Table 2): Salmonella ser. Lille (4), S. ser. Newport (4), SE (3) and 
S. ser. Rissen (1). S. ser. Lille was isolated from two backyard chickens 
from the same family farm, while S. ser. Newport was isolated from 
two birds from different family farm. Furthermore, two different se-
rotypes were isolated from one chicken in two cases (S. Lille- S. Rissen 
and  S. Newport- SE).  In  reference  to  geese  samples,  Salmonella  spp. 
was not isolated from them. On the other hand, Salmonella isolated 
strains revealed the same resistance pattern. All strains were suscep-
tible to all antibiotics tested with the exception of erythromycin.

3.2 | Performance of two selective–differential 
plating media used in a sample for Salmonella isolation

Overall, four and three samples yield Salmonella spp. on HEA and BG agar, 
respectively. Because of the absence of false- positive samples, the RSp 
and RPPV were 1 for HEA and BG agar. There were not any statistical 
difference between HEA and BG agar in the RSe and the RNPV. The RAc 
was 1 for both selective agar plating. The RSe and RNPV was 1 (.52–1.00) 
for HEA. On the other hand, the RSe and RNPV were .71 (.26–.95) and 
1.00 (.98–1.00) for BG agar, respectively. The agreement (kappa coef-
ficient) was very good (.83) between HEA and BG agar, and McNemar’s 
test showed that the difference between the two plating media was not 
statistically significant, with the two- tailed p- value of .4795.

3.3 | Association of farm characteristics with 
Salmonella spp. in backyard chicken in Entre Ríos,  
Argentina

In relation to 51 family farms studied, 23.5% (12/51) of them use mains 
water. The remaining 76.5% (39/51) uses ground water and from this per 
cent, 15% (6/39) usually disinfects it and makes microbiological analy-
sis, 8% (3/39) does not disinfect it, but makes analysis and 77% (30/39) 
neither disinfects or makes analysis. Backyard chicken feeding includes 
feeds  (44/51),  kitchen  waste  (4/51)  and  homemade  feeds  (3/51).  The 
disposal of mortalities makes by incineration (28/51), using as food for 
animals (3/51), laying far from the farm (6/51), using in a compost system 
(9/51) and buried (5/51). In regard to the proximity of a commercial poul-
try enterprise, 52.9% (27/51) of backyard farms complies the national 
minimum required distance (1,000 m), while 47.1% (24/51) does not, and 
within this per cent, 33.3% (8/24) has both production systems in the 
same place. In respect of the proximity of a pig farm, 68.6% (35/51) of 
the farms complies the minimum state required distance (1,000 m), while 
the  remaining  31.4%  (16/51)  does  not,  and  within  this  per  cent,  60%

(9/15) has backyard poultry and pigs in the same area. None of the farm-
ers has a written biosecurity plan, and only 9.8% (5/51) has veterinary 
assistance. The 74.5% (38/51) of farmers makes rodent control, whereas 
none of them makes fly control. Finally, none of the farmers had reported 
Salmonella outbreaks. The results of the univariate analysis revealed that 
none of the variables studied could be selected to calculate the risk fac-
tors associated with Salmonella isolation because p > .15 (Table 3).

4 |  DISCUSSION

In the present study, the apparent prevalence of Salmonella in back-
yard chickens was 0.6%. The application of rodent control, the use of 
industrial  food  (with  some  microbiological  control)  and  the  distance 
(more than 1,000 m) from a pig and intensive poultry farms in most 
of backyard chicken farms sampled could help to decrease Salmonella 
sp. contamination in these animals. Although it was observed that the 
care  and  health  of  the  birds  was  limited,  coinciding  with  extensive 
breeding  systems  in  Vietnam  (Burgos,  Hong  Hanh,  Roland- Holst,  & 
Burgos, 2007), the low prevalence of our study made it difficult to find 
Salmonella spp. risk factors. Isolation rates for Salmonella sp., using the 
same sample, were 5.8% in Iran (Jafari, Ghorbanpour, & Jaideri, 2007), 
3.5%  in  Paraguay  (Leotta  et al.,  2010),  4%  in  Morocco  (Bouzoubaa, 
Lemainguer, & Bell, 1992), 0.02% in Australia (Manning et al., 2015) 
and 15% in West Bengal, India (Samanta et al., 2014). The difference 
between data could be attributed to the presence of different domi-
nant serovars of Salmonella in each of the countries, and hence differ-
ent rates of infection and shedding, differences in the general standard 
of  health  of  the  chickens  in  each  country  and  biosecurity  practices 
(Manning et al., 2015). It is known that cloacal swabs can provide sen-
sitive indicators of persistent intestinal colonization in individual bird, 
but their diagnostic reliability is diminished by the intermittent shed-
ding of salmonellae in the faeces of infected birds (Gast, 2013).

Reports of the frequency of isolation of Salmonella serovars from 
poultry sources around the world have yielded a wide range of results, 
although several serovars appear to be of continuing international sig-
nificance.  The  unique  epidemiologic  association  of  S. ser  Enteritidis 
with disease transmission via contaminated eggs has made the prev-
alence of this serovar a topic of particular interest (Gast, Guraya, &

Guard,  2013).  Different  authors  reported  that  cloacal  swabs  were 
not the best sample for detection of S. ser Enteritidis carriers in com-
mercial layer farms (García, Soriano, Benítez, & Catalá- Gregori, 2011; 
Mutalib, McDonough, Shin, Patten, & Lein, 1992). In our study, this 
serovar was only isolated from one sample, indicating that this serovar 
is present, but with low incidence.

    |  5

In  our  study,  Salmonella  strains  were  sensitive  to  18  antibiotics 
tested,  and  only  resistant  to  erythromycin,  a  macrolide  antibiotic. 
Other authors reported a high resistant of Salmonella strains, isolated 
from poultry farms or clinical and environmental samples, to this an-
tibiotic  (El- Tayeb,  Ibrahim,  Al- Salamah,  Almaary,  &  Elbadawi,  2017; 
Phagoo  &  Neetoo,  2015; Thung  et al.,  2016). Although  the  number 
of Salmonella strains isolated was low in our study and the resistant to 
this antibiotic could be due to improper usage or overuse, it is known 
that  Gram- negative  bacilli,  as  Salmonella  sp.,  are  usually  intrinsically 
resistant to macrolide antibiotics (Chambers, 2006; Nakajima, 1999).

The objective of Salmonella spp. isolation in selective and differential 
plating media is to differentiate and separate the selected or target micro-
organism from the competitive microflora. It is recommended that sam-
ples should always be streaked onto two different media, preferably with 
dissimilar  indicator  systems  for  differentiating  salmonellae  from  other 
organisms. This strategy decreases the number of the false- negative re-
sults, although with a little extra cost (Gast, 2013; Petersen, 1997). In 
our study, we used two selective and differential plating media: BG agar 
and HEA. Velma, Goo, Ching, and Gooch (1973) indicated that BG agar is 
more effective than HE agar in isolating salmonellae from food products. 
The selectivity of the first medium derives from the presence of brilliant 
green dye, lactose and sucrose, which are the basis for the differential ca-
pabilities of the media. Almost all Salmonella fail to ferment either lactose 
or sucrose and their colonies appear either pink to red, with reddening 
of the media (Waltman, 2000). On the other hand, the HE agar uses bile 
salts for selective inhibition and two indicator systems: (i) bromothymol 
blue and acid fuchsine as indicators of carbohydrate dissimilation (involve 
the sugars lactose, sucrose and salicin), and (ii) ferric iron as an indicator of 
the formation of hydrogen sulphide from thiosulphate. Most Salmonella 
do not ferment the three sugars, but produce H2S, which results in bluish- 
green colonies with black centre (Van der Zee, 2003; Waltman, 2000). 
Although BG agar and HE agar use dissimilar indicator systems for differ-
entiating salmonellae from other organisms, we did not find any differ-
ence in Salmonella isolation in both media and the agreement was very 
good between them without any statistical difference.

Temelli,  Eyigor,  and  Carli  (2010)  evaluated  the  Salmonella  sero-
group detection in poultry meat samples by examining multiple col-
onies  from  selective  plates  following  the  FDA/BAM  and  ISO  6579 
methods. They founded multiple serogroups (D and E4; B and C2; C1; 
G; and E1 and F) and concluded that a selective plate for Salmonella 
culture method can harbour more than one serogroup. In our study, 
two different serovars were isolated from one chicken in two cases 
(S. ser. Lille- S. ser. Rissen and S. ser. Newport- SE).

Although the prevalence of Salmonella spp. is low in backyard birds 
in Entre Rios with the isolation technique used, it should not be dis-
counted, as S. ser. Enteritidis isolates were found only in the Uruguay 
County,  which  concentrates  a  large  population  of  intensive  poultry 
production  in  the  state.  On  the  other  hand,  because  all  Salmonella 
strains were only resistant to erythromycin, it is inadvisable to use this 
antibiotic to treat salmonellosis. Finally, the performance of HEA and 
BG agar is very similar for cloacal swab samples, so the combination of 
these two media for this kind of sample does not decrease the number 
of the false- negative results.
