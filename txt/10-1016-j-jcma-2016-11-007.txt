Abstract

Background: Salmonella enteritidis infection is a frequently encountered zoonotic problem, occurring with concerning regularity in recent years
on a worldwide basis. The study that we undertook for the Ô¨Årst time detected S. enteritidis and associated antimicrobial resistance pattern in
broiler chickens.
Methods: A total of 150 different poultry samples were Ô¨Årst enriched and grown on selective media, and then processed for molecular detection
of S. enteritidis by ampliÔ¨Åcation of the spvb gene.
Results: The overall detection rate of S. enteritidis was 23.3% (n ¬º 35), while an increased detection rate of S. enteritidis was found in the
chicken breast tissue (n ¬º 9; 30%). When antibiogram was tested for S. enteritidis against common antibiotics, increased resistance to ampicillin
(n ¬º 29; 82.2%), tetracycline (n ¬º 28; 80%), augmentin (n ¬º 27; 77.14%), and chloramphenicol (n ¬º 19; 54.2%) was observed. Multidrug
resistance was reported in 54.8% (n ¬º 19) of the S. enteritidis isolates, while 20% (n ¬º 07) of isolates were extensively drug resistant.
Conclusion: The present study for the Ô¨Årst time reports S. enteritidis on the basis of spvb gene detection. The increased drug resistance in S.
enteritidis is an emerging problem that could negatively impact efforts to prevent and treat broiler-transmitted S. enteritidis.

1. Introduction

The poultry industry has made a major contribution to the
food sector of Pakistan, and its products are largely consumed
throughout the country in order to meet important protein
dietary requirements. However, there is a potential threat of
bacterial

economic loss.1 Salmonella is the most commonly reported
cause of foodborne disease among bacterial infections.2 It is
estimated that about 94 million cases of gastroenteritis due to
Salmonella species occur annually worldwide,
leading to
155,000 deaths every year.3 Among Salmonella species, Sal-
monella enteritidis is isolated predominantly from poultry and
is the most frequent cause of human nontyphoidal salmonel-
losis.4 In recent years, S. enteritidis has been reported as a
major causative agent of foodborne gastroenteritis in humans.5
The current emergence of drug resistance in S. enteritidis is a
major challenge due to the nonjudicious use of antimicrobial
agents in the food and livestock sector.6 Poultry, especially
broiler chickens, can harbor antimicrobial-resistant strains and

function as a vehicle for dissemination of these pathogens to
humans.7 Standard culture and serological methods for the
detection of S. enteritidis are employed as disease control
measures; however, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a
preferred diagnostic method due to its reliable sensitivity,
speciÔ¨Åcity, and detection speed.8 The spvb gene, commonly
involved in bacterial virulence, is routinely used for the detec-
tion of S. enteritidis.9 As far as literature mining is concerned,
no data exist on the molecular detection and drug resistance
pattern of S. enteritidis from the Kohat region of Pakistan.

The present study has documented for the Ô¨Årst time mo-
lecular detection of S. enteritidis spvb gene and its associated
drug resistance pattern against commonly used antibiotics.
The Ô¨Ånding of this study will be efÔ¨Åcacious in better con-
trolling antibiotic resistance among S. enteritidis isolates from
broiler chicken samples.

2. Methods

2.1. Sample collection and processing

The present study was conducted at the Department of
Microbiology, Kohat University of Science and Technology,
Kohat, Pakistan, during the period from December 2014 to
August 2015. A total of 150 different broiler chicken samples
(30 samples each of heart, liver, kidney, breast tissue, and leg
piece) were collected from different retail markets of three
main areas of Kohat. Random samples were collected from
individual chickens (1 sample from 1 chicken, which means
150 samples from 150 chickens). All the samples were pro-
cessed separately and washed thoroughly with autoclaved
water to avoid any cross contamination between two samples.
The samples were collected in peptone water-Ô¨Ålled sterile
plastic bags and immediately transported on ice to the labo-
ratory for inoculation on enriched medium.

2.2. Isolation and identiÔ¨Åcation of Salmonella species

The culturing method to detect Salmonella species involved
selective enrichment followed by plating on selective agar.
One gram of poultry sample was added to 9 mL of tetrathio-
nate broth and was incubated at 37
C for 24 hours. A loop full
of broth culture from tetrathionate was streaked onto a plate of
bismuth sulÔ¨Åte agar. Bismuth sulÔ¨Åte agar is the selective me-
dium for the growth of Salmonella species. The plates were
incubated at 37
C for 48 hours and checked for the growth of
typical black Salmonella species colonies.





The presumptive colonies of Salmonella species were taken
for further conÔ¨Årmation by biochemical testing, including oxi-
dase, catalase, triple sugar iron slant reaction, motility, indole,
urease, and citrate utilization tests, as described earlier.10

2.3. DNA extraction from bacterial culture

Tris-EDTA buffer. The sample was mixed with lysis solution
C for 5 minutes. Subsequent to incuba-
and incubated at 65
tion, absolute chloroform was added and centrifuged at
12,880 g for 2e3 minutes. Following centrifugation, the upper
aqueous phase was mixed with the precipitation solution and
centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 2e3 minutes. The pallet was
dissolved in NaCl solution and processed for ethanol precip-
itation step. After incubation at e20
C for 10 minutes, the
supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The
ethanol was removed and the DNA pallet was dissolved in TE
buffer. The concentration and quality of DNA was checked
using the Nano-drop equipment (Thermo ScientiÔ¨Åc).



2.4. Molecular detection of S. enteritidis

S. enteritidis, and S1 and S4 genes were detected using PCR
(Gradient Thermal Cycler; Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany).
S. enteritidis was detected by the ampliÔ¨Åcation of the spvb gene
using speciÔ¨Åc primers.9 BrieÔ¨Çy for PCR, 3 mL of DNA was added
to 25 mL of the reaction mixture containing 4 mL prepared master
mix (Deoxynucleotide Triphosphate (dNTPs), 10 PCR buffer,
Taq polymerase, and MgCl2), and 1 mL of forward and reverse
primer, while the remaining 16 mL was equalized by nuclease-
free water. The prepared PCR tubes with the master mixture
were placed in a gradient thermal cycler. AmpliÔ¨Åcation was

carried out with initial denaturation at 95
C for 5 minutes, fol-

lowed by 34 cycles of denaturation (94
C for 1 minute),

annealing (53
C for 1 minute).

A Ô¨Ånal extension step was carried out at 72
C for 5 minutes. The
ampliÔ¨Åed DNA product from S. enteritidis-speciÔ¨Åc PCR along
with the positive control (S. enteritidis) and negative control
(Escherichia coli) were analyzed with 1.3% agarose gels stained
with ethidium bromide and visualized by UV transillumination.

number of Salmonella species identiÔ¨Åed by culture and
techniques was 51 (34%). S. enteritidis was
biochemical
detected in 35 (23.33%) samples among the biochemically
identiÔ¨Åed Salmonella species. The size of the ampliÔ¨Åed spvb
gene was 250 bp (Fig. 1).

In specimen-wise distribution of S. enteritidis that included
different parts (heart, kidney, liver, breast tissue, and leg piece)
of poultry, a higher isolation rate of S. enteritidis was noticed
in breast tissue (n ¬º 9, 30%), while the lowest detection rate
was observed in heart samples (n ¬º 4; 13.3%; Table 1).
When antibiotic susceptibility was checked, most S. enter-
itidis isolates were resistant to ampicillin (n ¬º 29; 82.8%),
tetracycline (n ¬º 28; 80%), and augmentin (n ¬º 27; 77.1%). S.
enteritidis showed resistance to ciproÔ¨Çoxacin (42.8%) and
levoÔ¨Çoxacin (40%); however, it showed less resistance against
third-generation cephalosporins (including ceftazidime, cefo-
taxime, and ceftriaxone; Table 2). MDR and XDR patterns were
also reported among 35 S. enteritidis isolates, in which 25.7%

4. Discussion

Salmonellosis is the primary cause of foodborne diseases
globally.14 A broad range of foodstuff has been associated with
such diseases. However, food from animal sources, especially
if poultry derived, has been implicated in periodic cases and
outbreaks of human salmonellosis.15

In the present study, S. enteritidis was detected in poultry
samples. Moreover, their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern
was also reported. In a total of 150 broiler chicken samples, the
prevalence of S. enteritidis was 23.3%, while an increased
detection rate (30%) was observed in breast tissue. The results of
our investigation are compatible with those of a study conducted
in Faisalabad, Pakistan.4 Another study in Iran also reported 25%
prevalence of S. enteritidis from broiler poultry farms.7

Resistance of Salmonella to antimicrobials is an emerging
problem in developing and developed countries.16 In our study,
S. enteritidis isolates were resistant to commonly used antibi-
otics, i.e., ampicillin (82.85%), tetracycline (80%), augmentin
(77.14%), and chloramphenicol (54.2%), which is in line with
the Ô¨Åndings of Beyene et al,17 in which resistance to ampicillin,
amoxicillin, and chloramphenicol were 75%, 75%, and 50%,
respectively. However, our results are in contrast with the

Ô¨Åndings of the 2010 study of Akhtar et al,4 in which isolates of S.
enteritidis were mostly sensitive to ampicillin, tetracycline, and
chloramphenicol. The notably high rate of antimicrobial-
resistant S. enteritidis strains in this study is probably due to
the early introduction and subsequent widespread use of these
antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine in our area.

The Ô¨Çuoroquinolone-class antibiotics ciproÔ¨Çoxacin and
levoÔ¨Çoxacin showed moderate resistance to S. enteritidis iso-
lates (42% and 40%, respectively); however, a previous study
reported that S. enteritidis isolates were sensitive to cipro-
Ô¨Çoxacin.18 Fluoroquinolone resistance among S. enteritidis
isolates might designate the common use of these antibiotics.
In the current study, S. enteritidis was least resistant to
third-generation cephalosporin. Lower rates of cephalosporin
resistance in this study are consistent with the results of
Abdel-Maksoud et al‚Äôs19 study in 2015, who reported a low
prevalence of cephalosporin resistance among S. enteritidis
isolates from poultry sources. Lower resistance of S. enter-
itidis to cephalosporin is valuable to the community as ceph-
alosporin resistance is a noteworthy public health concern.

Overall, MDR was observed among 54.2% S. enteritidis
isolates. Our Ô¨Åndings are in line with the results of a study by
Hur et al20 in 2011, in which 65.2% Salmonella isolates were
multiple drug resistant. Another study from Brazil also re-
ported 63.9% multidrug-resistant S. enteritidis isolates from
chicken carcass samples.18 However, another study reported a
high prevalence of MDR of 90.9% to Salmonella enterica
serovars Indiana and enteritidis.21 In one recent study, 35.5%
isolates were reported.22 The
MDR Salmonella species
increased MDR isolates can be due to the use of antimicrobial
drugs in poultry food at a subtherapeutic level, which can
promote antimicrobial-resistant strains.23,24

In the current study, elevated levels of S. enteritidis were
detected in broiler chickens. Increased drug resistance was
observed to commonly used antibiotics, which suggests an
emerging problem and could negatively impact an effort to
prevent and treat broiler-transmitted zoonotic S. enteritidis.
