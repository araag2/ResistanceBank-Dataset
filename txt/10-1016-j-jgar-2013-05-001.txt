1.  Introduction

Non-typhoidal  Salmonella  is  one  of  the  most  common  causes  of  human  gastroenteritis  worldwide  and
most  human  outbreaks  are  associated  with  the  consumption  of  contaminated  food.  However,  there  are
no  reports  on  Salmonella  contamination  in  market  meat  in  Laos.  The  objective  of  this  study  was  to
determine  the  prevalence  of  Salmonella  in  meat  samples  in  Pakse,  Champasak  Province,  Laos,  as  well  as
the  antimicrobial  susceptibility  of  isolates.  The  prevalence  of  Salmonella  was  82%  in  beef,  93%  in  pork  and
80%  in  buffalo  meat.  In  total,  80  isolates  and  11  serovars  were  found,  including  serovars  Stanley
(n  =  15),  Anatum  (n  =  14),  Derby  (n  =  11),  Rissen  (n  =  9)  and  Amsterdam  (n  =  7).  The  drug  susceptibility  of  60
strains  against  10  antimicrobial  agents  was  tested.  The  60  isolates  examined  were  sensitive  to  ciproﬂoxacin
(100%  susceptible),  norﬂoxacin  (100%),  cefotaxime  (95%),  nalidixic  acid  (90%)  and  chloramphenicol  (88%),
but  were  resistant  to  streptomycin  (67%  resistant),  tetracycline  (67%)  and  ampicillin  (63%).  Of  the  isolates,
73%  were  multidrug-resistant.  These  ﬁndings  indicate  a  high  Salmonella  prevalence  in  market  meat  in
Pakse.  Therefore,  programmes  to  control  Salmonella  contamination  are  needed.

Diarrhoeal  diseases  are  a  primary  social  and  health  problem  in
developing  countries,  particularly  those  in  tropical  zones.  Non-
typhoidal  Salmonella  is  one  of  the  most  common  causes  of  human
gastroenteritis  worldwide  and  most  human  outbreaks  are  associat-
ed  with  the  consumption  of  contaminated  food  [1].  In  Laos,  there
have  been  few  reports  of  Salmonella  in  humans  and  livestock.  Of  the
880  cases  of  diarrhoea  in  Laotians  between  October  1996  and  August
1997,  only  5  (0.6%)  were  attributed  to  Salmonella  [2].  Other  reports
showed  the  resistance  rate  of  six  isolates  of  Salmonella  enterica
serovar  Weltevreden 
for

to  be  50%  and  33.3% 

in  Laotians 

streptomycin  and  tetracycline,  respectively  [3].  We  have  previously
reported  the  Salmonella  prevalence  in  caecum  samples  obtained
from  slaughtered  buffalo  and  pigs  to  be  8%  and  76%,  respectively  [4].
The  prevalence  of  Salmonella  in  pig  carcass  swabs  at  slaughterhouses
is  relatively  high  (66%)  and  a  large  amount  of  contaminated  meat  is
consumed  daily  [5].  However,  there  are  no  reports  on  Salmonella
contamination  in  market  meat  in  Laos.  The  objective  of  this  study
was  therefore  to  determine  the  prevalence  of  Salmonella  in  meat
samples 
in  Pakse,  Champasak  Province,  Laos,  as  well  as  the
antimicrobial  susceptibility  of  isolates.

Meat  samples  were  purchased  from  a  local  market  with  no
refrigeration  or  freezing  system,  stored  in  a  box  at  1–4  8C  and
immediately  transported  to  Champasak  Animal  Health  Service
Center  (Champasak  Province,  Laos) 
isolation.
Samples  were  analysed  within  3  h  of  collection.  Suspected
isolates  were  then  sent  to  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)
National  Salmonella  and  Shigella  Center  (National  Institute  of
Health,  Nonthaburi,  Thailand)  for  biochemical  and  serological
testing.

for  Salmonella 

2.2.  Isolation  methods

Brieﬂy,  for  isolation  of  Salmonella  spp.,  each  25  g  meat  sample
was  placed 
in  225  mL  of  buffered  peptone  water  (Merck,
Darmstadt,  Germany),  thoroughly  mixed  and  incubated  at  37  8C
for  18  h.  Then,  1  mL  of  pre-enrichment  culture  was  added  to  5  mL
of  Rappaport–Vassiliadis  (RV)  broth  (Merck)  and  incubated  at
42  8C  for  1  day.  After  incubation,  RV  cultures  were  streaked  onto
modiﬁed  semisolid  RV  agar  (Merck)  and  deoxycholate–hydrogen
sulphide–lactose  agar  (Nissui,  Tokyo,  Japan)  and  incubated  at
37  8C  for  18  h.  Typical  Salmonella  colonies  (n  =  1–3)  were  selected
from  each  specimen  for  conﬁrmation  based  on  biochemical
characteristics  [6]  using  triple  sugar  iron  agar  (Nissui),  lysine
indole  motility  agar  (Nissui),  and  catalase  and  oxidase  tests.
Serotyping  of  80  Salmonella  isolates  was  performed  on  the  basis  of
somatic  O  and  phase  1  and  phase  2  ﬂagellar  antigens  by
agglutination  testing  with  antisera  (S&A  Reagents,  Bangkok,
Thailand)  according  to  the  Kauffman–White  Scheme  of  the
‘Antigenic  formulae  of  the  Salmonella  serovars  (9th  ed)’  by  the
WHO  Collaborating  Centre  for  Reference  and  Research  on
Salmonella  (http://www.scacm.org/free/Antigenic%20Formulae%
20of%20the%20Salmonella%20Serovars%202007%209th%20
edition.pdf).

2.3.  Antimicrobial  susceptibility  testing

isolates  were 

tested 

Sixty  strains  of  80  Salmonella 

for
antimicrobial  susceptibility  by  the  disk  diffusion  method  of  the
Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards  Institute  (CLSI)  [7]  using  BD
Sensi-DiscsTM (BD,  Franklin  Lakes,  NJ)  with  Mueller–Hinton  agar
plates  (BD).  Ten  antimicrobial  agents  in  the  form  of  disks  were
employed  for  susceptibility  testing  of  60  Salmonella  isolates  at  the
following  concentrations:  ampicillin  (AMP),  10  mg;  amoxicillin/
clavulanic  acid  (AMC),  30  mg;  chloramphenicol  (CHL),  30  mg;
ciproﬂoxacin  (CIP),  5  mg;  cefotaxime  (CTX),  30  mg;  nalidixic  acid
(NAL),  30  mg;  norﬂoxacin  (NOR),  10  mg;  streptomycin  (STR),
30  mg;  tetracycline  (TET),  30  mg;  and  sulfamethoxazole/trimetho-
prim  (SXT)  (23.75/1.25  mg).  Escherichia  coli  ATCC  25922  was  used
as  the  quality  control  strain.  The  choice  of  the  10  antimicrobials
was  based  on  the  guidelines  of  BD  Sensi-discs  for  Enterobacter-
iaceae  (http://www.bdj.co.jp/micro/products/1f3pro00000qho5o-
att/54-sd-hantei-CLSI.pdf).  Isolates  that  were  resistant  to  two  or
more  classes  of  antimicrobial  agents  were  considered  multidrug-
resistant,  with  SXT  counting  as  one  agent.

3.  Results

3.1.  Salmonella  prevalence  in  samples  examined

All  Salmonella  strains  isolated  in  this  study  were  identiﬁed  as  S.
enterica  subspecies  enterica.  As  shown  in  Table  1,  Salmonella
specimens  were  isolated  from  14  (82%)  of  17  beef  samples,  25
(93%)  of  27  pork  samples  and  4  (80%)  of  5  buffalo  meat  samples.
Eleven  Salmonella  serovars  were  isolated  from  all  meat  samples
examined.

Analysis  of  beef  samples  identiﬁed  nine  Salmonella  serovars.
Salmonella  Stanley  (n  =  8)  was  the  most  prevalent,  followed  by  S.

a Salmonella  enterica  subsp.  enterica  serovar  3,10:-:1,7.

Rissen  (n  =  4),  S.  Derby  (n  =  3),  S.  Anatum  (n  =  2)  and  S.  Give  (n  =  2).
Salmonella  Amsterdam,  S.  Newport,  S.  Weltevreden  and  3,10:-:1.7
were  isolated  from  one  sample  each.  Multiple  serovars  were
isolated  from  7  of  14  positive  samples.

Analysis  of  pork  samples  identiﬁed  seven  Salmonella  serovars.
Salmonella  Anatum  (n  =  12)  was  the  most  common,  followed  by  S.
Derby  (n  =  8),  S.  Amsterdam  (n  =  6),  S.  Rissen  (n  =  5),  S.  Stanley
(n  =  4),  S.  Orion  (n  =  3)  and  S.  Panama  (n  =  2).  Multiple  serovars
were  isolated  from  10  of  25  samples.

Analysis  of  buffalo  meat  samples  identiﬁed  three  Salmonella
serovars.  Salmonella  Stanley  (n  =  3)  was  the  most 
frequent,
followed  by  S.  Orion  (n  =  1)  and  S.  Newport  (n  =  1).  Multiple
serovars  (S.  Stanley  and  S.  Newport)  were  isolated  from  one
sample.

3.2.  Antimicrobial  resistance  of  isolates

Next,  the  antimicrobial  resistance  of  20  isolates  from  12  beef
samples,  35  isolates  from  23  pork  samples  and  5  isolates  from  4
buffalo  meat  samples  was  examined.  Table  2  shows  the  resistance
rates  of  Salmonella  isolates  from  beef,  pork  and  buffalo  meat,  which
serve  as  an  indicator  of  antimicrobial  resistance.  All  60  isolates
examined  in  this  study  were  susceptible  to  CIP  and  NOR.  In  the  20
isolates  from  beef  samples,  resistance  to  STR,  TET,  AMP,  AMC,  SXT,
CHL,  CTX  and  NAL  was  80%,  75%,  70%,  45%,  30%,  15%,  5%,  and  5%,
respectively.  In  the  35  pork  isolates,  resistance  to  TET,  AMP,  STR,
SXT,  NAL,  AMC,  CHL  and  CTX  was  63%,  60%,  57%,  37%,  14%,  11%,  11%,
and  6%,  respectively.  In  the  ﬁve  buffalo  meat  isolates,  resistance  to
STR,  TET  and  AMP  was  80%,  60%,  and  60%,  respectively,  and  all  ﬁve
buffalo  meat  isolates  were  susceptible  to  AMC,  CHL,  CIP,  CTX,  NAL,
NOR  and  SXT.

Table  3  shows  the  antimicrobial  resistance  of  all  11  isolated
Salmonella  serovars.  Among  four  of  the  serovars  examined,  all  S.
Stanley  isolates  showed  resistance  to  AMP,  STR  and  TET,  S.  Anatum

isolates  showed  resistance  to  TET,  S.  Rissen  showed  resistance  to
SXT,  and  S.  Amsterdam  showed  resistance  to  NAL.

3.3.  Antimicrobial  resistance  proﬁles  of  isolates

The  resistance  proﬁles  of  isolated  Salmonella  samples  are  shown
in  Table  4.  The  55  resistant  isolates  comprised  21  resistance
proﬁles.  The  AMP–STR–TET  proﬁle  (n  =  9)  was  the  most  frequent,
followed  by  AMP–AMC–STR–TET  (n  =  7),  STR  (n  =  5)  and  STR–SXT
(n  =  5).  A  total  of  73%  of  the  isolates  (44/60)  were  identiﬁed  as
multidrug-resistant.  The  most  predominant  proﬁle  in  beef  was
AMP–AMC–STR–TET  (ﬁve  strains  of  S.  Stanley  and  one  strain  of  S.
Derby),  in  pork  was  STR–SXT  (four  strains  of  S.  Derby  and  one  strain
of  S.  Rissen)  and  in  buffalo  meat  was  AMP–STR–TET  (three  strains
of  S.  Stanley).

4.  Discussion

This  study  showed  an  overall  Salmonella  prevalence  of  82%  (14/
17)  in  beef,  93%  (25/27)  in  pork  and  80%  (4/5)  in  buffalo  meat
samples  collected  from  retail  meat  shops  in  Pakse.  To  the  best  of
our  knowledge,  this  is  the  ﬁrst  report  regarding  isolation  of
Salmonella  from  retail  meat  shops  in  Laos.  In  retail  meat  shops  in
Vietnam,  ca.  40–62%  of  beef  [8–10]  and  33–70%  of  pork  [8,10–12]
meat  are  Salmonella-positive.  In  retail  meat  shops  in  Thailand,  ca.
41%  of  beef  [13]  and  29–96%  of  pork  [13–17]  meat  were  found  to  be
contaminated  with  Salmonella.  The  isolation  rates  in  Laos  in  the
current  study  are  the  same  or  higher  than  those  reported  in
neighbouring  countries  such  as  Vietnam  and  Thailand;  however,
several  factors  must  be  considered  when  making  such  compar-
isons,  including  differences  in  sampling  season,  sanitation  and
isolation  method.  Previous  reports  showed  that  S.  Anatum  and  S.
Derby  were 
[4,5].
Interestingly,  no  S.  Infantis  was  isolated  in  two  previous  studies

in  Laos  or  in  the  present  study  [4,5],  whereas  S.  Infantis  was
frequently  found  in  humans,  pigs  and  pork  in  European  countries
[18],  the  USA  (http://www.cdc.gov/nationalsurveillance/salmo-
nella_surveillance.html)  [19]  and  Japan  [20,21].  The  high  preva-
lence  of  S.  Anatum  and  S.  Derby  in  pigs  and  pork,  with  no  S.  Infantis,
might  be  characteristic  of  Laos.  The  current  isolates  from  beef,  pork
and  buffalo  meat  in  Laos  showed  no  resistance  to  new  quinolones
such  as  CIP  and  NOR,  but  50%  of  predominant  Salmonella  isolates
such  as  S.  Stanley,  S.  Anatum,  S.  Derby  and  S.  Rissen  were  resistant
to  AMP,  STR  and  TET.  To  date,  reports  have  shown  that  all
Salmonella  isolates  from  meat  and  animals  in  Laos  lack  resistance
to  new  quinolones  [3,4],  which  is  in  agreement  with  the  present
results.  In  general,  many  isolates  are  resistant  to  AMP,  STR  and  TET,
which  constitute  some  of  the  most  widely  used  antibiotics  in
human  medicine  and  veterinary  ﬁelds.  Thus,  the  present  results
were  expected  and  reﬂect 
in  neighbouring
countries  such  as  Vietnam  [9,10,12,15]  and  Thailand  [15,16].

those  reported 

Percentages  of  multidrug  resistance  to  more  than  two  of  the
examined  antibiotics  in  beef  Salmonella  isolates  (n  =  15)  and  in
pork  Salmonella  isolates  (n  =  26)  were  not  statistically  different  (x2
test,  P  =  0.953).  Furthermore,  the  current  results  suggested  that
73%  of  isolates  (44/60)  were  resistant  to  multiple  antibiotics,  which
is  in  good  agreement  with  the  ﬁndings  of  previous  studies  in
Vietnam  [9,10,12,22]  and  Thailand  [16].

When  consuming  meat 

in  the  study  area,  cooking  with
sufﬁcient  heat  to  prevent  cross-contamination  from  raw  meat  to
unheated  food  and  cooking  equipment  is  very  important.  The
present  ﬁndings  may  provide  useful  information  for  treatment  of
patients  and  infected  domestic  animals.  In  May  2010,  the  World
Health  Assembly  approved  the  following  resolution  on  food  safety:
‘Advancing  food  safety  initiatives’  (WHA63.3;  http://apps.who.int/
gb/ebwha/pdf_ﬁles/WHA63/A63_R3-en.pdf).  In  Laos,  programmes

for  food  safety  should  be 
implemented  as  soon  as  possible.
Moreover,  education  on  food  hygiene  and  other  hygiene  practices
should  also  be  promoted.
