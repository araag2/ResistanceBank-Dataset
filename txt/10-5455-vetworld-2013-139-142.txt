Abstract

Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the hygienic quality of foods of animal origin. Thus samples from foods of animal 
origin, viz. mutton, chicken meat, milk and milk products were processed. 
Materials and Methods: Two hundred samples from foods of animal origin viz., mutton, chicken meat, milk and milk 
products were processed for isolation of Escherichia coli. The isolates were got serotyped and also subjected to detection of 
virulence genes viz., stx1, stx2, eaeA and hlyA by PCR.The isolates were also tested against commonly used antibiotics.
Results: The prevalence of E. coli was 30% in mutton, 40% in chicken meat, 33.96% in milk and14.89% in milk products 
samples. All the 60 isolates of E. coli were grouped into 24 serogroups with O60 and O123dominant strains (8.33%) followed 
by O22 (6.66%). The PCR detected 21(10.5%) of samples possessing stx1, 14(7%) stx2, 3(1.5%) both stx1 and stx2, 16(8%), 
eaeA and 4(2%) EHEC-hlyA gene. However, the prevalence of Shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC) was 20% in mutton, 30% 
in chicken meat, 16.98% in milk and 8.51% in milk products. Whereas the prevalence of enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) was 
2%, in mutton, 4% in chicken meat, 7.54% in milk and 2.12% in milk products samples. The 4 isolates O60, O101, O131 and 
one untypeable strain possessed the EHEC-hlyA gene. 22 of 50 (44%) of isolates from meat, milk and milk products showed 
multidrug resistance to four or more antimicrobial comprising ten of 25 (40%) isolates from chicken meat samples and 12 of 
25(48%) from milk and milk products were multidrug resistance to four or more antimicrobial.
Conclusions: It is concluded that partial cooked or raw milk, meat and their products prepared under unhygienic conditions 
may not be directly consumed as they may be carrying the pathogenic microbes.
Keywords: drug resistance, food, prevalence, serogroup

Introduction

Thus the aim of this study was to elucidate the 
presence of E.coli with emphasis on STEC and their 
virulence  determinants  in  food  of  animal  origin  of 
Jammu region.

Among emerging foodborne bacterial pathogens, 
Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is a 
pathogen of concern associated with the change in the 
livestock practices, food processing techniques along  Materials and Methods
with change in food habits of people. The pathogen 
whose reservoirs include the gastrointestinal tract of 
animals  especially  ruminants  viz.,  cattle,  sheep  and 
goats  is  mainly  transmitted  to  humans  through  oral 
route. The oral route of transmission is of significance 
as  various  food  products  viz.,  meat,  milk  and  their 
products derived from animals can be contaminated by 
intestinal contents of animals during production and 
ingestion of inappropriate processed foods and could 
lead to serious complications including haemorrhagic 
colitis  (HC)  or  the  haemolytic  uraemic  syndrome 
(HUS) in children [1,2].

A total of 200 samples from foods of animal origin 
viz.mutton,  chicken  meat,  milk,  and  milk  products 
(ice-cream, kulfi, paneer, milk cake, rasmalai, cream 
roll) were collected (Table-1) from Jammu region and 
processed  as  per  the  standard  microbiological 
techniques [6]. The isolation of E.coli was achieved by 
enrichment in selective E. coli broth and plating on 
MacConkey  agar  (MA).  3-4  lactose  fermenting 
colonies from MA were selected and streaked on EMB 
agar.  The  colonies  producing  metallic  sheen  were 
selected for biochemical identification.
Serogrouping: All  the  E. coli  isolates were serotyped 
from National  Salmonella  and  Escherichia Centre, Central  

In general, the pathogenicity of STEC is governed 
by two phage - encoded cytotoxins called shiga toxins 
viz., Stx1 and Stx2,produced by stx1 and stx2 genes,  Research  Institute,  Kasauli-173204 (H.P) India.
respectively [3]. In addition to these toxins,the presence 
of eaeA gene encoding 'intimin' protein enhances the 
virulence of STEC causing intimate attachment to the 
intestinal epithelial cells [4]. Also, EHEC-hlyA gene 
encoding enterohaemolysin has synergistic effect on 
virulence [5].

stx1, stx2, eaeA and EHEC-hlyAgenes: Primers used in 
the study are listed in Table 2. The template DNA was 
prepared as per the method of Blanco et al. [8] with 
slight modifications. The E. coli isolates were cultured

which is in agreement to this study. 

The 50 isolates from mutton, chicken meat, milk 
and milk products were tested against 15 commonly 
used antimicrobial for the treatment of food animals in 
different  ailments.  It  was  observed  that  22(44%)  of 
isolates were showing multidrug resistance against to 
four or more antimicrobials which is in agreement to 
the study of Altalhi, et al. [12], where the multidrug   
resistance was  40.54%  among the isolates of  E. col 
from  chicken  meat.  However,  84%  of  isolates  were 
sensitive to Cephoxitin, 80% to Chloramphenicol and 
Tetracycline  from  the  chicken  and  mutton  meat 
samples whereas, 76% to Chloramphenicol, from milk 
and milk product samples.  

Antimicrobial  resistance  in  Enterobacteriaceae 
poses a critical public health threat, especially in the 
developing countries [13,14]. Much of the problem has 
been shown to be due to the presence ofTransferable 
plasmids  encoding  multidrug  resistance  and  their 
dissemination among different enterobacterial species [15].
Conclusion

The  direct  consumption  of  raw  milk  meat  and 
their  products  or  raw  meat  and  partially  cooked  or 
prepared under unhygienic conditions remain high risk 
as they may be carrying STEC. More research in this 
behalf is needed to know the presence of STEC in raw 
milk, meat and their products to conclude survival rate 
and heat tolerance during processing and also to know 
the  possibility  of  post  preparation  contamination  of 
products.
