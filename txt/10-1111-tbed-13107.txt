Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) causes high mortality in poultry flocks and often 

is  complicated  with  viral  infections,  leading  to  large  economic  losses;  however,  little 

information  is  available  on  the  epidemiological  characteristics  of  this  pathogen  in  ducks. 

Therefore, a systemic epidemiological investigation was performed on 325 duck farms from 

13 provinces in China during the period of 1 April 2016 until 31 March 2018, covering two 

years.  A  total  of  26  APEC  strains  were  isolated  from  different  farms  in  this  study,  and 

analysis  showed  that  all  of  those  isolates  carried  multiple  virulence-associated  genes  and 

drug-resistance  genes,  which  led  to  high  pathogenicity  (15/26),  strong  or  moderate  biofilm 

formation  (24/26)  and  multidrug  resistant  abilities  (26/26).  On  the  other  hand,  coinfection

with APEC, H9 avian influenza virus (AIV) and Tembusu virus (TMUV) was very common 

on those farms (11/26), with APEC and TMUV sharing a similar morbidity peak (from May 

to September) and susceptibility (60% infections occurred in ducklings); thus, we speculated 

that the emerging TMUV infection escalated the APEC incidence in ducks. Finally, the data 

presented in this report enhance the current understanding of the epidemiology of APEC and 

different viral infections in ducks and provide additional  insight into the critical factors that 

determine  their  pathogenicity.  Meanwhile,  the  emergence  of  multidrug-resistant  APEC 

strains  and  their  coinfection  with  different  viruses  emphasize  that  preventive  measures 

against such infections on poultry farms should be implemented immediately.

Introduction 

Keywords:  avian  pathogenic  Escherichia  coli,  coinfection,  duck,  pathogenicity,  drug 

Avian  pathogenic  Escherichia  coli  (APEC)  is  the  major  etiology  for  avian  colibacillosis, 

including  several  diseases  such  as  pericarditis,  perihepatitis,  peritonitis,  airsacculitis, 

septicemia and other mainly extraintestinal diseases in poultry (Dho-Moulin and Fairbrother, 

1999). Those diseases can induce high morbidity and mortality in ducks of different ages and 

threaten their long-term health (Saif et al., 2003; Wei et al., 2013). However, going from bad 

to worse, avian colibacillosis has emerged in an endless stream with the rapid development of 

the  poultry  industry  and  significant  increases  in  stocking  density,  leading  to  large  losses

(Croxen  and  Finlay,  2010;  Kaper,  2005),  especially  in  China  (Li  et  al.,  2015;  Dou  et  al., 

2016; Wang et al., 2016).   

Initially,  conventional  antibacterial  drugs  played  an  important  role  in  the  control  of  APEC, 

and  the  extensive  use  of  these  drugs  achieved  some  control.  However,  continuous 

indiscriminate use and abuse has led to the emergence of drug-resistant strains of E. coli and 

even to multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains (Tang et al., 2009), which decrease the medicinal 

effects and represent a great challenge to the poultry industry. More importantly, because the 

transmissibility  of  the  drug-resistant  determinants  from  E.  coli  to  other  pathogenic  bacteria 

has  the  potential  to  create  superbugs  and  induce  incurable  bacterial  infections,  the  drug 

resistance of APEC should be a focus of future research (Bass et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2010; 

Dheilly et al., 2013).

On the other hand, the clinical and pathological symptoms of the colibacillosis in poultry are 

complex,  and  often  the  virus  is  complicated  with  additional  viral  infections  (Mosleh  et  al., 

2016).  Epidemiological  investigations  have  shown  that  the  positive  rates  of  H9  avian 

influenza  virus  (AIV),  Tembusu  virus  (TMUV),  Newcastle  disease  virus  (NDV),  duck 

parvovirus (DPV) and  fowl adenovirus (FAdV)  and other pathogens are  universally high in 

different  duck  flocks  (Niu  et  al.,  2017a,  2017b);  coinfection  with  those  viruses,  especially 

with  emerging  TMUV  infections,  could  destroy  the  immune  system  of  ducks,  induce  an 

infection secondary to APEC and produce synergy, thereby resulting in more serious clinical

signs  than  monoinfection,  which  should  draw  much  attention  (Todd,  2000).  Furthermore, 

previous study also has shown that coinfection of APEC with H9 AIV could exacerbate the 

condition of either disease compared to each one alone (Mosleh et al., 2017). 

Therefore,  this  study  investigated  APEC  and  coinfected  viruses  on  325  duck  farms  in  13 

provinces  of  China,  and  the  drug  resistance,  biofilm  formation,  pathogenicity,  phylogenetic 

group,  antimicrobial  resistance  genes  and  virulence  genes  of  APEC  isolated  in  this  study 

were also systemically analyzed to characterize the biological properties and molecular basis 

of  each,  which  can  provide  valuable  information  about  the  epidemiology  of  APEC  in  the 

field.

Sample collection 

and season. 

The study included 1194 clinical liver samples collected from 325 scaled duck farms (Figure 

S1).  The  period  for  sample  collection  extended  over  two  years,  from  1  April  2016  until  31 

March 2018, which allowed investigation of the relationship between the infection prevalence 

The samples analyzed in this study were all collected from duck farms with relatively sound 

breeding  conditions,  and  no  obvious  clinical  symptoms  were  observed  in  those  flocks.  In 

 

addition,  for  welfare  reasons,  the  ducks  were  euthanized  using  intravenous  pentobarbital 

sodium (New Asia Pharmaceutical, China), which was followed by dissection of the liver for

bacterial isolation and PCR detection. 

Isolation and identification of the E. coli 

All liver samples were collected from ducks on a super-clean bench and streaking inoculation 

was performed on MacConkey agar (High-Tech Park HaiBo Company, Qingdao, China) for 

isolation  of  the  E.  coli.  After  being  cultured  for  20 h  at  37 °C,  a  monoclonal  colony  was 

picked  from  the  culture  medium  for  inoculation  of  LB  agar  (HaiBo),  which  was  cultured 

overnight  at  37 °C  for  further  enrichment.  The  bacterial  solution  was  then  used  for  the 

extraction of DNA, with a Rapid DNA extraction kit (Omega, USA) being used according to 

the manufacturer's instructions; this DNA served as the template for PCR identification of the

16S rDNA of the isolates with  the same primers and method used in  the previous literature 

(Hu et al. 2011). Furthermore, isolates identified as E. coli were further culture identified on 

triple  sugar  iron  agar,  and  additional  identifications  were  made  using  glucose,  lactose, 

maltose,  mannitol  and  sucrose  fermentation  tests.  Meanwhile,  the  phylogenetic  group  of 

those  strains  was  determined  according  to  a  published  multiplex PCR  method  (Clermont  et 

al., 2000).

The pathogenicity of those isolates identified as E. coli were further determined by systemic 

animal  experiments.  Specially,  all  isolates  were  used  to  inoculate  LB  agar  (HaiBo)  and 

cultured overnight at 37 °C, and a monoclonal colony from the culture medium was picked to 

inoculate LB agar (HaiBo), which was then cultured for 4 hours at 37 °C. Afterwards, 15% 

glycerite was used to mix all colonies in each plate, and the final concentration of the samples 

was  determined  as  1.0*108  CFU/mL.  Each  sample  was  used  to  inoculate  six  one-week-old 

Cherry Valley ducks by left thoracic air sac with a dose of 1.0*107 CFU for each duckling. 

After  being  inoculated,  all  ducks  were  monitored  daily  for  the  occurrence  of  clinical  signs, 

and  mortality  of  the  ducks  was  recorded  daily.  All  isolates  were  divided  into  three  grades 

based  on  the  follow  criterion:  high  pathogenicity  (3  or  more  ducks  dead),  middle 

pathogenicity (1 or 2 ducks dead) and low pathogenicity (no duck dead,  but  typical  clinical 

symptoms including pericarditis and perihepatitis appeared after inoculation). Meanwhile, the 

main  clinical  signs  and  postmortem  lesions  presented  by  the  affected  ducks  were  recorded.

For the histological examination, samples of the livers, hearts, spleens and kidneys from the 

affected  birds  were  fixed  in  formalin,  embedded  in  paraffin  wax  and  cut  into  sections.  The 

sections  were  stained  with  hematoxylin  and  eosin  and  examined  for  lesions  by  light 

microscopy. 

Biofilm formation detection 

The  biofilm  formation  detection  of  all  APEC  isolates  was  performed  according  to  the 

previous literature (Wang et al., 2011). Specifically, after being cultured in LB agar, 100 μL 

 

of bacterial solution for each isolate was added to a well in a 96-well plate (Corning Costar, 

USA),  with  aseptic  LB  agar  used  as  the  negative  control.  After  being  cultured  for  36 h  at

37 °C, all solutions were discarded, and each well of the plate was washed three times using 

sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS); the plate was then placed in a ventilation closet and 

allowed  to  dry  naturally.  Crystal  violet  (100 μL,  0.1%)  was  then  used  to  stain  the  wells  for 

30 min, and each well of the plate was washed again 3 times using PBS; again, the plate was 

placed in a ventilation closet and allowed to dry naturally. Next, ethanol (200 μL, 95%) was 

added to each well of the plate, and the OD595 was determined on a SpectraMax i3X plate 

reader  (BioTek, USA).  All  isolates were divided into four  grades based on the method in  a 

previous study (Stepanovic et  al.  2000) (OD is  the OD595 of the bacterial  subject,  whereas 

ODc  is  the  OD595  of  the  negative  control)  as  follow:  OD < ODc  (No  biofilm-forming 

ability); ODc < OD < 2ODc (isolate with weak biofilm-forming ability); ODc < OD < 4ODc

(isolate  with  moderate  biofilm-forming  ability);  and  4ODc < OD  (isolate  with  strong 

biofilm-forming ability).

In  this  study,  20  antimicrobial  agents,  including  lincomycin,  clindamycin,  doxycycline, 

polymyxin  B,  cefotaxime,  cefradine,  ofloxacin,  minocycline,  amikacin,  gentamicin, 

neomycin,  tetracycline,  streptomycin,  ciprofloxacin,  florfenicol,  penicillin,  amoxicillin, 

erythromycin,  bacilli  peptide,  and  kanamycin,  were  employed  for  testing  the  drug 

 

susceptibility  of  all  isolates  according  to  the  Performance  Standards  for  Antimicrobial 

Susceptibility Testing (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), Wayne, PA, US). 

Specifically,  all  isolates  were  inoculated  onto  LB  agar  plates  with  the  susceptibility  paper 

disks impregnated with the abovementioned 20 antimicrobial agents affixed on their surface. 

After  being  cultured  for  16 h  at  37 °C,  the  susceptibility  of  the  isolates  was  determined  for 

each drug according to the CLSI standard by measuring and comparing the diameters of the 

inhibition zones, which were then recorded as high susceptibility (HS), medium susceptibility 

(MS), low susceptibility (LS) or resistant (R) for each isolate. 

PCR screening for drug resistance genes and virulence-associated genes   

The  DNA  of  each  E.  coli  isolate  was  prepared  and  extracted  using  the  abovementioned 

methods,  with  PCR  primers  targeting  drug-resistance  genes  and  virulence-associated  genes

being  designed  according  to  published  studies  (Janben  et  al.,  2001;  Ragione  et  al.,  2002; 

Ewers et al., 2005). Detailed information about the primers is shown in Table S1 and Table 

S2. All PCR amplification products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel that was stained with 

ethidium  bromide,  purified  by  the  Gel  Band  Purification  Kit  (Omega,  Bio-Tek,  Norcross, 

GA) and cloned into the PMD18-T vector (TaKaRa, Bio Inc., Japan), followed by sequencing 

in  triplicate  using  an  ABI  3730  Sanger-based  genetic  analyzer  (Applied  Biosystems, 

Carlsbad, CA). The DNA sequences were assembled using DNAStar (version 6.0). Multiple 

sequence alignment was performed using the ClustalW (BioEdit version 7.0) program, and a 

comparison  of  sequence  identity  was  performed  using  MegAlign  software  (DNAStar). 

 

Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the MEGA 5.0 (DNAStar).

At first, viral nucleic acid, including DNA and RNA, was extracted from the liver samples as 

template using a total DNA/RNA isolation kit (Omega, USA), and the RNA was transformed 

into cDNA using a Reverse Transcriptase AMV kit (Takara, Japan) for the subsequent PCR 

assay.  A  triplex  PCR  assay  was  then  employed  to  detect  the  H9  AIV,  NDV  and  TMUV 

according to  a previous  study (Niu  et  al.,  2017).  At the same time, PCR for detecting DPV 

and  FAdV  was  performed  with  primers  designed  according  to  sequences  from  GenBank, 

using the above templates. Detailed information about the primers is shown in Table S3.

Results 

APEC identification and phylogenetic group analysis 

This  study  analyzed  325  duck  farms  from  across  China,  and  APEC  was  isolated  from  26 

farms  by  MacConkey  nutrition  agar  and  chromogenic  media  and  identified  by  16S  rDNA. 

Meanwhile,  all  isolates  were  further  classified  into  two  phylogenetic  groups  according  to  a 

previous study: group B2 (57.69%, 15/26) and group D (42.31%, 11/26). 

Pathogenicity analysis and biofilm-formation ability assays 

Animal experiments using 26 strains of APEC isolates verified 15 highly pathogenic isolates, 

8 intermediately pathogenic isolates and 3 lowly pathogenic isolates. All APEC strains were 

able  to  induce  severe  perihepatitis  (Figure  1a),  pericarditis  (Figure  1b),  splenic  congestion 

(Figure 1c), air sac turbidity (Figure 1d) and renal lesions (Figure 1e) in  the experimentally

infected ducks, whereas no clinical symptoms appeared in uninfected ducks raised under the 

same  conditions  (Figure  1f-j).  Histological  examination  revealed  typical  swelling  and 

necrosis of liver and kidney cells (Figure 2a-b), cardiac particle deformation (Figure 2c), and 

disintegration  of  the  splenic  cells  (Figure  2d)  in  the  affected  ducks.  Meanwhile,  this  study 

also  found  that,  out  of  26  APEC  isolates,  4  isolates  (15.38%)  possessed  strong 

biofilm-forming  ability,  20  isolates  (76.92%)  possessed  moderate  ability,  and  2  isolates 

(7.69%) showed weak ability.

Susceptibility  testing  results  (Figure  3)  demonstrated  that  all  isolates  had  a  high  resistance 

rate  to  antibiotics  that  have  been  clinically  applied  in  the  poultry  industry  for  a  long  time. 

Among  this  resistance,  resistance  rates  to  lincomycin,  clindamycin,  ofloxacin,  penicillin, 

amoxicillin and bacilli peptide were higher than 80%, whereas low resistance was observed 

to doxycycline (15.40%) and amikacin  (0.00%). The resistance rates to the other antibiotics 

(polymyxin  B, cefotaxime, gentamycin,  and neomycin) were less than 50%. Meanwhile, all 

isolates  were  MDR  strains,  whereas  the  resistance  antibiotics  ranged  from  8  to  16  with 

corresponding  proportions  of  3.85%,  15.38%,  19.23%,  15.38%,  15.38%,  11.54%,  11.54%, 

3.85% and 3.85%, respectively.

Detection of drug resistance genes and virulence-associated genes 

Detection results for 11 virulence-associated genes of the 26 strains of APEC isolates showed 

that  the  detection  rates  for  iss,  iucD,  lusS,  tsh,  fimC,  and  pfs  were  higher  than  80%,  which 

demonstrated that all those drug resistance genes generally exist in APEC (Figure 4). On the 

other hand, detection results for the drug resistance genes showed that the detection rates for 

SUL3,  TETa,  GYRa,  GYRb  and  mcr-1  were  higher  than  60%,  whereas  the  detection  rate  of 

FLOR  was  57.69%  (Figure  5).  More  importantly,  a  phylogenetic  analysis  of  those  genes 

showed the detailed proportions and specific genetic relationships among them.

Positive rate of APEC and different viruses   

In  the  study  period,  325  duck  farms  were  chosen  for  detection  of  APEC  and  six  viral 

infectious diseases, as shown in Figure 7. Among the collected samples, the positive rates for 

APEC,  H9  AIV,  TMUV,  DPV,  NDV  and  FAdV  were  8.00%  (26/325),  39.38%  (128/325), 

14.76%  (48/325),  13.53%  (44/325),  11.38%  (37/325)  and  6.15%  (20/325),  respectively 

(Figure 6a). Meanwhile, in those duck farms identified as APEC-positive (n=26), the positive 

rates  of  the  above  viruses  were  84.61%  (22/26),  73.07%  (19/26),  30.76%  (8/26),  7.69% 

(2/26), 11.53% (3/26), respectively (Figure 6b).

Coinfection situation analysis 

The  detection  data  were  also  analyzed  to  show  the  complex  coinfection  situation  in  farms 

with APEC (Figure 7). The results showed that all APEC-positive farms were infected with 

other viruses, synchronously, and the coinfection of APEC with two viruses was common, for 

a rate of 62% (16/26), indicating that such coinfection is widespread. Meanwhile, an infection 

mix with APEC, H9 AIV and TMUV accounted for the greatest proportion, a rate of 42%, of 

coinfection in the field. 

 

Association between epidemics and climates 

To  examine  the  association  between  prevalent  diseases  and  the  seasons,  the  data  were 

analyzed  in  combination  with  cases  occurring  at  different  time  of  these  year,  as  shown  in 

Figure 8. The results demonstrated that the morbidity peak of APEC appeared from May to 

September  (Figure  8a),  whereas  that  of  H9  AIV  appeared  from  approximately  February  to 

September  (Figure  8b)  and  that  of  TMUV  appeared  from  April  to  July,  which  was  slightly 

early than that of APEC (Figure 8c). Furthermore, no obvious morbidity peak was observed 

for the DPV (Figure 8d), whereas the positive rates of NDV and FAdV were too low for an 

examination of the associations between them and the seasons.

Association between epidemics and ages 

As  the  association  between  epidemiological  prevalence  and  age  is  not  well  known,  the 

incidence rates of APEC and the different viral infections occurring in ducks at the different 

life  stages  were  analyzed.  The  results,  shown  in  Figure  9,  suggest  that  infection  can  be 

observed at any stage of duck breeding. However, differences are evident with regard to the 

susceptible stages of particular viral infections. Both the APEC and TMUV had a tendency to 

decrease as the ducks matured. The results suggested that approximately 60% of APEC and 

TMUV infections occurred in ducklings. Meanwhile, the infection status of H9 AIV showed 

reverse results, which suggested that approximately 40% of the H9 AIV infections occurred 

 

in adult ducks. Additionally, the incidence rate of DPV first increased and then decreased.

Discussion 

Because China is a large country of duck production customers, duck breeding accounts for a 

significant part of Chinese agriculture. Nevertheless, with the development of industrial-scale 

production  and  a  significantly  increased  stocking  density,  contagious  diseases  of  duck, 

especially  APEC,  H9  AIV,  TMUV  and  DPV,  have  gradually  become  more  epidemic  and 

severe (Li et al., 2015; Dou et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2017; 

Sun  et  al.,  2013;  Wang  et  al.,  2017).  All  these  infections  induce  a  high  mortality  or  severe 

losses  of  productivity  in  ducks,  whereas  coinfection  among  them  further  aggravates  the 

diseases, making the conditions worse and leading to extensive damage to the duck industry.

More importantly, APEC induced different syndromes in ducks, such as acute colibacillosis, 

respiratory  colisepticemia,  salpingitis,  and  yolk  sac  infection  (Dho-Moulin  and  Fairbrother, 

1999),  which  have  become  increasingly  serious  problems  in  ducks  in  China.  However, 

reports  about  APEC  mostly  have  been  from  chickens  (Wang  et  al.,  2016;  Li  et  al.,  2015), 

whereas  studies  on  the  epidemiological  characteristics  of  it  in  ducks  have  been  rare.  Thus, 

systemic  biological  characteristic  analysis  and  epidemiological  investigation  of  APEC  was 

performed in 325 duck farms from 13 provinces all over the country to  enhance the current 

understanding of the epidemiology of APEC in China.   

In  long-term  practical  applications,  various  antibiotics  have  been  employed  to  prevent  and 

control clinical infections of pathogenic bacteria, but  antibiotic use also  has led to complex 

and  varied  drug  resistance  in  those  germs  that  post  a  huge  threat  to  global  public  health 

(Glass-Kaastra et al., 2014; Mackenzie et al., 2014). As part of this trend, all APEC isolates 

isolated  in  the  present  study  and  subjected  to  drug  resistance  testing  shared  a  high  drug 

resistance  ability,  and  MDR  was  very  common.  This  situation  not  only  increases  the 

difficulty of treating animal diseases like those caused by APEC with existing antimicrobials, 

but it also poses a potential threat to human health in consideration of the cross exchange of 

drug  resistance  genes  between  animal  and  human  pathogens  (Collignon  et  al.,  2015). 

Unfortunately,  consistent  with  previous  studies  (Chen  et  al.,  2014;  Wang  et  al.,  2016),  the 

isolates in this study carried multiple drug resistance genes. Thus, to control APEC in poultry 

is a challenge, especially for the MDR strains, and requires further study.

mechanisms of pathogenicity. Furthermore, biofilms should also be blamed for the increased 

pathogenicity of the APEC, and the adherent microbial communities could induce a persistent 

infection, which is the main reason it is hard to treat bacterial infections using conventional 

antibiotics (Romling and Balsalobre, 2012; Sawhney and Berry, 2009; Zalewska-Piatek et al., 

2009). In this study, most isolates share strong or moderate biofilm-forming abilities, which 

might be another reason for their high pathogenicities, and may lead to an inability to control 

the infection owing to its natural ability to resist antibiotics (Chen et al., 2010). 

On the other hand, pathogenicity analysis showed that most isolates in this study were highly 

or  intermediately  pathogenic,  and  phylogenetic  analysis  suggested  they  belong  to  the  group 

B2  or  D;  B2  is  mainly  responsible  for  primary  APEC  infection,  and  D  is  associated  with 

reinfection and MDR (Ejrnaes et al., 2011). Studies have demonstrated that the pathogenicity 

of APEC is not only determined by the serogroup, but is also determined by other important 

elements such as virulence genes and biofilm formation ability (Dziva and Stevens, 2008). In 

this  study,  all  isolates  carried  multiple  virulence  genes,  and  the  detection  rates  of  iss,  iucD, 

lusS,  tsh,  fimC,  and pfs were  greater than 80%,  which might  play  an important  part in  their 

pathogenicity,  and  detection  of  them  could  provide  the  basis  for  future  studies  on 

More  importantly,  the  positive  rate  of  APEC  for  the  sampled  duck  farms  was  8%,  whereas 

the  rates  of  the  H9  AIV,  TMUV,  DPV,  NDV  and  FAdV  were  39.38%,  14.76%,  13.53%, 

11.38% and 6.15%, respectively. In the APEC-positive duck farms, the positive rates of those 

viruses were 84.61%, 73.07%, 30.76%, 7.69% and 11.53%, respectively, which demonstrated 

that  the  coinfection  with  different  pathogens  was  very  common  in  APEC-positive  duck

farms,  leading  to  more  severe  and  complex  clinical  diseases  (Mosleh  et  al.,  2017). 

Meanwhile,  the  triple-infection  of  APEC/H9  AIV/TMUV  occupied  approximately  42%  of 

those APEC-positive farms,  suggesting this triple infection was the most common infection 

in  the  field.  A  previous  study  indicated  that  E.  coli  and  H9  AIV  together  can  mutually 

exacerbate  the  condition  of  either  disease  compared  to  the  condition  of  birds  infected  with 

one  of  the  two  pathogens,  whereas  E.  coli  infection  prior  to,  after  or  concurrently  with  H9 

AIV virus infection could exacerbate the adverse effects of the virus (Mosleh et al., 2017). In 

consideration  of  the  TMUV,  a  newly  emerged  epidemic  that  has  caused  large  economic 

losses  to  the  aquatic  breeding  industry  of  China,  causing  anorexia,  diarrhea,  weight  loss,  a 

 

drop-in egg production, ovarian hemorrhage and follicle rupture in poultry (Liu et al., 2012), 

the effects of the emerging TMUV infection into the above coinfection of ducks are worthy 

of further study.

study. 

At  the  same  time,  an  association  between  the  climate  and  epidemics  was  also  noted  in  this 

study.  The  results  showed  that  the  morbidity  peaks  of  APEC  and  TMUV  were  very  close, 

whereas the former was slightly earlier than the latter. Such an immunosuppressive pathogen 

could damage the immune system and induce secondary infections; thus, we speculated that 

the  early  infection  of  TMUV  might  be  an  important  reason  for  the  APEC  infections. 

Additionally,  APEC  and  TMUV  shared  a  similar  susceptibility  to  ducklings.  Thus,  detailed 

evaluation of the pathogenicity of the coinfection with APEC and TMUV also needs further

In  conclusion,  this  study  demonstrated  that  the  drug  resistance  and  pathogenicity  of  APEC 

continues to increase, and APEC, H9 AIV, TMUV, DPV, NDV and FAdV were epidemic in 

ducks.  Meanwhile,  the  coinfection  of  APEC  with  viral  infections  was  very  common  in  the 

APEC-positive farms. When two or more viruses, particularly immunosuppressive pathogens 

such  as  AIV  and  TMUV,  simultaneously  or  successively  infect  ducks,  the  pathogens  will 

produce  synergy,  elevating  the  pathogenicity  of  the  APEC  and  resulting  in  more  serious 

clinical signs than monoinfection, which should draw much attention.
