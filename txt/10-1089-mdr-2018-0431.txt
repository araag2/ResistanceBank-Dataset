It is becoming increasingly recognized that the environment plays an important role both in the emergence and
in dissemination of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), Mechanisms and factors facilitating this development
are, however, not yet well understood. The high detection rate of CTX-M genes in environmental sources
provides an opportunity to explore this issue. In this study, 88 CTX-M-producing Escherichia coli were isolated
from 30 pig feces samples from 30 pig farms and 201 environmental samples. CTX-M-producing E. coli was
detected with the following frequencies in the different types of samples: pig feces, 73%; river water, 64%; river
sediment, 52%; wastewater, 31%; drinking water, 23%; outlet sediment, 21%; soil, 17%; and vegetables, 4.4%.
Dissemination of CTX-M-producing E. coli to different environmental matrices was evaluated by analyzing the
genetic relatedness of isolates from different environmental sources, and putative transmission routes through
bird feces, pig feces, drinking water, river sediment, river water, and wastewater were hypothesized. Dis-
semination through these routes is likely facilitated by anthropogenic activities and environmental factors. Wild
birds as potential vectors for dissemination of CTX-M-producing E. coli have the capacity to spread ARB
across long distances. Regional dissemination between different environmental matrices of CTX-M-producing
E. coli increases the exposure risk of humans and animals in the area.

Introduction

A t present, antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) consti-

tute a great threat to human health worldwide. If the
situation is left unchecked, it has been estimated that the
global costs up until 2050 will be 100 trillion USD and an
increase in deaths per year up to a staggering 10 million in
2050.1 To prevent this development, and tackle the global
challenge of antibiotic resistance, a ‘‘One Health’’ per-
spective, which takes into account the connections between
human and animal health and the environment, is required.2

It is becoming increasingly recognized that the environ-
ment functions as a reservoir of ARB and antibiotic resis-
tance genes (ARGs), and plays an important role for the
dissemination and evolution of these environmental con-
taminants. ARGs can be readily transferred to humans
through contaminated environmental matrices, which con-
tribute to the dissemination and persistence of ARB in the
general population.3 For example, environmental exposure
to antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli has been associated
with fecal carriage in humans, including carriage of patho-
genic E. coli, which further indicates the risk to humans

posed by dissemination of ARB between different envi-
ronmental matrices.4

The dissemination mechanisms and risk factors pertaining
to dissemination of ARB and ARGs are not well understood
and need to be further elucidated to enable risk assessment
and design of suitable interventions.5 To date, most studies
focus on ARB and ARGs associated with clinical settings or
animal breeding, whereas the environmental sector is usu-
ally neglected. Furthermore, environmental studies on ARB
and ARGs are usually limited by focusing on a single type
of environmental matrix; studies simultaneously investi-
gating multiple environmental sources are rarely undertak-
en.6,7 Lastly, the detection rates of ARB and ARGs for
resistance to last-resort antibiotics are relatively low, which
increases the difﬁculty of drawing conclusions from the
gathered data. For example, one study reported that the
detection rate of total carbapenem-resistant gram-negative
bacilli from a Swedish river downstream of a wastewater
treatment plant was 4.5% and 2.5% in inﬂuent sewage water
and environmental waters, respectively.8 Other studies have
reported on a prevalence rate of 1.3–3.6% of the plasmid-
mediated colistin resistance gene mcr-1 among isolates of
E. coli from environmental samples.9,10 Therefore,
the
mentioned ARB are not suitable as biomarkers for envi-
ronmental dissemination of ARB and ARGs across different
environmental matrices.

Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are enzymes
that hydrolyze the b-lactam ring of penicillins and third-
generation cephalosporins, such as cefotaxime and ceftazi-
dime.11 Since the 2000s, CTX-M genes have become the
predominant ESBL type.12 Among Enterobacteriaceae,
E. coli is most frequently associated with production of
ESBLs.13 E. coli is a commensal micro-organism and op-
portunistic pathogen of the gastrointestinal tract in humans
and many animals, and is particularly suited to disseminate
ARGs in the environment through the fecal route.14 E. coli is
also the most prevalently isolated Enterobacteriaceae from
environmental sources, and is well adapted for survival
outside of animal hosts.15 CTX-M-producing E. coli
is
widely disseminated and has been reported among various
environmental matrices including river water, well water,
municipal wastewater, soil, and vegetables.16–20 Accord-
ingly, CTX-M-producing E. coli may be a suitable indicator
for studying the mechanisms of environmental dissemina-
tion of antibiotic resistance through fecal pollution.21 In
this study, the prevalence and characteristics of CTX-M-
producing E. coli among various environmental sources in a
rural area of China were investigated to elucidate the dis-
semination of ARB and ARGs among different animal and
environmental matrices.

Materials and Methods

Sampling

The study site is located in a region of rural Shandong
province in eastern China. We chose to conduct the research
in a rural area because household pigs live in proximity to
humans and many residents work as farmers (i.e., they have
extended periods of contact with animals and the environ-
ment). Twelve villages that hold a number of available
backyard pig farms were included in our study. In each
village two to three households with backyard farms (de-

ﬁned as harboring <50 pigs) with at least 1 pig were ran-
domly selected. The pig farms chosen usually did not harbor
other animals aside from pigs. Additional information re-
garding the scale of the pig farming in the sampled villages
is presented in Supplementary Table S1. During July and
September 2015, 30 pig feces samples and 201 environ-
mental samples were collected (Fig. 1) from 12 villages: vil-
lages A (n = 27), B (n = 19), C (n = 15), D (n = 22), E (n = 19),
F (n = 17), G (n = 19), H (n = 21), I (n = 19), J (n = 18), K
(n = 16), and L (n = 19). The environmental samples col-
lected were of wastewater (n = 36), outlet sediment (n = 14),
river water (n = 25), river sediment (n = 25), drinking water
(n = 43), soil (n = 23), vegetables (n = 23), bird feces (n = 6),
and human waste (n = 6). The number of samples and
types of samples are summarized in Table 1. The pig feces
samples were collected from 30 pig farms (a single sample
per farm) and were collected by pooling fresh pig drop-
pings on the ground. Wastewater directly discharged from
the pig farms (i.e., without treatment) were collected by
using sterilized bottles. Samples of bird feces were only
collected from village A; samples were collected twice
daily for 3 days from the ground of a villager’s yard, which
was frequented by swallows. Human waste samples were
collected from public toilets, and since some villages lacked
public toilets, only six samples of human waste from six
villages were collected. Waste samples of animals and hu-
mans were collected using the ESwab collection and
transport system (Copan, Brescia, Italy). Water samples
(from rivers, streams, and wells) were collected by gathering
1 L of water in sterile glass bottles. The sediment samples
were taken by a sediment grabber and the sediment cores
were sliced into 5 cm layers. At least 30 grams of river
sediment and soil samples from vegetable gardens were
collected in sterile plastic bottles. Edible parts of different
vegetables were collected in plastic bags, including beans
(n = 10), cucumbers (n = 6), peppers (n = 3), celery (n = 2),
and leeks (n = 2).

All samples were put in cool boxes with ice packs (4–
8°C) upon collection, and transported to the local CDC
laboratory at the end of the day. Water samples were sub-
jected to ﬁltration through 0.45 mm sterile membrane ﬁlters
(Millipore, Billerica). After ﬁltration, membranes were
transferred into ESwabs and stored at -80°C until cultiva-
tion. Sediments (2.0 g) were homogenized in a ﬁvefold
volume of sterile brain heart infusion broth (Oxoid, Ba-
singstoke, UK). The vegetable samples were not washed,
and the inedible or damaged parts were removed using a
sterilized knife. The surface was sampled using the ESwab
collection and transport system, and stored until analysis as
described hereunder.

Screening of samples for ESBL-producing E. coli

Each sample was inoculated in brain heart infusion broth
(Oxoid) and cultured at 37°C overnight. The enriched so-
lutions were plated on ChromID ESBL agar (bioMe´rieux,
Marcy l’Etoile, France) for 18–24 hours at 37°C to isolate
potential ESBL-producing isolates. Screening was performed
as previously described.22 Species conﬁrmation of pre-
sumptive E. coli isolates was performed by using matrix-
assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-ﬂight mass
spectrometry. ESBL production was conﬁrmed by using the

& Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, 2016), except for
colistin, for which broth microdilution was used. The results
were evaluated in accordance with the European Committee
on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) break-
points version 8.1,a except for tetracycline and nitrofur-
antoin, for which the CLSI breakpoints version 2017 was
used, and ﬂorfenicol, for which the EUCAST epidemio-
logical cutoff value was used. Multidrug resistance was
deﬁned as acquired nonsusceptibility to at least one agent in
three or more antimicrobial categories.25

Molecular typing and determination of putative
transmission routes

For multilocus sequence typing of E. coli isolates, internal
fragments of the seven housekeeping genes (adk, fumC,
gyrB, icd, mdh, purA, and recA) were ampliﬁed by PCR
from DNA, as previously described,26 and subsequently
sequenced (BGI Company). Sequences were imported into
the E. coli Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) database
websiteb to determine sequence types (STs). A phylogenetic
tree based on the concatenated MLST sequences was con-
structed by using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis
5. Annotation of the phylogenetic tree was performed with
Interactive Tree of Life.c

Preparation of DNA for pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis
(PFGE) was performed as previously described.27,28 A den-
drogram with the PFGE results was generated using BioNu-
merics 6.1 (Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium).
According to the Unweighted Pair group Method using
Arithmetic average (UPGMA) cluster analysis, isolates were
deﬁned as being of a related clone if dice similarity indices of
the PFGE ﬁngerprints were >80%. Putative transmission
routes of CTX-M-producing E. coli were determined by
identifying related clones isolated from different sources.

Results

A total of 88 CTX-M-producing E. coli were isolated
from 231 samples (38%); CTX-M-producing E. coli was
detected among all sample types. The detection rate was
highest in pig feces (73%), followed by river water (64%),
river sediment (52%), human waste (50%), wastewater
(31%), drinking water (23%), outlet sediment (21%), soil
(17%), and vegetables (4.4%) (Table 1). In addition, ﬁve
CTX-M-producing E. coli were isolated from three samples
of bird feces (two samples were isolated with four different
CTX-M-producing E. coli).

(n = 9),

(n = 9), blaCTX-M-27

Genes of the CTX-M-9 group were most frequently
detected (n = 64), and blaCTX-M-14 (n = 35) was the predomi-
nant genotype, followed by blaCTX-M-65 (n = 20), blaCTX-M-55
(n = 10), blaCTX-M-15
and
blaCTX-M-3 (n = 5). blaCTX-M-14 was the most common CTX-
M gene found in pig feces as well as some of the environ-
mental sources sampled (human waste, bird feces, river
water, river sediment, and vegetables), whereas blaCTX-M-65
was the most common found in drinking water, soil, and
outlet sediment, and blaCTX-M-55 was the most common
CTX-M gene in E. coli from wastewater samples. The dis-
tribution of CTX-M genes in different matrices and different
villages is shown in Fig. 2. blaCTX-M-14 was found in all
isolates except for those from villages F and L. blaCTX-M-65
was predominant in villages E, F, and J, whereas blaCTX-M-
27 was the main genotype in villages D and L.

All CTX-M-producing E. coli isolates were cefotaxime
resistant, and the majority (>80%) of these isolates were also
resistant to tetracycline, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, and
ﬂorfenicol (Table 2). Fifty percent to 75% of the isolates were
resistant
to fosfomycin, piperacillin–tazobactam, cipro-
ﬂoxacin, gentamicin, and amoxicillin–clavulanic acid; 43%
was resistant to nitrofurantoin, and <25% of the isolates were
resistant to colistin, ceftazidime, cefoxitin, and amikacin.
Only one isolate was resistant to meropenem, whereas none
of the isolates were resistant to tigecycline. All isolates were
multidrug resistant.

A total of 57 STs were detected, including 2 new STs
(Supplementary Fig. S1). The CTX-M-9 producers were
distributed among 43 ST types (n = 64), whereas the CTX-
M-1-producers were distributed among 18 ST types (n = 24).
The most prevalent STs were ST10 (n = 10), ST48 (n = 7),
ST3489 (n = 4), ST34 (n = 3), and ST1638 (n = 3). ST10 was
the most common ST overall, and was found in pig feces,
wastewater, drinking water, river water, and river sediment.
Five isolates from wild birds belonged to ST216, ST542,
ST1011, ST2807, and ST4633. In addition, two isolates
(both belonging to ST2614) from pig waste belonged to
phylogroup B2, whereas three isolates (belonging to ST38,
ST174, and ST2309, respectively) from river sediment,
wastewater, and drinking water, respectively, belonged to
phylogroup D. The predominant STs were distributed over
several villages; ST10 isolates were found in villages D
(n = 4), L (n = 3), H (n = 1), I (n = 1), and J (n = 1); ST48
isolates were found in villages C (n = 3), G (n = 2), F (n = 1),
and H (n = 1); and ST3489-isolates were distributed in vil-
lages B (n = 3) and G (n = 1). Isolates sharing STs were
found in villages A, B, C, D, G, J, and L (Supplementary
Fig. S2).

The PFGE analysis revealed a high clonal diversity among
the isolates, nevertheless, genetically related isolates could
be determined based on the PFGE dendrogram (Supple-
mentary Fig. S3). Twenty-three groups (consisting of two or
more isolates) of related isolates were identiﬁed, with 18 of

be determined.

Discussion

The highest detection rate of CTX-M-producing E. coli
among all sample types was among pig fecal samples
(73%), indicating that pig feces can be a source of wider
dissemination of CTX-M-producing E. coli. A previous
study on CTX-M-producing E. coli
isolated from fecal
samples in 21 pig farms in China reported a prevalence of
43%.29 The detection rate of CTX-M-producing E. coli in
river water in Taian city, China, was 53% in a previous
study.30 Compared with these studies, the prevalence of
CTX-M-producing E. coli in pig feces and river water (64%)
was higher in the study area of this study. In the rural area of
Laiwu, in the Shandong province, China, the prevalence of
CTX-M-producing E. coli in well water has been reported as
23%,31 which was similar to the results in this study. In rural
areas, well water is essential in daily life for activities such
as tooth brushing, bathing, and as drinking water for humans
(usually after boiling) and pigs. Such activities could po-
tentially increase the risk of dissemination of CTX-M-
producing E. coli from the environment to humans and
animals. Notably, CTX-M-producing E. coli was also de-
tected in vegetables (4.4%). The vegetable samples were
collected from edible parts that can be eaten fresh without
preparation, such as cucumbers and pepper. Through
vegetables, humans and animals can be exposed to CTX-M-
producing E. coli in daily life. Three isolates of CTX-M-
producing E. coli (50%) originated from six human waste
samples, and ﬁve isolates of CTX-M-producing E. coli
originated from three samples of bird feces (two samples
were isolated with four different CTX-M-producing E. coli).
Results similar to ours have been reported in a study in
Sweden in which CTX-M-producing E. coli could be iso-
lated from 47% of fecal samples from wild birds.32 Birds
often live close to human settings and are exposed to our
bacteria and antibiotic residues through, for example, garbage
dumps, river, and agricultural areas. Thus, wild birds may be
an important source and facilitator of ARB transmission.

Notably, all of the CTX-M-producing E. coli isolated in
this study (n = 88) displayed the multidrug resistance phe-
notype, with rates of resistance to tetracycline, trimetho-
prim–sulfamethoxazole, and ﬂorfenicol being particularly
high (94%, 82%, and 81% respectively). blaCTX-M genes
may also be selected by environmental exposure to non-b-
lactam antibiotics, either by being physically linked on the
same plasmid as other ARGs or by being carried by ARB
to other antibiotics.33 A previous study in the
resistant
sampling area, conducted during the same period, showed
that the various environmental compartments had levels of
antibiotic contamination that may pose a risk for selection of
ARB and ARGs, further emphasizing the risk of dissemi-
nation of CTX-M-producing E. coli in the local area.34

CTX-M enzymes are the most widely disseminated
ESBLs worldwide, and among clinical isolates, CTX-M-14
is the most common.35–37 CTX-M-65 has been frequently
reported in E. coli isolated from humans and food-producing
animals in China.38,39 In this study, 20 isolates carrying the

blaCTX-M-65 gene were detected in samples from pig feces,
wastewater, soil, drinking water, and river water, implying
that blaCTX-M-65 has been disseminated in pigs as well as in
various environmental matrices inside and outside pig farms.
blaCTX-M-55 is not frequently reported in environmental
isolates from China, nevertheless, the gene was detected in
this study among isolates belonging to six different STs
(ST88, ST206, ST1844, ST2526, ST2973, and ST5020),
showing that blaCTX-M-55 has disseminated among multiple
E. coli lineages in this region.

ST10 has been described from different sources world-
wide, including river water, wastewater, pigs, chicken, and
migratory birds.35,40–42 One study reported on the zoonotic
potential of avian pathogenic isolates of E. coli belonging to
the ST10 clonal complex (includes ST10 and ST48), which
were associated with poultry and human cases of urinary
tract infections and sepsis.43 In this study, one isolate from
wild birds belonged to ST1011. E. coli belonging to ST1011
have previously been reported both as extraintestinal path-
ogenic E. coli isolated from humans and as avian pathogenic
E. coli isolated from birds, suggesting the zoonotic potential
through wild birds of CTX-M-producing E. coli.44 Isolates
belonging to phylogroup B2 (ST2614) and phylogroup D
(ST38, ST174, and ST2309) were also detected in this study.
E. coli of phylogroups B2 and D can possess toxin functions
and are commonly causative agents of urinary tract infec-
tions.45 The presence of E. coli strains capable of causing
urinary tract infections in the environment increases the
exposure risk for humans.

CTX-M genes are a form of environmental pollution re-
sulting from anthropogenic activities, either by direct ex-
posure of the environment to ARGs and ARB through waste
or
through emergence through environmental exposure
to antibiotics of subtherapeutic levels.46 Thus, CTX-M-
producing E. coli is potentially of use as an indicator to
track contamination sources and dissemination of ARB and
ARGs. In this study, genetic relatedness of isolates was
determined by using the PFGE dendrogram (Supplementary
Fig. S2), and putative dissemination routes were explored
based on this phylogeny. The results showed that from all
the sampled villages, isolates could be determined that were
genetically related to isolates from other villages, indicating
dissemination in the local geographical region (Table 3).
Furthermore, 18 groups consisting of genetically related
isolates of CTX-M-producing E. coli from different envi-
ronmental sources were identiﬁed (Table 3). A large number
of isolates with close relatives isolated from different en-
vironmental sources were identiﬁed, suggesting a wide-
spread dissemination of CTX-M-producing E. coli between
environmental matrices in the local area. Pig feces and en-
vironmental sources such as bird feces, drinking water, river
sediment, river water, and wastewater had a particularly
high number of isolates, which could be determined to have
close relatives in other environmental matrices; from all
these sources, isolates genetically related to isolates from
each other of the aforementioned sources were identiﬁed
(excepting that no isolates from bird feces was found that
were closely related to any isolate from drinking water).
These results suggest that these environmental matrices may
serve as nodes through which dissemination of ARGs and
ARB can occur. Although it is likely that transmission can
occur in any direction from any of these environmental

matrices, the methods employed in this study cannot es-
tablish the direction of transmission. Nevertheless,
is
possible to speculate as to the likely routes and mechanisms
of transmission (Supplementary Fig. S4).

it

Anthropogenic activities might modulate the environ-
mental resistance gene pool and promote antibiotic resis-
tance dissemination.46 Pig farms are often ﬂush cleaned with
water, and pig fecal material can be discharged into the
environment through the run-off water from the cleaning.47
In addition, owing to the lack of management measures for
livestock manure, the animal manure was directly piled up
by the river in the study area. During rain, wastewater from
the manure piles can be leached directly into the river, in-
troducing large number of bacteria carrying different types of
ARGs into the river water.48 For example, a high degree of
homology was observed between isolates EC6 (river water,
village A), EC8 (river water, village A), and EC41 (feces,
village C). These results indicated that ARB from animal
feces can spread not only to environmental matrices in the
surrounding aquatic environment in the same village but also
may spread through the aquatic route across villages.

Rivers can likely function as vectors for ARGs and ARB
transmission, either allowing the dissemination along the
river to villages along its length, or to drinking water (well
water) through leaching into groundwater. Previous studies
have shown that environmental factors such as river direc-
tion and aerosols can affect the dissemination of ESBL
genes.49–52 Another study found that presence of CTX-M-
producing E. coli in river water was found to be higher in
regions with large number of animals being raised than in
regions with lower number of animals being raised.53 In this
study, genetically homologous isolates from river water
were also observed in drinking water and wastewater of
different villages, suggesting the possibility of dissemination
through the river to other aquatic environments in the local
area. For example, EC1 (drinking water, village A), EC22
(drinking water, village B), and EC76 (river water, village
H) showed high homology in the PFGE analysis, indicating
that dissemination may have occurred between river water
and drinking water (well water) between different villages.
ARGs and ARB can also disseminate from river water to
soil. For example, CTX-M-producing E. coli isolated from
soil shared high homology with isolates collected from
aquatic environments, which indicates that irrigation may
facilitate dissemination of ARB between different environ-
mental matrices (Supplementary Fig. S5). ARGs may mi-
grate to deeper soil layers and contaminate groundwater
through vertical transport.14 Animal manure is often applied
to soil as fertilizer, thus contaminating the soil with ARB
present in the animal manure.54 However, in this study, no
dissemination of CTX-M-producing E. coli from pig feces
to soil was indicated by the homology analysis. A possible
explanation for this is that the soil and pig manure samples
were collected during autumn, whereas the ﬁelds are gen-
erally fertilized during spring. A failure to observe homol-
ogous isolates in the two sample types could indicate either
that the microbiota of the pigs had changed or that con-
taminating soil through animal manure only gives rise to a
transient presence of the ARB. A previous study investi-
gated ARGs in soils from areas along the Pearl River irri-
gated with wastewater, and concluded that wastewater was
the primary source of antibiotics in the soil.55

Wild birds have been hypothesized to be reservoirs for
ARB, and facilitators of antibiotic resistance dissemina-
tion.35,56 In this study, CTX-M-producing E. coli isolated
from wild bird feces were found to be related to isolates
from animal waste, human waste, aquatic environments, and
the soil, indicating that wild birds may be responsible for
disseminating CTX-M-producing E. coli to these environ-
mental matrices. Furthermore, isolates genetically related to
isolates from wild birds were observed in different villages.
For example, EC18, isolated from bird feces in village A,
was closely related to EC36 (wastewater, village C) and
EC87 (river sediment, village I). Village I is remotely lo-
cated from both villages A and C, and all three villages lack
a connection through river (Fig. 1). A possibility is that
isolates may have spread between villages A, C, and I
through birds;
it had been previously shown that birds
can carry CTX-M-producing E. coli from long distances
while migrating and that an extensive dissemination be-
tween individual birds can allow ARB to persist in dense
bird populations.57 In addition, the isolate EC17 carrying
blaCTX-M-14 gene from wild bird showed a signiﬁcant ge-
netic homology to seven isolates carrying blaCTX-M-14 gene
from different matrices (Supplementary Fig. S3). This indi-
cates that both plasmid and clonal expansion may be impor-
tant modes of dissemination for CTX-M genes in the area.

Conclusion

In this study, CTX-M-producing E. coli were detected in
including drinking
all sampled environmental matrices,
water and vegetables. The prevalence of CTX-M-producing
E. coli was relatively higher in pig feces and river water than
shown in previous studies. Through drinking water and
vegetables from edible parts, humans and animals can be
exposed to CTX-M-producing E. coli in daily life. Positive
samples were distributed over several villages. Dissemina-
tion of CTX-M-producing E. coli to different environmental
matrices was evaluated by analyzing the genetic relatedness
of isolates from different environmental sources, and puta-
tive transmission routes through bird feces, pig feces, drink-
ing water, river sediment, river water, and wastewater were
hypothesized. Dissemination through these routes is likely
facilitated by anthropogenic activities and environmental
factors. Wild birds as potential vectors for dissemination of
CTX-M-producing E. coli have the capacity to spread ARB
across long distances. The PFGE analysis indicated that both
plasmid and clonal expansion may be important modes of
dissemination for CTX-M genes in the area. Regional dis-
semination between different environmental matrices of
CTX-M-producing E. coli increases the exposure risk of
humans and animals in the area.
