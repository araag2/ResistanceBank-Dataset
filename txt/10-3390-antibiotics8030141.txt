Abstract: Goat milk has been frequently implicated in staphylococcal food poisoning. The potential
risk of raw goat milk contaminated by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) in Shaanxi province of China
is still not well documented. This study investigated the prevalence, antibiotic resistance, as well
as virulence-related genes of S. aureus from raw goat milk samples in Shaanxi, China. A total of
68 S. aureus isolates were cultured from 289 raw goat milk. Most of the isolates were resistant to
penicillin and oxacillin, although 41.18%, 33.82%, and 29.41% of the isolates expressed resistance to
piperacillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ciproﬂoxacin, respectively. Our data demonstrated
that 91.18% of the isolates produced bioﬁlm, of which 54.41% isolates belonged to high-bioﬁlm
producers. In addition, genotypic analysis of bioﬁlm related genes (fnbA, clfB, fnbB, cna) revealed that
91.18% of the isolates harbored at least one of the genes, in which the most prevalent genes were fnbA
(66. 17%), clfB (48.53%), and fnbB (26.47%). 94.8% of the isolates contained at least one toxin-related
gene, of which seb (76.47%), tsst (36.76%), and sea (23.53%) genes were the more frequently detected.
Further analysis revealed a positive association between fnbA, clfB, fnbB, seb, tsst, and sea genes and
certain antibiotic resistance. The results indicated that raw goat milk samples contaminated by
S. aureus can be a potential risk to public health.

1. Introduction

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a Gram-positive pathogen that can be isolated from a wide range
of food, animal, human, and medical environments. Recently, microbial food poisoning accounted
for 53.7% of the food poisoning incidents in China, of which S. aureus is one of the most commonly
identiﬁed foodborne pathogens that causes a wide range of clinical infections [1]. S. aureus has been
described to contaminate various foods such as chicken, ﬁsh, dairy products, sushi, and sashimi [2–6],
and thus constitutes a risk for consumer health. In addition, in the dairy industry, S. aureus can be
introduced at almost each step of the production process, and therefore staphylococcal food poisoning
caused by S. aureus has also been highlighted by the dairy industry [7].

S. aureus is a highly versatile bacterium adapting to hostile environments, which was inseparably
associated with its ability to form structures known as bioﬁlms [8,9]. A bioﬁlm is deﬁned as
an assemblage of microbial cells that irreversibly attaches to a surface and enclosed in a matrix
of hydrated extracellular polymeric substances [10]. Bioﬁlm development of S. aureus consists of a
three-stage process of deeply wired genetic developmental process triggered by stress signals, including
(i) attachment of cells to surface, (ii) maturation of the bioﬁlm, and (iii) detachment/dispersal [11,12].
The initial attachment to abiotic or biotic surfaces for bioﬁlm formation involves numerous
surface-anchored proteins such as bioﬁlm-associated protein (bap), collagen-binding proteins (cna),
clumping factors A and B (clfA, clfB), as well as ﬁbronectin-binding proteins A and B (fnbA, fnbB),

which are collectively termed as microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules
(MSCRAMM) [13–16], providing a critical step to establish infections. Accumulation/maturation
of bioﬁlm is mediated by the polysaccharide intercellular adhesin encoded by the icaABCD gene
cluster [13]. S aureus cells growing in a bioﬁlm are physiologically distinct from planktonic cells,
which improve their survival and growth during food processing, thereby establishing a competitive
advantage for S. aureus as an etiological agent of foodborne infectious diseases [15]. Bioﬁlms are very
diﬃcult to eliminate once they have been established. Furthermore, bioﬁlms physically limit access
of antibacterial agents to bacteria. Therefore, bacteria within bioﬁlms are up to 10–1000 times more
resistant to antimicrobials than if they were planktonic cells without bioﬁlms [17].

Staphylococcal food poisoning is directly associated with toxins and invasive enzymes produced
by S. aureus such as staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE), toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1),
and Panton-Valentine leucocidyn (PVL) [18]. Twenty-three types of SEs (Sea-See and Seg-Sev)
have been described [19]. SE is divided into ﬁve classical serological types (Sea, Seb, Sec, Sed and
See), and more than 90% of S. aureus-associated food poisoning outbreaks were associated with these
classic SEs [20]. Additionally, TSST-1 toxin can lead to toxic shock syndrome by reducing host immune
response, and PVL can cause tissue necrosis by destroying host leukocytes [21]. Other SEs (Seg-Seu)
were also detected and have been implicated in staphylococcal food poisoning [22].

Foodborne outbreaks of S. aureus intoxications have been documented to be associated with
consumption of contaminated milk [23,24]. Goat milk is the third largest source of dairy production
in the world, accounting for 2.07% of the total milk. The top goat milk producing countries in the
world are as follows: India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sudan. China is rich in goat milk, in which
Shaanxi province is one of the main sources of goat milk in the Chinese market [25]. With the gradual
popularization of goat milk, raw goat milk might be a potential source of staphylococcal food poisoning
caused by S. aureus. However, only a few studies have been performed on S. aureus prevalence and
contamination levels in raw goat milk in China [26]. Meanwhile, there are a paucity of data regarding
SE gene distribution and bioﬁlm formation ability of S. aureus isolates from raw goat milk samples
in Shaanxi province, China. This study aims to investigate S. aureus contamination in raw goat milk
in Shaanxi province, China. For this purpose, we analyzed the prevalence, contamination levels,
antibiotic susceptibility proﬁles, virulence genes, bioﬁlm formation, and bioﬁlm-related genes of the
S. aureus isolates obtained from Shaanxi province, China.

2. Results

2.1. Isolation and Identiﬁcation of S. aureus

Of the 289 raw milk samples, 68 (23.53%, 68/289) were conﬁrmed to be S. aureus in this study.
S. aureus counts ranged from 2.6 × 102 to 3.3 × 104 CFU/mL, with a mean value of 5.6 × 103 CFU/mL,
in which 25 isolates were lower than 103 CFU/mL and 43 isolates were more than 103 CFU/mL,
suggesting the existence of factors associated with the S. aureus in raw goat milk produced in the region.

2.2. Antibiotic Resistance of S. Aureus Isolated from Raw Goat Milk

The resistance proﬁle of isolates to the tested antimicrobial agents is presented in Table 1.
Resistance to penicillin was the most common (79.41%, 54/68), followed by oxacillin (60.29%, 41/68),
piperacillin (41.18%, 28/68), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (33.82%, 23/68), ciproﬂoxacin (29.41%,
20/68), gentamicin (27.94%, 19/68), clindamycin (20.59%, 14/68), cefazolin (19.12%, 13/68), and linezolid
(14.71%, 10/68). Speciﬁcally, 66 isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic (97.06%, 66/68) and 36
isolates (52.94%, 36/68) were resistant to three or more antibiotics (MDR). All the S. aureus isolates were
susceptible to vancomycin.

2.3. Bioﬁlm Formation and Observation

The results showed 62 isolates (91.18%, 62/68) have the ability to produce bioﬁlms, of which 37
isolates (54.41%, 37/68) were high-bioﬁlm producers, 21 isolates (30.88%, 21/68) of medium-bioﬁlm
producers, 4 isolates (5.88%, 4/68) of low-bioﬁlm producers, and 6 isolates of non-bioﬁlm producers.
For visualization of bioﬁlm formation in S. aureus, bioﬁlms of representative S. aureus isolates were
further investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy
(CLSM) (Figure 1). The bioﬁlm formation ability is presented in Figure 1. Bioﬁlms grown on the
coverslip conglomerated in thick, heterogeneous and multiple layers with columnar clusters were
observed in SA-134, which was high-bioﬁlm producer (Figure 1A,E,I,M). Bioﬁlms clustered into a
honeycomb structure were observed in SA-135, which was medium-bioﬁlm producer (Figure 1B,F,J,N).
By contrast, the SA-136 isolate of low bioﬁlm-producer exhibited lower degree of staining and
showed more dispersed (Figure 1C,G,K,O). Almost all cells of the SA-137 isolate showed a single-cell
distribution, which was non-bioﬁlm producer (Figure 1D,H,L,P).

Adhesion and Biofilm-Related Genes The presence of S. aureus adhesion and biofilm associated genes was detected by PCR (Figure 2, Figure S1–S5). The fnbA gene was observed in 66.18% (45/68) of the isolates, followed by the clfB gene (48.53%, 33/68), the fnbB gene (26.47%, 18/68), the cna gene (13.24%, 9/68), while bap, icaA, and icaD genes were not detected in the isolates. Overall, 59 isolates (86.76%, 59/68) in 68 strains contained at least one adhesion and biofilm-related genes.  Figure 2. The prevalence of adhesion and biofilm-related genes in 68 isolates. 2.5. Virulence-Related Genes The prevalence of virulence-related genes was shown in Figure 3. Of the virulence genes investigated, the three most frequently detected virulence genes were seb (50.00%, 34/68), tsst (36.76%, 25/68), and sea (23.52%, 16/68). The prevalence of the other virulence genes was as follows: seq (14.70%, Antibiotics 2019, 8, 141

In the present study, there were a signiﬁcant association between the presence of fnbA (p < 0.001),
clfB (p < 0.05), along with fnbB (p < 0.05) genes and bioﬁlm formation in S. aureus isolates. Nonetheless
the association between cna gene and bioﬁlm formation were not observed (p > 0.05). In addition,
the fnbA, clfB, fnbB, and cna genes were simultaneously detected in 5 (7.4%, 5/68) isolates, of which
4 isolates were bioﬁlm producers. Five (7.4%, 5/68) tested isolates were negative for fnbA, clfB, fnbB,
and cna, and only one isolates formed bioﬁlms.

Discussion The contamination of dairy products by S. aureus isolates, especially those expressing an MDR phenotype and being capable of producing biofilms and toxins such as enterotoxin, TSST-1, and PVL, poses a serious public health threat to humans. This has been manifested by food-borne poisoning outbreaks resulting from the contamination of S. aureus, including one of the largest staphylococcal food poisoning outbreaks on record involving 13,420 infected individuals in Japan. Similarly, food-borne infections caused by contaminated dairy foods by S. aureus were also frequently described in China [27]. Here, this study investigated the prevalence, the antibiotic resistance phenotype, the ability to form biofilms, along with the presence of biofilm-associated genes and virulence genes of S. aureus isolates from farms in Shaanxi province, China. Acquisition of the prevalence and characteristics of isolates will contribute to prevent the contamination of raw goat milk by S. aureus via effective intervention and protect the end consumer. In this study, 68 out of 385 raw goat milk samples (17.6%, 68/385) were positive with S. aureus. The prevalence of S. aureus is significantly lower than that in the previous report that showed the contamination rate of S. aureus in pork industry was 26% (130/501) in China [28]. Similarly, it was also obviously less than that in other reports which demonstrated that S. aureus was detected in 53.5% (153/286) of the bulk tank milk samples in Italy [29], and 46% (47/104) of the bulk tank milk samples in the United States [30]. In addition, a higher contamination rate of S. aureus was 76.9% (60/78) in bulk tan milk samples in Italy [31]. However, Xing et al. [26] found that the prevalence of S. aureus in raw goat milk of healthy goats in Shaanxi province was 1.5% (1/67) of in final products and 7.5% (60/781) of in goat milk powder processing plant environments in 2012–2013, respectively, which is significantly less than the result obtained here.

3. Discussion

6 of 12

The contamination of dairy products by S. aureus isolates, especially those expressing an MDR
phenotype and being capable of producing bioﬁlms and toxins such as enterotoxin, TSST-1, and PVL,
poses a serious public health threat to humans. This has been manifested by food-borne poisoning
outbreaks resulting from the contamination of S. aureus, including one of the largest staphylococcal food
poisoning outbreaks on record involving 13,420 infected individuals in Japan. Similarly, food-borne
infections caused by contaminated dairy foods by S. aureus were also frequently described in China [27].
Here, this study investigated the prevalence, the antibiotic resistance phenotype, the ability to form
bioﬁlms, along with the presence of bioﬁlm-associated genes and virulence genes of S. aureus isolates
from farms in Shaanxi province, China. Acquisition of the prevalence and characteristics of isolates
will contribute to prevent the contamination of raw goat milk by S. aureus via eﬀective intervention
and protect the end consumer.

In this study, 68 out of 385 raw goat milk samples (17.6%, 68/385) were positive with S. aureus.
The prevalence of S. aureus is signiﬁcantly lower than that in the previous report that showed the
contamination rate of S. aureus in pork industry was 26% (130/501) in China [28]. Similarly, it was
also obviously less than that in other reports which demonstrated that S. aureus was detected in 53.5%
(153/286) of the bulk tank milk samples in Italy [29], and 46% (47/104) of the bulk tank milk samples
in the United States [30]. In addition, a higher contamination rate of S. aureus was 76.9% (60/78) in
bulk tan milk samples in Italy [31]. However, Xing et al. [26] found that the prevalence of S. aureus
in raw goat milk of healthy goats in Shaanxi province was 1.5% (1/67) of in ﬁnal products and 7.5%
(60/781) of in goat milk powder processing plant environments in 2012–2013, respectively, which is
signiﬁcantly less than the result obtained here. This increasing prevalence of S. aureus observed here
might be attributed to the fact that misuse of antibiotics and several other factors has contributed to
the increasing emergence of multidrug-resistant S. aureus. Thus, huge development should allow for
controlling S. aureus contamination in raw goat milk.

The rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance has threatened to render our current antibiotic
therapeutics arsenal useless and poses a great challenge in treatment of serious bacterial infections.
In the current study, the antimicrobial susceptibility test results showed that the 97.06% (66/68) of the
S. aureus isolates from raw goat samples had diﬀerent degrees of resistance to 10 antimicrobials (Table 1).
52.94% (36/68) of isolates were multi-resistant to three or more antimicrobial agents. The results obtained
here were lower than 87% of the isolates from pasteurized milk samples in China [32], 88% of the isolates
from cattle milk, and 87% of the isolates from sheep milk samples in Jordan [33]. Besides, resistance to
penicillin (79.41%), oxacillin (60.29%), and piperacillin (41.18%) were the most frequently observed,
which are the commonly used antibiotics in veterinary drug therapy. In the current study, 79.41% of the
isolates from raw goat milk [34] showed resistance to penicillin G; the penicillin resistance levels were
higher compared to the two previous reports in China (62%), where samples were from large Chinese
dairy herds [35], and in South Africa (71.6%) where S. aureus isolates were derived from animal carcasses
and milk samples from the abattoirs and dairy farms [36]. Resistance to oxacillin were signiﬁcantly
higher than the samples from mastitis-aﬀected cows in India (0%) [37]. In addition, 33.82% of the
isolates studied here showed resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. By contrast, Unal et al. [38]
reported that all isolates from raw goat milk were sensitive to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and
cefoxitin. The relatively high rates of resistance and MDR isolates observed in this study may be due
to the frequent use of penicillin-based antimicrobials in goat farms.

Recently, diverse virulence gene proﬁles were reported from diﬀerent food categories worldwide,
such as ﬁshery products in Galicia. Virulence gene patterns investigated here showed that 79.4% (54/68)
of the isolates were positive with SE genes, which is more than that in the reports of 50% of S. aureus
isolates [39]. Among the enterotoxin SE genes, the most prevalent gene was seb (76.47%), which was
higher than the results from a previous report (11.69%) [40]. Several studies described that none of
isolates from bovine, goat milk and dairy products harbored seb gene [41–43]. Detection rate of sec
gene was 10.3% in our report, which is lower in goat milk by others reported. Maslankova et al. [44]

Antibiotics 2019, 8, 141

also reported that sec gene was the most frequently detected (24.1%) in S. aureus from sheep milk and
dairy products. The diﬀerent prevalence rates observed in SE gene might be explained by fact that
these isolates originated from geographically distinct locations [45]. Of note, the tsst gene (36.76%) was
detected here, which was signiﬁcantly higher than that in the report of 2.2% of S. aureus isolates [39].
Even though most the thermal-treating processes for food processing are strong enough to inactivate
any vegetative S. aureus cells present, but their enterotoxins have displayed their activity even after
these processes [46]. Therefore, more emphasis should be focused on the microbiological examination
of milk and dairy foods.

This study also investigated the formation of bioﬁlms, adhesion genes, and bioﬁlm-related genes
in all isolates studied. In this study, 91.18% (62/68) of S. aureus isolates had ability to form bioﬁlms,
which was in congruence with studies from other countries [47]. Among adhesion genes tested, fnbA
(66.18%), clfB (48.53%), and fnbB (26.47%) genes were observed with a high detection rate. Prevalence
of the fnbA gene were consistent with the results of Zmantar et al. (76.1%) [48]. The fnbA and fnbB are
S. aureus cell surface-bound proteins, bind to both ﬁbronectin and ﬁbrinogen, which enable S. aureus
to attach to host cells of another organism. In addition, clfB gene encoding binding protein that
facilitates S. aureus to establish nasal colonization was also present in 48.53% of the isolates in our study.
The report [49] was higher (93%) than our results. Therefore, our results and other published reports
suggest that fnbA, clfB, and fnbB exhibit an important role in S. aureus bioﬁlm formation. The percentage
of cna gene in this study was 13.24%, which is lower than previous reports by Pereyra et al. and
Klein et al. [50,51]. Ciftci et al. [52] found that diﬀerent frequencies of icaA and icaD have been reported,
but icaA and icaD genes are not detected in our study. Our ﬁndings showed that the prevalence of
adhesion and bioﬁlm-related genes varied widely among isolates.

An interesting ﬁnding of this study was that the presence of fnbA (p < 0.001), clfB (p < 0.05),
and fnbB (p < 0.05) genes showed a signiﬁcant association with bioﬁlm formation. The MSCRAMM
family includes ﬁbronectin binding proteins (fnbA and fnbB), collagen binding protein (cna), and human
ﬁbrinogen binding protein aggregation factors (clfA and clfB). Several other surface molecules
such as teichoic acid may also be important for direct adsorption to the surface of the object [53].
However, they do not play a very important role in the infection of medical devices implanted in the
body. This means that fnbA, fnbB, and clfB genes play a vital role in the formation of bioﬁlms.

In this study, a signiﬁcant correlation was observed between the presence of fnbA gene and
resistance to gentamicin (p < 0.001) and penicillin (p < 0.01). Similarly, there was a positive correlation
between the presence of fnbB gene and resistance to ciproﬂoxacin (p < 0.001) and penicillin (p < 0.001).
The results also showed that the presence of clfB gene was correlated positively with trimethoprim
(p < 0.01), respectively. In addition, the presence of sea gene was signiﬁcantly associated with resistance
to gentamicin (p < 0.001) and oxacillin (p < 0.001), while the presence of seb gene was signiﬁcantly
associated with oxacillin (p < 0.01) and penicillin resistance (p < 0.001). Noteworthy, we found a
signiﬁcant association between the presence of tsst gene and resistance of gentamicin (p < 0.05) and
penicillin (p < 0.001) in S. aureus isolates, respectively. Overall, there is a positive association between
certain antibiotic resistance and bioﬁlm related gene as well as virulence gene in S. aureus isolates.

4. Materials and Methods

4.1. Isolation and Identiﬁcation of Strains

A total of 289 raw goat milk samples were collected from three goat farms during 2016 to 2017
in Shaanxi province, China. Raw milk samples were collected from goats. One milk sample from
each goat was collected. The S. aureus contamination was detected using the most probable number
(MPN) method in raw goat milk samples according to National Food Safety Standards of China
document GB 4789.10-2016. Brieﬂy, 25 ml milk sample was taken and transferred into 225 mL 10%
(w/v) saline solution, and further culture was streaked onto Baird–Parker Agar supplemented with
5% egg yolk and blood agar with sterile deﬁbrinated sheep blood (Land Bridge, Beijing, China),

Antibiotics 2019, 8, 141

respectively, then incubated at 37
C for 48 h, the total number of colonies on each plate was counted.
Finally, all isolates were subjected to the detection of 16S rRNA. All conﬁrmed S. aureus isolates were
stored in tryptic soy broth (TSB) with glycerol at −80
C. No more than two isolates of each sample
were chosen for subsequent studies.

◦

4.2. Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing

The Kirby–Bauer disk diﬀusion method was applied to test the antibiotic susceptibility of all
isolates. Diameter were interpreted by the guidelines of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
[CLSI] (2017). All isolates were assessed for antimicrobial susceptibility to 10 antibiotics (Oxoid,
United Kingdom). The antimicrobial agents included gentamicin (CN, 10 µg), ciproﬂoxacin (CIP, 5 µg),
penicillin (PCN, 10 µg), cefazolin (KZ, 30 µg), clindamycin (DA, 2 µg), vancomycin (VA, 30 µg), oxacillin
(OX, 1 µg), piperacillin (PRL, 110 µg), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT, 25 µg), and linezolid (LZD,
30 µg). S. aureus ATCC 25923 was used as the control strain for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

4.3. Bioﬁlm Formation and Classiﬁcation

◦

The microtiter plate assay for investigating bioﬁlm formation is a means which permits the
observation of bacterial adherence to an abiotic surface. Slightly, after overnight incubation in TSB,
200 µL of cell suspension (approximately 1 × 108 CFU/mL) was diverted into each well and incubated
C for further 24 h. After three washes with PBS (0.01 mol/L, pH 7.4) and a 20-min ﬁxation
at 37
step with 100% methanol, dyed with 0.4% (w/v) crystal violet (CV) for 15 min and washed with
PBS (0.01 mol/L, pH 7.4). Bound crystal violet was then dissolved with 33% acetic acid for 30 min.
The bioﬁlm was measured at 580 nm of OD in a microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Finland).
The bioﬁlm assays were performed in triplicate. According to the critical ODc value, the bioﬁlm is
divided into the following four categories: OD ≤ ODc of non-bioﬁlm producers, ODc < OD ≤ 2 ODc
of low-bioﬁlm producers, 2 ODc < OD ≤ 4 ODc of medium-bioﬁlm producers, and OD > 4 ODc of
high-bioﬁlm producers.

4.4. Scanning Electron Microscope and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy Analysis of Bioﬁlm

For visualization of bioﬁlms, bioﬁlms were further observed by a scanning electron microscope
(SEM, phenom pro, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Netherlands). After overnight growth of S. aureus, 1 mL
of cell suspension (approximately 1 × 108 CFU/mL) was transferred into a 24-well plate containing
coated glass coverslips, cultured at 37
C for another 48 h, and ﬁxed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde-PBS
solution for 2 h at 4
C. The coated glass coverslips were then dehydrated in a series of washes with 30,
50, 70, 90% ethanol for 10 min each, followed by 15 min rinses in 100% ethanol. Air-dried samples
were immediately sputter-coated with platinum and SEM analysis was performed.

◦

◦

Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM, LSM800, Carl Zeiss AG, Germany) was performed
to observe more clearly the bioﬁlm of S. aureus. Bacteria bioﬁlms were prepared using the same
methods as described above. The isolates were removed from the medium and gently rinsed with
0.9% to remove medium and unattached cells. The cells were then stained with carboxyﬂuorescein
diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFDA-SE, Beyotime, China) for 10–15 min. Cells were visualized and
photographed using CLSM. The excitation/emission wavelength was 488/542 nm.

4.5. DNA Extraction and Gene Detection of PCR

◦

Isolates were incubated overnight at 37

C in TSB medium. The genomic DNA was extracted
using the Genomic Extraction Kit (Beijing Trans Gen Biotechnology Co., Ltd.), and the quantity and
quality of DNA was determined by a NanoDrop-2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc,
NH, USA). The adhesion (fnbA, fnbB, clfB, cna), bioﬁlm-associated (bap, icaA, icaD) and virulence-related
genes (sea, seb, sec, sed, see, seg, seh, sei, sej, sek, sel, sem, sen, seo, seq, ser, seu, tsst) were detected by PCR,
respectively. The primers were supplied by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) (Table S1).

4.6. Data Analysis and Statistical Analysis

All experiments were examined independently, statistical analysis was performed using SPSS
Statistics 22 software, graph Pad Prism 5 was used to make graphics. The data were compared using
independent sample test and ANOVA, p < 0.05 indicates that the diﬀerence was statistically signiﬁcant.

5. Conclusions

In summary, our study provides an epidemiological investigation of the prevalence of S. aureus in
raw goat milk in Shaanxi province, China. This study indicates a high prevalence of S. aureus with
virulence genes and bioﬁlm forming ability that might lead to the persistence of S. aureus in goat
farms contributing to serious infections and subsequent food poisoning. To the best of our knowledge,
our results ﬁrstly found a signiﬁcantly positive correlation between bioﬁlm related gene as well as
virulence gene and antibiotics resistance. The results provide potential alternative monitoring measures
by gene detection to eliminate and reduce the contamination of S. aureus in raw goat milk.
