ABSTRACT: To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and prevalence of resistance
genes in Escherichia coli isolated from yaks (Bos grunniens) and herdsmen in nine plateau pastures
in Tibet, we isolated 184 nonidentical strains of E. coli from yaks and herdsmen. Antimicrobial
susceptibility testing of 15 antimicrobials was conducted and the prevalence of sulfonamide
resistance genes (sul1, sul2, and sul3) and florfenicol resistance genes (floR, cfr, cmlA, fexA, pexA,
and estDL136) was determined. Escherichia coli isolated from yaks had a high resistance rate to
sulfamethoxazole (44%), sulphafurazole (40.4%), and florfenicol (11.4%). Escherichia coli isolated
from herdsmen had a high resistance rate to sulfamethoxazole (57%) and sulphafurazole (51%). In
addition, sul genes were present in 93% of sulfonamide-resistant isolates (84/90), and 17 floR genes
and four cmlA genes were found in 19 florfenicol-resistant isolates. Even though florfenicol is
prohibited from use in humans, three floR genes were detected in strains isolated from herdsmen.
The three floR-positive isolates from herdsmen had pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns
similar to isolates from yaks. In addition to documenting the sul and floR genes in E. coli isolated
from yaks and herdsmen in the Tibetan pasture, we demonstrated the potential risk that
antimicrobial-resistant E. coli could spread among herdsmen and yaks.

Key words: Dulfonamides, Escherichia coli, florfenicol, herdsmen, yaks.

INTRODUCTION

Yaks (Bos grunniens) are mammals
adapted to high-altitude and extremely
cold conditions. They provide an impor-
tant source of milk, meat, fiber, and fuel,
making them vital for the production and
material essential for life for herdsmen in
the Tibetan pasture (Gu et al. 2007). The
yak industry was listed as the first batch of
"Promote the Autonomous Prefecture and
Enrich the People" key projects in Seda
County, Ganzi Tibetan autonomous pre-
fecture, Sichuan Province, China.

Although yaks have a strong ability to
resist disease, diarrhea, usually caused by
Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli
remains a major health problem (Ban-
dyopadhyay et al. 2009; Bai et al. 2013).
According to an earlier investigation, the
main antimicrobial agents used in the

treatment of yak for diarrhea were
sulfamethoxazole, sulphafurazole,
florfe-
nicol, penicillin, amoxicillin, and strepto-
mycin (Y.Y. unpubl. data). Although
sulfonamides have been banned from
use in food-producing animals for many
years, sulfamethoxazole and sulphafura-
zole are still used in the Tibetan pasture
because of a shortage of medical services
and supplies. In addition, sulfonamide,
norfloxacin, and amoxicillin are used in
herdsmen for bacterial disease.

Resistance to sulfonamides in E. coli
can result
from the acquisition of an
alternative deoxyhypusine synthase gene
(sul)
(Radstrom and Swedberg 1988),
whose product has a lower affinity for
sulfonamides. Three sulfonamide resis-
tance genes
in
gram-negative bacteria have been de-
scribed (Perreten and Boerlin 2003)

and have been frequently detected in
E. coli
from origins around the world
(Enne et al. 2001; Wu et al. 2010). Flor-
fenicol
is a synthetic, broad-spectrum,
fluorinated derivative of chloramphen-
icol approved exclusively for veterinary
use (Schwarz et al. 2004). Six florfenicol
resistance genes have been detected in
a wide variety of bacteria including floR
and cmlA in several gram-negative bac-
teria (Schwarz et al. 2004): cfr and fexA
in different Staphylococcus spp. (Kehren-
berg and Schwarz 2004) and pexA and
estDL136 in uncultured bacteria (Lang
et al. 2010; Tao et al. 2012).

Little information is available regarding
the epidemiology of antimicrobial-resis-
tant E. coli isolated from yaks and herds-
men in the Tibetan pasture. In this study
we address two questions: 1) What are the
resistance phenotypes and genotypes of
E. coli isolated from yaks and herdsmen?
2) Are drug-resistant bacteria and re-
sistance genes shared by yaks and herds-
men?

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample population

We collected samples from Seda County,
Ganzi Tibetan autonomous prefecture,
Sichuan Province, China, which is on the
southeastern margin of
the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau at an average elevation of 3,893 m.
We collected 300 nonduplicated fecal samples
of yaks (n5210) and herdsmen (n590) from
nine Tibetan pastures between May 2009 and
October 2011 (Table 1). We followed yaks and
collected specimens immediately after fecal
voiding. Fresh fecal samples were placed into
2 mL sterile tubes containing 80% glycerin
and 20% skim milk, stored on ice packs, and
transported to the laboratory for isolation of
E. coli. This study was approved by the local
ethics board of the Medical Ethics Committee
of Sichuan University, and consent was
obtained from all herdsmen in nine Tibetan
pastures.

Bacterial isolates

The samples were inoculated into tryptone
soya broth and incubated at 37 C for 18 h with
shaking at 200 rpm. All of the isolates were
presumptively
identified by phenotypic
including colony morphology on
methods,

MacConkey agar and eosin-methylene blue
agar, and gram stain. Identification was later
confirmed by the Vitek system (bioMe´ rieux,
Durham, North Carolina, USA). The isolates
were stored in Luria-Bertani broth containing
15% glycerol at 280 C until analysis. The ‘O’
serogroup of the E. coli isolates was determined
using a slide agglutination test. The antiserum
used for O serotyping was produced by Tianjin
Biochip Corporation (Tianjin, China).

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

The susceptibilities of the isolates to 15
antimicrobials were determined using the stan-
dard Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method accord-
ing to Clinical and Laboratory Standards In-
stitute guidelines (CLSI 2010) and performance
standards for antimicrobial disk and dilution
susceptibility tests for bacteria isolated from
animals (CLSI 2008). The following antimicro-
bial disks from Oxoid Ltd. (Basingstoke, UK)
were used: ampicillin, amoxicillin, ceftiofur,
gentamicin, neomycin, streptomycin, doxycy-
cline, tetracycline, spectinomycin, nalidixic acid,
norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sulphafurazole, sulfa-
methoxazole, and florfenicol. The internationally
recognized control strain for antimicrobial
susceptibility testing, E. coli ATCC 25922
(American Type Culture Collection, Manassas,

Virginia, USA), was used as the quality control
strain.

PCR for detecting sulfonamide and florfenicol
resistance genes

Escherichia coli isolates, which had resis-
tance to sulfonamide, were amplified (sulfon-
amide-resistant genes sul1, sul2, and sul3) by
PCR using previously described primers
(Kerrn et al. 2002; Zhang et al. 2009). The
rRNA methylase gene cfr;
four florfenicol
exporter genes floR, fexA, cmlA, and pexA;
and the newly discovered florfenicol hydrolytic
enzyme gene estDL136, were amplified in
florfenicol-resistant isolates (Kehrenberg and
Schwarz 2004; Zhang et al. 2009; Lang et al.
2010; Tao et al. 2012). The PCR primers are
described in Table 2. The PCR products were
purified using a QIA quick PCR Purifica-
tion Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, California,
USA), cloned to a pMD18-T vector, and
transformed into JM109-competent recipient
E. coli. Positive clones were sequenced by
Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering
Technology and Services Co., Ltd. (Shanghai,
China) on both strands by automated sequenc-
ing with an ABI Prism 3730 Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California,
USA). The resulting DNA sequence data was

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)

We performed PFGE for 13 floR-positive
isolates from herdsmen and yaks to assess
overlap in the two neighboring pastures
following the criteria of Tenover et al.
(1995). Three florfenicol-resistant
isolates
from herdsmen were included. Electrophore-
sis was performed using a CHEF DRIII
System (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules,
California, USA) after Xba I digestion. The
PFGE conditions were: voltage, 6 V/cm;
included angle, 120u; pulse time, 2.70,29.00
s; electrophoresis time, 20 h; and temperature,
14 C. Software Quantity One version 4.62
(Bio-Rad Laboratories) was used to analyze
genetic relationship among isolates. Similarity
between fingerprints was calculated with the
Dice coefficient (Vali et al. 2014). A cluster
analysis was performed using the unweighted
pair-group method with average linkages.

Statistical analysis

Fisher’s exact test and a x2 tests were used
to compare the susceptibility testing results of
the herdsmen and yak isolates. A P,0.05 value
was considered statistically significant. The
association of E. coli serotypes and antibiotic
resistance was tested by the Pearson’s corre-

lation test using SPSS.19 software (IBM
Corporation, Armonk, New York, USA).

RESULTS

Escherichia coli isolates and ‘O’ serogroup

We isolated 184 nonrepetitive isolates
of E. coli (yaks, n5114; herdsmen, n570)
(Table 1). The isolates from yaks were
divided into 24 ‘O’ serogroups, and the
dominant types included O101 (12.3%),
O2 (9.6%), O68 (7.0%), O132 (7.0%), O78
(5.3%), O171 (5.3%), O22 (4.4%), O142
(4.4%), and O165 (4.4%). The strains
originating from herdsmen were divided
into 12 ‘O’ serogroups, and the dominant
types included O81 (14%), O30 (11%), O5
(11%), O165 (9%), O132 (9%), and O101
(9%).

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

The antimicrobial resistance of these
isolates is shown in Table 3. The strains
isolated from yaks showed the highest re-
sistance rate to sulfamethoxazole (44%),
followed by sulphafurazole (40.4%), florfe-
nicol (11.4%), amoxicillin (8.9%), ampicillin
(6.1%), gentamicin (3.5%), and streptomycin

(1.8%). All isolates were sensitive to neo-
mycin, doxycycline, tetracycline, norfloxacin,
ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, spectinomycin,
and ceftiofur. The resistance ratio of isolates
from herdsmen was 57% and 51% to
sulfamethoxazole and sulphafurazole, fol-
lowed by amoxicillin (26%), ampicillin
(23%), streptomycin (20%), spectinomycin
(14%), tetracycline (11%), ceftiofur (11%),
norfloxacin (9%), doxycycline (6%), florfeni-
col (4%), ciprofloxacin (3%), and neomycin
(0%). Highly significant differences in re-
sistance to streptomycin, spectinomycin,
ampicillin, amoxicillin, ceftiofur, ciprofloxa-
cin, and tetracycline were observed between
isolates from herdsmen and yaks (P,0.001).

Prevalence of resistance genes

Among the 90 sulfonamide-resistant
isolates, sul genes were present in 93%
(84/90), with sul1, sul2, and sul3 detected
alone or in combination in 44 (49%), 45
(50%), and 4 (4%) of
the strains, re-
spectively. No strain was positive for sul2
+ sul3 and sul1 + sul2 + sul3 in
combination. Fourteen (87%) floR genes
were detected in 16 florfenicol-resistant

the florfenicol-resistant

isolates from yaks and three floR genes
were detected in three florfenicol-resistant
isolates from herdsmen. Four cmlA genes
were found in 19 florfenicol-resistant
isolates. In addition, cfr, fexA, pexA, and
estDL136 genes were not detected in any
of
isolates. All
of the positive clones were sequenced.
The basic local alignment search tool
(BLAST) results showed that all of the
sequences obtained in this study were
highly homologous with sequences in
GenBank ($99%). Detailed information
on these resistance genes are provided in
Table 4.

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and
genetic relatedness analysis of strains

Six different Xba I-PFGE patterns
(I,VI) of floR-positive isolates were ob-
served. Some isolates had similar patterns.
In pattern I, WY8 isolated from yaks was
similar to WH4 and WH7 isolated from
herdsmen in Wuqin pasture (similarity
coefficient 0.83). There was a similarity
coefficient of 0.86 between WY12 isolated
from yaks in Wuqin pasture and GY13
from yaks in Gaoshan pasture, which had
similar PFGE patterns to GH12 isolated
from herdsman in Gaoshan pasture
(Fig. 1). No significant association was
found between serotypes and resistance
phenotypes.

DISCUSSION

We found 24 ‘O’ serogroups in E. coli
isolates from yaks, which was significantly
different from E. coli isolated from captive
yaks in India (Bandyopadhyay et al. 2009).
Only three serogroups (O2, O22, and
O78) reported in this study were also
observed in Shiga toxin-producing E. coli
in yaks in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
(Bai et al. 2013). This implies that diverse
‘O’ serogroups of E. coli were present in
yaks in different regions. Both O101 and
O132 were simultaneously present in yaks
and herdsmen, suggesting overlap of ‘O’

in our

Escherichia coli

study had
a higher resistance to sulfanilamide than
to other antimicrobial agents but much
lower than the strains isolated from other
commercial animals in China (Lei et al.
2010; Tian et al. 2012). The reason for this
low rate of antibiotic resistance might be
the short-term use of antibiotics in Tibet-
an pastures. The antibiotic-resistant phe-
notypes of isolates from herdsmen were
more complicated than isolates from
yaks (Table 3). According to the survey
of antibiotic use in Tibetan pastures
(Table 1), sulfanilamides (sulphafurazole
and sulfamethoxazole) were mostly used
to treat yaks with diarrhea. However,
herdsmen usually used sulphafurazole,
sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, and amoxi-
cillin for their own illness. Our results
were in accordance with the custom of

using these antimicrobial agents in pas-
tures. Although florfenicol
is prohibited
for use in humans, florfenicol resistance
was detected in three isolates from herd-
smen. This
that antibiotic
resistant isolates or genes might be trans-
mitted from yaks to herdsmen.

indicates

We mainly amplified the sulfonamide
resistance genes in E. coli due to the high
resistance to sulfanilamide. The florfenicol
resistance gene was also included because
of the florfenicol-resistant E. coli found in
herdsmen. Among 90 sulfanilamide-resis-
tant strains, the positive rate of sul genes
the sul
was 93%, which revealed that
genes were most prevalent in the Tibetan
pasture. A nearly perfect correlation
between genotype and phenotype was
found with regard to sulfanilamide. The
sul1 and sul2 genes were common in
sulfanilamide-resistant
results
which differ from other research on swine

strains,

(Blickwede

and chickens (Kozak et al. 2009). Seven-
teen florfenicol resistance genes (floR)
were found in 19 florfenicol-resistant
E. coli, indicating that efflux of the drug
is the main resistance mechanism to
florfenicol
and Schwarz
2004). The cfr, fexA, pexA, and estDL136
genes were not amplified in any of the
florfenicol-resistant isolates in our study.
A possible reason is that the cfr and fexA
genes were mainly found in gram-positive
bacteria, whereas only one cfr gene-
positive strain has been found in E. coli
(Wang et al. 2012). The pexA and
estDL136 genes were only detected in
uncultured bacteria from soil (Lang et al.
2010; Tao et al. 2012). However, to the
best of our knowledge, this is the first
report of the floR gene in E. coli isolated
from yaks and herdsmen.

A few strains of E. coli isolated from yaks
and herdsmen in different pastures had the
same serogroups, antimicrobial-resistant
gene, and PFGE patterns, suggesting that
the potential risk of antimicrobial-resistant
E. coli would disseminate in yaks and
herdsmen through the spread of clones.
This result might be caused by lifestyle and
poor sanitary conditions in Tibetan pas-
tures. The Tibetan people have a close
relationship with yaks through drinking
yak milk, eating air-dried yak meat, and
burning yak droppings for energy. This
could imply that, although the drug is used
strictly in animals, the use of florfenicol
might select for and amplify resistance to
antimicrobials that are relevant to human
health (O’Brien 2002). Previous research
has shown that antimicrobial-resistant bac-
teria could spread from animals to humans
(Winokur et al. 2001; Rwego et al. 2008),
which was proven by our research. Con-
tinuous surveillance of antibiotic resistance
should be performed in Tibetan pastures.
In conclusion, we report the floR gene
in E. coli isolated from yaks and herdsmen
and a high presence of sulfonamide re-
sistance genes in E. coli isolated from the
Tibetan pastures. We also demonstrated
that the antibiotic-resistant E. coli and

resistance genes (such as floR) might
directly disseminate between humans
and yaks due to the lifestyle habits
(burning yak droppings for energy,
