Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have been found in various farm
animal species throughout the world. Yet, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA),
methicillin-susceptible non-S. aureus (MS-NSA), and methicillin-resistant non-S. aureus
(MR-NSA) were not investigated. Therefore, we persued to determine the diversity
in their phenotypic virulence assay, phenotypic antimicrobial resistance proﬁle and
molecular characterization in one of the food chains in Egypt. Samples were collected
during 2013 from beef meat at retail. Twenty seven isolates comprising ﬁve species
(S. hyicus, S. aureus, S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans, S. intermedius, and S. lentus) were
characterized for their antibiotic resistance phenotypic proﬁle and antibiotic resistance
genes (mecA, cfr, gyrA, gyrB, and grlA). Out of the 27 Staphylococcus isolates only
one isolate was resistant to the 12 antibiotics representing nine classes. Raw beef meat
sold across the Great Cairo zone, contains 66.7% of MRS, with highest prevalence was
reported in S. aureus (66.7%), while the MRS non-S. aureus strains constituted 66.7%
from which S. hyicus (60%), S.
intermedius (33.3%), S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans
(100%), and S. lentus (100%) were MRS. Seven S. aureus, six S. hyicus, four S. schleiferi
subsp. coagulans, three S. intermedius, and one S. lentus isolates although being
resistant to oxacillin yet, 11/27 (40.7%) carried the mecA gene. At the same time, the cfr
gene was present in 2 of the nine S. aureus isolates, and totally undetectable in S. hyicus,
S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans, S. intermedius, and S. lentus. Although, global researches
largely focused into MRSA and MR-NSA in animals on pigs, the analysis of our results
stipulates, that buffaloes and cattle could be MRSA dispersers and that this theme is
not speciﬁc to pigs. Detection of MSSA virulence determinants is a must, as although
oxacillin resistance may be absent yet, the MSSA may carry the virulence determinants
which could be a source of perilous S. aureus for the human community.

Meat MSSA, MRSA, MS-NSA, MR-NSA

INTRODUCTION

In Egypt,
since more than three millennia dating from
the Eighteenth Dynasty chronology, the domestic cattle are
incorporated with all types of agricultural activities in addition to
their provision of meat, internal organs (heart, kidneys, pancreas,
rumen, intestine), milk, cheese, ghee, skin, bone, manure, horns,
and tendons (Conférence publique de Mlle M-Christine Lavier
Toulon, 2000; Benderitter, 2003).

Antimicrobial agents are widely spread and intensively
(FAO, 2015). The
used in the food production systems
aftermath of this operation varies considerably globally as a
result of the interaction between human (social structure) and
animal demography (species, distribution, and density), farming
systems, contaminated water sources, socio-economic strategies
(manufacturing, commerce, availability of food, and animal
ﬁtness), and nation and world-wide trade. Although, antibiotic
use in food animals has been concealed from the public scene yet,
antibiotic application in meat producing animals have impacted
on public health and has left no room for confusion after
being scientiﬁcally documented (Conniﬀ, 2015). In 2010, an
announcement having a public consequential impact was made
public by the FDA to the world in that 28.7 million pounds
of antibiotics, which comprises 80% of the total amount of
antibiotics utilized in the USA, were being poured down in
the animal production industry not to medical care and that
currently, two million people are annually sickened by resistant
bacterial infections and that 23,000 die annually according to the
CDC (Conniﬀ, 2015).

Eventually, besides tracing the use of antibiotics, the eﬀectual
monitoring of antimicrobial resistance is the linchpin of any
national and international successful achievement
in their
control policy. The pivotal role of monitoring was highlighted in
the 2001 WHO Global Strategy for Containment of antimicrobial
resistance and on the occasion of World Health Day 2011,
wherein resistance, antimicrobial consumption, and disease
stress are included as prime listings. The facts and statistics
collected can be used to implement the government’s rationale for
introducing such radical legislation in the perfection of antibiotic
use, to propose strategy and discern the prime concern for
employment to provide public support regionally and globally.

Staphylococcus aureus is a hazard because of its detrimental
eﬀects on animal health and its capacity for transmission from
animals to humans and vice-versa (Peton and Le Loir, 2014).
The isolation universality of multidrug-resistant staphylococci
from meat samples has been perceived by several researchers
(Santos-Sanches et al., 2000; Khan et al., 2005; Huber et al.,
2011; Bhargava and Zhang, 2014; Chaj˛ecka-Wierzchowska
et al., 2015; Guran and Kahya, 2015). This should be taken
seriously, especially when the ﬁnding of Waters et al. (2011)
documents that, close to 50 percent of meat samples tested
from U.S. grocery stores are contaminated with the bacteria
S. aureus and resistant to at least three classes of antibiotics.
Methicillin-resistant strains of S.
aureus (MRSA), which is
linked to a wide range of human diseases (Köck et al., 2010;
Fätkenheuer and Kaasch, 2014; Yaw et al., 2014), is notorious
for its related-Nous to food contamination and its potentiality

for its transmission to humans prevails. The pre-eminent
disquiet in the European Union, has become the prevention
and control of MRSA being ascertained as the most public
health problem (Köck et al., 2010), an act that should be
implemented in Egypt. Also, the high prevalence of MR-CNS
found in livestock production (Huber et al., 2011) becomes a
relevant consternation in view of the dispersing potentiality of
mecA to MRSA as several coagulase negative staphylococcus
(CNS) species, which are also non-S. aureus (NSA), can
serve as reservoirs for mecA (Bhargava and Zhang, 2014).
This consigned multiresistant CNS-NSA strains the intuitive
capability to develop into an emerging problem for veterinary
medicine.

Although CNS have emerged as important pathogens, little is
known about the virulence factors of these bacteria (Stepanovic
et al., 2001). The most important virulence factor of CNS is
assumed to be the capacity for bioﬁlm formation and, that
testing for bioﬁlm production could be a useful marker for the
pathogenicity of CNS (Stepanovic et al., 2001).

In general, we have not come across any investigations
involving bioﬁlm formation, and the antibiotic resistant genes
mecA, cfr, gyrA, gyrB, and grlA in MRSA in beef meat and
in methicillin-resistant non-S. aureus (MR-NSA). Thereby, we
aimed an endeavor to identify one of the main hazardous
threat to public health, Staphylococcus species, to determine the
generality of contamination of beef meat as a measurement for
the exposure of consumers to MRSA and MR-NSA in retail
beef meat in the Egyptian market, the rate of bioﬁlm producers
among the tested S.
aureus comparable to non-S. aureus
strains, their carriage to the antibiotic resistant genes mecA, cfr,
gyrA, gyrB, and grlA and their consequence as a public health
hazard.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample Collection
During the year 2013, 100 samples of retail whole beef were
collected from several butchers and marts in the Great Cairo
zone. Each sample weighing at least 500 g was aseptically
collected with the minimum of cross-contamination and
immediately conveyed to the laboratory to be microbiologically
examined.

Isolation and Identiﬁcation
To 50 g of meat samples, 100 ml of phosphate-buﬀered saline
was added all in a sterile plastic bag which were vigorously
shaken for 2 min to remove bacteria. Then 1 ml of each rinsate
was used for isolation and detection of Staphylococcus isolates
by the Double Enrichment method. The isolates were used for
further culture to be consequently biochemically characterized
as S. aureus (n = nine) and non-S. aureus (n = 18) according
to Thorberg and Brandstrom (2000). A sub-culture of the 27
isolates were stored at −27◦C in tryptic soy broth and fetal
calf serum [Gibco/Invitrogen Carlsbad (CA) USA] containing
2% yeast extract (v/v) to be revitalized for phenotypic virulence
assay, phenotypic antimicrobial resistance proﬁle and molecular
characterization.

Phenotypic Virulence Assays
For the 27 isolated staphylococci, four virulence factors were
evaluated (alpha, beta and delta hemolysins, cytotoxicity, and
bioﬁlm formation) using phenotypic tests.

production as non-slime-producing strains develop red colonies.
ATCC 35982, a non-slime-producing strain (−), ATCC 35983,
a moderate slime producing strain (++), and ATCC 35984, a
strong slime producing strain (++), served as controls.

Hemolysis Pattern on Blood Agar
The 27 tested isolates were subcultured onto 5% deﬁbrinated
sheep and rabbit blood (Merck, Darmstad, Germany) at 37◦C for
24 h according to the procedure of Futagawa-Saito et al. (2006) to
obtain isolated colonies. The type of hemolysis was recorded as
α-, β-, and double (α + β). After incubation at 37◦C for 24 h the
clear zone around the colonies was registered as positive reaction.
Some S. aureus strains proved the presence of CAMP-like factor,
a special hemolysin, the activity of which is revealed by streaking
the bacterial studied strain on 5% sheep blood agar, at 8 mm
distance perpendicularly on the β-hemolytic S. aureus ATCC
25923 reference strain, and incubating the plate aerobically at
37◦C for 24 h. The occurrence of synergic β-haemolysis at the
conﬂuence of the two spot areas indicates the presence of CAMP-
like factor. The S. aureus (ATCC 25923 and ATCC 49775) and
S. intermedius Hajek (ATCC strain 49052) were used as reference
strains.

Cytotoxicity Assay
The cytotoxicity assay was carried out using Vero (African green
monkey kidney) cells in 96-well microtiter trays according to
the protocol of Tao et al. (1999). Suspensions of each of the
27 staphylococcal strains in distilled water were adjusted to 0.5
McFarland standard. Then, 20 µl of bacterial suspensions were
added to 3.5 ml of brain heart infusion broth (BBL, Becton
Dickinson Microbiology Systems). The tubes were incubated 2
days at 35◦C, and thereafter for 2 days at room temperature. After
centrifugation of bacterial broth cultures, 20 µl of supernatants
were added in triplicate to 180 µl of cell culture medium. After
incubation at 37◦C,
in a humid atmosphere and 5% CO2,
the cytotoxic eﬀect of each staphylococcal strain on the Vero
monolayer morphology was microscopically perceived up to 5
days.

Bioﬁlm Formation
Bioﬁlm formation assay was determined by the Christensen’s
tube method and the Congo red agar assay (CRA) as proposed
by Osman et al. (2015, 2016). The bioﬁlm-producer ATCC 25923
and the bioﬁlm negative ATCC 12228 were used as reference
strains.

Phenotypic Characterization of Slime
Production in CRA
This method is based on the characteristic cultural morphology
of bioﬁlm-forming bacteria on Congo red medium. The strains
were cultured on CRA plates, composed of brain heart infusion
broth (BHI) (Oxoid Ltd, Hampshire, England) 37 g/l, 10 g/l
Congo red and 50 g/l sucrose and agar No 1 (Oxoid Ltd,
Hampshire, England) 10 g/l. The plates were subsequently
incubated for 24 h at 37◦C and overnight at room temperature.
The production of black colonies with a dry crystalline
consistency by the organisms was taken to indicate slime

Investigation of Bioﬁlm Production by
Adherence to Borosilicate Test Tubes
A qualitative assessment of bioﬁlm formation was determined
by tube assay. An overnight culture of each of the 27 isolated
staphylococci were grown in MHB and incubated for 24 h at
37◦C. The tubes were removed and washed with phosphate buﬀer
saline and dried. Tubes were stained with 0.1% crystal violet for
10 min. Excess stain was removed and tubes were washed with
distilled water. Tubes were then dried and observed for bioﬁlm
formation. Bioﬁlm formation was considered positive when a
visible ﬁlm lined the wall and bottom of the tube. Ring formation
at the liquid-air interface was not indicative of bioﬁlm formation.
The scoring for tube method was done according to the results
of the control strains. The isolates were classiﬁed into three
categories: Bioﬁlm formation was considered positive when a
visible ﬁlm lined the wall and the bottom of the tube. The amount
of bioﬁlm formed was scored as 1-weak/none, 2-moderate, and
3-high/strong.

the 27 isolated staphylococci

Phenotypic Antibiotic Resistance Proﬁle
Resistance of
to 12 speciﬁc
antibiotics (Table 3) were validated by culturing each isolate
on Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) supplemented with 0.5% NaCl
and 2% for oxacillin, to obtain a fresh culture, to be determined
by the disk diﬀusion method according to procedures of
the CLSI
(2012). Antimicrobials on the WHO’s critically
important antimicrobials list (2012) were selected for testing
according to their importance to human and animal health
(FAO/WHO/OIE, 2008; WHO, 2009). One loopful of colony
material was subcultured in 5 ml Mueller-Hinton broth for
an overnight at 35◦C, vortexed well and adjusted to obtain
a turbidity comparable to that of 0.5 McFarland opacity
standard (bioMe’rieux, Marcy 1’Etoile, France). The bacterial
suspensions were streaked on MHA plates with a cotton swab
and with an antibiotic disc dispenser, the discs were placed on
the agar surface, plates were incubated at 37
C, the standard
temperature used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, for
24 h, and the diameter of the inhibition zones was measured.
The isolates were classiﬁed as sensitive,
intermediate and
resistant based on the diameter of the clearing zone according
to CLSI (2012) guidelines. The antibiotic discs represented
nine classes of antibiotics: ampicillin-sulbactam, methicillin,
penicillin,
chloramphenicol
ciproﬂoxacin (Florinated quinolones);
(Chloramphenicols);
clindamycin (Lincosamides); gentamycin (Aminoglycosides);
erythromycine (Macrolides); sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim
(Sulphonamides);
(Tetracyclines); vancomycine
(Glycopeptides). S. aureus ATCC 29213 (β-lactamase positive),
and S. aureus ATCC 25923 (β-lactamase negative) were used
as quality control. Multidrug resistance was reported as a
single isolate resistant (intermediate or complete) to 3 or more
antimicrobial classes (Waters et al., 2011). Bacteria strains

also ampliﬁed. Annealing temperatures and oligonucleotides
used are presented in Table 1. The PCR runs included a
reagent positive and negative control (without template DNA).
Three independent PCR ampliﬁcations were carried out with
a GeneAmp PCR System 2400 (Perkin-Elmer, Weiterstadt,
Germany). Two microliters of template DNA was added to
23 mL of distilled sterile water, and ﬁnally 25 mL of reaction

streptogramin compounds,

mixture containing 10mM Tris-HCl (pH8.3), 50mM KCl, 2.5mM
MgCl2, 100 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 1 mM of each

were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel in
TBE buﬀer.

RESULTS

We identiﬁed 27 staphylococcal
diﬀerent staphylococcal species. These included S. hyicus (n =
10, 37%), S. aureus (n = 9, 33.3%), S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans
(n = 4, 14.8%), S. intermedius (n = 3, 11.1%), and S.
lentus
(n = 1, 3.7%).

Phenotypic Virulence Assays
Summarized results of examining the 27 staphylococci isolates for
factors that possibly contribute to their virulence are presented in
Table 2.

Haemolysin Production
Haemolytic activity on plates with 5% deﬁbrinated rabbit or
sheep blood was established. In the strains showing hemolytic
activity, the three patterns of haemolysis (β, α, and γ) were
observed, 66.7% were demonstrated to be β-hemolytic, 22.2%
were α-hemolytic, and 10.1% were γ-hemolytic.

Cytotoxicity Assay
All of the 27 Staphylococcus isolates were cytotoxic to Vero cells.

bioﬁlm producer (77.8%). Generally, the 20 vancomycin resistant
S. aureus and non-S. aureus species were also bioﬁlm producers.
The aﬃnity of the 27 Staphylococcus species to form a bioﬁlm was
found to be in favor of the glass surface by 88.9% (24/27).

Tube Method
The qualitative tube adherence test depends on the visual
assessment of the degree of adherence of Staphylococcus isolates
to the sides of borosilicate test tubes. The 27 Staphylococcus
isolates were screened for bioﬁlm formation by tube method.
Results of the screening for bioﬁlm by the tube method is shown
in Table 2. Out of the 27 Staphylococcus isolates, 24 (88.9%)
were strongly positive to the ability of bioﬁlm formation, while
3 (11.1%) were negative to bioﬁlm formation. Bioﬁlm formation
aﬃnity was observed in the nine S. aureus isolates (100%) and
15/18 in the non-S. aureus isolates (83.3%).

Congo Red Agar Method
Among the 27 Staphylococcus isolates, 11 (40.7 %) showed black
colonies with dry crystalline consistency which is indicative of
slime production whereas 16 (59.3 %) isolates showed pink
colored colonies with mucoid appearance on the CRA plates
which were taken as negative for slime production (Table 2).
Ability to produce slime was evident in 4/9 (44.4%) of the
S. aureus and 7/18 (38.9%) of the non-S. aureus isolates. The
studies on slime formation by the non-S. aureus species of
medical importance revealed that S. hyicus, S. schleiferi subsp.
Coagulans, and S. intermedius showed that up to 30% (3/10),
75% (3/4) and 33.3% (1/3), respectively, of these species produced
slime, while S. lentus (1/1) was unable to produce slime.

Antibiotic Resistance Phenotypes for All
Staphylococci
The phenotypic resistance pattern, prevalence and diversity of
the 27 Staphylococcus species isolated from the beef meat are

recorded in Table 3. The 27 Staphylococcus species were resistant
to the 12 antibiotics with variable degrees as to each of the
antibiotics used as indicated in Table 3 to reveal in ascending
order: ampicillin-sulbactam 14.8% (4/27), chloramphenicol
29.6% (8/27), erythromycin 48.1% (13/27), ciproﬂoxacin 59.3%
(16/27), methicillin 63% (17/27), tetracycline 66.7% (18/27),
vancomycine 74.1% (20/27), oxacillin 77.8% (21/27), penicillin
92.6% (25/27), clindamycin 96.3% (26/27), gentamycin 96.3%
(26/27), and sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim 100% (27/27).
The diﬀerent Staphylococcus species also reﬂect a diﬀerence
in their antibiotic resistance to the 12 antibiotics each species
with a diﬀerent capacity to resistance: S. lentus 91.7% (11/12),
S. aureus 77.8% (84/108), S.
intermedius 72.2% (26/36),
S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans 70.8% (34/48), and S. hyicus 55%
(66/120).

The several MDR combination patterns are recorded in
Table 4. The Table reveals,
there were 21 diﬀerent
combination patterns ranging from four to twelve antibiotics
in each combination. Out of the 27 Staphylococcus isolates only
one isolate was resistant to the 12 antibiotics representing nine
classes. This isolate was one of the nine S. aureus isolates
(Table 5). The Table also reveals the wide dispersity in the
number of antibiotic combinations in each isolate and species
isolates (S. aureus, ﬁve combinations;
of
S. hyicus, ﬁve combinations; S. intermedius, three combinations;
S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans two combinations; and S. lentus, one
combination).

The PCR ampliﬁcation results are summarized in Table 5. All
except for one staphylococcal isolate (S. lentus) beared > two
antibiotic resistant genes and a noticeable number of these
staphylococci (17/27, 63.7%) carried four diﬀerent antibiotic
resistant genes. In particular, the nine S. aureus isolates carried
the ﬁve antibiotic resistant genes that confer resistance to
the 12 diﬀerent antibiotics tested in this investigation. Seven
S. aureus, six S. hyicus, four S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans, three
S. intermedius and one S. lentus isolates although being resistant
to oxacillin yet, 11/27 (40.7%) carried the mecA gene. The
association between the mecA gene and oxacillin resistance is
outlined in Table 5. At the same time, the cfr gene was present
in 2 of the nine S. aureus isolates, and totally undetectable
in S. hyicus, S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans, S. intermedius and
S. lentus. At the same time, the cfr gene was present in two of

Detailed Analysis of Selected Isolates:
Species Determination
The 27 isolates were chosen for further detailed examination
on the basis of their ciproﬂoxacin and oxacillin from the disc
diﬀusion screening. There was interspecies and intraspecies
variation among the non-S. aureus species listed in Table 3.
The four ciproﬂoxacin-susceptible, oxacillin -susceptible isolates
examined, were S. hyicus. Again, four ciproﬂoxacin-resistant,
oxacillin susceptible isolates were S. hyicus. Of
the four
ciproﬂoxacin-resistant, oxacillin -resistant isolates, four were
S. hyicus, two were S. intermedius and one was S. schleiferi
subsp. coagulans and S. lentus each. The study shows that, the

occurrence of MRS from beef meat is not uncommon (Table 6).
Raw beef meat sold across the Great Cairo zone, contains 66.7%
of MRS (18/27), with highest prevalence was reported in S. aureus
(6/9, 66.7%), while the MRS non-S. aureus strains 12/18 (66.7%)
from which S. hyicus (6/10, 60%), S. intermedius (1/3, 33.3%), S.
schleiferi subsp. coagulans (4/4, 100%), and S. lentus (1/1, 100%)
were MRS.

Survey of Methicillin, Oxacillin, and
Ciproﬂoxacin Resistance
As seen in Table 3, the distribution of oxacillin among the
non-S. aureus (CNS) isolates was quite broad (14/18, 77.8%).
The overall frequency of ciproﬂoxacin resistance among non-
S. aureus (CNS) was 44.4% (8/18), while that among methicillin-
resistant non-S. aureus (MRCNS) was 61.1% (11/18), higher,
as expected, than that for methicillin-susceptible non-S. aureus
(MSCNS) 33.3% (6/18). The distribution of S. aureus and
non-S.
aureus ciproﬂoxacin susceptibilities as a function of
methicillin susceptibilities in addition to the mecA resistance
determinant which is responsible for the methicillin resistance,
is recorded in Table 6.

DISCUSSION

The non-S. aureus species that have been isolated in the present
investigation were recorded as relevant in their ability to produce
human infections (S. lentus, Stepanovic et al., 2003; S. hyicus,
Casanova et al., 2011; S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans, Davis et al.,
2013; and S. intermedius, Koci et al., 2015).

Humans are at a risk of being infected with resistant food-
borne bacteria via the food chain (Khan et al., 2000; Pesavento
et al., 2007) from reservoir animals (de Jong et al., 2009; Ewers
et al., 2009; O’Keefe et al., 2010; Marshall and Levy, 2011). A
previous research (Waters et al., 2011) has suggested that, when
buying meat at any butcher shop, supermarket or local grocery
shop, is an equally likely chance of it being contaminated with
drug-resistant bacteria. The WHO has revealed a report on the
global serious threat of antibiotic resistant strains of bacterial
pathogens occurring currently in every locality of the world with
no limitations and to aﬀect everybody, at any age and in any
country (CDC, 2013).

In animals, comparison of resistance rates to antimicrobials
can geographically vary among internationally and nationally
according to the antimicrobial usage regime (Harada and Asai,

2010; Doyle et al., 2013) due to sample collection schemes,
sample types, their minimum capability to implement AMR
surveillance, rock-bottom ﬁnancial and technical resources and
diﬀerences in the implemented methodologies in the form of
credibility, duplicability, enequitable signiﬁcance, price, duration
and simplicity (Strommenger et al., 2006; Cookson et al., 2007;
Faria et al., 2008; Vindel et al., 2009; David et al., 2013) which
makes any comparative eﬀort to be unadvisable.

A wide dispersion of two categories of resistance has been
revealed in the present investigation: 100% of our isolates carried
the QRDRs responsible for quinolone resistance genes (gyrA and
grlA) (17/27, 63% and 19/27, 70.4%) and the mecA resistance
determinant (11/27, 40.7%), responsible for the methicillin and
oxacillin resistance (Table 5). The mecA determinant has caused

severe complications during the treatment MRSA in humans
(Lee, 2003) and for S. epidermidis infections too (Kitao, 2003)
when the hypothesis that, mecA is transferred from non-S. aureus
staphylococci to S. aureus (Grundmann et al., 2006; Bhargava and
Zhang, 2014) is taken into consideration.

The French National Monitoring Program (RESABO)
established evidence that S. aureus is more susceptible to
antimicrobial drugs than non-S. aureus species (Werckenthin
et al., 2001). Conversely, our results had a commensurate
regular and sequence discernible in the antibiotic resistance
genes between S. aureus and non-S. aureus
isolates. The
results showed a congruity between phenotypic resistance and
molecular genotyping for oxacillin, QRDRs, and PhLOPSA
phenotypes. Generally, our results are in assonance with

in the treatment of staphylococcal infections (Witte and Cuny,
2011).

Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are antibiotics eﬀective against a wide
range of organisms (Oliphant and Green, 2002) and having
a role in the chemotherapy and postexposure prophylaxis for
organisms, that could be used in biologic warfare. The extensive
use of FQs has led to the springing up of FQ-resistant S. aureus,
especially among MRSA strains (Oliphant and Green, 2002) in
the QRDRs of the gyrA, gyrB, grlA, and grlB genes (Hooper, 2002;
Oliphant and Green, 2002; Redgrave et al., 2014; Parkinson et al.,
2015). Gade and Qazi (2013) signiﬁed that, ciproﬂoxacin can no
longer be used as an empirical therapy against MRSA infections
to be replaced by vancomycin as the alternative drug to which we
are in dispute as we recorded a 77.8% resistance in the MRSA. It
should be noted that, the access to any available literature on any
information concerning the gyrA, gyrB, grlA, and grlB genes in
meat was not available.

Chaj˛ecka-Wierzchowska et al. (2015) who displayed that, all
methicillin resistant staphylococci harbored mecA gene but in
consonance with the investigation outcomes of Martineau et al.
(2000), Lee et al. (2004), and Guran and Kahya (2015), who
indicated the occurrence of staphylococci strains resistant to
methicillin or/and oxacillin in the absence of the mecA gene. The
reason behind this variable expression could be related to the
hyperproduction of β-lactamase type A (Martineau et al., 2000)
and/or cellular growth conditions according to Lee et al. (2004).
Globally, there are considerable discrepancies between diﬀerent
countries in the MRSA prevalence rate on beef meat (Normanno
et al., 2007; van Loo et al., 2007a,b; Chan et al., 2008; Pu et al.,
2009; Lim et al., 2010; Weese, 2010; Weese et al., 2010; Bhargava
et al., 2011; Chua et al., 2011; Hanson et al., 2011; Dalhoﬀ, 2012;
O’Brien et al., 2012; Buyukcangaz et al., 2013; Jackson et al., 2013;
Nnachi et al., 2014; WHO, 2014).

The animals are the ﬁrst reservoirs for CNS bearing the
cfr resistance gene which endows resistance to phenicols,
lincosamides, oxazolidinones, pleuromutilins, and streptogramin
A antibiotics (PhLOPSA of phenotype) and some macrolides
(Kehrenberg et al., 2005). An interesting and fortunate
observation was that, we detected the gene cfr in 22.2% (2/9) of
the S. aureus isolates, a rate which was lower than the detection
rates of food animal samples in previous studies (Wang et al.,
2012; Zeng et al., 2014) while the non-S. aureus isolates did not
carry this gene. The cfr multiresistance gene is usually found in
isolates of human origin (Chen et al., 2013; Cui et al., 2013) and
persistence in retail meat (LaMarre et al., 2011). The insigniﬁcant
detection rate found in this study (2/27, 7.4%), indicated the
neglible opportunity of the cfr to be spread through contaminated
meat with Staphylococci in the local market by consumers in
Egypt, the diminished possibility of this gene to enter the food
cycle, and the chance of additional distribution of cfr from an
animal reservoir to S. aureus, MRSA or any other staphylococcal
species associated with colonization and infection in humans
(Witte and Cuny, 2011) is abolished. Timely detection and
targeted prevention of further dissemination of MRSA present
on retail beef meat and the cfr gene becomes justiﬁed in order to
preserve eﬃcacy of linezolid due to its importance and preference

The contamination of carcasses with MRSA can occur via
several means: (i) improper agricultural practices, (ii) use of
impotable water for agricultural
irrigation, (iii) the use of
improperly disinfected appliancies used in the food industry,
(iv) unsuitable temperatures during storage and transportation,
(v) poor food handling procedures, vi) lack of rodent and/or
insect control (FDA, 2012; WHO, 2012), (vii) through the
butchers tools which are suitable vehicles for transmission
(de Boer et al., 2009), (viii) on the meat display table, to
buyers and vice versa (Emele et al., 1995). The environmental
contamination of the slaughter-house, processing appliances
or operative hands in these facilities with MRSA could result
in a cross-contagion process to the meat (Wertheim et al.,
2004; Alexandra et al., 2011), and consequently conceal the
importance of
the association between on-farm antibiotic
use and contamination of the meat with MRSA. The most
important outcome of our investigation was the alarming ﬁnding
that, most of the MRSA and NSA-MR isolated from retail
meat in the Egyptian market were >50% resistant to clinically
important
(sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim,
clindamycin, gentamycin, peniciilin, oxacillin, vancomycin,
and erythromycin

in descending order)
to public
health of the Egyptians. In addition, the prevalence rate of
the MRSA and NSA-MR isolated from retail meat collected
from sale outlets reﬂected an indication to the level of
exposure of
the consumers to these pathogens (Wagenaar
et al., 2007).

CONCLUSIONS

To the best of our knowledge, the extent of a similar research
topic has not been tackled in Egypt. In addition, the strength of
our study lies in the fact that, previous researches on S. aureus
isolated from foodstuﬀs were merely screened for the mecA gene,
while in our investigation a selective enrichment of MRSA was
adopted to be followed by a PCR technique for the identiﬁcation
for the presence of mecA gene. Also, we included in our
investigation samples collected from three diﬀerent geographic

areas involving both municipal and agricultural sectors. In some
of our strains, we found that although resistance was recorded,
yet the responsible gene was not expressed which could be due
to, the small number of resistance genes tested or/and the gene
responsible for resistance was not included in our protocol. There
are no existing programs for surveillance which allows us to
recommend a large scale of research to be conducted to cover
the whole country with speciﬁc zone system, specifying large
number of sample size to be included covering most type of meat
consumed in Egypt.
