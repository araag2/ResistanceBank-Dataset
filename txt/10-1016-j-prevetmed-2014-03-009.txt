Non-typhoidal   salmonellosis   is  of   concern   in   humans   in   sub-Saharan   Africa,   and   this   is
partly  due  to   the   high   number   of   immunocompromised   persons.   Pork   and   pork   prod-
ucts   could   be  among   the   sources   of  these   non-typhi   Salmonella   spp.  The   aim   of  this   study
was   to  identify   Salmonella   spp.   in   piglets   and   weaners   in   northern   and   eastern   Uganda,
characterize   their   antimicrobial   resistance   patterns   and   determine   herd-level   risk   factors.
Fecal  samples   were   collected   from   465   piglets   and   weaners   from   93   herds   (49   and   44
from   northern   and   eastern   Uganda,   respectively).   In  addition,   information   about   the   herd
management   and   potential   risk   factors   were   collected.   The   fecal   samples   were   cultured
for  the   identiﬁcation   of   Salmonella   spp.   The   Salmonella   spp.   conﬁrmed   by   serotyping   were
further  characterized   by   determination   of  minimum   inhibitory   concentration   (MIC)   to   12
antimicrobials   by   broth   microdilution.   At   individual   level,   the   total   prevalence   of  Salmonella
spp.   was  12%  (12.2%   in   northern   and   11.9%   in   eastern   Uganda).   At  herd   level,   the  total
prevalence   was   39%  (43%   in   northern   and  34%  in   eastern   Uganda).   From   56   samples   with
Salmonella   spp.,   20   serovars   were   identiﬁed   including   two   serovars   identiﬁed   only   by   their
antigenic  formulae.   The   predominant   serovars   were   S.  Zanzibar,   S.  Heidelberg,   S.   Infantis,   S.
Typhimurium,   S.   Stanleyville,   S.   Aberdeen   and   S.   Kampala.   In  total,   57%   of   the   53   Salmonella
spp.   analyzed,   originating   from   27%  of   the   herds,   were   resistant   to  at   least   one   antimi-
crobial   agent.   The   majority   of  drug-resistant   isolates   (60%)   were   from   northern   Uganda.
Eight  multidrug-resistant   (MDR)   isolates   were   from   northern   Uganda   and   three   MDR   iso-
lates  were   from   eastern   Uganda.   Increased   prevalence   of   Salmonella   spp.  was   associated
with  feeding   the  young   and   adults   separately   as   compared   to  feeding   the   young   and   adults
together  (p  =  0.043,   OR   =  4.3;   95%   CI  1.1,   17.38).   Protective   factors   were   “intensive”   method
of   keeping   the   pigs   versus   “tethering   and   roaming”   (p  =   0.016,   OR   =   0.11;   95%  CI  0.02,   0.64),
“intensive”   method   versus   “semi-intensive”   method   (p   =  0.048,   OR   =   0.12;   95%   CI  0.01,   0.96)

0.72).   This   study   has   revealed   a  high   prevalence   of   infection   of   piglets   and   weaners   with
diverse   non-typhi   Salmonella   serovars   and   highlights   the   potential   role   of   pork   and   pork
products   as   sources   of  these   organisms   for   humans.   In  addition,   this   study   has   identiﬁed
protective   factors   that   could   be   promoted   to  control   Salmonella   spp.   and   in   antimicrobial
resistance   reduction   programs   in   rural   pigs   from   Uganda.

is
their 
Baggesen,
1996;  Bonalli  et  al.,  2012).  All  non-typhi  Salmonella
spp.  (over  2500  serovars)  are  considered  as  human
pathogens  (WHO,  2005).  Non-typhoidal  salmonellosis
(NTS)  is  one  of  the  most  common  food-borne  zoonoses  in
the  world  (Gomez  et  al.,  1997).  The  NTS  is  more  common
among  children,  the  elderly  and  the  immunocompromised
persons  (Shaw  et  al.,  2008).  In  Uganda,  with  the  advent
of  the  Human  Immune  Deﬁciency  Virus  (HIV)  infections,
many  people  are  now  highly  susceptible  to  clinical  and
life-threatening  NTS  with  increased  prevalence  in  persons
with  very  low  CD4+ cell  counts  (Gilks,  1998).

In  pigs,  clinical  salmonellosis  is  considered  uncommon
(Kranker  et  al.,  2003)  and  only  a  few  serovars  namely
Salmonella  enterica  subspecies  enterica  serovar  Cholera-
suis  (S.  Cholerasuis),  S.  Typhimurium,  S.  Enteritidis  and  S.
Derby  have  been  implicated  in  clinical  disease  (Fedorka-
Cray  et  al.,  2000).  In  piglets  and  growing  pigs,  Salmonella
infections  may   cause  enterocolitis,  septicemia  and  death.
However,  subclinical  infections  are  common  (Lo  Fo  Wong
et  al.,  2002;  Aragaw  et  al.,  2007;  Vigo  et  al.,  2009)  and  there-
fore,  pork  and  pork  products  are  considered  to  be  among
the  major  sources  of  NTS  for  humans  world  over  (EFSA,
2008).

Invasive  NTS  in  humans  is  treated  by  the  use  of  antimi-
crobials.  In  Uganda,  the  most  commonly  used  drugs  are
chloramphenicol,  ciproﬂoxacin  and  nalidixic  acid  (Kalule
et  al.,  2012).  Lately,  cases  of  drug-resistant  non-typhi
Salmonella  spp.  have  been  reported 
in  a  number  of
countries  in  Africa  (Kariuki  et  al.,  2006).  With  increasing
and  rampant  use  and  misuse  of  antibiotics  in  developing
countries  (Sirinavin  and  Dowell,  2004;  Byarugaba,  2004),
this  situation  is  bound  to  worsen.  One  of  the  possible  ways
to  ameliorate  this  situation  is  to  prevent  contamination
of  pork  and  pork  products  through  control  of  Salmonella
infections  right  from  the  farm  level  to  fork  by  identify-
ing  possible  risk  factors.  However,  no  studies  have  been
done  to  identify  possible  risk  factors  for  Salmonella  infec-
tions  in  Ugandan  village  pigs,  which  may   be  targeted  in
a  control  program  to  reduce  the  prevalence  of  infection
and  antimicrobial  resistance.  The  aim  of  this  study  was
to  (1)  determine  the  prevalence  and  identify  serovars  of
Salmonella  spp.  in  piglets  and  weaners  from  two   districts
in  northern  and  eastern  Uganda,  (2)  determine  the  preva-
lence  of  Salmonella  spp.  at  herd  level  from  two  districts
in  northern  and  eastern  Uganda,  (3)  characterize  antimi-
crobial  resistance  of  the  isolated  Salmonella  spp.  and  (4)

2.  Materials  and  methods

2.1.  Study  area  and  design

This  study  was  carried  out  during  2011  and  2012  in
Gulu  and  Soroti  districts,  located  in  northern  and  east-
ern  Uganda,  respectively.  The  location  of  Gulu  district  is
between  longitude  30◦21(cid:4) east  to  longitude  32◦ east  and
latitude  2◦ north  to  latitude  4◦ north.  The  location  of
Soroti  district  is  between  longitude  30◦01(cid:4) east  and  lon-
gitude  34◦18(cid:4) east  and  latitude  1◦33(cid:4) north  and  latitude
2◦23(cid:4) north.  These  two  districts  were  purposively  selected
because  of  their  large  pig  populations  as  compared  with  the
neighboring  districts.  The  study  households  selected  were
keeping  pigs  including  piglets  and/or  recently  weaned  pigs,
i.e.  at  most  2  weeks  after  weaning.  Data  were  collected  from
6  sub-counties  and  Gulu  municipality  in  Gulu  district,  and  4
sub-counties  and  Soroti  municipality  in  Soroti  district.  The
study  involved  collection  of  fecal  samples  for  bacteriologi-
cal  analysis  and  administration  of  a  questionnaire  to  collect
data  on  the  pig  management  practices  and  health  to  iden-
tify  potential  risk  factors.  The  questionnaire  also  captured
information  on  the  demographics  of  the  household  heads.

2.2.  Identiﬁcation  of  households  and  administration  of
the  questionnaire

There  was   a  lack  of  information  on  the  households  keep-
ing  pigs  with  piglets  or  weaners  and  therefore,  households
were  identiﬁed  by  the  snowballing  method  to  redundancy
(Kagira  et  al.,  2010;  Pondja  et  al.,  2010).  Brieﬂy,  the  ﬁrst
household  was  identiﬁed  with  the  help  of  the  district
animal  husbandry  ofﬁcers  and  the  local  area  council  chair-
persons.  The  research  team  visited  the  ﬁrst  household
to  ﬁll  in  the  questionnaire  that  contained  questions  on
the  demographics  of  the  household  head  and  pig  owner-
ship,  management,  health  and  marketing.  With  the  help
of  the  previous  pig  farmers,  the  subsequent  households
were  then  identiﬁed  and  questionnaires  were  ﬁlled  in.
With  permission  from  the  household  heads,  the  question-
naires  were  ﬁlled  in  by  personal  interviews  to  household
members  who   commonly  took  care  of  the  pigs.  The  ques-
tionnaire  was   written  in  English  and  the  questions  and
answers  were  at  each  visit  communicated  between  the
research  team  and  the  persons  from  the  local  communi-
ties  in  the  local  languages.  The  local  languages  used  in  this
study  were  Luo  in  northern  Uganda  and  Ateso  and  Kumam

in  eastern  Uganda.  Before  data  collection,  the  question-
naire  was  pretested  by  selected  veterinary  ofﬁcials  and  pig
farmers  in  the  study  area  and  thereafter  reviewed  by  the
research  team.

2.3.  Deﬁnition  of  methods  of  management

In  this  study,  a  pig  herd  was  considered  “roaming”  when
the  pigs  of  all  ages  were  let  loose  and  allowed  to  move  freely
from  place  to  place.  The  pigs  were  considered  “tethered”
when  the  adults  and  weaners  were  tied  with  ropes  to  pegs
but  the  piglets  were  let  loose.  The  pigs  were  considered
to  be  under  an  “intensive”  system  of  management  when
they  were  housed  and  therefore,  prevented  from  escap-
ing  to  the  outside.  Lastly,  the  pigs  were  considered  to  be
under  “semi-intensive”  system  when  they  were  housed,
but  also  allowed  to  move  within  an  enclosed  space  without
a  roof.  However,  during  the  administration  of  the  question-
naire,  it  was  found  that  the  two  categories,  “tethering”  and
“roaming”  were  not  possible  to  conclusively  separate  and
therefore,  these  two  were  merged  into  one  category  called
“tethering  and  roaming”  in  the  analysis.

2.4.  Collection  of  fecal  samples

Fecal  samples  were  collected  from  all  piglets  or  wean-
ers  when  the  litter  size  at  the  time  of  sampling  was   1–5
piglets  or  weaners.  If  the  litter  size  exceeded  5  piglets
or  weaners,  fecal  samples  were  collected  from  5  piglets
or  weaners  per  sow  selected  at  random.  In  a  litter  with
diarrhea  and  having  more  than  5  piglets  or  weaners,  fecal
samples  were  collected  from  all  diarrheic  piglets  or  wean-
ers  and  from  5  non-diarrheic  piglets  or  weaners  selected
at  random.  Therefore,  each  sampled  pig  was  scored  as
being  diarrheic  or  not.  Individual  fecal  samples  were  col-
lected  from  the  rectum  using  sterile  swabs  (Heinz  Herenz,
Hamburg,  Germany)  and  immediately  placed  into  5  mL   of
sterile  and  chilled  Stuart  transport  medium  (Oxoid,  Bas-
ingstoke,  England)  in  bijour  bottles.  The  fecal  samples  were
then  transported  on  ice  in  a  cool  box  to  the  laboratory  at
the  College  of  Veterinary  Medicine,  Animal  Resources  and
Biosecurity,  Makerere  University,  within  24  h  of  sampling
for  bacteriological  culture  and  isolation.

2.5.  Bacteriological  culture,  isolation  and  conﬁrmation

The  bacteriological  cultivation  was  performed  in  accor-
dance  with  standard  procedures  (ISO,  2002).  Brieﬂy,
each  fecal  swab  was  separately  cultured  in  9  mL   of  pre-
enrichment  medium  (2%  w/v  buffered  peptone  water,
Mast  group  Ltd,  Merseyside,  UK)  at  37 ◦C  for  18  h.  There-
after,  0.1  mL   of  the  turbid  pre-enrichment  medium  was
transferred  to  9.9  mL   of  Rapparport  Vassiliadis  (RV)  enrich-
ment  broth  (Oxoid,  Basingstoke,  England)  for  enrichment
at  42 ◦C  for  24  h.  Subsequently  0.1  mL   of  the  turbid  RV
broth  were  inoculated  onto  Xylose  Lysine  Desoxycholate
(XLD)  agar  (Mast  group  Ltd,  Merseyside,  UK)  and  incu-
bated  at  37 ◦C  for  24  h.  Three  black  colonies/isolates  with
a  red  periphery  typical  for  Salmonella  spp.  were  sub-
cultured  and  biotyped  using  triple  sugar  iron  agar  (Mast
group  Ltd,  Merseyside,  UK)  for  sugar  fermentation  and  H2S

production,  tryptophan  broth  (Sigma,  USA)  for  indole  pro-
duction  and  urea  agar  (Mast  group  Ltd,  Merseyside,  UK)  for
urease  production.  Suspected  Salmonella  colonies  (glucose
fermenter,  non-lactose  fermenter,  H2S  producer,  indole
and  urease  negative)  were  further  biotyped  using  API®
20E  kit  (Biomerieux,  France)  following  the  manufacturer’s
instructions.  The  Salmonella  spp.  biochemically  conﬁrmed
were  then  serotyped  (one 
isolate  per  sample)  at  the
Swedish  Salmonella  Reference  Laboratory,  National  Vet-
erinary  Institute  (NVI)  according  to  the  Kauffmann–White
scheme  (Grimont  and  Weill,  2007).

A  pig  herd  was  considered  Salmonella-positive  when  at
least  one  fecal  sample  from  the  litter  (s)  tested  positive  for
Salmonella  spp.

2.6.  Analysis  for  antimicrobial  susceptibility

The  Salmonella 

isolates  serotyped  were  tested 

for
antimicrobial  susceptibility.  This  was  done  by  determi-
nation  of  minimum 
inhibitory  concentration  (MIC)  of
12  antimicrobials  (ampicillin,  ciproﬂoxacin,  nalidixic  acid,
gentamicin,  tetracycline,  sulfamethoxazole,  trimethoprim,
chloramphenicol,  kanamycin,  streptomycin,  cefotaxime
and  ceftazidime)  by  broth  microdilution  according  to  the
protocol  from  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards  Institute
(CLSI,  2008)  using  VetMICTM GN-mo  (version  4)  test  kits
(NVI,  Sweden).  The  MIC   analysis  was   performed  at  Mak-
erere  University  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  from
the  manufacturer  (NVI).  Escherichia  coli  ATCC® 25922TM
(USA)  was  used  as  quality  control  strain.  The  results  were
interpreted  following  the  guidelines  provided  by  CLSI
(2012)  and  NARMS  (2010).

2.7.  Data  analysis  for  risk  factors

Data  from  the  questionnaires  and  bacteriological  analy-
sis  were  ﬁrst  coded  and  entered  into  SPSS  version  17  (SPSS
Inc.,  Chicago,  USA).  The  data  were  checked  for  any  errors
that  may   have  occurred  during  entry.  Errors  were  corrected
by  re-checking  against  the  original  questionnaires  and  lab-
oratory  result  sheets.  The  data  were  imported  into  the  SAS
program  9.3  (SAS  Institute,  USA),  described  using  summary
statistics  and  analyzed  using  Chi-square,  Fisher’s  exact  test
and  logistic  regression.

In  the  statistical  analyses,  the  status  of  the  herd  was
the  dependent  variable.  All  independent  variables  were
cross-tabulated  against  the  herd-level  outcome  (Salmonella
spp.  isolated  or  not)  at  univariable  analysis  using  Chi-
square  or  Fisher’s  exact  test  when  the  requirements  for
Chi-square  test  were  not  met.  All  variables  with  a  p-value  of
≥5  counts  in
≤0.25  from  univariable  analyses  and  having 
each  cell  were  offered  as  candidate  variables  to  the  mul-
tivariable  analysis  for  model  ﬁtting.  Collinearity  among
variables  was  evaluated  by  cross-tabulation  of  candidate
variables  using  Fisher’s  exact  test.  Two  variables  were  con-
≤0.05
sidered  collinear  when  cross-tabulated,  a  p-value  of 
was  obtained.  Selection  among  the  collinear  variables  for
multivariable  analysis  was   based  on  biological  plausibil-
ity.  Logistic  regression  was   performed  using  SAS  GLIMMIX
procedure.  From  the  selected  variables,  three  models
were  ﬁtted  to  the  data  using  the  logit  function  and  the

42 

K.  Ikwap  et  al.  /  Preventive  Veterinary  Medicine  115  (2014)  39–47

parameters  estimated  by  maximum  likelihood.  The  ﬁtness
of  the  models  was  assessed  using  Akaike  Information  Cri-
terion  (AIC)  and  the  ratio  of  Pearson  Chi-square  (deviance)
to  the  degrees  of  freedom  (DF).  Only  the  best  ﬁtted  model
was  reported  and  taken  to  be  signiﬁcant  if  the  p-value  was
≤0.05.

3.  Results

3.1.  Number  of  samples  collected  and  prevalence  of
Salmonella  infection

A  total  of  93  households  were  visited  (49  from  Gulu  and
44  from  Soroti  districts),  and  overall,  465  fecal  samples  (271
and  194  from  Gulu  and  Soroti  districts,  respectively)  were
collected  and  analyzed.  Overall,  the  number  of  samples  col-
lected  per  household  ranged  from  1  to  12  with  a  mode  and
average  of  5  and  varied  depending  on  the  size  of  the  litter,
number  of  the  litters  and  diarrhea  in  the  litter.  Of  the  465
samples,  32  were  from  diarrheic  piglets  and  weaners.

At  individual  pig  level,  the  prevalence  of  Salmonella  spp.
was  12.2%  (n  =  271)  in  Gulu  and  11.9%  (n  =  194)  in  Soroti
with  a  total  prevalence  of  12%  (n  =  465).  At  the  herd  level,
the  prevalence  of  Salmonella  spp.  was  43%  (n  =  49)  in  Gulu
and  34%  (n  =  44)  in  Soroti  with  a  total  herd  prevalence  of
39%  (n  =  93).  Eighty-four  percent  (84%,  n  =  56)  of  the  pigs
that  tested  positive  for  Salmonella  spp.  were  non-diarrheic.
However  using  Fisher’s  exact  test,  there  was  a  signiﬁcant
association  between  being  Salmonella  culture  positive  and
having  diarrhea  (p  =  0.008).

3.2.  Salmonella  serovars  isolated

In  total  56  Salmonella  spp.  were  isolated  from  56  piglets
and  weaners  and  following  analysis,  20  different  serovars
were  identiﬁed.  Of  all  the  36  herds  that  tested  positive
for  Salmonella  spp.,  multiple  serovars  were  isolated  from
4  (11%)  of  the  herds.  Table  1  shows  the  7  predominant
serovars  identiﬁed  in  this  study  and  their  distribution  by
district.  The  other  13  serovars  identiﬁed  included  S.  Kenya,

3.3.  Antimicrobial  susceptibility  of  Salmonella  spp.

Only  53  of  the  56  Salmonella  isolates  were  available  for
susceptibility  testing.  The  susceptibility  of  these  isolates  to
12  antimicrobials  tested  is  shown  in  Table  2.  Out  of  the  53
isolates,  19  (36%)  were  resistant  to  one  of  the  drugs,  8  iso-
lates  (15%)  were  resistant  to  two  of  the  drugs  and  3  isolates
(5.7%)  were  resistant  to  at  least  3  and  at  most  5  of  the  drugs
(Table  3).  Of  the  30  isolates  resistant  to  at  least  one  drug,  the
majority  (60%)  were  from  Gulu,  northern  Uganda.  Overall,
the  majority  (23/30)  were  resistant  to  sulfamethoxazole,  8
isolates  to  streptomycin,  7  isolates  to  trimethoprim,  3  iso-
lates  to  chloramphenicol,  2  isolates  to  ampicillin,  2  isolates
to  tetracycline  and  1  isolate  to  kanamycin.  None  of  the  iso-
lates  was  resistant  to  cefotaxime,  ceftazidime,  gentamicin,
ciproﬂoxacin  or  nalidixic  acid  (Tables  2  and  3).

Multidrug  resistance  (MDR),  deﬁned  as  resistance  to  or
ability  of  the  bacterium  to  grow  in  the  presence  of  two   or
more  antimicrobials  that  would  normally  kill  it  or  limit  its
growth  (Brichta-Harhay  et  al.,  2011),  was   recorded  in  iso-
lates  from  7  serovars  (Table  3).  Seven  of  these  MDR   isolates
were  from  “tethering  and  roaming”  and  4  MDR   isolates

were  from  “semi-intensive”  system.  Similarly,  15  non-MDR
isolates  were  from  “tethering  and  roaming”,  3  non-MDR

3.4.  Herd-level  risk  factors  for  Salmonella  infection  in
piglets  and  weaners

Data  from  the  two  districts  were  combined  for  the  anal-
ysis  of  risk  factors  since  the  management  of  the  pig  herds
was  similar  in  the  two  districts.  From  the  univariable  anal-
≤
ysis,  11  variables  with  p 
  0.25  were  identiﬁed  as  possible
risk  factors.  However,  many  of  the  variables  were  collinear
(Table  4)  and  only  4  of  them  were  included  in  the  best  ﬁtted
model  (multivariable  analysis).

The  best  ﬁtted  multivariable  model  with  the  lowest
AIC  value  (120.01),  deviance/DF  value  =  1.02  and  judged  as
signiﬁcant  (p  =  0.011,  Table  5)  included  the  following  vari-
ables:  feeding  the  adults  and  the  piglets  together  or  not,
management  method,  diarrhea  seen  or  not  seen  in  some
of  the  piglets/weaners  in  a  herd  during  sampling  and  the
intensity  of  cleaning  of  the  feeders.  Apart  from  diarrhea
≤0.05,  as
seen  or  not,  the  other  3  variables  had  p-values 
assessed  using  the  Type  III  sums  of  squares  test  and  there-
fore,  considered  signiﬁcantly  associated  with  Salmonella
status.

From  the  goodness  of  ﬁt  statistics,  clustering  due  to
over-dispersion  was  not  considered  as  a  problem  even  if
more  than  one  sample  was  tested  in  each  herd,  since  the
deviance/DF  value  was  close  to  1.  Therefore,  the  model
ﬁtted  well  to  the  data.  This  model  identiﬁed  feeding  the
adults  and  the  piglets  separately  versus  feeding  together
(p  =  0.043,  Odds  Ratio  (OR)  =  4.3;  95%  Conﬁdence  Interval
(CI)  1.1,  17.4)  as  a  risk  factor  for  increased  prevalence  of
Salmonella  spp.  However,  a  number  of  protective  factors
were  identiﬁed  and  included  “intensive”  method  of  rearing
versus  “tethering  and  roaming”  (p  =  0.016,  OR  =  0.11;  95%
CI  0.02,  0.64),  “intensive”  method  versus  “semi-intensive”
(p  =  0.048,  OR  =  0.12;  95%  CI  0.01,  0.96)  and  cleaning  feeders
after  every  two  days  versus  daily  (p  =  0.017,  OR  =  0.18;  95%
CI  0.05,  0.72).

4.  Discussion

infections 

in  village  pigs 

This  study  has  revealed  valuable  information  on  the
occurrence  of  Salmonella 
in
Uganda.  The  Salmonella  fecal  prevalence  of  12%  found  in
this  study  is  comparable  to  the  8.6%  prevalence  reported
from  slaughter  pigs  in  Kenya  (Kikuvi  et  al.,  2010),  but
lower  than  the  21.8%  prevalence  in  slaughter  pigs  from
Ethiopia  (Molla  et  al.,  2006).  It  is  possible,  that  these  results
could  have  been  affected  by  the  methods  employed  in  the
selection  of  the  herds,  but  we  believe  that  by  sampling  to
redundancy,  it  did  not  have  a  large  impact.  Interestingly,
unlike  in  the  previous  studies  in  Kenya  and  Ethiopia  (Molla
et  al.,  2006;  Kikuvi  et  al.,  2010),  the  current  study  has  shown
a  high  diversity  of  Salmonella  serovars  (20  serovars,  from
56  isolates).  The  reasons  for  this  may   be  difﬁcult  to  analyze,
given  the  limited  information  on  Salmonella  spp.  in  animals
from  Uganda.  However,  this  high  diversity  may   suggest  a
complex  ﬂow  of  Salmonella  spp.  in  the  study  area.  This  may
include  the  transmission  between  domestic  and  wild  ani-
mals,  and  humans.  The  average  sample  size  per  litter  in
this  study  was  considered  high  taken  into  consideration
the  average  litter  size  of  8  piglets  or  5  weaners  recorded  in
the  households  visited.  In  addition,  the  average  sample  size
was  also  higher  than  the  number  of  samples  (3  piglets)  used
in  another  study  (Funk  et  al.,  2001).  This  was  to  increase
the  sensitivity  for  isolating  Salmonella  spp.  in  a  herd  since
fecal  swab  samples  used  in  this  study  have  previously  been
reported  to  have  low  relative  sensitivity  (Funk  et  al.,  2000).
Among  the  predominant  serovars,  S.  Typhimurium  and
S.  Stanleyville  were  only  isolated  from  northern  Uganda
and  S.  Kampala  from  eastern  Uganda.  Although  there  is
no  previous  information  on  the  distribution  of  Salmonella
serovars  in  these  regions,  this  result  may   suggest  a  dif-
ference  in  predominant  serovars  in  the  different  regions.
Also,  the  predominant  serovars  in  this  study  were  differ-
ent  from  all  or  some  of  those  reported  predominant  in
pigs  from  Kenya  (S.  Saintpaul  and  S.  Heidelberg),  Ethiopia
(S.  Hadar,  S.  Kentucky,  S.  Anatum  and  S.  Blockley),  South
Africa  (S.  Typhimurium,  S.  Muenchen,  S.  Derby  and  S.
Choleraesuis),  in  Europe  (S.  Typhimurium  and  S.  Rissen),
in  the  USA  (S.  Agona,  S.  Derby,  S.  Schwarzengrund,  S.
Typhimurium  and  S.  Senftenberg)  and  Thailand  (S.  Rissen,
S.  Typhimurium,  S.  Stanley,  and  S.  Weltevreden)  (Bahnson
et  al.,  2006;  Molla  et  al.,  2006;  Dorn-In  et  al.,  2009;  Kikuvi
et  al.,  2010;  Kidanemariam  et  al.,  2010;  Vico  et  al.,  2011).
Geographical  differences  in  the  distribution  of  the  pre-
dominant  Salmonella  serovars  have  also  been  reported  in
other  countries  (Davison  et  al.,  2003).  These  differences
strengthen  the  argument  that  there  may   be  regional  differ-
ences  in  common  reservoirs  and/or  risk  factors  of  infection.
Most  of  the  Salmonella  spp.  were  from  non-diarrheic  piglets
and  weaners,  an  indication  that  these  infections  may   have
been  subclinical  at  the  time  of  sampling.

A  majority  of  the  MDR   Salmonella  spp.  were  from
northern  Uganda.  Since  antimicrobial  use  is  a  risk  factor
for  increased  drug  resistance  (McGarock,  2002;  Byarugaba,
2004),  this  result  may   suggest  a  high  antimicrobial  use  or
misuse  in  northern  as  compared  to  eastern  Uganda.  The  six
MDR   patterns  found  in  this  study  were;  sulfamethoxazole-
trimethoprim

commonly  used.  This  may   explain  the  occurrence  of
multidrug  resistance  against  these  drugs.  The  diversity
of  the  Salmonella  spp.,  the  MDR   patterns  found  and  the
management  system  where  drug  resistance  was  mostly
detected,  suggest  that  the  Salmonella  spp.  are  circulating
not  only  from  pigs  to  humans,  but  also  from  humans  to
pigs  possibly  through  contact  with  human  feces,  because
of  the  poor  sanitation  and  unhygienic  conditions  that  may
be  common  in  these  areas  (UDHS,  2011).  We   therefore
hypothesize  that  humans  are  one  of  the  main  reservoirs
of  Salmonella  spp. 
in  these  areas  and  further  studies
are  warranted  to  unravel  the  routes  of  transmission.
Resistance  to  chloramphenicol  and  sulfamethoxazole  may
also  be  an  indicator  of  illegal  use/misuse  of  the  drugs  in
animals.

Most  of  the  drug-resistant  Salmonella  spp.  (77%)  were
resistant  to  sulfamethoxazole  and  23%  to  trimethoprim.
The  level  of  resistance  to  these  drugs  is  worrisome  since
cotrimoxazole  (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  combina-
tion)  is  the  drug  commonly  used  to  control  opportunistic
infections  in  HIV  positive  persons  in  Uganda  (Campbell
et  al.,  2012).  We   recommend  for  a  wider  study  that  includes
bacterial  isolates  from  different  regions  and  species  includ-
ing  humans  in  order  to  assess  the  overall  effectiveness
of  these  two  drugs  in  the  country.  All  the  Salmonella
isolates  in  this  study  were  susceptible  to  gentamicin,
ciproﬂoxacin,  nalidixic  acid,  cefotaxime  and  ceftazidime.
These  results  are  similar  to  the  results  from  previous  stud-
ies  in  Uganda  (Kalule  et  al.,  2012)  and  Kenya  (Kikuvi  et  al.,
2010).  Apart  from  gentamicin,  the  other  four  antimicrobials
(ciproﬂoxacin,  nalidixic  acid,  cefotaxime  and  ceftazidime)
are  only  licensed  for  the  use  in  humans  in  Uganda  (NDA,
2013).  In  addition,  some  of  these  drugs  are  very  expensive
and  therefore  not  commonly  used.  This  may   be  a  possi-
ble  reason  for  the  high  susceptibility  of  the  pig-derived
isolates  of  Salmonella  to  these  drugs  in  the  present  study.
However,  resistance  to  ﬂuoroquinolones  and  third  gen-
eration  cephalosporins  in  Salmonella  spp.  from  pigs  and
other  food  animals  is  reported  in  monitoring  programs  in
North  America  and  Europe  (USDA,  2010;  CIPARS,  2011;
EFSA  and  ECDC,  2013),  and  also  from  South-East  Asia
(Van  et  al.,  2012).  Although  still  mostly  uncommon,  occur-
rence  of  these  types  of  resistance  seems  to  be  increasing
in  some  Salmonella  serovars  in  some  animal  species  in
these  regions.  There  is  therefore  need  for  continuous  mon-
itoring,  restrictions  and  judicious  use  of  these  critically
important  antimicrobials  to  ensure  the  future  availabil-
ity  of  effective  antimicrobial  drugs  for  use 
in  human
medicine.

In  this  study,  one  factor  associated  with  increased
prevalence  of  Salmonella  spp.  was  feeding  the  piglets  and
the  adults  separately.  This  ﬁnding  may   be  difﬁcult  to
explain,  although  it  may   suggest  that  Salmonella  infec-
tions  in  rural  pigs  from  Uganda  are  acquired  through
feeds.  Although  the  importance  of  contaminated  feeds
in  the  epidemiology  of  Salmonella  in  pigs  is  contentious
(Funk  and  Gebreyes,  2004),  the  Quantitative  Microbiolog-
ical  Risk  Assessment  by  EFSA  reported  that  by  feeding
only  Salmonella-free 
feeds,  slaughter  pig  prevalence
reductions  of  10%–20%  and  60%–70%  in  high  and  low  preva-
lence  EU  member  states  respectively,  could  be  expected

(EFSA,  2010).  In  addition,  studies  in  Europe  have  reported
that  feed  physical  and  chemical  composition  and  struc-
ture  are  associated  with  pig  Salmonella  prevalence  (Funk
and  Gebreyes,  2004).  This  indicates  the  possible  impor-
tance  of  contaminated  feeds  or  different  feed  types  given
to  pigs  in  the  epidemiology  of  Salmonella.  However  in
this  study,  the  questionnaire  did  not  include  necessary
information  that  could  have  been  used  to  explain  this  ﬁnd-
ing.

In  addition,  “intensive”  keeping  of  pigs  as  compared  to
“tethering  and  roaming”  or  “semi-intensive”,  and  washing
the  feeders  after  every  second  day  instead  of  daily  were
signiﬁcantly  associated  with  low  Salmonella  prevalence.
Compared  to  “tethering  and  roaming”  pigs,  “intensively”
kept  pigs  do  not  directly  interact  with  the  open  environ-
ment  and  other  animals  that  can  be  a  source  of  infection
and  this  might  be  an  explanation  to  the  lower  infection
rate  in  the  “intensive”  units.  This  argument  is  supported
by  previous  ﬁndings  (Cardinale  et  al.,  2010;  Gotter  et  al.,
2012)  that  reported  contact  with  other  animals  as  a  risk  fac-
tor  for  Salmonella  infections  in  pigs.  From  our  observations
during  data  collection,  all  “intensive”  units  had  concrete
ﬂoors  whereas  “semi-intensive”  units  had  a  larger  part  or
the  whole  of  the  ﬂoor  being  mud.  This  probably  meant  that
the  “intensive”  units  were  easy  to  clean  which  could  have
reduced  the  level  of  contamination.  Moreover  farmers  who
washed  feeders  after  every  two  days  possibly  did  it  ade-
quately,  hence  reducing  the  prevalence  of  Salmonella  spp.
in  such  units.

In  conclusion,  piglets  and  weaners  in  the  study  area
were  highly  infected  with  non-typhi  Salmonella  spp.  sug-
gesting  that  pork  and  pork  products  could  be  a  source
of  these  bacteria  for  humans  and  the  high  diversity
of  Salmonella  serovars  suggests  the  presence  of  many
reservoirs.  Therefore  we   recommend  a  comprehensive
study  to  include  other  possible  carriers/reservoirs  of  these
Salmonella  serovars,  including  the  possible  re-cycling  of
the  infection  from  humans  to  pigs.  Although  pork  is  gen-
erally  consumed  roasted  or  cooked  in  Uganda,  there  is
possible  spread  of  Salmonella  during  slaughter  in  rural
areas  due  to  poor  hygiene  and  lack  of  sensitization  on
possible  contamination  of  pork,  persons  and  other  mate-
rials.  It  is  therefore,  important  to  carry  out  studies  on
possible  transmission  of  Salmonella  in  slaughter  places.
Antimicrobial  resistance  in  these  Salmonella  spp.  against
some  of  the  common  drugs  used  in  humans  suggests  drug
misuse  or  circulation  of  the  bacteria  between  humans,
the  environment  and  pigs.  There  is  therefore  a  need  for
more  elaborate  studies  of  antimicrobial  susceptibility  of
Salmonella  spp.  along  the  pig  value  chain  so  as  to  come
up  with  policies  to  combat  this  problem.  Lastly,  this  study
has  revealed  possible  protective  factors  such  as  “inten-
sive”  piggery  that  could  be  promoted  in  Salmonella  and
antimicrobial  resistance  reduction  programs  in  rural  pigs  in
Uganda.
