Abstract

Aim: The present study was designed to study antibiotic resistance profile of E. coli isolates from colibacillosis in layers in 
and around Pantnagar. 
Materials and Methods: A total of 20 isolates of E. coli were recovered from 35 cases of colibacillosis in layers during 
necropsy. Antibiogram was studied via disc diffusion method against 12 antibiotics.
Results: Results showed multiple drug resistance in 52.63% E. coli isolates. Serotyping of these isolates revealed 10 'O' 
group serotypes, predominantly O80 and O84 accounting for 31.57%. O80, O110, O119 and O132 have previously been 
isolated from human suggesting its zoonotic importance. A high degree of resistance was seen against cephalexin (73.68%) 
whereas chloramphenicol was found to be maximally (100%) effective. Emergence of enhanced mechanism of resistance to a 
variety of frequently used antibiotics is an increasing public health problem.
Conclusion: It can be concluded that animals and human are at potential risk of acquiring infection with multi drug resistant 
strain of E. coli.

Introduction

E. coli has become a great concern in both human 
and veterinary practices. Although ubiquitous in nature, 
it plays a vital role in maintaining homeostasis of intestinal 
physiology of poultry [1]. It is not detrimental as long 
as it is kept in check by other intestinal microflora [2] 
but whenever there is imbalance, it results in colibacillosis, a 
disease of severe economic significance to all poultry 
producers, worldwide, characterized by a diverse array 
of lesions [3, 4]. This disease is of immense zoonotic 
importance since poultry meat is the commonest source 
of animal protein consumed by human population in 
most parts of the world [5]. There is increase in both 
incidence  and  severity  of  colibacillosis  and  current  Materials and Methods
trends indicate that it is likely to continue and become 
an even greater problem in the poultry industry [6]. 
Now, there is considerable increase in prevalence of 
this disease in layers indicative of an alarming situation  
[7]. 

Antibiotics are extensively used in poultry industry 
either as a growth promoter or to control infectious 
diseases [8]. Concern about antibiotic resistance and 
www.veterinaryworld.org 

its  transmission  to  human  pathogens  is  important 
because  these  resistant  bacteria  may  colonize  the 
human intestinal tract and may contribute resistance 
genes  to  human  endogenous  microflora  through  R-
factor, conjugative plasmid, or chromosomal elements 
as reviewed by Kabir [9]. Therefore, disease-causing 
microbes that have become resistant to antibiotic drug 
therapy are an increasing public health problem.

Due to the significance of E. coli infection in 
poultry industry, the present study was envisaged with 
the  objectives  of  isolation  of  E.  coli  from  various 
poultry samples and to study their antibiotic resistance 
pattern against wider range of antibiotics.

Collection  of  samples:  A  total  of  35  faecal  and 
carcass  samples  were  collected  using  sterile  cotton 
swab (Himedia, India), under strict aseptic condition, 
from morbid white leg horn birds of varied age groups 
(0 to 6 weeks of age) that were brought to Department 
of Veterinary Microbiology from areas in and around 
Pantnagar. Sampling were made as per the guidelines

animals (poultry) leads to fluoroquinolone resistance

From  the  present  findings,  it  can  be  clearly 
demonstrated  that  multiple  antibiotic  resistant 
zoonotic E. coli are alarmingly high in poultry birds in 
and around Pantnagar. Therefore, to keep an eye on 
antibiotic  resistance,  introduction  of  surveillance 
programme  is  strongly  recommended  since  trans-
mission  of  resistant  plasmids  from  food  animals 
(poultry)  to  humans  can  occur.  Synergistic  anti-
microbial combinations must be practiced only after 
sensitivity  testing,  at  an  optimal  dose  for  sufficient 
time duration, in order to avoid antibiotic resistance.
