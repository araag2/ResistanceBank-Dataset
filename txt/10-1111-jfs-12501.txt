Abstract
The present investigation was done to study the prevalence and antibiotic resistance properties
of S. aureus strains isolated from hospitals foods. Four-hundred and fifty-seven raw and cooked
hospital food samples were collected and transferred to laboratory. Samples were cultured and
S. aureus isolates were subjected to disk diffusion method. Forty-seven out of 457 (10.28%)
hospital food samples harbored S. aureus. Chicken meat (27.02%), meat barbecue (16.12%) and
salad (7.14%) were the most commonly contaminated samples. S. aureus strains exhibited the
highest levels of resistance against penicillin (70.21%), tetracycline (59.57%) and trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole (51.06%). Prevalence of resistance against ceftaroline (25.53%) and chloram-
phenicol (27.65%) were low. High prevalence of S. aureus in raw and cooked hospital food sam-
ples showed insufficiency of cooking time and temperature in the kitchens of hospitals as well
as lack of personal hygiene. Further studies are essential to assess other microbiological and epi-
demiological aspects of the S. aureus.

Practical applications
Due to the general weakness of hospitalized patients, hospital food samples should have a high
microbial quality. Staphylococcus aureus is common foodborne bacteria with an emergence of
antibiotic resistance. This study emphasizes the importance of multidrug resistant S. aureus in
hospital food sample. Results represented that hospital food samples may act as a reservoir of
S. aureus with ability to transfer antibiotic resistance.

INTRODUCTION

S. aureus is a gram-positive coccal bacterium of a Firmicutes fam-

ily. It is the most prevalent cause of foodborne diseases in hospital

Using from expert-based food diet is one of the main aspects of treat-

S. aureus strains are responsible for severe foodborne diseases and

have an acceptable level of hygiene. In keeping with this, bacterial

contamination of food are the most prevalent causes for foodborne

diseases in hospitals (Kibret & Abera, 2012; Ranjbar, Masoudimanesh,

Dehkordi, Jonaidi-Jafari, & Rahimi, 2017).

disorders known by weakness, vomiting, nausea, abdominal cramps,

and diarrhea (Scallan et al., 2011). It is also responsible for about

250,000 foodborne diseases and disorders each year in the United

States (Bunnueang et al., 2015; Costa et al., 2015; Kadariya et al.,

2014; Kluytmans, 2010).

Pathogenic S. aureus strains isolated from food samples are mainly
associated with the emergence of antibiotic resistance (ArgudÃ­n et al.,
2012; Kelman et al., 2011; Sallam, Abd-Elghany, Elhadidy, & Tamura,
2015; San Sit et al., 2017). Pathogenic S. aureus strains have the high-
est prevalence of resistance against beta-lactams and especially meth-
icillin (ArgudÃ­n et al., 2012; Kelman et al., 2011; Sallam et al., 2015;
San Sit et al., 2017). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteria are
more resistant than other strains and are usually caused severe dis-
eases (ArgudÃ­n et al., 2012; Kelman et al., 2011; Klevens et al., 2007;
Sallam et al., 2015; San Sit et al., 2017). Documented data represented
that the pathogenic S. aureus strains exhibited the high prevalence of
resistance against aminoglycosides,
lincosamides, tetracyclines, and
macrolides antibiotics (ArgudÃ­n et al., 2012; Kelman et al., 2011;
Klevens et al., 2007; Sallam et al., 2015; San Sit et al., 2017).

According to the uncertain status of the microbial quality of hos-
pital food samples, the present investigation was carried out to study
the prevalence rate and antibiotic resistance pattern of the pathogenic
S. aureus strains isolated from various types of raw and cooked hospi-
tal food samples.

2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 | Ethical issues

The study was approved by the Ethical Council of Research of the
Faculty of Veterinary Medicine University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran
(Consent Ref Number 7507001/6/36). Verification of this research
project and the licenses related to sampling process were approved by
the Prof. A. A. Basti and Prof. E. Rahimi (Approval Ref Number FHQC
2016/10).

2.2 | Samples

A total of 457 hospital food samples including raw meat (n = 38) and
raw chicken (n = 37) and meat barbecue (n = 31), chicken barbecue
(n = 82), soup (n = 94), salad (n = 56), and cooked rice (n = 119) were
randomly collected during the period of June 2016 to June 2017 from
the hospitals of the Isfahan province,
Iran. Samples were directly
transferred to the laboratory in cooler with ice packs. All samples had
normal physical properties including odor, color, and consolidation.

2.3 | S. aureus isolation and identification

About 25 g of each samples were inoculated onto 225 ml of buffered
peptone water (Merck, Germany) and homogenized in a Stomacher
Bagmixer 400 W (INTERSCIENCE, Saint-Nom, France) for 2 min.
Then, 5 ml aliquot of the enriched homogenate was transferred into
50 ml Trypticase Soy Broth (Merck) supplemented with 10% NaCl
and 1% sodium pyruvate. After incubation at 35 C for 18 hr, a loop-
ful of the culture was plated onto Baird-Parker agar supplemented
with egg-yolk tellurite emulsion (Merck) and incubated overnight at
37 C. Black shiny colonies surrounded by 2â€“5-mm clear zones were
further identified on the basis of gram staining, hemolytic activity on
sheep blood agar (Merck), catalase activity, coagulated test (rabbit
plasma), oxidase test, glucose O/F test, resistance to bacitracin

(0.04 U), mannitol fermentation on Mannitol salt agar (Merck), urease
activity, nitrate reduction, phosphatase, deoxyribonuclease (Merck)
test, Vogesâ€“Proskauer (Merck) test and carbohydrate (xylose, sucrose,
trehalose and maltose, fructose, lactose, mannose) fermentation tests
(F. S. Dehkordi et al., 2017).

2.4 | Evaluation of the antibiotic resistance

Simple disk diffusion method using the Muellerâ€“Hinton agar (Merck)
medium was used for study the antibiotic resistance pattern of the
S. aureus strains. Principles of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute were used for determination of the antibiotic resistance pat-
tern of the S. aureus strains (Pa, 2015). Susceptibility of S. aureus iso-
lates were tested against penicillin (10 Î¼g/disk), ceftaroline (30 Î¼g/
disk), gentamicin (10 Î¼g/disk), azithromycin (15 Î¼g/disk), tetracycline
(30 Î¼g/disk), ciprofloxacin (5 Î¼g/disk), trimethoprimâ€“sulfamethoxazole
(1.25/23.75 Î¼g/disk), and chloramphenicol
(30 Î¼g/disk) antibiotic
agents (Oxoid, Hampshire, UK). The plates containing the discs were
allowed to stand for at least 30 min before incubated at 35 C  2 C
for 24 hr. The diameter of the zone of inhibition produced by each
antibiotic disc was measured and interpreted using the CLSI zone
diameter interpretative standards (Pa, 2015). S. aureus ATCC 25923
and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 were used as quality control organ-
ism in antimicrobial susceptibility determination.

2.5 | Statistical analysis

Microsoft Excel software (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) was used
for data analysis. Statistical analysis was done using the SPSS 21.0 sta-
tistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Chi-square test and Fisher's
exact two-tailed test were used to assess any significant relationship
between prevalence of S. aureus strains and antibiotic resistance pat-
tern. A p value of <.05 was considered as statistically significant level.

3 | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 | Distribution of S. aureus in different samples

Table 1 represents the prevalence of S. aureus in raw and cooked hos-
pital food samples. A total of 47 out of 457 (10.28%) hospital food
samples harbored the S. aureus. Prevalence of the S. aureus in raw
food samples with animal origin, cooked food samples with animal ori-
gin and food samples without animal origin were 26.66, 10.61, and
5.57%, respectively. Raw chicken meat samples (27.02%) had the
highest prevalence of S. aureus, while rice samples (4.20%) had the
lowest. Statistically significant difference was seen between the prev-
alence of S. aureus and types of samples (p < .05).

Using from safe and nutritious hospital food is an essential part of
treatment of hospitalized patients. Safe and complete meals encour-
age patients to eat well and give them the nutrients they need to
recover from surgery or illness.

The present investigation revealed an important public health
issue regarding the microbial quality of hospital food sample for the
presence of resistant strains of S. aureus. We found that 10.28% of
hospital food samples were contaminated with S. aureus strains which

tal foods), and Momtaz, Dehkordi, Rahimi, Ezadi, and Arab (2013)

reasons for the high prevalence of S. aureus in hospital food samples.
At first, presence of the nurses and employees of hospitals (which
maybe the sources of pathogenic and resistant S. aureus strains) in the
distribution of food to patients. (Ranjbar et al., 2017). At second, the
possibility for transmission of pathogenic and resistant strains of
S. aureus from the polluted environment of hospital into the food sam-
ple (Ranjbar et al., 2017). At third, factors that are related to the food
including low quality of primary materials, long-term process of food
preparing, food storage at improper temperatures, lack of adequate
time and temperature for cooking of food and especially meat, cook-
ing of meat over than daily needs, using from contaminated equip-
ment for cooking of food, and finally reduction of food quality during
delivery process (Ranjbar et al., 2017).

Bovine and poultry meat samples are the main sources of patho-
genic S. aureus strains (Costa et al., 2015; de Jonge et al., 2010; Diede-
ren et al., 2007; Hanson et al., 2011; Jackson et al., 2013; Kelman
et al., 2011; Momtaz, Dehkordi, Rahimi, Asgarifar, & Momeni, 2013).
Therefore, it is not surprising that the prevalence of S. aureus in raw
meat and chicken meat were 26.31 and 27.02%, respectively. High
prevalence of S. aureus in cooked hospital food samples is maybe due
to the survival of S. aureus strains of raw food samples after their
insufficient and transient cooking. In addition, the possibility of trans-
mission of pathogenic S. aureus strains from infected staffs and chefs
of kitchen of hospitals into the foods is another probable reason.
Preparation of rice needs higher temperature and also more times
which make it clean from any pathogenic bacteria (Ranjbar et al.,
2017). Chicken meat is a source of S. aureus. It has been estimated
that using from poultry-based materials like chicken paste in prepara-
tion of the meat barbecue is a probable reason for the high prevalence
of S. aureus in these samples. High microbial quality of chicken paste
has been reported previously (Al-Dughaym & Altabari, 2010;
Madahi, Rostami, Rahimi, & Dehkordi, 2014; Singh, Sahoo, Chatli, &
Biswas, 2014).

(Iran, 28.05% in chicken meat). Findings of our previous study

3.2 | Antibiotic resistance pattern

(F. S. Dehkordi et al., 2017) revealed that the prevalence of MRSA

strains in raw hospital food samples with animal origin, cooked hospi-

tal food samples with animal origin and hospital food samples without

animal origin were 16.66%, 9.09% and 4.08% which showed the

higher prevalence of bacteria in raw food samples with animal origin.

Prevalence of S. aureus in food samples of the Brazilian (Costa et al.,
2015) and Turkish hospitals (AyÃ§iÃ§ek, Aydogan, KÃ¼Ã§Ã¼kkaraaslan,
Baysallar, & BasÂ¸ustaoglu, 2004) were 28.10 and 70%, respectively,
which were higher than our findings. Costa et al. (2015) reported that

of 114 studied raw hospital food samples, 28.10% were positive for

MRSA, which comprised 23.3% beef, 23.3% chicken, 37.5% pork, and

30% fish samples. Assefa, Tasew, Wondafrash, and Beker (2015)

reported that 23.50% of the food handlers of public places harbored

the S. aureus in their hand surface which can easily transmit them into

the foods.

Buccheri et al. (2007) reported that there was a generalized lack

of knowledge about etiologic agents and food vehicles associated

with foodborne diseases and proper temperatures of storage of hot

and cold ready to eat food samples. There were numerous probable

resistance against penicillin (70.21%),

Table 2 represents the antibiotic resistance pattern of the S. aureus
strains isolated from various types of hospital food samples. We found
that the S. aureus strains of our investigation harbored the highest
prevalence of
tetracycline
(59.57%), and trimethoprimâ€“sulfamethoxazole (51.06%). The lowest
prevalence of resistance was seen against ceftaroline (25.53%) and
chloramphenicol (27.65%). Statistically significant difference was seen
between the origin of samples and prevalence of antibiotic resis-
tance (p < .05).

Iranian veterinary and medical practitioners usually use from dif-
ferent types of antibiotic without any attention to the findings
obtained from the simple screening techniques like disk diffusion
method for treatment of infections. Therefore, it is not surprising that
S. aureus strains of our investigation harbored the high levels of resis-
tance against penicillin, tetracycline, and trimethoprimâ€“sulfamethoxazole
antibiotic agents.

Azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftaroline are human-based
antibiotics. On the other hand, prescription of these antibiotics is not
routine in veterinary fields. The high prevalence of resistance against

these antibiotics showed that isolated S. aureus strains were probably
derived from infected humans due to the cross contamination
(Ranjbar et al., 2017). Jackson et al. (2013) reported that the preva-
lence of resistance against ampicillin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, clinda-
mycin, erythromycin, gentamicin,
levofloxacin, oxacillin, penicillin,
rifampin, tetracycline, and trimethoprimâ€“sulfamethoxazole antibiotics
in the S. aureus strains isolated from beef samples were 100, 75, 100,
25, 100, 0, 100, 100, 100, 0, 25, and 0%, respectively. Momtaz, Deh-
kordi, Rahimi, Ezadi, et al.
(2013) and Momtaz, Dehkordi, Rahimi,
Asgarifar, et al. (2013) indicated that S. aureus strains isolated from
chicken meat samples had high levels of resistance against streptomy-
cin (31.70%), tetracycline (97.56%), trimethoprim (31.70%), enrofloxa-
cin (28.04%), gentamicin (29.26%),
sulfamethoxazole (31.70%),
cephalothin (17.07%), ampicillin (26.82%), chloramphenicol (20.73%),
and methicillin (75.60%) antibiotics which were similar to our findings.
Osman et al. (2017) reported that S. aureus strains of food samples
collected from Egypt had high prevalence of resistance against ampi-
cillin (26.08%), methicillin (34.78%), erythromycin (26.08%), chloram-
phenicol (4.34%), ciprofloxacin (30.43%), vancomycin (39.13%), and
tetracycline (26.08%) antibiotics. They showed that 96% of strains
were resistant to penicillin and trimethoprimâ€“sulfamethoxazole antibi-
otics. Cost of antibiotics, their availability, and idea of veterinarian and
medical practitioners for their prescription are the main factors that
affected the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in each region.

measures should be address before the vast spread of S. aureus infec-

tions in hospital environment. Primary identification of the cases of

food poisoning due to consumption of contaminated hospital food

samples and their treatment can reduce the risk of dissemination of

S. aureus in Iranian hospitals.
