Abstract

Aim: To conduct detailed pathomicrobial studies on Salmonella Gallinarum infection in broiler chickens.
Materials and Methods: Bacteriological and pathological studies were conducted on 134 dead poultry birds collected from 
23 different farms suspected to be infected with S. Gallinarum. 
Results: Mortality pattern revealed that maximum mortality occurred in 1-2 week aged birds. Out of 23 Salmonella isolates, 
19 samples were identified as S. Gallinarum (9, 12) and 4 samples as Salmonella Enteritidis (9, 12: gm). Isolates were found to 
be most sensitive to Polymyxin B (100%). The present study also showed re-emergence of chloramphenicol sensitivity 
(83.33%). Pathological lesions observed were bronze discolouration of liver, splenomegaly and necrotic foci on liver, spleen 
and  heart.  Microscopically,  liver  and  spleen  revealed  aggregation  of  heterophils,  lymphocytes  and  macrophages,  non-
suppurative myocarditis, fibrinous pericarditis, interstitial nephritis, necrotic enteritis and serofibrinous pneumonia. 
Conclusion: It was concluded that S. Gallinarum 9, 12 was the main serotype causing Salmonellosis in poultry birds.   
Polymyxin B was the most sensitive drug (100%) for Salmonella infection along with re-emergence of chloramphenicol 
sensitivity for Salmonella (83.33%) infection.
Key words: broiler, drug sensitivity, pathology, Salmonella Gallinarum

Conclusion

S.  Gallinarum  9,  12  was  mainly  involved  in 
causing  Salmonellosis  in  poultry  birds  tested  in  the 
present study. In some of the cases S. Enteritidis was 
also isolated. Polymyxin B was the most sensitive drug 
(100%) for treating Salmonella infections.  Surprisingly, 
our study also revealed that Salmonella infections are 
also highly sensitive to chloramphenicol .

Intestine: Grossly, catarrhal enteritis was evident in 
some  cases  characterized  by  thick  slimy  mucus 
exudate on mucosal surfaces in the lumen of intestine. 
Histopathologically  there  was  desquamation  of 
mucosal  epithelium  resulting  in  denuded  villi  and 
lumen was filled with necrotic mass (Fig.7). Secretory 
glands  were  atrophied  at  some  places  due  to  severe 
infiltration  of  heterophils  and  mononuclear  cells. 
Goblet  cell  hyperplasia  and  focal  fibroblastic 
connective tissue proliferation between the glands was 
present  in  many  cases.  Giannella  [32]  reported  that 
Salmonella  induced  diarrhoea  is  multifactorial.  The 
onset of fluid secretion is preceded by a massive influx 
of inflammatory cells leading to release of prostaglan-
dins that stimulate intestinal adenylcyclase mediated 
fluid secretion.

hemorrhages  along  with  mild  degenerative  changes.

connective tissue was present in most of the cases. The

Lungs: Lungs were highly congested with pneumonic  Haryana  for  providing  the  facilities  and  fund  for 
lesions in most of the cases. Microscopically moderate 
congestion  and  hemorrhages  were  observed  with 
presence of RBCs in the alveoli (red hepatization). At 
places, there was presence of serofibrinous exudate in 
alveoli  and  interlobular  septa.  Similar  lesions  have 
been reported by Shivprasad [30]. 
Kidneys:  Grossly,  kidneys  were  enlarged  with 
prominent lobulation and necrotic foci on the surface. 
Microscopically, glomeruli were contracted alongwith 
degenerative changes in the renal tubular epithelium. 
Similar  degenerative  and  infiltrative  changes  in

described by Shivaprasad [30].
Bursa of fabricius: Grossly, only mild congestion was 
observed  in  bursa  of  Fabricius.  Histopathological 
changes include mild depletion of lymphoid tissue in 

Because polymyxin B was found to be the most 
sensitive drug for Salmonella infection in the present 
study,  we  recommend  the  drug  for  treatment  of 
salmonellosis.
