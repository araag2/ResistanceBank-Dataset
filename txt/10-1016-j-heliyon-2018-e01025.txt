Abstract

Salmonella Saintpaul (SSa) is increasingly reported from food and foodborne
outbreak cases. Pulsed Ô¨Åeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is used for screening and
tracking of Salmonella infections. Widespread use of antimicrobial agents in
in antimicrobial resistant Salmonella
humans and food animals could result
serotypes. The aim of this study was to characterize S. Saintpaul (n ¬º 28)
isolated from various sampling locations at abattoir and meat processing plant
lines in Ethiopia for phenotypic antimicrobial resistance and genotypic diversity,
and to track its transfer routes. Sampling location, steps and occasions were
considered for each isolate description. Antimicrobial sensitivity testing was
performed against seven diÔ¨Äerent antimicrobial agents using disc diÔ¨Äusion
method. PFGE with XbaI√í enzymatic genomic digestion with BioNumerics√í
analysis was used for genotypic diversity. Of all the isolates tested, only 17.9%
were pan susceptible, and 82.1% were resistant to at least one and at most to
three antimicrobials. All isolates were susceptible to gentamycin, trimethoprim-

sulfamethoxazol and trimethoprim. Resistance to oxytetracycline (82.2%) was
predominant followed by 3.6% resistance to each of chloramphenicol, neomycin
and polymyxin B. PFGE analysis revealed three distinguishable clusters of
pulsotypes but the majority of the isolates (25/28) belonged to cluster-I (SSaX1-
4) pulsotype. Indistinguishable/similar cluster of (SSaX 1-4) isolates among and
between sampling location, steps and occasions were observed. Majorities of S.
Saintpaul (88%) in the cluster-I pulsotype were resistant to oxytetracycline. Our
study indicated that oxytetracycline resistance is very common among the S.
Saintpaul isolates studied; and the isolates were diverse with similar resistance
proÔ¨Åles within the same genomic pulsotypes. Transfer of S. Saintpaul within,
between and across sampling locations, during the same or diÔ¨Äerent occasion
were determined from SSaX 1-4 pulsotype while cluster-II (SSaX5) indicates
transfer from abattoir to butchery. The unique isolate in cluster-III (SSaX6)
shows the presence of other possible source of S. Saintpaul for the beef chain
contamination.

1. Introduction

Salmonella species are inhabitant of the intestinal tract of animals and distributed in
the environment which results in increasing prevalence in the global food chain and
their virulence [1]. Their adaptability properties favors easy transmission result in an
enormous medical, public health and economic impact worldwide [1, 2]. CDC [3]
reported a total of 84 persons infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Saint-
paul with 28% of ill hospitalized and no deaths were reported. Due to contamination
with Salmonella, Mead et al. [4] estimated a huge proportion of infections. case-
fatality rates of 43% and 10% for immunocompromised and 5% and 0% for non-
immunocompromised due to non-typhoid Salmonella in respective of infants and
children were also reported by Sirinavin et al. [5]. Characterization of Salmonella
involves utilization of combined phenotype and/or genotypic techniques for the dif-
ferentiation of strains speciÔ¨Åc spices and sub spices [6]. Serology based on surface
antigen [7], phage typing based on bacteriophage host proÔ¨Åle [8], antimicrobial sus-
ceptibility and biotypes of Salmonella strain [9] were used for phenotypic character-
ization. Pulsed Ô¨Åeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole-genome sequencing [10,
11] are used for genetic discrimination of Salmonella isolates including S. Saintpaul
from outbreaks and epidemiological investigations [12, 13]. In Ethiopia, little infor-
mation is available on the status of food safety where there is a ttradition raw meat
consumption which could carry risks of infection with zoonotic agents [14, 15],
where diÔ¨Äerent Salmonella serotypes were isolated from food animal, food and pro-
duction environment [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] with antimicrobial resistance test on

isolates [21] in Ethiopia. However, survey on genotypic diversity and transfer route
investigation were scares in the country. The aim of this study was to characterize S.
Saintpaul isolated from various sources at abattoir and meat processing plant in
Ethiopia for phenotypic antimicrobial resistance and genotypic diversity as well as
tracking its transfer routes along meat production and processing lines.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sampling, sample source and locations

The studied strains were originated from diÔ¨Äerent samples collected from abattoir at
Addis Ababa City and from processing plant line at Bishoftu town, 47 Km from East
of Addis Ababa City. Following the beef production and supply procedure chain
described by FAO [22], diÔ¨Äerent samples were collected from abattoir line and
the beef processing plant line. A total of 237 and 431 samples were aseptically
collected from the abattoir and the processing plant lines respectively (Table 1).

2.2. Laboratory procedure

2.2.1. Bacterial isolation

Bacterial isolation was conducted at Food Hygiene and Microbiology Laboratory,
Akililu Lemma Institute of Pathobiology, Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia
following standard protocols [7]. Pre-enrichment was performed using one portion
of sample by volume or gram was homogenized with 10 portions of buÔ¨Äer peptone
water (BPW) (Merck, Germany) at 1:10 proportion. From the pre-enriched samples,
0.1 ml and 1 ml was transferred to 10 ml of Rappaport-Vassiliadis (RV) medium
(Oxoid Hampshire, England) and 10 ml of Muller Kaufmann tetrathionate with
novobiocin (MKTTn) (Merck) broths respectively for selective enrichment. RV
and MKTTn broth cultures were then incubated at 43 C and 37 C respectively
for 18-24 hrs. A loop full was plated on Brilliant phenol lactose sucrose agar
(BPLS) (Merck) and Xylose lactose Tergitol√î 4 (XLT4) (Merck) in parallel and
incubated at 37 C for 24 hrs and 48 hrs, respectively. Presumptive colonies based
on their characteristic morphological appearances on the selective agar plates were
sub-cultured onto standard-I nutrient agar (Merck) and biochemically conÔ¨Årmed
for serotyping.

2.2.2. Serotyping

The isolates were serotyped at Microbiology Laboratory, Institute of Meat Hygiene
and Technology, Panel Veterinary Public Health, FAO Reference Center for Veter-
inary Public Health, Freie Universit‚Ç¨at Berlin, Germany. Serotyping was performed

2.2.3. Antimicrobial resistance testing

All of the isolates were tested for their phenotypic antimicrobial resistance by agar
disc diÔ¨Äusion method with antimicrobial impregnated discs (Oxoid, Hampshire, En-
gland) against polymyxin-B (PB; 300 U), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (STX;

1.25/23.75 mg), chloramphenicol (C; 50 mg), gentamycin (G; 10 mg), trimethoprim
(W; 5 mg), neomycin (N; 10 mg) and oxytetracycline (OT; 30 mg). Antimicrobial
resistance tests were performed on Mueller-Hinton agar (Oxoid) according to Bauer
Kirby agar disc diÔ¨Äusion [23] following Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute‚Äôs
protocol [24]. The isolates were sub-cultured onto standard-I nutrient agar (Merck)
and incubated at 37 C for 24 hrs. They were then inoculated into 3 ml of brain heart
infusion broth (BHI) (Merck) and again incubated for 1 hr at 37 C. The inoculum
density was standardized to 0.5 McFarland standard; from which 0.1 ml was spread
onto Mueller-Hinton agar (Oxoid). After the plates were allowed to absorb the mois-
ture; antimicrobial impregnated discs were applied; and the plates were incubated at
35  2 C for 16-18 hr. Based on the diameter of zone inhibition for Enterobacteri-
aceae, results were recorded as susceptible, intermediate or resistant [24].

2.2.4. Pulsed Ô¨Åled gel electrophoresis (PFGE) procedure

The PFGE examination of the isolates were performed following PulseNet protocol
[11] at Molecular Biology Laboratory, Institute of Meat Hygiene and Technology,
Panel Veterinary Public Health, FAO Reference Center for Veterinary Public
Health, Freie Universit‚Ç¨at Berlin, Germany. Agarose-embedded whole genomic
DNA of the isolates was digested with the restriction enzyme XbaI√í (60 U) (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Germany) enzymatic restriction. DNA fragments were sepa-
rated by PFGE in agarose gels. S. Braenderup STSAL82 (Merck, Germany) was
used as a reference strain. A 50e1000 kb Pulse markerTM (Sigma-Aldrich Co,
USA), test strains and refernce strain were loaded into 1.2% Pulsed Field CertiÔ¨Åed
Agarose√í gel. The gel running condition was set with initial pulse switch time of
2.2 seconds and the Ô¨Ånal pulse switch time of 63.8 seconds under 200 V (6 V/
cm) voltage for 20 hrs at 14 C according to Pulse Net [11]. Then, the gel was stained
with 1 mg/l ethidium bromide solution for 20-30 min on a horizontal shaker
(Certomat√íU) and twice de-stained with distilled water for 20 min. The PFGE Ô¨Åles
were processed using BioNumerics√í Ver. 6.6 software (Applied Maths BVBA, Kor-
trijk, Belgium).

2.3. Data analysis

Phenotypic antimicrobial resistance proÔ¨Åles and genotypic diversity were combined
in data entry for analysis. Antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance proÔ¨Åles were
presented as percentage. The PFGE results were analyzed by using BioNumerics√í
Version 6.6 software (Applied Maths BVBA, Kortrijk, Belgium) with optimization
of 1.0 and position tolerance of 1.5. For beef line S. Saintpaul transfer route deter-
mination, considerations were made on sampling occasion/batch (date of sampling),
sample source and locations in the studied beef production lines.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Occurrence and drug resistance proÔ¨Åle of S. Saintpaul

Except the hooks swab samples which was not positive for S. Saintpaul, all other sam-
pling locations were found positive ranging from 2.9% from MLN to 36.4% from beef
transport truck in the abattoir line. However, only one isolate (0.23%) of S. Saintpaul
from total 431 samples at beef processing plant line which is 0.8% in raw beef was
observed with other samples being negative for the serotype (Table 2). This Ô¨Ånding
indicates abattoir is highly contaminated and can act as sources of microbial patho-
gens including S. Saintpaul. The single isolate observed on meat at processing plant
line also show transfer of Salmonella via raw beef. Regardless of number, observing
the 28 isolates of S. Saintpaul from diÔ¨Äerent meat production and processing environ-
mental, animal and beef product locations indicates wide distribution of this serotype
in Ethiopia. The present Ô¨Ånding was consistent with the 45 (38.8%) [19] from camel
and its meat, one isolate [17] from minced beef, 14.8% [20], 4.3% [18] in minced beef
from supermarkets previously reported in Ethiopia showing its distribution and occur-
rence in meat and its production area in the country. S. Saintpaul was also reported as
dominant serotype 20 (76.9%) of all isolates from poultry in Ethiopia [25].

The pan (100%) susceptible of strain to gentamicin, trimethoprim and trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazol (Table 3) show the eÔ¨Äectiveness of these antimicrobials for treat-
ment of cases of S. Saintpaul in Ethiopia. Kikuvi et al. [26] also showed eÔ¨Äectiveness
of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazol against Salmonella isolate including S. Saintpaul

isolated from pig in Kenya. However, Beutlich et al. [27] reported 78% intermediate
or full resistance of S. Saintpaul to gentamicin and 11% resistance to trimethoprim.
The observation of one isolate (3.6%) resistant to chloramphenicol in this study
was similar to reports of Kikuvi et al. [26] who reported one resistant isolate from
Kenya and Ô¨Åve (9%) Beutlich et al. [27] from Germany. On the other hand, the
82.2% resistant isolates to oxytetracycline in the present study was higher than the re-
ported in other studies from Kenya [26] and 31% [27] from Germany. The high resis-
tant isolates to oxytetracycline in this investigation could be due to frequent uses of
this drug where it is marketed as ‚Äòbroad spectrum antibiotic. The popular and widely
uses of oxytetracycline in the veterinary sector in global [28] and in Ethiopia with
associated resistance [29], were reported, too. A total of 26/28 (82.1%) of the isolates
were resistant to at least one and at most to three antimicrobials. The present Ô¨Ånding
was lower than the phenotypic and genotypic proÔ¨Åles isolates resistant for one or more
antimicrobials among the 76 isolates (2.18%) reported [30] among Non-typhoidal S.
Enterica. High frequencies of resistance to tetracycline 26.27%were also reported [30]
in Non-typhoidal S. Enterica. Presence of single to multiple drug resistant Salmonella
isolates including S. Saintpaul was also reported from poultry in Ethiopia [25].

3.2. Genomic diversity and phenotypic drug resistance proÔ¨Åle of
S. Saintpaul

Using genotypic PFGE and phenotypic drug susceptibility/resistance proÔ¨Åles, three
diÔ¨Äerent clusters of S. Saintpaul were observed along the beef production and process-
ing lines. Sibhat et al. [16] investigated Salmonella prevalence in abattoir and

recommend the need for further analysis of isolates using PFGE clustering as a tool to
assess the epidemiological and genotypic diversity in Ethiopia. Thus, the present
study shows 51.3e100% genomic relatedness of the 28 (27 from abattoir and 1
from processing plant line) S. Saintpaul. They are diÔ¨Äered into three (3) diÔ¨Äerent clus-
ters of pulsotypes1 consisted of 25 isolates in cluster-I, 2 isolates in cluster-II and 1
isolate in cluster-III (Fig. 1). These diÔ¨Äerent clusters shows the genotypic diversity
of S. Saintpaul in Ethiopia. Regardless of sample source and geographic distribution,
high degree of genetic diversity of S. Saintpaul were also reported by Kerouanton et al.
[31] showing 20 pulsotypes among the 30 isolates. Moreover, 82 of the 159 isolates
from animals, food of animal origin and humans shows only 42.6% similarity [32].

About 88% of the isolates within cluster-I were resistant to oxytetracycline with mul-
tiple drug resistance proÔ¨Åle of C-OT-PB in one of them but one isolate resistant to N
and OT (Fig. 2). Besides their genotypic similarity, 22 (88%) of the 25 isolates in
cluster-I shows resistant to oxytetracycline but all (100%) of isolates in cluster II
shows susceptibility to oxytetracycline. This indicated the phenotypical drug
response similarity of isolates within a cluster.

3.3. Tracking and tracing the possible sources and transfer
routes

The 95.2% PFGE genomic similarity among isolates in cluster-I (Fig. 1) indicates the
occurrence indistinguishable S. Saintpaul in diÔ¨Äerent sampling occasion/batch and
location including on personal hand, the abattoir room, in animal feces, meat trans-
porting truck and on the meat. All of isolates within this cluster are from abattoir line.
This indicated highly contamination of the abattoir with similar clonal of S. Saint-
paul. Laconch et al. [33] conÔ¨Årming spread of a single clone of Salmonella serotype
over a large geographical area. Using 2000 isolates, Sandvang et al. [34] the spread
between farms, survival and transmission of speciÔ¨Åc clone of Salmonella enterica
serotype Typhimurium using their identical PFGE patterns among the fecal and
environmental isolates from pig production farms units. Using PFGE generated
whole genome mapping data, Fey et al. [13] tracked the distinguishable S. Saintpaul
serotype from outbreak in relation to the temporal periods.

3.4. PFGE as tool for determining the Salmonella source and
tracing its transfer routes

The present possible sources, contamination and transfer routs of the studied S. Saint-
paul was assessed. PulseNet [11] recommended PFGE as a tool for tracking and trace
of sources of pathogens in food and outbreaks. The signiÔ¨Åcantly high (95.2%)

genotypic PFGE similarities among S. Saintpaul within cluster-I indicates the
possible transfer of the agent during the same or diÔ¨Äerent sampling occasions as
well as across locations in the abattoir line to the level of consumer supply at the
butcheries. Fey et al. [13] used to track and trace the sources of Salmonella strains
for the outback in time period using their PFGE indistinguishable properties. One
of isolate obtained from abattoir room in cluster-II was found indistinguishable
from an isolate from processing plant line (Fig. 1). This indicates abattoir could be
the sources of beef contamination which extended to the processing plant. In fact,
the studied abattoir is one of sources of raw beef for the processing plant. Using
PFGE enzymatic digestion and clustering into close relationship among the phage
types of Salmonella, sources of isolates were conÔ¨Årmed [33], spread between loca-
tions, the survival and the transmission of Salmonella were determined [34] from
an outbreaks on temporal periods [13]. Kagambega et al. [35] also try to asses poten-
tially transmit of some of the same Salmonella serotypes from wild animals to hu-
mans using the same techniques in the Burkina Faso. On the other hand the one
PFGE distinguishable S. Saintpaul in cluster-III was observed in beef at butchery.
This indicates the possibility of contamination of raw beef at public supply location
from other sources along the handling steps or at supply stages. Such occurrence, dis-
tribution and transfer of S. Saintpaul within a particular studied meat production and
processing lines in Ethiopia indicates the need for further investigation for other se-
rotypes and pathogens based on geographical region, during particular period of time
in the country [13, 32].

4. Conclusion

Our study indicated that phenotypic oxytetracycline resistance was very common
among the S. Saintpaul isolated from Ethiopia. The serotype was also found diverse
having similar genotypic and phenotypic (drug susceptibility/resistance proÔ¨Åles)
within the same genomic pulsotypes. Moreover, the presence and transfer of indistin-
guishable S. Saintpaul serotype within same sampled location, during same and/or
diÔ¨Äerent sampling occasion along beef abattoir line were observed. Transfer of the
serotype from abattoir to the butchery shop and the beef processing plant via raw
beef were conÔ¨Årmed using PFGE. Contamination of beef line from other possible sour-
ces with S. Saintpaul serotype indicates the risk of public acquiring infection. Hygiene
application along the beef production and processing line with regular drug susceptibly
test may reduce risks posed for contamination with Salmonella and public infection.
