Abstract
Background: There is paucity of information regarding the epidemiology of Escherichia coli O157: H7 in developing
countries. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of E. coli O157: H7 associated with beef cattle at processing
plants and at retail shops in Ethiopia.
Methods: Various samples were collected from beef cattle at slaughter/processing plants, carcass at retail shops
and humans at health centers. E. coli O157: H7 was isolated, identified and characterized for antimicrobial resistance,
using standard microbiological methods.
Results: At the processing plants E. coli O157: H7 was detected in 1.89% of fecal, 0.81% of intestinal mucosal swab,
0.54% of skin swab and 0.54% of carcass internal swab samples. At retail shops it was detected in 0.8% of carcass
and 0.8% of cutting board swab samples, while all samples from utensils, hands from workers, and fecal and stool
samples were negative. All isolates were resistant to Amoxicillin, moderately resistant to Cefoxitine and
Nitrofurantoins but susceptible to other antimicrobials tested.
Conclusions: E. coli O157: H7 occurs at low prevalence in beef cattle, and the current sanitary dressing procedures
in the processing plants and storage conditions in the retail shops are effective against E. coli O157: H7.

Background
Foodborne pathogens are the leading cause of illness
and death in developing countries costing billions of
dollars in medical care and social costs [1]. E. coli O157:
H7, an enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), is one of the
most
in
humans. It infects all age groups and the pathogen is
noted for its severe consequences following infection,
low infective dose and acid resistance [2]. Depending on
the immune status and the general health of the infected
individual, and the dose and virulence of the bacteria, in-
fection with E. coli O157: H7 can result in mild diarrhea,

foodborne

infections

severe bloody diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, or hemolytic
uremic syndrome (HUS) leading to kidney failure [2, 3].
Cattle are the primary reservoirs of E. coli O157:H7 and
ground beef and beef products are identified as major
sources of foodborne transmission [2, 4]. Carcass contam-
ination occurs through skin-to-carcass or fecal-to-carcass
transfer of the pathogen during slaughter process at pro-
cessing plants [5–7]; and this is the major risk factor for
human infection. Furthermore, cross-contamination can
occur during further processing of carcasses in the pro-
cessing plants, during distribution and storage of beef at
retail markets. Various pre-harvest interventions (vaccin-
ation, direct-fed microbial and bacteriophage treatment)
to reduce pathogen shedding [8, 9] and post-harvest
intervention technologies such as skin and carcass
washing, and the use of antimicrobials [10] have been
developed with varying success.

Despite greater burden caused by foodborne infections
in developing countries than developed countries, there
is acute scarcity of information on their occurrences [1].
In Ethiopia, only very few studies can be found regarding
E. coli O157:H7 in animals, animal products or people
[11–14]. Therefore producing more information on this
particularly important foodborne pathogen is crucial to
create awareness in the public and formulate preventive
measures along food production, processing, and distri-
bution continuum. The objective of this study was to in-
vestigate the occurrence of E. coli O157:H7 associated
with beef cattle at processing plants, retail shops, and in
people sampled at health centers in Ethiopia.

Methods
Sample collection
Various sample types were collected at two processing
plants (anonymously designated as plant A and plant B),
retail shops, and public health centers in Addis Ababa
and Debre Berhan cities. Plant A is located in Addis
Ababa and on average it processes about 700 heads of
cattle per day. Plant B is located in Debre Berhan and it
is relatively smaller compared to plant A, and on average
it processes about 30 heads of cattle per day. At plant A
samples were collected once per week and at plant B
twice per week with 14 and 28 sampling occasions, re-
spectively. At each visit to the plants, 10 to 15 animals
were randomly selected and sampled. Five different types
of samples from each animal (n = 370) and one pooled
environmental swab sample (n = 62) were collected dur-
ing each visit to the processing plants. Fecal, intestinal
mucosal swab, skin swab, and carcass swab samples
were
collected according to previously described
methods [7, 15]. For the collection of fecal and intes-
tinal mucosal swab samples,
the distal colon was
ligated, transected proximal to the rectum and trans-
ported on ice to the laboratory. In the laboratory, each
colon was aseptically opened and fecal samples were re-
covered.
lumen mucosa was swabbed by
using cotton tipped swabs after extra fecal content was
removed. The swabs were placed in test tubes contain-
ing 10 ml buffered peptone water (BPW; Oxoid Ltd.,
Hampshire, England).

Intestinal

Skin swabs were obtained immediately after exsan-
guination by using cotton tipped swabs presoaked in
10 ml of BPW by swabbing ≈10 × 10 cm area of the
neck covering the bleeding line. Two carcass swab sam-
ples were obtained per animal
to examine skin-to-
carcass (external part of the carcass) and fecal-to-carcass
(internal surface of carcass facing the gastrointestinal
tract) transfer of E. coli O157:H7 during dressing and
evisceration,
the
carcass was swabbed from the neck, brisket, flank and
rump using cotton tipped swabs presoaked in 10 ml of

respectively. The external part of

BPW. The internal part of the carcass was swabbed from
thoracic and pelvic parts as described above. In addition,
pooled swab samples (referred to as environmental
swabs) from knives, workers’ hands and aprons were col-
lected on each abattoir visit. At retail markets, swab
samples were collected from the carcass (n = 125), knife
(n = 125), cutting board (n = 125), and workers’ hands
(n = 125) and were placed in separate screw-capped
tubes containing 10 ml BPW. Stool samples that were
submitted to laboratories of the health centers with phy-
sicians’ orders to test for enteric pathogens were ob-
tained at two health centers in Addis Ababa and at a
referral hospital
in Debre Berhan. Stool samples were
collected from patients who were presented with diar-
rhea. All samples were kept in icebox and transported to
the laboratory.

Sample processing for prevalence
After the colon was aseptically opened 25 g of feces
was transferred into a stomacher bag to which 225 ml
of modified tryptone soya broth supplemented with
20 mg/l novobiocin (mTSB + n) was added for pre-
selective enrichment. The resulting mixture was ho-
mogenized using a laboratory blender at low speed for
30 s. To all swab samples 90 ml of mTSB + n was
added and the mixture was vortexed for 30 s. All the
pre-enrichments were incubated at 41.5 °C for 24 h.
Following the incubation period, 1 mL from each en-
richment was subjected to anti-O157 immunomagnetic
separation (IMS). Enrichments (1 mL) received 20 μL of
anti-O157 beads (Dynal Biotech ASA, Oslo, Norway). The
beads were extracted from the enrichment samples and
washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline-Tween
20 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Fifty microliters of the final
bead-bacteria complexes were spread-plated onto Sorbitol
MacConkey agar (Oxoid Ltd., Hampshire, UK) containing
0.05 mg/l cefixime and 2.5 mg /l potassium tellurite (CT-
SMAC; Dynal Biotech ASA). All plates were incubated at
37 °C for 24 h. After the plates were incubated, suspect
colonies were picked and tested by an E. coli O157: H7
latex agglutination test (Oxoid Ltd., Hampshire, UK) fol-
lowing the manufacturer’s instruction.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
All E. coli O157:H7 isolates were tested for susceptibility
to a panel of 10 antimicrobial agents (Amoxicillin 25 μg,
Kanamycin 30 μg, Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole 25 μg,
Chloramphenicol 30 μg, Ciprofloxacin 5 μg, Streptomycin
10 μg, Nalidixic acid 30 μg, Cefoxitin 30 μg, Tetracycline
30 μg and Nitrofurantoin 50 μg) by agar disc diffusion
method according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute [16] procedure. Briefly, isolated colonies were in-
oculated into tryptone soya broth (Oxoid Ltd., Hampshire,
UK) and incubated for 6 h. The turbidity of the broth was

adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standards (≈3 × 108 CFU/ml)
using sterile saline solution and inoculated on Muller-
Hinton agar (Becton, Dickinson and Company, MD, USA)
using sterile cotton swabs. Antimicrobial containing discs
(Oxoid Ltd., Hampshire, UK) were applied to the surface
of the agar plates, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C
for 24 h. After incubation, the antimicrobial inhibition
zone diameters were measured and results were qualita-
tively interpreted as susceptible, intermediate or resistant
based on CLSI interpretative criteria. The antimicrobial
agents included on the disc diffusion susceptibility panels
and breakpoints used for the interpretation of results are
listed in Table 1. E. coli ATCC 25922 was used as a quality
control strain.

Statistical analysis
Stata version 13 [17] was used for the statistical analysis.
Prevalence was expressed as the percent positive sam-
ples from total samples tested. Differences in the preva-
lence of E. coli O157: H7 between the two processing
plants (A and B), sample sources (processing plants, re-
tail shops and health centers) and sample types (feces,
skin, carcass or stool) were assessed by Fisher’s exact
test. The significance level was set at α = 0.05.

Results
Prevalence of E. coli O157:H7
No statistically significant (P > 0.05) differences were ob-
served between the two processing plants,
sample
sources or sample types. Therefore, results from the two
processing plants were combined and are shown in
Table 2. E. coli O157:H7 was detected in 2% of the fecal
samples, 0.5% of the skin swabs, 0.8% of the intestinal
mucosal swabs and 0.5% of the internal carcass swabs
at the processing plants. At the retail shops, it was de-
tected in 0.8% of carcass swabs and 0.8% of cutting
board swabs examined. All samples collected from
knives and workers both at the processing plants and
retail shops, and stool samples obtained from clinically

suspected people at the health centers were negative for
E. coli O157:H7.

Antimicrobial susceptibility
All of the E. coli O157:H7 isolates (n = 16) were resistant
to Amoxicillin while intermediate resistance to Cefoxi-
tine and Nitrofurantoin. All isolates were susceptible to
the remaining seven antimicrobials (Table 3).

Discussion
The aim of the present study was to investigate the oc-
currence of E. coli O157:H7 associated with beef cattle
production, processing and distribution, and diarrheal
diseases in the public seeking health care services. The
prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 both in the fecal and
carcass swab samples collected both at the processing
plants and retail shops was low compared to previous
studies conducted in Ethiopia [11–14]. The fact that we
observed low prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in the fecal
samples (2%) and intestinal mucosa (0.8%) suggests low
infection in the beef cattle population studied. This find-
ing can be extrapolated to a larger cattle population of
Ethiopia albeit with caution. Although it is difficult to
trace back the farms of origin of the cattle slaughtered,
it is reasonable to assume that the two processing plants
represent wide catchment areas where animals can be
brought for slaughter from across the country. Our find-
ing can be confounded by the fact that cattle could be
brought both from big commercial feedlots and small
scale backyard production systems. Our study suggests
the need for large scale on-farm studies to determine the
prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 under different cattle pro-
duction systems in Ethiopia. The prevalence of E. coli
O157:H7 is associated with herd size [18] and it is more
common under concentrated animal feeding operations
compared to small herds raised typically on pasture [19].
Since the current study was limited only to two beef cat-
tle processing plants, future studies with broader scope

country are warranted.

The recto-anal junction (RAJ) of cattle is the principal
site of colonization for E. coli O157: H7 [20] and it was
argued that detection of E. coli O157: H7 in the intes-
tinal mucosa proximal to RAJ indicates persistent infec-
tion by colonization rather than pass through the GIT as
detected in the feces [21, 22]. Therefore the low preva-
lence of E. coli O157: H7 in the intestinal mucosal swabs
observed in the present study indicates low infection in
the beef cattle included in this study. Numerically, we
observed higher prevalence of E. coli O157: H7 in the
fecal samples than in the intestinal mucosal swabs which
would suggest rather a passing through of the pathogen
than colonization. This was contrary to observation
made by Fox et al., [23] in which the prevalence of E.
coli O157:H7 in the rectal mucosa was twice as much as
that observed in the colon content or feces.

The skin of cattle is a significant source for E. coli
O157: H7 contamination of beef, with the potential for

the pathogen transfer onto the carcass during slaughter-
ing and dressing processes [19]. Skin contamination oc-
curs from direct or indirect fecal contamination in beef
cattle production and lairage environments; and plays a
significant role for downstream carcass contamination.
Cross contamination of skins with feces can also occur
when a group of cattle is transported or held together in
close quarters thus increasing the prevalence of E. coli
O157: H7 on skins. Level of skin contamination is posi-
tively associated with the fecal prevalence of in-coming
cattle to the processing plants [19]. Compared to studies
reported in other countries, the prevalence (0.91%) of E.
coli O157: H7 on the skin swabs found in this study is
comparatively low. This can be attributed to differences
in the factors which can potentially affect skin contamin-
ation,
including fecal shedding, abattoir management
system, farming systems, lairage related conditions, dur-
ation of farm/market-to-abattoir transport and hygienic
conditions along unloading-to-stunning areas. In this
study we note that low prevalence of E. coli O157: H7
on skin swabs is expected since its observed prevalence
(2% in the fecal samples and 0.8% in the intestinal mu-
cosal swabs) in the cattle population was low. The
swabbing site could have an effect on the prevalence of
E. coli O157: H7 in the skin swab samples. Contrary to
other studies [24] which obtained skin swab samples
from the shoulder of an animal, we swabbed the ventral
surface of the animal over the sternum (brisket) extend-
ing over the neck area. This was based on the assump-
tion that as cattle rest in sternal recumbence, this site
would be in contact with fecal matter on the ground
thus maximizing skin contamination. Also, since our
swabbing site included the bleeding site this would fa-
cilitate entry of the pathogen to carcass surface during
slaughtering process. Even though our
sampling
method (using cotton tipped swabs instead of sponges)
and selection of swabbing site (ventral part of
the

Abdissa et al. BMC Infectious Diseases  (2017) 17:277 

Page 5 of 6

animal) could have contributed to the low apparent
prevalence of E. coli O157: H7 in the skins samples, this
effect can be considered minimal compared to the im-
pact of low overall prevalence of E. coli O157: H7 ob-
served in the cattle population studied.

We observed low level of carcass contamination by E.
coli O157: H7 at the processing plants (0.54%) or retail
shops (0.43%). This can be attributed generally to the
low prevalence of E. coli O157 observed in the cattle
population (fecal,
intestinal mucosal swabs and skin
swab samples) as well as on the skins. Even though the
prevalence of E. coli O157: H7 was low, numerically we
observed a gradual decline of the prevalence from the
fecal (2%), skin (0.9%) and carcass samples (0.5%) at the
processing plants demonstrating that current sanitary
dressing procedures are effective against E. coli O157:
H7.
It can also indicate good sanitary procedures
observed at the processing plants and the retail shops.
Our results are lower compared to previous studies con-
ducted in Ethiopia. For instance E. coli O157: H7 was re-
ported in 8% of beef samples collected at abattoirs and
retail shops [12], in 2.7% of beef carcass swab samples
collected from a slaughter house [25], and in 2.1% of
beef carcass and cutting board swab samples collected
from retailer shops [26]. Carcass contamination by feces
can occur directly from the intestinal content during
evisceration, or indirectly from skins during dressing op-
eration or from the abattoir environment such as from
contact with conveyer belts. Lack of detection of E. coli
O157:H7 in the environmental samples could be attrib-
uted to the low overall prevalence of this pathogen in
the present study and the small number of environmen-
tal samples (n = 62).

E. coli O157: H7 was not detected in the stool samples
from people with diarrhea seeking health services. Stud-
ies reporting E. coli O157: H7 in humans are limited in
Ethiopia despite the common occurrence of diarrhea
problems especially in children. One study [11] con-
ducted in children (n = 422) under five years of age with
acute diarrhea reported 14% prevalence of E. coli O157:
H7. Since our sample size (70 cases) was not sufficient,
compared to the aforementioned study (422 cases), to
draw conclusive evidence we recommend a more popu-
lation based study. The human clinical E. coli O157: H7
isolates (n = 59) in the above study [11] exhibited resist-
ance, at varying degrees, to all of the antimicrobials
tested with the highest resistance (90%) to ampicillin.
Among the E. coli O157: H7 isolates from beef cattle,
skins and carcass samples, even though antimicrobial re-
sistance was rare, all the isolates were resistant to ampi-
cillin. Similarly, Taye et al. [25] reported 100% resistance
to Ampicillin and Amoxicillin. The high prevalence of
resistance to the beta-lactam class of antimicrobials both
in the clinical and animal origin E. coli O157: H7 isolates

requires further investigation. Even though it is impos-
sible to draw epidemiologic association between the ob-
served high resistance to the beta-lactam classes of
antimicrobials and the frequency (quantity) of use of
these antimicrobials in this study, we speculate that
beta-lactams could be the most commonly used antimi-
crobials both in humans and cattle in Ethiopia. This
hypothesis needs to be further elucidated since deter-
mining the amount of antibiotic use both in humans and
animals is critical to assess the contribution of antibiotic
use to the level of AMR observed in a given country.

Conclusion
E. coli O157: H7 was identified at low prevalence from
the feces, intestinal mucosal swab and skin swab samples
collected from cattle slaughtered at processing plants.
Isolation of E. coli O157: H7 from the fecal samples and
intestinal mucosal swabs indicates carriage of the patho-
gen by the animal. Although the prevalence of E. coli
O157: H7 is low, its public health impact should not be
underestimated given its low infective dose. The present
study showed that the prevalence of E. coli O157: H7 in
beef cattle production setting is low; current sanitary
processing procedures at the processing plants; and good
carcass handling at the retail shops are effective against
E. coli O157: H7. Further large scale epidemiological
studies in the beef cattle production and processing con-
tinuum are recommended to further substantiate our
present findings.
