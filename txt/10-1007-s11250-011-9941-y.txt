Abstract A study was undertaken from October 2006 to
March 2007 to determine the prevalence and antimicrobial
resistance patterns of Salmonella serovars. Liver, mesenter-
ic lymph nodes,
intestinal content, and carcass swab
samples (each n=186) were collected from 186 apparently
healthy slaughtered cattle at Bahir Dar abattoir. Bacterio-
logical analysis was done according to the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO 6579 2002). Isolates
were serotyped at Agence Française de Securite Sanitaire
des Aliments, Cedex, France. Twenty-eight isolates con-
sisting of Salmonella Typhimurium, Salmonella Newport,
Salmonella Haifa, Salmonella Heidelberg, Salmonella
Infantis, and Salmonella Mishmarhaemek were identified.
Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Newport were
most frequently isolated while Salmonella Heidelberg and
Salmonella Mishmarhaemek were isolated least. Eleven of
the 28 (39.3%) were resistant
to one or more of the
antimicrobials tested. Resistance was shown to ampicillin,
chloramphenicol, gentamycin, norfloxacin, polymyxin-B,
streptomycin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim. Four of 11

Introduction

Salmonellosis is the leading most common foodborne
zoonoses (Acha and Szyfres 2001; Maddox 2003) caused
by organisms of the genus Salmonella (Radostits et al.
2007). Non-typhoidal Salmonella represents an important
human and animal pathogen worldwide (Hoelzer et al.
2011). Infection in animals is of importance because of the
direct economic effect. Of even greater importance is that
animals constitute a vast reservoir of these organisms for
human infection (Libby et al. 2004). In humans, in addition
to concern about foodborne zoonoses caused by Salmonella
organisms, concern has also been raised about the impact of
acquired antimicrobial resistance transferred among these
organisms (Dargatz et al. 2003) which limits therapeutic

options both in veterinary and public health practice. Most
human salmonellosis cases are foodborne (Hoelzer et al.
2011). Dahshan et al. (2011) indicated chance of transmis-
sion of antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella to humans
through the food chain and a threat to human health in
their study of emergence of multidrug-resistant Salmonella
Stanley from cattle diagnostic specimens in southern Japan.
In Ethiopia, Beyene et al. (2011) detected multiply drug-
resistant Salmonella organisms in their study on etiology of
febrile and diarrheic illness in Ethiopian children focusing
on Salmonella. Multidrug-resistant Salmonella Concord
infections was isolated in Europe and the USA in children
adopted from Ethiopia (Hendriksen et al. 2009).

However, it is often very difficult to predict when and
why a Salmonella serovar will decline or rise in impor-
tance, either as a result of natural causes or control
measures, which indicates the need for continuous attention
concerning the distribution and importance of Salmonella
serovars involved. In Ethiopia, Salmonella serovars have
been reported from slaughtered cattle and cattle products
(Nyeleti et al. 2000; Alemayehu et al. 2003; Sibhat et al.
2009). Beyene et al. (2011) reported different Salmonella
isolates from febrile and diarrhoeic children. According to
Mache (2002), Salmonella was one of the major causes of
diarrhea in humans.

This together with tradition of raw meat consumption
and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials signifies the
importance of salmonellosis in the country. Therefore, this
study was designed to find out diversity and antimicrobial
resistance patterns of Salmonella serovars isolated from
apparently healthy slaughtered cattle at Bahir Dar munic-
ipality abattoir, north-west Ethiopia.

Materials and methods

Study animals and sampling

This cross-sectional study was conducted on 186 apparently
healthy adult male cattle that have finished their traction life
and slaughtered between October 2006 and March 2007 at
Bahir Dar municipality abattoir. Study animals were
indigenous zebu cattle kept
in extensive management
system originating from west Gojam and South Gondar
Zones of Amhara National Regional State; and some of
them were kept for 24 h to 15 days at Bahir Dar before
being presented to the abattoir for slaughter. They were kept
in open-air during the day and in barns during the night and
fed hay and water by their respective owners until they
were presented for slaughter. There was also an opportunity
for some animals to be bought and presented to the abattoir
for slaughter on the same day. Animals were kept without
feed and water in holding pens for an average of 7 h after

they were presented to the abattoir. Animals were eviscer-
ated in the same room where they were stunned, there was a
separate building for managing and storing of hides. Except
the inspection activity, a separate group each containing two
slaughter men was assigned to carry out all the slaughtering
process of one animal from stunning to evisceration,
managing all the visceral organs and finally to loading. In
the slaughter house, there was tap water which was not
warmed. The wall of the slaughter house was rough while
the floor was smooth which had drainage at the center. A
knife was used to handle the slaughtering process of one or
more animals. There was no significant washing of the
hands and among the slaughtering processes. Loading was
based on manual means.

On each sampling day, study animals were selected
randomly by using the identification numbers given to the
animals both for antemortem and postmortem examination;
then liver tissue, mesenteric lymph nodes, intestinal content
and carcass swab samples were aseptically collected in
sterile containers. Carcass swab samples were collected by
rubbing the carcass using sterile cotton swabs moistened in
10-ml buffered peptone water (BPW; AES, Cedex, France)
at the end of slaughtering process. Samples were stored at
4°C for not more than 12 h until they are processed in Bahir
Dar Regional Veterinary Laboratory.

Isolation and identification of Salmonella

Isolation and identification was made based on the
recommendations of the ISO method for the detection of
Salmonella from food and animal feeding stuffs (ISO 6579
2002). Twenty-five grams from each of lymph node and
liver were minced into fine pieces and placed in a separate
stomacher bag containing 225-ml BPW and homogenized
using stomacher. Carcass swab and intestinal content
samples were homogenized by shaking manually. After all
homogenized samples were incubated at 37°C for about
16 h, a portion of the culture (0.1 ml) was transferred to a
tube of selective enrichment liquid media containing 10 ml
of a Rappaport–Vassiliadis with soya broth (Titan Biotech,
Raj, India) and 1 ml to a tube containing 10 ml of Muller–
Kauffmann tetrathionate novobiocin broth (Oxoid, Hamp-
shire, England) and incubated at 42°C for 24±3 h and at
37°C for 24±3 h, respectively. A loopful of inoculum from
each of enrichment cultures were inoculated on the surface
of two different plates containing xylose lysine deoxycho-
late (XLD) agar (AES laboratoire, Cedex, France) and
MacConkey agar and were incubated at 37°C for 24±3 h.
For confirmation, five presumptive Salmonella colonies
both from XLD agar and MacConkey agar were selected
and streaked onto the surface of pre-dried nutrient agar
(Oxoid, Hampshire, England) plates and incubated at 37°C
for 24±3 h. If there were less than five typical colonies on

one plate, all the typical or suspect colonies were used. Pure
cultures from the nutrient agar were used for biochemical
confirmation. Triple sugar
(Difco, Becton
Dickinson, Claix, France), lysine iron agar (Difco™, Becton
Dickinson, Claix, France), urea agar (BBL®, Becton Dick-
inson, USA) and Simons’s citrate agar (Difco, Detroit, USA)
were inoculated and incubated at 37°C for 24±3 h. Biochem-
ical confirmation of Salmonella organisms were made
according to Quinn et al. (1999).

Serotyping Biochemically confirmed isolates were cultured
on brain heart
infusion agar (Difco, Becton Dickinson,
Claix, France) and shipped to Agence Française de Securite
Sanitaire des Aliments, Maisons-Alfort, Cedex, France for
serotyping.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Each isolate was
susceptibility to eight
commonly used antimicrobials using the disk diffusion
method according to guidelines set by the National
Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS
1997). Five milliliter tryptic soy broth (Oxoid, England)
was inoculated and incubated at 35°C for 4 h. Culture of
each isolate was compared with 0.5 McFarland turbidity
standards (if necessary adjusted by adding sterile saline
into tubes). Muller Hinton agar plates (Difco, Becton
Dickinson, Claix, France) were inoculated by swabs
immersed in each of
room
temperature for 30 min to allow drying. Antimicrobial
impregnated discs were dispensed on the surface of
cultures of Muller Hinton agar and incubated at 37°C for
20 h. The diameters of the zones of inhibition were
recorded to the nearest millimeter and classified as
resistant, intermediate, or susceptible according to pub-
lished interpretive chart (NCCLS 1997). Tested antimicro-
bials, their concentration in the discs and their zone of
inhibition in deciding susceptibility are given in Table 1.

Results

The prevalence of Salmonella at animal and sample level
was observed. At animal level, overall prevalence of 7%
(13 of 186) was bacteriologically positive for Salmonella
(Table 2). At sample level, Salmonella was observed with
prevalence of 3.8% (28 of 744). Salmonella was detected
from liver, mesenteric lymph nodes, carcass swab, and
intestinal content samples (each n=186) with prevalence of
1.1%, 3.2%, 4.8%, and 5.9%, respectively. Six different
serovars of Salmonella and four untypable (rough strains)
were isolated (Table 2). Salmonella Typhimurium and

Salmonella Newport were isolated at the highest frequency;
Salmonella Heidelberg and Salmonella Mishmarhaemek
were isolated at frequency of 7.1% (2 of 28) of the total
isolates.

More than one isolate was detected in 11 of the animals
which were positive for Salmonella. All the six Salmonella
serovars were detected both from mesenteric lymph node,
intestinal content, and carcass swab samples except
Salmonella Mishmarhaemek and Salmonella Heidelberg,
which were not detected from samples of mesenteric lymph
nodes (Table 2).

Antimicrobial resistance profiles

Of the 28 isolates, 39.3% were resistant to streptomycin.
All isolates were susceptible to the antimicrobial effects of
gentamycin, norfloxacin, and trimethoprim. Antimicrobial
resistance was detected in 11 of the 28 isolates (39.3%), of
which four of 28 (14.3%) were multiple antimicrobial
resistant
in isolates from the
mesenteric lymph nodes while seven of 28 (25%) were
resistant
to a single antimicrobial agent. The highest
number of resistant isolates was detected from intestinal
contents (Table 3).

(MAR) and was higher

Discussion

The highest sample prevalence (5.9%) was found on
intestinal content followed by carcss (4.8%). The preva-
lence of Salmonella from carcasses was in agreement with
(2003) who reported
the work of Alemayehu et al.
prevalence of 3.1% and 2.8% from muscles of
the
diaphragm and the abdomen, respectively. Fegan et al.
(2004) also reported carcass contamination of 2% from an
abattoir in Australia. In any case, carcass contamination
levels have to be taken with caution; as the presence of
even a single carrier animal can be a potential source of
contamination of the carcasses, environment or personnel.
Salmonella serovars including Salmonella Typhimurium,
Salmonella Newport, Salmonella Infantis, Salmonella Haifa,
Salmonella Heidelberg, and Salmonella Mishmarhaemek
were detected. Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella
Newport were the most frequently isolated serovars, each
accounting for 21.4% of the total isolates. The frequency of
isolation of Salmonella Typhimurium was consistent with the
report of Alemayehu et al. (2003) and Fegan et al. (2004)
who found Salmonella Typhimurium as being the dominant
serovar among their
isolates. Salmonella Infantis and
Salmonella Mishmarhaemek were detected with prevalences
of 17.9% and 7.1%, respectively. Salmonella Heidelberg was
detected with prevalence equal
to that of Salmonella
Mishmarhaemek.

Salmonella Typhimurium was the second dominantly
isolated serovar in a study on etiology of febrile and
diarrheic illness in Ethiopian children focusing on Salmo-
nella (Beyene et al. 2011), and Zewdu (2004) isolated
Salmonella Newport from stool sample. Therefore, detec-
tion of these two serovars at the highest prevalence indicate
public health concern in the study area as these organisms
may reach to the consumer along the production chain,
which become more serious in Bahir Dar in particular and
in Ethiopia in general as the tradition of consuming raw or
undercooked meat is common. Salmonella Heidelberg was
previously isolated from camels (Molla et al. 2004) and
sheep (Molla et al. 2006). As to the authors’ knowledge,
Salmonella Heidelberg was not isolated from cattle and
Salmonella Haifa was not previously reported in Ethiopia;
therefore, the detection of these two serovars from cattle in

the current study indicates change in distribution to
different population (the case of Salmonella Heidelberg)
and importance (the case of Salmonella Haifa) of Salmo-
nella serovars. The similarities of serovars between the
different sample types might be associated with potential
contamination during the slaughtering process either from
the animals themselves, from the slaughterhouse personnel
or from other common sources. According to Bouchrif et
al. (2009), the leading source of contamination of carcasses
by Salmonella is the evisceration step at the slaughterhouse.

Antimicrobial resistance patterns

In the current study, 11 (39.3%) isolates were resistant to
one or more of the tested antimicrobials. Four of the 28
(14.3%) isolates were MAR which was lower than the

reports of Molla et al. (2006) and Aragaw et al. (2007) in
Ethiopia. The difference in the prevalence of multiple
antimicrobial
resistance Salmonella isolates might be
associated with the difference in the use of antimicrobials
both in human and public health in the different study areas.
In Addis Ababa and central Ethiopia, drugs were easily
available without prescription and indiscriminate use of
antimicrobials were common (Molla et al. 2006). In Japan,
Ishihara et al. (2009) reported that antimicrobial-resistant
Salmonella have been isolated from poultry, swine, and
cattle and present a growing concern to the public health.
Four types of antimicrobial resistance patterns including
Str, StrTet, AmpStrTet, and ChlStrTet were detected among
the different serovars. In consistent with Sibhat et al.
(2009), the highest level of resistance (66.7%) was seen in
Salmonella Newport
to streptomycin. All serovars of
Salmonella Heidelberg and Salmonella Haifa were resistant
to streptomycin. Two isolates of Salmonella Haifa were
resistant
to ampicillin, streptomycin, and tetracycline.
Previously, MAR up to ten antimicrobials of Salmonella
Typhimurium was reported (Molla et al. 2006; Aragaw et
al. 2007). The differences in the level of resistance of the
isolated serovars from previous studies might be associated
with differences in the frequency and type of antimicrobials
used in the study areas. Alexander et al. (2009) described
that increased frequency of antimicrobial-resistant Salmo-
nella isolated from humans has led to concern about the

contribution animal production systems have played in the
emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant Salmonel-
la. Antimicrobial resistance is a global problem in general
(Acha and Szyfres 2001), but it might be more severe in
Ethiopia where there is lack of antimicrobial resistance
assessments of Salmonella and lack of stringent regulations
but there is easy access of antimicrobials for purchase of
people without prescription and incomplete treatment
courses as the result of patient noncompliance.

In summary, six different Salmonella serovars including
Salmonella Typhimurium, Salmonella Newport, Salmonella
Infantis, Salmonella Haifa, Salmonella Heidelberg, and
Salmonella Mishmarhaemek were detected, and all tested
isolates were susceptible to the antimicrobial effects of
gentamycin, norfloxacin, and trimethoprim. Antimicrobial
resistance was observed mainly to streptomycin followed
by tetracycline and ampicillin. Both single and multiple
antimicrobial resistance patterns were observed, which is of
special concern in Ethiopia where use of antimicrobials has
problems. In animals, there is treatment restriction because
of inadequate drug alternatives; therefore, limited drugs are
frequently used for treatment. In humans, there are drug
alternatives. However, people have easy access to various
antimicrobials and can purchase without prescription, and
incomplete treatment courses due to patient noncompliance
are common practices. Results of this study suggest the
need to maintain hygiene during slaughtering operations at

the slaughterhouse and consumer awareness on proper
cooking of meat and meat products before consumption and
antimicrobial resistance. Further detailed studies involving
different abattoirs, animal products, food items, and animals
on different settings were recommended in the study area.
