Abstract 
Introduction:  This  study  investigated  the  antimicrobial  resistance  and  clonality  of  Salmonella  enterica  serotype  Kentucky  in  poultry  and 
poultry sources in Nigeria, and compared the isolates with the clone of S. Kentucky STI98-X1 CIPR using (PFGE) and (MIC).  
Methodology: Fecal samples from chickens and poultry sources (litter, water, rodent and lizard fecal samples) were collected from  fourteen 
(14) poultry farms in 2007, 2010 and 2011 and were analyzed for S. Kentucky. 
Results  and  conclusions:  Six  percent  of  the  samples  were  positive  for  S.  Kentucky  –  all  resistant  to  nalidixic  acid  and  ciprofloxacin.  The 
isolates are grouped within the PFGE cluster X1 of S. Kentucky STI98 CIPR, indicating the association to the emerging and widely spread 
CIPR S. Kentucky clone with poultry and poultry sources.

Introduction 

Salmonella  enterica 

(S. 
Kentucky)  has  been  closely  associated  with  poultry 
since  it  was  first  isolated  in  1937  from  a  chick  in  the 
United States of America (USA) [1].

During  the  1990s,  a  clone  of  ciprofloxacin-
resistant  (CIPR)  S.  Kentucky  (MIC  >  0.06µg/mL 
according  to  EUCAST)  of  multilocus  sequence  type 
(MLST)

featuring  high-level  resistance  to  fluoroquinolones. 
Recently,  the  clone  has  spread  to  several  countries, 
including  sub-Saharan  Africa,  the  Middle  East,  and 
Europe, causing infection in humans probably through 
contaminated 
secondary 
contaminations [2].

Methodology 

Fecal  and  environmental  samples  were  collected 
from  poultry  houses 
(Ibadan)  and 
northeastern  (Maiduguri)  regions  of  Nigeria  in  the 
years 2007 and 2010 to 2011, respectively.

In  Ibadan,  a  total  of  641  samples  from  chickens 
were  collected  between  March  and  May  2007  from 
nine  different  intensively  managed  farms,  while  in 
Maiduguri,  five  intensively  managed  poultry  farms

feces)  were  collected.  Salmonella  were

characterization  according  to  the  standard  techniques 
recommended  [4].  Full  serotyping  was  carried  out  on 
all  the  presumptive  isolates  at  the  WHO  reference 
laboratory  in Thailand.  MIC  determination  and  PFGE 
were  performed  according  to  Hendriksen  et  al.  [5]. 
The PFGE patterns were subsequently compared using 
Bionumeric  software  with  the  clone  of  S.  Kentucky 
STI98-X1  CIPR  [2].  The  antimicrobials  and  resistance 
cut-off  values  (μg/mL)  were:  AMP,  ampicillin  (>  8); 
AUG,  amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid  (≥  32);  APR, 
apramycin  (>  32);  XNL,  ceftiofur  (>  2);  CHL, 
chloramphenicol  (>  16);  CIP,  ciprofloxacin  (0.064-1; 
>  1);  COL,  colistin  (>  2);  FFN,  florfenicol  (>  16); 
GEN,  gentamicin  (>  2);  FOT,  cefotaxime  (>  0.5); 
NAL,  nalidixic  acid  (>  16);  NEO,  neomycin  (>  4); 
SPE, spectinomycin (> 64); STR, streptomycin (> 16); 
SMX, sulfamethoxazole (> 256); TET, tetracycline (> 
8);  TMP,  trimethoprim  (>  2).  The  MIC  test  was 
carried  out  on  the  isolates  using  a  commercially 
prepared,  dehydrated  panel 
(Sensititre;  TREK 
Diagnostic Systems Ltd., East Grinstead, England). 
 
Results 

Out  of  an  overall  911  samples  analyzed,  55  (6%) 
were positive for S. Kentucky (44 and 11 isolates from 
Ibadan and Maiduguri respectively) . Forty-five of the 
isolates  were  from  chicken  fecal  samples,  while  the 
remaining  were  distributed  among  samples  from 
lizards  (n  =  3),  water  (n  =  1),  rodents  (n  =  5),  and 
poultry house (litter ; n = 1), as shown in Figure 1. 

resistant 

Generally, all the isolates from the two geographic 
to  nalidixic  acid  and 
regions  were 
ciprofloxacin  (MIC  >  4  µg/mL);  a  full  antibiogram  is 
presented  in  Figure  1.  In  comparison  to  S.  Kentucky 
from Maiduguri, the isolates from Ibadan exhibited the 
highest  level  of  resistance,  where  isolate  KS  13  from 
farm  B  conferred  resistance  to  nine  of  all  tested 
antimicrobials 
including  ampicillin,  ciprofloxacin, 
gentamicin,  nalidixic  acid,  neomycin,  spectomycin, 
streptomycin,  sulfamethoxazole,  and  tetracycline.  In 
addition,  28  isolates  originating  from  nine  different 
farms  exhibited  a  similar  resistance  pattern,  as  KS  13 
(excluding  neomycin)  conferred  resistance  to  eight 
antimicrobials  (Figure  1).  Eleven  isolates  from  four 
farms  in  Ibadan  and  11  isolates  from  five  poultry 
farms in Maiduguri shared the same resistance profile: 
ciprofloxacin,  gentamicin,  nalidixic  acid,  neomycin, 

spectomycin,  streptomycin,  sulfamethoxazole,  and 
tetracycline. 

None  of  the  isolates  were  resistant  to  cefotaxime 
(FOT)  and  ceftiofur  (XNL),  indicating  the  absence  of 
extended-spectrum cephalosporinases.  

 
The  55  isolates  were  separated  into  four  overall 
PFGE  clades  which  consisted  of  36,  17,  1,  and  1 
isolates,  respectively  (Figure  1).  Among  the  two 
largest  clades,  seven  clusters  of  indistinguishable 
PFGE  patterns  were  observed.  The  largest  cluster 
consisted  of  23  isolates  from  Ibadan  (2007)  and  all 
isolates  from  Maiduguri  (2010-2011)  except  for  one. 
The  isolates  from  Ibadan  were  all  from  chickens 
sampled  from  nine  farms,  whereas  the  isolates  from 
Maiduguri  all  were  from  poultry  feces  and  poultry 
environment  of  five 
intensively  managed  farms. 
Additionally,

cluster  X1  of  S.  Kentucky  STI98  CIPR  (data  not 
shown) [2]. 
 
Discussion 

This  study  investigated  the  presence  of  CIPR  S. 
Kentucky  isolates  from  poultry  and  poultry  sources 
over time from two regions in Nigeria.  

We  observed  diversity  based  on  PFGE,  indicating 
the presence of several lineages in Nigeria. Despite the 
diversity,  all  samples  still  fell  within  the  PFGE  X1 
strain, affirming  their long-term presence in the  study 
region [2].

Beyond quinolone resistance, additional resistance 
to 
gentamicin, 
sulfamethoxazole,  and  tetracycline  were  observed  in 
some  CIPR  S.  Kentucky  isolates,  which  points  to  the 
presence  of  SGI  (9,  10,  11);  further  studies  are 
required  to  confirm  this  speculation.  The  lack  of 
effective 
policy 
of 
fluoroquinolones, 
ciprofloxacin, 
enrofloxacin,  and  ofloxacin,  in  chicken  production  in 
Nigeria  (unpublished  data)  may  have  contributed  to 
the dissemination of multidrug-resistant non-typhoidal 
Salmonella;  rapid  spread  has  also  been  observed  in 
Southeast  Asia  [2].  The  emergence  and  spread  of 
clinically  significant  clonal  groups  of  Salmonella 
appear to occur on a regular basis [9].

This study documented  a significant contamination of 
poultry  with  multidrug-resistant  S.  Kentucky,  which 
reaffirmed  the initial speculation  of the existence of a 
prevailing  circulating  poultry-associated  STI98-X1 
CIPR S. Kentucky in Africa, including Nigeria [2]. We 
speculate that one or more traits must be present in this 
serovar  that  underlie  its  success  as  colonizer  of 
chickens;  perhaps  among 
those 
facilitating  specific  host–bacterial  interactions  and 
those 
farm 
environments  [10,11].  Further  studies  will  be  needed 
to confirm these hypotheses.

The  extent  of  the  emergence  of  the  ST198-X1 
CIPR  S.  Kentucky  clone  in  the  poultry  sector  in 
different  regions  of  Africa  remains  to  be  determined, 
but  this  preliminary  investigation  has  revealed  that 
poultry in Nigeria, where the industry uses indigenous 
domestic fowl, are largely contaminated with a single 
strain  as  defined  by  PFGE.  This  did  not  corroborate 
the  hypothesis  that  the  dissemination  of  a  common 
contaminated poultry lineage throughout Africa might 
be  responsible  for  the  dissemination  of  this  clone. 
More  likely,  it  is  contaminated  food  ingredients, 
including  human  food  [12],  that  serve  as  a  portal  of 
entry into the agriculture production systems [13].

It  is  recommended  that  the  authorities  in  Nigeria 
establish  a  National  Salmonella  Surveillance  Program 
for effective long-term national and international joint 
integrated public health surveillance with  surveillance
