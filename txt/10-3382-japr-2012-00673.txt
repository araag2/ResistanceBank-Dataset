  SUMMARY 

  The objectives of the current study were to detect virulence factors and determine antimi-
crobial susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus by using 360 fresh raw chicken meats, col-
lected from 133 chicken shops in Isfahan, Iran, from January 2011 to March 2012. The Staph. 
aureus isolates were identified using culture and phenotypical methods. The PCR assays were 
developed with specific primers for the detection of different virulence and antibiotic resistance 
genes of Staph. aureus. The agar disk diffusion method was used for evaluation of antibiotic 
susceptibility of Staph. aureus isolated from chicken meat samples. In this survey, 101 out of 
360 samples were positive for Staphylococcus (28.05%). In our results indicated, out of 360 
samples, 82 (22.77%) were positive for Staph. aureus and, out of 82 positive samples, 96.34% 
had X-region, 76.92% had fibrinogen clumping factor A, 63.41% had staphylococcal coagulase 
virulence genes, 26.82% had IgG binding region, and the toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 gene 
was not isolated in any sample. The methicillin was the highest (82.92%), whereas macrolides 
was the lowest (34.14%) antibiotic-resistant genes in Staph. aureus-positive samples. Tetracy-
cline had the highest resistant profile (97.56%) in Staph. aureus isolates, followed by methi-
cillin (75.6), sulfamethoxazol (31.7%), trimethoprim (31.7%), streptomycin (31.7%), genta-
micin (29.26%), enrofloxacin (28.04%), ampicillin (26.82%), chloramphenicol (20.73%), and 
cephalothin (17.07%). Statistical analysis showed significant differences between presences of 
various virulence and antibiotic resistance genes in Staph. aureus isolated from chicken meat 
samples. It seems that inspection of chicken meat using multiplex PCR is a useful technique for 
detection of Staph. aureus virulence and antibiotic resistance genes.

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM

Staphylococcus  aureus  is  a  facultative  an-
aerobic  gram-positive  coccal  bacterium  that 
can easily contaminate meat, food, and the en-
vironment [1, 2]. Staphylococcus aureus causes 
severe animal diseases such as mastitis, suppu-
rative disease, arthritis, and urinary tract infec-
tions [3, 4]. In humans, this bacterium is a major 
cause of food poisoning, pneumonia, postopera-
tive wound infections, and nosocomial bactere-
mia [1]. The onset of symptoms in staphylococ-
cal food poisoning is usually rapid and in many 
cases  acute,  depending  on  individual  suscepti-
bility to the toxin, the amount of contaminated 
food eaten, the amount of toxin in the food in-
gested, and the general health of the victim. The 
most common symptoms are nausea, vomiting, 
retching, abdominal cramping, and prostration. 
Some individuals may not always demonstrate 
all the symptoms associated with the illness. In 
more  severe  cases,  headache,  muscle  cramp-
ing,  and  transient  changes  in  blood  pressure 
and  pulse  rate  may  occur.  Recovery  generally 
takes 2 d; however, it is not unusual for com-
plete recovery to take 3 d and sometimes longer 
in severe cases. Food spoilage caused by Staph. 
aureus is more important in children and the el-
derly. Death from staphylococcal food poison-
ing  is  very  rare,  although  such  cases  have  oc-
curred among the elderly, infants, and severely 
debilitated persons [5].

In most cases of disease due to Staph. aureus, 
virulence genes have a major role. This bacte-
rium can cause a disease that is associated with 
the presence of various virulence genes. In many 
cases of disease due to Staph. aureus, proteins 
with  affinity  to  fibronectin  (fnbA),  fibrinogen 
(i.e., clumping factors A and B, encoded by the 
clfA and clfB genes, respectively), sialoprotein 
(bbp),  collagen  (cna),  adhesins  with  unknown 
function  (sdrC  and  sdrE),  and  elastin  (ebpS) 
have  been  isolated  [6–12].  Bacterial  proteins 
with superantigen activity including toxic shock 
syndrome  toxin-1  (TSST-1,  encoded  by  tst), 
enterotoxins A  to  E,  G  to  R,  and  U  (encoded 
by  the  genes  sea–see, seg–ser,  and seu),  exfo-
liative toxins A and B (eta and etb), and other 
toxins,  such  as  a-,  b-,  c-,  and  d-toxin  and  the 
Panton–Valentine leukocidin (pvl), have a role 
in causing disease [13–15]. The X-region gene 

of Staph. aureus has a high degree of importance 
in  causing  diseases,  and  it  may  have  a  varia-
tion rate (or clock speed) that provides suitable 
discrimination  for  outbreak  investigation  [16]. 
The IgG binding region is responsible for caus-
ing host specificity and various immunological 
responses  against  Staph.  aureus  [17,  18].  The 
X-region  and  IgG  binding  region  of  virulence 
genes have been isolated from various types of 
Staph. aureus infections [19–24].

The rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance in 
Staph. aureus is a global concern. Results from 
a study demonstrated that the Staph. aureus has 
multiple  resistances  to  different  antimicrobial 
agents [25]. Antibiotic resistance depends on the 
presence of genes, which encode the antibiotic 
resistance. Another study reported the rapid ap-
pearance of penicillin and methicillin resistance 
in  Staphylococcus  spp.  [26].  Other  investiga-
tions showed that Staph. aureus has multidrug 
resistance,  such  as  resistance  to  aminoglyco-
sides, macrolides, lincosamides, streptogramins, 
and tetracyclines [27, 28]. The possible transfer 
of Staph. aureus genes encoding antibiotic resis-
tance has been reported from humans and other 
animals [29].

This bacterium prevents phagocytosis, indi-
rect cell immunity [30], and produces enzymes 
that  limit  the  effectiveness  of  penicillin  treat-
ment  [31].  The  antibiotic-resistant  genes,  in-
cluding mecA (methicillin), aacA-D (aminogly-
cosides), tetK, tetM (tetracyclines), ermA, ermB, 
ermC  (macrolide–  lincosamide–streptogramin 
B), msrA (macrolides), and linA (lincosamides), 
have  been  reported  in  last  decade  among  the 
isolates of Staph. aureus [27, 32]. Among these 
antimicrobial  resistance  genes,  mecA  encodes 
PBP2a, aacA-D encodes a bifunctional enzyme 
[28],  msr  causes  resistance  to  macrolides  and 
streptogramin  B,  which  effects  efflux  pump 
activity  [28,  33],  as  well  as  tetK,  tetM,  which 
modify tetracycline efflux activity and ribosome 
function, respectively [28].

Staphylococcus  aureus  has  been  tested  in 
meat  and  poultry  products  to  assess  the  mi-
crobiological  and  storage  quality  of  products. 
It is necessary to know which endemic strains 
of  Staph.  aureus  in  chicken  meat  samples  are 
highly  pathogenic  and  antibiotic  resistant,  but 
no previous data exists for the Isfahan province 
of Iran. Therefore, the present study was carried

out for detection of virulence factors and anti-
microbial resistance properties of Staph. aureus 
isolated from chicken meat in the Isfahan prov-
ince of Iran.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Samples and Identification of Staph. aureus

In  this  study,  which  took  place  from  Janu-
ary 2011 to March 2012, a total of 360 chicken 
shops  were  studied  randomly  from  522  total 
chicken shops in Isfahan province. One chicken 
meat sample was taken from each shop; there-
fore, 360 chicken meat samples were collected. 
Each chicken shop was dedicated solely to the 
sale of chicken. All of the chicken meats sam-
pled  in  the  Isfahan  province  were  apparently 
healthy and were immediately transferred to the 
laboratory in cool packs.

Twenty-five  grams  of  chest  muscle  were 
weighed into sterile stomacher bags and diluted 
with 225 mL of sterile Butterfield’s phosphate 
buffered  dilution  water. All  samples  were  ho-
mogenized in a stomacher for about 1 min. Ten 
milliliters  of  homogenized  Butterfield’s  phos-
phate  buffered  dilution  water  was  inoculated 
into tryptic soy broth [34] with 10% NaCl and 
incubated at 37°C for 18 h. One loopful of the 
tryptic soy broth was streaked on Baired-Parker 
agar [35], supplemented with egg yolk-tellurite 
emulsion [36], and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. 
Typical  colonies  of  Staph.  aureus  were  isolat-
ed  from  each  plate  and  cultured  separately  on 
brain-heart infusion agar [37].

The identification was carried out using Gram 
staining, production of coagulase, and fermenta-
tion of mannitol. The strains were further identi-
fied as Staph. aureus by PCR amplification of 
the 23S rDNA according Straub et al. [38].

DNA Extraction

Isolates were grown on blood agar [39] for 24 
h, then a single colony was picked, resuspended 
in 100 mL of sterile deionized water, and heat-
ed at 99°C for 15 min with mild shaking in a 
Thermomixer comfort [40]. The tubes were then 
centrifuged at  1,000  × g  for  5  min  at  14°C  to 
remove the sediment and supernatant containing 
crude extract of bacterial DNA was transferred 
into a new tube and frozen until used for PCR 
amplification.

PCR for Detection of Virulence  
Genes in Staph. aureus

For PCR amplification, the reaction mixture 
(30 μL) contained 1 μL of primer F (10 pmol/
μL),  1  μL  of  primer  R  (10  pmol/μL),  0.6  μL 
of  deoxynucleoside  triphosphate  (10  mmol/L) 
[41],  3  μL  of  10×  PCR  buffer  [42],  1.8  μL  of 
MgCl2 (25 mmol/ L) [43], 0.1 μL of Taq DNA 
polymerase (5 U/μL) [44], and 20 μL of distilled 
water. Finally, 2.5 μL of DNA preparation was 
added to each 0.2-mL reaction tube. The tubes 
were subjected to thermal cycling [45] with the 
program shown in Table 1.

The  PCR  amplification  was  performed  for 
the  genes  encoding  staphylococcal  coagulase 
(coa),  clumping  factor  (clfA),  IgG  binding  re-
gion,  TSST-1  (tst),  ETA  (eta),  and  ETB  (etb). 
The presence of PCR products was determined 
by electrophoresis of 12 μL of the reaction prod-
uct in a 2% agarose gel with trisacetate electro-
phoresis buffer (0.04 mol of Tris/L, 1 mmol of 
EDTA/L; pH 8) and a 100-bp DNA ladder [51] 
as a molecular marker [52].

PCR for Detection of Antibiotic  
Resistance Genes of Staph. aureus

All oligonucleotide primers used in this study 
were selected from earlier reports, as mentioned 
in  Table  2.  The  presence  of  the  mecA,  aacA-
D, tet K, tet M, msrA, and msrB genes encod-
ing methicillin, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, 
and macrolides resistance was examined using 
multiplex PCR assay introduced by Kumar et al. 
[28].

Antibiotic Susceptibility Test

Antimicrobial  susceptibility  tests  were  per-
formed by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion meth-
od using Mueller-Hinton agar [53] according to 
the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 
guidelines. All  Staph.  aureus  isolates  were  in-
vestigated for their antimicrobial resistance by 
the  agar  disk  diffusion  test  using  the  antibiot-
ics  ampicillin,  chloramphenicol,  enrofloxacin, 
gentamicin, 
tetracycline, 
streptomycin,  trimethoprim,  cephalothin,  and 
methicilin. After incubating the inoculated plate 
aerobically at 35°C for 18 to 24 h in an aero-
bic atmosphere, the susceptibility of the Staph.

aureus isolates to each antimicrobial agent was 
measured  and  the  results  were  interpreted  in 
accordance  with  interpretive  criteria  provided 
by NCCLS [54]. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 
25923 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 were 
used as control strains of this test.
Statistical Analysis

Data  were  transferred  to  a  Microsoft  Excel 
spreadsheet  [55]  for  analysis.  Using  the  SPSS 
18.0  statistical  software  [56],  Chi-squared  test 
analyses were performed, and differences were 
considered significant at values of P < 0.05.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

From a total of 360 chicken shops studied, the 
chickens of 101 shops were found to be contam-

inated  with  staphylococcal  bacteria  (28.05%). 
Among  the  101  staphylococcal  isolates  from 
chicken  meat  samples,  82  were  identified  as 
Staph. aureus (81.18%) according to the results 
of phenotypical assays. These strains were con-
firmed by PCR amplification of the 23s rDNA 
specific to Staph. aureus. Therefore, out of 360 
specimens collected, 82 Staph. aureus (22.77%) 
isolates were identified.

After PCR, it was recognized that from a total 
82 Staph. aureus isolates, 79 samples (96.34%) 
had the X-region and 63 samples (76.82%) had 
the  clfA  virulence  genes.  The  presence  of  the 
IgG  binding  region  (26.82%),  etA  (30.48%), 
and  etB  (30.48%)  had  lower  frequency  (Table 
3).  The  tst  gene  was  not  found  among  the  82 
positive samples. This study is the first preva-

in chicken meat samples.

The presences of antibiotic resistance genes 
were detected by single-step PCR (Table 4). A 
total of 68 of the 82 positive samples (82.92%) 
had the mecA resistance gene, whereas 28 sam-
ples (34.14%) had the msrA gene (Table 4). The 
mecA  gene  had  the  highest  frequency  of  anti-
biotic resistance genes. The msrA had the low-
est  frequency  of  antibiotic  resistance  genes  in 
Staph. aureus isolated from chicken meat in the 
Isfahan province of Iran.

Antimicrobial  resistance  profiles  in  Staph. 
aureus isolated from chicken meats in the Isfa-
han province of Iran showed that Staph. aureus 
strains  had  the  highest  antibiotic  resistance  to 
tetracycline  (97.56%),  followed  by  methicilin 
(75.60%),  sulfamethoxazol  (31.70%),  trime-
thoprim (31.70%), and streptomycin (31.70%). 
The  Staph.  aureus  isolates  had  the  lowest  an-
tibiotic resistance to cephalothin (17.07%) and 
chloramphenicol  (20.73%;  Table  5).  In  the 
current  study,  multiple  resistances  were  found 
in  Staph.  aureus  isolated  from  chicken  meats 
(Table 6). All isolates were resistant to an antibi-
otic, but only 10.96% of isolates were resistant 
to more than 3 antibiotics.

Seasonal  patterns  were  observed  for  the 
prevalence of this bacterium from January 2011

to  March  2012  (Table  7).  The  chicken  meat 
samples  collected  in  summer  had  the  highest 
and samples collected in winter had the lowest 
prevalence of Staph. aureus, respectively (Table 
7). The high prevalence of Staph. aureus in sum-
mer season showed that this bacterium needs a 
proper  temperature  (warm  weather)  to  survive 
and  contaminate  chicken  meats.  The  relative 
temperature during summer in this area of Iran 
was 40°C on average, whereas average tempera-
tures were 15, 6, and 19°C in autumn, winter, 
and spring, respectively. Significant differences 
(P < 0.05) were observed between the summer 
and winter levels of chicken meat contamination 
with Staph. aureus and also (P < 0.05) between 
the relative temperature of the summer and win-
ter seasons.

Prescription of tetracycline, methicilin, strep-
tomycin, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazol is 
not currently effective for treatment of cases of 
Staph.  aureus  in  the  Isfahan  province  of  Iran. 
Cephalothin  and  chloramphenicol  are  the  best 
antibiotics for treatment of Staph. aureus.

The high presence of Staph. aureus in chick-
en meat samples (22.77%) in our study was in

agreement with previous investigations [57, 58]. 
Only 2 studies have been done on detection of 
Staph.  aureus  in  poultry  meat  samples  in  Iran 
[59, 60] that are in agreement with our results. 
Javadi and Safarmashaei [60] reported that 65% 
of poultry meat samples were positive for pres-
ence of Staph. aureus, which was lower than our 
results (81.18%).

Based  on  the  results  of  the  present  study, 
consumption  of  these  infected  chicken  meat 
samples can cause gastrointestinal illness. Ben-
nett et al. [61] estimated that 1,200 deaths occur 
yearly  due  to  staphylococcal  food  poisoning. 
Therefore, it is important to investigate the pres-
ence of this bacterium in food samples. Chicken 
meat is a common food among the Iranian peo-
ple, and this study will help to raise the health 
awareness of people about the consumption of 
chicken meat.

Staphyloccocal  infections  are  usually  asso-
ciated with the presence of virulence genes. A 
study  in  Abidjan,  Côte  d’Ivoire,  showed  that, 
from a total of 34 strains of Staph. aureus iso-
lates, 70.6% had the mecA gene, 67.7% had the 
lukS gene, and the eta, etb and tst genes coding 
for  exfoliatine  and  TSST-1  were  less  frequent 
[62], which was in contrast with our results. The 
genes mecA (82.92%) and tetk (52.43%) had the 
highest prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes 
in our study. The Staph. aureus isolates of our 
study  had  the  highest  antibiotic  resistance  to 
methicillin (75.6%) and tetracycline (97.56%). 
The methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA) 
was  previously  isolated  from  9.6%  of  pork, 
5.6% of beef, and 1.2% of chicken samples [63], 
which was in agreement with our results.

In  one  study  of  143  Staph.  aureus  isolates 
from pork and chicken meat, seg, sei, sem, and 
sen  were  the  most  frequently  virulence  genes 
(53 isolates, 37%) [64], whereas our results indi-
cated that X-region, clfA, and coa were the most 
frequently  detected  virulence  genes  (96.34, 
76.82, and 63.41%, respectively). Fessler et al. 
[65]  reported  that  25%  of  fresh  chicken  meat,

21.1% of chicken meat products, 50% of fresh 
turkey  meat,  and  52.4%  of  turkey  meat  prod-
ucts displayed signs of MRSA. The presences of 
mecA, msrA, msrB, aacA-D, tetK, and tetM an-
tibiotic resistance genes and coa, clfA, X-region, 
IgG binding region, tst, etA, and etB virulence 
genes have been frequently reported from mas-
titic milk samples [66–68]. The present study is 
the first report of direct detection of coa, clfA, 
X-region, IgG binding region, tst, etA, and etB 
virulence genes in chicken meat samples. In our 
study,  resistance  to  tetracycline  and  methicilin 
was 97.56 and 75.6%, respectively, which is in 
agreement  with  previous  studies  [60,  63,  65]. 
All isolates of our study that had the IgG bind-
ing protein and all isolates with X-region factors 
were resistant to more than 3 antibiotics. There-
fore, these virulence factors may play an impor-
tant role in resistance of Staph. aureus isolates.
In  a  previous  study,  185  (92.5%)  out  of 
the  200  isolates  had  resistance  to  antibacterial 
agents, including penicillin G (82.0%), tetracy-
cline (19.0%), erythromycin (2.5%), clindamy-
cin  (2.0%),  trimethoprim  (7.5%),  kanamycin 
(2.5%),  streptomycin  (1.5%),  ciprofloxacin 
(1.5%),  fusidic  acid  (1.0%),  and  cadmium  ac-
etate (68.0%) [69]. In a study in Portugal, 38% 
of  the  Staph.  aureus  isolates  were  resistant  to 
oxacillin  (≥6  mg/mL;  MRSA  positives),  but 
only 0.68% showed the presence of mecA gene, 
whereas 70 and 73% of the Staph. aureus strains 
were resistant to β-lactams, ampicillin, and pen-
icillin, respectively [70]. It seems that our study 
is the first prevalence report of direct detection 
of  virulence  factors  and  antibiotic  resistance 
properties of Staph. aureus isolated from chick-
en meat in the Isfahan province of Iran.

In our study, chloramphenicol is a forbidden 
antibiotic drug. Our results showed that chlor-
amphenicol  had  a  low  resistance  percentage, 
because  of  its  infrequent  use.  Unfortunately, 
veterinarians in various fields, such as large ani-
mal internal medicine, poultry, and even aqua-
culture, use this antibiotic as a main drug. We 

MOMTAZ ET AL.: RAW CHICKEN BACTERIA 

919

suggest the use of florfenicol instead of chlor-
amphenicol, as florfenicol is not banned for use 
in farm animals and has no adverse effects such 
as those for chloramphenicol.

CONCLUSIONS AND APPLICATIONS
1.  Staphylococcus  aureus  can  easily  con-
 
taminate chicken meat and this contami-
nation is usually associated with a high 
presence of virulence and antibiotic re-
sistance genes.

2.  All strains of Staph. aureus isolated from 
chicken meat samples had resistance to 
more than one antibiotic drug. It seems 
that using raw chicken meat, processing 
with unsanitary methods, and a lack of 
proper hygiene practices by the poultry 
slaughterhouse staff are the main factors 
for contamination.

3.  The best methods for Staph. aureus pre-
vention  are  poultry  vaccination  against 
pathogen,  improving  methods  of  pro-
cessing, monthly monitoring of poultry 
slaughterhouses to detect Staph. aureus 
(especially  in  the  chicken  meat  and  on 
surfaces), fumigating poultry slaughter-
houses  frequently,  observing  hygiene 
during processing, complete cooking of 
chicken meat before consumption, keep-
ing chicken meat in a cool and dry place 
away  from  sunlight,  and  prevent  con-
tamination of chicken meats with extrin-
sic factors such as insects and dust.

4.  The  multiplex  PCR  assay  can  be  used 
as an accurate, safe, and fast technique 
for the detection of Staph. aureus and its 
virulence and antibiotic resistance genes 
in chicken meat samples.

5.  It  is  important  to  determine  the  impor-
tant  virulence  and  antibiotic  genes  and 
also  the  antibiotic  resistance  properties 
of  Staph.  aureus  isolated  from  chicken 
meat.  In  our  study,  the  X-region  viru-
lence  genes,  mecA  antibiotic  resistance 
genes, and resistance to tetracycline had 
the highest frequencies.

6.  Due to antibiotic resistance, especially in 
Staph. aureus, veterinarians should pay 
closer attention when prescribing antibi-
otics.
