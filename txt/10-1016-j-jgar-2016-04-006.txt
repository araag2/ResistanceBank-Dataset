isolates  recovered  from  healthy  broilers 

This  study  aimed  to  characterise  the  molecular  support  of  antibiotic  resistance  in  expanded-spectrum
in  Be´ jaı¨a,
cephalosporin  (ESC)-resistant  Escherichia  coli 
northeast  Algeria.  A  total  of  61  intestinal  swabs  from  slaughtered  broilers  from  four  regions  in  Be´ jaı¨a
locality,  Algeria,  were  collected  between  February  and  April  2014,  from  which  20  ESC-resistant  E.  coli
strains  were  isolated.  Escherichia  coli  isolates  were  identiﬁed  by  classical  biochemical  and  MALDI-TOF
methods.  Antibiotic  susceptibility  testing  was  performed  using  disk  diffusion  and  Etest  methods.
for  b-lactamases,  aminoglycoside-modifying  enzyme  (AME)-encoding  genes  and  qnr
Screening 
determinants  was  performed  by  PCR  and  sequencing.  Clonal  relatedness  was  determined  using
molecular  typing  by  multilocus  sequence  typing  (MLST).  Antibiotic  susceptibility  testing  revealed  that
the 
isolates  showed  high  rates  of  resistance  (>90%)  to  amoxicillin,  amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid,
piperacillin/tazobactam,  aztreonam,  ceftazidime,  streptomycin, 
tobramycin,  nalidixic  acid  and
ciproﬂoxacin.  Low  rates  of  resistance  were  observed  for  kanamycin  (35%),  amikacin  (30%),  cefoxitin
(20%)  and  cefotaxime  (15%).  Molecular  characterisation  revealed  that  all  of  the  isolates  expressed  the
blaTEM-1 gene.  Fourteen  of  them  harboured  the  blaSHV-12 gene,  two  harboured  the  blaCTX-M-1 gene  and  four
isolates  harboured  blaCMY-2.  Screening  for  AME-encoding  genes  demonstrated  that  all  isolates  contained
the  aadA  gene.  In  addition,  qnrA  was  detected  as  the  quinolone  resistance  determinant  in  13  isolates.
MLST  revealed  four  known  sequence  types  (STs),  including  ST744,  ST38,  ST1011  and  ST2179,  as  well  as
one  new  sequence  type  (ST5086).  Here  we  report  the  ﬁrst  study  describing  the  clonal  diversity  of
extended-spectrum  b-lactamase  (ESBL)-  and  plasmid  AmpC-producing  E.  coli  isolated  from  healthy
broilers  in  Algeria.

1.  Introduction

Escherichia  coli  is  a  common  commensal  of  the  intestinal  tract  of
animals  and  humans  but  is  also  an  important  human  pathogen  [1].
Currently,  several  studies  have  reported  many  cases  of  infection
caused  by  multidrug-resistant  E.  coli  in  humans  and  animals  [1].
Some  studies  have  raised  an  alarm  about  the  wide  presence  of

extended-spectrum  b-lactamases  (ESBLs)  in  bacteria  recovered
from  a  wide  diversity  of  animals  and  food  products  in  different
countries  [2].  This  resistance  has  been  observed 
in  strains
originating  from  different  animal  species,  but  is  signiﬁcantly
higher  in  strains  isolated  from  intensive  broiler  production  around
the  world  [3].  Thus,  it  is  well  established  that  antibiotic-resistant
bacteria  that  are  selected  in  chickens,  pigs  and  cattle  may  be
transmitted  to  the  human  intestine  via  the  food  chain  as  well  as  in
environmental  settings  [1].  The  role  of  pets  and  wild  animals  as
reservoirs  of  antibiotic  resistance  genes  has  been  also  documented
[4].  Resistant  bacteria  and  plasmids  bearing  resistance  genes  could

be  transferred  from  chicken  to  chicken  and  from  chicken  to
humans  [5].  This  raises  public  health  concerns  as  the  intestinal
microbiome  of  these  animals  might  serve  as  a  reservoir  for  ESBL/
AmpC-encoding  resistance  genes  capable  of  being  transmitted  to
humans  [5].  Transmission  via  the  food  chain  has  been  suggested,
but  transmission  resulting  from  close  contact  between  humans
and  animals  on  livestock  farms  is  also  plausible  [5].  This  suggests
that  contact  with  broilers  and/or  the  farm  environment  could  be  a
risk  factor  for  ESBL/AmpC  carriage  among  humans  [5].  Escherichia
coli  isolates  resistant  to  oxyimino-cephalosporins  owing  to  the
production  of  ESBLs  have  emerged  worldwide  and  a  number  of
different  ESBL  genes,  such  as  the  blaSHV,  blaTEM and  blaCTX-M,  have
been  identiﬁed  [1].  In  Algeria,  the  ﬁrst  report  of  the  presence  of
CTX-M-like  enzymes  in  clinical  Enterobacteriaceae  isolates  was
made  by  Touati  et  al.,  from  Be´ jaı¨a, northeast  Algeria  [6].  Detection
of  the  SHV-12  enzyme  was  reported  for  the  ﬁrst  time  in  clinical
isolates  in  Algeria  in  2008  by  Iabadene  et  al.  [7].  In  addition,  the
CMY-2  enzyme  was  reported  for  the  ﬁrst  time  in  a  Salmonella
enterica  serotype  Senftenberg  clinical  isolate  recovered  from  stools
of  an  Algerian  child  [8].  In  poultry,  one  study  on  ESBL-producing
E.  coli  from  avian  isolates  was  conducted  by  Meguenni  et  al.  [9].  The
authors  cited  the  presence  of  the  ESBL  enzymes  CTX-M-1  and
CTX-M-15  in  E.  coli  isolates  from  birds  in  the  Algerian  central
regions  [9].

The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  characterise  the  antibiotic
resistance  determinants 
in  expanded-spectrum  cephalosporin
(ESC)-resistant  E.  coli  isolates  recovered  from  healthy  broilers  in
Be´ jaı¨a,  Algeria.

2.  Materials  and  methods

2.1.  Sampling  and  strain  isolation

A  total  of  61 

intestinal  swabs  (inside  of  the  caecum)  of
slaughtered  broilers  were  collected  from  four  poultry  farms  in  four
regions  in  Be´ jaı¨a, Algeria  (30  from  the  Be´ jaı¨a region,  15  from  the
Akbou  region,  13  from  the  Feraoun  region  and  3  from  the  Souk
El-Te´ nine  region)  and  were  screened  for  the  presence  of  ESBL-
producing  E.  coli  isolates  between  February  and  April  2014.  Each
swab  was  incubated  for  24  h  at  37  8C  in  nutrient  broth  (Fluka,  St
Louis,  MO)  for  enrichment.  They  were  subsequently  seeded  on
eosin–methylene  blue  agar  (Fluka)  plates  supplemented  with
2  mg/mL  ceftazidime  and  were  incubated  for  24  h  at  37  8C.  Isolates
with  typical  E.  coli  morphology  were  selected  (one  per  sample)  and
were  identiﬁed  by  classical  biochemical  methods  using  the  API  20E
identiﬁcation  system  (bioMe´ rieux,  Marcy-l’E´ toile,  France)  and
were  conﬁrmed  using 
laser  desorption/
ionisation 
time-of-ﬂight  mass  spectrometry  (MALDI-TOF/MS)
method  (Microﬂex;  Bruker  Daltonics  GmbH,  Bremen,  Germany)
[10].

2.2.  Antibiotic  susceptibility  testing

(CA-SFM) 

Antibiotic  susceptibility  testing  was  performed  on  Mueller–
Hinton  (Fluka)  agar  by  the  standard  disk  diffusion  procedure  as
described  by  the  Antibiogram  Committee  of  the  French  Society  for
Microbiology 
(http://www.sfm-microbiologie.org/).
Eighteen  antibiotics  were  tested,  including  amoxicillin,  amoxicil-
lin/clavulanic  acid,  piperacillin/tazobactam,  cefoxitin,  cefotaxime,
ceftazidime,  cefepime,  aztreonam,  meropenem,  imipenem,  ami-
kacin,  tobramycin,  streptomycin,  kanamycin,  gentamicin,  nalidixic
acid,  ciproﬂoxacin  and  colistin 
from  Bio-Rad,  Marnes-
la-Coquette,  France).  Minimum  inhibitory  concentrations  (MICs)
of  cefotaxime,  ceftazidime,  cefepime  and  ciproﬂoxacin  were
determined  using  the  Etest  method  (AB  BIODISK,  Solna,  Sweden).
Results  were  interpreted  according  to  CA-SFM  breakpoints.

2.3.  Phenotypic  extended-spectrum  b-lactamase  detection

A  screening  test  for  ESBL  production  was  carried  out  on
Mueller–Hinton  agar  by  the  double-disk  synergy  test  by  placing
disks  of  aztreonam,  cefepime,  ceftazidime  and  cefotaxime  (30  mg
each)  at  a  distance  of  20  mm  centre-to-centre  from  a  disk  with
amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid 
the
inhibition  zone  between  the  disks  containing  amoxicillin/clavu-
lanic  acid  and  cefotaxime  or  ceftazidime  indicated  the  presence  of
ESBL  production  [11].

2.4.  Molecular  detection  of  antibiotic  resistance-encoding  genes

PCR  ampliﬁcation  of  blaCTX-M,  blaTEM,  blaSHV,  blaPER,  blaVEB,
blaGES,  blaCMY and  blaDHA genes  was  carried  out  by  PCR  as
previously  described  [12].  PCR  screening  was  also  performed  for
aminoglycoside-modifying  enzyme 
[aac(3)-Ia,
aac(60)-Ib,  aadA,  ant(200)-I  and  aph(30)-VI]  and  16S  rRNA  methylase
genes  (armA  and  rmtA–F)  as  previously  described  [13]. 
In
addition,  the  plasmid-mediated  quinolone  resistance-encoding
genes  qnr  and  aac(60)-Ib-cr  were  screened  as  previously  described
[14,15].

(AME)  genes 

All  positive  PCR  products  obtained  were  sequenced  using
BigDye1 terminator  chemistry  on  an  automated  ABI  3730
automated  sequencer  (Applied  Biosystems,  Foster  City,  CA).

2.5.  Multilocus  sequence  typing  (MLST)

MLST  was  performed  on  the  20  ESC-resistant  E.  coli  isolates
using  seven  housekeeping  genes  (adk,  fumC,  gyrB,  icd,  mdh,  purA
and  recA)  according  to  the  E.  coli  MLST  database  (http://mlst.
warwick.ac.uk/mlst/dbs/Ecoli).

3.  Results

3.1.  Bacterial  strains  and  antibiotic  susceptibility

Among  the  61  broilers  sampled,  20  ESC-resistant  E.  coli  isolates
were  selected  and  identiﬁed  by  API  20E  and  MALDI-TOF/MS.  Using
the  double-disk  synergy  test,  ESBL  production  was  conﬁrmed  in  16
of  the  20  ESC-resistant  E.  coli  isolates.

3.2.  Resistance  gene  determination

All  E.  coli  isolates  tested  contained  the  blaTEM-1 gene.  Among
them,  two  co-expressed  the  blaCTX-M-1 gene,  14  co-expressed  the
blaSHV-12 gene  and  4  co-expressed  blaCMY-2 (Table  1).  Screening
for  genes  encoding  AMEs  demonstrated  that  all  of  the  isolates
contained  the  adenylyltransferase  gene  aadA  (Table  1).  None  of
the  isolates  contained  either  the  aac(3)-Ia,  aac(60)-Ib,  aph(30)-VI,
ant(200)-I  or  16S  rRNA  methylase  genes.  In  addition,  13  of  the
isolates  tested  produced  the  qnrA-like  gene  (Table  1).  None  of
the  isolates  produced  the  variant  aac(60)-Ib-cr.

3.3.  Multilocus  sequence  typing  results

Five  different  sequence  types  (STs)  were  assigned  to  the  20  ESC-
resistant  E.  coli  strains  isolated  from  four  Be´ jaı¨a  localities,  including
four  known  STs  [ST744  (4  strains),  ST38  (1  strain),  ST1011
(12  strains)  and  ST2179  (1  strain)]  and  one  new  ST  (ST5086)  in  two
E.  coli  isolates  (Table  1;  Fig.  1).

4.  Discussion

Escherichia  coli  is  a  common  inhabitant  of  the  intestinal  tract  in
humans  and  animals  and  can  be  easily  disseminated  in  different
ecosystems  through  the  food  chain  and  via  water  [16].  Overuse  of
antibiotics  in  food-source  animal  production  has  been  shown  to
increase  the  risk  of  spread  of  antibiotic  resistance  [4].  ESBL-
producing  Enterobacteriaceae  have  been  detected  in  patients,
individuals  from  the  community,  meat, 
livestock,  companion
animals  and  the  environment.  Transmission  between  humans  and
animals  might  occur  through  the  food  chain  [17].  In  this  context,
our  study  was  conducted  to  investigate  the  occurrence  of  the  ESBL-
producing  E.  coli  in  slaughtered  broiler  intestines.  The  results  of
this  study  show  that  20  ESBL-positive  E.  coli  strains  were  isolated
from  intestinal  swabs  of  61  slaughtered  broilers  in  four  regions  in
Be´ jaı¨a, Algeria 
(Fig.  1).  The  SHV-1,  TEM-1  and  OXA-type
b-lactamases  have  been 
in  E.  coli  and
Salmonella  spp.  from  animals  and  food  of  animal  origin  in  Spain,
Germany,  the  USA  and  the  UK  [18].  In  Tunisia,  Ben  Slama  et  al.  have
reported  the  presence  of  CTX-M-1,  CTX-M-8,  CTX-M-14  and  TEM-1
in  food  samples  (poultry  and  other  animals)  [19].

frequently  described 

In  Algeria,  very  few  studies  have  been  conducted  to  characterise
antibiotic-resistant  strains  from  animals  and  food  of  animal  origin.
Among  them,  one  study  on  ESBL-producing  avian  E.  coli  was
conducted  by  Meguenni  et  al.  [9].  In  that  study,  the  authors
reported  the  presence  of  CTX-M-1-  and  CTX-M-15-producing
E.  coli  in  Algerian  central  regions  [9].  Hence,  the  originality  of  the
present  study  is  the  detection,  in  addition  to  CTX-M-1,  of  the
presence  of  SHV-12  associated  with  the  TEM-1  b-lactamase  from
for  consumption  after
E.  coli 
slaughtering.  The  TEM-1  detected 
in  all  of  the  strains  was
associated  with  SHV-12  from  the  Feraoun  and  Souk  El-Te´ nine

cities,  or  with  CTX-M-1  from  the  Akbou  and  Feraoun  cities,  or  with
CMY-2  from  Be´ jaı¨a  City  (Table  1).  Dissemination  and  persistence  of
CMY-2-encoding  plasmids  are  evident,  and  this  might  have  also
been  contributed  by  the  geographical  transfer  of  the  CMY-2
isolates  through  international  trade  in  food  animals  [20].  In  2006,
Blanc  et  al.  reported  the  presence  of  CMY-2-encoding  plasmids  in
E.  coli  from  poultry,  pig  and  rabbit  farms  in  Spain  [21].  In  Algeria,
this  b-lactamase  has  only  been  detected  from  isolates  recovered  in
the  clinical  setting  [22].  CMY-2  was  detected  in  four  isolates  of
E.  coli  recovered  from  Be´ jaı¨a City.

in  ESBL-producing  Enterobacteriaceae 

Co-resistance  to  non-b-lactam  antibiotics  such  as  aminoglyco-
sides 
is  commonly  de-
scribed  [20].  In  addition,  the  presence  of  ESBL  and  plasmid  AmpC
(pAmpC)  genes  associated  with  AME  genes  has  been  reported  in
other  studies  [16,19].

Resistance  to  aminoglycosides  is  generally  mediated  by  AMEs,
including  aminoglycoside  phosphotransferases,  acetyltransferases
and  nucleotidyltransferases,  and  16S  rRNA  methylases  have  been
reported  recently  among  Enterobacteriaceae,  Pseudomonas  spp.
and  Acinetobacter  spp.  [23].  In  the  current  study,  the  acetyltrans-
ferase  aadA  gene  was  identiﬁed  in  all  strains.  None  of  the  isolates
contained  either  the  aac(3)-Ia,  aac(60)-Ib,  aph(30)-VI,  ant(200)-I  or
16S  rRNA  methylase  genes.  The  aadA  gene  was  detected,  associated
with  CTX-M-14a,  CTX-M-32  or  TEM  52,  from  E.  coli  in  poultry  by
Costa  et  al.  in  their  prevalence  study  of  ESBL-producing  E.  coli
isolates  in  faecal  samples  from  broilers  [24].  Plasmid-mediated
quinolone  resistance  was  ﬁrst  identiﬁed  in  a  clinical  isolate  of
Klebsiella  pneumoniae.  Recently,  a  new  mechanism  of  quinolone
resistance  has  been  identiﬁed:  transfer  from  species  to  species  of  a
plasmid  encoding  aac(60)-Ib-cr,  a  variant  of  aminoglycoside
acetyltransferase  that  confers  reduced  susceptibility  to  ciproﬂox-
acin  and  norﬂoxacin  by  N-acetylation  of  the  amino  nitrogen  on  its
piperazinyl  substituent.  Genes  responsible  for  plasmid-mediated
quinolone  resistance  are  thought  to  be  linked  to  ESBL  genes  [25].
The  aac(60)-Ib-cr  gene  was  detected  from  E.  coli  in  poultry  by
Agabou  et  al.  in  their  study  [1].  In  the  current  study,  in  addition  to
ESBLs,  13  isolates  producing  CTX-M-1  or  SHV-12  were  found  to
carry  a  qnrA-like  gene,  from  Feraoun  locality.  To  our  knowledge,
the  qnrA  gene  has  not  yet  been  reported  in  Algeria.  In  China,  Xie
et  al.  reported  the  presence  of  the  qnrA  gene  in  E.  coli  recovered

pathogenic  bacteria  but  also  in  the  endogenous  ﬂora  of  exposed
individuals  (animals  and  humans)  or  populations  [37].

The  study  of  antibiotic  resistance  in  strains  of  animal  origin  in
Algeria  has  been  focused  on  cases  of  illness  caused  by  E.  coli
[27,28].  The  STs  identiﬁed  in  the  current  study  were  ST744  (from
Be´ jaı¨a  locality),  ST38  (from  Akbou  locality),  ST1011  and  ST2179
(from  Feraoun  locality)  and  a  new  ST5086  (from  Souk  El-Te´ nine
locality)  (Fig.  1).  Hasan  et  al.  isolated  CTX-M-1-  and  CTX-M-15-
producing  E.  coli  ST744  from  domestic  chicken  in  Bangladesh  [29].
Then,  ST744  with  CTX-M-1  was  reported  by  Guenther  et  al.  in  a
bird  of  prey  E.  coli  in  Germany  [30].  ST38  was  also  reported  by  Vogt
et  al.  in  meat-packing  plants  in  Switzerland  [31],  and  recently  by  Al
Bayssari  et  al.  in  an  E.  coli  OXA-48-producer  in  fowl  from  Lebanon
[32].  ST2179  was  detected  in  CTX-M-8-producing  E.  coli  in  buffalo
[33]  and  in  CTX-M-15-producing  E.  coli  in  horses  from  Brazil  [34].
ST744,  ST38  and  ST2179  have  been  identiﬁed  in  clinical  isolates  in
three  hospitals  in  Hangzhou,  China  [35].  Escherichia  coli  ST1011
should  be  evaluated  further  for  its  zoonotic  potential.  It  was
detected 
in  human  extraintestinal  pathogens  from  Brazil  by
Maluta  et  al. 
In  the  present  study,  ST1011  was  the
predominant  ST  because  it  was  found  in  12  strains  (60%)  isolated
from  the  Feraoun  locality.  Interestingly,  in  addition  to  the  four
known  STs  obtained  in  this  study,  we  have  detected  a  new  ST
(ST5086).  It  was  detected  in  two  TEM-1-  and  SHV-12-producing  E.
coli  strains  isolated  from  Souk  El-Te´ nine  locality.

Antibiotic  usage 

is  considered  the  most 

important  factor
promoting  the  emergence,  selection  and  dissemination  of  antibi-
otic-resistant  micro-organisms  both  in  veterinary  and  human
medicine.  Antibiotic  usage  selects  for  resistance  not  only 
in

Several  studies  have  shown  that  antimicrobial  use  in  food
animals  contributes  to  the  selection  of  antimicrobial  resistance
and  poses  risks  to  humans  because  of  transmission  of  resistant
zoonotic  bacteria  via  the  food  chain  and  by  indirect  transfer  of
resistance  genes  from  animals  to  man  [38].  At  slaughter,  resistant
strains  from  the  gut  readily  soil  poultry  carcasses  and  as  a  result
poultry  meats  are  often  contaminated  with  multiresistant  E.  coli;
likewise,  eggs  become  contaminated  during 
laying.  Hence,
resistant  faecal  E.  coli  from  poultry  can 
infect  humans  both
directly  and  via  food.  These  resistant  bacteria  may  colonise  the
human  intestinal  tract  and  may  also  contribute  resistance  genes  to
human  endogenous  ﬂora  [37].

Currently,  when  a  severe  clinical  infection  due  to  a  multidrug-
resistant  pathogen  appears,  it  is  treated  with  colistin  [39].  In
animals,  colistin  is  used  to  prevent  or  treat  infections  caused  by
E.  coli  isolates.  In  addition,  this  antibiotic  is  administered  with  food
during  or  post  weaning  of  animals  [40].  Colistin-resistant  bacteria
in  animals  have  been  identiﬁed  in  many  countries.  Recently,  the
emergence  of  plasmid-mediated  colistin  resistance  involving  the
mcr-1  gene  from  bacteria  was  reported  in  many  countries  [41].  In
Algeria,  colistin-resistant  E.  coli  isolates  with  the  associated  mcr-1
gene  were  isolated  from  poultry.  This  is  worrying  because  colistin
is  used  as  a  last  resort  to  treat  multidrug-resistant  pathogenic
infections  [41].

Finally,  we  conclude  that  broilers  can  be  a  reservoir  of  ESBL-  and
pAmpC-producing  bacteria.  These  can  be  transmitted  by  direct
contact  or  by  the  food  chain.  Surveillance  of  antibiotic  resistance  in

commensal  bacteria  from  food-producing  animals  is  considered  to
be  one  of  the  main  priorities.
