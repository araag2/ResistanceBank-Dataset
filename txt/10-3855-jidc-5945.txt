Abstract 
Introduction: Salmonella is one of the major foodborne pathogens responsible for outbreaks of foodborne illness in humans worldwide. 
Methodology:  A  total  of  560  samples  of  chicken  meat  and  giblets  were  collected  from  retail  markets  for  Salmonella  identification, 
serotyping, and antimicrobial resistance testing. 
Results: Salmonella was detected in 19.8% of samples. Among the five serotypes identified, S. Thompson was the predominant type (48.7%). 
High  antimicrobial  resistance rates  were  observed  to  nalidixic acid  (92.8%), tetracycline  (81%), trimethoprim  (68.4%),  sulfamethoxazole  / 
trimethoprim  (61.2%),  streptomycin  (56.7%),  and  kanamycin  (36.9%).  Although  resistance  to  chloramphenicol  (3.6%),  amoxicillin-
clavulanic  acid  (5.4%),  and  ampicillin  (11.7%)  was  detected,  none  of  the  isolates  were  resistant  to  ceftazidime,  ceftriaxone,  cefotaxime, 
ciprofloxacin, colistin, gentamicin, nor imipenem. 
Conclusions: Restrictions on the irrational use of antibiotics in humans and animals are suggested for the reduction of resistant strains.

Introduction 
Salmonella 

promotes  the  development  of  antimicrobial-resistant 
bacteria,  potentially  worldwide  [10].  The  prevalence 
of  Salmonella  serotypes  and 
their  antimicrobial 
resistance  in  chicken  meat  and  giblets  have  been 
reported in many investigations around the world [11-
20]. Despite considerable of progress in human public 
health,  Salmonella 
significant 
foodborne  pathogen  in  the  food  chain.  Based  on  the 
importance  of  this  pathogen  in  human  public  health, 
this study was carried out to determine the prevalence 
and  antimicrobial  resistance  of  Salmonella  strains 
isolated from retail chicken meat and giblets in Alborz 
Province, Iran.

is  one  of 

the  major  foodborne 
pathogens  worldwide  [1,2]  and  is  responsible  for 
outbreaks  of  foodborne  illness  in  humans  via  cross-
contamination and consumption of undercooked meats 
[3,4]. It has been estimated that Salmonella has caused 
approximately  one  million  cases  of  foodborne  illness 
and  378  deaths  per  year  in  the  United  States  [5]. 
Salmonella  spp.  is  also  the  most  commonly  reported 
cause of foodborne outbreaks (39.2%) in the European 
Union  (EU),  with  2,201  outbreaks  in  2007,  of  which 
142  occurred 
in  France  [6].  High  percentages 
(approximately  70%–80%)  of  foodborne  bacterial 
outbreaks  in  China  were  caused  by  Salmonella  [7]. 
Although  other  food  products,  such  as  eggs  and  red 
meats,  can  be  contaminated  with  Salmonella  spp., 
poultry products have been recognized to be the main 
source of this pathogen in humans [8]. Contamination 
of poultry meat can occur at different stages, including 
production,  slaughter,  processing,  handling,  and 
storage  [9].  Antimicrobial  agents  are  widely  use  in 
veterinary  medicine,  not  only  for  prevention  and 
treatment  of  diseases,  but  also  as  growth-promoting 
substances. However, the widespread use of antibiotics 

 

Methodology 

A total of 560 samples of retail chicken meat (200) 
and giblets, which included liver (120), gizzard (120), 
and heart (120), were purchased from retail markets in 
Alborz  Province  between  October  2013  and  March 
2014.  All  samples  were 
transferred  under  cold 
conditions  (using  icepacks)  to  the  laboratory  for 
microbial  examination.  For  Salmonella  identification, 
25g  of  each  meat  sample  was  homogenized  for  2 
minutes  with  225  mL  of  buffered  peptone  water

(Merck,  Darmstadt,  Germany)  and  then  incubated  for 
24  hours  at  37°C.  After  incubation,  0.1  mL  of  the 
broth  was  transferred  into  10  mL  of  selenite  cystine 
broth (Merck) and incubated at 42°C for 24 hours. The 
enrichment  samples  were  then  subcultured  on  to 
Salmonella-Shigella agar and brilliant green agar (both 
Merck)  and 
incubated  for  24  hours  at  37°C. 
Presumptive  Salmonella  isolates  were  identified  by 
using triple sugar iron agar, lysine iron agar, and urea 
agar (all Merck) at 37°C. 

 

Serotyping 

Salmonella  isolates  were  further  serotyped  by 
direct  agglutination  method  using  antisera  against  O 
and H antigens (BioRad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France) 
and the Kauffman-White classification schema [21].

The  antimicrobial  susceptibility  of  Salmonella 
isolates  was  determined  by  the  disk  diffusion  method 
on  Mueller-Hinton  agar  (Britania,  Buenos  Aires, 
Argentina),  performed  according  to  the  Clinical  and 
Laboratory  Standards  Institute  guidelines  [22].  The

After  incubation  at  35°C  for  24  hours,  the  zone  of 
inhibition  around  each  disk  was  measured  and 
evaluated  according  to  the  Clinical  and  Laboratory 
Standards  Institute  guidelines  [22].  Escherichia  coli

Results and Discussion 

Of  560  examined  samples,  111  (19.8%)  were 
contaminated with Salmonella spp. Table 1 shows the 
prevalence of Salmonella spp. isolated from examined 
samples. The incidence of  Salmonella spp. in  chicken 
products  obtained  by  other  authors  varied  between  0 
and 100% [23,24]. In this study, the overall prevalence 
of Salmonella in chicken meat and giblets was 19.8% 
(111/560).The  contamination  rate  of  chicken  meat 
samples (29%) is in agreement with results reported in 
Belgium 
the  United  Kingdom  [26],  Iran 
[27],China  [28],  Turkey  [29],  Iraq  [30],  and  the 
Russian  Federation  [31],  but  lower  than  results  found 
in  Iran  [20,32]  and  many  other  countries,  such  as 
China,  Mexico,  and  Poland 
[16,18,33-35].  The 

[25], 

process, 

found 

in 

the  present 

which  may 

incidence of Salmonella spp. was found to be 21.6% in 
chicken  liver  samples,  14.1%  in  heart  samples,  and 
8.3%  in  gizzard  samples.  In  a  previous  study  in  Iran, 
the  incidence  of  Salmonella  spp.  contamination  in 
chicken liver, heart, and gizzard was found to be 18%, 
6%, and 4%, respectively [36], which  was lower than 
that 
study.  However, 
contamination  levels  higher  than  those  in  this  study 
were  reported  from  Egypt  and  Ethiopia  at  incidence 
rates of 40% and 48%, respectively, in chicken livers, 
and  34.5%  and  23.7%,  respectively,  in  chicken  hearts 
[37,11].  The  reasons  for  the  higher  incidence  of 
Salmonella  contamination  in  chicken  meat  than  in 
giblets  in  the  present  study  can  be  due  to  the 
defeathering 
spread 
microorganisms  between  carcasses  [37].  All  previous 
studies showed that Salmonella was widely distributed 
in  retail  meat  globally,  which  increased  salmonellosis 
following consumption of contaminated meat or cross-
contamination in households. This risk may be higher 
if  chicken  meat  or  giblets  are  consumed  undercooked 
[38,25].  Data  on  the  prevalence  of  Salmonella  in 
different studies were difficult to compare because the 
observed  prevalence  may  be  biased  by  diversity  in 
sampling  methods,  sampling  seasons,  and  techniques 
the 
[28].  However,  variations  observed  between 
reported 
previous 
investigations around the world may be due to several 
factors, including the initial salmonellosis in live birds, 
sanitation  within 
slaughterhouse,  possible 
contamination  during  poultry  processing  steps  (e.g., 
the  amount  of  cross-contamination  of  chicken 
carcasses  by  contact  with  intestinal  tracts  during 
slaughter  or  processing),  and  differences  among 
isolation  methods  applied  to  detect  Salmonella  [36]. 
Among  the  111  positive  isolates  found  in  the  present 
study,  five  different  serotypes  (S.  Thompson,  S. 
Enteritidis,  S.  Typhimurium,  S.  Newport,  and  S. 
Hadar)  were  completely  identified  in  107  samples.  S. 
Thompson  (48.7%)  was  the  serotype  most  frequently 
detected,  followed  by  S.  Enteritidis  (22.5%),  S. 
Typhimurium  (12.6%),  S.  Newport  (7.2%),  and  S. 
Hadar 
(3.6%)  were  not 
completely serotyped (Table 2). S. Thompson was the 
predominant serotype in uncooked chicken and beef in 
Tehran.  It  is  one  of  the  most  important  Salmonella 
serotypes  that  can  cause  outbreaks  and  infection  in 
poultry  [32].  In  the  United  States,  the  Centers  for 
Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC)  has  reported 
that  S.  Enteritidis,  S.  Typhimurium,  and  S.  Newport 
are  the  most  prevalent  serotypes  reported  by  public 
health laboratories [39].

All these serotypes are common isolates from chicken 
meat.  Salmonella  serotypes  detected  in  this  study  are 
in  agreement  with  CDC  report.  Previous  studies  have 
reported  some  of  the  serotypes  that  were  identified  in

humans  and  animals  [2].  Antimicrobial  resistance  in 
Salmonella serotypes has been a global problem, with 
rates  increasing  from  between  20%  and  30%  in  the 
early 1990s to as high as 70% in some countries at the 
[43,44].  The

In  this  study,  high  antimicrobial  resistance  rates 
were found against nalidixic acid (92.8%), tetracycline 
(81%), 
/ 
trimethoprim  (61.2%),  streptomycin  (56.7%),  and 
kanamycin (36.9%). As in the present study, resistance 
to  the  above  antibiotics  have  also  been  frequently 
reported in a number of other investigations on poultry 
products 
[12,18-
20,28,32,36,45-48]. The Salmonella resistance rates to 
nalidixic acid (92.8%) and tetracycline (81%) found in 
this  study  were  higher  than  resistance  rates  to  other 
antimicrobials  because  of 
these 
antimicrobials  for  treatment  and  growth  promotion  in 
different  fields.  These  findings  are  comparable  with 
those 
(nalidixic  acid,  90.6%; 
tetracycline,  71.6%)  [20],  but  higher  than  those 
reported in Turkey (nalidixic acid, 62.5%; tetracycline, 
6.2%) 
(nalidixic  acid,  47%; 
tetracycline,  50%)  [28].  Also, 
low  antimicrobial 
resistance  rates  were  observed  in  the  present  study  to 
chloramphenicol  (3.6%),  amoxicillin-clavulanicacid 
(5.4%),  and  ampicillin  (11.7%);  these  rates  were 
slightly higher than those found by Soltan Dallal et al. 
[32].  Although  a  few  Salmonella  isolates  showed 
resistance  to  chloramphenicol,  amoxicillin-clavulanic 
acid,  and  ampicillin,  the  isolates  were  still  largely 
these  antimicrobials.  Luckily,  no 
susceptible 
to 
isolates  were 
identified 
to 
ceftazidime,  ceftriaxone,  cephotaxime,  ciprofloxacin, 
colistin,  gentamicin,  and 
imipenem.  This  maybe 
explained  by  the  limited  availability  and  high  cost  of 
these  antimicrobials,  which  would  decrease  their 
frequent  utilization  in  veterinary  or  public  health 
practices  in  Iran.  These  antimicrobials  can  be  used 
effectively  to  treat  Salmonella  infections.  Despite 
increasing  resistance  to  commonly  used  antibiotics  in 
animal  and  human  medicine  globally,  the  numbers  of 
multidrug-resistant  Salmonella  isolates  continues  to 
increase  [2,11].  The  percentage  of  multidrug-resistant 
Salmonella  strains  observed  in  this  study  (62.2%)  is 
higher than that reported in Italy (2.3%) [49] and Iran 
(23.5%)  [20],  although  lower  than  that  found  in 
Morocco  (75.43%)  [17],  Portugal  (75%)  [50],  Turkey 
(100%)  [13,16,29],  Spain  (100%)  [2],  Brazil  (100%) 
[51], Nepal (100%) [52], the United States (92%) [53], 

that  were 

resistant 

Mexico  (85.4%)  [34],  and  China  (80%)  [54].  In  the 
present  study,  all  S.  Hadar  isolates  showed  multidrug 
resistance to nalidixic acid and tetracycline (Table 4). 

These  findings  confirm  that  in  Iran,  poultry  is  a 
major reservoir of multidrug-resistant Salmonella, and 
suggest  that  it  is  difficult  to  achieve  successful 
antimicrobial therapy for human  salmonellosis caused 
by strains of poultry origin. Resistance to two or more 
antibiotics  was  found  in  26  isolates  of  S.  Thompson, 
followed by 17, 8, 8, 6, and 4 isolates of S. Enteritdis, 
S.  Typhimurium,  S.  Newport,  S.  Hadar,  and  not 
completely  serotyped  serotypes,  respectively  (Table 
4).  The  high  prevalence  of  antimicrobial  resistance 
identified in the present study can be explained by the 
widespread  use  of  common  antimicrobials  as 
prophylactics,  growth  promoter  agents,  or 
in 
veterinary medicine. Furthermore, unlimited access  to 
these agents without a prescription as well as low rates 
of  antibiotic  sensitivity  tests  for  the  selection  of 
suitable drugs in Iran may be additional reasons for the 
high level of resistance. 

 

Conclusions 

Increasingly 

these  strains 

antibiotic-resistant 

The  results  of  this  study  suggest  that  improving 
sanitation  in  poultry  slaughterhouses  could  decrease 
Salmonella  contamination  and,  as  a  result,  human 
disease. 
strains 
constitute a public health hazard through transmission 
of 
to  humans  via  food  products. 
Therefore,  conducting  antibiotic  sensitivity  tests  and 
establishing  a 
for 
identification  of  resistance  prevalence  in  food  is 
necessary to reduce the spread of resistant strains.
