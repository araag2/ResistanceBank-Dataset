Background: Routine non-therapeutic antimicrobial use and overcrowding in animal farming 
may facilitate the propagation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This 
study  aimed  to  examine  the  carriage  prevalence  and  phenotype–genotype  characteristics  of 
MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolated from pigs.
Methods: Nasal swabs were collected from 1,458 pigs in 9 pig farms and 3 slaughterhouses. 
All strains were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, resistance genes, and virulence genes, 
and characterized by multilocus sequence typing. The correspondence analysis was conducted 
to explore the relationships between multiple phenotypic and molecular characteristics of S. 
aureus isolates.
Results: In the 1,458 pigs, the carriage prevalence was 9.5% for S. aureus, 3.3% for MRSA, 
and 9.3% for multidrug-resistant S. aureus. Notably, 97.1% S. aureus isolates were multidrug 
resistant, and the predominant resistance pattern was non-susceptible to clindamycin, tetracycline, 
and erythromycin. The predominant genotype was CC9 (ST9) for S. aureus and MRSA isolates. 
Importantly, all S. aureus isolates were negative for the scn gene and resistant to tetracycline. 
Notably, all 9 linezolid-resistant isolates were classified as multidrug resistance, including 1 
expressing the cfr gene and 6 expressing the optrA gene. The correspondence analysis showed 
a significant relationship between clonal complexes and resistance pattern or virulence genes. 
For example, CC9 was associated with extensive drug-resistance and co-carrying chp, sak, and 
hlb, and CC1 was associated with multidrug resistance and co-carrying sak and hlb.
Conclusion:  The  significant  correspondence  relationship  between  multiple  characteristics 
provides some implication for vaccine strategies and new ideas for monitoring new epidemio-
logic clones.

Introduction
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important cause of noso-
comial infections worldwide.1 Human-related MRSA is usually divided into 2 types 
according to epidemiological and molecular characteristics, including community-
associated and hospital-associated MRSA. However, latest evidence has revealed that 
the epidemiological trend has changed with the increasing appearance of livestock-

associated MRSA (LA-MRSA). In Asia, the most common 
lineage of LA-MRSA is ST9; while in Europe and North 
America, ST398 isolates are most prevalent.2 Notably, there is 
increasing emergence of outbreaks of LA-MRSA in hospitals 
and invasive LA-MRSA infections in humans.3 Therefore, 
LA-MRSA has become an important public health issue that 
warrants close monitoring.

More and more evidence revealed that non-therapeutic 
antimicrobial use and overcrowding in animal farming may 
facilitate  the  spread  of  LA-MRSA.4,5 Additionally,  recent 
reports found that LA-MRSA could colonize in multiple ani-
mals and related workers.2,6–9 Notably, MRSA epidemiology 
in livestock is increasing and the resulting food products may 
become contaminated through the MRSA-positive livestock, 
polluted  environment,  and  related  workers.10–12  Foodstuffs 
contaminated by MRSA have been found recently, suggest-
ing the possibility of spread to humans through consumption 
and meat handling.13–15 Therefore, there is a growing concern 
that MRSA of animal origin may be transmitted by the food 
chain  or  contact  with  colonized  animals.  It  is  noteworthy 
that specific markers for S. aureus species association are 
still uncertain. Although some studies have identified LA-
MRSA from farm and slaughterhouse animals in Asia,2 there 
is still little evidence of potential genetic markers for live-
stock association of MRSA isolates, and not much is known 
about potential relationships between molecular typing and 
phenotype–genotype characteristics of MRSA isolates using 
statistical testing methods. Therefore, we undertook a cross-
sectional study in pig farms and slaughterhouses to sample 
pigs for S. aureus analysis. This study aimed to examine the 
carriage prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility, virulence 
genes, and molecular typing of S. aureus isolates. Addition-
ally, this study builds on previous research to explore the 
high-dimensional  relationships  between  molecular  typing 
and phenotype–genotype characteristics of S. aureus isolates 
using correspondence analysis.

Methods
study design and sample collection
This cross-sectional study was conducted from May to July 
2015 in Jiangmen, China. The target population was pigs, 
which were sampled by the method of multistage sampling 
process. First, 3 county-level cities were randomly sampled 
from 7 county-level city in Jiangmen city. Second, in each 
county-level  city,  3  pig  farms  and  1  slaughterhouse  were 
selected to reach a sample size of about 140 farm pigs and 
350 slaughterhouse pigs. In all, 1,458 pigs were sampled in 
this survey, including 411 pigs from 9 pig farms and 1,047 

pigs from 3 slaughterhouses. Of these, 194 were piglets (<3 
months)  and  1,264  were  grower  pigs  (≥3  months).  Non-
duplicate swabs were obtained from both nares of each pig.

Bacterial isolation and identification
Swabs were soaked into 5-mL enrichment broth (0.25% yeast 
extract, 1% mannitol, 1% tryptone, and 7.5% NaCl) at 4°C 
during transportation, and incubated at 35°C ± 1°C for 24 
hours. Then a loopful of the broth was plated onto mannitol 
salt agar and incubated at 37°C for 24–48 hours. Suspected 
colonies were selected and subcultured to 5% sheep blood 
agar plates and incubated at 35°C ± 1°C overnight. S. aureus 
or MRSA isolates were confirmed by a combination of mor-
phology, Gram staining, catalase test, tube coagulase test, 
DNase test, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for 
the carriage of the staphylococci 16S rRNA, nuc and mecA 
(or mecC) genes.16,17 All S. aureus isolates carried the 16S 
rRNA and nuc genes, and all MRSA isolates carried the 16S 
rRNA, nuc and mecA (or mecC) genes.

antimicrobial susceptibility testing and 
resistant genes
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the 
disk  diffusion  method  according  to  the  recommendations 
of  the  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards  Institute  (CLSI, 
2015).18 Susceptibility was tested to the following antibiotic 
disks: cefoxitin (30 µg), erythromycin (15 µg), clindamycin 
(2 µg), tetracycline (30 µg), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 
(25 µg), rifampin (5 µg), chloramphenicol (30 µg), cipro-
floxacin (5 µg), gentamicin (10 µg), quinupristin-dalfopristin 
(15  µg),  and  linezolid  (30  µg). According  to  the  CLSI 
guidelines, S. aureus isolates were classified as susceptible, 
intermediate,  or  resistant  to  each  antibiotic.  Multidrug-
resistant (MDR) S. aureus (MDRSA) was defined as being 
non-susceptible to ≥1 agent in ≥3 antimicrobial categories, 
extensively drug-resistant (XDR) S. aureus was defined as 
being non-susceptible to ≥1 agent in all but ≤2 categories, 
and pan-drug-resistant (PDR) S. aureus was defined as being 
non-susceptible to all antimicrobial agents listed.19 For all 
S.  aureus  isolates,  the  presence  of  erythromycin-resistant 
genes (erm[A] and erm[C]) and tetracycline-resistant genes 
(tet[M] and tet[K]) was determined by PCR tests described 
previously.20 For linezolid-resistant isolates, the presence of 
resistant genes (cfr and optrA) was determined by PCR tests.21

Molecular characterization
For  all  S.  aureus  isolates,  multilocus  sequence  typing 
(MLST) was performed as previously described.22 Alleles and

sequence types (STs) were assigned by submitting the DNA 
sequences to the MLST database (http://saureus.mlst.net). 
BURST analysis was conducted to analyze clonal complexes 
(CCs) using eBURST V3 software program (Department of 
Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London, 
London, UK; http://eburst.mlst.net). We conducted specific 
PCR tests for the presence of the Panton–Valentine leucocidin 
(pvl) toxin gene, the immune evasion cluster (IEC) genes 
(scn, chp, sea, sak, and sep), the beta-hemolysin gene (hlb) 
and the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec element 
(SCCmec) type.23–25

Data analysis
The differences in S. aureus (including MRSA and MDRSA) 
carriage between groups were determined using the Pearson’s 
chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test when appropriate. Since 
correspondence analysis provides a useful graphic and statis-
tical method for exploring the internal relationship between 
categorical variables, we used the correspondence analysis to 
explore potential relationships between CC and phenotype–
genotype characteristics of S. aureus isolates. These analyses 
were performed using STATA version 14.0 (StataCorp LP, 
College Station, TX, USA), and a 2-sided P value of <0.05 
was defined as being of statistical significance.

(3.3%) MRSA isolates. All MRSA isolates carried the mecA 
gene,  but  all  these  isolates  were  absent  of  the  mecC  (the 
novel mecA homolog). When comparing the carriage rates 
between farm and slaughterhouse pigs, there were statistically 
significant differences in the carriage of S. aureus (6.8% vs 
10.6%; P=0.027) and MDRSA (6.8% vs 10.2%; P=0.043). 
When  comparing  the  carriage  rates  between  piglets  and 
grower pigs, there were statistically significant differences in 
the carriage of S. aureus (4.1% vs 10.4%; P=0.006).

antibiotic susceptibility and resistance 
genes
Among 139 S. aureus isolates, most of isolates were resistant 
to  clindamycin  (97.1%),  tetracycline  (96.4%),  erythromy-
cin  (92.8%),  and  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  (82.7%) 
(Table  2).  Notably,  87  isolates  were  resistant  to  cefoxitin, 
including 48 MRSA and 39 non-MRSA isolates. Addition-
ally, 135 (97.1%) isolates were classified as MDRSA, with 
the most common resistance pattern being non-susceptible 
to clindamycin, tetracycline, and erythromycin (Figure 1). In 
terms of the macrolide-resistant genes (Table 2), the most 
predominant gene was erm(C) (79.1%), followed by erm(A) 
(5.0%). Additionally, there were 6 (4.3%) isolates co-express-
ing erm(C) and erm(A). In terms of the tetracycline-resistant 
genes, 87 (62.6%) carried the tet(K) and 81 (58.3%) carried 
the tet(M). In addition, 51 (36.7%) isolates co-expressed the 
tet(K) and tet(M). Notably, all linezolid-resistant isolates (9 
isolates) were classified as MDRSA, including 1 expressing 
the cfr gene and 6 expressing the optrA gene.

Results
S. aureus, MRsa, and MDRsa detection in 
pigs

carried  S.  aureus,  including  135  (9.3%)  MDRSA  and  48 

Molecular characteristics
Among  139  S.  aureus  isolates  (Table  3),  we  observed  40 
unique STs belonging to 11 CCs. The most common S. aureus 
CCs  were  CC9  (73  isolates),  CC1  (17  isolates),  and  CC5 
(15 isolates), with the predominant MRSA being CC9 (28

isolates) and CC1 (10 isolates). The most common S. aureus 
STs were ST9 (33 isolates), ST2931 (13 isolates), ST920 
(12  isolates),  ST2454  (11  isolates),  and  ST1  (8  isolates). 
Among 48 MRSA isolates, the predominant STs were ST9 
(19  isolates,  including  12  isolates  for  SCCmec  IV,  5  for 
non-types I–VII, 1 for SCCmec III, and 1 for SCCmec V) 
and ST1 (5 isolates, including 2 isolates for SCCmec IV, 2 
for non-types I–VII, and 1 for SCCmec V). As to the IEC 
genes, 112 (80.6%) isolates expressed the sak, followed by 
the chp (60.4%), sea (15.8%), and sep (8.6%). Notably, scn 
gene was absent in all the S. aureus isolates. Additionally, 
hlb  was  present  in  82  (59.0%)  isolates,  but  pvl  was  only 
found in 1 isolate.

Relationships between predominant ccs 
and phenotype–genotype characteristics
The  correspondence  analysis  showed  good  corresponding 
relationships between CC typing and resistance pattern of 
S. aureus isolates (chi-squared=54.98, P<0.001; Figure 2A). 
For example, CC398 was associated with PDR, CC9 with 
XDR, and CC1/CC5/CC8/CC12/CC97 isolates were associ-
ated with MDR. As shown in Table 3, CC398 was associated 
with nonsusceptibility to almost all these antibiotics; CC9 
(including ST9, ST2931, and ST2454) was associated with 
nonsusceptibility to 9 antibiotics; CC1 (including ST1) and 
CC5 (including ST920) were associated with nonsuscepti-
bility to 7 antibiotics; and CC8/CC12/CC97 isolates were 
nonsusceptible to 4 or 5 antibiotics.

Another correspondence analysis revealed good corre-
sponding relationships between CC typing and the number of 

virulence genes (including scn, chp, sea, sak, sep, and hlb) of 
S. aureus isolates (chi-squared=38.03, P=0.004; Figure 2B). 
For example, CC9 and CC8 were associated with carrying 3 
virulence genes, CC1/CC5/CC12/CC97 were associated with 
carrying 1 or 2 virulence genes, and CC398 was associated 
with absence of these virulence genes. As shown in Table 3, 
CC9 (including ST9, ST2931, and ST2454) and CC8 were 
associated with carrying chp, sak, and hlb; CC1 was associ-
ated with carrying sak and hlb; and CC5 (including ST920), 
CC12 and CC97 were associated with carrying chp and sak.

Discussion
This study of pigs indicated that the carriage rate was 9.5% 
for  S.  aureus  and  3.3%  for  MRSA,  which  is  similar  to 
results from previous studies (4.6%–15.9% for S. aureus and 
0.9%–7.7% for MRSA).9,26–31 However, imparity results also 
have been reported. For example, S. aureus carriage rate was 
significant high in India (71.4%) and Ireland (26%–73%),32,33 
and MRSA carriage rate was significant high in Germany 
(49%–70.8%) and Spain (46%).34,35 There may be several rea-
sons for this difference, such as geographical location, sam-
pling methods, bacterial isolation and identification methods 
(conventional biochemical methods or PCR test; enrichment 
or no enrichment), livestock density, and antibiotic usage. 
In this study, S. aureus (including MDRSA) prevalence rate 
in  slaughterhouse  pigs  was  significantly  higher  than  that 
observed in farm pigs. Similarly, a particularly high MRSA 
carriage rate was reported in slaughterhouse pigs in Shanghai 
and Spanish,36,37 which may be explained by co-transportation 
with MRSA-colonized animals.38 Additionally, we observed 
that the prevalence of S. aureus carriage in grower pigs was 
higher than piglets, which is consistent with the report from 
Trinidad.27 This situation may be due to the abuse of antimi-
crobial agents, and grower pigs may have been exposed to 
antibiotics for much longer than piglets.

The  antimicrobial  resistance  of  animal  S.  aureus  and 
MRSA  has  become  an  important  public  health  issue. We 
observed high rates of resistance to erythromycin, tetracy-
cline, and clindamycin among S. aureus isolates, which may 
be  due  to  the  abuse  of  antimicrobial  agents  in  animals  in 
China.39 Similarly, recent reports on animal-related MRSA 
in  China,  Portugal,  and  Japan  showed  that  most  isolates 
were  resistant  to  clindamycin  (88%–100%),  tetracycline 
(47%–100%), and erythromycin (96%–100%).29,40,41 Nota-
bly, in this study, about 97.1% isolates were MDR. A study 
in  Hongkong  demonstrated  that  almost  all  of  livestock 
S. aureus were MDR, suggesting that antimicrobial abuse and 
 overcrowding in animal farming may facilitate the spread of

MDRSA isolates.42 The most predominant resistance pattern 
observed in this study was co-nonsusceptible to clindamy-
cin, tetracycline, and erythromycin, which is similar to the 
findings from China and USA.8,28 Notably, we observed that 
all  linezolid-resistant  isolates  were  classified  as  MDRSA, 
including 1 expressing the multi-resistance cfr gene. Simi-
larly, the latest studies in China and Germany reported the 
emergence of cfr-mediated multi-resistance in staphylococci 
from animals and livestock-related humans.43,44 In contrast 

to cfr, a novel optrA gene confers cross-resistance only to 
oxazolidinones and phenicols. Presence of the optrA gene has 
been detected in Staphylococcus sciuri and Enterococcus of 
human and animal origin,21,45 and we also found 6 linezolid-
resistant isolates expressing the optrA gene. Therefore, both 
linezolid-resistant and MDR isolates must be monitored in 
prospective surveillance programs.

LA-MRSA  has  been  reported  worldwide.  In Asia,  of 
particular interest is livestock-associated CC9. The present

study revealed that the predominant genotype of S. aureus 
and MRSA isolates was CC9, including ST9, ST2931, and 
ST2454. MRSA ST9 was first detected from pig finishing 
holdings in Italy46 and has also been reported to predominate 
in pigs in Asian countries.9,30,47,48 Additionally, LA-MRSA 
CC9  can  colonize  in  retail  meat  and  other  host  species 
(including cows, sheep, and poultry).2,29,49,50 Notably, previ-
ous  studies  revealed  that  pig  workers  carried  LA-MRSA 
ST9  and  patients  without  contact  with  animals  were  also 
tested with MRSA ST9, suggesting the potential LA-MRSA 
transmission from animals to humans by direct and indirect 
animal exposure.8,51 Notably, LA-MRSA CC9 isolates express

Pig-related MRsa and Mssa

 different types of SCCmec, including type IX for Thailand, 
type V for Malaysia, types IVb/V for Hong Kong, and type 
III for China.2 However, MRSA ST9 in this study mainly 
carried SCCmec IV, followed by non-types I–VII. These find-
ings show some regional characteristics in LA-MRSA ST9.
Another important LA-MRSA is CC398, which prevails in 
animals and related workers in North America and European 
countries.6,52 In our study, no MRSA CC398 was found, but 
2 MSSA CC398 isolates were isolated from pigs. Although 
CC398 isolates are rare in Asia, the study from South Korea 
found a high rate of ST398 isolated from breeding pigs since 
these  pigs  were  imported  from  other  countries.2  Besides, 
CC5 and CC97 have been identified in this study, which were 
also  reported  as  LA-MRSA  in  Germany  and  Senegal.11,26 
Therefore, MRSA-carrying animals pose a potential threat 
to human health. Surprisingly, ST1 and ST59 as the typical 
human-associated  MRSA  clones  were  detected  in  pigs  in 
this study, which is consistent with the reports in Africa and 
China.29,53 These findings may add to the evidence of inter-
species MRSA transmission between humans and animals.

It should be noted that a few studies have attempted to 
explore the specific markers for S. aureus species association. 
Recent evidence of European–American CC398 has revealed 
that absence of the bacteriophage-encoded IEC genes may 
be associated with animal specificity and presence of IEC 
genes may be related with human specificity.54,55 This animal-
specificity relation for Asian CCs is still uncertain. The pres-
ent study first revealed that all S. aureus were absence of scn 
gene, suggesting that absence of scn may be associated with 
pig specificity. Additionally, susceptibility to tetracycline was 
observed only in isolates from workers without animal con-
tact, but tetracycline resistance was only found in CC9 from 
animals and animal-related workers.8 Similarly, we observed 
that all pig S. aureus (including MRSA) isolates were resis-
tant to tetracycline, indicating that phenotypic resistance to 
tetracycline may be associated with pig specificity.

The potential relationship between CCs and phenotype–
genotype characteristics of S. aureus is still unclear. Recent 
evidence is limited to use the statistical description to explore 
potential  relations  between  molecular  characteristics.  For 
example, the latest studies of LA-MRSA indicated that all 
MRSA CC97 isolates were MDR and about 90% of MRSA 
ST9  isolates  were  MDR.56,57 These  findings  suggest  that 
there may be differences in resistance patterns between dif-
ferent clones. This study adds to existing literature to reveal 
a  significant  correspondence  between  CC  and  resistance 
pattern of  S.  aureus isolates, indicating that LA CC9 and 

CC398 were associated with severe XDR or PDR. Notably, 
latest studies found that absence of IEC genes may be asso-
ciated with animal specificity.8,58 For example, all MDRSA 
CC9 and MRSA CC9 carried by pig-related workers were 
absent of IEC genes.8 This study first revealed a significant 
correspondence between CCs and the number of virulence 
genes of S. aureus isolates; CC9/CC8 isolates were associated 
with carrying 3 virulence genes (chp, sak, and hlb) and CC5/
CC12/CC97 isolates with carrying 2 virulence genes (chp and 
sak). These findings provide new ideas for monitoring new 
epidemiologic trends and provide implication for facilitating 
vaccine developments.

This study is a new attempt to reveal potential relation-
ships between CC typing and phenotype–genotype character-
istics of S. aureus isolates using the correspondence analysis. 
However, the current study has some limitations. First, the 
research design was cross-sectional, so it could not determine 
whether the nasal colonization was persistent or transient. 
Future longitudinal study may reveal more information about 
colonization dynamics of S. aureus. Second, the present study 
observed 39 isolates resistant to cefoxitin but absent of the 
mecA, suggesting that the MRSA definition based on mecA 
in this study may underestimate the true prevalence. Third, no 
nasal samples were obtained from livestock-related workers, 
so it could not determine whether exists the risk of LA-MRSA 
transmission from animals to livestock-related workers.

Conclusion
All pig-related S. aureus isolates were negative for scn gene 
and  resistant  to  tetracycline,  suggesting  that  absence  of 
scn and presence of tetracycline resistance may be associ-
ated with pig specificity. Additionally, the correspondence 
analysis  found  good  corresponding  relationships  between 
CC typing and phenotype–genotype characteristics, which 
provides  some  implication  for  vaccine  strategies  and  new 
ideas for monitoring new epidemiologic trends. Notably, the 
proportion of MDRSA was high in 97.1%, supporting grow-
ing concern about the potential hazards of non-therapeutic 
antibiotic use.
