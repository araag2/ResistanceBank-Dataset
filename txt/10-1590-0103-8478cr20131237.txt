ABSTRACT

The  soft  cheese  Minas  frescal  is  one  of  the  most 
popular cheese in Brazil, which is typically manufactured in small 
dairy  farms  under  unsatisfactory  hygiene  conditions.  To  assess 
the risk involved in consumption of this cheese, virulence markers 
were  investigated  in  330  Escherichia  coli  strains  isolated  from 
30 Minas frescal cheeses inspected by ofﬁ cial government agency 
(SIF - serviço de inspeção federal), from 50 cheeses not inspected 
by SIF and 31 cheeses not inspected by SIF with spice added, all of 
them collected in the southwest of Minas Gerais State. The E. coli 
isolates  were  screened  for  the  presence  of  Shiga  toxin-encoding 
(stx 1 and stx 2), intimin (eae) genes and for the presence of (pap, 
sfa, afa) genes related to adhesion in epithelial cells. The only gene 
detected by PCR was the sfa gene at one isolate. The strains were 
also screened for resistance to 9 antimicrobial drugs. Predominant 
resistance  was  to  cephalothin,  tetracycline  and  streptomycin. 
Multidrug resistance was found among  isolates from cheese with 
SIF (16.6%), cheese without SIF (8.0%) and cheese without SIF 
with spice added (30.0%) what is a reason for concern due to the 
high consumption of raw milk cheese by the Brazilian population. 

Key words: Escherichia coli, cheese, STEC, ExPEC, antimicrobial

RESUMO

O  queijo  Minas  frescal  é  um  dos  queijos  mais 
populares no Brasil, ele é tipicamente manufaturado em pequenas 
fazendas  de  leite,  em  condições  higiênicas  insatisfatórias.  Para 
veriﬁ car o risco envolvido no consumo deste queijo, marcadores 
de virulência foram investigados em 330 cepas de isoladas de 30 
queijos Minas frescal, inspecionados pela agencia governamental 
oﬁ cial  (SIF-  serviço  de  inspeção  federal),  de  50  queijos  não 
inspecionados  pelo  SIF  e  de  31  queijos  não  inspecionados  pelo 
SIF  e com condimentos adicionados. Todos eles foram coletados 

na  região  sudeste  do  Estado  de  Minas  Gerais.  As  cepas  de  E. 
coli  foram  examinadas  para  a  presença  de  genes  codiﬁ cadores 
de Shiga toxina (stx1 e stx 2), gene da intimina (eae) e também 
para  a  presença  dos  genes  (pap,  sfa,  afa)  relacionados  com  a 
adesão  em  células  epiteliais.  O  único  gene  detectado  por  PCR 
foi sfa em um isolado. As cepas também foram examinadas para 
a  resistência  a  nove  fármacos  antimicrobianos.  As  resistências 
predominantemente detectadas foram para cefalotina, tetraciclina 
e  estreptomicina.  A  resistência  a  múltiplas  drogas  identiﬁ cadas 
entre as cepas de E. coli, provenientes de queijo com SIF (16,6%), 
queijo  sem  SIF  (8,0%)  e  queijo  sem  SIF  com  condimentos 
adicionados (30,0%), o que representa um motivo de preocupação, 
devido ao elevado consumo pela população Brasileira de queijos 
feitos de leite não pasterurizado.

INTRODUCTION

Minas  frescal  cheese  is  one  of  the  most 
popular  cheeses  produced  in  Brazil,  this  soft  white 
cheese  is  made  of  pasteurized  or  raw  milk.  It  is 
characterized  by  a  high  pH  and  moisture  content 
(>55%)  and  low  percentage  of  salt  (1.4-1.6%) 
(MORAES et al., 2009). Escherichia coli is used as 
an indicator of direct or indirect fecal contamination 
of foods, and therefore the possible presence of enteric 
pathogens. In cheese, E. coli is used as an indicator 
to  assess  the  contamination  and  its  presence  may 
indicate  poor  hygiene  conditions  during  processing

or  post-processing  contamination  (O′BRIEN  et 
al.,  2009),  in  Brazil  there  are  speciﬁ c  rules  for  the 
production and commercialization of dairy products 
(BRASIL, 1996, 2001), however the production and 
retail sale of no inspected dairy products is common 
in Brazil (MORAES et al., 2009).

Since  the  occurrence  of  an  outbreak  of 
foodborne  disease  caused  by  enteropathogenic  E. 
coli  associated  with  consumption  of  soft  ripened 
cheese  (MARIER  et  al.,  1973),  the  presence  of 
these microorganisms in cheese acquired additional 
signiﬁ cance.  Verocytotoxin  (VT)-producing  E.  coli 
(VTEC)  also  known  as  Shiga  toxin-producing  E. 
coli (STEC) are among the most important causes of 
foodborne diseases. They are responsible for overall 
human gastrointestinal diseases, including watery or 
blood diarrhea (PATON & PATON, 1998). The STEC 
strains can gain access to milk by fecal contamination 
or by direct excretion (mastitis) from the udder into 
the milk (LIRA et al., 2004). Outbreaks and sporadic 
cases of illnesses have been traced to consumption of 
STEC-contaminated cheese (BAYLIS, 2009).

Some  pathotypes  of  E.  coli  are  capable 
of  causing  intestinal  disease,  while  others  referred 
to as extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), are 
responsible  for  extraintestinal  infections.  Usually, 
ExPEC  isolates  have  specialized  virulence  factors 
enabling them to colonize host surfaces, injure host 
tissues,  and  avoid  or  subvert  host  defense  systems 
(JOHNSON et al., 2005). Among them the P ﬁ mbriae 
(encoded by the pap gene), Sfa ﬁ mbriae (encoded by 
sfa genes) and Afa aﬁ mbrial (encoded by afa gene) 
are  important  virulence  factors  related  to  adhesion 
and  usually  found  among  E.  coli  strains  causing 
urinary tract infection (UTI) in humans. Some studies 
have  suggested  that  food  may  give  raise  to  human 
acquired  ExPEC  strains  (JOHNSON  et  al.,  2005; 
VINCENT et al., 2010).

During  the  last  decade  there  has  been  an 
increasing awareness of potential problems to human 
health caused by the selection of antimicrobial resistance 
among food producing animals (AARESTRUP, 2005). 
Since pathogenic or commensal bacterial species from 
animals  can  be  transmitted  to  humans  through  milk 
or milk products, it seems prudent to explore not only 
resistance patterns to antimicrobials used in veterinary 
medicine,  but  also  to  antimicrobials  used  in  human 
medicine. In Brazil only a limited number of studies 
concerning  the  antibiotic  resistance  of  commensal 
E.  coli  isolated  from  cheese  have  been  performed 
(PANETO et al., 2007).

Cattle  are  an 

source  of  E.  coli  that  infect  and  cause  disease  in 
human  beings  (BAYLIS,  2009).  The  aims  of  the 
present  study  were  to  determine  the  presence  of 
STEC and ExPEC strains in Minas frescal cheese and 
also to verify the resistance of E. coli strains isolated 
from cheese to antimicrobial drugs.

MATERIALS   AND   METHODS

Sample collection, microbiological analysis

A hundred-eleven samples of Minas frescal 
cheese  were  randomly  purchased  in  the  Triangulo 
Mineiro region in the southwest of Minas Gerais State 
from  supermarkets  or  small  food  stores  at  different 
cities.  Thirty  cheese  samples  have  been  inspected  by 
ofﬁ cial government agencies (SIF-servico de inspecão 
federal),  ﬁ fty  were  not  inspected  (without  SIF)  and 
thirty-one  were  not  inspected  and  have  spice  added 
(Origanum vulgare and/or Pretoselium sativum). All 
samples were kept under refrigeration in plastic bags; 
information about dates of production and of assigned 
shelf  lives  sometimes  were  not  presented.  Cheese 
samples  were  collected  over  a  period  of  10  months 
between March and December 2007, and were analyzed 
on  the  day  of  acquisition.  Samples  were  transported 
under refrigeration (4-6oC) in thermal boxes containing 
ice packs and were tested immediately after arrive at the 
laboratory. A 25g portion of each cheese was blended 
with  225ml  of  nutrient  broth  (Difco,  Detroit,  USA) 
for  two  min  at  normal  speed  using  a  Stomacher  lab 
blender and incubated at 37oC for 24h. An 1ml sample 
of  the  nutrient  broth  culture  was  mixed  with  9ml  of 
MacConkey broth (Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) and further 
incubated at 37oC for 24h. One loop of each tube was 
streaked on MacConkey agar.  At least ten colonies from 
each plate with typical E. coli morphology were selected 
and examined by biochemical tests, including hydrogen 
sulphide,  citrate,  urease  and  indole  (KONEMAN 
et  al.,  1997).  The  technique  used  to  determine  the 
most  problable  number  (MPN)  of  coliforms  was 
developed  according  to  the  AMERICAN  HEALTH 
ASSOCIATION (2001) and U.S. FOOD AND DRUG 
ADMINISTRATION (2001). Microbiological standards 
for soft cheese are determined by the ofﬁ cial Brazilian 
parameters of the Ministries of Agriculture and Health 
(BRASIL 1996, 2001).

Polymerase chain reaction

Bacterial  strains  (E.  coli  isolates)  grown 
overnight  in  nutrient  broth  (Sigma  Chemical  Co,  St 
Louis, USA) at 37oC were tested for the presence of stx 
(stx 1 and stx 2) and eae genes using the polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) protocol of CHINA et al. (1996) 

Ciência Rural, v.44, n.8, ago, 2014.

and  the  protocol  of  LE  BOUGUENEC  et  al.  (1992) 
for the presence of pap, sfa, afa genes. DNA templates 
were prepared by boiling in sterile destilled water. The 
DNA was subjected to PCR performed in an Eppendorf 
Mastercycler (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). Stx 1, 
stx 2, eae, pap, sfa and afa genes were detected using 
primers  and  PCR  conditions  in  the  above-mentioned 
protocols. The ampliﬁ ed DNA products were separated 
by  electrophoresis  on  1.5%  agarose  gel,  stained  with 
ethidium bromide and detected under ultraviolet light. 
Reference E. coli strains used as controls were EDL 933 
(O157:H7, stx1, stx 2, eae), FV L2 (sfa, pap, iuc, hly, 
cnf-1) and DH5α (negative control).

Susceptibility testing

susceptibility 

Antimicrobial 

tests 
were  performed  using  the  disk  diffusion  method 
recommended  by 
the  Clinical  and  Laboratory 
Standards Institute (CLSI, 2008). Drug-impregnated 
disks (CEFAR, São Paulo, BR) were placed on agar 
surfaces using a disk dispenser. The following nine 
antimicrobial agents were tested:  tetracycline (TET, 
30μg); sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SUT, 25μg); 
amikacin  (AMK,  30μg);  cephalothin  (CFL,  30μg); 
ceftriaxone  (CEF,  30μg);  gentamicin  (GEN,  5μg); 
streptomycin  (STR,10μg);  nalidixic  acid  (NAL, 
30μg); ciproﬂ oxacin (CIP, 5μg).

RESULTS   AND   DISCUSSION

A  total  of  one  thousand-two  hundred-
forty-three E. coli isolates were obtained from cheese 
samples,  216  isolates  from  cheese  SIF  +  (with  SIF 
inspection,  30  cheeses),  578  isolates  from  SIF  – 
(without SIF inspection, 50 cheeses) and 449 isolates 
SIF  -  /  spice  (without  SIF  inspection  and  added 
of  spice,  31  cheeses).  Using  Brazilian  parameters 
(BRASIL,  1996,  2001)  10  (30.0%)  cheese  samples 
from SIF +, 35 (70.0%) cheese SIF- and 19 (61.0%) 
cheese  SIF-  /  spice  were  in  disagreement  with  all 
microbiological  parameters  as  the  ﬁ nal  evaluation 

(Table  1).  Many  authors  have  been  reported  the 
situation of Minas Frescal cheese in Brazil. BRANT et 
al. (2007) reported 92.5% of cheese inappropriate for 
consume, and MORAES et al. (2009) reported 90.9%. 
FREITAS  et  al.  (2013)  examined  99  Minas  frescal 
cheese samples obtained in retail sale and 44 of those 
presented  E.  coli  counts  higher  than  5x102  colony-
forming  units  g-1.  Microbiological  contamination  of 
cheese  may  originate  from  various  sources.  Such 
sources  during  cheese  production  might  be:  starter 
culture,  brine,  ﬂ oor  and  packaging  material,  cheese 
vat,  cheese  cloth  and  curd  cutting  knife,  cold  room 
and also must be considered the dairy workers as well 
(KOUSTA et al., 2010). DIAS et al. (2012) reported on 
the  implementation  of  good  manufacturing  practices 
(GMP) in a small processing unit of cheese in Parana, 
Brazil  that  the  main  hurdles  for  the  implementation 
of GMP were related to the difﬁ culties to change the 
hygiene  practices  of  food  handlers.  Therefore,  there 
is a need for more severe monitoring by the Brazilian 
Inspection Authorities  to  improve  the  sanitation  and 
hygienic practices adopted on farms or small factories. 
Randomly  three  hundred-thirty  E.  coli 
isolates  were  choosing  to  be  examined  for  PCR 
ampliﬁ cation  and  antimicrobial 
resistance.  The 
distribution  used  was  90  strains  from  SIF  +,  150 
strains from SIF-, 90 strains from SIF- / spice. None 
of the E. coli isolates examined by PCR ampliﬁ cation 
showed  the  presence  of  stx1,  stx  2  or  eae  encoding 
genes,  what  means  there  is  no  STEC  strains  among 
the  cheese  isolates  tested,  as  shown  in  table  2. 
Different  cheese  varieties  have  lead  evidence  of 
STEC contamination based on presence of stx gene or 
isolated STEC (BAYLIS, 2009). In France a cluster of 
four cases of haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) in 
children, caused by E. coli O157-VT2 was traced to 
consumption of cheese made with unpasteurized mixed 
cows’  and  goats’  milk  (DESCHÊNES  et  al.,  1996). 
ALTALHI & HASSAN (2009) examined 50 samples 
of  raw  milk  and  raw  milk  products  in  Saudi Arabia 
and reported one positive E. coli strain carrying stx1

(3.0%) gene and two positive strains for stx 2 (6.0%) 
among the examined samples. ZWEIFEL et al. (2010) 
in a survey of a 3 year monitoring program in Swiss 
examined 1,502 cheeses, among them 80 samples of 
soft cheese and reported the detection of 8 soft cheese 
(10%) contamined by non-O157 STEC strains, all of 
them carrying the stx 2 gene. GONZALES et al. (2000) 
examined 44 soft white cheeses (Minas frescal) in Rio 
de Janeiro, Brazil and isolated 386 E. coli strains none 
of them with stx genes detected. In Brazil, at the best 
of our knowledge, only PANETO et al. (2007) reported 
the analysis of 50 samples of Minas frescal cheese with 
the recovered of 3 E. coli isolates carrying the vt 2 (stx 2) 
gene (2 isolates) and vt 1 (stx 1) gene (1 isolate).

In  the  present  work  also  the  adhesions 
encoding  genes  pap,  sfa  and  afa  were  almost 
absent.  Only  one  isolate  (number  301)  from  cheese 
SIF- presented the sfa gene (0.6%) but it can not be 
characterized as an ExPEC strain, what means there 
is no ExPEC strains among the cheese isolates tested. 
ALTALHI & HASSAN (2009) in Saudi Arabia did not 
found pap and sfa genes among the examined raw milk 
samples but they reported a great percentage of other 
genes such as trat T (serum resistance, 51.5%), iut A 
(aerobactin, 33.3%) and fyu A (yersiniabactin, 24.2%) 
among  the  E.  coli  isolates,  all  of  them  considered 
virulence-associated traits related with ExPEC.

The emergence of antimicrobial resistance 
among pathogens that impact animal health has been 
a  growing  concern  in  veterinary  medicine  (VAN 
DEN  BOGAARD  &  STOBBERING,  2000).  Some 
E.  coli  strains  which  contaminate  dairy  products 
represent a direct hazard to human health due to their 
virulence factors (BAYLIS, 2009), others represent a 
possible source of genes of transmissible resistance 
to  antimicrobial  drugs  used  for  the  treatment  and 
prophylaxis  of 
in  animals 
(VAN  DEN  BOGAARD  &  STOBBERING,  2000; 
AARESTRUP, 2005). 

infections  diseases 

The  susceptibility 

to  9  antimicrobial 
agents for the three hundred-thirty E. coli isolates is 
shown in table 3. Among the isolates from cheese the 
highest resistance was observed against cephalothin, 
streptomycin and tetracycline (Table 3). PANETO et 
al. (2007) examined 48 E. coli strains isolated from 
Minas  frescal  cheese  and  they  reported  resistance 
to  cephalothin  (60.0%),  nalidixic  acid  (40.0%), 
tetracycline  (31.0%),  ampicilin  (29.0%)  among 
the  isolates  examined.  However  it  is  necessary  to 
mention  that  the  author  above  mentioned,  combine 
intermediate  sensibility  value  with  the  resistance 
value  to  create  the  resistance  percentage.  Looking 
in  that  way  the  percentage  of  resistance  reported 
in the present study (Table 3) were quite similar to 
those above mentioned, but higher than the resistance 
reported by CAMPOS et al. (2006) for E. coli strains 
isolated from 24 samples of Minas frescal cheese from 
Goias, Brazil (4.0% for ampicilin and tetracycline). 

UNLU  et  al.  (2011)  examined  120  white 
cheese  samples  in Turkey  and  56  of  those  (46.6%) 
were  found  to  be  contaminated  with  E.  coli.  The 
authors  reported  a  high  level  of  antimicrobial 
resistance among the E. coli isolates to gentamycin 
(60.0%), 
tetracycline  (52.0%)  and  enroﬂ oxacin 
(30.0%), all of them higher than the percentages of 
antimicrobial resistance reported in the present study.
E.  coli  multidrug  resistant  (MDR)  was 
found  in  the  three  types  of  Minas  frescal  cheese 
examined in the present work. The most commonly 
found  MDR  were  to  cephalothin  +  tetracycline  + 
streptomycin  and  sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim 
+  tetracycline  +  streptomycin.  The  results  were 
16.6%  for  cheese  with  SIF  inspection,  8.0%  for 
cheese without SIF inspection and 30.0% for cheese 
without SIF inspection with spice added. AMADOR 
et al. (2009) examined 20 cheese samples in Portugal 
and  isolated  172  bacterial  samples,  31.4%  of  those 
displayed a MDR phenotype, a value higher than the

results described in the present study. Resistance of 
E.  coli  MDR  isolated  from  foods  to  antimicrobial 
drugs  used  in  human  medicine  has  been  a  reason 
for concern due to the risk of dissemination of these 
genes among the human microﬂ ora.

To  conclude,  the  present  study  did  not 
ﬁ nd  STEC  or  ExPEC  strains  among  330  E.  coli 
isolates from Minas frescal cheese. E. coli commensal 
strains isolated from cheeses showed a high level of 
antimicrobial resistance and multidrug resistance, what 
it is a reason for concern due to the high consumption 
of raw milk cheese by the Brazilian population.
