The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of Salmonella spp. in samples 
collected from beef meat at three points of the slaughter line (after skinning, washing 
and cooling) at three slaughterhouses in Brazil that export meat. Detection was based on 
ISO 6579:2002 and confirmed by PCR and qPCR. The isolates were typified using slide 
agglutination tests and PFGE. The antibiotic sensitivity profile was determined using the 
disk diffusion method. Contamination was detected in only one slaughterhouse. The overall 
frequency of contamination by Salmonella spp. was 6.7% of carcasses (6/90) and 2.6% of 
carcass surface samples (7/270). All isolates were confirmed by PCR and qPCR. The serological 
analysis and the PFGE showed a single profile: Typhimurium. The strains demonstrated 
100% susceptibility to ampicillin, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin 
and tetracycline. Positive carcasses after cooling pose a direct risk to consumers, since the 
meat is considered ready to be marketed after this process.

exporter of beef in the world since 2008, and reached an export 
volume has reached 1.6 million tons, with gross revenues of 
approximately US$ 7.1 billion, which represents 28% of the 
international trade (Brasil 2015). Brazil exports to more 
than 170 countries in various regions of the world, such as 
Latin America, Middle East, Russia, the European Union and 
Africa (ABIEC 2016).
The state of Mato Grosso do Sul in the central western 
region of the country is the fourth largest cattle producer 
in Brazil and second in the number of slaughtered cattle, 
with an annual harvest of 3.9 million heads of cattle and an 
accumulated carcass weight of 849,000 tons (IAGRO 2018). 
With regard to beef exports, Mato Grosso do Sul represents 
9.4% of the country’s total, exporting mainly to Hong Kong, 
China, Egypt, Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Chile, Italy, Vietnam 
and the Netherlands (Brasil 2016).
Despite being one of the most important items in the 
human diet and an industry with considerable potential for 
growth, meat and meat products are considered one of the 
main vehicles of pathogens to humans (Rhoades et al. 2009), 
causing foodborne illnesses. Microbiological contamination 
of cattle carcasses occurs mainly during processing and 
handling, such as skinning, gutting, cutting, packaging, 
storage and distribution (Jay 2000, Borch & Arinder 2002, 
Madden et al. 2004). Cross‑contamination by pathogenic 
bacteria through utensils used during the handling of meat is 
an important factor in the development of foodborne illnesses 
(Perez‑Rodriguez et al. 2010, Papadopoulou et al. 2012). 
According to the World Health Organization, Salmonella sp. 
is one of the most relevant pathogens in beef and its presence 
poses a risk to consumers (WHO 2005). Salmonella ser. 
Typhimurium has been reported to be the serovar involved 
foodborne illnesses most frequently associated with the 
consumption of contaminated poultry, pork and beef (EFSA 
2015).The import market sets standards of quality and hygiene to 
be achieved by producing countries. In general, meat destined 
for foreign markets should be analyzed for the presence of 
pathogenic microorganisms and constraints to the marketing 
of these products may occur when microbiological criteria 
set by importing countries are not met (Wilhelm et al. 2011). 
The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) of the 
European Union (EU) was created for the regulation of such 
products. When a risk to public health is identified, necessary 
measures are established, such as withholding, notification, 
seizure or rejection of these dangerous products. Through this 
warning system, health authorities in the EU have confiscated 
shipments of meat from Brazil, Argentina, Australia and the 
United States as the result of stiff control measures directed 
at pathogens, such as Salmonella, which has led to a degree of 
uncertainty among exporters and importers. From February 
2016 to February 2018, two shipments of Brazilian beef 
were confiscated and notifications were issued regarding 
the presence of Salmonella spp. (RASFF 2018).
The United States requires daily testing for Escherichia coli 
and Salmonella spp., while the EU requires the enumeration 
of aerobic mesophilic microorganisms and enterobacteria 
in addition to the detection of Salmonella spp. (Commission 
Regulation‑EC 2007). According to current microbiological 
standards of the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency, chilled or 
frozen carcasses must be free of Salmonella spp. (Brasil 2001).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Quantitative and qualitative studies on microbiological 
safety are very important to the production of high quality 
meat products. The identification of potentially pathogenic 
microorganisms, such as Salmonella, in beef meat during 
slaughter operations contributes significantly to the 
implementation of quality monitoring programs and preventive 
measures, consequently reducing the risks to public health 
(Martínez‑Chávez et al. 2015).
The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence 
of Salmonella spp. in cattle carcasses at different points in the 
slaughtering process at slaughterhouses in the state of Mato 
Grosso do Sul, Brazil, that produce beef for export. For such, 
different diagnostic methods were employed and the antibiotic 
sensitivity of the isolated strains was determined.
Samples. Samples from beef meat were collected from three 
slaughterhouses registered with the Brazilian Federal Inspection 
Service and located in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.
At each slaughterhouse, samples were taken from five carcasses 
per week for six consecutive weeks, as established by the EU for 
microbiological testing on carcasses (Commission Regulation‑EC 
2007) and stipulated in Circular 463 of the Brazilian International 
Trade Control Division, Department of Animal Product Inspection, 
which establishes control programs for slaughterhouses that export 
to the United States and EU member states (Brasil 2004).
Samples were taken from each animal using a non‑destructive 
method at three different points of the slaughter line: after skinning, 
after washing and after cooling. Dehydrated, sterilized sponges 
(Speci‑Sponge ‑ Nasco, Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, USA) measuring 
11.5x23.0cm and individually packed in sterile plastic bags (Whirl Pak, 
Nasco, Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, USA) were used for the collection of 
the samples. The sponges were hydrated with 10mL of 1% buffered 
peptone water (1% BPW) (HiMedia Laboratories, Mumbai, India) 
and rubbed onto the chest (100 cm2), flank (100cm2) and rump 
close the occlusion of the rectum (200cm2) using a sterile stainless 
steel mold measuring 10 x 10cm (total sampled surface: 400cm2). 
The same carcass was tracked through each of the three stations at 
which samples were collected. The sponges were transferred to the 
plastic bags (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, USA) and transported 
to the laboratory under refrigeration.
Strains from the microorganism reference collection of the 
Oswaldo Cruz Institute (FIOCRUZ‑INCQS), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 
were used as negative and positive controls for all techniques: 
Escherichia coli INCQS 00033 (ATCC 25922), Citrobacter freundii 
INCQS 00576 (ATCC 43864), Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica 
serovar Enteritidis INCQS 00258 (ATCC 13076) and S. enterica 
subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium INCQS 00150 (ATCC 14028).
Bacterial isolation. A total of 200mL of 1% BPW were added 
to each plastic bag containing the sponges. The mixture was 
homogenized in a stomacher (Lab‑blender 400BA 6021, Seward 
Laboratory, London, England) for 60 sec and placed in Erlenmeyer 
flasks, which were incubated at 37±1°C for 18±2h. Detection 
of Salmonella spp. was performed according to the method 
recommended by the International Standardization Organization 
(ISO 2002), with modifications. After enrichment (with BPW), 
selection (with Muller‑Kauffmann Tetrathionate‑Novobiocin Broth 
and Rappaport‑Vassiliadis Soya Peptone Broth) and differentiation 
(with Xylose‑Lysine‑Desoxycholate and Salmonella-Shigella agar) 
steps, suspected colonies isolated from standard cultivation media 
were subjected to further biochemical tests, which included indole, 

urea, motility, lysine decarboxylation, H2S production, methyl red, 
Voges‑Proskauer, carbohydrate fermentation (Triple Sugar Iron), 
citrate and β‑galactosidase.
DNA extraction. Prior to DNA extraction, the isolates were 
incubated in nutrient agar. The extraction of bacterial DNA for 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real‑time polymerase chain 
reaction (qPCR) analyses was performed using the DNeasy Blood and 
Tissue kit (QIAGEN, Valencia/CA, USA), following the manufacturer’s 
instructions. The isolates of the following samples were used for 
DNA extraction:
-  Samples biochemically compatible with Salmonella spp.
‑ 
Samples with inconclusive biochemical identification for 
Salmonella spp. (doubtful results for β‑galactosidase and 
citrate)
‑  A random sample (n=85) selected from a total of 259 samples 
biochemically incompatible with Salmonella spp.
End-point  PCR. End‑point PCR for the confirmation of 
Salmonella spp. was performed based on the method described 
by Myint, et al. (2006) using invA primers (Skyberg et al. 2006) 
targeting invA gene. Amplicons were separated by 1.5% agarose gel 
electrophoresis in TAE buffer with GelRed (Biotium, Hayward/CA, 
USA). The image was then recorded with the L‑PIX Image EX photo 
documenter (Loccus Biotechnology, Loccus Brazil, Cotia/SP, Brazil).
Real-time PCR. For RT‑PCR, primers and DNA probes for the 
TaqMan MGB system were designed with the Primer Express 
program (Applied Biosystems, Foster City/CA, USA) targeting invA 
(Table 1). DNA detection was performed using the StepOne Plus 
system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City/CA, USA).
Serotyping. The  Salmonella spp. isolates identified by 
biochemical methods, PCR and qPCR were sent to the National 
Reference Laboratory for Cholera and Bacterial Entero‑Infections 
of the Oswaldo Cruz Institute (Fiocruz), Rio de Janeiro/RJ, Brazil, 
for serotyping by slide agglutination using the Kauffmann‑White 
scheme with O and H antisera.
Pulsed‑field gel electrophoresis. The Salmonella spp. isolates 
identified by biochemichal methods, PCR and qPCR were analyzed 
using pulsed‑field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The bacterial 
suspension was embedded in agarose, lysed, washed and digested 
with the restriction enzyme XbaI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, 
MA, USA) overnight (12‑16h) at 37°C, essentially as described 
in the “One‑Day (24‑28h) Standardized Laboratory Protocol for 
Molecular Subtyping of Escherichia coli O157:H7, non‑typhoidal 
Salmonella serotypes, and Shigella sonnei by pulsed field gel 
electrophoresis (PFGE)” of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (Atlanta/GA, USA, http://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/
protocols.htm) (Ribot et al 2006). Electrophoresis was performed 
in 1% agarose gel using 0.5x Tris‑borate‑EDTA buffer on a Chef 
Mapper XA (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules/CA) at 6 V/cm for 19h 
at 14°C with an initial switch time of 2 min 16 sec and a final switch

time of 63.8 sec. Gels were stained for 30 min at room temperature 
with ethidium bromide (Invitrogen, Carlsbad/CA), destained and 
photographed. Salmonella Braenderup (ATCC BAA‑664) was included 
as reference. Pattern images were acquired using a Kodak Gel Logic 
2200 system and analyzed using the BioNumerics software program, 
version 2.0 (Applied Maths BVBA, Sint‑Martens‑Latem, Belgium). 
Similarities between isolate fingerprints were determined based 
on the Dice correlation coefficient (Hunter & Gaston 1988). A band 
position tolerance of 1.7% was used for the analysis of PFGE patterns 
(Carriço et al. 2005). Dendrograms were generated by unweighted 
pairwise grouping with mathematical averaging (UPGMA). Isolates 
were considered as having the same pulsotype when the number 
and location of the bands were indistinguishable. Isolates with one 
band difference were considered to be of distinct pulsotypes.
Antimicrobial susceptibility profile. The antimicrobial 
susceptibility of the Salmonella spp. strain isolates was determined 
using the disk diffusion method recommended by the Clinical and 
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI 2011), employing the following 
antibiotics: ampicillin, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, 
gentamicin and tetracycline.
Statistical analyses. The rates of positive samples in each 
evaluation period (after skinning, after washing and after cooling) were 
compared using the OpenEpi software program (Dean et al. 2013). 
Fisher’s exact test with the mid‑p method for matched pairs was 
used to determine associations between each two evaluation periods 
and the presence/absence of Salmonella.
Among the 90 samples from 30 carcasses at Slaughterhouse I, 
seven (7.7%) isolates from six carcasses were biochemically 
compatible with Salmonella spp.: three carcasses were positive 
after cooling, two were positive after skinning and after washing 
and one carcass had two positive samples (after skinning and 
after cooling). All carcasses analyzed at Slaughterhouses II 
and III were negative for Salmonella spp. (Table 2).
Fisher’s exact with the mid‑p method for matched pairs 
revealed no statistically significant associations (p>0.05) 
between each two evaluation periods and the presence/absence 
of Salmonella spp. However, a tendency toward an increase in 
differences regarding positivity was found in the comparisons 
after skinning/after washing, after skinning/after cooling and 
after washing/after cooling, as demonstrated by the decrease 
in p-values (Table 3).
Among 270 samples collected from the three slaughterhouses, 
seven isolates biochemically compatible with Salmonella, 
four inconclusive isolates and 85 isolates biochemically 
incompatible with Salmonella were tested using end‑point 
PCR and qPCR. Four samples with inconclusive biochemical 
profiles and 85 samples biochemically incompatible for 
Salmonella spp. were all negative in the end‑point PCR and 
qPCR. The seven isolates biochemically compatible with 
Salmonella spp. were also confirmed by conventional PCR 
and pPCR and exhibited one profile after serotyping. Table 4 
displays the positive carcasses, points of contamination and 
serotype of Salmonella spp.
These strains of Salmonella spp. were also analyzed by 
PFGE and exhibited 100% similarity (Fig.1).
Regarding the sensitivity profile to antimicrobials, the 
strains of Salmonella spp. isolated from cattle carcasses 
demonstrated 100% sensitivity to gentamicin, ampicillin,

DISCUSSION

tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime 
(Table 5).
In the present study, seven isolates of Salmonella spp. were 
recovered from beef meat. Two isolates (2.2%) were found after 
skinning, which is a critical point of the slaughtering process 
due to the possibility of contamination of the substrate surface 
by microorganisms present on the skin, hair and hooves of 
the animal (Lambert et al. 1991, Penney et al. 2007). After 
washing, only one carcass (1.1%) exhibited Salmonella spp. 
Indeed, the purpose of this step is to reduce the microbial load 
in slaughterhouses (Dickson 1988). According to Brazilian 
legislation, maintenance of a minimum of 0.2mg/L and a 
maximum of 2mg/L of free residual chlorine in water is 
mandatory (Brasil 2011). Surprisingly, however, four isolates 
(4.4%) were found after cooling, which may have been due 
to contamination during the movement of the carcasses into 
the cooling chamber. Low temperatures reduce the number 
of microorganisms, but do not cause complete obliteration 
(Michener & Elliott 1964). This contamination may have occurred 
indirectly through the instruments used for slaughtering, 
workers’ clothes (Prasai et al. 1995, Rahkio & Korkeala 1996, 
Pordesimo et al. 2002, Podpečan et al. 2007) and the hands 
of meat handlers (Bell 1997, Gill & McGinnis 2003). The floor 
can also be an important source of contamination through 
the transfer of organic matter to the shoes of workers or the 
spreading of microorganisms by cleaning with water under 
high pressure (Barros et al. 2007).
Positive carcasses for Salmonella after cooling pose a 
direct risk to consumers, since the meat is considered ready 
to be marketed after this process. It is well established that 
a high percentage of foodborne illnesses are caused by the 
failure of consumers to prepare food in a hygienic manner. 
Indeed, a common practice in households is to use the same 
kitchen equipment for both raw meat and fresh raw salads 
and fruits. Such a practice may lead to the cross‑contamination 
of pathogenic microorganisms from raw meat to fruits and 
vegetables, which are mainly consumed without further 
processing. More seriously, washing or disinfecting kitchen 
equipment may not be sufficient to avoid the cross‑contamination

of S. enterica Serovar Typhimurium to ready‑to‑eat foods 
(Gkana et al. 2016).
Among the seven strains serotyped in the present study, 
all were Typhimurium and exhibited a single pattern in 
PFGE. This result demonstrates a clonal relationship among 
these strains, indicating the presence of the same serovar, 
Typhimurium, probably from a same clone, and suggesting local 
contamination restricted to the slaughter room or a handler.
In the present investigation, some strains exhibited an 
inconclusive biochemical pattern for Salmonella spp. after 
culturing, pre-enrichment, selective enrichment differential 
plating and biochemical methods and were confirmed negative 
for Salmonella by the molecular tests. Biochemical tests identify 
Salmonella by the phenotypic profile, which, however, can 
exhibit variability due to the effect of environmental factors 
on gene expression and may lead to false‑negative reactions 
or misinterpretations (Farber et al. 2001, Malorny et al. 2003, 
Settanni & Corsetti 2007).
Due to the short life of meat products, faster diagnostic 
methods are needed. There is considerable discussion about 
the applicability of PCR for the direct detection of Salmonella 
in meat products or carcasses, since the technique detects 
all viable, injured and dead bacteria (Malorny et al. 2003, 
Ibrahim et al. 2014) and the results may therefore not be 
valid, as injured or dead bacteria would not cause infection in 
the host. Thus, complementary diagnostic methods are often 
required, considering the possibility of false negatives due 
to inhibitory substances as well as false positives due to the 
detection of injured or dead bacteria (Wilson 1997). However, 
PCR from the isolates of Salmonella minimizes this error and 
increases the sensitivity of the technique, with the association 
of two or more enrichment broths with plating media resulting 
in a greater number of isolates of Salmonella (Busse 1995, 
Rall et al. 2005). Furthermore, PCR with isolates on selective 
plating saves two days in comparison to the traditional culture 
method as well as minimizes the labor expended and the 
possible misinterpretation of biochemical tests.
The increase in multi-antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella 
strains isolated from humans has been associated with the 
widespread use of antimicrobial agents in food animal production 
(Brown et al. 2017). The spread of antimicrobial resistance 
through the food chain is regarded as a major public health 
issue (Raufu et al. 2014). Thus, the analysis of antimicrobial 
susceptibility is crucial in the clinical and epidemiological 
context (Silley 2012). The antimicrobial sensitivity profile 
allows tracing the spread of multidrug‑resistant strains 

(Olsen et al. 1993, Oueslati et al. 2016). In the case of Salmonella, 
Hur et al. (2012) reported an increase in Typhimurium and 
Newport multidrug‑resistant serotypes. The multidrug‑resistant 
S. enterica serovar Typhimurium definitive phage type harbors 
a chromosomally encoded genomic island (Salmonella Genomic 
Island 1), which is typically responsible for resistance to 
ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamide and 
tetracycline (Hur et al. 2012) and has been isolated from 
human and pork samples, suggesting the transfer of resistance 
to humans via meat consumption (Van Boxstael et al. 2012). 
The strains of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium isolated in the 
present study demonstrated 100% susceptibility to ampicillin, 
chloramphenicol and tetracycline, suggesting that these 
isolates do not harbor the penta-resistant genomic island.
The prevalence of Salmonella spp. in beef is quite variable 
and depends on many factors, such as weather conditions, 
type of management, slaughter conditions and the storage and 
transportation of carcasses. Cross‑contamination and incorrect 
handling practices are often associated with the contamination 
of beef, making it particularly difficult to identify the primary 
source of contamination (Perez‑Rodriguez et al. 2010).
Salmonella spp. was found in beef meat at only one of the 
slaughterhouses investigated and the frequency was low. 
The occurrence of bovine carcasses contaminated with 
Salmonella spp. after cooling imposes a direct risk to consumers, 
since the meat is considered ready to be marketed after this
