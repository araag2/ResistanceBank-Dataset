ABSTRACT

Campylobacter jejuni is an important foodborne pathogen worldwide; however, there is a lack of information on the
prevalence and antibiotic-resistant proﬁle of C. jejuni in the People’s Republic of China. We determined the prevalence and
characteristics of C. jejuni on the retail level in Tianjin, one of the ﬁve national central cities in China. A total of 227 samples of
chicken wings, legs, and breasts were collected from supermarkets and wet markets; 42 of these samples were conﬁrmed to be
positive for Campylobacter contamination. The contamination rates of C. jejuni and other Campylobacter species were 13.7%
(31 of 227 samples) and 5.7% (13 of 227 samples), respectively. A group of 31 C. jejuni isolates was subjected to antimicrobial
susceptibility testing. All (100%) the selected isolates were resistant to ciproﬂoxacin and nalidixic acid; 77.4% were resistant to
tetracycline, 67.7% to doxycycline, 35.5% to gentamicin, 25.8% to clindamycin and ﬂorfenicol, 19.4% to chloramphenicol, and
12.9% to erythromycin and azithromycin. A remarkably high proportion (41.9%) of multidrug-resistant isolates was identiﬁed.
Multilocus sequence typing was conducted to study the population structure of the C. jejuni strains and their relationship to
human isolates. The correlation between antimicrobial resistance traits and certain sequence types (STs) or clonal complexes was
determined as well. A great genetic diversity of poultry isolates was identiﬁed, with 11 STs belonging to 6 clonal complexes and
11 singleton STs. The novel STs accounted for 40.9% (n ¼ 9) of the 22 STs. ST-21, ST-353, ST-354, ST-443, ST-607, and ST-
828 complexes had been previously identiﬁed from human isolates. This study revealed an extensive level of antimicrobial
resistance and genetic diversity in C. jejuni isolated from chicken products in Tianjin, highlighting the necessity of performing
enforced interventions to reduce Campylobacter prevalence in China.

Campylobacter species are the most prevalent food-
borne pathogens in both developing and developed
countries. Campylobacter jejuni is the leading species of
Campylobacter bacteria and is acknowledged to be the most
common cause of campylobacteriosis; infections may lead to
a sequela known as Guillain-Barr´e syndrome (49). The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that
campylobacteriosis ranks as the second most common
foodborne illness in the United States, affecting over 1.3
million people per year. In 2007, an outbreak of 36 Guillain-
Barr´e syndrome cases was reported in a village in
Changchun (Jilin Province, People’s Republic of China),
and C.
jejuni was conﬁrmed to be responsible for this
outbreak (55). The consumption or mishandling of contam-
inated raw or undercooked poultry products is believed to be
the major vehicle of transmission of Campylobacter. As a
microaerobic organism, Campylobacter may adhere to the
skin surface of chicken and form a multispecies bioﬁlm with

other bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa), protecting
the encased C.
jejuni cells from the aerobic stress and
creating a potential risk to consumers (4).

The ingestion of a low dose of C. jejuni (500 to 800
to cause illness (26). The
cells) seems to be sufﬁcient
infected populations suffered from abdominal cramping,
fever, and mild to severe diarrhea. Generally,
these
symptoms are self-limited and disappear after approximate-
ly 1 week without any speciﬁc treatment. However,
Campylobacter infections can lead to some complications
in the immunocompromised patients, such as those
suffering from reactive arthritis and Guillain-Barr´e syn-
drome (41). For the relatively severe cases, antimicrobial
chemotherapy is required. Macrolides and quinolones are
commonly used as the ﬁrst-line therapies, and tetracycline,
doxycycline, chloramphenicol, and gentamicin are the
alternative drugs (15).

Antimicrobials are widely used to promote the growth
of livestock and prevent the occurrence of disease (2, 7).
However, the abuse of these drugs in livestock can increase
the antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter, consequently

causing their therapeutic efﬁcacy on human campylobacter-
iosis to be ineffective (16). Thus,
the emergence of
antimicrobial-resistant strains of C. jejuni has occurred.

jejuni

Although C. jejuni has been reported to be the major
causative agent of bacterial gastroenteritis, there are still
limited data regarding the prevalence and characterization of
C.
in China, where poultry constitutes a great
proportion of the nation’s meat consumption. One recent
study (53) reported that the positive rates of Campylobacter
in chicken samples ranged from 32.7 to 44.1% during 2008
to 2014 and that 100% of the C. jejuni and Campylobacter
coli
to ﬂuoroquinolone.
Another study (56) conducted in central China showed a
17.2% Campylobacter contamination rate in chicken
products and that 100% of the C. jejuni and C. coli isolates
found were resistant to norﬂoxacin and ciproﬂoxacin.

isolates found were resistant

Various phenotyping and genotyping methods have
been developed for the epidemiological surveillance and
population structure analysis of C. jejuni. Current methods
of genotyping are mainly divided into two groups. One
approach is based on comparing enzyme-digested DNA
fragment patterns after electrophoresis, such as pulsed-ﬁeld
gel electrophoresis (50), ampliﬁed fragment length poly-
morphism, and ﬂagellin gene typing by restriction fragment
length polymorphism (35). The other approach is based on
the sequence divergence of speciﬁc genes, such as
sequencing the short variable region of the ﬂaA gene (ﬂa-
SVR) (31) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) (13).
MLST is performed by amplifying and sequencing several
housekeeping genes, followed by analyzing the sequence
variation among alleles from different bacterial isolates (13,
33). MLST has been widely used for the characterization of
pathogenic bacteria such as Arcobacter (34), Bacillus (6),
Campylobacter (13), Helicobacter (38), Mycoplasma (30),
Staphylococcus (44), and Streptococcus (14).

Tianjin is one of the major economic municipalities in
north China and one of the ﬁve national central cities of
China, but the prevalence and characterization of Campylo-
bacter in this area has never been reported. In this study, we
investigated the prevalence and antibiotic resistance proﬁles
of C. jejuni isolated from chicken products in Tianjin, and
we analyzed the genetic diversity of C. jejuni using MLST.
The relationship between the antimicrobial resistance and
genetic diversity of C. jejuni was also assessed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample collection and preparation. Chicken samples were
collected from eight supermarkets and nine wet markets located in
four representative districts of Tianjin from October 2015 to May
2016. These sampling sites were the most popular markets in each
district. Sampling visits were conducted once per week. The
chicken samples included chicken wing middle joints (n ¼ 59),
wing roots (n ¼ 57), legs (n ¼ 56), and breasts (n ¼ 55). All the
samples were randomly selected and transported on ice to the
laboratory within 2 h. The sample analysis was performed
immediately after arrival at the laboratory.

Each sample was placed in a sterile bag, and 30 to 60 mL of
buffered peptone water (Landbridge, Beijing, China) was added to
a ratio of 1 mL/2.5 g of sample. The bag was shaken for 3 to 5 min,

and the rinse solution was collected for
Campylobacter.

the isolation of

Bacterial isolation. The conventional plating analysis and
enrichment analysis were carried out separately for the isolation of
C. jejuni. For the conventional plating analysis, we streaked 100
lL of the rinse solution onto modiﬁed charcoal cefoperazone
deoxycholate agar (Oxoid, Hants, UK), and incubated the plates
under microaerobic conditions (5% O2, 10% CO2, and 85% N2;
Thermo Forma 3131 incubator, Thermo Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA)
at 428C for 48 h. The enrichment analysis was carried out as
described by the International Organization for Standardization in
ISO 10272-1 (24) with minor modiﬁcations. In brief, we added 1
mL of the rinse solution to 9 mL of Preston broth (Haibo, Qingdao,
China). The mixture was preenriched at 378C for 4 h under
microaerobic conditions and then incubated for 48 h under
microaerobic conditions at 428C. Subsequently, 10 lL of the
bacterial culture was streaked onto modiﬁed charcoal cefoperazone
deoxycholate agar and incubated under microaerobic conditions at
428C for another 48 h (24). In both analysis methods, we reported
the colonies with typical morphologies as Campylobacter; these
were translucent, wet, and ﬂat or slightly raised.

Presumptive colonies were collected from each plate and
subcultivated onto Mueller-Hinton agar (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ)
supplemented with 5% sterile deﬁbrinated sheep blood (MHB
agar) until further characterization. The bacterial
isolates were
identiﬁed using a colony duplex PCR assay (12). Conﬁrmed
isolates were further characterized using MLST analysis and
antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

DNA preparation and colony duplex PCR assay. We
performed a colony duplex PCR assay for the rapid identiﬁcation of
C. jejuni. Two sets of primers were used for the conﬁrmation of C.
jejuni; the primer sequences are shown in Table 1. The 16S rRNA
was speciﬁc to the genus Campylobacter, and the mapA gene was
speciﬁc to C. jejuni (12, 40, 52). A single colony was picked from
the MHB agar using a sterilized toothpick and then suspended in 10
lL of sterile water. Then, 1 lL of the mixture was directly
transferred to a PCR tube as the DNA template. We conducted PCR
in a 20-lL reaction mixture containing 2.5 lL of 103 PCR buffer,
0.5 lM 16S rRNA primers, 0.5 lM mapA primers, 0.25 mM each
deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), and 1 U of Taq polymerase
(Tiangen, Beijing, China). PCR was conducted using a Biometra
TProfessional
thermocycler (Biometra, Jena, Germany), and the
reaction conditions were set as follows: 1 cycle at 958C for 10 min;
35 cycles at 958C for 30 s, at 598C for 60 s, and at 728C for 60 s; and
a ﬁnal extension at 728C for 10 min (12). The PCR products were
stained with a 1% (v/v) solution of ethidium bromide and visualized
using a GelDoc 2000 gel imaging system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)
after gel electrophoresis in 1% agarose. All the conﬁrmed isolates
were stored at  808C in vials containing 12% glycerol and 85%
sterile deﬁbrinated sheep blood.

MLST. A total of 31 conﬁrmed C. jejuni isolates were plated
onto MHB agar plates. We collected a loopful of the colonies of
each sample and washed them using sterile deionized water.
Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted using a TIANamp bacteria
DNA kit (TIANGEN Biotech, Beijing, China), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Seven housekeeping genes (aspA,
glnA, gltA, glyA, pgm, tkt, and uncA) were ampliﬁed and sequenced
using a method developed by Miller and coauthors (33), with some
modiﬁcations (Table 2). Each 25-lL of ampliﬁcation mixture was
composed of 2.5 lL of 103 PCR buffer, 1 lM of
the
corresponding primer, 0.2 mM each dNTP, and 0.5 U of Taq

polymerase. The puriﬁcation of the PCR products and the Sanger
sequencing were both conducted by GENEWIZ (Suzhou, China).

Assignment of allele numbers, STs, and clonal complexes.
The alleles and STs were determined by querying the samples
the Campylobacter MLST database (http://pubmlst.org/
against
campylobacter). Each isolate was designated by seven allele
numbers, which constituted an ST. Genetically related STs were
assigned to clonal complexes. Novel alleles and STs were submitted
to the database Web site, and speciﬁc numbers were assigned. We
used Mega 6 (Tempe, AZ) to construct the cladogram of C. jejuni,
and we created a minimum spanning tree using BioNumerics v. 7.6
(Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium) to illustrate the
relationship between human isolates and chicken isolates.

Antimicrobial susceptibility test. The antimicrobial resis-
tance proﬁles of the Campylobacter isolates were determined using
the agar dilution method, according to the Clinical and Laboratory
Standard Institute guidelines (9). Brieﬂy, bacterial colonies
collected from the MHB agar were suspended in 1 mL of
Mueller-Hinton broth to yield a suspension equivalent of 0.5
McFarland standard that contained approximately 1 to 4 3 108
CFU/mL within 30 min. Then, 2 lL of the suspension was streaked
onto the MHB agar containing twofold dilutions of antimicrobials.
The agar plates were incubated microaerobically at 428C for 24 h.
The results were expressed as MICs (15). Isolates that exhibited
resistance to more than two antimicrobials from different classes
were deﬁned as being multidrug resistant. We repeated the test at
least in triplicate. C. jejuni ATCC 33560 was used as the quality
control strain. The tested antimicrobials, interpretive criteria, and
criteria for the quality control tests are all listed in Table 3.

Statistical analysis. We compared the prevalence of Cam-
pylobacter in different chicken products using chi-square test in
Minitab v. 16.2.3 (Minitab, State College, PA). A value of P , 0.05
was considered statistically signiﬁcant. The correlations between
certain genotypes and antimicrobial resistance patterns were tested

TABLE 2. Oligonucleotide primers for MLST of C. jejuni

using the Spearman correlation coefﬁcient in SPSS v. 13.0 (IBM,
Armonk, NY). The level of signiﬁcance was set at P , 0.01.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Isolation and prevalence of C. jejuni from chicken
meat.
In our study, 227 retail chicken products were
collected in Tianjin, China, for the isolation and detection of
Campylobacter. Campylobacters are fastidious bacteria with
demanding growth conditions. Moreover, Campylobacter
grows more slowly than other coexisting microorganisms,
such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter
spp., and Proteus (8, 51). Thus, appropriate isolation
approaches and careful handling are required for
the
detection of Campylobacter in meat samples. To eliminate
false-negative results, a few studies (8, 18, 51) developed
novel selective agars or combined direct plating methods
with enrichment analysis. The direct plating method reduces
the excessive proliferation of coexisting bacteria, and
enrichment analysis provides a better recovery of the injured
cells. The combination of these two methods could achieve a
maximally accurate contamination rate.

In our current study, the 16S rRNA is speciﬁc to the
genus Campylobacter and the mapA gene is speciﬁc to C.
jejuni only. The sample that presented a positive 16S rRNA
product but negative mapA PCR product was determined to
be Campylobacter but not C. jejuni. As shown in Table 4, 42
of the 227 chicken samples were contaminated by Campylo-
bacter, which yielded a positive rate of 18.5%. Among the
Campylobacter-positive samples, C. jejuni (13.7%, 31 of 227
samples) was the leading Campylobacter species, as identiﬁed
by duplex PCR. The other 13 (5.7%) isolates, with two
samples contaminated by both C. jejuni and C. coli, were
determined to be other Campylobacter species. The contam-
ination rate of Campylobacter in our study was relatively
lower than reported in other districts in China and in some
other countries. According to an epidemiological investiga-
tion by the China National Centre for Food Safety Risk
Assessment (3), 26.3% of the retail whole chicken carcasses
in Beijing were contaminated with Campylobacter. Ma and
coauthors (28) determined that the incidence of Campylo-
bacter in retail broiler carcasses in Shanghai was 31.3%. The
reported Campylobacter contamination rate in France was
76.0% (17), in the United Kingdom it was 60.9% (27), and in
Louisiana it was 43.3% (20).

instance,

Previous studies (17, 37) indicated that different types
of chicken products might have different Campylobacter
contamination rates. For
the occurrence of
Campylobacter was reported to be 31.0% in carcasses and
17.0% in carcass parts at the slaughterhouse level in Sichuan
Province, China (21). Another survey (28) investigated the
incidence of Campylobacter in broiler carcasses and retail
broiler meat, reporting rates of 34.1% (46 of 135 samples)
and 31.3% (40 of 128 samples), respectively.

We collected the four chicken products used in the
current study based on the dietary habits of consumers:
chicken meat (breasts) and three chicken carcass parts (legs,
wing middle joints, and wing roots). However,
the
differences among the of Campylobacter incidences in the
different chicken products were not statistically signiﬁcant
(P ¼ 0.750); the prevalence rates we found were 21.8% for
breasts, 20.3% for wing middle joints, 17.5% for wing roots,
and 14.3% for legs.

Packaging has been reported to be another factor related
to Campylobacter contamination. Prepackaged chicken meat
is more likely to be contaminated by Campylobacter
because the packaging can preserve moisture on the surface
of the chicken meat and increase the survival of Campylo-
bacter (22). In contrast, Burgess and colleagues (5) found
that packaged raw meats were contaminated less frequently
with Campylobacter than unpackaged raw meats. Therefore,
our study also investigated the relationship between
packaging and the Campylobacter contamination rate (Table
5). We collected 51 samples from supermarkets that were
prepackaged and another 176 samples that were not
prepackaged. The contamination rate of the prepackaged

samples was 25.5%, which was slightly higher than that of
the unpackaged samples, 16.5%. Nevertheless, no signiﬁ-
cant difference (P ¼ 0.144) was observed between the two
packaging conditions. In other words, in the current study
the Campylobacter contamination rate of chicken products
was not related to the packaging status.

MLST. MLST is widely recognized as a potent tool for
subtyping bacteria due to its simple operation, its easy data
processing, and the accessibility of the information by
researchers around the world. In the current study, we
performed MLST to analyze the genetic diversity of all the
C. jejuni isolates. Overall, the MLST typing for the 31 C.
jejuni
isolates identiﬁed 22 STs belonging to 6 clonal
complexes and singletons (Table 6). New alleles were
discovered in the genes aspA, glnA, gltA, uncA, and tkt. Nine
STs were determined to be novel ones and were assigned
new ST numbers through the MLST database: ST-8240, ST-
8255, ST-8256, ST-8257, ST-8258, ST-8259, ST-8260, ST-
8261, and ST-8262. Of the nine novel STs, four were new
combinations of the alleles that had already been detected.
The other ﬁve STs were the combinations of novel alleles
and previously described alleles. In addition, half the STs
(11 of 22) were not assigned to any clonal complex. The
high genetic diversity shown in the current study is
consistent with many other previous studies (13, 29, 33,
46). It was reported that poultry isolates are genetically
diverse and have a broader distribution among the clonal
complexes (13, 25, 29), probably because C. jejuni might
endure variations only during its growth inside the host (29,
42).

In the current study,

the most prevalent clonal
complexes were ST-354 and ST-21. In a survey to identify
the sequence types and antimicrobial susceptibility proﬁles
of C. jejuni from north China, the most common clonal
complex containing both human isolates and chicken
isolates was the ST-21 complex, followed by the ST-353
complex. The minimum spanning tree created on the basis of
collected data about C. jejuni strains screened from chicken
and human stool showed that the ST-21, ST-353, ST-354,
ST-443, ST-607, and ST-828 complexes, along with some
singletons, were isolated from both humans and chickens
(Fig. 1). These dominant clonal complexes were also
observed in two other investigations (53, 54) characterizing
C. jejuni in east China, indicating that they were potential
reservoirs of human C. jejuni infection. A larger sample size
may be required to study the population structure and
epidemiology of C. jejuni in the future.

quinolone (ciproﬂoxacin [CIP] and nalidixic acid [NAL]),
tetracycline (tetracycline [TET] and doxycycline [DOX]),
and phenicol
[CHL] and ﬂorfenicol
[FLO]). The MICs of the quality control strain C. jejuni
ATCC 33560 were within the reference quality control
range (Table 3). Based on the selected breakpoints, all
(100%) C. jejuni isolates were resistant to the quinolone
class, including ciproﬂoxacin and nalidixic acid (Fig. 2).
This is consistent with the previous studies (3, 7, 20, 28) in
China showing that almost all the C. jejuni bacteria were
resistant to ciproﬂoxacin. The incidence of resistance to the
tetracycline class was also relatively high (77.4% for
tetracycline and 67.7% for doxycycline). The C.
jejuni
isolates analyzed in the current study showed less
resistance to the aminoglycoside class (gentamicin,
35.5%),
lincosamide class (clindamycin, 25.8%), and
phenicol class (ﬂorfenicol, 25.8%; chloramphenicol,
19.4%). Most of
the isolates were susceptible to the
macrolide class; only 12.9% of the C. jejuni isolates were
resistant to erythromycin and azithromycin simultaneously.
Overall, the antimicrobial resistance rates in the current
study were slightly higher than found in other geographical
regions. For example,
the rates of ciproﬂoxacin and
tetracycline resistance were determined to be low in
(32)
Australia (ciproﬂoxacin, 0%;
and Canada (ciproﬂoxacin, 6%) (11).

tetracycline, 19.2%)

Antimicrobial resistance. In this study, we tested the
MICs of 31 C. jejuni isolates from chicken products using
six clinically important classes of antimicrobial agents:
aminoglycoside (gentamicin [GEN]), lincosamide (clinda-
mycin [CLI]), macrolide (erythromycin and azithromycin),

We distinguished 11 antimicrobial resistance patterns in
the current study, shown in Table 7. Of the 31 C. jejuni
isolates, 26 (83.9%) were resistant to more than one class of
antimicrobial agent. The most common pattern was CIP-
NAL-TET-DOX (29%), followed by CIP-NAL (16.1%) and

(12.9%). This
result is partially consistent with other studies (17, 23, 43,
48, 52), in which CIP-TET was reported to be the primary
antimicrobial resistance pattern in countries such as Japan,
Korea, Iran, Poland, and France. Surprisingly, the multidrug
resistance rate was 41.9% in the current study, which is
dramatically lower than in most other investigations in
China but higher than that in some European countries. For
example, the prevalence of multidrug resistance in C. jejuni
isolates was determined to be 39.2% in Beijing, 71.7% in
Shanghai, 90.0% in Shangdong Province, and 91.3% in
Sichuan Province (3, 7, 21, 28). In contrast, multidrug
resistance of C. jejuni was identiﬁed in 17.8% of the isolates
tested in the United Kingdom (27), 11.9% in a central
province of Spain (39), and 0.2% in Poland (48).
Interestingly, in our study the macrolide-resistant isolates
were all multidrug resistant, and there was one isolate (ST-
8259)
the tested classes of
antimicrobials. Moreover, 87.1% of the isolates showed
high levels of resistance, with MIC  128 lg/mL for one or
more antimicrobial agents, including gentamicin, clindamy-
cin, erythromycin, azithromycin, ciproﬂoxacin, nalidixic
acid, and tetracycline (see Supplemental Table S1).

resistant bacteria. In our current study, we found a high
prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant C. jejuni isolated from
chicken products in Tianjin, which highlights the importance
of developing mitigation strategies. These results provide the
Chinese food administration a better understanding of which
antibiotics should be limited in animal husbandry as well as
emphasizing the importance of performing regular tests to
detect Campylobacter bacteria in retail chicken products.

Relationship between MLST and antimicrobial
resistance. The cladogram in Figure 3 depicts the
connection between MLST and the corresponding antimi-
crobial resistance proﬁles. Generally, isolates with the same

ST have the same resistance proﬁle. For example, four ST-
354 isolates were all resistant
to ciproﬂoxacin, nalidixic
acid, tetracycline, and doxycycline (coefﬁcient of 0.602; P
, 0.01), and four ST-8089 isolates had the same
antimicrobial resistance pattern (coefﬁcient of 1.000; P ,
0.01). Interestingly, although some recovered isolates were
attributed to the identical clonal complex, they were distant
in the phylogenetic tree and presented different antimicrobial
resistance proﬁles. For example, ST-8261, ST-1811, and
ST-6500 were all assigned to the ST-21 complex. ST-8261
and ST-1811 are close to each other in the phylogenetic tree,
and both were resistant
to ciproﬂoxacin, nalidixic acid,
tetracycline, and doxycycline, whereas ST-6500 is slightly

distant from them and was resistant to only ciproﬂoxacin
and nalidixic acid. Another intriguing discovery was that
ST-8259, which carries two novel alleles (Table 6), showed
high resistance to all the antimicrobials used in the study
(Table S1).

Previous studies indicated that the ST-354 complex and
ST-607 complex were signiﬁcantly associated with cipro-
ﬂoxacin resistance (10) and that the ST-21 complex was
frequently resistant to ciproﬂoxacin (65.7%) and tetracycline
(19). These ﬁndings are consistent with our
(40%)
observation in the current study.

The mechanism of the generation and development of
antimicrobial-resistant bacteria is complex. The major factor
might be the use of antimicrobials that constitute a selective
environment for the treated bacteria. In addition, spontane-
ous mutation and the acquisition of resistance determinants
from other bacteria also play critical roles in the develop-
ment and transmission of antimicrobial resistance (1, 47).
Molecular typing could be a powerful tool to track down the
origin of antimicrobial-resistant isolates by analyzing the
relationship between a speciﬁc clonal complex and the
correlated antimicrobial resistance patterns (36, 45, 46).

In conclusion, the current study provides a comprehen-
sive understanding of Campylobacter contamination in retail
chicken products in Tianjin. In addition, we identiﬁed a high
level of antibiotic resistance in the C. jejuni isolates and
certain clonal complexes that were related to human disease.
Therefore, further study is needed to ﬁnd the most efﬁcient
control measures to adopt. Because poultry products are the
major reservoir of the bacteria and are the most commonly
implicated foods for Campylobacter infections in human,
further mitigation and intervention strategies should be
developed to reduce the prevalence of this microaerophilic
bacterium in China.
