ABSTRACT

Introduction: Staphylococcal species are pathogens that are responsible for outbreaks of foodborne diseases. The aim of this study was to 
investigate the prevalence of enterotoxin-genes and the antimicrobial resistance profile in staphylococcus coagulase-negative (CoNS) and coagulase-
positive (CoPS) isolates from black pudding in southern Brazil. Methods: Two hundred typical and atypical colonies from Baird-Parker agar were 
inoculated on mannitol salt agar. Eighty-two mannitol-positive staphylococci were submitted to conventional biochemical tests and antimicrobial 
susceptibility profiling. The presence of coagulase (coa) and enterotoxin (se) genes was investigated by polymerase chain reaction. Results: The 
isolates were divided into 2 groups: 75.6% (62/82) were CoNS and 24.4% (20/82) were CoPS. The biochemical tests identified 9 species, of which 
Staphylococcus saprophyticus (37.8%) and Staphylococcus carnosus (15.9%) were the most prevalent. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed 
resistance phenotypes to antibiotics widely administered in humans, such as gentamicin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and erythromycin. The coa 
gene was detected in 19.5% (16/82) of the strains and 4 polymorphic DNA fragments were observed. Five CoNS isolates carrying the coa gene were 
submitted for 16S rRNA sequencing and 3 showed similarity with CoNS. Forty strains were positive for at least 1 enterotoxin-encoding gene, the 
genes most frequently detected were sea (28.6%) and seb (27.5%). Conclusions: The presence of antimicrobial resistant and enterotoxin-encoding 
genes in staphylococci isolates from black pudding indicated that this fermented food may represent a potential health risk, since staphylococci 
present in food could cause foodborne diseases or be a possible route for the transfer of antimicrobial resistance to humans.

INTRODUCTION

Black pudding or blood sausage is a type of sausage, made from 
the blood, fat, and skin of cattle or pig, stuffed into natural or synthetic 
casing, and tied manually. This kind of sausage is very popular in south 
Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. Animal products are susceptible to 
microorganism contamination, and bacteria present in food could 
cause foodborne disease or be a possible route for the transfer of 
antimicrobial resistance to humans1,2.

Members of the genus Staphylococcus are gram-positive cocci, and 
are natural inhabitants of the skin and mucous membranes of humans 
and animals. Currently, according to literature3, this genus comprises 
45  species,  which  are  divided  into  2  groups:  coagulase-positive 
staphylococci (CoPS) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 
based on the ability to coagulate rabbit plasma. On the one hand, 
some CoNS species are components of the natural microbiota of food, 
and play an important role in the manufacturing processes of diverse 
meat-derived products; in particular, in dry fermented sausages, they 
act as starters to ensure the quality and safety of the final products4. 
On the other hand, CoPS and CoNS species, such as Staphylococcus 
aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus, are well

known for their implications in human health and disease. S. aureus 
is considered to be one of the most common pathogens responsible 
for the outbreaks in 1994 and 1998 in São Paulo (Brazil); in general, 
51.5% of the outbreaks were caused by S. aureus5. In addition, the 
incidence of nosocomial infections caused by CoNS has increased 
in the last few years. In Brazil6 and the United States of America 
(USA), CoNS are the most common cause of nosocomial infections 
in the intensive care nursery. They are responsible for blood stream 
infections in neonates, also causing infections of the urinary tract, 
wounds, bloodstream, and the endocardium in immunocompetent 
individuals, where S. saprophyticus is the most prevalent species7. A 
prospective study was conducted from June 2001 to May 2002 in a 
hospital burn unit, with 252 patients; 49 (19.4%) of these developed 
clinically and microbiologically proven sepsis and the most prevalent 
bacteria were S. aureus and CoNS8.

Perhaps  the  most  notable  virulence  factors  associated  with 
staphylococci are the heat-stable enterotoxins (SEs) produced  by 
certain strains. These toxins are a leading cause of gastroenteritis, 
including vomiting, abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and malaise, in 
3–10 h following the consumption of preformed toxin by susceptible 
individuals9. The SEs are classified into 5 classical serological types: 
SEA, SEB, SEC1,2,3, SED, and SEE, but recently other enterotoxins were 
described in the literature, including SEG, SEH, SEI, SER, SES, SET and the 
enterotoxin-like proteins SElJ, SElK, SElL, SElM, SElN, SElO, SE1P, SE1Q, 
and SElU10. Among the CoPS, S. aureus is frequently responsible for 
outbreaks of food poisoning, due to its ability to express 7 different toxins. 
However, other CoPS, such as S. intermedius and Staphylococcus hyicus

  579

Moura TM et al - Enterotoxin genes and antibiotic resistance in staphylococci from food

can also express enterotoxins11. During the period from 1999 to 2009, 
6,349 outbreaks of foodborne diseases were reported in Brazil, and 
20.5% of these cases were caused by Staphylococcus spp. Furthermore, 
enterotoxigenic CoNS have also been isolated from the hands of food 
handlers and food, demonstrating the importance of CoNS in public 
health12,13.

The use of antimicrobial agents in animal husbandry, as a growth 
promoter, has a selective effect in the emergence and maintenance of 
resistant bacteria in animals, animal products, and the environment2. 
Staphylococcus  spp.  have  been  isolated  from  poultry-processing 
plants,  chicken  carcasses,  milk,  and  dairy  products14-17.  Evidence 
suggests that resistant microorganisms or their antibiotic resistance 
genes can be transferred from food, animals, or the environment to 
humans1.

So  far,  in  Brazil,  there  have  been  no  studies  examining  the 
presence of enterotoxin-encoding genes and antimicrobial resistance 
in staphylococcal isolates from black pudding. Therefore, the aim of 
the present study was to investigate the prevalence of enterotoxin-
encoding  sea,  seb,  sec,  sed,  and  see  genes  by  polymerase  chain 
reaction (PCR) and antimicrobial resistance profiling in coagulase-
negative  and  coagulase-positive  isolates  from  black  pudding  in 
southern Brazil. 

METHODS

Bacterial isolates and biochemical characterization

Twenty samples of black pudding purchased in a public market in 
Pelotas in southern Brazil, in the State of Rio Grande do Sul (RS), during 
March to November 2008, were analyzed. The first isolation step was 
to inoculate 25 g of black pudding into sterile buffered peptone water 
(225ml) with subsequent 10-fold serial dilutions. One milliliter of each 

suspension was spread over the surface of each of 3 plates containing 
Baird-Parker agar (BPA) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) supplemented 
with 5% egg yolk-tellurite emulsion. The plates were incubated for 
45-48h at 35°C. Two hundred typical circular and atypical colonies 
of S. aureus were randomly selected from BPA and inoculated on 
mannitol salt agar (MSA) (Hi-Media, Mumbai, India). Typical colonies 
were smooth, convex, moist, 2-3 mm in diameter, gray to jet-black, 
often  with  a  light  (off-white)-colored  margin,  surrounded  by  an 
opaque zone, and frequently with a clear outer zone. Eighty-two 
mannitol-positive isolates were identified to the genus level by gram 
staining and catalase production. The biochemical characterization of 
Staphylococcus species was carried out following the method proposed 
in the literature2. The enzymatic activity of staphylocoagulase (free 
coagulase) was determined in a tube with rabbit plasma (Laborclin-
Pinhais, Brazil) according to the manufacturer. The S. aureus strains 
ATCC 25923 and ATCC 19095 were used as positive controls, and 
negative controls were inoculated with sterile water instead of bacteria. 

Antimicrobial susceptibility test

The antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed by the disk-
agar diffusion method as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory 
Standards  Institute18.  Five  antimicrobials  commonly  used  in  the 
treatment of clinical infection and agricultural procedures were tested 
(concentrations are expressed in µg ml-1): erythromycin (ERY; 15µg), 
tetra-cycline (TET; 30µg), gentamicin (GEN; 10µg), vancomycin (VAN; 
30µg), and chloramphenicol (CLO; 30µg). The strain S. aureus ATCC 
25923 was used as a control.

(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The nucleotide sequence was 
compared with the GenBank database using the Basic Local Alignment 
Search Tool (BLAST) (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).

PCR for the detection of enterotoxin-encoding A 

(sea) and D (sed) genes 

All strains were tested for the presence of sea and sed genes (using 
the primers described in Table 1). The PCR reactions were performed in 
a final volume of 25µl containing 1mM MgCl2 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 
10 pMol of each primer (Integrated DNA Technologies; IDT, Coralville, 
IA), 1U Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), 1× PCR buffer (Invitrogen), 
200µM deoxynucleoside triphosphates (ABgene, Epsom, UK), and 
deionized water (Milli Q plus, Millipore, Billerica, MA). Reactions were 
performed in an Eppendorf Mastercycler Thermal Cycler under the 
following cycle conditions: 5 min at 94°C; followed by 30 cycles of 45 
s at 94°C, 45s at 54°C, and 45 s at 72°C; followed by 5 min at 72°C. The 
S. aureus ATCC 13565 and ATCC 23235 strains were used as positive 
controls for the sea and sed genes, respectively.

Multiplex PCR for detection of the enterotoxin-encoding genes B 

(seb), C (sec), and E (see) 

Multiplex  PCR  was  used  to  determine  the  frequency  of  the 
seb, sec, and see genes in all isolates. The nucleotide sequences 
of the primers are described in Table 1. The PCR reactions (25µl) 
contained 1mM MgCl2 (Invitrogen), 5pMol of each primer (IDT), 1U 
Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), 1× PCR buffer (Invitrogen), 300µM 
deoxynucleoside  triphosphates  (ABgene),  and  deionized  water  
(Milli Q plus, Millipore) per reaction. Reactions were performed in an 
Eppendorf Mastercycler Thermo Cycler under the following conditions: 
5 min at 94°C; followed by 35 cycles of 45s at 94°C, 45s at 55°C, and 

45s at 72°C; followed by 5 min at 72°C. The S. aureus ATCC 14458, 
ATCC 19095, and ATCC 27664 strains were used as positive controls 
for the seb, sec, and see genes, respectively.

RESULTS

Isolation and identification of coagulase-negative  

and coagulase-positive staphylococci from black pudding 

A total of 200 colonies from BPA were inoculated on MSA agar. 
Eighty-two colonies showing mannitol fermentation were selected 
and  divided  into  2  groups  based  on  the  coagulase  test:  75.6% 
(62/82) CoNS and 24.4% (20/82) CoPS. All isolates were tested for 
the presence of the coa gene by PCR and 19.5% (16/82) were coa-
positive (Table 2). Four polymorphic DNA fragments of the coa gene 
were observed in the strains (Table 2). Among the 16 coa positives, 
5 were identified as coagulase-negative and submitted for 16S rRNA 
gene  amplification  and  sequencing.  Three  strains  showed  99%, 
97%, and 90% similarity with Staphylococcus vitulinus (GenBank: 
AM062694.1), Staphylococcus cohnii (GenBank: HQ154559.1), and 
Staphylococcus equorum (GenBank: DQ232735.1), respectively. To 
the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the coa gene 
was detected in these CoNS species. Two CoNS isolates showed 
similarity to Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and S. aureus, and 
were reclassified as CoPS species.

Table 2 shows the overall distribution of mannitol-fermenting CoNS 
and CoPS species identified from black pudding. Nine different species 
were identified; S. saprophyticus was the most prevalent (37.8%), 
followed by Staphylococcus carnosus (15.9%), S. vitulinus (8.5%), S. 
pseudintermedius (7.3%), S. cohnii (6.1%), S. aureus (3.7%), S. equorum 
(2.4%),  S.  schleiferi  (1.2%),  and  S.    intermedius  (1.2%).  Thirteen

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

In the present study, 63.4% of coagulase-negative 
and coagulase-positive staphylococci strains from 
black pudding showed antibiotic resistance (Table 3). 
Resistance to erythromycin (25.6%) and tetracycline 
(23.2%) were the most frequent profiles detected. 
All strains were susceptible to vancomycin, 93.9% to 
chloramphenicol, and 91.5% to gentamycin. Thirteen 
(15.9%) strains exhibited multidrug resistance, and 
erythromycin/tetracycline resistance was the profile 
most commonly observed.

Prevalence and distribution of enterotoxin-
encoding genes (se) in coagulase-negative and 

coagulase-positive staphylococci

Forty (48.8%) of 82 strains were positive for 1 or 
more enterotoxin-encoding genes (Table 4); amongst 
these, 67.5% (27/40) were coagulase-negative and 
32.5% (13/40) were coagulase-positive. The sea gene 
was the most frequently detected (28.6%), followed 
by seb (27.5%), sec (20%), see (17.5%), and sed (5%). 
The Figure 1 shows the amplification profile of the 
enterotoxin-encoding  sea,  seb,  sec,  sed,  and  see 
genes in the control. Five strains (3 CoNS and 2 CoPS) 
exhibited more than 1 gene.

In this study, we found no correlation between 
the  presence  of  the  coa  gene  and  the  detection 
of  coagulase  activity  among  the  staphylococci 
isolates studied, suggesting that the presence of the 
coagulase gene is not necessarily associated with its 
expression. Nine CoPS strains showed coa-negative 
amplification. This behavior can be explained by (1) 
the production of pseudocoagulase, which has been described in 
CoNS22 and could lead to false-positive coagulase activity, or (2) the 
presence of various numbers of degenerate repeat sequences in the 
coa gene, which gives a polymorphic characteristic in number and 
sequence, and could generate a mutation in the target DNA region 
of the coa gene20. On the other hand, 5 CoNS strains identified by the 
coagulase test carried the coa gene. These strains were sequenced, 
and the DNA sequence was analyzed against the National Center 
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database for similarity  with S. 
vitulinus, S. cohnii, and S. equorum. Previous studies also observed the 
presence of the coa gene in CoNS isolated from cheese11. Other authors 
have suggested that the presence of coa gene is not necessarily 
associated with the phenotypic expression of the enzyme23. The 
coagulase test, though specific and sensitive, is subjected to variability 
in sample conditions. Factors like nutrient availability, environment,

and intrinsic physiological conditions of the bacteria can be associated 
with the non-expression of this gene24. The expression of the coa 
gene usually occurs during the exponential growth phase, and it can 
be repressed by an accessory gene regulator (agr). Another locus of 
regulation, called the Staphylococcus accessory regulator (sar), also 
affects the expression of exoproteins in S. aureus, and mutants at this 
locus produce low amounts of coagulase25. A mutation in one of these 
loci could theoretically result in a coagulase-negative phenotype, since 
a small amount of this enzyme does not cause clotting of plasma. PCR 
amplification of the coa gene showed DNA fragments of 550-900bp 
between the strains. The same polymorphic DNA fragments have been 
observed in the coa gene in other studies20,26. 

The  Staphylococcus  species  identified  in  the  current  study 
have also reported by other authors27,28 in artisanal morcilla and 
fermented meat products. S. saprophyticus is considered to be a 
frequent contaminant of fermented sausages and raw meats and also 
has been isolated from rectal swabs of cattle carcasses and pigs. In 
humans, the main reservoir of S. saprophyticus is the gastrointestinal 
tract7,10. The frequency of S. carnosus (15.9%) was relatively elevated 
in the present study, compared to other studies27,28. The presence 
of S. carnosus in black pudding samples can be justified because 
this  species  is  often  described  as  a  common  commercial  starter 
culture for manufacturing sausages29. Staphylococcus vitulinus is a 
member of the Staphylococcus sciuri group and can be isolated from 
animals and various food products of animal origin, like cheeses and 
sausages10,30,31. The occurrence of different species of staphylococci 
in black puddings can be explained by the fact that some species are 
common contaminants of food and others are associated with a lack 
of hygiene during food manipulation.

The lower prevalence of S. aureus (3.7%) detected in black pudding 
samples in the present study agree with previously described results32, 
in which S. aureus was not isolated from samples of black pudding 
analyzed in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The low occurrence of S. aureus 
demonstrated here, compared to other studies, can be explained by 
the fact that some laboratories in developing countries screen for 
presumptive S. aureus based on growth on MSA and/or DNase tests. 
The MSA medium was developed for the presumptive isolation of  
S. aureus in a single step for clinical samples, which is convenient for 
diagnostic laboratories. However, misclassification of the species could 
occur when the classification is based on mannitol fermentation only.

Antimicrobial susceptibility test in staphylococci  

strains from black pudding 

Antimicrobial resistant staphylococci isolated from food have 
been identified in previous studies14-17. None of the strains were 
resistant to vancomycin, consistent with previous studies14-16,33. In 
the current study, a high prevalence of erythromycin and tetracycline 
resistance was observed. One possible reason for this phenotype in 
staphylococcal isolates from black pudding could be that tetracycline 
and erythromycin are drugs used in veterinary medicine and as growth 
promoters34,35. Although tetracycline is an antimicrobial that is not 
approved by the European Union as a food supplement for animals, 
therapeutic and prophylactic use in veterinary medicine is common, 
and Staphylococcus spp. resistant to tetracycline are frequently found 
in cured ham, fermented fish, hard and soft cheese, meat starter 
cultures, and sausage14,16,17. Multidrug-resistant staphylococcal isolates 

Rev Soc Bras Med Trop 45(5):579-585, Sep-Oct, 2012

were detected in the present study, consistent with other studies that 
have isolated multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus spp. from food14,16,17. 
Resistant bacteria isolated from food are an important problem, 
since food may act as a vehicle for the transfer of antibiotic resistant 
microorganisms to humans1,2.

Prevalence and distribution of enterotoxin-encoding genes (se) in 

coagulase-negative and coagulase-positive staphylococci

In the present research, 40.2% of the coagulase-negative and 
coagulase-positive staphylococci isolates from black pudding were 
positive  for  one  or  more  enterotoxin-genes.  Coagulase-positive 
staphylococci are important with regard to food hygiene, because of 
their ability to express enterotoxins. Many studies are conducted to 
evaluate enterotoxin-encoding genes in CoPS isolated from food or 
raw materials13. The CoPS isolated from black pudding in the present 
study were positive for enterotoxin-encoding genes. The species 
Staphylococcus  schleiferi  has  been  described  as  enterotoxigenic 
in refrigerated raw milk, but enterotoxigenic S. pseudintermedius 
was  not  observed  in  food  samples,  and  was  only  isolated  from 
dogs36,37.  Enterotoxin-encoding  genes  were  not  identified  in  3 
isolates of S. aureus. The high prevalence of CoNS (67.5%) that were 
positive for enterotoxin-encoding genes is an important result. The 
enterotoxigenicity of CoNS has been described by other authors10,12,13, 
but few studies have been conducted to determine the presence of 
enterotoxigenic CoNS in food products. Until today, in Brazil, there 
have been few studies investigating the occurrence of enterotoxin-
encoding genes in coagulase negative strains; this could be explained 
by the fact that the Brazilian legislation regarding food contamination 
does not require the determination of CoNS in animal products. In 
Minas Gerais, Brazil13, evaluation of CoNS isolated from dairy products 
responsible for outbreaks of food poisoning revealed that some strains 
carry enterotoxin-encoding genes. The presence of staphylococcal 
enterotoxin  sea  and  sec  genes  have  also  been  observed38  in 
samples  of  CoNS  isolated  from  food.  These  data  demonstrate 
the  toxigenic  potential  of  CoNS  isolated  from  black  pudding.
In the current study, the sea gene was the most prevalent, followed 
by the seb, sec, see, and sed genes. This result agrees with previous 
observations that the staphylococcal enterotoxins SEA, SEB, and SEC 
are the toxins frequently identified in foodborne outbreaks, and that 
the staphylococcal enterotoxins SED and SEE are less common11. 
The SEA and SEB toxins are known to occupy the same locus on 
the chromosome, which may explain why these enterotoxins are 
commonly found together in outbreaks of food poisoning39. 

Conclusions

The  present  study  showed  that  staphylococci  isolated  from 
black pudding are predominantly CoNS, and that S. saprophyticus 
and S. carnosus were the most prevalent isolates. The detection of 
enterotoxin-encoding genes and resistance in staphylococcal isolates 
from black pudding indicated that this fermented food may represent 
a potential health risk, since staphylococci present in food could 
cause foodborne diseases or be a possible route for the transfer of 
antimicrobial resistance to humans. This is the first study that describes 
the detection of antibiotic-resistant staphylococci and the presence 
of enterotoxin-encoding genes in staphylococcal isolates from black 
pudding in southern Brazil.

ABSTRACT IN PORTUGUESE

Prevalência de genes codificadores de enterotoxinas e resistência 
antimicrobiana em estafilococos coagulase-negativo e coagulase-

positivo isolados de morcilhas no sul do Brasil

Introdução:  Estafilococos  são  patógenos  responsáveis  por  surtos 
de  doenças  transmitidas  por  alimentos.  O  estudo  investigou  a 
prevalência de genes de enterotoxinas e o perfil de resistência aos 
antimicrobianos  em  estafilococos  coagulase-negativo  (CoNS)  e 
estafilococos  coagulase-positivo  (CoPS)  isolados  de  morcilhas  no 
sul do Brasil. Métodos: Duzentas colônias típicas e atípicas do ágar 
Baird-Parker foram inoculadas em ágar sal-manitol. Oitenta e dois 
estafilococos manitol-positivos foram submetidos a testes bioquímicos 
e perfil de susceptibilidade antimicrobiana. A presença dos genes da 
coagulase (coa) e enterotoxinas (se) foi investigada por reação em 
cadeia da polimerase (PCR). Resultados: Os isolados foram divididos 
em dois grupos: 75,6% (62/82) CoNS e 24,4% (20/82) CoPS. Através dos 
testes bioquímicos, 9 espécies foram determinadas, Staphylococcus 
saprophyticus (37,8%) e Staphylococcus carnosus (15,9%) foram as 
mais prevalentes. Testes de susceptibilidade demostraram fenótipos 
de  resistência  aos  antibióticos  administrados  em  humanos,  como 
gentamicina,  tetraciclina,  cloranfenicol  e  eritromicina.  O  gene  coa 
foi  detectado  em  19,5%  (16/82)  das  cepas  e  quatro  fragmentos 
de  DNA  polimórficos  foram  observados.  Cinco  CoNS  contendo  o 
gene  coa  foram  submetidos  ao  sequenciamento  do  16S  rRNA  e 
três mostraram  similaridade com  CoNS.  Quarenta amostras  foram 
positivas  para  pelo  menos  um  gene  se,  os  mais  frequentes  foram 
sea (28,6%) e seb (27,5%). Conclusões: A presença de resistência aos 
antimicrobianos e de genes se nos isolados de morcilha indicou que 
este alimento pode representar um risco potencial à saúde, já que a 
presença nos alimentos pode causar doenças de origem alimentar 
ou ser uma possível rota de transferência de estafilococos resistentes 

aos humanos.
