Abstract

Antimicrobial-resistant salmonellosis is a signiﬁcant public health concern glob-
ally. A study was conducted to screen for Salmonella species from a total of 120
samples, of which 50 were retail meat samples purchased from ﬁve randomly
selected sales outlets in the city of Mangalore, India. Twenty poultry fecal mate-
rials freshly voided before slaughter were obtained with sterile spatula and
placed in sterile sealable polythene envelopes, and 20 clams were purchased
from the estuaries of Nethravathi and Kankarnady market. In addition, 30 clini-
cal isolates from Nigeria suspected to be Salmonella by only cultural character-
ization were also included in the study. In all, 30 samples—6 poultry, 8
seafood, and 16 Salmonella isolates from clinical samples—were conﬁrmed
positive by PCR and used in this study. The disk-diffusion test was performed
to determine the zone of inhibition, and detection of resistance genes was tested
by PCR targeting various antimicrobial genes. Resistance to tetracycline (TET),
cotrimoxazole, nalidixic acid, nitrofurantion, and piperacillin/tazobactin was
found in 66.7%, 60%, 53.3%, 50% and 50% of the isolates, respectively. About
60–100% of MDR isolates possessed antibiotic-resistant genes, of the tetracy-
clines resistant isolates, 20 (100%) 6 (30%), 7 (35%), and 10 (50%) carried
tetA,
tetC, and tetG genes, respectively. Of 18 cotrimoxazole-resistant
strains, 18 (100%), 14 (77.7%), and 4 (22.2%) had sul1, sul2, and sul3 genes,
respectively. Of the 14 multidrug-resistant isolates tested, 8 (61%) and 9 (69%)
were positive for cmlA and cmlB genes, respectively, 10 (1.4%) tested positive
for aph(3)11a genes, 8 (57%) tested positive for aac(3)lla, while none was posi-
tive for the aac6 gene. The results show the presence of antibiotic-resistant Sal-
monella spp. in food samples from India and in human samples from Nigeria.

Introduction

Salmonellosis encompasses a wide spectrum of diseases in
humans and animals which may manifest as acute gastro-
enteritis, bacteremia, and extraintestinally localized infec-
tions involving many organs. Although intestinal infection
caused by nontyphoid Salmonella serotypes is usually self-
limiting, effective antimicrobial
if
therapy is essential
spread beyond the intestine occurs (Dione et al. 2011).

The extensive use of antimicrobials in humans and ani-
mals has led to an increase in multidrug resistance among
several bacterial strains. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Sal-
monella strains have been among the major public health
concerns worldwide, while sea food, chickens, and ﬁsh
are known to be important reservoirs of Salmonella spp.
(Bhowmick et al. 2009).

The incidence of resistance to antibiotics of bacteria
originating from food animals or retail meat is on the

rise in developing countries (Van et al. 2007), possibly
as a result of the inappropriate or uncontrolled use of
antibiotics in farming practices. Subsequent transmission
of antimicrobial resistance to humans can be in the
form of either resistant pathogens or commensal organ-
isms carrying transferable resistance genes. However, a
number of studies have investigated the assertion that
the use of antimicrobial agents in animal production
systems might
lead to either a sustained increase in
antimicrobial resistance among animal pathogens or the
occurrence of drug-resistant pathogens in people (Heid-
er et al. 2009; Mann et al. 2011; Morley et al. 2011).

Antibiotic resistance, especially to the most commonly
used antimicrobials in humans and in animal production
systems, is of critical concern in Nigeria where MDR Sal-
monella strains are among the most frequent causes of
bacteremia in children (Fashae et al. 2010). Salmonella
serotypes with reduced ﬂuoroquinolone
susceptibility
from human have been documented (Akinyemi et al.
2007). A previous study which screened Salmonella spe-
cies from food handler and animal isolates showed that
the ﬁngerprinting observed shared the same RAPD pat-
terns, which is indicative of the fact that the food han-
dlers could have been infected from the animal sources as
samples were collected from sites used by food handlers
(Smith et al. 2011).

A total of 120 samples were screened. Of
were retail meat
samples purchased from ﬁve ran-
domly selected sales outlets in the city of Mangalore.
Twenty poultry fecal materials
freshly voided before
slaughter were obtained with sterile spatula and placed
in sterile sealable polythene envelopes, and 20 clams
purchased from the estuaries of Nethravathi and the
Kankarnady market, Mangalore, were placed in a ster-
ile bottle. In addition, 30 isolates of suspected Salmo-
nella cultures (not previously conﬁrmed by PCR) from
collection in the Department of Medical Microbiology,
University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Nigeria, were
also screened.

Bacterial isolation

Salmonella was isolated by the conventional method as
per the protocols recommended by FDA and Andrew
(1996). A sample weight of 25 g was homogenized with
225 mL of lactose broth for 2 min. The mixture was then
incubated at 37°C for 24 h. One milliliter each of pre-
enriched sample was added to 10 mL each of selenite cys-
tine broth (SCB). The inoculated SCB was incubated at
37°C for 24 h. Subsequently a loop full of culture from
each of these broths was streaked on Hektoen enteric agar
(HEA) and xylose lysine deoxycholate agar (XLD) and
incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Suspected colonies of Salmo-
nella (minimum of ﬁve colonies) from each selective agar
were subjected to a series of biochemical
tests which
include oxidase, catalase, IMViC (Indole, Methylred, Vo-
ges-Proskauer, and Citrate), TSIA (triple sugar iron agar
test), LIA (lysine iron agar test), and urease test.

Extraction of template DNA for PCR assay
One milliliter of bacteria grown overnight at 37°C in
5 mL of Luria–Bertani broth was dispensed aseptically in
an Eppendorf tube. Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted
using the cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)
method as described previously by Ausubel et al. (1992).
The DNA quantity and quality was determined using a

PCR was performed using genus-speciﬁc primers hns
(Jones et al. 1993) and invA (Rahn et al. 1992). Brieﬂy,
the reaction was performed in 30 lL volumes containing
3 lL of 109 buffer (100 mmol/L Tris-HCl
[pH 9],
1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 50 mol/L KCl, and 1% gelatin),
50 lmol/L of each of the four deoxyribonucleotide tri-
phosphates (dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP), 10 pmol of
each primer pair, and 1.0 U of Taq DNA polymerase with
2 lL of template DNA. The optimized PCR conditions
consisted of an initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min fol-
lowed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 1 min,
annealing at 55°C for 1 min, extension at 72°C for
1 min, and a ﬁnal extension at 72°C for 10 min. The
ampliﬁed products were resolved by electrophoresis on
2.5% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and
visualized under UV light using a gel documentation sys-
tem (Herolab, Wiesloch, Germany).

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

The antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed using
the disk diffusion method as described by Bauer et al.

ics disks were placed aseptically on it and incubated at
37°C for 16–18 h. Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) guidelines were used to interpret results
(CLSI 2010). The following antimicrobials were used:
ampicillin (AMP, 20 lg), cefotaxime (CTX, 300 lg), chl-

Antimicrobial resistance gene detection

For detecting antimicrobial-resistant genes in 30 Salmo-
nella isolates, target genes conferring resistance to tetracy-
clines (tetA, tetB, tetC, tetD, tetE, and tetG), sulfonamides
(sul1, sul2, and sul3), chloramphenicol (cat1, cat2, and
cat3, cmlA, cmlB, ﬂoR) and aminoglycosides (aph(3)11a,
aac(3)11a and aac6) were screened by PCR with their
respective primers. The cycling conditions and primer
sequences were as described by Ma et al. (2007). The
PCR was performed in 30 lL volumes containing 3 lL of
109 buffer (100 mmol/L Tris-HCl [pH 9], 1.5 mmol/L
MgCl2, 500 mmol/L KCl, 0.1% gelatin), 100 lmol/L con-
centrations each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP,
10 pmol of each primer, and 0.9 U of Taq DNA polymer-
ase (Bangalore Genei, Bangalore, India), with 2.0 lL of
template DNA. The reactions were carried out using a
thermal cycler (MJ Research, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Pri-
mer sequence and cycling conditions are summarized in
Table 1.

Results

All the isolates used in the study were conﬁrmed as Sal-
monella by PCR ampliﬁcation of the hns and invA genes,
which generated amplicons of 152 and 284 bp, respec-
tively (Figs. 1 and 2). A total of 30 samples were con-
ﬁrmed positive for Salmonella by conventional as well as
by molecular methods. Six Salmonella isolates from poul-
try, eight from seafood, and 16 from clinical samples were
used in this study. Resistance to TET, cotrimoxazole, NA,
NIT, and piperacillin/tazobactin was found in 20 (66.7%),
18 (60%), 16 (53.3%), 15 (50%) and 15 (50%) of the iso-
lates, respectively. Resistance to chloramphenicol, CTX,
AMP, and GEN was also detected in 20–10% of the iso-
lates. About half (50.5%) of the isolates were resistant to
at least one antibiotic. All of the 20 TET-resistant isolates

carried tetA gene and 30% (6), 35% (7), and 50% (10) of
the isolates carried tetB, tetC, and tetG genes, respectively.
Figs 3 and 4 shows the plate of representative sample of
tetA and tetB genes recovered from the isolates. Of 18 co-
trimoxazole-resistant strains, 18(100%), 14 (77.8%), 4
(22.2%) had sul1,
respectively.
Table 2 shows the summary of resistant pattern and genes
from all isolates. Six isolates were resistant to chloram-
phenicol, but more isolates (10 of 14 multidrug resistant)
were positive for ﬂoR and cat 2 genes, while 2 (30%) was
positive for cat 3 genes. Of 14 multidrug-resistant isolates
tested 8 (61%) and 9 (69%) were positive for cmlA and
cmlB genes, respectively.

Discussion

Monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends among bacte-
ria isolated from food, animals, and humans is necessary
to inform public policy regarding the appropriate use of
antimicrobial agents in veterinary and human medicine
(Cummings et al. 2013). Some studies conducted in Nige-
ria also indicated considerable prevalence of Salmonella
both in veterinary and clinical samples (Fasure et al.
2012; Ogunleye et al. 2013).

sulfamethoxazole,

In this study, high levels of resistance were found to
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, TET, and GEN; 66.7%,
60%, 53.3%, and 50%, respectively. A comparative study
in Ibadan, Nigeria, reported a high frequency (87%) of
reduced susceptibility to CIP among the chicken isolates
and a high frequency of resistance to TET (93%), NA
(81%), and sulfamethoxazole (87%), while resistance to
chloramphenicol,
trimethoprim, and
AMP ranged from 36% to 59% for the human isolates
(Fashae et al. 2010). In another study, 100% resistance to
ﬂuoroquinolones
from northern
part of Nigeria was reported (Akyala et al. 2013). Only
one poultry isolate from chicken was resistant to CIP in
the present study, but reduced susceptibility was observed
for clinical isolates; and all clam isolates from India were
resistant to NA while in contrast Fashae et al. (2010) in
his previous study reported that four Salmonella Derby
isolates from their chickens showed reduced susceptibility
to CIP and high susceptibility to NA. High level of resis-
tance to NA 16 (53%) as observed in this study particu-
larly from food animal
reafﬁrms the importance of the
need for strengthening collaboration between veterinary
and public health sectors on appropriate detection and
reporting of zoonotic foodborne pathogens (Adesiji and
Fagbami 2006). In addition, the result obtained from this
study is of high signiﬁcance because treatment with anti-
microbials is crucial for the proper management of severe
or invasive human salmonellosis. Fluoroquinolones and
third-generation cephalosporins are now commonly used

in adults for treatment due to widespread resistance to
chloramphenicol, AMP, and cotrimoxazole. Fluoroquinol-
ones are often the last resort for treatment of children
and are listed by the World Health Organization as criti-
cally important antimicrobials for human health (Colli-
gnon et al. 2009). Prescription pattern, availability, and
cost-effectiveness of quinolones as drugs that are usually
prescribed in the management of most resistant bacterial
infections were suggested as factors that could be respon-
sible for continued rapid evolution of ﬂuoroquinolone-
resistant bacteria in Nigeria (Lamikanra et al. 2011). The

limitation of
this study was its inability to compare
human and clinical isolates from the same country set-
ting due to the fact that all veterinary samples suspected
to be Salmonella were not conﬁrmed positive by PCR.
Resistance to traditional antibiotics (AMP, TET, and
SUL) was high in Salmonella isolates from animals and
foods of animals as observed in this study, previously
reported by Deekshit et al. (2012). It is apparent that
resistance to traditional antibiotics such as TETs, AMPs,
and cotrimoxazole and detection of their genes in micro-
bial populations of both countries constitute a public

health concern by limiting the therapeutic choices for
treating salmonellosis in animals and humans. More so,
in most developing countries such as Nigeria and India,
many of these antibiotics are also used commonly in
human therapy due to their low cost and ready availabil-
ity (Wannaprasat et al. 2011). TET-resistant genes occur
most frequently in our study, all of the 20 TET-resistant
isolates carried tetA gene and 30% (6), 35% (7), and
50% (10) of the isolates carried tet B, tet C, and tet G,
genes, respectively. TET-resistant genes were also detected
in most TET-susceptible and resistant isolates. Thus the
present results and those of Deekshit et al. (2012) agree
that some antimicrobial-resistant genes are “silent” in
bacteria in vitro; it further provides an indication that
these silent genes can spread to other bacteria or turn on
in vivo, especially under selection pressure of antibiotic

study showed
detection of cat 1 gene in all the six resistant genes and
in all 14 multiresistant isolates as well as most susceptible
isolates. Five human isolates harbored catA genes while 8
of 10 that harbored cat gene from animal samples were
susceptible to chloramphenicol in vitro. In addition, cat
2 was detected in all the raw food isolates, ﬂoR was
detected in all 13 ﬂorfenicol-resistant Salmonella isolates,
and ﬂoR was detected in all 6 ﬂorfenicol-resistant Salmo-
nella isolates. Chloramphenicol used to be the drug of
choice in the treatment of Salmonella-related infections
in Nigeria after which a survey revealed 72.4–89.2%
increase from 1997 to 2007, thus limiting its therapeutic
value (Akinyemi et al. 2006). Aminoglycoside-resistant
isolates from clinical specimens and food of animal ori-
gin is of public health importance in developing coun-
tries because they are used to treat a wide variety of
infections Davis et al. (2002). The two aminoglycoside-

all the three aminoglycoside-resistant isolates in the pres-
ent study. Of the 14 multiresistant genes, 10 (71.4%)
aminoglycoside-resistant genes aph(3)11a tested positive
and eight tested positive for the aac311a gene. Chicken
and clinical isolates were only positive for aminoglyco-
side-resistant genes and none from the clam isolates. The
fact that only three isolates were resistant in vitro (one
clinical and two from chicken) and susceptible aminogly-
coside isolates tested positive to aminoglycoside-resistant
genes is noteworthy. Thus, the present results and those
of Maynard et al. (2003) indicate that some antimicrobial
resistance genes are “silent” in bacteria in vitro; however,
these silent genes can spread to other bacteria or turn on
in vivo, especially under antimicrobial pressure. The
results show antibiotic resistance in Salmonella spp. found
from India and clinical Salmonella
in food samples
isolates in Nigeria.
