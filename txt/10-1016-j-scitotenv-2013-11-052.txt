1. Introduction

The aim of this study was to examine the Salmonella serovars and antimicrobial resistance within an animal-
based agriculture river system. The study area consisted of a 1345 ha upper part of Pinhal catchment. A total of
384 samples were collected in four years of monitoring. Salmonella was isolated from 241 samples (62.7%),
resulting in 324 isolates. The highest number of Salmonella sp. occurred in samples associated with sites with
high stoking density animal unit per hectare. It was possible to demonstrate the variability of serovars in the
study area: 30 different serovars were found and at least 11 per monitoring site. Thirty-three potentially related
isolates were genotyped by PFGE, one major clone was observed in serovar Typhimurium, which occurred in an-
imal feces (swine and bovine), and different sites and samplings proving the cross-contamination and persis-
tence of this speciﬁc clone. Among 180 isolates submitted to an antimicrobial susceptibility test, 50.5% were
susceptible to all 21 antimicrobials tested and 54 different proﬁles were found. In the current study, 49.5% of
the tested isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial, and multi-resistance occurred in 18% of isolates.
Results indicate a close interaction between animal-based agriculture, Salmonella, and antimicrobial resistance.

The demand for animal protein in the next years is anticipated to in-
crease signiﬁcantly. Economists estimate that by the year 2050, global
meat production must increase by 73% to meet the expected 43%
boost to the world's population. Three other basic factors driving global
demand for animal protein are economic growth and income, the rising
middle-class of countries, and urbanization. Broken down by species, to
meet anticipated animal protein demand, global poultry production will

need to increase by 125%, followed by sheep and goat meat, 78%; beef,
58%; and pork, 37% (Barr, 2012).

The growing consumption of animal products in developing coun-
tries demands a proportional increase in animal production. Considering
the social inclusion of people in developing countries as consumers, the
position of these countries as livestock producers, and that the majority
of production must occur in a conventional manner using large amounts
of antibiotics, studies linking animal production, use of antibiotics, and
environmental quality should be done.

Emergence of antimicrobial-resistant human and animal pathogens
is regarded as a fateful complication of antimicrobial abuse in livestock.
The World Health Organization recently called for the elimination of an-
tibiotics for growth promotion in agriculture that is also used in human
medicine. The European Union (EU) initiated several actions including

the removal of all antimicrobials used as growth-promoting substances
in the livestock industry (Regulation EC 1831/2003) (García-Feliz et al.,
2008). In order to ensure responsible and cautious use of antimicrobials
in livestock and veterinary medicine, and to monitor the antimicrobial
resistance emergence, the major livestock-producing countries have
established their own national surveillance systems, such as NARMS of
the United States (Food and Drug Administration, 2010).

Peak et al. (2007) established that much of the work that led to these
conclusions focused on resistance transfer through the food-supply—
however, resistance might also migrate away from operations via
water. Mackie et al. (1998) detected that animal manure may contain
antimicrobial compounds, which result from on-farm livestock man-
agement. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (2012)
concluded that antimicrobials contained in manure and biosolids may
enhance selection of resistant bacteria by entering the aquatic environ-
ment through pathways of diffuse pollution.

Whether or not antibiotics have a deleterious effect on ecosystem
health cannot be addressed by experimental studies only, as laboratory
studies often have a limited relevance to the environment (Ingerslev
and Halling-Sørensen, 2001). One proposed way to solve this task is
the collection of data gained from environmental sampling (Boxall
et al., 2003).

Salmonella is a public health concern due to the number of cases per
year, and the most common route of infection is through food products
derived from animals such as poultry and pigs, but many strains are re-
sistant to several antimicrobial agents (Hur et al., 2012; Duijkeren et al.,
2003). In Rio Grande do Sul, the southern state of Brazil, Salmonella has
been isolated in foodborne outbreaks and strains presenting antimicro-
bial resistance have been identiﬁed (Welker et al., 2010; Geimba et al.,
2005; Costalunga and Tondo, 2002).

A high percentage of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella strains from
swine production have been demonstrated in Brazil. Kich et al. (2011)
found that 83% (475/572) of Salmonella strains were resistant to
at least one antibiotic, and 43% (246/572) were resistant to four or
more antibiotics. In a recent summary of resistance trends, the NARMS
Executive Report indicated that in 2007, 53.9%, 72% and 43.1% of non-
typhoidal Salmonella isolates from chickens, cattle, and swine, respec-
tively, were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent, which is similar
to those reported in 1996 (FDA, 2010).

The aim of this study was to examine the Salmonella serovars and
antimicrobial resistance within an animal-based agriculture river sys-
tem. It will contribute to our understanding of the relationship between
livestock and environment quality, and human and animal health.

2. Material and methods

The study area consisted of a 1345 ha of the upper Pinhal catchment.
Pinhal is located in Concordia, Santa Catarina, Brazil. The highest points
of nearby hills reach elevations of 724 m, while the lowest parts are at
about 574 m above sea-level. Pinhal is a ﬁrst-order stream and later
forms a second-order stream with the Guilherme River and Rancho
Grande River that drains into the Uruguay River. Uruguay basin has a
fundamental importance because it is a trans-boundary basin; it has
an extension of 2200 km. Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and
Uruguay share the basin. In Brazil, the Uruguay River divides the states
of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul.

The Pinhal catchment is typically agricultural. The area is predomi-
nantly agricultural, with dairy cow, broiler, and pig farming and a
large proportion of land area devoted to corn, pastures, and forage
crops. Detailed descriptions about the number of animal units and
stocking density in each monitoring Site can be found in Palhares et al.
(2011).

Antimicrobial-use information for individual farms was not collect-
ed as part of this study. We know that each feedlot has its own antibiotic
strategy, which varies depending upon the purpose, timing, and amount
and type of antibiotic used. All of the antimicrobials we evaluated are

approved for use in livestock and broiler for therapeutic purposes and/
or growth promotion. Fig. 1 shows the inputs and outputs of antibiotic
resistance determinants along the river.

The interval between manure application and sample collection was
not determined, nor was the amount of manure applied to the crop
ﬁelds monitored. The animal feeding operations and agricultural ﬁelds
upon which manure from the operations was applied could be adjacent
or separate.

2.1. Sampling

Eight monitoring Sites were selected and monitored monthly for
four years (384 samples), from October 2006 to October 2010. The
Sites were located at places where conditions were most representative
and homogeneous, away from areas with point sources, mixing zones,
and non-point sources. The description of each Site is presented in
Table 1. Because convenience sampling was employed for this study,
the samples were not considered to be representative of any particular
livestock-raising practice or manure management strategy.

A total of 180 samples were taken from 14 farms located around the
Pinhal catchment in the 4th year of the monitoring. The number of sam-
ples per farm ranged from 5 to 14 according to animal agriculture facil-
ities. Feces from dairy cow and pigs and soil in corn and forage crops
areas were taken. Feces were collected in the rectum of 10% of the ani-
mals conﬁned in each facility. All facilities were sampled. One animal
corresponded to a single sample, and the sample was composed by
mixing samples from each animal. Soil samples were collected in
areas where animal wastes were used as fertilizer.

2.2. Salmonella isolation

At each Site, in-stream samples were collected on the same day and
stored in pre-sterilized glass bottles and retained in the dark on ice until
being returned to the laboratory for ﬁnal processing (b24 h since sam-
ple collection).

Salmonella was isolated from running water by immersion of a ster-
ile pad in the water for 48 h in all Sites. The pad consists of cotton wool
wrapped in a square of surgical gauze and securely tied at one end with
a long piece of strong string (Quinn et al., 1994). The pad is retrieved
and placed in a jar containing 225 ml of buffered peptone water
for 24 h at 37 °C as a pre-enrichment step. The Salmonella detection
followed the procedures described in ISO 6579 and was adapted from
Michael et al. (2003). Each conﬁrmed isolate was serotyped at the Na-
tional Reference Center, Instituto Osvaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
using a standard slide agglutination assay.

2.3. PFGE of Salmonella isolates and data analysis

serovar occurring in farm's and river's isolates) were submitted to
genotyping by pulsed ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The serovars in-
cluded in this analysis were driven by the farm isolates: Typhimurium
and Panama, most prevalent in swine production, Rubislaw that oc-
curred mostly in bovine samples and Oranienburg isolated from soil.

The bacterial suspension was embedded in agarose, lysed, washed,
and digested with the restriction enzyme, XbaI (New England Biolabs,
Beverly, MA) overnight (12–16 h) at 37 °C essentially as described in
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA) “One-
Day (24–28 h) Standardized Laboratory Protocol
for Molecular
Subtyping of Escherichia coli O157:H7, non-typhoidal Salmonella sero-
types, and Shigella sonnei by pulsed ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE)”
(Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2004 http://www.cdc.
gov/pulsenet/protocols.htm) (Ribot et al., 2006). Electrophoresis was
performed in a 1% agarose gel using 0.5X Tris–borate–EDTA buffer on
a Chef Mapper XA (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) at 6 V/cm for
19 h at 14 °C with an initial switch time of 2 min and 16 s and a ﬁnal
switch time of 63.8 s. Gels were stained for 30 min at room temperature
with ethidium bromide (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), destained, and
photographed. Salmonella choleraesuis subspecies Braenderup (ATCC#
BAA-664) was included as a reference. Pattern images were acquired
using a Kodak Gel Logic 2200 system and analyzed using the
BioNumerics software program, Version 2.0 (Applied Maths BVBA,
Saint-Martens-Latem-Belgium). Similarities between isolate ﬁnger-
prints were determined on the basis of the Dice correlation coefﬁcient.
A band position tolerance of 1.7% was used for the analysis of PFGE pat-
terns (Carriço et al., 2005). Dendrograms were generated by unweight-
ed pairwise grouping with mathematical averaging (UPGMA). Isolates
were considered as having the same pulsotype when the number and
location of the bands were indistinguishable. Isolates with one band dif-
ference were considered to be of distinct pulsotypes.

2.4. Antimicrobial susceptibility-resistance proﬁling

A subset of 180 Salmonella isolates was proﬁled according to the iso-
lates' susceptibility-resistance to 21 antimicrobials using the antimicro-
bial susceptibility test (AST). Disk diffusion AST was carried out as
described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
(2005).

The following antimicrobial agents and each concentration were an-
alyzed: nalidixic acid (NAL), 30 μg; amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC),
20/10 μg; amikacin (AMI), 30 μg; ampicillin (AMP), 10 μg; kanamycin
(K), 30 μg; cephalothin (CF), 30 μg; ceftazidime (CAZ), 30 μg; ceftiofur
(CEF), 30 μg; ciproﬂoxacin (CIP), 5 μg; chloramphenicol (CHL), 30 μg;
colistin (CL), 10 μg; doxycycline (DX), 30 μg; enroﬂoxacin (ENR),
5 μg; streptomycin (STR), 10 μg; ﬂorfenicol (FLO), 30 μg; gentamicin
(GEN), 10 μg; neomycin (NEO), 30 μg; norﬂoxacin (NOR), 10 μg;
sulfametazol + trimethoprim (SXT), 1.25/23.75 μg; tetracycline (TET),
30 μg; and trimethoprim (TMP), 5 μg.

Disk diffusion AST was carried out as described by the Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (2005). Each organism was ﬁrst classi-
ﬁed as resistant, intermediate-resistant, or susceptible to the agent.
E. coli ATCC 25922 was used as a control strain of known antibiotic sus-
ceptibility (CLSI, 2008).

3. Results

A total of 384 samples were collected in 48 days, monthly distributed,
in four years of monitoring. Salmonella was isolated in 62.7% (241/384)
of samples resulting in 324 isolates. Among the Sites, Salmonella ranged
from 9.54% positive (23/241) at Site 1 to 14.94% positive (36/241) at
Site 5. Fig. 2 shows the number of Salmonella positive samples by each
Site.

The prevalence increased downstream. The highest number of
Salmonella sp. isolates by Site occurred in samples associated with highest
animal stocking density, Sites 5, 75% (36/48) and 6, 73% (35/48). Site 1
had the lowest frequency of Salmonella positive samples, 48% (23/48).

When examined over the four year study period, Year 4 had the low-
est counts of positive samples 18% (44/241) and Year 3 the highest, 28%
(67/241) (Fig. 3). Salmonella prevalence ranged from detectable in one
Site, February and August 2010, to all Sites. Seasonally, detection fre-
quency was greatest in the summer and lowest in the winter.

The identical serovar from the same sample was considered a dupli-
cate and counted once. It results in 227 Salmonella enterica subspecies
enterica being completely serotyped. The occurrence is demonstrated
in Fig. 4. The serovars Panama, Infantis, Typhimurium and Derby of sub-
species enterica occurred with the highest frequency. The subspecies
Diarizonae and Houtenae were found once each. In Brazil, Salmonella
Typhimurium and Panama are the most prevalent serotypes isolated
from animals, especially swine (Pereira, 2007; Kich et al., 2007, 2011).

Fig. 3. Distribution of Salmonella positive samples during the years. Year 1, 27% (66/241);
Year 2, 27% (64/241); Year 3, 28% (67/241); Year 4, 18% (44/241).

From all isolates, 30 different serovars were distributed over the
sampled area. This fact demonstrated the high variability of this organ-
ism in the catchment. Three serovars occurred in more than 50% of sam-
ples, Panama (47/48), Infantis (33/48), and Typhimurium (24/48). At
least, 8 serovars per Site per year were found (Fig. 5), suggesting that
a wide range of Salmonella serovars play a role in river microbiological
water quality.

In order to investigate the contamination source, 14 farms were vis-
ited in the last year of this study. Six serovars were identiﬁed,
Typhimurium, Derby, Panama, Rubislaw, Oranienburg, and Livingstone,
from 33/180 positive samples. The comparison, by clustering analysis,
among farms and river samples from four serovars representative of
the potential contamination source, feces from swine and bovine and
soil, is depicted in Fig. 6.

It was possible to compare isolates from four serovars: Typhimurium
(23), Panama (4), Rubislaw (4), and Oranienburg (2). One major clone
group was observed in serovar Typhimurium, which occurred in
swine and bovine feces at different Sites and sampling times as well
(Fig. 6.a). Three minor clone groups were found at different Sites, two
in Typhimurium (Fig. 6.a) and one in Panama (Fig. 6.b). Finally, we ob-
served one clone of serovar Rubislaw isolated from swine and bovine
feces in three different samplings.

Antimicrobial susceptibility/resistance distribution of 180 Salmonella
isolates is demonstrated in Table 2. More than 50% (91/180) were
susceptible to all 21 antimicrobials tested and 54 different proﬁles
were found (Table 3). In the current study, 49.5% of the isolates were

resistant to at least one antimicrobial and multi-resistance occurred in
18% of the isolates. Multi-resistance by sampling Site is demonstrated
in Fig. 7.

More than 10% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin, doxycycline,
nalidixic acid, neomycin, kanamycin, and tetracycline, with the last
two presenting the highest resistance, 21.1% and 13.8%, respectively.

period (Figs. 2 and 3). In mixed-use watersheds, fecal contamination
can be of livestock, human, or wildlife origin. In this study Salmonella
were frequently detected from a majority of Sites inﬂuenced by varying
degrees of agriculture and, in particular, livestock and poultry produc-
tion. Sigua et al. (2009) suggested that a spatial pattern of bacterial
water quality is evident, which can be linked to the different land-uses
and associated practices (presence or absence of animal activities, and
presence or absence of crops).

Salmonella detection among the Site with highest occurrence, Site 5,
75% (36/48), and with the lowest, Site 1, 48% (23/48), was 27%. Site 2,
where there was no economy activity, and the forest was preserved in
agreement with the Brazilian environmental law, showed an occur-
rence of 56% (27/48). In Site 1 there is no riparian buffer zone and
dairy manures went direct to the river. We propose two hypotheses
for it happened in Site 2: presence of wildlife and contact of wildlife
with livestock positive to Salmonella. Jamieson et al. (2004) concluded
that one of the major difﬁculties in microbial pollution assessment is
characterizing wildlife or “background” levels of contamination. Wild-
life, such as waterfowl, can be a signiﬁcant contributor to fecal pollution
within rural watersheds.

The highest occurrences in Sites 5 and 6 were related to animal
stocking density and that swine and broiler farms were established in
an industrial system, when animals have more contact with their feces
inducing a fecal–oral cycle contamination. This also enables better envi-
ronmental conditions for the development of the bacteria.

Site 8 also had a lower occurrence, 58% (28/48). As in Sites 1, 2, and
3, relief on this Site was rougher, providing more choppy waters with
higher concentrations of dissolved oxygen (Palhares et al., 2011).
Other physical and chemical water quality parameters can also inﬂu-
ence the presence of Salmonella. Leclerc et al. (2002) showed that the
presence of enteric bacteria in the aquatic environment depends on a
variety of parameters, which include nutrients. Palhares et al. (2012),
monitoring the Pinhal River, observed a relationship among Sites with
higher animal stocking densities and high concentrations of nitrate.

Year 4 had the lowest occurrence of Salmonella for all Sites 18%
(44/241). This may be related to the reduction of environmental
pressure by the number of animal units, but this information has not
been veriﬁed. During the monitoring period, the Environmental State

Agency proposed an Environmental Adjustment Contract (EAC) for
pig farms. Operations had to improve the waste management and
recovered 10 m of riparian zone on both sides of the river. Manage-
ments proposed by EAC improved environmental quality through the
years. It occurred between Years 2 and 3. The lowest positive samples
in Year 4 could be the result of this process. Results of other years did
not show a pattern of distribution and reduction of positive samples
between Sites.

Salmonella occurrence was highly variable across months. In the
Pinhal region autumn and winter are the driest seasons. The rainfall
probability is high during spring. Strongest rains occurred in September
and October. In Year 1, October, March and April had occurrence to all
Sites. In Year 2, it happened in March and August and in Year 3, Novem-
ber and January. Year 4 showed occurrence to all Sites in November
and December. During the ﬁrst two years of monitoring, occurrence
peak was veriﬁed at the end of summer (March and April) and winter
(August). In the last two years of monitoring they were veriﬁed in the
summer. Vereen et al. (2013) indicated that Salmonella infections
among humans generally peak in summer months but environmental
studies often show varied seasonal peaks for these pathogens, with
some suggesting higher prevalence in summer months.

August and September are the months which there are the soil prep-
aration period for corn crops when farmers use a lot of livestock and
broiler manure as fertilizer, but only in Year 2 the occurrence peaked
in this season. The use of animal waste as fertilizer can be a way to
carry Salmonella to waters. Controlling manure application rate, analyz-
ing manure nutrients, and considering climate and soil conditions, and
plant characteristics are means to reduce the risk of some pathogens
moving with runoff. Farmers on the Pinhal catchment did not use the
animal wastes considering these parameters, but this uncontrolled use
cannot be related with the Salmonella occurrence.

According to Venglovsky et al. (2009) it is a well-established fact
that bacterial pathogens may persist for long periods in animal manures
under typical farm conditions. This may be extended when the temper-
atures are low, moisture remains optimal, and aeration is not used. It is
possible that a combination of extended storage coupled with other
processes, including aeration, may be beneﬁcial in reducing pathogen-
loading in waste material. Farms only had storage systems without aer-
ation of pig waste. Santa Catarina environment law determines
120 days in stored system. Broiler wastes were composted before agri-
cultural use and dairy was directly disposed of in the soil.

The upper sub-basin had the lowest diversity of serovars (Fig. 5).
This region had the largest area of forest. It means fewer sources
of point and non-point pollution, which determines a positive

environmental impact on the microbiological quality of water. Site 1
had a lower environmental pressure (dairy and agriculture) than Site
3 (dairy, broiler, swine, and agriculture), but the farm had a large area
of forest, and therefore, the greatest diversity of serovars can be attrib-
uted to the presence of wildlife.

Despite Sites 5 and 6 presenting the highest number of positive sam-
ples, they showed low diversity of serovars. It can be explained by the
pattern of production in these two Sites: a high presence of industrial
swine and broiler production systems, therefore, genetic, nutritional,
and health managements are standardized. It can indicate that the in-
dustrial livestock production means a high presence of Salmonella in
the environment, but with low diversity.

Site 7 differed from the other Sites because it had the highest human
density in the study area, with homes, a school, and a cemetery. The
presence of humans and their domestic activities is also a potential
source of Salmonella for the environment, and even in sub-basins of ag-
ricultural proﬁle, its presence should be considered, especially in areas
of human concentration, and rate of rural sanitation are low or septic
tank systems are not correctly managed.

In the current study, 49.5% of the tested isolates were resistant to at
least one antimicrobial, and multi-resistance occurred in 18% of isolates.
The percentage of Salmonella-resistant isolates observed in the Pinhal
catchment, 49.5%, was lower than the 83% previously found in pig's en-
vironment/animal samples in the same region area (Kich et al., 2011).
Peak et al. (2007) demonstrated a strong relationship between on-
Site Conﬁned Animal Feeding Operations (CAFO), antibiotic use, and
resistance-gene abundances in surface waters at the ﬁeld-scale. This re-
lationship was veriﬁed in our study. More than 10% of isolates were re-
sistant to ampicillin, doxycycline, nalidixic acid, neomycin, kanamycin,
and tetracycline, with the last two presenting the highest resistance,
21.1% and 13.8%, respectively. Resistance lower than 1.0% was observed
for ciproﬂoxacin and enroﬂoxacin.

However, antibiotic resistance is a dynamic phenomenon and the re-
sults change among different studies, samplings, and locations. For in-
stance, Watabe et al. (2003) observed that 57.7% of the Salmonella
isolates from pig slurry displayed antibiotic resistance to at least two an-
tibiotics, 34.6% of isolates to three agents, and the remainder (7.7%) were
resistant to four antibiotics. Our group had shown 43% of Salmonella iso-
lates resistant to four or more antibiotics among 572 studied in Santa
Catarina State (Kich et al., 2011). A high percentage (95%) of tetracycline
resistance and 30% of multi-resistance (four or more antimicrobials)
were found by Bessa et al. (2006) in Salmonella isolates from swine
lymph nodes, tonsils, intestinal content, and pork sausages, from ani-
mals that were raised in nine farms in Rio Grande do Sul State in Brazil.
The differences in levels of antimicrobial resistance and decreasing
susceptibility may be a result of the common use of prophylactic antimi-
crobials added to the feed for swine and broiler. An increased therapeu-
tic antimicrobial use on dairies may also create a selection pressure for
higher levels of antimicrobial resistance (Berge et al., 2008; Kemper,
2008; Kolpin et al., 2002).

The impact of antimicrobial drugs administered to animals on the re-
sistance of microorganisms depends not only on the amount used and
the type of administration, but also on animal husbandry practices, me-
tabolism within the animal, manure handling, and storage and degrada-
tion rates. Because of this, it is imperative to obtain a better database of
the productive, agricultural, and environmental managements to im-
prove the knowledge and to determine the relationship between anti-
microbials used in livestock and environmental quality.

Unfortunately, we did not have the information about antibiotic
use in each farm, but we can observe that the use of prophylactic antimi-
crobials in swine and broiler feed was common. We also know that the
use of swine, broiler, and dairy manure was done in the wrong way,
without considering the nutrient balance and farms did not have a
Nutrient Management Plan. These conditions increase the risk of devel-
oping resistance and are a threat to human, animal, and environmental
health.

5. Conclusions

Salmonella was detected throughout the Pinhal catchment indicat-
ing a close interaction between animal-based agriculture, pathogen,
and antimicrobial resistance.

The scenarios in the present and the future of animal production are:
high animal density per area, reduced soil for the use of manure as fer-
tilizer, and conﬂicts over water use. Conducting studies that will evalu-
ate the detection of antibiotic resistance in microorganisms is of public
interest, and in basins characterized by intensive animal production will
aid communities, society, and governments in decision-making. These
studies must be connected with animal health policies that promote
the monitoring of animal operation to obtain information on the basis
of farm-related data, individually, regionally, and related to individual
product sectors.

One of the most important strategies must be to maintain the ef-
fectiveness of current drugs by using them responsibly, but this de-
mands a change in attitudes to their consumption. We must invest
in better education and training for veterinarians and farmers
and more comprehensive information for the general public on
the harm done by using antimicrobials improperly in livestock
production.
