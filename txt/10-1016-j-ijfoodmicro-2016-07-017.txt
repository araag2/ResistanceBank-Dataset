ABSTRACT  

 

Salmonellosis is a type of foodborne disease caused by Salmonella enterica and is a frequent 

cause  of  childhood  diarrhea  in  Vietnam.  Of  particular  concern  is  the  dissemination  of 

multidrug-resistant  Salmonella,  as  extended-spectrum  β-lactamase  (ESBL)-positive  isolates 

were  recently  detected  in  children  in  Vietnam.  In  the  present  study,  the  prevalence  and 

antibiotic resistance of Salmonella isolates obtained from 409 raw meat and seafood samples 

collected  between  October  2012  and  March  2015  from  slaughterhouses,  wholesale  fish 

market,  and  retail  markets  in  Ho  Chi  Minh  City,  Vietnam  were  examined.  A  high  rate  of 

Salmonella contamination was detected in the pork (69.7%), poultry (65.3%), beef (58.3%), 

shrimp  (49.1%),  and  farmed  freshwater  fish  samples  (36.6%).  A  total  of  53  Salmonella 

serovars  were  found,  of  which  S.  Rissen,  S.  Weltevreden,  S.  London,  S.  Anatum,  S. 

Typhimurium,  and  S.  Corvallis  were  the  most  prevalent.  In  addition,  4  monophasic  S. 

Typhimurium  strains  were  identified  using  a  PCR  method  for  the  detection  of  a  specific 

IS200  fragment  within  the  fliB-fliA  intergenic  region.  The  Salmonella  isolates  had  a  high 

prevalence  (62.2%)  of  resistance  to  antimicrobial  agents,  particularly  tetracycline  (53.3%), 

ampicillin  (43.8%),  chloramphenicol  (37.5%),  and  trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole  (31.3%). 

Isolates  with  resistance  to  three  or  more  classes  of  antimicrobials  were  found  (41.1%). 

Especially, isolates such as S. monophasic Typhimurium, S. Schwarzengrund, S. Indiana, S. 

Newport,  S.  Saintpaul  and  S.  Bovismorbificans  exhibited  resistance  to  6  classes  of 

antimicrobials  (3.3%).  All  7  S.  Indiana  strains  were  resistant  to  between  4  and  6  classes  of 

antimicrobials, including ciprofloxacin, which is commonly used for the treatment of human 

Salmonella  infections.  Two  fish  isolates  wereconfirmed  to  be  CTX-M-55  ESBL-producing

Salmonella  serovars  Bovismorbificans  and  Newport,  and  five  CMY-2  AmpC-producing 

Salmonella isolates of serovars Braenderup (4) and Typhimurium (1) were detected in poultry 

samples.  The  findings  from  this  study,  which  is  the  first  report  of  ESBL-  and  AmpC-

producing  Salmonella  isolates  from  food  in  Vietnam,  indicate  that  multidrug-resistant 

Salmonella  are  widely  disseminated  not  only  in  meats,  but  also  in  seafood,  within  the  food 

distribution system of Vietnam. The presence of these multidrug-resistant strains is a public 

health concern and suggests that the use of antimicrobial agents in both humans and animals 

in Vietnam should be tightly controlled. 

 

1. Introduction 

 

Foodborne  diseases,  particularly  those  associated  with  Salmonella,  are  an  emerging 

public  health  problem  worldwide.  For  example,  nontyphoidal  Salmonella  gastroenteritis 

accounts for 80.3 million global cases of foodborne illness each year (Majowicz et al., 2010). 

In  southern  Vietnam,  Salmonella  is  the  fourth  most  frequent  causative  organism  of  infant 

diarrhea (Anders et al., 2015). Although measures to prevent the transmission of Salmonella 

from  foods  to  humans  are  warranted  in  Vietnam,  a  nationwide  surveillance  program  for 

monitoring Salmonella food contamination has not been established (Ta et al., 2014).  

Antimicrobials are widely used in humans and livestock as therapeutics, but are also 

administered  for  disease  prevention  and  growth  promotion.  In  Vietnam,  high  doses  of 

antimicrobials are permissible in livestock, and several antimicrobial agents can be obtained 

without a doctor’s prescription (Nga et  al.,  2014;  Pham  et  al.,  2013;  Thai  et  al.,  2012a). As 

the  overuse  and  misuse  of  antimicrobials  is  generally  considered  to  promote  and  accelerate 

the  spread  of  antimicrobial-resistant  bacteria,  there  is  concern  that  human  and  animal 

 

3 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

pathogens may acquire antimicrobial resistance genes through horizontal gene transfer (Pham 

et al., 2013).  

The  occurrence  of  extended-spectrum  β-lactamase  (ESBL)-  and  AmpC-β-lactamase 

(AmpC)-producing bacteria, which are able to hydrolyze third-generation cephalosporins, has 

increased worldwide during the last decade (Peter-Getzlaff  et  al.,  2011; Trang et  al.,  2013). 

As  plasmid-encoded  ESBL  and  AmpC  genes  are  easily  transferred  between  bacteria 

(Overdevest  et  al.,  2011),  such  horizontal  transmission  represents  a  serious threat  to global 

public health, as resistance to β-lactams severely limits the choice of effective antimicrobial 

agents,  particularly  in  the  case  of  coresistance  to  other  antimicrobial  classes,  such  as  the 

fluoroquinolones (Liebana et al., 2013). 

ESBL-  and  AmpC-producing  Salmonella  isolates  have  been  detected  worldwide, 

including  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (Wu  et  al.,  2013;  Yang  et  al.,  2014),  Germany 

(Rodrı´guez  et  al.,  2009),  the  United  States  (Winokur  et  al.,  2001),  and  Brazil  (Biffi  et  al., 

2014). In Vietnam, the antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella isolates from pork, poultry, and 

beef have been extensively examined (Ta et al., 2014; Thai et al., 2012a; Tu et al., 2015); to 

date, however, ESBL- and AmpC-producing Salmonella have not been detected in the food 

distribution  system  within  Vietnam.  Recently,  ESBL-producing  Salmonella  isolates  were 

detected  in  stool  samples  obtained  from  children  with  diarrhea  in  Ho  Chi  Minh  City 

(HCMC), Vietnam (Thompson et al., 2015), although the origin of these Salmonella isolates 

was not determined. 

Vietnam  is  the  third  largest  worldwide  producer  of  aquaculture  products  (Anonymous, 

2012),  and  Vietnamese  meals  typically  include  servings  of  fish  and  shrimp.  However,  the 

prevalence of Salmonella in fish and shrimp consumed in Vietnam has only been examined in 

a  few  studies  (Phan  et  al.,  2005;  Van  et  al.,  2007).  More  recently,  ESBL-producing 

Salmonella  was  detected  in  seafood  imported  into  the  United  States  from  the  People's 

 

4 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

Republic of China and Vietnam (Bae et al., 2015). This finding suggests that antimicrobial-

resistant  strains  of  Salmonella,  including  ESBL-  and  AmpC-producing  stains,  may  be 

distributed among fish and shrimp in HCMC, Vietnam.  

In the present study, we investigated the prevalence of Salmonella in raw meat, which is 

the main source of Salmonella infection, and raw seafood samples collected at various points 

within  the  food  distribution  system  of  HCMC,  Vietnam.  The  aims  of  this  study  were  to 

determine 

the  Salmonella  contamination  rate,  prevalence  of  antimicrobial-resistant 

Salmonella, and phenotype and genotype of ESBL- and AmpC-producing Salmonella isolates 

from raw meat and seafood samples collected from slaughter houses, wholesale fish market, 

and retail stores. 

 

2.  Materials and methods 

 

2.1  Food sampling 

 

A  total  of  409  raw  meat  and  seafood  samples  were  collected  from  slaughter  houses 

(30 poultry, 30 pork, and 30 beef samples), a wholesale fish market (12 farmed shrimp and 

28  farmed  freshwater  fish  samples),  and  retail  stores  (42  poultry,  69  pork,  54  beef,  41 

farmed  shrimp,  and  73  farmed  freshwater  fish  samples)  in  HCMC,  Vietnam  between 

October 2012 and March 2015. Each sample (≥100 g) was placed in a sterile plastic bag and 

transported  on  ice  to  the  microbiology  laboratory  at  the  Institute  of  Public  Health  Ho  Chi 

Minh City, Vietnam. All samples were tested within 24 h of their collection. 

 

2.2  Salmonella isolation and serotyping 

 

 

5 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

 

For the pre-enrichment of Salmonella, 25 g of each food sample was homogenized in 

a sterile bag containing 225 ml bufferred peptone water (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and 

the resulting homogenate was incubated at 37°C for 16 to 20 h. After incubation, 0.1 ml of 

each  culture  sample  was  added  to  10  ml  Rappaport-Vassiliadis  broth  (Merck)  and  further 

incubated at 42°C for 20 to 24 h. A loopful of each culture was streaked onto xylose lysine 

desoxycholate agar (Merck) and Chromagar Salmonella (CHROMagar Microbiology, Paris, 

France),  which  were  then  further  incubated  at  37°C  for  20  to  24  h.  Three  suspected 

Salmonella colonies were streaked onto  Trypticase soy  agar (Merck) and  further incubated 

at 37°C for 18 h. Biochemical characteristics of the isolated colonies were examined using 

triple-sugar  iron  agar  (Merck)  and  lysine  indole  motility  medium  (Nissui  Pharmaceutical 

Co.,  Ltd.,  Tokyo,  Japan).  Isolates  that  showed  biochemical  characteristics  consistent  with 

typical nontyphoidal Salmonella were confirmed by the agglutination test using Salmonella 

O  and  H  antisera  (Denka  Seiken  Ltd.,  Tokyo,  Japan;  SSI  Diagnostica,  Hillerød,  Denmark) 

according to the Kauffmann and White scheme (Grimont and Weill, 2007). 

2.3  Antimicrobial susceptibility testing 

 

All  Salmonella  isolates  were  tested  for  antimicrobial  susceptibility  using  the  disk 

diffusion method, and the results were interpreted according to the standards of the Clinical 

and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, 2013). The antimicrobial disks (BD, Sparks, MD) 

used in the assay contained the following 12 antimicrobial agents:  10 µg ampicillin (AMP), 

30  µg  tetracycline  (TET),  30  µg  kanamycin  (KAN),  30  µg  chloramphenicol  (CHL),  10  µg 

gentamicin  (GEN),  23.75  µg  trimethoprim  and  1.25  µg  sulfamethoxazole  (SXT),  5  µg 

ciprofloxacin (CIP), 30 µg nalidixic acid (NAL), 200 µg fosfomycin (FOF), 30 µg cefoxitin 

 

6 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

(FOX), 30 µg cefotaxime (CTX), and  30 µg ceftazidime (CAZ). The isolates were classified 

as  susceptible,  intermediate,  or  resistant  to  a  particular  antibiotic  based  on  the  size  of  the 

zones of  growth  inhibition  and the criteria of the CLSI. Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was 

used as a quality control organism in this assay. Isolates exhibiting resistance to three or more 

antimicrobial classes were defined as multidrug resistant (MDR). 

Salmonella  isolates  showing  resistance  to  CAZ  or  CTX  were  confirmed  for  ESBL 

production  by  the  double-disk  diffusion  method  (CLSI,  2013)  using  antimicrobial  disks 

containing  30 µg CTX, 30 µg CTX plus 10 µg clavulanic acid, 30 µg CAZ, and  30 µg CAZ 

plus  10  µg  clavulanic  acid.  FOX-resistant  strains  were  classified  as  putative  AmpC-

producing Salmonella (Mataseje et al., 2009). 

 

2.4  PCR detection of β-lactamase genes  

 

The genes responsible for ESBL and AmpC activities in ESBL- and AmpC-producing 

isolates, respectively, were screened using multiplex PCR analyses with the primers shown in 

Table 1 for the detection of blaCTX-M, blaTEM, and blaSHV genes for ESBL (Le et al., 2015) and 

family-specific  plasmid-mediated  ampC  genes  for  AmpC  (Pérez-Pérez  and  Hanson,  2002). 

DNA templates were prepared by boiling bacterial colonies suspended in TE buffer (pH 8.0) 

(Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) for 10 min. PCR was performed using Qiagen Multiplex PCR 

Plus  kits  (Qiagen,  Hilden,  Germany)  according  to  the  manufacturer’s  guidelines.  The  PCR 

program  consisted of  a  denaturation step at 95°C for 5 min, followed by  25 cycles of 95°C 

for 30 s, 60°C for 90 s, and 72°C for 90 s, and a final extension step at 68°C for 10 min. PCR 

products  were  analyzed  by  gel  electrophoresis  using  2%  agarose  (Lonza  Rockland,  Inc., 

Rockland, ME) and a 100-bp DNA ladder (Nacalai Tesque) as a molecular weight marker.

2.5  Sequencing of PCR-amplified β-lactamase genes 

 

PCR  amplicons  of  blaCTX-M-1,  blaCMY,  and  blaTEM  group  genes  were  generated  and 

sequenced using the primers described in Table 1. All PCR products were purified using the 

Illustra  Exo  Pro  Star  kit  (GE  Healthcare  Life  Sciences,  Little  Chalfont,  UK).  Direct 

sequencing  of  PCR  products  was  performed  using  a  BigDye  Terminator  v3.1  Cycle 

Sequencing  Kit  (Applied Biosystems,  Foster  City,  CA)  and  the  same  primers  used  for  the 

initial  PCR.  Sequence  analysis  was  performed  on  an  Applied  Biosystems  3130XL  Genetic 

Analyzer  (Applied Biosystems)  with  HiDi  Formamide  (Applied Biosystems).  The  obtained 

nucleotide  sequences  and  derived  amino  acid  sequences  were  compared  with  previously 

described  sequences  obtained  from  the  GenBank  database  using  the  BLAST  program 

(Altschul et al., 1997). 

 

2.6  PCR detection of monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium 

 

For  4  isolates  identified  as  serotype  O4:i:-  by  the  agglutination  test,  multiplex  PCR 

analysis was performed to differentiate between diphasic S. Typhimurium and monophasic S. 

Typhimurium (mST; serotype 4,5,12:i:-) using the primers of Tennant et al. (2010). Briefly, 

the  primer  set  (H-for  and  Hi)  for  fliC  of  the  Phase  1  flagellar  H:i  antigen  was  used  in 

combination with the primer set for fliB of the Phase 2 flagellar H-1,2 antigen (sense-59 and 

antisense-83)  and  the  fliB-fliA  intergenic  region  of  the  flagellin  gene  cluster  (FFLIB  and 

RFLIA).  The  FFLIB  and  RFLIA  primer  set  amplifies  a  1-kb  region  from  both  S. 

Typhimurium and mST and a 250-bp region from other Salmonella serovars (Echeita et al., 

2001).  The  PCR  conditions  were  the  same  as  those  described  above  for  the  detection  of  β-

lactamase genes.

2.7   Statistical analysis 

 

The prevalence of resistant isolates from each food type were analysed using  Fisher’s 

exact test. For all comparisons, the significance level was set at P < 0.01. 

 

3. Results  

 

3.1. 

Salmonella isolates from food samples 

 

         Among the total of 409 raw meat and seafood samples collected from slaughterhouses, 

wholesale  fish  market  and  retail  markets,  336  Salmonella  isolates  were  obtained  from  228 

samples, corresponding to a prevalence of 55.7% (228/409; Table 2). Of the 228 Salmonella-

positive  samples,  the  highest  prevalence  of  Salmonella  was  detected  in  pork  (69.7%), 

followed  by  poultry  (65.3%),  beef  (58.3%),  shrimp  (49.1%),  and  fish  (36.6%).  Most  of  the 

Salmonella isolates were obtained from pork samples (118 isolates), followed by the beef (77 

isolates), poultry (57 isolates), fish (52 isolates), and shrimp samples (32 isolates). A total of 

53 different Salmonella serovars were identified among the 336 isolates. The highest serovar 

diversity was observed in fish samples (30 serovars), followed by pork (26 serovars), beef (25 

serovars), shrimp (20 serovars), and poultry samples (18 serovars). The five most frequently 

isolated serovars were Rissen (11.3%), Weltevreden (7.1%), London (6.8%), Anatum (6.5%), 

and  Typhimurium  (5.7%).  Salmonella  Weltevreden,  S.  Anatum,  and  S.  Typhimurium  were 

isolated  from  all  of  the  food  types  examined,  whereas  S.  Rissen  was  isolated  mainly  from 

beef and pork samples, and S. London was restricted to meat samples.  

 

9 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

The  most  frequently  isolated  Salmonella  serovars  in  the  beef  samples  were 

Weltevreden (16.9%), Rissen (14.3%), and Anatum (10.4%), and those in pork were Rissen 

(21.2%), London (13.6%), and Anatum (9.3%). In the poultry samples, S. Corvallis was most 

frequently  isolated  (19.3%),  followed  by  S.  Indiana  (10.5%),  S.  Schwarzengrund  (10.5%), 

and S. Typhimunium (10.5%). In the fish samples, no serovars were detected at a rate of more 

than  10%.  In  the  shrimp  samples,  S.  Braenderup  (12.5%)  and  S.  Chester  (12.5%)  were  the 

most frequently isolated, but only 4 isolates of each serover were detected. In the beef, pork, 

and poultry samples, 1 to 2 isolates of mST with serotype 4:i:- were found in each meat type. 

 

3.2.  Antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella isolates 

 

Antimicrobial  susceptibility  testing  of  the  336  Salmonella  isolates  revealed  that  209 

(62.2%) isolates were resistant to at least 1 antimicrobial class and that 138 isolates (41.1%) 

exhibited  a  MDR  phenotype  (Table  3).  The  MDR  strains  were  resistant  to  3  (11.3%),  4 

(19.0%),  5  (7.4%)  and  6  (3.3%)  antimicrobial  classes.  Notably,  S.  Indiana,  mST,  S. 

Schwarzengrund,  S.  Newport,  S.  Bovismorbificans  and  S.  Saintpaul  were  resistant  to  6 

antimicrobial  classes.  All  isolates  of  S.  Indiana  were  resistant  to  at  least  4  classes  of 

antimicrobials,  including  CIP.  The  most  common  resistance  profile  observed  among  the 

MDR  isolates  was  “AMP,  TET,  CHL,  and  SXT”  (43  isolates,  12.8%),  followed  by  “AMP, 

TET, and SXT” and “AMP, TET, CHL, NAL, and SXT” (16 isolates for each profile, 4.8%). 

The antimicrobial resistance profiles of all 336 Salmonella isolates are shown in Table 

4 and Fig. 1. The incidence rate of resistant isolates obtained from pork (74.6%) and poultry 

(89.5%)  was  significantly  higher  than  that  from  the  beef  (41.6%),  fish  (50.0%)  and  shrimp 

(37.5%)  samples  (P  <  0.01).  TET-resistant  isolates  were  the  most  prevalent  (53.3%), 

followed  by  isolates  resistant  to  AMP  (43.8%),  CHL  (37.5%),  SXT  (31.3%),  and  NAL 

 

10 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

(17.5%). GEN-, KAN-, CIP-, CTX-, CAZ-, and FOX-resistant isolates were detected at rates 

below 10%, and FOF resistance was only detected among 0.3% of isolates. The isolates from 

poultry samples showed higher resistance to GEN, CIP, and NAL compared to those from the 

other food types. Although the total  number of isolates was small,  FOF-  and FOX-resistant 

isolates  were  only  detected  in  poultry  samples,  and  CTX-  and  CAZ-resistant  isolates  were 

found in both poultry and fish samples.  

  

3.3.  Confirmation of ESBL and AmpC phenotype 

 

The ability of the 7 CTX- and CAZ-resistant isolates, of which 5 exhibited resistance 

to  FOX,  to  produce  ESBL  and/or  AmpC  was  evaluated  using  the  double-disk  diffusion 

method.  Two  fish  isolates  (S.  Newport  and  S.  Bovismorbificans),  which  had  “AMP,  TET, 

CHL,  GEN,  CTX,  CAZ,  and  SXT”  and  “AMP,  TET,  KAN,  CHL,  GEN,  CTX,  CAZ,  and 

SXT”  resistance  profiles,  respectively,  were  confirmed  to  be  ESBL-producing  Salmonella. 

Multiplex  PCR  analysis  revealed  that  the  2  ESBL-producing  isolates  carried  blaCTX-M1  and 

blaTEM genes. Further sequence analysis of the blaCTX-M1 and blaTEM PCR amplicons indicated 

that  these  isolates  were  CTX-M-55  and  TEM-1  producers.  In  addition,  four  S.  Braenderup 

isolates  a  “AMP,  NAL,  FOX,  CTX,  and  CAZ”  MDR  phenotype  and  one  S.  Typhimurium 

isolate  with  a  “AMP,  TET,  CHL,  FOF,  FOX,  CTX,  and  CAZ”  MDR  phenotype  were 

confirmed  to  be  AmpC  producers.  The  results  of  PCR  and  sequence  analyses  showed  that 

these isolates may produce CMY-2.

Discussion

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

In  this  study,  we  surveyed  the  rate  of  Salmonella  contamination  in  raw  meat  and 

seafood samples obtained from slaughter houses, and wholesale and retail markets in HCMC, 

Vietnam and found that pork and beef samples had high levels of Salmonella contamination 

(69.7%  and  58.3%,  respectively).  Although  these  rates  were  similar  to  those  previously 

reported  for  pork  and  beef  samples  collected  in  HCMC  (Van  et  al.,  2007)  and  the  Mekong 

Delta, Vietnam (Phan et al. 2005), the Salmonella contamination rates were markedly higher 

than those found in Egypt (18.5% for beef products; Sallam et al., 2014), Ethiopia (14.4% for 

minced beef and 16.4% for pork; Ejeta et al., 2004), and the United Kingdom (3.9% for pork 

and  1.39%  for  beef;  Little  et  al.,  2008).  In  addition,  the  rate  of  Salmonella  contamination 

found in poultry (65.3%) and shrimp (49.1%) was also higher than that reported in previous 

domestic studies for poultry (21.0% to 53.3%; Huong et al., 2006; Phan et al., 2005; Ta et al., 

2014; Van et al., 2007) and shrimp (18.0% to 24.5%; Phan et al., 2005; Van et al., 2007), and 

in  other  developing  countries,  such  as  Iran  (shrimp,  13.4%;  Sana,  2012)  and  Bangladesh 

(shrimp,  5.71%;  Hossain  et  al.,  2013),  as  well  as  developed  countries,  including  the  United 

States (shrimp, 1.6%; Koonse et al., 2005) and Italy (shrimp, 0.6%; Busani et al., 2005).  

Among the 25 different types of Salmonella serovars detected in the beef samples, 17 

serovars were also found in the pork samples, although the prevalence rates differed between 

the  two  meat  types.  Because  beef  and  pork  were  generally  sliced  and  packaged  using  the 

same  procedures  and  equipment  in  the  sampled  retail  stores,  cross-contamination  between 

pork  and  beef  products  likely  occured  at  retail  stores,  including  supermarkets.  The  most 

common serovars detected  in  the beef and pork  samples were S. Weltevreden,  S. Rissen,  S. 

Anatum, and S. London. S. Weltevreden is the fourth most common human serotype in Asia, 

and  S.  Anatum  and  S.  Rissen  are  two  of  the  most  common  non-human  serotypes  in  Asia 

(Galanis et al., 2006). In the poultry samples, S. Corvallis, S. Indiana, and S. Enteritidis were 

frequently isolated; however, these serovars differed from those found previously in poultry

samples  in  Vietnam  (Phan  et  al.,  2005;  Ta  et  al.,  2014;  Thai  et  al.,  2012b),  likely  due  to 

differences in the sampling locations and timing. In the fish and shrimp samples, the serovar 

distribution was uniform, and with the exception of S. Give, S. Corvallis, and S. Kiambu, all 

serovars  isolated  from  the  seafood  samples  were  consistent  with  those  found  in  fish  and 

fishery  products  in  India  and  Southeast  Asia  (FAO,  2010).  In  addition,  several  distinctive 

serovars,  such  as  S.  Potsdam,  S.  Bareilly,  S.  Chester,  and  S.  Wandsworth,  were  detected, 

suggesting  that  these  serovars  might  be  seafood-specific  in  HCMC,  Vietnam.  These  results 

also  suggest  that  meat  and  seafood  products  might  have  different  sources  of  Salmonella 

contamination within the food distribution system of HCMC.  

Several Salmonella serovars, including S. Typhimurium and S. Anatum, were isolated 

in  all  of  the  examined  food  types.  In  Vietnam,  the  goverment  has  encouraged  the 

establishment  of  an  integrated  agriculture-aquaculture  farming  system,  known  as  the 

Vegetation,  Aquaculture,  and  Cage  (VAC)  system,  in  which  the  waste  generated  from 

livestock is used as a nutrient source for aquaculture ponds and crop production (Hoa et al., 

2011; Pham et al., 2013). Thus, in VAC systems, it is possible that Salmonella serovars can 

be  spread  from  livestock  to  aquaculture  and  vegetable  cultivation  areas.  Here,  S. 

Typhimurium was frequently isolated from pork, poultry, and fish samples, a finding that is 

consistent  with  two  previous  studies  in  Vietnam  in  which  S.  Typhimurium  was  the  most 

common serovar isolated from humans (Vo et al., 2006; Vo et al., 2010). The present results 

suggest  that  pork,  poultry,  and  fish  may  be  sources  of  S.  Typhimurium  salmonellosis  in 

HCMC, Vietnam.  

During  the  last  20  years,  mST  with  the  antigenic  structure  1,4,[5],12:i:-  has  been 

detected  in  foodborne  outbreaks  in  many  European  countries,  including  France,  Germany, 

and  Austria  (EFSA,  2010).  In  Vietnam,  mST  has  been  isolated  from  the  feces  of  pig, 

chicken,  and  duck  (Lettini  et  al.,  2016;  Tu  et  al.,  2015).  We  showed  here  that  mST  was 

 

13 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

 

present  in retail meat products and was resistant to  as many as  6 classes of  antimicrobials, 

suggesting that the spread of MDR mST should be closely monitored in HCMC, Vietnam. 

We  performed  antimicrobial  susceptibility  testing  to  investigate  drug  resistance 

among  the  Salmonella  isolates  according  to  clinical  standards.  The  prevalence  rates  of 

antimicrobial-resistant  Salmonella in the meat  and fish sampled in HCMC, South  Vietnam 

were high (62.2%) and were similar to that previously reported in samples collected in North 

Vietnam (66.0%; Thai et al., 2012c). Moreover, MDR isolates, which were resistant to three 

or more classes of antimicrobials, were found at a rate of 41.1%. Notably, the most common 

antimicrobial  resistance  profile  of  the  MDR  isolates  was  “AMP,  TET,  CHL,  and  SXT” 

resistance,  which  is  similar  to  that  previously  reported  for  Salmonella  isolates  from 

derivatives of food-producing animals in Vietnam (Lettini et al., 2016; Ta et al., 2014; Thai 

et  al.,  2012b;  Thai  and  Yamaguchi,  2012; Tu  et  al.,  2015),  Mexico (Miranda  et  al.,  2009), 

and Thailand (Pulsrikarn et  al.,  2012).  In Vietnam, AMP, CHL, TET,  and  SXT are widely 

used for the treatment of diarrhea (Nguyen et al., 2005) and invasive Salmonella infection in 

humans (Crump et al., 2011), and are also used in veterinary medicine (Carrique-Mas et al., 

2014; Nhiem et al., 2006; Pham et al., 2013; Pham et al., 2015; Thai et al., 2012b). Based on 

the  high  rates  of  resistance  to  these  antibiotics  by  the  Salmonella  isolates  detected  in  this 

study, the use of these and any other antimicrobial agents should be restricted to avoid the 

further spread of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella in Vietnam. 

The  Salmonella  isolates  from  poultry  had  significantly  higher  resistance  (42.1%)  to 

NAL than those from the other food types (9.1%-14.7%; P < 0.01), as was reported in other 

domestic  studies  (Ogasawara  et  al.,  2008;  Thai  et  al.,  2012c;  Van  et  al.,  2007).  This  high 

resistance  rate  may  be  attributable  to  the  unregulated  usage  of  quinolones  in  poultry  in 

Vietnam (Carrique-Mas et al., 2014). We also detected CIP-resistant Salmonella in 21.1% of 

the poultry samples and in 4.7% of the beef, pork, poultry, fish, and shrimp samples. CIP-

14

resistant Salmonella isolates were not previously found in samples from foods, animals,  or 

humans  in  Vietnam  (Ogasawara  et  al.,  2008;  Van  et  al.,  2007),  and  were  only  detected  in 

3.5% of chicken meat (Ta et al., 2014). However, the present findings, and those of Lettini et 

al. (2016), who detected CIP-resistant Salmonella isolates in 54.2% of poultry and 62.7% of 

pig  fecal  and  dust  samples  collected  from  farms  in  Central  Vietnam,  suggest  that  CIP-

resistant isolates are increasing in retail poultry in Vietnam. Notably, 7 S. Indiana isolates (1 

from fish and 6 from poultry), displayed MDR to up 6 antimicrobial classes, including CIP. 

We  also  detected  ESBL-producing  E.  coli  isolates  in  the  food  samples,  and  found  that  the 

isolates  from  poultry  had  a  higher  rate  of  resistance  to  CIP  (80.5%)  than  the  other  food 

isolates (39.5%-68.2%) (Nguyen et al., 2016). Because the major metabolite of enrofloxacin 

is  CIP  (Devreese  et  al.,  2014),  and  enrofloxacin  was  detected  in  the  majority  of  poultry 

samples  in  HCMC  (Yamaguchi  et  al.,  2015),  the  present  findings  suggest  that  the  overuse 

and misuse of enrofloxacin in chickens might promote the acquisition of resistance to CIP. 

As CIP is the drug of choice for the treatment of human Salmonella infections (Thai et al., 

2012a), the spread of CIP-resistant Salmonella in HCMC, Vietnam should be monitored and 

the use should be limited. 

Among the Salmonella serovars detected in the present fish samples,  2 isolates of S. 

Bovismorbificans  and  S.  Newport  that  produced  CTX-M-55  β-lactamase  were  identified. 

Human Salmonella isolates producing CTX-M-55 ESBL are rarely detected in China (Yu et 

al., 2011), USA (Sjölund-Karlsson et al., 2011), and Japan (Imoto et al., 2014), although the 

blaCTX-M-55  gene  has  been  frequently  detected  in  ESBL-producing  Enterobacteriaceae 

obtained from animal specimens in Asia (Santos et al., 2013), nosocomial infection patients 

in  HCMC  (Trang  et  al.,  2013),  and  vegetables  imported  to  Switzerland  from  Vietnam 

(Zurfluh  et  al.,  2015).  S.  Braenderup  and  S.  Typhimurium  isolates  that  produced  CMY-2 

AmpC β-lactamase were also detected in the present poultry samples. CMY-2-producing S. 

15 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

Typhimurium  has  been  found  in  retail  chicken  in  Pennsylvania,  USA  (M'ikanatha  et  al., 

2010) and diarrheic pigs in Korea (Lee et al., 2014), and CMY-2-producing S. Braenderup 

was detected in humans in Taiwan (Chiou et al., 2009). Additionally, the blaCMY-2 gene was 

detected  in  Enterobacteriaceae  from  humans  in  Vietnam  (Sheng  et  al.,  2013).  The  present 

results  suggest  that  the  prevalence  of  CTX-M-55-  and  CMY-2-producing  Salmonella  has 

increased in raw foods in HCMC, Vietnam, likely due to the horizontal transfer of blaCTX-M-

55 and blaCMY-2 genes, which are located on a transferable plasmid (Jacoby, 2009; Trang et 

al.,  2013), between  Salmonella or other species, as  was  reported by Winokur et  al.  (2001). 

The appearance of these strains may be attributable to the use of the integrated VAC system 

in  Vietnam,  as  described  above,  in  which  antimicrobials  released  from  animal  and  human 

origins  may  promote  the  development  of  antimicrobial-resistant  bacteria  through  the 

horizontal transfer of resistance genes (Hoa et al., 2011; Pham et al., 2013). 

In conclusion, this study revealed that MDR Salmonella is widely disseminated in raw 

meats  and  seafood  within  the  food  distribution  system  of  HCMC,  Vietnam.  To  our 

knowledge,  this  is  the  first  reported  isolation  of  ESBL-  and  AmpC-producing  Salmonella 

from foods, including fish, in Vietnam. These findings may provide valuable information for 

developing  future  Salmonella  surveillance  systems,  as  well  as  for  guiding  antimicrobial 

usage in both humans and animals in Vietnam.

Title: Prevalence and Antibiotic Resistance of Salmonella Isolates from Raw Meat and Seafood 
Samples in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam 

 

 

Highlights 

  A total of 336 Salmonella strains were isolated from 409 raw food samples in Vietnam. 
  High  Salmonella  contamination  rates  were  detected  in  both  meat  (65%)  and  seafood  (41%) 

products. 

  Resistance to one or more antimicrobials was found in 89.5% of Salmonella strains from poultry. 
  Multidrug resistance was observed in 138 (41.1%) strains of Salmonella. 
  Two ESBL- and five AmpC-producers were found in fish and poultry, respectively.
