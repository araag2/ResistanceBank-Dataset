ABSTRACT The spread of colistin resistance gene mcr-1 at the animal-human inter-
face remains largely unknown. This work aimed to investigate the molecular charac-
two extended-spectrum-␤-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli
teristics of
strains with mcr-1, i.e., strains H8 and H9, isolated from the same mink farmer. In
this study, ﬁve mcr-positive E. coli strains were isolated from the mink farm. Pulsed-
ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) identiﬁed
two genetically unrelated MCR-1 producers (H8 and H9) from the same farmer and
two clonally related MCR-1-positive isolates (M5 and M6) from two different mink
samples. Additionally, a mcr-1 variant, designated mcr-1.12, was identiﬁed in isolate
M4. MIC determination revealed that all of the MCR-producing strains exhibited mul-
tiresistant phenotypes but showed susceptibility to imipenem, meropenem, amika-
cin, and tigecycline. Replicon typing showed that mcr-1 was associated with IncHI2
plasmids in 4 cases, while the gene was located on an IncI2 plasmid in 1 case.
PacBio sequencing and plasmid analysis conﬁrmed that the mcr-1 gene was located
on an ⬃204-kb IncHI2 plasmid in H8 and was carried by an ⬃61-kb IncI2 plasmid in
H9. To our knowledge, this work represents the ﬁrst report of the occurrence of
MCR-producing isolates from mink. Moreover, our report also describes the coexis-
tence of two different MCR-1 producers in the same farmer. It highlights that fur
farms can be reservoirs of mcr-1 genes. The identiﬁcation of mcr-carrying plasmids
on a fur farm is of potential public health importance, as it suggests that mcr is
widespread in the animal husbandry industry.

IMPORTANCE Colistin resistance is a real threat for both human and animal
health. The mobile colistin resistance gene mcr has contributed to the persis-
tence and transmission of colistin resistance at the interfaces of animals, hu-
mans, and ecosystems. Although mcr genes have usually been recovered from
food animals, patients, and healthy humans, transmission of mcr genes at the
animal-human interface remains largely unknown. This was the ﬁrst study to iso-
late and characterize MCR-producing isolates from mink, as well as to report the
coexistence of two different MCR-1 producers in the same farmer. The character-
ization and analysis of two MCR-1-producing E. coli isolates may have important
implications for comprehension of the transmission dynamics of these bacteria.
We emphasize the importance of improved multisectorial surveillance of colistin-
resistant E. coli in this region.

Colistin is one of the most critically important antimicrobials and is considered a

drug of last resort for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant
pathogens. The transmissible colistin resistance gene mcr-1 was ﬁrst discovered in food
animals and humans in 2015 (1). Since then, this gene has been detected in pets, wild
birds, and environmental samples from various sources (2). Interestingly, a previous
study reported the possibility that extended-spectrum ␤-lactamases (ESBLs), carbap-
enemase enzymes, and MCR-1 have coexisted since the 1980s (3). The cooccurrence of
carbapenemase genes or ESBL genes and mcr-1 in the same isolate is of concern
because it has the potential to lead to pan-drug resistance (4).

Previous studies have conﬁrmed the spread of mcr genes mainly via epidemic
plasmids (IncI2, IncHI2, IncP, IncX4, IncFI, and IncFIB) of various sizes (58 to 251 kb) (5).
The acquisition of the mcr-1 gene has been investigated extensively, and diverse
genetic contexts surrounding mcr-1 genes have been discovered (6). However, com-
prehensive information regarding the prevalence of mcr-1 in isolates from fur-bearing
animals and the spread of colistin resistance at the animal-human interface remains
limited.

We performed a survey of fecal isolates from two adjacent farms (a fur farm and a
household farm) located in Shandong Province, China, in June 2016. A total of 20
samples from fur animals, 10 from chicken, 5 from pigs, and 10 from farmers were
collected. One fecal sample was collected from each farmer and animal. Fecal samples
were collected using sterile swabs and stored in sterile tubes. Subsequently, samples
were placed on ice, transported to the laboratory, and processed within 24 h after
collection.

Fecal samples were cultured on MacConkey agar plates supplemented with 2 mg/
liter cefotaxime at 37°C for 24 h under aerobic conditions to recover potential ESBL-
producing isolates. The MICs were determined by the agar dilution method and
interpreted according to CLSI standards (7), and EUCAST breakpoints for tigecycline,
colistin, and polymyxin B were applied. Escherichia coli strain ATCC 25922 was used as
a quality control.

Each isolate was tested for the presence of genes encoding ESBLs (8, 9) and MCR
variants via PCR and sequencing (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). The clonal
relatedness of the E. coli isolates was assessed using pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis
(PFGE) (8) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) (http://enterobase.warwick.ac.uk/
species/ecoli/allele_st_search).

MCR-positive isolates were characterized by conjugation experiments to assess their
ability to transfer colistin resistance (10). Plasmid sizes were determined using S1-PFGE
and Southern blotting methods as previously described (8). The identiﬁcation of the
plasmid incompatibility (Inc) group replicon types was performed by multiplex PCR, as
described previously (11). The circular image representing comparisons of multiple
plasmids was generated by the BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG) (12).

Genomic DNA was extracted using an Omega bacterial DNA kit (Omega Bio-tek,
Norcross, CA, USA). Illumina sequencing was performed on MCR-1 variant isolate M4
and on MCR-1-producing isolates from the same farmer (H8 and H9) with the HiSeq
4000-PE150 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Illumina sequencing libraries were
prepared using standardized protocols (6, 13). To obtain the complete sequences of
pMCR-H8 and pMCR-H9, isolates H8 and H9 were further subjected to single-molecule
real-time (SMRT) DNA sequencing on a PacBio RS II platform (Paciﬁc Biosciences, CA,
USA). The complete genome sequences for E. coli H8 and H9 were created by com-
bining Illumina sequencing reads with PacBio sequencing reads, using Unicycler (14).
PlasmidSPAdes was used to produce plasmid sequences from whole-genome-
sequencing (WGS) data (http://spades.bioinf.spbau.ru/plasmidSPAdes/). Additionally, in
silico sequence analyses of multilocus sequencing typing (MLST) data, antimicrobial
resistance genes, and plasmid replicon typing were performed using online tools
(http://www.genomicepidemiology.org/).

Overall, 20 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were identiﬁed from human and animal
fecal samples (Fig. 1). We detected blaCTX-M genes in all isolates, including blaCTX-M-14

FIG 1 Summary of the molecular epidemiological characteristics of ESBL-producing E. coli strains identiﬁed from adjacent farms in China, 2016. The
dendrogram of PFGE patterns was constructed using BioNumerics v6.6 with unweighted pair group method using average linkages (UPGMA) clustering. AMK,
amikacin; CFZ, cefazolin; CIP, ciproﬂoxacin; CST, colistin; CXM, cefuroxime; FOX, cefoxitin; GEN, gentamicin; IMP, imipenem; MEM, meropenem; PMB, polymyxin
B; PTZ, piperacillin-tazobactam; TET, tetracycline; TGC, tigecycline; ESBL, extended-spectrum ␤-lactamase; Neg, negative; Pos, positive. MICs were determined
according to CLSI standards. The EUCAST breakpoints for tigecycline, colistin, and polymyxin B were applied.

(n ⫽ 10), blaCTX-M-65 (n ⫽ 4), and blaCTX-M-54 (n ⫽ 1). The remaining ESBL isolates be-
longed to the blaCTX-M-55 group (n ⫽ 5). We further identiﬁed 5 (22.7%) mcr-positive E.
coli isolates from the fur farm (Fig. 1). Among them, 3 were isolated from mink samples,
while the remaining 2 were detected in the same farmer. DNA sequencing revealed that
four isolates carried the mcr-1 gene, while isolate M4 harbored a new mcr variant. The
mcr-1.12 gene, as designated here, carries a missense mutation at position 48 (T¡G),
which results in a Phe16-to-Leu substitution. MIC determination revealed that all of the
MCR-producing strains exhibited multiresistant phenotypes but showed susceptibility
to imipenem, meropenem, amikacin, and tigecycline (Fig. 1).

Genetic diversity was observed in the PFGE proﬁles, and no obvious major pulso-
types were found via PFGE analysis. Isolates H2 and H3, isolates M5 and M6, and isolates
H2 and H3 shared high homology, respectively (Fig. 1). MLST of the 20 E. coli isolates
identiﬁed 15 unique sequence types (STs). ST10 (n ⫽ 3) was the predominant ST among
the isolates, with all ST10 isolates being recovered from farm workers (Fig. 1). Four
different STs were detected among the 5 E. coli isolates carrying mcr genes. Of note,
two MCR-1-positive isolates (H8 and H9) from the same fur animal farm worker
belonged to ST101 and ST6390, respectively. Transconjugation experiments, replicon
typing, and S1-PFGE demonstrated the cooccurrence of mcr-1 and blaCTX-M-9 group
genes on the three IncHI2 plasmids (pMCR-M4, pMCR-M5, and pMCR-M6) of ⬃218 kb
and one IncHI2 plasmid (pMCR-H8) of ⬃206 kb (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental
material). Transconjugants from H8 isolates exhibited elevated colistin, ampicillin,
cefazolin, and ceftriaxone MICs; by contrast, transconjugants from H9 showed elevated
colistin MICs only (Table S2).

The complete sequence of pMCR-H8 harboring the mcr-1 gene was 203,941 bp

(Fig. 2A; see also Table S3). Plasmid comparisons based on full-plasmid BLAST query
revealed that pMCR-H8 was closely related to plasmid pHNSHP45-2 (GenBank no.
KU341381), which was described in the original report of the discovery of mcr-1 (15).
Annotations showed that pMCR-H8 also carried genes conferring resistance to crucially
important antibiotics for human treatment, including cephalosporin (blaCTX-M-14), ﬂo-
rfenicol (ﬂoR), fosfomycin (fosA3), and quinolone (oqxAB ) (Fig. 2A; see also Table S3). In
contrast, pMCR-H9 was found to be a 60,942-bp IncI2 plasmid. The overall structure of
pMCR-H9 was identical to that of various IncI2-type plasmids (Fig. 2B),
including
pJIE3685-1, identiﬁed from a human urine E. coli isolate collected in Australia (16), and
pColR598_2, recovered from a human isolate collected in Switzerland (17). Interestingly,
pMCR-H8 and pMCR-M4 exhibited low sequence identity (Fig. 2A), although they are
similar in size (Fig. S1). These results suggest the genetic diversity of mcr-1-carrying
plasmids from mink and human origin and the ﬂexibility of mcr-1 transmission between
animal and human.

In this work, the mcr-1 gene was found in three genetic contexts, including mcr-1
pap2 , ISApl1 mcr-1 pap2, and ISApl1 mcr-1 pap2 ISApl1. The complete sequence of
pMCR-H8 revealed the presence of ISApl1 mcr-1 pap2, while ISApl1 was absent in
pMCR-H9 (Fig. 2). We further identiﬁed an IncHI2 plasmid contig carrying the mcr-1.12
gene from isolate M4 using the plasmidSPAdes assembler with high coverage. Query-
ing this ⬃43-kb-length contig against the NCBI nr/nt sequence database revealed 100%
sequence homology to annotated mcr-1-positive IncHI2 plasmid pHNSHP45-2 (Gen-
Bank: KU341381 ) (Fig. 2A). A typical structure surrounding the mcr-1 gene (ISApl1
mcr-1.12 pap2 ISApl1) was observed in the plasmid contig (Fig. S2).

Previous studies have shown that farm workers have a higher rate of carriage of
ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli than the general population (18). The cooccurrence of
two different MCR-1-producing isolates in the same farmer indicates that individuals in
direct contact with minks are at potential risk for carrying MCR-1 producers, although
the magnitude of this risk remains to be elucidated.

Colistin is widespread used in animals but rarely used on mink breeding farms in
China (1, 19). Our retrospective questionnaire also revealed that only ﬂavomycin was
used for growth promotion on the fur farm, while no history of usage of polymyxins
was reported from the farmers. Recently, Wu et al. reported the rapid rise in carriage of
the ESBL and mcr-1 genes in E. coli of chicken origin in Shandong Province (20).
Previous investigations also found that MCR variants were widespread among samples
from farmers (21, 22). We hypothesized that the introduction of mcr-1-positive bacteria
in fur farms had occurred via the food chain-based dissemination pathway, since the
farmer reported the breed history of mink fed with chicken bones. Thus far, only limited
reports have described the patterns of antimicrobial use and antimicrobial-resistant
bacteria among mink (23, 24). The epidemiology of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria
among mink and farm workers is largely unknown. Therefore, a “One Health” strategy
for preventing the spread of colistin resistance at the human-mink-environment inter-
face is essential.

The major types of mcr-1-carrying plasmids, including IncI2, IncHI2, IncX4, IncP, IncFI,
and IncFIB plasmids of various sizes, have been identiﬁed in E. coli isolates from diverse
hosts (5). In fact, mcr-1-carrying IncHI2/IncI2 plasmids were frequently identiﬁed from
animal, human, and environmental samples in China (20, 25). Our data further con-
ﬁrmed that similar IncHI2 and IncI2 plasmids carrying mcr-1 gene are prevalent in
various sources in China.

In summary, we describe the emergence of MCR-1 producers in mink and the
coexistence of two different MCR-1-producing E. coli
isolates in the same farmer.
Notwithstanding the limitations of this work, our ﬁndings indicate that mcr-1-carrying
IncHI2/IncI2 plasmids are widely disseminated in China. Additional studies involving
more fur animals and farm workers are urgently needed to assess the dissemination
dynamics of mcr genes.
