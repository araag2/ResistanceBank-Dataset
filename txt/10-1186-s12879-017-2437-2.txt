Abstract

Background: Ethiopia set an ambitious masterplan to increase chicken meat and egg production from 2015 to
2020. Poultry breeding, multiplication and distribution centers in the country have received executive order to
import, amplify and distribute commercial chickens to end users. The biosecurity and the pathogen fauna of the
centers have not been evaluated as to whether the centers could implement the mission effectively without any
risk. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the biosecurity practices and the pathogen prevalence, risk factors
and their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) using Salmonella as case study.
Methods: Routine farm workers of the centers were interviewed about the different management (biosecurity)
practices using a checklist. Samples (n = 270) from different sources consisting of chicken’s cloacal swab (n = 244),
personnel hand swab (n = 9) and bedding (n = 17) were collected from three chicken multiplication centers.
Standard bacteriological methods were used for the isolation of Salmonella. Disk diffusion method was used for
drug sensitivity testing.
Results: Antimicrobials were often over prescribed without confirming the cause of ill health and without
susceptibility testing. The general biosecurity and flock management practices were substandard. Salmonella was
isolated from 45 (16.7%) of the 270 samples. Its prevalence was significantly (p<0.05) associated with location of the
multiplication center, 27% at Bonga and 10.6% at Hawassa. Sample type was also significantly (p<0.05) affected in
that it was higher in the bedding (35.3%) and personnel hand swabs (33.3%) than in the chicken cloaca (14.8%),
which demonstrates the poor biosecurity and personnel hygienic practices in the centers. All of the 45 isolates
(100%) exhibited resistance to kanamycin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, nalidixic acid (97.8%), ampicillin
(97.8%), cefoxitin (97.8%), streptomycin (97.8%) tetracycline (97.8%), chloramphenicol (91.3%), ciprofloxacin (31.1%),
and gentamicin (0%). Alarmingly, 42 isolates (93.4%) exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR) to ≥ 8 drugs and all 45
isolates had resistance to ≥ 3 drugs. The high rate of Salmonella isolation from (i) bedding, (ii) personnel hand swabs
(iii) chickens, (iv) presence of more MDR isolates, (v) coupled with poor biosecurity practices in the centers could pose
a risk for spreading of pathogens and drug resistant genes to the smallholder chicken producers and the public.

Conclusions: We conclude that the poultry breeding, multiplication and distribution centers in Ethiopia, as they stand
currently, seem to be a source of pathogens and AMR isolates at least for Salmonella. Therefore, strict biosecurity,
personnel safety, prudent drug use, regular monitoring and traceability of Salmonella serotypes or genotypes and AMR
are recommended.

Background
Ethiopia has about 56.87 million chickens comprising
mainly indigenous chickens, with the majority (95%)
kept in low-input low-out-put village chicken production
systems [1, 2]. Chicken provides an important source of
income in addition to offering eggs and meat for the
poor smallholder households [1]. However, the 0.5 kg
annual per capita egg consumption in Ethiopia is five
times lower than the average 2.3 kg per capita for other
sub-Sahara African countries [3]. The Ethiopian indigen-
ous chickens cannot be produced and fill the national
demand for chicken meat and eggs despite the fact that
they harbor suitable phenotypic traits for ecological, so-
cial and cultural context of Ethiopia [1, 4]. Rhode Island
Red, Australorp, New Hampshire and White Leghorns
chickens were imported to Haromaya, Jimma, Bishoftu
and Shashemene in 1950s [5]. This led to the establish-
ment of modern poultry farms in 1959 able to distrib-
ute commercial chickens to urban producers. Shortly
thereafter, seven poultry multiplication and distribution
centers were established in different locations under
the Ministry of Agriculture to distribute commercial
chickens [6]. Although Ethiopia started utilization of
imported high producing commercial chicken’s years
ago, the supply to fill the demand has never been met,
even though the number of multiplication centers has
increased to 15 [7]. Poultry multiplication centers are
defined as those government owned centers engaged in
importation of improved commercial chickens from de-
veloped countries, rear, multiply and distribute chicks
of mostly up to 3 month old all over the country. The
centers are not for profit as chicks are sold with around
50% below real market prices unlike the private com-
mercial poultry farms [7]. However, the poultry sub-
sector has remained at subsistence level. The national
demand for chicken products remains still under-met,
and hence malnutrition and poverty is widespread.
Thus, Ethiopia has launched recently a master plan for
livestock development. The plan aims
to increase
chicken meat production by 247% and egg production
by 827% in five years, 2020 [8].

Improved commercial

laying hens, which produce
about 325 eggs per year and broilers that can reach
2.5 kg in 42 days with high feed efficiency and product
quality are available elsewhere [9]. These animals are

targeted for
importation and incorporation in the
current Ethiopian livestock development master plan
based on preliminary experiences on these animals in
the country [10–12].

In Ethiopia, farm hygiene, biosecurity, diagnostic cap-
abilities, monitoring, tracing and notification of patho-
gens and AMR at the farm and national level are not
well developed [7, 13] and uncontrolled antimicrobial
use and misuse is common [14]. Thus, the burden of
pathogens in poultry multiplication centers is poorly
known in Ethiopia, which may entail risk of distributing
infected chickens unless appropriately handled.

One of the major pathogens devastating the poultry
industry is Salmonella [15]. Salmonellosis causes severe
economic damage to chicken production by reducing
production, 100% morbidity, and 20% mortality in
affected flocks [15]. Furthermore, the vertical and hori-
zontal transmission ability of Salmonella complicates the
spread and control of the disease; hence, it remains a
problem on the farm for prolonged time [16]. Salmon-
ella is also known as one of the major food-borne
zoonotic pathogens. In United State, it is responsible for
1.4 million cases of human illness, 20,000 hospitaliza-
tions and over 500 deaths annually [17]. The ability of
Salmonella to acquire antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is
another capability of this pathogen rendering it difficult
to eliminate. The emergence and spread of such resistant
strains among food animals is life threatening and a
global public health concern, as they are often non-
treatable with currently available antimicrobials [18].
Animal agriculture such as poultry farming and anti-
biotic usage on the farms are a hot debate topic, be-
cause the overuse may be a contributing factor for the
entrance of AMR pathogens and AMR genes to the
food chain [19]. Thus, Salmonella in poultry remains a
political issue due to its impact on food production, ani-
mal welfare, public health and antimicrobial resistance.

A study in northern Ethiopia reported that the preva-
lence of Salmonella in the local and commercial breeds
was 39.3% and 29.2%, respectively [20], 42.7% in indoor
chickens and 40.8% in free ranging in western Oromia at
Jimma [21]. The limited studies have reported the pres-
ence of multidrug resistant Salmonella strains in chicken
farms [22, 23], which cannot be killed by antimicrobials
and hence increase the morbidity, mortality and costs

conducted on
Salmonella in Ethiopia are scarce. It is difficult to under-
stand the real picture in the country because of the
diverse chicken population growing in the different
agro-ecologies of the country [1, 4]. Considerable differ-
ences in level of susceptibility to Salmonella have been
reported among different chicken breeds [24]. Moreover,
controlling Salmonella in poultry operations is compli-
cated because there are numerous potential sources of
contamination,
rodents, wild
birds, equipment and personnel in the poultry process-
ing plant [25] as well as hatcheries [26]. One of the key
areas for controlling Salmonella is to know its source
and dissemination pathways. Ethiopia has developed
research-extension programs that
to transfer
improved technology packages from agricultural re-
search centers (e.g. commercial chicken breeding, multi-
plication and distribution centers) to end users [27].
However, little is known about where Salmonella estab-
lishes at the poultry breeding, multiplication and/or
distribution centers in Ethiopia. Therefore, the aim of
this study was to (i) identify poor farm practices in bio-
security that trigger pathogen flare-ups, (ii) determine
the prevalence and (iii) AMR patterns of Salmonella
isolates in three poultry breeding, multiplication and
distribution centers in Southern Ethiopia.

Methods
Description of study areas
This study was conducted in Hawassa and Bonga,
Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region
(SNNPR), from November 2014 to May 2015. Hawassa
is the capital of the SNNPR and is located at 275 km
south of Addis Ababa. The
and
temperature of
from 800 mm to
1000 mm and 20 °C to 25 °C, respectively. Bonga is an
administrative city for Kaffa zone and is situated at
460 km south-west of Addis Ababa. The mean annual
rainfall in the area is about 1710 mm, and the monthly
temperature varies from 18 °C to 21 °C [2, 28].

Study design and samples
A cross-sectional study was used, and sampling was con-
ducted only once. Of four poultry multiplication centers
in SNNPR, two (i.e. Bonga and Hawassa centers) were
randomly selected. White leg horn breed was reared at
both Bonga and Hawassa multiplication centers. Bonga
Poultry Multiplication Center
is mandated
mainly to distribute improved commercial chickens to
zones in the south and western part of the region, such
as Kaffa, Shaka and Bench Maji zones. Hawassa Poultry
Multiplication Center
(HPMC) serves zones in the
northeastern of the region. In addition, one commercial
farm for Bovans brown breed was
included from

(BPMC)

Hawassa for comparison. The Bonga center had three
houses for layer and eight houses for growers. HPMC
had 12 houses for layers and 4 houses for growers and
chicks. Hawassa commercial farm had houses for layers
alone. These multiplication centers disseminate growers
and chicks of white leghorn and brown Bovans breeds
for producers and farmers. The average number of
chickens per house was 1000.

The minimum required sample size was calculated
based on an expected prevalence of 15.4% [23] with 95%
desired confidence interval and 5% absolute precision
using the formula described in Thrusfield et al. [29].
Accordingly, 270 chickens (100 from BPMC, 90 from
HPMC and 80 from Hawassa commercial farm) were
sampled. In addition, environmental (bedding) samples
were collected from these farms. Hand swabs of six
personnel working in the poultry houses were sampled
from Hawassa multiplication center and three from
Bonga. The personnel were healthy and had no symp-
toms of infection. Human samples were collected based
on an ethical approval (Ref. RD/LT/194/2013) and sam-
pled based on their consent. The aim of hand swabbing
was to evaluate the hygiene and biosecurity practices of
workers in order to use the results as a risk indicator for
the development of zoonoses and involvement of the
workers in the dissemination of the pathogens on the
farm(s). Along with the hand swab samples, farm atten-
dants were interviewed in relation to the routine man-
agement practices of the multiplication centers and farm
that could be risk factors for salmonellosis.

Sampling and sample transportation
A sterile cotton tipped swab (2 × 3 cm) was first soaked
in approximately 10 mL buffered peptone water (BPW,
Oxoid Ltd., England). Then cloacal/fecal samples were
collected using the pre-moistened swab. In addition,
both sides of the right and left hands of farm attendants
were rubbed using pre-soaked swab. Each swab sample
was placed in a separate universal bottle with 4 mL
BPW. The wooden shaft was broken off; and the cotton
swab was left inside the bottle. The swab samples were
taken according to the method described in ISO-17604
(2003) [30]. The collected samples were transported in ice-
box to the Laboratory of Microbiology in College of Veter-
inary Medicine and Agriculture, Addis Ababa University.

Bacteriological isolation and identification
The isolation was performed using the conventional bac-
teriological methods for the detection of Salmonella
standard guidelines [31]. The bacteriological culture
media and biochemical tests were prepared according to
manufacturer’s recommendations.

Non-selective pre-enrichment
The swab samples were pre-enriched in BPW in the ra-
tio of one to nine (i.e. 25 mL of the sample was inocu-
lated into 225 mL of BPW) and incubated at 37 °C for
24 h.

Selective enrichment
Rappaport-Vassiliadis medium (RV, Oxoid Ltd., England)
broth and Müller Kauffman Tetrathionate (MKTT,
Oxoid Ltd., England) broth were used for selective en-
richment of the samples. From the pre-enriched sample,
0.1 mL was transferred into a tube containing 10 mL of
RV broth and incubated at 42 °C for 24 h. Another
1 mL was transferred into a tube containing 10 mL of
MKTT broth and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h.

Plating out and identification
Xylose lysine desoxycholate (XLD, Oxoid Ltd., England)
agar and brilliant green agar (BGA, Oxoid Ltd., England)
plates were used for plating out and identification. A
loop full of inoculums from each RV and MKTT broth
cultures were plated onto XLD and BGA plates and in-
cubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, the plates
were examined for the presence of typical and suspect
Salmonella colonies. Typical colonies of Salmonella
grown on XLD agar have a black center and a lightly
transparent zone of reddish color due to the color
change of
the media [31] while hydrogen sulfide-
negative variants grown on XLD agar are pink with a
darker pink center. Lactose-positive Salmonella grown on
XLD agar are yellow with or without blackening. Typical
colonies of Salmonella on BGA are pink, 1 mm to 2 mm
in diameter, and change the color of medium to red.

Biochemical tests
For the confirmation of the typical Salmonella colonies
using biochemical tests, typical and suspected colonies
of Salmonella were selected from the selective plating
media, streaked onto the surface of nutrient agar (Oxoid
Ltd., England) plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h
according to ISO 6579 [31]. All suspected non-lactose
fermenting Salmonella colonies were picked from the
nutrient agar and inoculated into triple sugar iron (TSI)
agar, Simmon’s citrate agar, urea broth, tryptone water,
methylene red and Voges-Proskauer (MR-VP) broth
(Oxoid Ltd., England) and incubated for 24 at 37 °C. A
colony was considered Salmonella if an alkaline slant

fide was produced, positive for lysine (purple), negative

utilization (indole test) (yellow-brown ring) and negative
for Voges-Proskauer (colorless) [32].

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
The antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed
using the disc diffusion method. The result was inter-
preted as per the recommendation of National Commit-
tee for Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
[33]. In short, isolated colonies from the nutrient agar
plates were transferred into tubes containing 5 mL of
tryptone soya broth (Oxoid Ltd., England). The broth
culture was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h until it achieved
0.5 McFarland turbidity standards. A sterile cotton swab
was used to swab the inoculum uniformly over the sur-
face of Muller Hinton agar plate. The plates were held at
room temperature for 30 min to allow drying and tested
for ampicillin (AMP) 10 μg, gentamicin (CN) 10 μg,
kanamycin (K) 30 μg, ciprofloxacin (CIP) 5 μg, chloram-
phenicol
sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim
(SXT) 25 μg, tetracycline (TE) 30 μg, nalidixic acid (NA)
30 μg, streptomycin (S) 10 μg, and cefoxitin (FOX)
30 μg. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The
diameter of the zones of inhibition was classified as re-
sistant,
intermediate, or susceptible according to the
CLSI [33]. All antibiotics were Oxoid Ltd., England

Data management and analysis
Data of
laboratory results were entered in Microsoft
Excel spread sheet and analyzed using SPSS version 20.
Descriptive analysis was conducted to determine the
prevalence of Salmonella in the centers and the farm.
Association of risk factors with Salmonella isolation fre-
quencies was analyzed using χ2 test (Fisher’s exact test).
Furthermore, univariate and multivariate logistic regres-
sion analyses were performed to reveal the strength of
association of the potential risk factors and Salmonella
prevalence. The significance level was set at α = 0.05.

Results
Substandard biosecurity and personnel hygiene practices
in the centers
Interviews with center supervisors revealed that
the
management practices at the breeding and multiplication
centers were generally poor as summarized in Table 1.
The hygiene of
the poultry houses was also sub-
standard, as litter changes and pest control were not car-
ried out regularly. Working and protective materials
were commonly used between houses. Personnel en-
gaged in poor safety practices (i.e. hand washing, etc.).
Antibiotics were prescribed irrationally based on symp-
toms without diagnosing the causative agent for the sick
animals on the farms. In this regard, suspicion of a
single sick chicken in the centers often led to blanket
prescription of antimicrobials to all the chickens in the
centers. Over prescription of drugs was practiced to

Prevalence of Salmonella distribution
Salmonella was isolated from 45 of the 270 samples
(16.67%); 36 of 244 cloacal swabs (14.8%), 6 of 17 pooled
bedding sample (35.3%), and 3 of 9 hand swabs sampled
from farm attendants (33.3%). Both bedding and hand
swab samples had significantly (p = 0.028) higher
Salmonella isolation rate than cloacal samples. The
prevalence of Salmonella was significantly higher at
Bonga than at Hawassa (p = 0.000). The Bonga poultry
multiplication center had a significantly higher preva-
lence of Salmonella than the other two multiplication
centers (p = 0.001). Cage versus litter nor Leghorn ver-
sus Bovans did not significantly (p > 0.05) affect the
prevalence of Salmonella detected (Table 2). Young age
groups (chicks and cocks) had a significantly (p = 0.003)
higher prevalence followed by layers than the other age
groups.

Univariate analysis of risk factors indicated that sam-
ples from Bonga had a significantly (p = 0.001) higher
odds of being Salmonella positive than those from

Hawassa. Study areas, multiplication centers and sample
types had a significant association with Salmonella preva-
lence (Tables 2 and 3). Finally, multivariate logistic regres-
sion analysis was conducted for association between risk
factors and Salmonella isolation. After the effect of other
risk factors were adjusted for, only sample type had a sig-
nificant effect on Salmonella recovery. In this regard, bed-
ding had higher Salmonella contamination than chicken
(cloacal) samples [OR for bedding vs. poultry cloacal = 7.5;
95% CI for OR = 2.0–25; p = 0.002].

Antimicrobial susceptibility test
Forty-five Salmonella isolates were subjected to the anti-
microbial susceptibility test. All of the 45 isolates (100%)
were resistance to kanamycin and sulfamethoxazole-
trimethoprim. Almost all (44 isolates, 97.8%) also had
resistance
acid,
streptomycin, and tetracycline. Resistance to chloram-
phenicol and ciprofloxacin was 91.1% and 31.1%, re-
spectively. All
(100%) were susceptible to
gentamicin with three isolates manifested intermediate
breakpoints (Table 4).

Phenotypic patterns to antimicrobial resistance
All 45 isolates (100%) were multi-drug resistant to ≥3
antimicrobials. Forty-two isolates (93.3%) exhibited re-
sistance to ≥8 antimicrobials simultaneously (Table 5).
The 45 Salmonella isolates manifested nine different
phenotypic patterns to 10 antimicrobials. The most widely
distributed pattern was resistance to AMP*C*CIP-I*FOX*-
K*NA*S*SXT*TE with 24 (53.3%) of the 45 isolates exhibit-
ing this pattern. Nine of the 45 isolates (20.0%) displayed
the AMP*C*CIP*FOX*K*NA*S*SXT*TE pattern.

Three Salmonella isolates from hand swabs displayed dis-
turbing AMR to 8 antimicrobials (two isolates) and 9 antimi-
crobials (one isolate). All isolates from personnel and poultry
bedding were resistant to at least eight antimicrobials, but
susceptible to gentamicin and ciprofloxacin (Table 6). The
six isolates from bedding samples revealed resistant to eight
or nine antimicrobials (four and two isolates respectively).
The distribution of resistance patterns of the isolates across
different locations, management, breed and sample type in
southern Ethiopia is indicated in Table 6.

Discussion
Salmonella is one of the important pathogens in the
poultry industry [34]. Additionally, it is one of the major
cause of bacterial foodborne gastroenteritis of humans
with poultry being indicated as the major source for hu-
man infection [17, 35]. Salmonella can enter the food
supply at many points in the food production chain
(processing, distribution, preparation, or handling steps).
Thus, food safety should involve intervention at all of
the steps along the production chain in order to safe-
guard the health of consumers [36]. Some intervention
have been successful against Salmonella in the process-
ing plants [37]. The effect of Salmonella intervention on
the farms to reduce Salmonella prevalence along the
food chain requires further evaluation. Understanding of
the ecology of Salmonella helps to reduce horizontal
and vertical transmission. Furthermore, tracing the ori-
gin of Salmonella outbreaks and the antimicrobial resist-
ant patterns of isolates are fundamental to containing
the risk. However, little is known about the Salmonella
problem in chicken breeding, multiplication and distri-
bution centers in Ethiopia. The present study was con-
ducted to determine the prevalence of Salmonella and
their AMR in poultry production and multiplication
centers in southern Ethiopia.

The overall prevalence of Salmonella was 16.7% in this
study. Our finding is similar to the 17.9% prevalence on
layer farms in Italy [38], but lower than the 42.7% re-
ported from Jimma in western Ethiopia [21] and 36.1%

in broilers in Japan [39]. The variation in prevalence re-
ported could be due to the variation in the sample type,
location, breed, and/or age of the chickens [40]. Given
that observation of a single sick chicken can led to a
blanket prescription of antimicrobials to the entire flock
at the centers (as per the respondents), the intensive
antimicrobial use currently could also contribute to the
lowered prevalence in our findings. The present finding
was higher than the 8% prevalence reported from small-
scale chicken farms from Hawassa [41]. It has been
reported that farm type and chicken flock density might
have a significant impact on the prevalence of Salmon-
ella, particularly about 7 times higher on large-scale ver-
sus small-scale farms [42] and nearly 8 times higher on
conventional compared to organic farms [43].

In the current study, breed, age, sample type and loca-
for
tion have been evaluated as

regard, both White
Leghorn and Bovans Brown chicken breeds were equally
susceptible. However, some researchers have reported
that breed differences on the level of susceptibility to

triggering factors

In this

Salmonella exists among different chicken lines [24, 44].
In this regard, resistant lines to S. Typhimurium have
also shown resistance to S. Gallinarum, S. Pullorum, and
S. Enteritidis, and lines susceptible to S. Typhimurium
are more susceptible to the other Salmonella serotypes
[44]. This suggests that a general mechanism of resist-
ance that may apply to all serotypes of Salmonella in
chicken [44]. Three levels of susceptibly have been no-
ticed among chicken lines to Salmonella. These include
(i) highly susceptible chicken lines which reveal greater
localization of Salmonella in the reproductive tract (verti-
cal transmission) in addition to harboring Salmonella in
other body parts, (ii) moderately resistant which reveal
greater localization of Salmonella in the intestine along
with long term persistence in the liver and spleen, and (iii)
highly Salmonella resistant chicken lines [45]. As prophy-
lactic measures, vaccination and use of antibiotics are
insufficient to eradicate salmonellosis in poultry stocks,
some researchers have tried to control Salmonella infec-
tion, its carrier-state and drug resistant Salmonella strains
through rearing Salmonella resistant chicken lines [46].

Young age groups (chicks and cock) harbored higher
Salmonella prevalence in this study. This suggests a
higher susceptibility of younger chicks to Salmonella. In
this regard, it has been reported that the ability to sur-
vive infection increases with age, and mortality is great-
est in newly hatched chicks [47]. Unfortunately, once
Salmonella infects chicks at a young age, they remain in
a carrier state for a prolonged period of time [48]. The
high susceptibility and inability of the young chicks to
clear the infection (persistent carrier) could be due to
the fact that infection at a younger age is less effective in
producing protective immunity than infection in older
chickens [48]. Chicks infected at 4-days of age remain (i)
a carrier until they start lay eggs, (ii) produced Salmon-
ella infected eggs; and hence, (iii) the progeny is infected
via vertical transmission [45]. Following young chicks,
laying hens were the next most susceptible age group in
this study. The higher prevalence of Salmonella infection
in laying hens might be due to physiological stress of
egg production and molting, which significantly de-
presses the immune response and increases the suscepti-
bility to Salmonella infection [49]. The interesting part
of Salmonella is its ability to infect chicks at early age,
persist for long time in the infected chickens and allows
for vertical transmission to the progeny through con-
taminated eggs. This may complicate the epidemiology
and control of Salmonella in chicken multiplication cen-
ters of Ethiopia, as Salmonella was highly abundant
among young chicks followed by laying hens in this
study.

The abundance of Salmonella distribution was higher
in Bonga (27%) than Hawassa (10.6%) area in the present
study. Significantly more isolates were detected in Bonga
than Hawassa (OR = 3.1). Bonga has a humid climate
with diverse fauna (cockroaches, mice, birds and other
animals), which is important for persistence and spread
of Salmonella. These factors might have contributed to
the higher abundance of Salmonella at Bonga than at
Hawassa. Furthermore, the higher tendency of rearing of
mixed age groups in the Bonga area than in the Hawassa
area may also contribute to the current difference in
prevalence. In this regard, multi-age management of
layers as opposed to all-in/all-out practice has been asso-
ciated with a higher risk of Salmonella contamination
[38]. The management practice of single age rearing is
reported to protect of chickens from several infectious
diseases as opposed to mixed age chicken rearing [50].
Differences in biosecurity practices and management
standards on the poultry farms may explain this vari-
ation. It has been reported that poor biosecurity exposes
the birds to numerous potential sources of Salmonella
contamination [16]. Furthermore, the risk of Salmonella
contamination in flocks reared on litter was higher with
multiage management than on farms with an all-in/all

out practice or farms with a single flock [50]. However,
cage and litter based chicken rearing system didn’t have
a significant difference in this study.

Salmonella were recovered from a significant number
of poultry bedding samples (environment, 35.3%) in our
study. Our finding is lower than the 58.8% reported from
poultry bedding in Nigeria [51]. The difference may be
due to the environmental persistence of Salmonella
which affects its epidemiology in poultry by creating op-
portunities for the horizontal transmission of Salmonella
among chickens within the flocks [52] and Salmonella
can be introduced into the flocks from many different
sources [25, 26]. There are a lot of possible sources of
Salmonella contamination in poultry flocks from cock-
roaches and lesser mealworms which can carry Salmon-
ella internally and externally and spread Salmonella
throughout
the flock [53, 54]. Mice have also been
important vectors for Salmonella in laying hens [55].
Practices such as unhygienic farming activities, lack of
adequate biosecurity measures and movement of birds
and equipment from one house or farm to another often
worsens the situation. Mice, wild birds, ants and other
insects have been shown to be important agents for
Salmonella transmission among chickens,
flocks and
farms [56].

Currently, 33.3% of the 9 attendants carried Salmon-
ella on their hands contributing three isolates (6.7%) of
the 45 Salmonella isolates collected in this
study.
Personnel hand contamination is a real concern due to
limited supply of personnel hygiene supplies, poor hand
washing practices and the high levels of Salmonella in
the beddings of this study. These factors could lead to (i)
self-infection of personnel from the Salmonella on their
hands and possible contamination of their families, (ii)
spread of
infection to individuals in the centers and
guests by routine hand shaking as part of the cultural
greetings in Ethiopia and (iii) spreading infection be-
tween poultry houses in the centers. Prompt attention is
necessary to address the contamination of personnel
hands in order to safeguard the safety of the personnel
and the animals on the farms. Salmonella is responsible
for 1.4 million cases of human illness, 20,000 hospitali-
zations and over 500 deaths annually in US [17] of
which 46.4% of the isolates are from animal sources
mainly poultry [35]. Of concern in this study is that all
of the isolates from hands were multidrug resistant.

Fifty percent of the isolates in this study were resistant
to at least one antimicrobial. This is in agreement with
the 57–66% of the isolates in Europe [57] and 79.8% of
isolates from processed poultry in US [18]. Another
study of a national monitoring system reported AMR of
30.5% among the total US isolates [58].

In this study, the most effective drug was gentamicin
with 0/45 (0%) isolates resistant, followed by ciprofloxacin

Abdi et al. BMC Infectious Diseases  (2017) 17:352 

Page 10 of 12

with 14/45 (31.1%) were resistant. No reports of resistance
to gentamycin or ciprofloxacin have been made in sheep
and goats isolates in central Ethiopia [59], dairy farm iso-
lates in Addis Ababa [60] or human isolates in Nigeria
[61]. Gentamycin is still effective against Salmonella irre-
spective of the time or location of the study. We have not
found information on whether gentamycin is or is not
widely used, prescribed or distributed in Ethiopia or other
African countries. Lack of use of these two antimicrobials
could explain the lack of resistance in the recovered iso-
lates. In two previous studies conducted in Ethiopia, 41.2
and 46% of isolates were resistant to tetracycline; 22.5 and
75% were resistant to streptomycin; and 30% were resist-
ant to chloramphenicol. In our study, 100% of isolates
were resistant
to kanamycin and suflamethoxazole-
trimethoprim; 97.8% of isolates were resistant to ampicil-
lin, cefoxitin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin and tetracycline;
and 91.1% of the isolates were resistant to chlorampheni-
col. These findings represent a potential increase in the
antimicrobial resistance in Ethiopian flocks. This increase
could be due to the unregulated increase in the use of pre-
scription antimicrobials [14], often purchased and used by
unskilled practitioners in the veterinary and public health
sectors [62]. There is a lack of compliance and monitoring
for antimicrobials at all levels in Ethiopia. Additionally,
the use of antimicrobial drugs at sub-therapeutic or
prophylactic dosages in food animals may promote on
farm selection of antimicrobial
in
Salmonella as well as other potential human and animal
pathogens.

resistance genes

Overall, 42 isolates (93.4%) exhibited a MDR pheno-
type to more than 8 antimicrobials simultaneously.
These MDR isolates had different resistant pattern. Spe-
cifically, 11 isolates were resistant to 9 antimicrobials
and 31 were resistant to 8 antimicrobials while two were
resistant to only 7 antimicrobials and one isolate was
resistant
to only three antimicrobials. This level of
MDR was higher than the 32.65% [63], 44.8% [64], and
83.3% [60] reported previously in Ethiopia. Interest-
ingly, the number of MDR Salmonella isolates has in-
creased in many countries. In the US, 53.4% isolates
from processed poultry are MDR [18] and 15–18% of
the European isolates [57] are MDR. The widespread
resistance of Salmonella isolates in this study may sug-
gest that the gross indiscriminate use of antimicrobial
agents in the poultry production setting is responsible
for this increase, which has also been suggested by
other researchers [65, 66]. In fact, multiplication cen-
ters indiscriminately prescribe drugs for the entire flock
if ill health is noticed in a single chicken on the ground
in order to prevent the spread of infection to healthy
chickens at the centers. This excessive misuse of anti-
microbial drugs subjects all bacteria present to selective
pressures and could lead to the development of

resistance to the drugs currently in use and proposed
for future use [67]. The incorporation of antibiotics in
the animal diets at sub-therapeutic levels to serve as a
prophylaxes and/or a growth promotants has invariably
contributed to the development of antibiotic resistant
strains of Salmonella [68]. Overall, abundance the
abundance MDR Salmonella isolates
from poultry
multiplication centers render poultry meat and eggs a
very important potential source of resistant bacteria
and hence a serious potential public health concern.
However, the limitation of lack of serotype and geno-
type data in this study precludes the analysis of the re-
latedness of
the specimens collected from different
centers including from humans.

Conclusions
Of 270 samples tested, Salmonella was isolated from 45
(16.7%) of the samples. Salmonella was recovered from
chicken cloaca, the environment (bedding) and human
hands in the multiplication centers. Its distribution was
associated with location of the individual center/farm,
age of the chickens and the sample type indicating these
factors are important potential factors for intervention.
Substandard management practices and poor biosecur-
ity exposes the birds to numerous potential sources of
Salmonella. Overall, 93.4% of the 45 isolates exhibited
resistance against ≥8 antimicrobials while two isolates
were resistant to 7 antimicrobials and one was resistant
to three antimicrobials. This implies that all isolates are
MDR (100%). The high percentage of MDR isolates re-
covered indicate the potential importance of chickens
as a source of MDR Salmonella infections and a serious
public health concern, because the multiplication cen-
ters rely on the over use of drugs while practicing poor
biosecurity and sub-standard management. We con-
clude that the poultry breeding, multiplication and dis-
tribution centers in Ethiopia, as they currently stand,
are a source for the dissemination of pathogens and
drug resistant pathogens, at least Salmonella. Therefore,
we recommend personnel training on personal hygiene,
biosafety and farm biosecurity for all farm attendants and
visitors; education on zoonotic pathogens; restrictions on
the uncontrolled use of antimicrobials; and establishment
of a standard pathogen and AMR monitoring system in
poultry production. Overall, we hypothesize that control of
Salmonella infections in poultry will be one of the import-
ant steps to control Salmonella infections in public health.
