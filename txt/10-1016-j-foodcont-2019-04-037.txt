The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between hygienic indicators and Salmonella
contamination in poultry meat from retail markets in China. From July 2016 to December 2016, a total of 2331
samples were collected from different outlets in 20 provinces of China. All the samples were examined for
aerobic plate counts, Escherichia coli and Salmonella. The Salmonella serotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility
test were also performed. E. coli was found in 45.80% (1091/2331) of poultry samples. E. coli were significantly
positive correlated to aerobic plate count. Salmonella was tested positive in 369 (15.83%) samples. In poultry
samples, aerobic plate counts and E. coli were significantly higher for samples contaminated with Salmonella.
Among 369 Salmonella isolates, a total of 73 serotypes were identified. Nine major serotypes, i.e., Salmonella
Enteritidis (25.20%), Corvallis (8.40%), Typhimurium (8.13%), Kentucky (7.86%), Indiana (4.61%), Dabou
(4.61%), Agona (4.34%), Rissen (3.79%) and Thompson (2.98%) accounted for 69.92% of all Salmonella isolates.
300 (81.30%) isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic, 119 (32.25%) isolates were multi-drug resistant.
Aerobic plate count and E coli may be considered as good indicators for Salmonella in poultry samples. The
results indicated that Salmonella contamination in retail poultry meat in China was much higher than that in the
United States and EU countries, but the contamination level was lower than that in Korea and Japan. Good
agricultural practices, good manufacturing practices, and hazard analysis critical control point systems for
Salmonella control in poultry production at farm, processing, and retail level should be implemented. The results
are useful for risk assessment of Salmonella contamination of poultry meat in China and provide valuable in-
formation for future national control policy in China.

1. Introduction

Poultry and poultry products are recognized as major vehicles for
Salmonella transmission to human. Contamination may occur during
primary production, at slaughter or in later stages of the supply chain
(Jamali, Radmehr, & Ismail, 2014; Mezal, Stefanova, & Khan, 2013).
Several hygiene indicators are used to evaluate microbiological status
of raw meat products. High level of hygiene indicators are associated
with potential degradation of nutrients in meats, thus becoming in-
edible. Aerobic plate count is frequently used as an indicator to monitor
the hygiene status during meat production process; Escherichia coli (E.
Coli) is often an indicator to assess enteric contamination (Capita,
Prieto, & Alonso-Calleja, 2004). In the United States, E. coli is the

mandatory indicator for bovine, swine and poultry carcasses and is used
to verify effectiveness of the hazard analysis critical control point
(HACCP) plans (Hogue, White, & Heminover, 1998). In the European
Union, The Regulation EC 2073/2005 on microbiological criteria for
foodstuffs has established the surveillance of aerobic plate count and
Enterobacteriaceae as hygiene indicator criteria for cattle, sheep, goat,
horse, and pig carcasses (EFSA, 2007, pp. 12–29). In Korea and Japan,
the government also lay down a law to control E. coli and pathogen
levels in meat products (Kim et al., 2018). In China, government set the
standard of food-borne pathogens in ready-to-eat poultry meat (NHFPC.
China, 2013), but there is no microbial limit for raw poultry meat in
Chinese national food safety standard (NHFPC/CFDA. China, 2016).

significant
interest among public health authorities and industry
(Scallan et al., 2011). The human salmonellosis cases in Europe and the
United States have triggered strong regulations with the goal to reduce
Salmonella in poultry flocks (Oort, 2011). The EU directive 2160/2003
was developed to reduce Salmonella levels in poultry, which prescribes
targets for maximum Salmonella levels in broilers, layers, breeders and
turkeys. Each member state in Europe has to set up specific National
Control Plans (NCP) to address how to comply with the EU directives
(Oort, 2011). The implementation of these regulations has had a strong
effect on flock contamination with Salmonella and consequently in meat
or eggs. As a result, significant reduction was observed in human sal-
monellosis cases and Salmonella in poultry (EFSA/ECDC, 2015). While
regulations on reducing Salmonella and improving food safety are being
developing worldwide, there are no Salmonella control measures in
poultry/egg production in China, except in several large-scale slaugh-
tering enterprise.
Although more than 2000 serovars of Salmonella have been identi-
fied, most human salmonella infections are caused by a limited number
of serovars. S. Enteritidis and Typhimurium are the most common causes
of human salmonellosis worldwide (Bangtrakulnonth et al., 2004;
Galanis et al., 2006; Xia et al., 2009; Toyofuku, 2008). In the past 20
years, the emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella,
particularly the multidrug resistant (MDR) strains, is one of major
public health concerns. Most infections with MDR Salmonella are caused
by consumption of contaminated foods of animal origin (White et al.,
2001).
Salmonella serovars have been detected worldwide from various
foods, such as eggs, raw meats, vegetables, and dairy products. In
particular, eggs, chicken, and other meats and meat products are widely
known to be important sources of human salmonellosis (Chittick, Sulka,
Tauxe, & Fry, 2006; Toyofuku, 2008). Several studies have been con-
ducted on the prevalence of Salmonella contamination in poultry meat
in China, but the investigation area is relatively limited (Lu et al., 2011;
Wang et al., 2017). As a part of Chinese national surveillance program,
the objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence and anti-
microbial resistance of Salmonella isolates originating from raw poultry
meat in China, and to explore the relationship between the E. coli,
aerobic plate counts and the prevalence of Salmonella in poultry meat.
This is the first report of the prevalence of Salmonella serovars in
poultry meat throughout China.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Sampling

A total of 2331 samples were randomly collected from major su-
permarkets, free-trade markets, food stores, restaurant and online stores
from July to November in 2016 in 20 of 31 provinces across China. The
investigated regions were Beijing, Neimenggu, and Shanxi in northern
China, Heilongjiang and Liaoning in northeastern China, Anhui, Fujian,
Jiangsu, and Zhejiang in eastern China, Henan, Hubei and Hunan in
central China, Guangdong and Guangxi in southern China, Guizhou,
Yunnan and Chongqin in southwestern China, Shaanxi, Gansu and
Ningxia in northwestern China. The samples
included chicken
(n = 1754) and duck (n = 577), with different storage states (fresh,
chilled and frozen). All samples were transported on ice to the la-
boratories for analysis immediately after sampling.
2.2. Enumeration of aerobic plate count and E. coli

Aerobic plate counts were performed according to the method de-
scribed by National Food Safety Standards of China (GB 4789.2–2016).
Each meat sample (25 g) was homogenized into 225 mL sterile water to
make a 10−1 dilution. Three suitable serial dilutions was made de-
pending on the contamination status of samples. 1 mL was taken from
each diluent, transferred into agar medium, and incubated at 36 °C for

Food Control 104 (2019) 99–104

48 h. Then the number of colonies was recorded.
The procedures for E. coli were performed according to the method
described by National Food Safety Standards of China (GB
4789.38–2012). Each meat sample (25 g) was homogenized into
225 mL sterile water to make a 10−1 dilution. Three suitable serial
dilutions was made depending on the contamination status of samples.
1 mL was taken from each diluent, then transferred into Violet Red Bile
Agar- Methyl umbrella ketone -D- glucoside acid (VRBA-MUG), and
incubated at 36 °C for 18–24 h. Colonies showed a light bluish fluor-
escence under ultra-violet light at wavelength of 360 nm–366 nm were
counted as E. coli.

2.3. Salmonella isolation and serotyping

Salmonella analysis was performed according to the method de-
scribed by National Food Safety Standards of China (GB 4789.4–2016).
Each meat sample (25 g) was homogenized into 225 mL of buffered
peptone water and incubated overnight at 36 °C. After incubation, 1 mL
of the pre-enriched suspension was incubated in 10 mL of Tetrathionate
Brilliant Green broth (TTB) at 42 °C and 10 mL of Selenite Cystine broth
(SC) at 37 °C for 18–24 h. A loopful with 10 μL of broth was streaked
onto Bismuth Sulfite Agar (BS) with subsequent
incubation for
40–48 h at 36 °C, and streaked onto xylose lysine deoxycholate agar
(XLD), with subsequent incubation for 18–24 h at 36 °C, respectively.
After incubation, BS and XLD agars were screened for colonies resem-
bling Salmonella spp. by morphology, and typical suspicious colonies
were stabbed into triple sugar iron slant (TSI) and Lysine decarboxylase
test agar for further confirmation. The inoculated triple sugar iron agar
and Lysine decarboxylase test agar was incubated for 18–24 h at 36 °C
and isolates with typical Salmonella phenotypes were confirmed.
For all confirmed Salmonella isolates, serotypes were determined by
slide agglutination using commercial O and H antisera (Statens Serum
Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark), and results were interpreted according
to the Kauffmann-White scheme.

2.4. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Salmonella

Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the
broth microdilution method using the Biofosun® Gram-negative panel
(Fosun Diagnostics, Shanghai, China) and interpreted according to the
Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline (CLSI, 2015).
Salmonella isolates were further analyzed for antimicrobial resistance to
the 14 most commonly used antibiotics in foodborne disease outbreaks
monitoring system in China (Li & Han, 2017). The 14 antimicrobial
agents included ampicillin (AMP), ampicillin/sulbactam (SAM), cefa-
lothin (CF), cefepime (CPM), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftazidime (CAZ),
imipenem (IMP), meropenem (MEM), gentamicin (GEN), ciprofloxacin
(CIP), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT), Chloramphenicol (CHL),
nalidixic acid (NA) and tetracycline (TET). E. coli ATCC 25922 was used
as a quality control organism for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

2.5. Statistical analysis

Values were log-transformed for analysis as appropriate. When no
colony was detected, a value of 50% of the limit of detection was in-
putted for analysis (Hutchison et al., 2005).
The Mann-Whitney test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used to com-
pare the differences of aerobic plate count and E. coli. Chi-square tests
were used to assess the proportion of samples above the detection limit.
Correlation between different indicator (e.g. aerobic plate count and E.
coli) was analyzed by Spearman rank correlation test.
All analysis was performed using R Statistical Software. Results with
a P-value of ≤0.05were considered significant.

3. Results
3.1. Aerobic plate count, E. coli and Salmonella in poultry samples

The microbiological results were not significantly different between
chicken and ducks, so results were pooled from these two kinds of
poultry.
Aerobic plate count was significantly different between fresh,
chilled and frozen poultry (P < 0.001), with a median of 5.53, 5.43
and 4.85 log CFU/g, respectively. E. coli was found in 45.80% (1091/
2331) of poultry samples. E. coli contamination was also significantly
different between fresh, chilled and frozen poultry (P < 0.001), with a
median of 1.60, 1.81 and 0.70 log CFU/g, respectively. These results are
shown in Table 1 and Table 2.
E. coli was significantly correlated with aerobic plate count
(P < 0.05). The spearman correlation coefficient (rs) was the highest
for chilled samples (rs = 0.229 for fresh poultry, 0.324 for chilled
poultry and 0.081 for frozen poultry).
Salmonella was found positive in 369 (15.83%) analyzed samples,
with contamination rates as 16.35%, 16.80% and 14.64% in fresh,
chilled and frozen samples, respectively. The difference between the
three storage conditions was statistically significant
(P < 0.05).
Salmonella prevalence pooled from the three conditions was highest in
Heilongjiang (27.00%), Henan (25.31%), Beijing (24.03%), Hunan
(21.71%), and Guangdong (21.43%) (Fig. 1).

3.2. Relationship between aerobic plate count, E. coli and the prevalence of
Salmonella

Samples that were Salmonella positive had higher levels of aerobic
plate count compared to samples that were Salmonella negative. The
difference was also statistically significantly in each storage state
(Fresh, chilled or frozen, P < 0.001). Similarly, samples with positive
Salmonella had larger number of E. coli (P < 0.001). However, this
difference was only significant for fresh poultry samples, but not sig-
nificant (P > 0.05) for chilled and frozen poultry samples. The med-
ians of E. coli and aerobic plate count in relation to the Salmonella re-
sults were shown in Table 3.

3.3. Salmonella Serotypes

Among 369 Salmonella isolates, a total of 73 Salmonella serotypes
were identified. Enteritidis (n = 93, 25.20%) was most common, fol-
lowed by Corvallis (31, 8.40%), Typhimurium (30, 8.13%), Kentucky
(29, 7.86%), Indiana (17, 4.61%), Dabou (17, 4.61%), Agona (16,
4.34%), Rissen (14, 3.79%) and Thompson (11, 2.98%). The nine major
serotypes accounted for 69.92% of all Salmonella isolates. Most of those
serotypes were isolated from fresh chicken and frozen chicken samples.

3.4. Antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella

A total of 300 (81.30%) Salmonella isolates were found to be re-
sistant to at least one antibiotic; 119 (32.25%) isolates were resistant to
at least 3 types of antibiotics. NA (65.04%), TET (48.78%), AMP
(41.73%) and SAM (38.48%) was observed to have the highest re-
sistance. Resistance to CF, CHL, SXT, CIP, CTX, GEN, CPM and CAZ was
found in 21.95%, 20.87%, 20.05%, 12.47%, 11.92%, 11.38%, 7.86%
and 4.07% of isolates, respectively. All isolates were susceptible to IMP
and MEM. Overall, the antibiotic resistance of these isolates varied in
the detected serotypes. From the nine major serotypes, 70.59% S.
Indiana and 72.41% S. Kentucky were identified to be resistant to
multiple antibiotics, which were much higher than other major ser-
otypes of Salmonella (Fig. 2). The antimicrobial susceptibility of Sal-
monella isolates was detailed in Table 4.

4. Discussion
4.1. Hygienic indicators in poultry samples

E. coli could be used as a hygiene indicator for poultry products to
monitor slaughtering procedures and the assess efficiency of scalding,
singeing or flaming, evisceration, and chilling, which dramatically
limits pathogen contamination of meat (Ghafir, China, Dierick, De, &

Daube, 2008). Aerobic plate count, which is an indicator of overall
hygienic conditions, were highly correlated with E. coli. Our study
found that poultry samples contaminated with Salmonella had sig-
nificantly higher levels of aerobic plate count and E. coli, indicating
aerobic plate count and E. coli may be considered as good indicators for
enteric zoonotic agents such as Salmonella in poultry products.
To maintain sanitary conditions, Many countries have regulations
requiring that the aerobic plate count level be < 105–107 CFU/g or
cm2, and the E. coli level be < 102–104 CFU/g or cm2 (Kim et al.,
2018). However, there is no microbial limit for raw poultry meat in
Chinese national food safety standard (NHFPC/CFDA. China, 2016). In
this study, the 75th percentile of the poultry was 6.08 log CFU/g and
3.00 log CFU/g for aerobic plate count and E. coli, respectively.

European countries and the United States in 2013, respectively (EFSA/
ECDC, 2015; USDA/FSIS, 2014). The level was much lower than the
data from current study. The prevalence of Salmonella in retail chicken
in Korea is variable from 22.4% to 42.3% reported (Chung, Kim, &
Chang, 2003; Hyeon et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2012). In Japan, Salmonella
isolates were detected in 20.0% of the chicken meat samples obtained
between 2006 and 2008 (Iwabuchi, Yamamoto, Endo, Ochiai, & Hirai,
2011). The results in Korea and Japan are higher than that in this study.
The Risk assessment for salmonellosis in chicken in Korea indicated that
the efforts to prevent the contamination level of Salmonella in chicken
contamination should be prior to efforts to decrease the contamination
at the slaughtering stage (Jeong, Chon, Kim, Song, & Seo, 2018). In
Europe, it is widely accepted that the observed reduction in salmo-
nellosis cases (32% between 2008 and 2012) was mainly due to tight
Salmonella control measures implemented in poultry/egg production
(Antunes, Mourão, Campos, & Peixe, 2016). In the United States, re-
duction of contamination rates of Salmonella in broiler meat and sal-
monellosis has also been reported (USDA/FSIS, 2014).
Storage condition also plays a key role in Salmonella contamination.

4.2. Salmonella contamination in poultry samples

In this study, 15.83% of poultry meat was contaminated with
Salmonella. EFSA/ECDC and USDA/FSIS reported that Salmonella con-
tamination was observed in 7.5% and 3.9% in broiler meat from

4.3. Salmonella Serotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility

Among 369 Salmonella isolates, 93 (25.20%) isolates were identified
as S. Enteritidis, which was the most common serovar in this study. This
serovar was also found to be a predominant serovar in poultry products
in other survey studies (Galanis et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2015; Yang
et al., 2010). In most of the Salmonellosis outbreaks resulted from
poultry products consumption, Enteritidis and Typhimurium serovars
have been isolated (Vose, Koupeev, & Mintiens, 2011). S. Enteritidis is
the most frequent one in the EU (39.5% in 2013) and USA (14.5% in
2012) followed by S. Typhimurium (28.8% in EU, 2013; 11.6% in USA)
(CDC, 2014; EFSA/ECDC, 2015). In Korea, Salmonella was the third
most common cause of food poisoning only after enteropathogenic Es-
cherichia coli and norovirus (Korea Portal of Food Safety Information,
2019) between 2002 and 2018, and Salmonella Enteritidis is the main
cause of foodborne gastroenteritis (Yoon et al., 2014). In Japan, More

In our study, aerobic plate count, E. coli and prevalence of Salmonella on
frozen poultry were significantly (P < 0.05) lower than the samples
that were kept chilled and ambient temperature. The frozen samples
were mostly processed in large-scale slaughtering and processing en-
terprises, which may have internal control of quality management

were associated with S. Enteritidis from 1999 to 2004, S. Typhimurium
ranked between second to fourth in different years (Toyofuku, 2008).
Other major serovars in the present study included Corvallis (8.13%),
Typhimurium (8.13%), Kentucky (7.86%), Indiana (4.61%), Dabou
(4.61%), Agona (4.34%), Rissen (3.79%) and Thompson (2.98%). The
findings were in agreement with those described in previous studies
which showed that Enteritidis, Typhimurium, and Indiana are the most
common serovars in poultry meat in China (Gong et al., 2016; Lu et al.,
2011; Wang et al., 2017).
Poultry and poultry products were considered as predominant
sources to the incidence of Salmonella spp, and were also major sources
of antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella (Yang et al., 2010). Overuse and
misuse of antimicrobials in different areas including animal feeds,
farmer's veterinary drugs, and veterinary therapy have increased the
prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria (Hur, Kim, Park, Lee, & Lee,
2011). Antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella has become a significant
public health concern worldwide (Figueiredo, Henriques, Sereno,
Mendonca, & Da, 2015; Hsu et al., 2006). Lin-Hui Su et al. reported
Salmonella antimicrobial resistance was significantly increased from
20% to 30% in the early 1990s to as high as 70% in some countries in
2000s (Su, Chiu, Chu, & Ou, 2004). Our study found that only 69
(18.70%) of the Salmonella isolates were susceptible to the anti-
microbial agents tested, whereas 300 (81.30%) of the isolates were
resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent, 119 (32.25%) were mul-
tidrug resistant. Consistently, a high percentage of antimicrobial re-
sistant Salmonella from retail poultry meat was also reported by others
(Arvanitidou, Tsakris, Sofianou, & Katsouyannopoulos, 1998; Chen
et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2010). The antibiotic resistance of the isolates
varied between detected serotypes. Of the major serovars identified in
the present study, Kentucky (72.41%) and Indiana (70.59%) showed
the highest rate of multidrug resistance, whereas Enteritidis was more
susceptible to antimicrobial agents, which was in agreement with pre-
vious studies among Salmonella recovered from retail meats (Antunes,
Reu, Sousa, Peixe, & Pestana, 2003; Su et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2017;
Zhao et al., 2007), but was different from some reports (Antunes et al.,
2003; Chen et al., 2004).

5. Conclusions

Aerobic plate count and E. coli may be good indicators to identify
Salmonella contamination in poultry samples. Salmonella contamination
in retail poultry meat in China was much higher than that in EU

countries and the United States, but the contamination level was lower
than that in Korea and Japan. The results are useful for determining the
current situation of Salmonella contamination of poultry meat in China
and provide valuable fundamental
information for future national
control policy in China. Successful control of Salmonella in poultry
could have a large impact on the overall incidence rate of poultry-as-
sociated illnesses, such as Salmonellosis. Good agricultural practices,
Good manufacturing practices, and hazard analysis critical control
point systems for Salmonella control in poultry production at farm,
processing, and retail level should be implemented.
