A total of 189 Salmonella isolates were recovered from 627 samples which were collected from cecal contents of
broilers, chicken carcasses, chicken meat after cutting step and frozen broiler chicken products along the
slaughtering process at a slaughterhouse in Sichuan province of China. The Salmonella isolates were subjected to
antimicrobial susceptibility testing to 10 categories of antimicrobial agents using the Kirby–Bauer disk diﬀusion
method. Those antibiotics-resistant isolates were further investigated for the occurrence of resistance genes, the
presence of class 1 integron as well as the associated gene cassettes, and the mutations within the gyrA and parC
genes. Consequently, the prevalence of Salmonella was 30.14% (47.96% for cecal content, 18.78% for chicken
carcasses, 31.33% for cutting meat and 14.00% for frozen meat, respectively). The predominant serotypes were
S. Typhimurium (15.34%) and S. Enteritidis (69.84%). High resistance rates to the following drugs were ob-
served: nalidixic acid (99.5%), ampicillin (87.8%), tetracycline (51.9%), ciproﬂoxacin (48.7%), trimethoprim/
sulfamethoxazole (48.1%), and spectinomycin (34.4%). Antimicrobial resistance proﬁling showed that 60.8% of
isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR), and MDR strains increased from 44.7% to 78.6% along the slaughtering
line. 94.6% (n = 157) of beta-lactam-resistant isolates harbored at least one resistance gene of blaTEM or blaCTX-
M. The relatively low prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance genes (aac(3)-II, aac(3)-IV, and ant(2″)-I) was
found in 49 (66.2%) of antibiotic-resistant isolates. The tetracycline resistance genes (tet(A), tet(B), tet(C), and tet
(G) and sulfonamide resistance genes (sul1, sul2, and sul3) were identiﬁed in 84 (85.7%) and 89 (97.8%) an-
tibiotic-resistant isolates respectively. ﬂoR was identiﬁed in 44 (97.8%) ﬂorfenicol-resistant isolates. Class 1
integron was detected in 37.4% (n = 43) of the MDR isolates. Two diﬀerent gene cassettes, blaOXA-30-aadA1 (19
isolates) and blaOXA-30-aadA1/drfA1-orfC (2 isolates), were identiﬁed in class 1 integron-positive isolates. 97.9%
(184/188) of quinolone-resistant isolates had at least one mutation within gyrA or parC. Overall, antimicrobial
resistance showed an increasing trend along the slaughtering process. The results showed that broiler chicken
products in the slaughterhouse were contaminated with MDR Salmonella, which might originate from food
producing animals to some extent, and cross-contamination during slaughter, and facilitate the dissemination of
the resistance genes to consumers along the production chain, which suggests importance of controlling
Salmonella during slaughter for public health, underlying strict hygiene method and HACCP management to
reduce cross-contamination.

1. Introduction

Salmonella is one of the most common foodborne pathogens, causing
outbreaks of
foodborne disease worldwide (Newell et al., 2010).
Foodborne Salmonella infection typically causes a range of clinical

syndromes in humans including typhoid fever, diarrhoeal disease, and
may have a dramatically more severe systemic disease in the im-
munocompromised people (Gordon, 2008). Animal
food products
especially eggs and poultry meats, have been the most common vehicles
of
the Salmonella infections (Greig and Ravel, 2009). With the

increasing consumption of poultry meat globally, bacterial pathogen
Salmonella, as an important factor for aﬀecting the safety of poultry and
raw meat, will continue to receive growing attention (Henchion et al.,
2014; Sofos, 2008).

Recently, there has been an increasing trend of antimicrobial re-
sistance on a worldwide scale, especially for multidrug-resistant (MDR)
Salmonella strains from food animals (Hur et al., 2012). In China, the
usage of antimicrobial agents is greater than in most other countries; in
a 2007 survey, nearly half of the 210, 000 tons of antibiotics produced
in China, were used in livestock as therapeutic drugs and feed additives
(Hvistendahl, 2012). Abuse of antimicrobial agents in food animal
production is regarded as one of the important reasons for emergence of
antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella; this resistance can be trans-
mitted to the human population through the animal foodstuﬀs, which
poses a serious threat to public health. Multidrug-resistant phenotypes
in Salmonella of animal origin have been increasingly observed in China
(Lai et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2013).

Various factors from farm to fork along the food chain heavily in-
ﬂuence the microbiological safety of food (Newell et al., 2010). Suc-
cessful prevention of foodborne salmonellosis originating from animal
production comprise three lines of defence against Salmonella: a) con-
trolling Salmonella in the food-producing animal at farms (pre-harvest
control); b) improving hygiene during the slaughter and further pro-
cessing of the meat (harvest control); c) the ﬁnal food preparation by
underlying good hygiene practices (post-harvest control) (Forshell and
Wierup, 2006). Therefore, slaughter is the most appropriate stage of
food chain for the evaluation on the carriage of zoonotic agents by farm
animals, the level of Salmonella infection in animal carcasses and sub-
sequently meat products in the ﬁnishing poultry population, and the
proportions of self- and cross-contamination during slaughter and
processing (Bonardi et al., 2013).

Most studies about the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of
Salmonella in either animals (Ahmed and Shimamoto, 2012; Lai et al.,
2014; Mainali et al., 2014; Pan et al., 2010) at chicken farms or in retail
poultry meats of marketplace (Chen et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2012; Yan
et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2011), or
in partial processing stages in the slaughtering line (Akbarmehr, 2012;
Bai et al., 2015; Olsen et al., 2003; Rivera-Pérez et al., 2014; Ziech
et al., 2016) have been separately performed. Additionally, several
surveys have been carried out at the molecular level to monitor the
distribution of resistance genes in Salmonella from broiler chickens and
chicken meat (Asai et al., 2006; Gong et al., 2014; Li et al., 2013). To
date, some research on prevalence of Salmonella from animals to
chicken meat products along the slaughtering process (Choi et al., 2014;
Cui et al., 2016; Li et al., 2013; Van der Fels-Klerx et al., 2008), and the
potential role of the food production chain in the dissemination of
antimicrobial resistance and resistance genes of Salmonella (Cui et al.,
2016; Li et al., 2013) have been presented. However, the present studies
have reported β-lactamase genes and class 1 integron of Salmonella
isolates from the broiler chicken supply chain in China, while other
kinds of resistance genes in Salmonella along the slaughtering process
were still almost not reported. In addition, the poultry sector in China
has experienced vigorous growth over the past two decades. Chicken
production is the predominant subsector, accounting for 70% of poultry
meat production. The poultry sector is no longer dominated by hun-
dreds of millions of smallholders. Instead, the number of large produ-
cers in poultry and broiler chickens production increased substantially
(Bingsheng and Yijun, 2007). Therefore, taking into account the im-
portant role of large-scale slaughterhouse and poultry farm, and the
high consumption of chicken meat in China, more comprehensive in-
vestigations at the molecular level to monitor the distribution and
dissemination of antimicrobial
resistance during slaughter were
needed.

Therefore, in this study, four processing points along the slaugh-
tering process were selected to monitor the prevalence, antimicrobial
resistance, and resistance gene dissemination of Salmonella. In detail,

Salmonella isolates were collected at the four processing points in a
broiler slaughter and processing chain during a three-year period of
2012–2014, in Sichuan province of China. We investigated the pre-
valence, serotypes, antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella isolates to ten
categories of common antimicrobial agents, the presence of several
kinds of antimicrobial resistance genes associated with β-lactams,
aminoglycosides, tetracycline, ﬂorfenicol, and sulfonamide, and class 1
integron, gyrA and parC mutations of quinolone-resistant isolates. On
the basis of these results, we analyzed the correlation between the
antibiotics-resistant phenotypes, serotypes, and resistance genes of
Salmonella isolated from diﬀerent stages of the poultry meat production
chain, and identiﬁed possible routes of Salmonella transmission.

2. Material and methods

2.1. Sample collection

From March 2012 to October 2014, a total of 627 samples were
collected from four processing points (cecal content of broiler chicken,
n = 196; chicken carcasses, n = 181; chicken meat after cutting step,
n = 150; frozen chicken meat products, n = 100) during slaughter and
processing at a local broiler chicken slaughtering plant in Sichuan
province of China where about 30,000,000 broiler chickens are pro-
cessed each year. All these samples were stored on ice during trans-
portation to our laboratory, and analyzed within 3 h.

The main slaughter process in this slaughterhouse and four sam-
pling points were given in Fig. S1 in Supplementary materials. Fresh
broiler chicken cecal contents (point 1), representing samples of broiler
at the farm level, were obtained after evisceration, and collected in
sterile plastic stomacher bags in accordance with previously described
method (Allen et al., 2007). Chicken carcasses (point 2) were sampled
after evisceration and before chilling by using a whole-carcass swab
method (McEvoy et al., 2005). Each swab was placed inside a sterile
stomacher bag and pre-moistened immediately before use with 25 mL
of buﬀered peptone water (BPW). The swabs after sampling were re-
turned to its original bag, and transported on ice to lab. For sampling
points 3 (chicken meat after cutting step) and 4 (frozen chicken meat
products), 25 g of each sample was incised, and collected in a sterile
plastic stomacher bag according to the methods described in the ISO
17604:2003 standard (International Organization for Standardization,
Geneva, Switzerland). For sampling point 4, chicken meat products in
this slaughterhouse were packaged after quick-freezing, and then the
packaged quicken-frozen chicken meat products were directly collected
without being stored by using our sampling method.

2.2. Salmonella isolation and serotyping

All of the samples were subjected to Salmonella isolation in ac-
cordance with national food safety standard of China-Food micro-
biological inspection: Salmonella (GB 4789. 4-2010), with some mod-
iﬁcations for samples obtained at point 2. For samples obtained at point
2, they were stomached, incubated at 37 °C for 18 h (bacteria pre-en-
richment), and then subjected to centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 4 °C,
10 min). Finally, the BPW supernatant was removed and discarded, and
about 4 mL of the pre-enrichment culture containing bacterial pre-
cipitate was obtained. Then, aliquots of 1.0 mL were transferred into
10 mL of tetrathionate broth (TTB) and selenite cysteine (SC) broth,
respectively. The subsequent procedure was carried out in accordance
with GB 4789.4-2010.

Suspected Salmonella colonies from each sample were further
identiﬁed on the basis of biochemical characterization and speciﬁc
genes of Salmonella using duplex PCR assays (Cohen et al., 1993; Rahn
et al., 1992). A single conﬁrmed Salmonella isolate from each positive
sample was serotyped by slide agglutination test for O and H antigens
using commercially available antiserum (Tianrun Bio-Pharmaceutical,
Ningbo, China) following manufacturer's instructions.

2.3. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the Salmonella isolates to 10
categories of antimicrobials was carried out in accordance with the
standard Kirby–Bauer disk diﬀusion method recommended by the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, 2010) (Cockerill,
2011). All the antimicrobial disks were obtained from Oxoid (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc, Basingstoke, England). Escherichia coli ATCC 25922
was used as the control organism. The concentrations of the anti-
microbials and abbreviation of these antimicrobial agents are: ampi-
cillin (AMP, 10 μg), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC, 20/10 μg), cef-
triaxone (CRO, 30 μg), gentamycin (GEN, 10 μg), spectinomycin (SPE,
100 μg), tetracycline (TET, 30 μg), ﬂorfenicol (FLO, 75 μg), trimetho-
prim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT, 1.25/23.75 μg), nalidixic acid (NAL,
30 μg), and ciproﬂoxacin (CIP, 5 μg). The isolates were classiﬁed as
susceptible, intermediate, or resistant according to the CLSI (2010)
guidelines. Salmonella isolates resistant to three or more antimicrobials
were deﬁned as MDR isolates (Li et al., 2013; Pokharel et al., 2006).

2.4. PCR ampliﬁcation of antimicrobial resistance genes

Template DNA of Salmonella isolates for PCR was prepared by the
heat lysis method (Pitout et al., 1998), except that bacteria were di-
rectly inoculated into 3.0 mL of nutrient broth in Eppendorf tubes for
overnight culture. Finally, the template for ampliﬁcation was obtained,
and stored at −20 °C for use.

Salmonella isolates, which showed resistance to each category of
antimicrobial agent, were examined for the presence of resistance
genes. The presence of genes associated with beta-lactams (blaTEM,
blaSHV, and blaCTX-M), aminoglycosides (aac(3)-II, aac(3)-IV, and ant
(2″)-I), tetracycline (tet(A), tet(B), tet(C), and tet(G)), ﬂorfenicol (ﬂoR),
sul2, and sul3) was detected by PCR
and sulfonamide (sul1,

ampliﬁcation. The primer sequences and predicted sizes for PCR am-
pliﬁcation of diﬀerent resistance genes from Salmonella are listed in
Table 1. PCR ampliﬁcation was performed using a DNA thermal cycler
(Bio-Rad, CA, USA) as (1) 95 °C for 10 min; (2) 35 cycles of 94 °C for
45 s, 55–70 °C for 50 s, 72 °C for 50 s; (3) 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR
products were analyzed through 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis
and sequenced by Takara biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Dalian, China). Re-
sulting DNA sequence data were compared with data in the GenBank
database using the BLAST tool available at the National Center for
Biotechnology Information website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

2.5. Detection and characterization of class 1 integron

Multidrug-resistant isolates (n = 117) were examined for the pre-
sence of the class 1 integron using speciﬁc primers for intI 1 gene (en-
coding the speciﬁc integrase) by PCR. The variable region of class 1
integron in all intI 1-postive isolates was also characterized by PCR and
sequencing. The size of inserted resistance gene cassettes of the in-
tegrase-positive isolates was detected by PCR using primers for the
conserved segment regions (CS-PCR) (Table 1). The PCR system (25 μL)
contained 2 μL of template DNA, 0.5 μL of each primer (10 μmol/L),
12.5 μL of 2× PCR Mix, 5.5 μL of deionized water. PCR ampliﬁcation
was performed using a DNA thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) as (1)
95 °C for 5 min; (2) 35 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 70 °C for 50 s (intI 1) (intI
1 variable region, 55 °C for 50 s), 72 °C for 50 s; (3) 72 °C for 10 min.
The PCR products were analyzed through 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel
electrophoresis and sent for sequencing by Takara biotechnology Co.,
Ltd. (Dalian, China). The DNA sequence data were compared with data
in the GenBank database using the BLAST tool available at the National
Center for Biotechnology Information website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov).

2.6. Detection of the gyrA and parC mutations by MAMA-PCR of
quinolone-resistant isolates of Salmonella

The most common mechanisms of resistance to quinolones are
mutations in DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II, in gyrA and gyrB genes) and
topoisomerase IV (in parC and parE). These mutations are primarily
located in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of the
gyrA gene and its homologous region of the parC gene (Qiang et al.,
2002). Four amino acid substitutions, two in gyrA and two in parC
subunits of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, are commonly re-
sponsible for ﬂuoroquinolone resistance.

Mismatch ampliﬁcation mutation (MAMA) PCR assay was used to
detect mutations within both DNA gyrase (gyrA) and topoisomerase IV
(parC) gene using primers listed in Table 2. PCR was carried out ac-
cording to the reference (Qiang et al., 2002). The PCR products were
analyzed through 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis and se-
quenced by Takara biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Dalian, China). The nu-
cleotide sequences were analyzed using the BLAST tool available from
the National Center for Biotechnology Information website (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

2.7. Statistical data analysis

Conﬁdence intervals of proportions were calculated with EPi tools
(http://epitools.ausvet.com.au) using the binomial exact method.
Statistical signiﬁcance of diﬀerences between proportions was eval-
uated by Chi-square (χ2) test.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Prevalence and serotyping of Salmonella isolates

A total of 189 Salmonella isolates (2012, n = 84; 2013, n = 72;
2014, n = 33) were recovered from 627 samples collected from four
processing points along the slaughtering process. All the isolates were
identiﬁed by biochemical characterization and further conﬁrmed by
detecting one genus-speciﬁc gene and one virulence gene (invA) using
duplex PCR ampliﬁcation. The gel image of PCR products of partial
strains was shown in Fig. S2 in the Supplementary materials. The
overall
30.14% (95% C.I.
26.57%–33.90%). The isolation rate of Salmonella spp. was 47.96%
(95% C.I. 40.79%–55.19%) for broiler chicken cecal samples (point 1).
18.78% (95% C.I. 13.37%–25.25%) of samples from carcasses surface
after evisceration (point 2) were positive. The occurrence of Salmonella
at sampling points 3 and 4 were 31.33% (95% C.I. 24.02%–39.41%)
and 14.00% (95% C.I. 7.87%–22.37%) respectively (Table 3).

represented the contamination level of food-producing animals. The
result was also signiﬁcantly higher than previously reported 19.84% of
positive samples
in Shandong province of China,
2009–2012 (Lai et al., 2014). Broilers are widely considered to be an
important reservoir for Salmonella transmission, due to the ability of
Salmonella to proliferate in the gastrointestinal tract of the chickens and
subsequently contaminate processed broiler carcasses in the slaughter
and processing chain (Todd, 1980). Therefore, high prevalence in food-
producing animals in this commercial processing plant increases the
risk of carcass contamination and the human salmonellosis.

Compared with the occurrence at point 1 (47.96%), the con-
tamination level of chicken carcasses decreased signiﬁcantly at point 2
(18.78%) (P < 0.01), which may be attributed to hygiene manage-
ment in the slaughterhouse and rinse treatment on the chicken car-
casses after evisceration. However, the broiler chicken meat at point 3
presented much higher prevalence rate (31.33%) of Salmonella spp.
than 18.78% at point 2 (P < 0.01). It could be explained by cross-
contamination occurring at the several stages between points 2 and 3
during slaughter. Between the points 2 and 3, there are several main
stages including chilling of chicken carcasses, carcasses hanging, and
segmentation. In this processing plant, immersion chilling of chicken
carcasses is performed in pre-chillers with two tanks in series con-
taining sodium hypochlorite. By chilling, the carcasses would be re-
duced to a temperature of 7–10 °C that is generally regarded as the
maximum temperature for preventing the proliferation of mesophilic,
enteric pathogens (Sofos, 2005). However, several studies have been
conducted to evaluate the eﬀect of chilling on numbers and prevalence
of Salmonella. Immersion chilling has a minimal eﬀect on the pre-
valence of Salmonella on poultry carcasses. Other researchers also have
suggested that the washing eﬀect during immersion chilling physically
removes bacterial cells and thus reduces bacterial recovery, but this
eﬀect is likely oﬀset by carcass cross-contamination (Thomson et al.,
1979). In addition, other processing stages like carcasses hanging and
segmentation may also lead to the cross-contamination via external
animal surfaces, workers' clothes, hands or equipment, other carcasses,
plant equipment, and plant environment, etc. Therefore, all these fac-
tors might lead to the increasing prevalence of Salmonella from samples
at sampling point 3. A signiﬁcant decrease in the prevalence of Sal-
monella was detected at sampling point 4 (14.00%), which could be
explained by that the quick-freezing procedure makes Salmonella in-
activation, thus reducing the risk of human infection.

Apart from 28 untypable strains, the remaining 85.18% of the
Salmonella strains were identiﬁed into 2 serovar groups, including S.
Enteritidis (n = 132, 69.84%) and S. Typhimurium (n = 29, 15.34%)
(Table 3). The serotyping results indicated that S. Enteritidis and S.

from which 79 isolates at point 1 (40.31%)

Typhimurium were the dominant serovars in this slaughter and pro-
cessing chain. S. Enteritidis isolates were detected in all sampling
points,
(95% C.I.
33.38%–47.53%), 25 at point 2 (13.81%) (95% C.I. 9.14%–19.71%), 21
at point 3 (14.00%) (95% C.I. 8.88%–20.60%) and 7 at point 4 (7.00%)
(95% C.I. 2.86%–13.89%). In addition, 29 S. Typhimurium isolates
were from the latter three processing stages, and S. Typhimurium was
not detected from fresh broiler cecal samples (point 1), which indicated
that there might be cross-contamination between chicken carcasses and
processing environment or workers during slaughter. The serotypes of
S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium are two common types isolated from
broiler carcasses in slaughter and humans infected by food borne dis-
eases (de Oliveira et al., 2005; Rabsch et al., 2001), which could cause a
range of clinical syndromes, including diarrhoeal disease. A survey
conducted by Wang et al. (2013) in China isolated and identiﬁed 23
isolates from the slaughterhouse, and these isolates belonged to six
diﬀerent serotypes, including S. Indiana, S. Infantis, S. Derby, S. Hei-
delberg, S. Agona and S. Typhimurium. Li et al. (2013) identiﬁed
fourteen serotypes among 129 Salmonella isolates from pigs, ducks and
chickens in one food production chain in Sichuan province, China, and
the top three serotypes were S. Derby (n = 76), S. Typhimurium
(n = 16), and S. Potsdam (n = 9). By contrast, Salmonella isolates from
the present slaughterhouse showed less variety in serotype. Further-
more, it could be found that although samples were collected from the
same region, there also existed considerable diﬀerence in serotypes of
Salmonella isolates in diﬀerent slaughterhouses.

3.2. Antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella isolates

Fig. 1a shows the antimicrobial resistance of 189 Salmonella isolates
to ten categories of antimicrobial agents, which showed that all Sal-
monella isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent. High

resistance rates were observed against nalidixic acid (99.5%), ampi-
cillin (87.8%), tetracycline (51.9%), ciproﬂoxacin (48.7%), trimetho-
prim/sulfamethoxazole (48.1%), and spectinomycin (34.4%). Lower
levels of resistance were found for ﬂorfenicol (25.4%), gentamycin
(10.3%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (8.5%). Most of the isolates were
susceptible to ceftriaxone.

When antimicrobial resistance was analyzed by sampling points
(Fig. 1b), higher resistance rates to CRO, TET, SXT, AMC, CIP, GEN, and
SPE were observed in isolates from points 3 and 4 in comparison with
points 1 and 2, with the exception of FLO, AMP and NAL, which showed
roughly consistent resistance rate in these four sampling points.
Overall, higher resistance rates were found in the latter stages of
slaughter.

Salmonella isolates with diﬀerent serotypes showed diﬀerence in the
resistance to 10 antimicrobial agents (Fig. 1c). Resistance of S. En-
teritidis to FLO, SXT, NAL, and GEN was slightly higher than, or almost
equal to those of S. Typhimurium, while S. Typhimurium showed
higher resistance to CRO, TET, AMP, AMC, CIP, and SPE than S. En-
teritidis.

The antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella isolates from samples in
diﬀerent years also showed the diﬀerence (Fig. 1d). It could be seen
that antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella isolates to CRO, TET, SXT
and SPE increased gradually from the year 2012 to 2014. Additionally,
the resistance of Salmonella strains in 2014 to FLO, AMC and CIP was
much higher than those in 2012. There was almost no diﬀerence in
resistance to AMP, NAL, and GEN in the three-year period. Overall,
there was an increasing trend in antimicrobial resistance with time.

Totally, 45 resistance patterns of these isolates to 10 categories of
antimicrobials were found (Table 4). 60.8% (n = 115) of isolates were
MDR strains. 19.6% (n = 37) of isolates were resistant to seven or more
antimicrobials and 3.2% (n = 6) of isolates were resistant to up to nine
antimicrobials. The dominant resistance pattern was NAL-AMP (28.6%,

54/189), followed by NAL-SXT (8.5%, 16/189), AMP-CIP-TET-SPE-
NAL (7.9%, 15/189) and AMP-CIP-SXT-TET-SH-NAL-FLO (6.3%, 12/
189). Along the slaughtering process, there was a descending trend for
the numbers of resistance patterns (point 1, n = 25; point 2, n = 16;
point 3, n = 17; point 4, n = 9).

The results showed that 66.7% (n = 88) of S. Enteritidis isolates
were resistant to one to three categories of antimicrobial agents, while
S. Typhimurium isolates were mainly resistant to four to six categories
of antimicrobials (89.7%, n = 26), which indicated that MDR pheno-
types in Salmonella are strongly associated with serotype (Cui et al.,
2016). Salmonella isolates from diﬀerent sampling points also showed
diﬀerent multidrug resistance (Table 5). Isolates from point 1 (55.4%)
and point 2 (50.0%) were mainly resistant to one to three classes of
antimicrobials, while isolates from point 3 (51.1%) and point 4 (50.0%)
were mainly resistant to four to six kinds of antimicrobials. Higher

resistance rates to up to 9 categories of antimicrobials were found in
isolates from point 4 (21.4%). Therefore, it could be concluded that the
multidrug resistance became more serious along the slaughtering pro-
cess. S. Typhimurium isolates were mainly resistant to four to six ca-
tegories of antimicrobials (89.7%, n = 26), including 6 isolates from
point 2, 16 isolates from point 3, 4 isolates from point 4; in addition,
two S. Typhimurium isolates from point 4 were resistant to up to nine
categories of antimicrobials. Additionally, as described above, 29 of S.
Typhimurium strains were isolated from the latter three processing
stages, and not detected in fresh broiler cecal samples (point 1).
Therefore, it could be concluded that there might be cross-contamina-
tion between chicken carcasses and processing environment or workers
in this processing plant, especially locating between the points 2 and 3,
which leads to the increase of percentage of MDR strains in the latter
processing stages, and facilitates the dissemination of the multi-drug
resistance to consumers.

In addition, we can see from the Table 5, there was a decreasing
trend in multi-drug resistance in S. Enteritidis from point 1 (34.2%) to
point 3 (23.8%), while 57.2% of S. Enteritidis isolates at point 4 were
MDR strains. Therefore, it might be concluded that the Salmonella iso-
lates due to cross-contamination between point 3 and point 4, instead of
raw broiler chicken, increase the risk of MDR strains in ﬁnishing
chicken meat products. For untyped serotypes, all strains isolated from
point 1 (n = 15), point 2 (n = 3), and point 3 (n = 10) were MDR
strains, which indicated that due to rinse treatment on chicken car-
casses, the prevalence of Salmonella and MDR strains decreased sig-
niﬁcantly; there might exist cross-contamination between points 2 and
3. However, there were no isolates from ﬁnishing frozen chicken meat
products (point 4), which terminates the transmission of MDR strains to
consumers.

In terms of sampling time, isolates recovered in 2012 were mainly
resistant to one to three categories of antimicrobials (60.7%), while
51.4% and 43.0% of isolates from 2013 were resistant to one to three

48

antimicrobials and four to six categories of antimicrobials respectively.
By contrast, more serious multi-drug resistance occurred in 2014, when
all the isolates were resistant to at least four to six categories of anti-
microbials, which indicated that multi-drug resistance also exhibited an
increasing trend over the three-year period. Antibiotics are commonly
used in concentrated animal feeding operations worldwide to treat
animal diseases and promote animal growth (Sarmah et al., 2006). In
the slaughterhouse we chose, these broiler chickens are from one
poultry farm where the workers at the farm also continuously used the
common antibiotics categories in alternation in the long term for
treating and preventing bacterial infections, thus improving growth and
production, which necessarily results in the increasing antibiotic re-
sistance. Veterinary drug residues including tetracyclines, beta-lactam
antibiotics and quinolones, etc. have been detected in poultry meat and
animal feedingstuﬀs (Al-Ghamdi et al., 2000; De Wasch et al., 1998;
Kabir et al., 2004; McEvoy, 2002; Okerman et al., 2001). Figuring out
the correlation between the antibiotics used in the animal feed and the
antibiotic resistance proﬁle presented in this slaughterhouse is quite
necessary, and requires further investigation in future.

Therefore, in this slaughterhouse, eﬃcient measures to facilitate the
reasonable use of antimicrobials in animal husbandry must be taken
(McEwen and Fedorka-Cray, 2002). Also, more importantly, strict hy-
giene method and HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points)
management during slaughter are vital for preventing food infection
caused by Salmonella (Harris et al., 1995).

3.3. Antimicrobial resistance genotypes of Salmonella isolates

Among 166 beta-lactam-resistant isolates, 94.6% (n = 157) har-
bored at least one resistance gene of blaTEM or blaCTX-M. The blaSHV gene
was not detected in any of the isolates. The PCR results were in ac-
cordance with those of antimicrobial susceptibility tests. The blaTEM
gene (93.4%, n = 155) was the most prevalent in beta-lactam-resistant
isolates, followed by blaCTX-M gene (12.7%, n = 21). Both blaTEM and
blaCTX-M genes were simultaneously detected in 11.4% (n = 19) of the
isolates.

Higher frequency of blaCTX-M gene was found in isolates from point 4
(16.7%) compared with isolates from other points. In terms of serovars,
the prevalence of blaTEM for S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium was
97.3% and 93.1%, respectively. The blaCTX-M gene was found in 46.9%
(n = 15) of isolates in 2014, compared with only 6.0% (n = 3) and
only 3.4% (n = 3) of isolates in 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Among 91 sulfonamide-resistant isolates, 97.8% (n = 89) harbored
at least one gene of sul1, sul2 or sul3. The sul2 gene had the highest
occurrence (97.8%, n = 89), followed by sul3 (50.5%, n = 46) and sul1
(50.5%, n = 46). The co-occurrence of sul1-sul2-sul3 was most pre-
valent (28.6%, n = 26), followed by sul2-sul3 (22.0%, n = 20) and
sul1-sul2 (22.0%, n = 20).

Among 98 tetracycline-resistant isolates, 85.7% (n = 84) harbored
at least one tet gene. The tet(C) gene (71.4%, n = 70) was the most
prevalent, followed by tet(B) (50%, n = 49) and tet(A) (23.5%, n = 23).
The most popular co-occurrence was tet(B)-tet(C) (20.4%, n = 20),
followed by tet(A)-tet(B)-tet(C) (17.3%, n = 17), tet(A)-tet(C) (5.1%,
n = 5) and tet(A)-tet(B) (1.0%, n = 1). None of the isolates was positive
for tet(G). Isolates from point 1 (85.7%, n = 36) and point 2 (85.7%,
n = 12) carried the tet(C) gene, while the tet(B) gene was the main
tetracycline-resistant gene among isolates from point 3 (58.1%, n = 18)
and point 4 (81.8%, n = 9).

Except for one S. Typhimurium strain, the ﬂoR gene was identiﬁed
in 97.8% (n = 44) of ﬂorfenicol-resistant Salmonella strains (n = 45).
The antimicrobial resistance genotypes were highly in accordance with
the phenotypes.

For 74 aminoglycosides-resistant isolates, 49 Salmonella strains
(66.2%) carried aac(3)-II or aac(3)-IV, and none of the isolates har-
bored ant(2″)-I gene. The occurrence of aac(3)-II and aac(3)-IV was
35.4% and 53.2%, respectively. Additionally, 21 strains carried both

aac(3)-II and aac(3)-IV genes. We found that 21 of 22 gentamicin-re-
sistant isolates gave a positive signal for aac(3)-II (72.7%) or aac(3)-IV
gene (81.8%). 53.8% (35/65) of spectinomycin-resistant isolates car-
ried aac(3)-II, aac(3)-IV, or ant(2″)-I gene, which indicated the rela-
tively low consistency between antimicrobial resistance phenotype and
genotypes. This might be explained by other resistance mechanisms or
antimicrobial resistance genes which mediate the resistance to specti-
nomycin.

3.4. Prevalence and characteristics of class 1 integron

Of the 115 MDR Salmonella strains which were screened for the
presence of class 1 integron, 43 isolates (37.4%, 43/115) harbored class
1 integron. Among them, 21 strains were positive for resistant gene
cassettes containing two distinct patterns, including blaOXA-30-aadA1
(19 isolates), blaOXA-30-aadA1/drfA1-orfC (2 isolates). In the present
study, 72.4% (n = 21) of S. Typhimurium and 31.7% (n = 19) of S.
Enteritidis harbored the intI 1 gene respectively. The highest prevalence
of class 1 integron was found in isolates from point 4 (72.7%, n = 8),
followed by isolates recovered from point 2 (38.9%, n = 7). The results
indicated that the carriage of class 1 integron was related to serotype,
source, and other factors (Hur et al., 2011; Wannaprasat et al., 2011). In
addition, 48.8% of intI 1-positive strains were found to carry gene
cassettes in our study, which is similar to the prevalence of 61.5%
(Molla et al., 2007) and 61.1% (Khemtong and Chuanchuen, 2008). In
2013, 57.8% of isolates harbored class 1 integron in contrast to 44.7%
in 2012 and 0 in 2014, respectively.

Twenty-one of S. Typhimurium isolates were positive for gene cas-
settes, while no gene cassette was detected in S. Enteritidis and un-
typable strains. Higher prevalence of resistant gene cassettes was found
in isolates from point 2 (n = 6), point 3 (n = 8) and point 4 (n = 7),
compared with isolates from point 1 (n = 0). The results indicated that
cross-contamination between chicken carcasses and processing en-
vironment or workers during slaughter might play an important role in
transmission of multi-drug resistance and resistance genes to con-
sumers. All intI 1-positive S. Typhimurium harbored gene cassettes in
our study, which is consistent with previous studies that 78% to 100%
of S. Typhimurium strains were positive for the intI 1 gene harboring
gene cassettes (Antunes et al., 2006). In the present study, the gene
cassettes blaOXA-30-aadA1and drfA1-orfC were detected in S. Typhi-
murium, which have been identiﬁed previously (Khan et al., 2009;
Weill et al., 2006). The presence of class 1 integrons on plasmids is
considered to be the main mechanism for the rapid spread of multidrug-
resistant phenotypes among gram-negative bacteria (Rowe-Magnus
et al., 2002). Other gene cassettes, such as dhfr7, aacA4, dfrA5, addA2-
blaPSE-1, and blaOXA-1 in S. Typhimurium, have also been reported in
previous studies (Eguale et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2004).

3.5. Mutations within gyrA and parC

One hundred and eighty-eight quinolone-resistant isolates were
analyzed by MAMA PCR. The results deﬁned ﬁfteen groups according to
mutations in gyrA and parC (Table 6). Except for four strains which had
no mutations in gyrA and parC, the remaining 184 quinolone-resistant
isolates had at least one mutation within gyrA or parC (alone or in
combination with other mutations in gyrA or parC), which indicated
that resistance phenotype was considerably associated with the occur-
rence of resistance gene.

Mutations were found in gyrA (Ser-83, n = 144; Asp87, n = 152)
and parC (Ser-80, n = 140; Glu-84, n = 145). A total of 64 isolates had
a single mutation in either Ser-83 or Asp-87 of gyrA, while 55 isolates
had one mutation either in Ser-80 or Glu-84 of parC. Moreover, 32
isolates had double mutations in gyrA, one mutation in parC (Glu-84 or
Ser-80), and 34 isolates had a single mutation in gyrA (Ser-83 or Asp-
87) and double mutations in parC. Additionally, 79 isolates had double

83 (100%, n = 14) and Asp-87 (100%, n = 14) of gyrA and Glu-84
(85.7%, n = 12) of parC was found from frozen meat samples. Lower
frequency of mutations in gyrA and parC was found among isolates from
2014 (Ser-83, 21.9%; Asp-87, 65.5%; Ser-80, 40.6%; Glu-84, 46.9%).
In conclusion, overall, antimicrobial resistance presented an in-
creasing trend along the slaughtering process. The result suggests that
raw broiler chicken might act as the reservoir for MDR Salmonella to
some extent, and cross-contamination between chicken carcasses and
processing environment or workers in this processing plant occurs,
which leads to the increase of percentage of MDR strains in the latter
processing stages and may facilitate the dissemination of the resistance
genes
to consumers along the slaughter and processing chain.
Therefore, eﬃcient measures to facilitate the reasonable use of anti-
microbials in animal husbandry must be taken. Also, more importantly,
strict hygiene method and HACCP management during slaughter are
vital for preventing food infection caused by Salmonella.
