The main goal of this study was to report the prevalence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) in raw milk and some dairy products sold in the local markets and villages at Dakahlia province,
Egypt. Raw milk, kariesh cheese, ice cream and hand swabs of dairy workers were sampled. It was
predicted the high prevalence and counts of detected coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus (CP S.
aureus) throughout all of the examined samples and swabs, which certainly reÔ¨Çect the neglected
hygienic practices either in the production of raw milk and dairy products or in the personal hygiene.
Molecular detection of mecA gene in the CP S. aureus isolates was adopted for the identiÔ¨Åcation of MRSA
strains, which could be only identiÔ¨Åed from 5 samples of raw milk and dairy products, and it was not
detected in any of the hand swabs. One out of the Ô¨Åve MRSA isolates showed resistance against both
vancomycin and oxacillin, while other strains showed resistance against oxacillin alone. This study is the
Ô¨Årst in term of MRSA detection in raw milk and its products in Egypt, and also elucidates a possible way
of transmission of community acquired MRSA.

1. Introduction

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a common member of the
natural microÔ¨Çora of human skin and nasal passage (Hanson et al.,
2011). In addition, as a potential pathogen, it may adversely affect
human and animal health by causing sever necrotic lesions, ab-
scesses (Lowy, 1998) and bacteremia (Reacher et al., 2000). More-
over, besides these pathogenic symptoms, toxigenic foodborne
strains of S. aureus, if they get multiplied in food to a certain level of
about 105e106 CFU/g, may secret potent, heat stable enterotoxins
responsible for food-borne intoxication (Tranter, 1990). S. aureus
intoxication ranked third of food poisoning cases all over the world
(Asao et al., 2003; Zhang, Iandolo, & Stewart, 1998) and had been
implicated with different categories of food including raw milk
(Jorgensen, Mork, Hogasen, & Rovik, 2005), dairy products
(Headrick et al., 1998), chicken, pork, beef and salad dishes (Bryan,
1998). Furthermore, S. aureus constitutes a primary cause of
mastitis in dairy cattle (Virgin, Van Slyke, Lombard, & Zadoks,
2009).

Among S. aureus, Methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA), has
recently emerged as a serious life-threaten infective agent which does

not respond to a lot of antimicrobial treatments. Previous reports have
shown an annual estimate of 94,000 MRSA infections in the United
States, with nearly 20% mortality rate (Klevens et al., 2007).

MRSA synthesizes a penicillin binding protein (PBP2a), encoded
by the mecA gene on a mobile genetic element (Staphylococcal
cassette chromosome mec SCCmec), which has a role of counter-
acting the inhibitory effect of Beta-lactam (b-lactam) antibiotics by
preventing them from effectively binding to cell wall proteins.
Moreover, MRSA may also resist vancomycin (Cui, Murakami,
Kuwahara-Arai, Hanaki, & Hiramatsu, 2000).

MRSA transmission has two main forms, hospital-acquired (HA)
and community-acquired (CA). Although, HA MRSA infection is
thoroughly investigated as the major form, CA MRSA presently
represents an imminent hazard and may have severe consequences
(Calfee, Durbin, & Germanson, 2003). Whilst, HA MRSA is strictly
linked to hospitals and health workers, CA MRSA is more wide-
spread and has no deÔ¨Ånite spreading vicinity (Wannet, Heck,
Pluister, Spalburg, & De Neeling, 2004) and its risk against indus-
trialized nations have been increased (Baggett et al., 2004; Doufour
et al., 2002; Frank, Marcinak, Mangat, & Schreckenberg, 1999;
Groom et al., 2001; O‚ÄôBrien, Pearman, Gracey, Piley, & Grubb, 1999;
Salmenlinna, Lyytik√§inen, & Vuopio-Varkila, 2002; Witte, Cuny,
Strommenger, Braulke, & Heuck, 2004).

Since S. aureus is highly prevalent in food and food environment,
MRSA may have the same pattern of linkage. Many reports (De Boer

et al., 2009; Kitai et al., 2005; Kwon et al., 2006; Lim et al., 2010;
Lozano et al., 2009; Pu, Han, & Ge, 2009; Van Loo et al., 2007; Weese,
Avery, & Reid-Smith, 2010; Weese, Reid-Smith, Rousseau, & Avery,
2010) have identiÔ¨Åed presence of MRSA in different retailed meat
products from different regions worldwide with varied prevalence.
Normanno et al. (2007) isolated MRSA strains from bovine milk and
some cheese varieties in Italy. Moreover, several food-borne ac-
quired MRSA outbreaks have been also reported (Jones, Kellum,
Porter, Bell, & Schaffner, 2002; Kluytmans et al., 1995).

Recent reports revealed that MRSA was also associated with
cases of bovine and caprine mastitis (Aras, Aydinb, & Kav, 2012;
Vanderhaeghen et al., 2010). MRSA strains have been found among
the S. aureus strains isolated from bovine mastitis milk but they are
not more prevalent (Hendriksen et al., 2008; Juh√†sz-Kaszanyitzky
et al., 2007; Kwon et al., 2005; Lee, 2003; 2006; Moon et al.,
2007). In addition, speciÔ¨Åc MRSA strain CC398 has been linked
with different food animals and people in contact, which arise a
new MRSA form, livestock-associated (LA-MRSA). LA-MRSA has
been isolated from both human and animal infections (Krziwanek,
Metz-Gercek, & Mittermayer, 2009) and from bovine mastitis case
(Monecke, S., Kuhnert, Hotzel, Slickers, & Ehricht, 2007). Afore-
mentioned reports may elucidate a possible way of transmitting
either CA-MRSA or LA-MRSA between food/animal handlers and
foods.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the Ô¨Årst study to reveal the
prevalence of MRSA strains in raw milk, some dairy products and
on hands of dairy workers (Milkers and food handlers) in Egypt.
Molecular MRSA identiÔ¨Åcation was accomplished by PCR detection
of mecA gene. Antibiotic susceptibility of isolated MRSA strains was
also tested.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Samples collection

A total of 120 samples (Table 1) were collected from the rural
areas (local markets and/or villages) located in Dakahlia province,
Egypt during the period of December, 2011 through February, 2012.
All samples were kept at 4 C in insulated ice box and transferred to
the dairy microbiology laboratory, Food control department,
Zagazig University and analyzed within 4 h of collection.

2.2. Sample preparation

In order to prepare decimal dilutions, raw milk and swab
soaking broth were used directly, whereas ice cream samples were
initially left at room temperature to be melted, while kariesh
cheese samples were homogenized (11 g of cheese sample with
99 ml 0.1% sterile peptone water (Oxoid) for 2 min) using Syclon-
04C Stomacher blender (Ningbo Sklon, China).

2.3. Staphylococcus aureus count and isolation

3M√î petriÔ¨Ålm√î Staph Express count plates (STX)

(3M
Corporate Headquarters; St. Paul, MN, USA) were used to
enumerate and isolate S. aureus (AOAC, 2003). BrieÔ¨Çy, 1 ml of
appropriate dilution was inoculated onto petriÔ¨Ålm and the inoc-
ulum was evenly distributed with a sterile plastic spreader. After
one minute at ambient temperature, the petriÔ¨Ålm was incubated
aerobically at 35 C for 24 h. According to the manufacturer‚Äôs
instructions, red-violet colonies were counted as S. aureus and
any plates with background colonies were subjected to, 3M√î
PetriÔ¨Ålm√î Staph Express Disk testing to differentiate S. aureus
according to the manufactures instructions. S. aureus colonies
appear surrounded with halo zone, which were then counted,
picked up and streak plated on Brain Heart infusion Agar (BHA,
BD) to establish pure cultures. Pure cultures were maintained
on Brain Heart Infusion broth (BHI) with glycerol (50% v/v)
at  70 C.

2.4. MRSA molecular identiÔ¨Åcation

S. aureus isolates were grown in BHI prior to DNA extraction
and puriÔ¨Åcation according to the DNA PuriÔ¨Åcation Kit (Qiagen)
procedure. S. aureus (MRSA) isolates were detected using the
following primers set: mecAFor (AAGCAATAGAATCATCAGAT) and
mecARev (AGTTCTGCAGTACCGGATTTGC) which were generated
by Primer-BLAST software using mecA gene sequence obtained
from Gene Bank√í (National Center for Biotechnology Information;
NCBI). AmpliÔ¨Åcation was done with the following proÔ¨Åle: Initial
denaturation at 94 C for 5 min, 40 cycles as follow: denaturation
at 94 C for 30 s, annealing at 55 C for 30 s and extension at 72 C
for 30 s, followed by Ô¨Ånal extension step at 72 C for 5 min. The
PCR product (451 bp) were electrophoreted on 0.5% agarose gel
and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. GeneRuler√î 100 bp
DNA ladder (Fermentas) was used as a molecular weight stan-
dard. PCR was performed on S. aureus ATCC 33591 (positive
control) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (locally isolate, negative
control).

2.5. Antibiotic resistance of MRSA

This experiment was designed to determine the minimal
inhibitory concentration (MIC) of oxacillin and vancomycin against
isolated MRSA strains. Graded-concentration antibiotic strips
(M.I.C.E. strips; Oxoid) were used. The strips were used according to
the manufacturer‚Äôs protocol. Simply, Muller-Hinton agar plates
(MH) was used and 0.5 McFarland inoculum of the S. aureus isolated
strains was swab-spread over the plate, then, M.I.C.E. strips were
aseptically placed on the dried surface within 15 min. Plates were
incubated at 37 C for 24 h.

3. Results and discussion

Counting and isolating S. aureus in food depends usually on
culturing viable cells on Baird Parker medium (Wehr & Frank,
2004); although, many constraints have been associated with this
medium, such as low selectivity and laborious preparation
(Schoeller & Ingham, 2001). Another important limitation of Baird
parker method, its inability to distinguish between thermonuclease
positive and negative S. aureus strains. Thus, STX plates were used
in this study to overcome all these shortages with Baird Parker
medium, since STX plates offer the selective differentiation be-
tween the DNase producer and non-producer S. aureus strains, in
addition to a more convenient applicability. While, regarding the
STX‚Äôs efÔ¨Åciency of isolating and counting coagulase and thermo-
nuclease S. aureus in raw milk and dairy products, a trial had been
done in this aspect and it was found that STX plates showed better
performance more than standard Baird Parker medium (Vi√ßosa,
Moraes, Yamazi, & Nero, 2010).

Results of S. aureus counts in tested products varied between
each other (Table 1). Certainly, many factors are responsible for
variations in prevalence and counting of food-borne pathogens, and
mostly, the neglected hygienic practices were the main factors in
case of S. aureus.

Out of 35 raw milk samples tested, nearly 94% (33 samples) were
contaminated by CP S. aureus with an average count of
5.5  105 CFU/ml.; for the kariesh cheese, 28 out of 30 (93%) sam-
ples tested were positive for CP S. aureus, with an average count of
6.2  105 CFU/g. On the other hand, CP S. aureus contamination for
ice cream was 17 out of 30, (57%) with an average count of
8.9  103 CFU/ml. Many surveys and reports have been done
regarding the prevalence of CP S. aureus in raw milk and dairy
products. Makita, Desissa, Teklu, Zewde, and Grace (2012)
remarked a high prevalence of S. aureus in raw bulk milk (43.5%
of examined samples), and this value increased signiÔ¨Åcantly at the
raw milk collection centers (72.0% of examined samples), which
was attributed to faulty handling. Andr√© et al. (2008) tested 24
samples of raw milk and 24 samples of minas frescal cheese (soft
cheese) for the presence of CP S. aureus, and they reported that
these samples were contaminated with CP S. aureus with a per-
centage of 66.7 and 70.8% respectively, which were slightly less
than our results. Although, a higher prevalence in raw milk was
reported by other researchers (Adesiyun, Webb, & Romain, 1998).
However, several reports revealed higher values than ours in case of
contaminated soft cheese (Ara√∫jo, Pagliares, Queiroz, & Freitas-
Almeida, 2002; Rosengren, Fabricius, Guss, Sylven, & Lindqvist,
2010). In a recent report of incidence of CP S. aureus in Turkish
cheese, 9.5% were contaminated with a mean log of 4.79 CFU/g
(Yesim Can and Haluk √áelik, 2012); although, higher incidences
were reported in other studies (Kuplulu, Sarƒ±mehmetoglu, & Celƒ±k,
2004; Normanno et al., 2005). In another survey, 100% of examined
soft raw milk cheese samples were contaminated by S. aureus
strains which were conÔ¨Årmed by PCR for the presence of entero-
toxin genes (sea, sed and sej), which were detected in many S.
aureus isolates (Cremonesi et al., 2007).

On the other hand, reports concerning ice cream contamination
with CP S. aureus have reported different percentages. Normanno
et al. (2005) found that out of 350 examined ice cream samples,
only 23 were contaminated by CP S. aureus. Warke, Kamat, Kamat,
and Thomas (2000) studied the surveillance of CP S. aureus in

packed and open retailed ice cream samples in India, and they
found that 100% of both brands were contaminated with CP S.
aureus with an average count of 2e3 log CFU/ml.

As a leading causative agent of bovine mastitis all over the world
(Buzzola et al., 2001), S. aureus usually Ô¨Ånds its way to bulk milk and
in turn contaminates other raw milk products (Andr√© et al., 2008).
Hand Swabs of dairy workers and food handlers revealed high
frequency of CP S. aureus colonizing their skins. 80% of hand swab
sample were positive for CP S. aureus; consequently, they may
constitute another sustainable source of CP S. aureus contamination
of dairy products. As an evidence of the seriousness of hand
contamination with CP S. aureus, toxic shock syndrome toxin 1
(TSST-1) gene was detected in S. aureus isolated from food handlers
(Rapini, Cerqueira, Carmo, Veras, & Souza, 2005) and from milk of
clinical and subclinical mastitis cases and from bulk tank milk
(Takeuchi, Ishiguro, Ikegami, Kaidoh, & Hayakawa, 1998). On the
controversy of our Ô¨Åndings, a lower incidence of S. aureus isolated
from dairy workers‚Äô hands has been mentioned (Sospedra, Ma√±es,
& Soriano, 2012).

From the aforementioned results, it can be clearly concluded
that the hygienic qualities of examined raw milk and dairy products
in this study were poor, in addition to poor personal hygiene, which
might play an important role in transferring S. aureus to dairy
products. Even though, in this study, the detection of preformed
enterotoxin in foods was not addressed, the numbers of recovered
S. aureus in either of raw milk and dairy products were quite
enough for toxin production (>105 CFU/ml or gm, Tranter, 1990).
Regarding to MRSA identiÔ¨Åcation, two identical CP S. aureus
colonies from each positive sample were selected for MRSA iden-
tiÔ¨Åcation, which was accomplished using mecA gene PCR detection.
Routine epidemiological surveys usually choose only one colony for
molecular identiÔ¨Åcation of MRSA (Gouloum√®s et al., 1996); how-
ever, the selection of two colonies was adopted here to confer more
creditability to the experiment. MRSA identiÔ¨Åcation based on mecA
gene detection is considered the best method for this purpose (Al-
Ruaily & Khlail, 2011; Aras et al., 2012; Normanno et al., 2007;
Vanderhaeghen et al., 2010) rather than phenotypic methods which
have usually many errors (Oliveira & Lencastre, 2002).

Based on PCR ampliÔ¨Åcation results, only 5 samples out of 95
tested yielded positive results for the mecA gene. Of the 5 isolates, 3
were from raw milk samples and 1 each from Kariesh cheese and
ice cream samples. While, none of the CP S. aureus isolates from
swabs of workers‚Äô hands was positive for the mecA gene.

Reports regarding prevalence of MRSA in food and in particu-
larly in milk and dairy products are generally scarce. Eleven MRSA
strains were identiÔ¨Åed among 118 S. aureus previously identiÔ¨Åed as
a causative agent of mastitis (Vanderhaeghen et al., 2010). Another
report revealed the detection of 2 MRSA strains among 42 S. aureus
strains isolated from caprine clinical mastitis cases (Aras et al.,
2012). Another study was able to isolate MRSA strains from raw
goat‚Äôs milk and associated workers in Czech Republic (Stastkova,
Karpiskova, & Karpiskova, 2009).

Considering MRSA identiÔ¨Åcation in other food stuffs, many re-
ports have identiÔ¨Åed its prevalence (retail chicken meats, Kwon
et al., 2006; cage-cultured Tilapia, Atyah, Zamri-Saad, & Siti-
Zahrah, 2010; retail meats and meat products, Hanson et al.,
2011; Pu et al., 2009; Weese, Avery, et al., 2010).

Bulk tank milk analyzes concerning MRSA detection were yet
very few; based mainly on either phenotypic or antibiotic suscep-
tibility differentiation. While, Erskine, Walker, Bolin, Bartlett, and
White (2002) and Makovec and Ruegg (2003) were able to detect
MRSA in Bulk tank milk (with a limited frequencies), Anderson,
Lyman, Bodeis-Jones, and White (2006) reported that out of 357
S. aureus strains isolated from raw milk at North Carolina, no strain
has any resistance against oxacillin.

52

R.M. Kamal et al. / Food Control 33 (2013) 49e53

To check out the antibiotic resistance of isolated MRSA strains,
two antibiotics (vancomycin and oxacillin) were chosen. Both an-
tibiotics have been widely used as the drug of choice for most MRSA
infections (Domaracki, Evans, & Venezia, 2000; Labrou et al., 2012).
Graded antibiotic strips were used to determine the MIC of each
antibiotic, which can be deÔ¨Åned as ‚Äúthe lowest antibiotic concen-
tration that will inhibit the visible growth of a microorganism after
overnight incubation‚Äù (Andrews, 2001). Generally, no statistical
differences for the minimum inhibitory concentration of oxacillin
were found between the tested 5 isolates and it was clearly
demonstrated that all detected MRSA strains in this study showed
resistance to oxacillin (MIC were >256 mg/ml). 4 MRSA isolates
were susceptible to vancomycin (MIC ranged from 0.06 to
0.12 mg/ml), however, only one MRSA isolate (isolated from raw
milk) showed resistance against both oxacillin and vancomycin
(MIC was >256 and >2 mg/ml, respectively).

Multidrug resistance of MRSA strains is not uncommon. MRSA
strains isolated from Turkish Tulum cheese were found to have
resistances to multiple antibiotics (Yesim Can and Haluk √áelik,
2012). Sawant, Sordillo, and Jayarao (2005) reported LA MRSA
resistance against b-lactam, aminoglycosides and macrolides.
Multidrug resistance by MRSA strains isolated from raw meat was
also reported by Hanson et al. (2011). Moreover, different antibiotic
resistances by S. aureus strains isolated from milk and dairy prod-
ucts were reported repeatedly (Aarestrup, Wegener, & Rosdahl,
1995; Gianneechini, Concha, & Franklin, 2002; Lange, Cardoso,
Senczek, & Schwarz, 1999; Tondo, Guimar√°es, Henriques, & Ayub,
2000).

4. Conclusion

CP S. aureus high prevalence among tested raw milk, milk
products and hand swabs highlighted the necessity of enforcement
of hygienic implementations and practices within dairy facilities.
Although, the experimental results showed a relatively low MRSA
detection in raw milk and dairy products samples, they possibly
represent major threats for transmission of this multidrug resistant
pathogen. As a future work, subsequent molecular and ecological
characterization of isolated MRSA strains should follow.
