Abstract

A total of 120 beef carcasses were analyzed during processing at a slaughterhouse in southern Brazil.
The carcasses were sampled by swab at three different steps of the slaughter line and then they were
tested for Salmonella and E. coli. The Salmonella isolates were also examined for antimicrobial sus-
ceptibility. Salmonella prevalence distribution was modeled and the probability of contamination
was simulated using @Risk program and 10,000 interactions. Results demonstrated that 4 beef car-
casses (3.3%) were positive for Salmonella only in the first point. The six isolates of Salmonella were
classified: S. Newport (n = 3), S. Saintpaul (n = 2) and S. Anatum (n = 1). No Salmonella strains ex-
hibited resistance to any of the antimicrobials tested. As expected, the most contaminated point with
E. coli was the first point (hide), presenting counts from 0.31 to 5.07 log cfu/100 cm2. Much smaller
E. coli counts were observed in the other points. Results indicated low levels of Salmonella and E.
coli on the beef carcasses analyzed and also low probability of contamination of the carcasses by Sal-
monella, suggesting adequate microbiological quality.

Key words: Salmonella, E. coli, beef carcasses, slaughter line, antimicrobial susceptibility.

Introduction

According to the United States Department of Agri-
culture (USDA), Brazil is the leading exporter of beef in the
world. In 2011, Brazil exported 1.8 million tons of beef and
the main markets were Russia, Iran, Hong Kong, Egypt and
Venezuela (USDA, 2011). Due to its importance in the in-
ternational market, the quality and food safety of Brazilian
beef must meet well-established international require-
ments. In order to evaluate microbiological quality of meat,
the quantification of E. coli and the presence of Salmonella
have frequently been used because these microorganisms
are considered good indicators of quality and food safety
worldwide. The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS)
in the United States of America has established the criteria
of a maximum 2.7% of Salmonella for cow and bull car-
casses tested per set and a maximum of 102 cfu/cm2 of E.
coli biotype I. The results of the quantitative analysis of car-
casses at a specified frequency for Escherichia coli biotype

I have been used to guide the maintenance of sanitary con-
ditions during slaughter (USDA, 1996).

Salmonella spp. has been identified as the most im-
portant contaminant of food and the leading bacterial agent
responsible for foodborne outbreaks in several countries
(Majowicz et al., 2010). In the last years, global surveil-
lance data indicated that the number of salmonellosis has
increased mainly associated with the consumption of raw
or undercooked eggs, poultry, meat or dairy products, dem-
onstrating the importance of controlling this pathogen in
food production (Braden, 2006; Kimura et al., 2004; Zhao
et al., 2001). In the European Union, meat products were
the second most common food group contributing to hu-
man salmonellosis in 2005 (Norrung and Buncic, 2008).

In Brazil, a remarkable increase in the incidence of
foodborne salmonellosis has been reported (Brasil, 2009).
According to the Surveillance Service of Brazil, among the
6,349 foodborne outbreaks registered in this country from

1999 to 2009, Salmonella was the most implicated bacterial
agent, and was responsible for almost 20.7% of the reported
outbreaks (Brasil, 2009). Corroborating these data, in Rio
Grande do Sul (RS), southern Brazil, Salmonella was iden-
tified as the main causative agent of foodborne diseases, re-
sponsible for 35.7% (116 outbreaks) of the total of 323
outbreaks investigated during 1997 to 1999, and the meat
products were the third most common food involved (Cos-
talunga and Tondo, 2002).

The increased use of antimicrobial agents in animal
production and human medicine as a mean of preventing
and treating diseases is a significant factor in the emergence
of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella. Therefore, resistant Sal-
monella which develops as a result of antibiotic use in ani-
mal production can be transferred to humans through the
food chain, and it is a problem to be considered. Contami-
nation of food with antibiotic-resistant bacteria can be a
major threat to public health, causing more difficulties in
the treatment of infectious diseases (Arslan and Eyi, 2010).
It is well know that the microbiological quality of
meat depends on the control measures implemented in the
slaughter lines, and in slaughterhouses working 24 h a day
the contamination events can occur very often. In order to
correct identify contamination procedures and establish
control measures, beef carcasses may be evaluated during
different steps of the slaughter.

The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence
and antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella spp. and the
contamination with E. coli on beef carcasses during differ-
ent steps of slaughter in a slaughterhouse in southern
Brazil.

Materail and Methods

Slaughterhouse and animals

Samples were taken at a slaughterhouse located in
Rio Grande do Sul, regulated by the Brazilian Federal In-
spection Service. The abattoir slaughtered approximately
200 animals daily and the slaughter was done mainly in the
morning. The collections were previously scheduled and
did not change the routine of the slaughterhouse. During the
period from September 2009 to June 2010, thirteen sam-
plings were carried out, analyzing a total of 120 carcasses.
The carcasses chosen to be sampled were the first pro-
cessed at the slaughterhouse on each collection day.

In-plant sampling locations

Carcass sampling was carried out at three steps in the
processing line: first collection point (P1) was on the hide
after bleeding but before hide opening and subsequent hide
removal; second collection point (P2) was on the carcass
after hide removal but before evisceration; and third collec-
tion point (P3) was the half-carcass but before the final
washing (Figure 1). The same carcass was sampled at P1,
P2 and P3.

Figure 1 - Flowchart of the slaughter line at the Brazilian slaughterhouse:
P1, first collection point; P2, second collection point; P3, third collection
point.

Carcass sampling areas

Each carcass was sampled on four regions, i.e. two re-
gions on the right side and other two regions on the left side
of the brisket (Figure 2). The area sampled in each region
was 100 cm2, resulting in a total area of 400 cm2 sampled.
This sampling method was carried out at each one of the
three different collection points (P1, P2 and P3). Plain cel-
lulose washing-up sponges (5 x 7 cm; 0.2 cm thickness)
containing no antimicrobial additives were sterilized by
autoclaving for 15 min at 1 atm and used for sampling. Just
before sampling, each cellulose sponge was moistened with
10 mL of sterile saline peptone solution (0.1% bacteriologi-
cal peptone; 0.85% NaCl) and then placed in a sterile plas-
tic bag. The carcasses were sponge-swabbed by ten consec-
utive passes at each of the four collecting areas using one
cellulose sponge for each sampling region. After sampling,
the four cellulose sponges from each point were placed in
the same plastic bag and transported under refrigeration

Isolation and enumeration of Salmonellaspp.

An aliquot of 40 mL of the saline peptone solution
was centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 min and the sediment was
used to investigate the presence of Salmonella spp.

According to the ISO 6579:2002 method (ISO, 2002),
each sediment was incubated in 100 mL of buffered pepto-
ne water (Oxoid, São Paulo, Brazil) for 18-24 h at 37 °C.
Subsequently, 1 mL was transferred to 10 mL of Muller
Kauffmann tetrathionate - novobiocin broth (MKTTn,
Oxoid) and 0.1 mL was transferred to 10 mL of Rappaport-
Vassiliadis Broth with soya (RVS, Oxoid) and incubated at
37 °C and 42.5 °C, respectively, for 24 h. Then, both
Xylose Lysine Deoxycholate agar (XLD, Oxoid) and Man-
nitol Lysine Crystal Violet Brilliant Green agar (MLCB,
Oxoid) plates were inoculated with aliquots of the cultures
from RVS and MKTTn. All the plates were incubated at
37 °C for 24 h. Suspect colonies (red with or without a
black center from XLD; mauve colored colonies with a
black center from MLCB) were purified on a Nutrient agar.
Then, biochemical recommended tests and serology by ag-
glutination with Poly O antisera (Probac, São Paulo, Brazil)
were carried out to confirm the result (MacFaddin, 2000).
After these tests, Salmonella spp. isolates were forwarded
to the Laboratório de Enterobactérias of the Instituto
Oswaldo Cruz (Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil) for serotyping.
To enumerate Salmonella spp., 0.1 mL of the first di-
lution was spread-plated on XLD agar (Oxoid, São Paulo,
Brazil). The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Red
colonies with or without black centers were counted and
later confirmed by biochemical tests.

Antimicrobial susceptibility test

Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents was tested us-
ing the disk diffusion method on Muller-Hinton agar
(Oxoid, São Paulo, Brazil) plates according to the National
Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (National
Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, 2010). The
following 15 antimicrobial agents were examined against
Salmonella isolates: ampicillin (10 mg), cefoxitin (30 mg),
cephalothin (30 mg), cefotaxime (30 mg),
imipenem
(10 mg), chloramphenicol (30 mg), amikacin (30 mg), genta-
micin (10 mg), kanamycin (30 mg), streptomycin (10 mg),
nalidixic acid (30 mg), ciprofloxacin (5 mg), tetracycline
(30 mg), trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (25 mg), and sul-
fonamides (300 mg). The diameters of the zones of inhibi-
tion were recorded to the nearest millimeter and classified
as susceptible, intermediate and resistant.

Measurement of the levels of free residual chlorine
in the washing animal water

The levels of free residual chlorine in the animal
washing water were provided by the Inspection Service of
the slaughterhouse. The values were measured at the begin-
ning of each slaughter process. The measurement was done

(< 7 °C), within 2 h, to the Food Microbiology and Control
Laboratory of Food Science and Technology Institute
(ICTA/UFRGS) to be analyzed.

Homogenization of the samples

After the arrival of the samples at the Laboratory,
200 mL of saline peptone solution was added to each plastic
bag. The plastic bag was repeatedly squeezed manually for
1 min and further decimal dilutions were made with saline
solution to carry out E. coli analysis.

Enumeration of Escherichia coli

The 3M Petrifilm E. coli/Coliform Count Plates (3M,
Sumaré, Brazil) were used to enumerate E. coli. From each
appropriate decimal dilution, 1 mL was removed, inocu-
lated on a Petrifilm plate and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C.
Blue colonies with gas production were counted.

Enumeration of Escherichia coli

Statistical analysis

E. coli and Salmonella spp. counts were calculated
per 100 cm2 and converted to log counts before statistical
analysis. The mean values were calculated and the analysis
of variance (ANOVA) and a Tukey test were carried out to
compare the differences between the mean values. The dif-
ferences were considered significant with p values less than
0.05. For the Salmonella spp. analysis, data were reported
as the percentage of samples positive for the pathogen. Sal-
monella prevalence distribution was modeled and used as
an output to simulate the probability of contamination (P).
The simulations were carried out using @Risk program stu-
dent version number 5.7, with 10,000 interactions. Preva-
lence distribution was simulated using binomial distribu-
tion considering positive samples (x) and the sample
number (n). Beta distribution was used to calculate the
probability of contamination by Salmonella, considering
the uncertainties of the sampling (b and a factors). For this
purpose we followed the formula below:

p = b(x + 1, n - x + 1)

where p is the probability, x is the number of positive sam-
ples for Salmonella spp., n is the number of carcasses sam-
pled.

The general mean values of E. coli were 2.57, 0.46
and 0.40 log cfu/100 cm2 at P1, P2 and P3, respectively.
There were significant differences in counts observed in P1
and P2 and P1 and P3, but no significant difference was ob-
served between the counts of P2 and P3. The low counts in
P2 and P3 could possibly be explained due to proper hide
removal and the fact that carcass tissues are considered
sterile. The significant reduction in counts when P1 was
compared with the other two points and the low counts ob-
served in P2 and P3 could indicate that manufacturing prac-
tices were adequate during processing in the slaughter-
house.

The counts of E. coli on animal hides (P1) ranged
from 0.31 to 5.07 log cfu/100 cm2 (Table 1). The high vari-
ability in E. coli counts at P1 could be explained by the dif-
ferent geographic origin of the animals, the age of animals,
cleanliness of hides and breeds of animals (Antic et al.,
2010; Davies et al., 2000; Hancock et al., 1997; Mcevoy et
al., 2000). Other studies reported higher E. coli counts on
hides than the results obtained in this study. For example,
Bacon et al. (2000) had higher mean values of E. coli rang-
ing from 5.5 to 7.5 log cfu/100 cm2. Arthur et al. (2004)
have demonstrated higher mean values of E. coli on animal
hides in two commercial fed-beef processing plants. The
counts ranged from 6.6 to 8.0 log cfu/100 cm2 in one of the

plants and 4.9 to 5.8 log cfu/100 cm2 in the other plant. The
microbiological loads of incoming cattle are important be-
cause the external hide is a primary source of fecal contami-
nation, which can be eventually transferred to the underly-
ing sterile carcass tissue (Bacon et al., 2000).

The results obtained for E. coli at P2 showed a maxi-
mum value of 2.42 log cfu/100 cm2. Arthur et al. (2004) re-
ported similar results examining 288 beef carcasses in the
USA. On the other hand, Bacon et al. (2000) found higher
mean values ranging from 2.6 to 5.3 cfu/100 cm2 analyzing
beef carcasses in the USA. In the present study, the micro-
biological loads at P2 probably reflected the extent of the
microbiological contamination originating from the hide,
since beef carcass surfaces are generally sterile (Bacon et
al., 2000).

Analyzing counts obtained on different sampling
days, it could be observed that the fifth collection day
showed significantly higher counts (P1 = 5.07, P2 = 2.42
and P3 = 2.10 log cfu/100 cm2) for all three points, com-
pared to the other days, while the tenth collection day dem-
onstrated the lowest mean values. The reasons for these
differences were not explored in this study; however they
corroborate the idea that the higher the initial contamina-
tion, the greater the contamination of the final product. An-
other important result observed was the significant increase
between P2 and P3 on the ninth collection day. It could pos-
sibly be explained as a recontamination after evisceration
or another failure in processing.

The results indicated that there was no direct correla-
tion between the level of free chlorine in the water used to
wash the animals before slaughter and the mean values of
E. coli observed in P1. As an example, on the first sampling
day, the mean value of 1.93 log cfu/100cm2 was verified
with a free chlorine level of 5 ppm in water, however on the
twelfth collection day, a mean value of 2.16 log cfu/100cm2
was observed, whilst
the level of free chlorine was
0.65 ppm. Even though the chlorine level varied almost
9-fold, the bacterial counts were not significantly different.
These results may demonstrate that only washing the ani-
mal hide with chlorinated water does not necessarily im-
prove the microbial status of the hide. The risk of contami-
nation of the beef carcasses may still exist, if only this
practice is used. In order to improve microbiological qual-
ity, the use of multiple-sequential interventions, like pre-
and post-evisceration water washing, organic acid solution
rinsing and hot water washing could be possible measures
to decontaminate beef carcasses during the slaughtering
and dressing process (Bacon et al., 2000).

Isolation, enumeration and antimicrobial
susceptibility of Salmonellaspp.

The presence of Salmonella spp. was observed in
only four carcasses (3.3%), three sampled on the fifth col-
lection day and one carcass sampled on the eighth collec-
tion day. Salmonella spp. was only isolated in P1 from

animal hides. Reid et al. (2002) obtained similar results
showing a prevalence of 3.3% of Salmonella in 90 beef cat-
tle hides in the south-west of England. A much higher Sal-
monella prevalence (94.8%) was found by Arthur et al.
(2007) analyzing 288 beef cattle hides in the USA. Con-
versely, Antic et al. (2010) were not able to isolate Salmo-
nella spp. in any of the 40 animal hides sampled in one
abattoir in Serbia.

The low level of Salmonella contamination found in
this study could be explained by multiple factors. First, the
slaughtered cattle had different origins, coming from dif-
ferent farms that could easily have had differences in the
prevalence of this pathogen. Secondly, in Brazil, extensive
farming is the most prevalent kind of animal exploitation.
With this practice, direct contact among animals is very
low, which may help to avoid the transmission of Salmo-
nella. There are other factors that could explain the Salmo-
nella prevalence on beef carcasses, including those related
to the feed, animals, transport and the environment. All
those factors vary largely among countries and geograph-
ical regions.

The modeling of probability of contamination by Sal-
monella on P1 indicated values varying from 0.016% to
0.075% with mean numbers of 0.041%. These numbers
were calculated considering the uncertainty of the sam-
pling. Such values mean that in 90% of the sampling on
beef carcasses in this slaughter line probably at least 1.6%
and in the maximum of 7.5% of the carcasses may be posi-
tive for Salmonella. These prevalence values were consid-
ered low mainly considering that Salmonella was isolated
on animal hides.

Unlike of the hides, there was no Salmonella spp.
found at any of the other two points (P2 and P3) analyzed in
the present study, and these results were similar with those
found by Meyer et al. (2010) who examined 841 beef car-
casses in Germany. The absence of Salmonella at P2 and P3
and the low E. coli counts at these points demonstrated that
the hygienic conditions and manufacturing practices of the
slaughterhouses were adequate.

Six strains of Salmonella spp. were isolated in the
present study, and they were classified as three different
serovars. The most prevalent serovar was S. Newport,
which was found on three animals. The serovar S. Saintpaul
was found on two animals, while S. Anatum was identified
on only one animal.

It was not possible to enumerate Salmonella spp. in
the majority of the samples. This may have occurred be-
cause Salmonella was not present on the sampled surfaces
or because the amount of Salmonella present was too low to
be detectable. Other possibilities to explain this result are
the influence of background flora that could inhibit Salmo-
nella multiplication, giving a false negative result or the
low sensitivity of the method used to detect stressed cells
(Meyer et al., 2010).

22

Silva et al.

All the Salmonella spp. stains were susceptible to the
15 antimicrobials tested. This result is different to those ob-
served by Bacon et al. (2002) who have reported 69.4% of
49 Salmonella strains were resistant at least one antimi-
crobial tested. Stevens et al. (2006) obtained 99 isolated of
Salmonella spp. and the percentages of strains resistant to
nitrofurans, sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, chloramphe-
nicol and nalidixic acid were 36.7, 21.1, 14.1, 2 and 1%, re-
spectively.

The difference in the resistance profile observed in
this study and the others reported in the literature could be
explained by several factors, especially the type of farming.
Extensive farming of cattle has been the most prevalent
way of farming in Brazil. In this kind of farming, the use of
antimicrobials has been very low; therefore, there is no high
selective pressure on bacterial strains. On the other hand, in
some animal species, like swine, where animal farming has
been done of intensive way, the number of resistant strains
has been much higher. In this way of farming, due to the in-
tensification of production methods, many diseases related
to the introduced technologies have emerged. The control
of these diseases has been done by the use of antimicrobials
(Castagna et al., 2001).

A correlation between the presence of Salmonella and
the quantitative analysis of E. coli was not observed in this
study. Salmonella was detected on the fifth and in the
eighth collection days. However, the mean value of E. coli
on the fifth collection day was significantly higher than the
mean value of E. coli on the eighth collection day (p < 0.05).
In this study, the percentage of carcasses contaminated with
Salmonella and more than 2 log cfu/100 cm2 E. coli was
3.37%. However the percentage of carcasses with Salmo-
nella and less than 2 log cfu/100 cm2 E. coli was 3.23%.
These values did not present a statistically significant dif-
ference and these results indicated that there was no corre-
lation between the presence of Salmonella and the quantita-
tive analysis of E. coli. Ruby and Ingham (2009) have
suggested that the correlation would be better if the absence
of

In the present study, low levels of Salmonella and E.
coli were found on beef carcasses and also low probability
of contamination of the carcasses by Salmonella, suggest-
ing that adequate slaughter procedures were carried out in
the slaughterhouse analyzed. However, the isolation of
these microorganisms on the animal hides indicated that the
risk of the contamination still exists.
