Background: Salmonella is a common causative agent of food-borne illness in humans. 
Infection  by  this  pathogen  is  usually  due  to  ingestion  of  contaminated  insufficiently 
cooked foods. Despite the fact that several studies of the prevalence and antimicrobial 
resistance of Salmonella have been conducted in Thailand, there is limited data available 
concerning the more rural areas of the country. 
Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance pro-
files of Salmonella in meat and vegetable samples taken from Phatthalung Province, Thailand.
Materials and Methods: Pork and chicken meat and fresh vegetable samples were ran-
domly selected from retail markets in Phatthalung Province. Salmonella isolation and 
identification were performed on the same day of sample collection. Serovar typing was 
performed by slide agglutination according to The Kauffman and White scheme. Anti-
microbial susceptibility testing was performed by disc diffusion method, and antimicro-
bial susceptibility patterns were analyzed by the WHONET 5 program.
Results: The prevalence of Salmonella in retail pork, chicken meat, and fresh vegetables 
were 82% (34/41), 67.5% (27/40), and 46% (37/80), respectively. The Salmonella isolated from 
pork, and vegetables were most resistant to tetracycline (77 and 33%) while the Salmo-
nella isolated from chicken meat was most resistant to streptomycin (92%). Thirty-one 
samples  (68%)  isolated  from  pork  and  thirty-two  samples  (84%)  isolated  from  chicken 
meat were of MDR strains. whereas only 7 samples (29%) isolated from vegetables exhib-
ited resistance to two or more antimicrobial drugs.
Conclusions: These results show that retail meat and vegetables can serve as a reservoir 
of multiple antimicrobial resistant Salmonella and can probably be a potential route of 
transmission of these pathogens into human population.

 Implication for health policy/practice/research/medical education:
This study provides useful information on surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella and monitoring for preventing 
in food-borne disease at Phatthalung, Southern of Thailand. We have observed that retail meat (pork and chicken meat) and fresh 
vegetables can serve as a source for MDR strains of Salmonella that may affect to consumer health.

1. Background 

Salmonella is a common causative agent of food-borne 
illnesses  in  humans  and  a  growing  worldwide  public 
health  problem  (1,  2).  In  Thailand,  epidemiological  re-
ports indicate that Salmonella is encountered as the most 
common  cause  of  diarrhea,  which  is  widespread  in  all 
parts of the country (3). Salmonella is able to colonize in 
animal intestinal tracts, mainly swine and chicken, and 
shed in the feces (4-6). Therefore, Salmonella contamina-
tion in pork or chicken is unavoidable in the human food 
supply chain. Additionally, probably due to the use of ma-
nure fertilizer in their cultivation, Salmonella contamina-
tion can also be found in various types of vegetables (7). 
The illness is usually transmitted through food contami-
nated by feces. Furthermore, the resistance of Salmonella 
to a range of antimicrobial agents has become a serious 
global concern in public health. 

An  increasing  number  of  antimicrobial  resistant  Sal-
monella has been reported in both developed and devel-
oping countries. Recently, a study in Denmark reported 
that  the  frequency  of  quinolone-resistant  S.  Enteritidis 
has  increased  from  0.8%  in  1995  to  8.5%  in  2000  (8).  Ac-
cording  to  an  investigation  in  England  and  Wales  from 
2000  to  2004,  antimicrobial  resistant  S.  Enteritidis  has 
increased from 19% in 2000 to 35% in 2004, and antimi-
crobial  resistant  S.  Typhimurium  has  increased  from  82% 
in 2000 to 90% in 2002 (9). Moreover, a consequence of 
multidrug resistant (MDR) Salmonella infection has been 
previously reported, in which patients who were infected 
by  MDR  strain  of  S.  typhimurium  had  an  approximately 
10  times  higher  mortality  rate  than  general  population 
(10). To ensure adequate consumer protection, especially 
in urban areas, several methods for decreasing contami-
nation  have  been  implemented  in  animal  production 
and slaughtering system. In the countryside of Thailand, 
most animal and vegetable production is supplied for lo-
cal consumption and therefore, the issue of food safety 
and Salmonella contamination in food, animal products, 
and  vegetables  may  receive  insufficient  attention  in 
these areas.

2. Objectives

To reduce contamination and illness caused by Salmo-
nella infection, the prevalence of Salmonella contamina-
tion  and  antimicrobial  susceptibility  data  in  meat  and 
vegetable products must be monitored. Hence, the aims 
of this study were to investigate the prevalence and anti-
microbial resistance profiles of Salmonella found in con-
taminated pork, chicken meat, and vegetables in Phatth-
alung Province, Southern Thailand. 

3. Materials and Methods 
3.1. Samples 
Forty-one samples of pork, 40 samples of chicken meat, 

and  80  samples  of  fresh  vegetables  were  randomly  se-
lected from retail markets in Phatthalung Province dur-
ing  the  period  of  October  to  December  2010.  Samples 
were kept in separate sterile plastic bags, stored in cool 
boxes, and transported to laboratory on the same day of 
sample collection for isolation and identification of Sal-
monella.

3.2. Salmonella Isolation and Identification
Approximately 25 Grams of surface area of pork, chick-
en meat, and fresh vegetables were cut into small pieces 
by sterile scissors before being added to a stomach bag 
containing 225 mL of buffered peptone water (BPW) and 
incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours. Subsequently, 100 µL and 
5 mL of pre-enriched cultures were transferred to Modi-
fied  Semi-solid  Rappaport-Vassiliadis  (MSRV)  medium 
(Criterion, U.S.A) and Rappaport Vassiliadis (RV) broth, re-
spectively and incubated at 42 °C for 24 hours. Then, one 
loopful from each of the enriched broths were streaked 
onto  Xylose  Lysine  Desoxycholate  (XLD)  agar  (Himedia, 
India)  plates  and  incubated  at  37  °C for  18  to  24  hours. 
At least 5 single typical colonies of Salmonella were ran-
domly picked up and stabbed into Triple Sugar Iron (TSI) 
agar (Criterion, U.S.A) and Lysine Indole Motile (LIM) me-
dium (Himedia, India) and incubated at 37 °C for 18 to 24 
hours. Typical characteristics of Salmonella exhibited on 
TSI agar were selected to subculture on Tryptic Soy (TSA) 
agar  (Himedia,  India).  Suspected  Salmonella  colonies 
were  confirmed  by  biochemical  reactions  (motility,  in-
dole production, lysine decarboxylase and carbohydrate 
fermentation) and slide agglutination with Salmonella O 
antigen antiserum. Final confirmation test was obtained 
through Salmonella serotyping performed by slide agglu-
tination with O and H Salmonella antisera (S&A reagent, 
Thailand).

3.3. Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing
All isolates were tested for 10 antimicrobial drugs (ox-
oids);  tetracycline  (30  µg),  ciprofloxacin  (5µg),  chlor-
amphenicol  (30  µg),  ampicillin  (10  µg),  norfloxacin  (10 
µg),  nalidixic  acid  (30  µg),  streptomycin  (10  µg),  trim-
ethoprim/sulfamethoxazole  (25  µg),  cephalothin  (30 
µg),  and  gentamicin  (10  µg).  Susceptibility  testing  was 
performed  according  to  recommendations  of  Clinical 
and  Laboratory  Standards  Institute  (CLSI)  (11).  To  stan-
dardize bacterial suspension (in 0.8% NaCl), the density 
of suspension was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland and spread 
over  the  entire  surface  of  Mueller  Hinton  agar  (MHA) 
plates  using  a  sterile  cotton  swab.  Antimicrobial  discs 
were placed on the agar surface followed by incubation 
of the plates at 37 °C for 24 hours. Inhibition zones were 
measured by Venire Caliper and interpreted accordingly 
by CLSI recommendations. The results were analyzed by 
WHONET 5 program.

4. Results 
4.1. Prevalence of Salmonella Serotypes in Samples 
Of  161  samples,  41  samples  were  prepared  from  retail 
pork,  40  samples  from  chicken  meat,  and  80  samples 
from fresh vegetables. The prevalence of Salmonella con-
tamination  in  retail  pork,  chicken  meat,  and  fresh  veg-
etables  were  82%  (34/41),  67.5%  (27/40),  and  46%  (37/80), 
respectively.  Among  all  positive  samples,  45  isolates,  38 
isolates,  and  29  isolates  of  Salmonella  were  segregated 
from  pork,  chicken  meat,  and  vegetables,  respectively. 
The  most  predominant  serotypes  isolated  from  pork, 
chicken meat, and fresh vegetables were S. Rissen (28.8%), 
S. albany (44.7%), and S. Typhimurium (33.3%), respectively. 
Frequency of isolated serotypes from pork, chicken meat, 
and vegetables is presented in Table 1.

4.2. Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing and Multi Drug 
Resistance Profiles 
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for 
all isolates. The results revealed that Salmonella isolated 
from  pork  were  mostly  resistant  to  tetracycline  (77%), 
streptomycin  (71%),  and  ampicillin  (51%).  For  Salmonella 
isolated  from  chicken  samples,  highest  resistance  was 
observed  against  streptomycin  (92%)  followed  by  nali-
dixic  acid  (76%),  ampicillin  (68%),  and  chloramphenicol 
(68%).  Despite  of  meat  samples,  fewer  antimicrobial  re-
sistant  Salmonella  were  observed  in  vegetable  samples, 
mostly  resistant  to  tetracycline  (33%)  followed  by  ampi-
cillin (20%) and streptomycin (20%). All antimicrobial re-
sistance profiles in Salmonella isolated from each sample 
are presented in Table 2.

Antimicrobial Resistance in Salmonella enterica

In addition, all Salmonella isolated were analyzed for mul-
tiple drugs resistance profiles, and it was revealed that in 
thirty-one pork samples (68%) several isolates were of MDR 
strains,  mostly  S.  weltevreden.  Thirty-two  samples  (84%) 
isolated from chicken were of the MDR strains, mostly S. 
albany.  However,  only  7  samples  (29%)  isolated  from  veg-
etables exhibited resistance to two or more antimicrobial 
drugs. Distribution of serotypes and multiple antimicro-
bial resistance patterns pertaining to pork, chicken meat, 
and vegetables are presented in Table 3.

5. Discussion

The  problems  attributed  to  Salmonella  infection  have 
increased  significantly,  in  terms  of  both  incidence  and 
severity. Furthermore, an increase of antimicrobial resis-
tance in this pathogen makes the treatment of infection 
more difficult that probably results in death. Therefore, 
epidemiological  information  and  monitoring  systems 
are  necessary  to  control  Salmonella  infection  in  public 
health sector. In this study, we observed prevalence and 
antimicrobial  susceptibility  patterns  of  Salmonella  iso-
lated from pork, chicken meat, and vegetables. The study 
showed that the retail pork was highly contaminated by 
Salmonella,  followed  by  chicken  meat  and  fresh  vegeta-
bles. These products, according to many reports, are the 
resources of Salmonella contamination (1, 2, 12, 13). 

Serotyping  of  Salmonella  isolated  from  pork  indicated 
that  S.  Rissen  was  the  most  predominant  serotype  fol-
lowed by S. weltevreden, whereas S. albany and S. typhimuri-
um  were  the  most  predominant  serotyping  found  in 
chicken meat and vegetables, respectively. Our results are 
inconsistent  with  previous  findings  in  Thailand  which 
indicated  that S. albany and S. give were predominantly 
found in swine and chicken farms, respectively (14). The 
inconsistency  in  observed  serotypes  may  be  attributed 
to different areas studied and sample types used in this 
investigation. Although serotyping were not the same as 
in other studies, those that were observed were included 
within  25  most  common  serotyping  isolated  from  hu-
man and other sources in Thailand (15). 

High contamination of Salmonella implies that hygienic 
performance in carcass production processes , especially 
in  slaughters  of  Phattalung  Province  area,  probably  are 
insufficiently attended. Antimicrobial susceptibility test-
ing  revealed  high  resistance  rates  against  several  anti-
microbial  drugs  used  in  both  medical  and  agricultural 
fields. Salmonella isolated from pork samples were com-
monly  resistant  to  tetracycline,  ampicillin,  and  strepto-
mycin, as was in those isolated from chicken, which were 
additionally  resistant  to  nalidixic  acid.  High  resistance 
to those antimicrobial drugs were consistent to previous 
observations  from  various  countries  (16-18),  which  im-
plies that the wide consumption of such antimicrobials 
as feed additives in livestocks contributes to emergence 
and  dissemination  of  resistance  in  Salmonella.  In  addi-

tion, it had also been reported the sub-therapeutic doses 
of antimicrobial drugs in animal husbandry as a respon-
sible factor in emergence and maintenance of multiple 
antimicrobial resistant pathogenic bacteria (19-21). 

According to several reports, our results demonstrated 
that  the  fluoroquinolone  groups  such  as  ciprofloxacin 
and norfloxacin are still the most effective drugs to treat 
Salmonella  infection  (22-24).  In  recent  years,  evidence 
for  decreasing  susceptibility  to  fluoroquinolones  in 
Salmonella  has  been  reported.  Increasing  resistance  to 
fluoroquinolones  is  growing  as  an  issue  receiving  spe-
cial attention, since fluoroquinolones are effective drugs 
against  Salmonella  in  clinical  performance  and  are  usu-
ally considered as treatment of choice in life threatening 
cases (25). Our study found that Salmonella isolated from 
fresh  vegetables  were  different  from  meat  samples  in 
both serotype distributions and antimicrobial resistance 
patterns.  This  imply  that  contamination  in  vegetable 
samples may originate from environmental sources that 
are different from animal contamination. However, this 
study indicated that retail meat and animals can serve as 
a source for MDR strains of Salmonella that may transfer 
to  vegetables.  Association  or  cross  contamination  be-
tween meat and vegetable samples is subject to further 
evaluations.
