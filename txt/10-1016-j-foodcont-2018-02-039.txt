Abstract

This study was carried out to determine the prevalence, antibiotic resistance, resistance genes and 

class  1  integrons  of  Salmonella  serovars  in  raw  leafy  vegetables,  chicken  carcasses  and  related 

environments.  From  April  2015  to  May  2016,  a  total  of  642  samples  collected  from  fresh  food 

markets in Peninsular Malaysia were examined. The overall occurrence of Salmonella species was 

29.1% (187/642) with 37 different serovars detected. The most prevalent serovars were S. Corvallis 

(49/187),  S.  Brancaster  (28/187),  S.  Albany  (17/187),  S.  Weltevredent  (15/187),  S.  Hvittingfoss 

(6/178),  S.  Paratyphi  B  (6/178)  and  S.  Typhimurium  (6/178).  Among  the  Salmonella  isolates,  the 

highest  antibiotic  resistance  was  to  streptomycin  (66.6%),  followed  by  tetracycline  (44.4%), 

sulfonamides 

(44.4%),  ampicillin 

(26.7%), 

chloramphenicol 

(29.1%)  and 

trimethoprim-

sulfamethoxazole (16.6%). All isolates of Salmonella were 100% susceptible to cephalothin. Fifty-five 

percent of the isolates (103/187) were multidrug resistant. The multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) 

index of Salmonella serovars ranged from 0.08 to 0.83, and the most prevalent resistance pattern 

was STeS₃. Eleven out of 16 resistant genes (tetA, tetB, blaTEM-1, temB, strA, strB, aadA, sulI, sulII, floR 

and cmlA) were detected among the resistant Salmonella isolates. None of the isolates was positive 

for tetC, tetG, cat1 and cat2. Seventeen isolates harboured class 1 integrons, which were grouped 

into  5  different  integrons  profiles  (IPs).  DNA  sequencing  analyses  have  identified  dfrA1,  dfrA12, 

aadA2, blaPSE−1, dfrA12-orf-aadA2 arrays of cassettes in variable regions on class 1 integrons. 

1.  Introduction

       Salmonella is one of the most important foodborne pathogens worldwide (Kirk et al., 2015; Fei 

et al., 2017), causing as many as million cases of typhoid fever, billion cases of gastroenteritis and

thousands of death each year (Bhunia, 2008). The estimated economic burden due to Salmonella 

infections  from  all  sources  costs  about  3.7  billion  USD  per  year  in  the  United  States  (ERS-USDA, 

2013). In Malaysia, although Salmonellosis is not a notifiable disease, the incidence of Salmonella 

isolated from humans has doubled in the past decade (Thong et al., 2016). Although Salmonella has 

been isolated from several sources, human Salmonellosis is most often linked to the consumption of 

contaminated poultry and poultry products (Fearnley et al., 2011), pork (Prendergast et al., 2009), 

beef (Zhao et al., 2008), fish (Kramarenko et al., 2014), vegetables (Sant’Ana et al., 2011), and non-

pasteurized dairy products (Langer et al., 2012). The increasing prevalence trend across the world 

(Pui  et al.,  2011)  and  growing  number  of  vegetables  and  poultry  related  outbreaks  (Guran  et  al., 

2017; CDC, 2015), have warranted the need for periodic surveillance of foods and environment in 

order to prevent human Salmonellosis. These pathogens pose an imminent risk to public safety not 

only due to its occurrence but also because many strains are resistant to a number of antimicrobial 

agents (Hur et al., 2012).

       

The  extensive  use  of  antimicrobials  by  humans  and  in  livestock  production  has  led  to 

antimicrobial  resistance  (AMR)  among  several  bacterial  strains.  Multidrug-resistant  (MDR) 

Salmonella enterica in foods have been previously reported in some parts of the world (Miko et al., 

2005;  Van  et  al.,  2007).  Salmonella isolates  from  Malaysia  and  other  countries  have  shown  an 

increased  proportion  in  the  number  of  multidrug-resistance  (Thong  and  Modarressi,  2011).   The 

isolation 

of 

fluoroquinolones, 

quinolones 

and 

extended-spectrum 

cephalosporins 

resistant Salmonella  was  of  particular  concern  because  these  antibiotics  are  widely  used  for 

treatment in medicine (Hur et al., 2012; Health Canada, 2009).

        Contamination  of  food  with  MDR  Salmonella  is  a  major  public  health  problem,  as  resistance 

traits  located  on  mobile  genetic  elements  can  easily  be  conveyed  to  other  bacteria  of  clinical 

significance  (Thong  and  Modarressi,  2011; Van  et  al.,  2007).  The  mechanisms  of  antimicrobial 

resistance  can  be  due  to  several  factors, including  changes  in  bacterial  cell  wall  permeability,

modification of the site of drug action, energy-dependent removal of antimicrobials via membrane-

bound efflux pumps and destruction or inactivation of antimicrobials (Chen et al., 2004).

         Antimicrobial resistance genes are mainly found on mobile genetic elements like transposons, 

integrons, and plasmids (Canal et al., 2016). A strong relationship between the presence of integrons 

and increased resistance to numerous antibiotics has been reported (Moura et al., 2007; Van et al., 

2007). On top of that, four distinct classes of integrons encoding different integrase gene sequences 

have  also  been  investigated  (Mazel,  2006).  Among  them,  Class  1  integrons  found  to  be  the  most 

important  contributor  to  MDR  in  Gram  negative  enteric  bacteria  and  play  a  major  role  in 

disseminating antimicrobial resistance genes (Krauland, 2009). Likewise, Class 1 integrons are very 

frequent in MDR Salmonella (Khemtong and Chuanchuen, 2008). Moreover, in Malaysia, due to high 

consumption of green leafy vegetables, chicken meat and increasing antimicrobial resistance in non-

typhoidal  Salmonella 

(Van  et  al.,  2012), 

the  prevalence  and  antibacterial 

resistance 

of Salmonella spp.  in  vegetables  and  the  broiler  chicken  sold  at  the  retail  point  need  to  be 

monitored.

The objective of our study was to determine the prevalence of Salmonella serovars from raw leafy 

vegetables, chickens carcasses and their related processing environments in Malaysian fresh food 

markets. Salmonella serovars isolated were also examined for antibiotic resistance, resistance genes, 

and Class 1 integrons.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sample collection

A total of 642 no-repeat samples of raw leafy vegetables (405/642), chicken carcasses (35/642) and 

their related processing environments (202/642) were obtained from fresh food markets in selected 

states of Peninsular Malaysia (Penang, Kedah, Perlis and Selangor) during the period of April 2015 to

tricolor),  Chinese  flowering  cabbage  (Brassica  rapa  var.  Parachinensis),  coriander  (Coriandrum 

sativum), lettuce salad (Lactuca sativa), amaranth green (Amaranthus tricolor), spring onion (Allium 

fistulosum),  winged  bean  (Psophocarpus  tetragonolobus),  laksa  leaves  (Poligonum  minus),  Indian 

pennywort (Centenella asiatica), iceberg lettuce (Lactuca sativa), mint (Mentha arvensis),  Japanese 

parsley (Oenanther stolonifera), wild parsley (Cosmos caudatus), water spinach (Ipomoea aquatic) 

and sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum) and were collected in sterile plastic bags. For chicken cuts and 

whole chickens carcasses, the swab-sampling method described by Gill et al., (2005) was adopted by 

which the inner-outer surfaces of the chicken were swabbed using 3M™ Dry-Sponge-Sticks (USA). On 

the other hand, the environmental samples including transport crates, knifes, display tables, drums, 

defeathering  machines,  drain  crevices,  floors,  butcher  aprons,  chopping  board  and  cages  surface 

area  of  10  –  30  cm2  were  swabbed  using  the  3M™  Dry-Sponge-Sticks  as  per  manufacturer’s 

instruction  (https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/871382O/3m-sponge-stick.pdf).  Sterile  Schott 

Duran®  bottles  were  used  in  collecting  all  the  water  samples  (wash  water,  scalding  tank  water, 

bench water and drain water). Samples were delivered to the laboratory on ice in Polystyrene box 

and processed immediately upon arrival to the laboratory. 

2.2. Salmonella isolation and identification 

Detection and isolation of  Salmonella from samples were carried out according to ISO 6579:2002 

Horizontal  Method  (ISO,  2002).  Vegetable  samples  (25g),  swab  samples  (3M™  Dry-Sponge-Sticks) 

and  25 ml  of  water  samples  were  pre-enriched  in  225 ml  of  buffered  peptone  broth  and  were 

incubated for 24 ± 2 hrs at 37 ± 1 °C. Then, pre-enriched 0.1 ml and 1ml cultures were incubated in 

9.9 mL  of  Rappaport  Vassiliadis  Soy  Broth  (RVS)  at  42 ± 1 °C  and 9 ml  of  Muller-Kauffmann 

Tetrathionate-Novobiocin  (MKTTn)  broth  at  37 ± 1 °C  for  24 ± 2 hrs,  respectively.  Loopfuls  of  RVS 

cultures  were  streaked  onto  selective  agar  plates;  Xylose-lysine-tergitol  4  (XLT4),  Xylose  Lysine

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTDeoxycholate  Agar  (XLD)  and  Rambach  Agar  (RAM),  then  incubated  for  about  24 hrs  at  37 °C. 

Suspected Salmonella colonies were picked from each plate, purified and subjected to biochemical 

tests  (triple  sugar  iron,  lysine  iron  agar).  All  media  used  were  purchased  from  Merck,  Germany. 

Salmonella isolates were also serologically confirmed by using polyvalent O and H antisera (Remel 

Europe,  UK).  The  serotyping  of  Salmonella  isolates  were  done  at  Salmonella  reference  centre  at 

Public  Health  Laboratory,  of  Ipoh  district,  Perak,  Malaysia  according  to  Kauffmann  and  White 

Scheme (Grimont and Weill, 2007).

Kirby–Bauer agar disk diffusion method was used to evaluate antimicrobial susceptibility against a 

panel  of  12  antimicrobial  agents  as  suggested  by  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standard  Institute  (CLSI, 

2012).  These  antimicrobials  were  ampicillin  (10 μg),  amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid  (20/10 μg), 

chloramphenicol 

(30 μg),  gentamicin 

(10 μg), 

streptomycin 

(10 μg), 

tetracycline 

(30 μg), 

trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  (25 μg),  nalidixic  acid  (30 μg),  ciprofloxacin  (5 μg),  cephalothin 

(30 μg), kanamycin (30 μg) and sulfonamides (300 μg) (Oxoid, UK). Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) was 

used  as  a  control.  The  interpretation  for  the  zones  of  inhibition  was  in  accordance  with  CLSI 

guidelines (CLSI, 2012). The Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR) index was determined according to 

the method stated by Krumperman (1983).

2.4. Polymerase chain reaction for detection of resistance genes and Class 1 integrons

Crude DNA was prepared by direct boiling of a suspension of the cell lysates, as previously described 

by  Ahmad  et  al.  (2009).  Sixteen  pairs  of  oligonucleotides  primers  were  used  to  target  16 

antimicrobial  resistance  genes  that  confer  resistance  to  five  antimicrobial  agents,  including 

ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides and tetracycline. The primer sequences and 

PCR conditions are presented in Table 1. All PCR amplifications contain 1× Taq buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2,

gene cassettes. Selected amplified PCR products were verified by DNA sequencing. The amplicons 

were purified using a DNA purification kit (Qiagen, Germany) and sent to a commercial facility for 

sequencing (First Base Laboratories, Malaysia). The resulted sequences were aligned and confirmed 

using the GenBank database and BLAST program (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).

2.5. Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were done using SPSS 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL), and the chi-squared test 

was applied to assess any statistically significant (p<0.05) differences in the Salmonella prevalence 

data.

3.1. Prevalence of Salmonella species

       The  results  showed  that  all  32  varieties  of  samples  examined  were  contaminated  with 

Salmonella species. The overall prevalence of Salmonella serovars on leafy vegetables, on chicken 

carcasses and from related processing environments is shown in Table 2. A total of 187/642 (29.1%) 

samples  were  positive  for Salmonella,  of  which  87/405  (21.5%)  were  vegetable  samples,  17/35 

(48.0%) were chicken samples and 83/202 (41.0%) were environmental samples. The prevalence of 

Salmonella were significantly different between samples (P<0.05).

      In this study, the prevalence of Salmonella spp isolated from leafy vegetables was 21.5%. This 

data  was  consistent  with  previous  studies  reported  by  other  authors,  who  had  described  high

prevalence rates for this pathogen in raw vegetables including 34% in Malaysia (Salleh et al., 2003), 

29.1% in Brazil (Maistro et al., 2012) and 20.0% in Turkey (Aytac et al., 2010). Coriander had the 

highest prevalence (52.0%) of Salmonella, followed by lettuce salad (32.0%), water spinach (31.0%), 

amaranth  red  (28.0%),  bean  sprouts  (28.0%)  and  amaranth  green  (27.0%).  Salmonella  spp.  had 

previously  been  isolated  from  leafy  vegetables  and  other  fresh  produce  such  as  lettuce,  spinach, 

bean sprouts, parsley, watercress, cucumber and potatoes (Maistro et al., 2012; Aytac et al., 2010). 

Consumption  of  raw  or  minimally  process  leafy  vegetables  can  be  a  potential  source  of  human 

Salmonellosis in Malaysia. 

          The use of untreated animal manure from livestock can be a major source of environmental 

contamination with Salmonella spp. and some other foodborne pathogens may contaminate leafy 

vegetables  when  applied  during  plant  growing  (Kotzekidou  et  al.,  2016).  Moreover,  Salmonella  is 

shed into the soil directly by wildlife and livestock and can persist on the environment for months 

(Liu et al., 2013). Likewise, Indian pennywort (Centella) is a topsoil creeper, and soil can be a source 

of contamination if animal manure is used as fertilizer for the crop of this vegetable. 

           The water source for irrigation is one of the determining factors for the presence of pathogens 

in  vegetables  (Cooley  et  al.,  2014).  The  possibility  of  contamination  via  irrigation  is  increased,  as 

untreated wastewater is used for around 10% of crop irrigation (Anon, 2003). In the United States 

and  Senegal,  9%  and  35%  of  the  irrigation  water  samples  analyzed  were  contaminated  with 

Salmonella,  respectively  (Pachepsky  et  al.,  2011;  Ndiaye  et  al.,  2011).  In  addition,  a  number  of 

outbreaks  related  to  contaminated  irrigation  water  had  been  published.  In  2005,  iceberg  lettuce 

imported from Spain caused S. Typhimurium cases in Finland and UK after wastewater was used to 

irrigate the crop (Takkinen et al., 2005).

         Vegetables  such  as  Japanese  parsley  (Oenanther  stolonifera),  laksa  leaves  (Poligonum  minus) 

and  water  spinach  (Ipomoea  aquatic)  are  often  grown  around  swamps,  river  banks  and  irrigation 

ditches,  which  are  prone  to  contamination  by  refuse  waste  from  industry,  slaughter  houses  and

processing plants (Sallah et al., 2003). According to Brackett, (1994) contamination of vegetables at 

harvest  and  at  post-harvest  stages  (transportation,  processing,  packaging,  distribution  and  retail 

levels)  may  be  due  to  contaminated  harvesting  equipment,  poor  personal  hygiene,  inadequate 

sanitation in the processing plant and retail handling. Hence, in this current study, the relatively high 

rate  of  Salmonella  contamination  in  leafy  vegetables  in  the  fresh  food  markets  may  have  been 

attributed  to  cross-contamination  from  the  environment  where  the  vegetables  were  cultivated, 

prepared, handled by workers and consumers and stored.        

         In general, the prevalence of Salmonella was 48% for chicken carcasses and 41% for processing 

environmental samples obtained from fresh food markets (Table 2). The results were incomparable 

with the previous findings in Malaysia. Nidaullah et al. (2017) reported 88.46% of poultry carcasses 

and related processing environmental samples from the small-scale plants and fresh markets were 

contaminated with Salmonella. In addition, Modarressi and Thong (2010), reported a prevalence of 

72.7% of Salmonella in chicken meat samples around Klang Valley, Malaysia from 2006 to 2009. In 

another  study,  the  prevalence  of  Salmonella  in  broiler  carcasses  obtained  from  wet  markets  and 

processing  plants  was  35.5%  and  50.0%,  respectively  (Rusul  et  al.,  1996).  The  differences  in  the 

results of these studies might be due to sampling approaches and geographical locations. As in this 

study, samples were obtained from numerous processing stages of slaughtering to retailing at the 

fresh food markets. The focus was to find contamination sites and to identify the area of Salmonella 

dissemination  during  the  processing.  Among  the  studied  samples  (Table  2),  drain  water  had  the 

highest prevalence (76.0%) of Salmonella, followed by floors (67.0%), chopping board (53.0%), wash 

water  (53.0%),  display  tables  (50.0%),  chicken  cuts  (50.0%),  whole  chicken  (47.0%)  and  butcher 

aprons  (43.0%).  Salmonella contamination  was  relatively  high  in  our  study,  signifying  that  poultry 

meat  and  processing  environment  may  be  a  potential  vector  for  transmitting  Salmonella species. 

This shows that Salmonella had established itself in poultry processing environments and on carcass 

contact  surfaces  by  colonizing  the  equipment  surfaces  forming  biofilms  which  allows  for  longer 

survival. Besides, the formation of biofilms by Salmonella on contact surfaces is of major food safety 

9

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTconcern  due  to  greater  risk  for  cross-contamination  (Carrasco  et  al.,  2012).  The  existence  of  high 

humidity in the fresh food markets environment may attribute to the presence of pathogen biofilm 

on contact surfaces (Villa-Rojas et al., 2017). In most of the fresh food markets, chicken carcasses are 

sold at ambient temperatures and exposed to the environment with the lack of cooling system and 

ice is rarely used for chilling.

          In live birds, Salmonella is carried asymptomatically in the gastrointestinal tract and can merely 

transfer to carcasses in abattoir through faecal contamination. Further dissemination may perhaps 

occur during processing if the carcasses become cross-contaminated (Trongjit et al., 2017). As in this 

study, the live birds are mostly slaughtered, processed and retailed in the market without inspection 

by the authority, and extensive human handling during each processing step almost certainly lead to 

cross contamination.

S.  Djugu,  S.  Gamira,  S.  Haifa,  S.  Kastrup,  S.  Kentucky,  S.  Lindenburg,  S.  Minnesota,  S.  Mkamba,  S.

different  Salmonella  serovars  were  isolated  from  chicken  carcasses  and  19  from  processing 

environments.

        The  pattern  of  serovars  distribution  is  quite  different  as  S.  Weltevredent  was  the  dominant 

serovar in leafy vegetables, followed by S. Corvallis, S. Brancaster, S. Paratyphi B and S. Hvittingfoss. 

This  is  particularly  similar  to  the  findings  by  Salleh  et  al.  (2003),  in  which  they  reported  S. 

247 Weltevredent as the predominant serovar isolated from raw leafy vegetables in the Central region of 

248 Malaysia.  In  addition,  between  1983–1992,  Salmonella  Weltevredent  was  third  most  prevalent

serovar isolated in the human clinical cases in Malaysia (Yasin et al., 1997). S. Weltevredent is an 

emerging  pathogen  and  increasingly  being  reported  as  a  cause  of  invasive  bacterial  disease  and 

diarrhoea in the human population residing in the tropical regions of low income countries (Makendi 

et al., 2016). This is of serious concern because S. Weltevredent had been reported to be the cause 

of  Salmonellosis 

in  Scandinavia,  Malaysia  and  Southeast  Asia  (Learn-Han  et  al.,  2008; 

Bangtrakulnonth et al. 2004; Padungtod and Kaneene, 2006).

          On  another  note,  the  detection  of  S.  Paratyphi  B,  S.  Typhimurium  and  S.  Enteritidis  in 

vegetables should have similarly raised concern to us because these serovars have been linked to 

numerous  outbreaks  of  foodborne  Salmonellosis  worldwide  (Pui  et al.,  2011;  Kirk  et  al.,  2015). 

Salmonella  Paratyphi  B  has  wide  geographical  distribution  and  has  been  isolated  from  different 

sources  causing  enteric  fever  and  self-limiting  gastroenteritis  in  humans  (Chart  et  al.,  2005).  In 

260 Malaysia, the epidemiological knowledge of S. Paratyphi B is relatively scarce as compared to well-

261

262

263

264

known serovars like Typhimurium and Enteritidis. Only two studies reported S. Paratyphi B as the 

second  leading  serovar  isolated  from  children  hospitalized  with  extra-intestinal  non-typhoidal 

Salmonellosis and those with non-typhoid gastroenteritis in Malaysia (Lee et at., 2000). However, 

several reports of increasing incidence of S. Paratyphi B in Canada and Italy (Stratton et al., 2001; 

265 Miko  et  al.,  2002)  show  that  this  serovar  will  be  significant  in  near  future.  The  isolation  of six  S. 

11

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT266

267

268

269

Paratyphi  B  from  different  vegetables  should  not  be  underestimated,  particularly  in  those  lightly 

cooked or eaten raw.

         Some  serovars  may  have  epidemiological  importance  in  certain  geographical  locations.  For 

instance, S. Mbandaka has been noted to emerge in the Poland, the UK and Australia (Hoszowski and 

270 Wasyl, 2001; Reid et al., 1993; Scheil, Cameron et al., 1998). To our knowledge, this is the second 

271

time  S.  Hvittingfoss  had  been  isolated  from  vegetables  obtained  from  the  fresh  food  markets  in 

272 Malaysia as previously reported in 2003. An outbreak of S. Hvittingfoss associated with consumption 

273

274

of rockmelon has been reported in Australia in 2016 (Food Safety News, 2016). A noteworthy finding 

of several Salmonella serovars such as S. Augustenborg, S. Cerrot, S. Djugu, S. Dumfries, S. Kastrup, S. 

275 Minnesota, S. Newport, S. Planckendael, S. Obugu, S. Ohio, S. Redhill, S. Richmond and S. Stanley to

mention  a  few  is  that  these  Salmonella  serovars  are  among  those  isolated  from  vegetables  but 

infrequently reported in the Far East, particularly in Malaysia. The diversity of vegetables and study 

locations have influenced the occurrence of many serovars obtained in this present study.

          On  chicken  carcasses  and  the  related  processing  environments,  the  majority  of  occurring 

serovars  were  S.  Corvallis,  S.  Brancaster  and  S.  Albany.  The  Salmonella serovars  identified  in  our 

study  are  in  conformity  with  that  of  reported  by  Nidaullah  et  al.  (2017),  in  which  S.  Corvallis,  S. 

Brancaster and S. Albany were major serovars from wet markets and poultry processing plant. These 

may be due to result of microbial adhesion and biofilm formation on equipment contact surfaces 

such  as  cutting  board,  knife,  scalding  tank  water,  chilling  tank,  and  defeathering  machines  which 

allow these Salmonella serovars to be persistent for a longer period of time in biofilm and they tend 

to protect the pathogens from sanitizers and detergents. Likewise, Strawn et al. (2014) stated that 

certain Salmonella serovars may be more common in certain areas, probably due to persistence or 

adaptation  to  specific  hosts  or  abiotic  environment  found  in  a  given  geographical  location.  In 

another study, 14 different Salmonella serovars were isolated from chicken carcasses obtained from

retail outlets in Malaysia, with S. Muenchen (32.6%), S. Enteritidis (19.8%), S. Kentucky (17%), and S. 

Blockley (12.8%) as the major serovars (Rusul et al., 1996).  

3.3. Antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella isolates

         The resistance of Salmonella isolates to 12 antimicrobial agents examined is shown in Table 4. 

In total, 19 and 15 Salmonella isolates (10.2 and 8.0%) were resistant to one and two antibiotics, 

respectively.  In  addition,  103  isolates  of  Salmonella  (55.1%)  were  multi-drug  resistant  (MDR) 

(resistance to 3 or more antimicrobials). MDR Salmonella isolates have been reported to be more 

virulent than non-multiple drug-resistant (Foley et al., 2008). This level of MDR Salmonella isolates 

was lower than that of previously reported by Thong and Moderassi (2011) in Malaysia (67%). In 

another study, the level of MDR Salmonella isolates was reported in Vietnam (34%) by Van et al. 

(2007)  and  in  Morocco  (44%)  by  Bouchrif  et  al.  (2009).  Notably,  16  different  Salmonella  serovars 

were observed among the multidrug-resistant isolates.

             In the present study, high prevalence of resistance was observed for streptomycin (66.6%), 

tetracycline 

(44.4%),  sulfonamides 

(44.4%),  ampicillin 

(26.7%),  chloramphenicol 

(29.1%), 

trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (11.6%), nalidixic acid (12.8%) and kanamycin (11.2%). All isolates of 

Salmonella  were  susceptible  to  cephalothin.  In  comparison,  these  findings  are  similar  to  earlier 

reports showing that  Salmonella isolates in vegetables, chicken and processing environment were 

resistant to many antimicrobials, including tetracycline, streptomycin, sulfonamides and ampicillin 

(Learn-Han  et  al.,  2008).  Much  of  the  resistant  isolates  were  from  poultry  and  environmental 

samples as compared to vegetables. In poultry, the emergence of antimicrobial resistant Salmonella 

isolates  may  be  a  result  of  widespread  use  of  antibiotics  for  growth  promotion,  therapeutic  and 

prophylactic uses in local poultry production in Malaysia. These isolates can then be transferred to 

vegetables via the use of faeces from poultry houses as manure on vegetable farms. Even though 

application  of  antibiotic  in  livestock's  production  is  under  strict  veterinary  supervision  in  most

countries, farmers are still using antibiotics as prophylactic in intensive farming units, mainly poultry, 

cattle and pigs without prescription (Usera et al., 2002).

         A  number  of  Salmonella  isolates  from  vegetables  in  this  study  were  also  resistant  to  a  few 

antimicrobials  agents,  including  streptomycin  (36.8%),  sulfonamides  (25.3%),  tetracycline  (19.5%), 

ampicillin (13.8%) and chloramphenicol (10.3%). Although a number of antibiotics used in vegetable 

farming are modest (Schwaiger et al., 2011), primary sources for the spread of resistant bacteria into 

the  field  were  considered  to  be  pesticides  application,  emission  of  residues  from  wastewater 

treatment, antibiotic manufacturing and irrigation of crop with contaminated water (Brandl, 2006). 

According to Segura et al. (1999), the formation of multidrug efflux systems from heavy metals and 

plant metabolites can result in antibiotic resistance.

         The antimicrobial resistance profile and MAR index of the Salmonella serovars are presented in 

Table 5.  One  hundred  and  thirty-seven  Salmonella  isolates  belonging  to  25  different  serovars 

exhibited 51 different antibiogram patterns. S. Brancaster exhibited 20 different resistant patterns to 

the antibiotics examined whereas various different resistant patterns were also shown by S. Albany, 

S.  Corvallis,  S.Weltevreden,  S.  Give,  S.  Hvittingfoss,  S.  Indiana,  S.  Typhimurium,  S.  Enteritidis,  S. 

330 Mbandaka,  S.  Paratyphi,  S.  Stanley  and  S.  Dumfries,  respectively.  The  most  prevalent  resistance 

pattern  was  STeS₃  and  exhibited  by  S.  Corvallis  (28),  S.  Mbandaka  (3),  S.  Typhimurium  (1)  and  S. 

Djugu (1). One S. Albany isolated from chopping board was resistant to 10 antibiotics and had the 

highest MAR index of 0.83. One isolate of each S. Give and S. Weltevredent and 3 of S. Albany were 

resistant to 8 antibiotics with a high MAR index of 0.66. Eight and 7 isolates were resistant to 7 and 6 

antibiotics  with  MAR  index  of  0.58  and  0.50,  respectively.  The  emergence  of  Salmonella  serovars 

having MAR Index of more than 0.2 originated from an environment where several antibiotics are 

used more often as therapeutic or feed additive in animals (Krumperman, 1983).

3.4. Antimicrobial resistance genes and class 1 integrons

         Eleven out of the 16 resistance genes (tetA, tetB, blaTEM-1, temB, floR, cmlA, aadA, strA, strB, su1 

and  sul2)  were  detected  in  drug-resistant  isolates  by  PCR  (Table  6).  A  comparison  of  the  DNA 

sequences of these amplicons showed 95–100% similar identity with the available sequences in the 

NCBI GenBank Database.      

          Out of the 117 streptomycin-resistant isolates, 38 harboured both strA and strB and only 32 

harboured the aadA genes. Along with these, 14 isolates had all the three genes. The strA-strB genes 

are widely disseminated in Salmonella and other Gram negative spp (Caratoliet al., 2008; Soudin, 

2002).  In  Malaysia,  strA-strB  and  aadA  were  detected  in  Salmonella  serovars  from  raw  beef  and 

chicken  meat  (Thong  and  Moderrasi,  2011).   The  use  of  streptomycin  for  treatment  had  been 

reduced  in  human  and  veterinary  medicine  but  the  persistence  might  be  caused  by  co-selection 

(Peirano et al., 2006). Of the 83 tetracycline-resistant isolates, tetA alone was found in 76 isolates 

and  3  were  positive  for  both  tetA/tetB,  respectively.  No  isolates  were  positive  for  tetC  and  tetG. 

Similar  to  tetA,  tetB  gene  is  widespread  among  Salmonella  and  has  been  located  on  transferable 

plasmids (Lopes et al., 2016), and is easily transferred (Roberts, 2005).

         Among the 83 sulphonamide-resistant isolates, 5 were positive for both sul1 and sul2, 7 were 

positive  for  sul1  and  47  were  positive  for  sul2  only.  These  genes  most  often  found  in  integron 

positive isolates that carried other genes (Mąka et al., 2015). In the United States and Canada, much 

of  the  isolated  MDR  Salmonella  enterica  from  humans,  animals  and  retail  meat  harboured  sul1 

(26/56) and sul2 (23/56) (Glenn et al., 2013).

        Twenty of the 41 chloramphenicol-resistant isolates harboured floR and 4 harboured cmlA only, 

whereas 4 (1 Albany, 2 Brancaster, and 1 Corvallis) serovars had both floR and cmlA. None of the 

chloramphenicol  acetyltransferase  genes, cat1 and cat2,  were  detected  in  the  chloramphenicol-

resistant Salmonella.  These  two  genes  (cmlA  and  floR)  are  very  much  related  to  and  encoded  in 

Chloramphenicol efflux pumps in Salmonella (Cabrera et al., 2004; White et al., 2001). In this study,

floR genes appear to be very prevalent in Salmonella, whereas cmlA was less widely distributed. This 

is  in  agreement  with  the  report  by  Thong  and  Modarressi  (2011),  stating  that  the  floR  gene  was 

detected  in  7  isolates  (6  Typhimurium,  1  Newport)  and cmlA was  detected  in  2  isolates  (serovars 

Istanbul and Wandsworth). Also in another study by Glenn et al. (2013), chloramphenicol resistance 

genes  including cat  (36/56),  floR (27/56)  and cmlA (7/56)  were  detected  in  Salmonella  enterica 

serovars isolated from retail meat, animals and humans.

      Out of 3 types of β-lactamase gene tested, 36 of 50 ampicillin-resistant isolates harboured both 

blaTEM-1 and temB. At the same time, only 14 had temB.  None of the temA was detected. In an earlier 

study  by  Benacer  et  al.  (2010),  it  was  reported  that  all  ampicillin-resistant  Salmonella  strains 

harboured blaTEM-1, temA, and temB.   In another similar study in Korea by Kim et al. (2013), temA 

(1.6%) and blaTEM-1 (95%) genes were detected in resistant isolates while temB was not detected.

           In  this  study,  class  1  integrons  were  detected  in  17  (12.4%)  resistant  Salmonella  isolates  (4 

from vegetables, 6 from chicken carcasses and 7 from the environment). Five integron profiles (IP) 

were  identified.  IP-1,  IP-3  and  IP-5  consist  of  one  integron  while  IP-2  and  IP-4  consist  of  two 

integrons each as shown in Table 7. Five amplicons, which were 0.3 kb, 0.5 kb, 1.5 kb, 0.3+1.2 kb, 

and 0.3+1.5 kb long were detected. In another study by Thong and Moderrasi (2011), they detected 

12 class 1 integrons amongst 59 MDR Salmonella isolates from retail meat and street foods. Three IP 

with variable amplicons were defined, which include IP-1 (0.7 kb) found in S. Typhimurium and S. 

382 Weltevreden,  IP-2  (1.2  kb)  in  S.  Newport  and  S.  Albany  and  IP-3  (1.5  kb)  in  S.  Agona  and  S. 

383

Typhimurium, respectively (Thong and Moderrasi, 2011).

          Based  on  the  DNA  sequence  examination  of  variable  regions  of  amplicons,  the  most 

predominant gene cassette arrays carried by these integrons were dfrA1 and dfrA12 genes encoding 

resistance  to  trimethoprim  (GenBank  accession  no.   KY965931),  and  aadA2 gene  encoding  for 

aminoglycoside  adenyltransferase  AAD  (3'')  and  confers  resistance  to  streptomycin-spectinomycin 

(accession  no.  KY965930).  In  addition,  a  0.3  +  1.0-kb  integron  contains  an aadA2 + blaPSE−1  gene 

cassette (accession no. KY965929) encoding resistance to aminoglycosides and beta-lactamase. The

Kentucky confers resistance to sulphonamides, trimethoprim and aminoglycosides which was similar 

to  our  finding  (Thong  and  Moderrasi,  2011).  Similar  gene  cassette  of  dfrA12-orf-aadA2  had  been 

found  in  1.9 kb  integrons  in  Thailand  from  serovars  Rissen,  Anatum,   Weltevreden,  Kentucky, 

Eppendorf, Stanley, Schwarzenrund and Typhimurium, (Khemtong and Chuanchuen, 2008), in Korea 

from  S.  Gallinarum  (Kwon  et  al.,  2002),  and  in  Taiwan  from  S.  Choleraesuis  (Hsu  et  al.,  2006). 

Identical  gene  cassette  could  be  found  from  the  same  and  different  bacterial  species  (Hsu  et  al., 

2006) which indicates that integrons can be transferred between intra- and inter-species and play 

significant roles in the spreading of antimicrobial resistance genes among bacteria.

4. Conclusions

In  summary,  our  results  had  confirmed  a  relatively  high  rate  of  Salmonella  contamination  from 

vegetables,  chicken  carcasses,  and  related  processing  environments  in  Malaysian  fresh  food 

markets. These might act as the reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant Salmonella which harboured 

mobile genetic elements. Class 1 integrons situated on transferable plasmids may contribute to the 

dissemination  of  antibiotic  resistance  among  Salmonella.  Our  findings  highlight  the  need  for 

stringent  sanitation  and  hygienic  standards  in  fresh  food  markets  to  reduce  the  occurrence 

of Salmonella as well as the cautious use of antibiotics in poultry production to limit the emergence 

of antibiotic resistance in foodborne zoonotic bacterial pathogens.

The overall prevalence of Salmonella spp. was 29.1% (187/642) for all samples.

A total of 187 Salmonella isolates belonging to 37 different serovars were isolated.

Approximately 55% of the Salmonella spp. isolates were multidrug resistant.

Eleven different resistance genes were detected in antibiotic resistant isolates.

Class 1 integrons with variable gene cassettes were detected.
