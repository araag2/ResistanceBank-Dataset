1. Introduction

Meat and meat products have been implicated in outbreaks of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in most parts of
the world. In the Amathole District Municipality of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, a large
number of households consume meat and meat products daily, although the microbiological quality of
these types of food is questionable. The present study investigated the prevalence of E. coli O157:H7
isolated from selected meat and meat products (45 samples each of biltong, cold meat, mincemeat, and
polony) sold in this area. Strains of E. coli O157:H7 were isolated by enrichment culture and conÔ¨Årmed by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Also investigated were the antibiogram proÔ¨Åles of the E. coli O157:H7
isolates. Five (2.8%) out of 180 meat and meat products examined were positive for E. coli O157:H7 that
carried the Ô¨ÇiCH7, rfbEO157, and eaeA genes. Two of the E. coli O157:H7 isolates were resistant against all
the eight antibiotics tested. To prevent E. coli O157:H7 infections, meat and meat products such as
biltong, cold meat, mincemeat and polony should be properly handled, and packed in sterile polyvinyl
wrappers.

Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a human pathogen worldwide asso-
ciated with meat and meat products, dairy products, vegetables,
and water (Browning et al., 1990; Galane and Le Roux, 2001; Obi
et al., 2004; Magwira et al., 2005). It is recognized as a bacterium
causing hemorrhagic colitis (Olorunshola et al., 2000; Galane and
Le Roux, 2001). Diarrheal diseases linked to E. coli O157:H7 infec-
tions are characterized by blood, cramping abdominal pain, fever,
nausea, and vomiting (Calundungo et al., 1994; Germani et al., 1997;
Yoh et al., 1996; Olorunshola et al., 2000; Koyange et al., 2004).
African people living in countries such as Central African Republic,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Kenya, Nigeria, Swaziland
and Cameroon, CoÀÜte d‚ÄôIvoire, Malawi and others have suffered from
diarrhea caused by E. coli O157:H7 (Germani et al., 1997, 1998;
Paquet et al., 1993; Isaacson et al., 1993). The Ô¨Årst case of E. coli
O157:H7 infection in South Africa was in 1990 (Browning et al.,
1990). Since then, several sporadic cases of bloody diarrhea and
also an outbreak have been reported in South Africa (EfÔ¨Çer et al.,

2001, Galane and Le Roux, 2001). Research done on water distri-
bution systems in the rural parts of South Africa has revealed
worrying levels of water contaminated by E. coli (Mu¬® ller et al., 2001,
2003), although E. coli O157:h7 was not isolated from the waters
that were investigated.

Even though several studies have demonstrated that healthy
ruminant animals such as sheep, goats, and deer harbor E. coli
O157:H7 (Kudva et al., 1996; Pritchard et al., 2000; Fischer et al.,
2001), the distribution of E. coli O157:H7 in cattle is ubiquitous
(Meyer-Broseta et al., 2001; Grauke et al., 2002). In South Africa,
approximately 56% of goat meat is sourced from the Eastern Cape.
The province also produces 12 000 tons of beef, 8000 tons of
mutton and 76 000 tons of pork every year (South African
Government Information, 2000). Although the animals from which
the meat and meat products are sourced have been reported to
carry E. coli O157:H7, there have not been any reported cases of
food-borne outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the Eastern Cape Prov-
ince; this could be related to lack of surveillance and poor
reporting.

By the year 2002, a large proportion of the Eastern Cape pop-
ulation (68%) still lived below the South African national poverty
line (UNDP, 2004) and approximately 11% and 38% of the pop-
ulation lived in informal and traditional structures, respectively.
People continue with unsafe hygienic practices, such as unsafe
human excreta disposal, unsafe solid and liquid waste disposal and

174

unsafe drinking water (Phaswana-Mafuya and Shukla, 2005).
There are also cultural practices that encourage communal eating
for instance during funerals, weddings, political rallies and
circumcision ceremonies. The aforementioned unsafe practices are
possible breeding avenues for pathogenic microorganisms such as
E. coli O157:H7. When these bacteria contaminate meat and meat
products, they may Ô¨Ånally infect humans. Infections commonly
associated with consumption of meat and meat products
contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 can easily spread throughout
the entire community, leaving behind a trail of destruction of lives
mostly to people with reduced immune systems such as HIV/AIDS
patients.

One of the major problems that accompany E. coli O157:H7
infection is the danger of treating such patients with antibiotics
(Wong et al., 2000; Okoli et al., 2005). Wong et al. (2005) warn that
treating E. coli O157:H7 infections may result in the release of
shigatoxins into the blood stream of the infected individuals. It is
believed that the release of such toxins affects the kidneys resulting
in a condition described as hemolytic uremic syndrome (Wong
et al., 2000). This therefore presents a great challenge in the
treatment approach to be adopted in the case of E. coli O157:H7
infections. In the present study, the prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in
selected meat and meat products often consumed in the Province
has been determined as well as the molecular characteristics and
antibiogram proÔ¨Åles of the E. coli O157:H7 isolates.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Study areas and sample collection

One hundred and eighty samples of meat and meat products
(45 samples of biltong, cold meat, mincemeat, and polony) were
used in the study. The meat and meat products were purchased
from butcheries, shops, supermarkets, and open air markets
serving the communities of Alice, Fort Beaufort, and Mdantsane
from March 2005 to August 2006. Biltong is a South African
product typically made from raw Ô¨Ållets of meat cut into strips
following the grain of the muscle and dried. It is similar to beef
jerky in that both are spiced dried meats but they differ signiÔ¨Å-
cantly in typical ingredients, taste, and production process. The
word biltong is from the Dutch word ‚Äò‚Äòbil‚Äô‚Äô meaning rump and
‚Äò‚Äòtong‚Äô‚Äô meaning strip or tongue (Stephanie, 2006). The samples
were placed in sterile polyvinyl bags, put in a cooler box with ice
blocks, and transported to the laboratory where the microbiolog-
ical examination started within 24 h after collection of
the
samples.

2.2. Culture-based enrichment, recovery, and identiÔ¨Åcation of
E. coli O157:H7

2.2.1. Enrichment and recovery of E. coli O157:H7

For enrichment, 10 g of each meat and meat product samples
were added to 90 ml of modiÔ¨Åed EC (mEC) broth containing
novobiocin (n) (Merck, SA, 20 mg ml 1) (Cagney et al., 2004). The
samples were incubated for 8 h at 37 C on a rotary shaker with
centrifugation at 100 rpm (Gallenkamp, Loughborough, UK). One
milliliter of each enriched sample culture was then added to an
Eppendorf tube (Eppendorf, SA) containing 20 ml of magnetic beads
coated with antibodies to E. coli O157 (Dynal, Oslo Norway).
Immunomagnetic separation (IMS) was carried out as described by
the manufacturer (Dynal Product Brochure, 2006). Finally, the
beads were re-suspended in 1 ml of sterile 1% (w/v) phosphate-
buffered water (Merck, SA) and the suspension was spread in
duplicate (50 ml each) onto sorbitol‚ÄìMacConkey agar supple-
mented with ceÔ¨Åxime (0.05 mg l 1) and potassium tellurite (2.5 mg
l 1) (CT-SMAC) (Merck, SA) (Cagney et al., 2004). Five typical

sorbitol-non-fermenting colonies were selected, sub-cultured onto
Nutrient Agar (NA) (Merck, SA), and subjected to a conÔ¨Årmatory
test as described below.

Prior to the conventional indole‚Äìmethyl red‚ÄìVoges-Proskauer
citrate (IMViC) tests, Gram-negative colonies were tested for
oxidase activity (Mu¬® ller et al., 2003; Feng and Monday, 2000). Then
biochemical characterization using an API 20E kit (bioMerieux) was
performed following the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. The strips
were read and Ô¨Ånal identiÔ¨Åcation was secured using API LAB PLUS
computer software (bioMe¬¥ rieux) (Momba et al., 2006).

2.3. Molecular characterization of E. coli O157:H7 using the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

2.3.1. Bacterial DNA extraction

DNA was extracted from sorbitol non-fermenting colonies
identiÔ¨Åed as E. coli and from a positive control strain for E. coli
O157:H7 (ATCC 43895) following the method of Torres et al. (2003).
A loop-full of overnight culture of presumptive E. coli O157:H7
colonies was suspended in 200 ml of sterile Milli-Q PCR grade water
(Merck, SA) and the cells were lysed using a Dri-Block DB.2A
(Merck, SA) for 15 min at 100 C. The cell debris was removed by
centrifugation at 13 400 rpm for 2 min using a MiniSpin micro-
centrifuge (Merck, SA). The lysate supernatant was placed on ice
for 5 min.

2.3.2. AmpliÔ¨Åcation of Ô¨ÇiCH7, rfbEO157 and eaeA genes

Three sets of oligonucleotide primer mixtures were prepared
according to the method previously used by Wang et al. (2002). A
total volume of 10 ml of the extracted DNA was used in each PCR
reaction. The PCR assays for Ô¨ÇiCH7, rfbEO157 and eaeA (A/E) genes
were carried out in a 50 ml reaction volume containing 10
SuperTherm GOLD buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, each of the four deoxy-
nucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) (Southern Cross Biotechnology,
SA) at a concentration of 0.25 mM, 100 pmol each of Ô¨ÇiCH7, rfbEO157
and eaeA speciÔ¨Åc primers, 5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Southern
Cross Biotechnology). The reaction was carried out in the Eppen-
dorf model AG 22331 Thermocycler (Merck, SA). The PCR condi-
tions adopted in this study were similar to those previously used
by Wang et al. (2002). Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ATCC 43895
strain) and sterile Milli-Q PCR grade water (Merck, SA) were
included in each PCR assay as positive and negative controls
respectively.

2.3.3. DNA electrophoresis

The amplicons (10 ml aliquots) were resolved in a 2% (w/v)
agarose gel (Merck, SA) in 1 TAE buffer (40 mM Tris‚ÄìHCl, 20 mM
Na-acetate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.5) and stained with 0.5 mg ml 1
ethidium bromide (EtBr) (Merck, SA) (Wang et al., 2002; Cagney
et al., 2004) before being visualized and photographed under the
BioDoc-It System (UVP Upland, CA 91786, USA). A 100-bp DNA
ladder (Promega, USA) was included on each gel as a molecular size
standard. The electrophoresis was carried out at 76 V for 1 h.

2.3.4. Anti-microbial susceptibility test

The anti-microbial susceptibility test was determined using the
Bauer and Kirby disk diffusion technique on Mueller‚ÄìHinton Agar
(Merck, SA) (Jorgensen et al., 1999) using the antibiotics listed in
Table 1. To achieve the antibiotic susceptibility of E. coli O157:H7 the
measurement for the zones of inhibition was based on the break-
points of the zone diameters for individual antibiotic agents. The
results were interpreted according to the guidelines of the National
Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards for anti-microbial
susceptibility testing (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory
Standards, 1999). Escherichia coli (ATCC 43895) strain was included
as a positive control.

3.1. Prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in meat and meat products

The prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 is based on the number of
meat and meat products that were positive for E. coli O157:H7,
which carried the three target genes (Ô¨ÇiCH7, rfbEO157, and eaeA)
detected in the isolates by PCR analysis. The results show that Ô¨Åve
out of the 180 meat and meat product samples that were tested
were positive for E. coli O157:H7 as veriÔ¨Åed by PCR for rfbEO157 and
Ô¨ÇiCH7. All isolates were positive for eaeA. These Ô¨Åve meat and meat
products were made up of two polony samples (one from Fort
Beaufort and another from Mdantsane), one mincemeat and a cold
meat sample (from Mdantsane), and a biltong sample from Alice.

3.2. Drug susceptibility testing

The results of the antibiotic susceptibility testing are summa-

rized in Table 1.

4. Discussion

The study showed that Ô¨Åve (2.8%) of the 180 samples of meat
and meat products from Alice, Fort Beaufort, and Mdantsane were
contaminated with E. coli O157:H7. These E. coli were found to be
positive for the three target genes Ô¨ÇiCH7, rfbEO157 and eaeA genes
that are characteristics of E. coli O157:H7. A previous study carried
out in Pretoria/South Africa revealed much higher levels (74.5%) of
E. coli in meat and meat products (Vorster et al., 1994), however, the
authors did not investigate for E. coli O157:H7. Nevertheless, the
results of the current study conÔ¨Årm the most recent Ô¨Åndings of
similar research conducted in one African State (Magwira et al.,
2005). In Botswana, Magwira et al. (2005) isolated E. coli O157:H7
from 5.22% of chunk meat, 3.76% of mincemeat, and 2.26% of
sausages. In France, Vernozy-Rozand et al. (2002) also isolated the
bacterium from 0.12% of industrial mincemeat. In Switzerland E. coli
O157:H7 was isolated from 2.3% of mincemeat investigated (Chinen
et al., 2001). The Ô¨Åndings of the current study report a very low
prevalence (0.03%) of E. coli O157:H7 in meat and meat products
consumed within the Amathole District. These Ô¨Åndings corroborate
those of Vernozy-Rozand et al. (2002) since both fall within
a similar percentage range. However, it must be noted that the
presence of these pathogens in foods meant for human consump-
tion is of great concern owing to the very low infectivity dose
(10‚Äì100 cells) of E. coli O157:H7 (Hawker et al., 2001).

The most probable reason for the high prevalence of E. coli
O157:H7 in mincemeat may be due to the spread of these bacteria
during the mincing process. It is also suspected that mixing of meat
from several cows, when only one carcass is fecally contaminated
with E. coli O157 may result in contamination of the whole batch of
minced meat. Further cross-contamination of the minced meat

may be acquired from the mincing blades. E. coli O157:H7 may also
be harbored in raw beef that is used in the manufacture of other
meat products (Flores and Stewart, 2004).

Recent studies have revealed a trend towards increased antibi-
otic resistance of E. coli O157:H7 (Amornrut et al., 2000; Magwira
et al., 2005). For instance, in 2005, about 35% of E. coli O157:H7
strains isolated from meat and meat products in Gaborone,
Botswana, were resistant to cephalothin, sulfatriad, colistin sulfate
and tetracycline (Magwira et al., 2005).

In this study, E. coli O157:H7 isolates were resistant to 5 out of 8
antibiotics namely: gentamicin, ampicillin, nalidixic acid, erythro-
mycin, and tetracycline. There was double and multiple resistances
(R) of four isolates. However, some isolates were either interme-
diately susceptible (I) and/or fully susceptible (S) to some antibi-
otics (Table 1).

Antibiotic resistance may occur either spontaneously by selec-
tive pressure or because of antibiotic miss-use by humans or over-
use by farmers on their beef cattle (Schroeder et al., 2002).
Although antibiotic resistance is common, antibiotics are still
indicated in the management of life threatening diseases like
diarrhea. However, the use of antibiotics in the management of E.
coli O157:H7 infections in humans is still controversial due to the
possible development of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) (Wong
et al., 2000).

Noteworthy is the fact that even though cold meat and polony
are always packed in polyvinyl wrappers, the samples that were
used in this study were purchased from butcheries while unpacked
and sliced in small quantities hence this could have exposed them
to contamination by E. coli O157:H7.
In addition, the biltong
samples that were used in this study were displayed hanging from
hooks attached to the ceiling of butchery buildings and this may be
a factor for cross-contamination of such meat products by Ô¨Çies and
cockroaches feeding on the meat.

Mincemeat could have been contaminated with E. coli O157:H7
during the mincing process. Meat needs to be washed and cooked
thoroughly to prevent human infection as proper cooking at very
high temperatures actually destroys the cells of E. coli O157:H7.
Meat products need to be handled while observing great hygiene
and safety. During the study, improper handling of meat and meat
products in the shops and butcheries was observed. Such uncon-
trolled handling of meat and meat products might lead to their
cross-contamination with E. coli O157:H7.

5. Conclusion and recommendation

The results of the present study indicated a low prevalence of E.
coli O157:H7 in meat and meat products sold in Amathole District
Municipality. Only 5 (2.8%) out of 180 meat and meat products
examined were positive for E. coli O157:H7 that carried the Ô¨ÇiCH7,
rfbEO157, and eaeA genes. The low prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in
meat and meat products should not be underestimated as this
bacterium has been implicated in disease outbreaks worldwide.
Frequent surveillance for E. coli O157:H7 in meat and meat products
sold in the Amathole District and South Africa as a whole is
therefore recommended in order to ascertain the exact prevalence
level of the bacterium. The study also revealed that 2 of the E. coli
O157:H7 isolates were resistant against all the eight antibiotics
tested. Regardless of the effects of some antibiotics against the E.
coli O157:H7 isolates, treating of patients infected with bacteria is
still a subject of discussion in the scientiÔ¨Åc fraternity and is
therefore beyond the scope of the current study.
