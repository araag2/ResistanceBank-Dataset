The multi-resistance gene cfr is widely distributed among various gram-positive and
gram-negative species in livestock in China. To better understand the epidemiology
of cfr among Staphylococcus spp. and E. coli
isolates, 254 Staphylococcus spp.
and 398 E. coli strains collected from six swine farms in China were subjected to
prevalence and genetic analysis. Forty (15.7%) Staphylococcus spp. isolates, including
38 Staphylococcus sciuri strains, one Staphylococcus chromogenes strain, and one
Staphylococcus lentus strain, and two (0.5%) E. coli
isolates were found to contain
the cfr gene. Most of the 38 S. sciuri strains were clonally unrelated; however, clonal
dissemination of cfr-positive S. sciuri was detected at the same farm. In eight randomly
selected cfr-positive staphylococci, a cfr-harboring module (IS21-558-cfr-tnpB) was
detected in six S. sciuri isolates; cfr was bracketed by two copies of ISEnfa4 or IS256
in the remaining two S. sciuri
isolates, EP25 and EP28, cfr
was ﬂanked by two IS26 elements in the same or opposite orientation, respectively.
Complete sequence analysis of the novel F43:A-:B- plasmid pHNEP28 revealed that it
contains two multi-resistance regions: cfr together with ﬂoR, qnrS1 interspersed with
IS26, (cid:77)ISCR2 and ISKpn19, and blaTEM−1 together with tet(M) interspersed with IS26,
ISApl1, (cid:77)Tn2, and (cid:77)IS1B. The coexistence of cfr with other resistance genes on a
conjugative plasmid may contribute to the dissemination of these genes by co-selection.
Thus, rational drug use and continued surveillance of cfr in swine farms are warranted.

INTRODUCTION

The multi-resistance gene cfr encodes a methyltransferase that modiﬁes position A2503 at 23S
rRNA and confers resistance to six diﬀerent classes of antibiotics that bind to the peptidyl
transferase center (Kehrenberg et al., 2005; Giessing et al., 2009). Cfr confers resistance to
phenicols, lincosamides, oxazolidinones, pleuromutilins, and streptogramin A antibiotics (the
PhLOPSA phenotype) and reduces susceptibility to the 16-membered macrolides josamysin

cfr in Staphylococci and Escherichia coli from Pigs

and spiramycin (Long et al., 2006), which are used extensively
in the treatment of infections in both humans and animals.
Oxazolidinones, in particular, are regarded as the last defense
against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or
vancomycin-resistant enterococci in humans (Toh et al., 2007).
The cfr gene was ﬁrst identiﬁed in a bovine Staphylococcus sciuri
isolate (Stefan et al., 2000) and subsequently in staphylococcal
isolates of human and animal origin from around the world
(Shen et al., 2013). In addition, various Enterococcus, Bacillus,
Macrococcus, Jeotgalicoccus, Streptococcus suis, Proteus vulgaris,
and Escherichia coli strains have also been reported to be
cfr-positive (Shen et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013b). The cfr gene
is not only widely disseminated in staphylococci from pigs in
China (Shen et al., 2013), but also increasingly reported in porcine
E. coli isolates in China. To date, a total of 16 cfr-positive E. coli
isolates have been identiﬁed in the Shandong, Sichuan, Guangxi,
and Guangdong provinces, China (Deng et al., 2014; Wang et al.,
2012a; Zhang et al., 2014; Zhang R. et al., 2015; Zhang W.J.
et al., 2015), suggesting the possibility of the transfer of cfr
from Staphylococcus to E. coli. In this study, we identiﬁed cfr-
positive Staphylococcus spp. and E. coli isolates from the same
farm and determined the complete nucleotide sequence of a novel
conjugative F43:A-:B- plasmid bearing cfr in an E. coli isolate.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sampling and Bacterial Isolates
A total of 323 pig nasal swab samples and 442 fecal samples
were collected in 2013 from six swine farms located in four
geographically distinct provinces in China: one farm in Jilin
(DBNA), two farms in Guangdong (GDEP and GDYD), one farm
in Jiangxi (JXTC), and two farms in Henan (HNYM and HNYC).
The usage of antibiotic agents at these farms over the past year
(except farm DBNA) was supplied by their veterinarians. All
animal studies were performed with the approval of the Animal
Care and Use Committee of South China Agriculture University.
Nasal swab samples were incubated in 7.5% Sodium Chloride
Broth for 16–18 h at 37◦C and then streaked onto Mannitol Salt
agar plates and grown for 16–18 h at 37◦C. Next, one presumptive
staphylococcal isolate per sample was randomly selected for
further analysis. Fecal samples were used to isolate E. coli as
previously described (Chen et al., 2007). Species identiﬁcation of
all cfr-positive strains was determined by the ID32 STAPH system
(bioMérieux, Craponne, France) and was further conﬁrmed by
sequencing the 16S rRNA using universal prokaryotic primers
(Weisburg et al., 1991).

Identiﬁcation of Resistance Genes and
the Genetic Environment of cfr
All Staphylococcus spp. and E. coli isolates were screened for
the presence of cfr by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as
previously described (Kehrenberg and Schwarz, 2006). The cfr-
positive staphylococci were also PCR-screened for the presence
of the fexA, fexB, mecA, and mecC genes (Murakami et al., 1991;
Kehrenberg and Schwarz, 2006; Liu et al., 2012; Paterson et al.,

2012). Additionally, the cfr-positive E. coli strains were screened
for ﬂoR (Chen et al., 2004).

The genetic context surrounding cfr was examined by PCR
mapping and sequencing in eight randomly selected cfr-positive
Staphylococcus spp. and two cfr-positive E. coli isolates. The
primers used to determine the regions upstream and downstream
of cfr are listed in Supplementary Table S1.

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing
All cfr-positive Staphylococcus spp. and E. coli isolates were
tested for their antimicrobial susceptibility using the agar dilution
method. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were conducted and
evaluated according to the recommendations speciﬁed in CLSI
documents VET01-S2 (CLSI, 2013) and M100-S25 (CLSI,
2015). Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ≥16 mg/L
were tentatively considered as criteria of ﬂorfenicol resistance
(Kehrenberg and Schwarz, 2006). S. aureus ATCC R(cid:13)29213 and
E. coli ATCC R(cid:13)25922 served as quality control strains.

Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST)
Seven housekeeping genes, including adk, fumC, gyrB, icd, mdh,
purA, and recA, were used to determine the sequence types (STs)
of all the cfr-positive E. coli (Lau et al., 2008). The MLST databases
were used for BLAST analysis1.

Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE)
Pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to determine
the clonality of the cfr-positive S. sciuri isolates. Whole-cells were
packed with an equal volume of 2% (wt/vol) low melting point
agarose (Bio-Rad, Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) dissolved
in EC buﬀer (Liu et al., 2014) and poured into plug molds.
The frozen plugs were addressed according to the previously
described with minor modiﬁcation. The digested fragments
were separated using a CHEF-DRIII system (Bio-Rad) with a
clamped homogeneous electric ﬁeld of 6 V/cm, using a 120◦
switch angle for 24 h at 14◦C, with the pulse time linearly
ramped from 3 to 40 s. PFGE was performed for all cfr-positive
E. coli
isolates using the CHEF Mapper System (Bio-Rad),
according to a previously described protocol (Chen et al.,
2007). Comparison of PFGE patterns was performed using
the BioNumerics software (Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem,
Belgium) using the Dice coeﬃcient (1.5% optimization and 1.0%
tolerance); a similarity cutoﬀ of 80% was used to identify a PFGE
cluster.

S1-PFGE, Conjugation/Transformation,
and Replicon Type of cfr-Carrying
Plasmids from E. coli

S1 nuclease pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (S1-PFGE) combined
with Southern blotting was performed to determine the location
of cfr in E. coli and the size of the plasmid according to
previous protocol with minor modiﬁcations (Barton et al., 1995).

cfr in Staphylococci and Escherichia coli from Pigs

Conjugation experiments were conducted using E. coli C600
(streptomycin resistant) as the recipient. Transconjugants were
selected on MacConkey agar containing 3000 mg/L streptomycin
and 10 mg/L ﬂorfenicol. Plasmid DNA was extracted from
cfr-carrying E. coli strains and transformed into E. coli recipient
strain DH5α (Takara) using the calcium chloride method when
the cfr-carrying plasmid could not be transferred to E. coli
C600 via conjugation. Transformants were selected on Luria-
Bertani agar plates containing 10 mg/L ﬂorfenicol. The replicon
types of cfr-carrying plasmids were determined by PCR-based
replicon typing (PBRT), as previously described (Carattoli et al.,
2005). Replicon sequence typing (RST) was performed to further
characterize the IncFII plasmid (Villa et al., 2010).

Sequencing of Plasmid pHNEP28
Plasmid pHNEP28 from porcine E. coli
isolate EP28 was
puriﬁed from a transconjugant using a Qiagen plasmid midi
kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and 3 µg DNA was quantiﬁed
by NanoDropTM 2000/2000c Spectrophotometers from Thermo
Scientiﬁc. Sequence was performed by the Roche 454 GS-FLX
system. Contigs were assembled with the 454 GS de novo
assembler (Newbler) v2.8. Gaps between contigs were closed by
PCR and sequencing. Annotation of pHNEP28 was performed
using the RAST server (Aziz et al., 2008), ISﬁnder2, and BLAST3.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical signiﬁcance for the comparison of prevalence data was
determined by the x2-test. p-values less than 0.05 were regarded
as statistically signiﬁcant.

Nucleotide Sequence Accession Number
The nucleotide sequence of the plasmid pHNEP28 has been
deposited with the GenBank nucleotide sequence database under
accession number KT845955.

RESULTS

Detection of cfr and Antimicrobial
Susceptibility of cfr-Positive Isolates
Two-hundred and ﬁfty four Staphylococcus spp. strains and
398 E. coli strains were recovered from the 323 nasal swab
and 442 fecal samples, respectively (Table 1). Among them,
cfr was detected in 40 (15.7%) Staphylococcus
spp. and
two (0.5%) E. coli
isolates. Farm GDEP in the Guangdong
province showed the highest prevalence of cfr-positive (37.5%)
Staphylococcus spp. strains and it was also the only farm
with cfr-positive E. coli strains (Table 1). The predominant
cfr-positive Staphylococcus spp. species was S. sciuri (n = 38);
additionally, one S. chromogenes isolate was obtained from
farm HNYC and one S.
lentus isolate was found at farm
GDYD.

cfr in Staphylococci and Escherichia coli from Pigs

Antimicrobial Resistance and Resistance
Determinants
Antimicrobial susceptibility assays showed that all 40 cfr-positive
Staphylococcus spp. isolates exhibited resistance to erythromycin,
tetracycline, clindamycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
In addition, 39 (97.5%), 37 (92.5%), 36 (90%), 36 (90%), and
34 (85%) cfr-positive Staphylococcus spp. isolates demonstrated
resistance to oxacillin, tiamulin, valnemulin, ﬂorfenicol, and
gentamicin, respectively. Of the 40 cfr-positive staphylococci,
19 (47.5%) and 11 (27.5%) were resistant
to ciproﬂoxacin
and rifamycin, while only three (7.5%) isolates were linezolid-
resistant (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S2). The two cfr-
positive E. coli strains also exhibited a multiresistance phenotype,
namely, ampicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, ﬂorfenicol, and
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance. Strain EP28 was also
ciproﬂoxacin-resistant (Table 3).

Of the 40 cfr-positive staphylococcal isolates, 25 strains carried
fexA, while fexB was not detected. Interestingly, 32 of the
39 oxacillin-resistant staphylococci harbored mecA; mecC was
not detected in the remaining seven mecA-negative strains. In
addition, mecA,
fexA, and cfr coexisted in 22 staphylococci
(Table 2). The cfr-positive E. coli strain EP28 also carried ﬂoR
(Table 3).

Molecular Typing
The 38 cfr-positive S. sciuri strains were analyzed by PFGE and 28
major SmaI patterns were observed, whereas seven strains were
nontypeable by PFGE using SmaI (Table 2 and Supplementary
Figure S1). Although obtained from the same farm, the two cfr-
carrying E. coli isolates were not related (Table 3). The cfr-positive
E. coli strain EP25 was shown to belong to ST1602, whereas E. coli
EP28 represented a novel ST, ST4241 (Table 3). Interestingly, ﬁve
cfr-positive S. sciuri strains isolated from the same farm located in
the Jiangxi province were grouped in two clusters (Dice similarity
index was ≥80%): strains with similar PFGE patterns A1, A2, and
A3, and two strains showing related PFGE patterns B1 and B2.

Genetic Environment of cfr
The regions surrounding cfr were determined by PCR mapping
and sequencing in eight randomly selected Staphylococcus strains.
In six isolates, IS21-558 was identiﬁed 99% identity with
upstream of cfr and truncated transposase gene tnpB was found
downstream of cfr (Table 2). This arrangement (IS21-558-cfr-
tnpB) is identical 99% identity to the corresponding region of
plasmids pSS-02 (accession no. JF834910, S. saprophyticus, swine,
China), pHNTLD18 (accession no. KF751702, S. equorum, pork,
China), pSA737 (accession no. KC206006, S. aureus, patient,
USA), pHK01 (accession no. KC820816, S. cohnii, patient,
China), and pHNCR35 (accession no. KF861983, S. simulans, hog
market worker, China) (Wang et al., 2015).

In S. sciuri strain GDEP27, cfr was bracketed by two copies of
ISEnfa4 in the same orientation, which was identical 98% identity
to the corresponding region of E. faecalis pW9-2 (accession no.
JQ911741, sewage at pig farm, China) and pHOU-cfr (accession
no. JQ660368, patient, Thailand), E. thailandicus pW3 (accession

no. JQ911739, sewage at pig farm, China), and p3-38 (accession
no. JQ911740, pig, China).

In S. sciuri strain JXTC28, cfr is bracketed by two copies
of IS256 in the same orientation, a partial fragment of IS1216
and the aminoglycoside resistance gene aacA-aphD were located
downstream of IS256. This IS1216-aacA-aphD-IS256-cfr-IS256
module was 98% identity to that found on plasmid pSS-04
(accession no. KF129410) carried by porcine S. sciuri GN5-1 in
Sichuan province, China.

In both cfr-positive E. coli strains, the cfr gene was ﬂanked by
two copies of IS26 (Supplementary Figure S2). Strain EP25 had
a similar genetic environment to plasmids pEC-01 (accession no.
JN982327) identiﬁed in a porcine E. coli strain from the Shandong
province, China, and pSD7 (accession no. KJ453116) found in a
porcine E. coli isolate from the Guangdong province, China; 2
copies of IS26 located in the same orientation, but opposite to
cfr gene (Supplementary Figure S2B). In EP28, the 2 copies of
IS26 are in opposite orientation relative to one another, with cfr in
the same orientation than IS26 right-copy (Supplementary Figure
S2A).

Transformation of Plasmids Carrying cfr
into E. coli
the cfr gene
S1-PFGE and Southern blotting showed that
in isolates EP25 and EP28 were located on a plasmid of
approximately 95 and 105 kb, respectively. The cfr-carrying
plasmids from isolate EP28 and EP25, designated as pHNEP28
and pHNEP25, were successfully transferred to E. coli C600
and DH5α, respectively. Plasmid pHNEP28 was identiﬁed as
F43:A-:B-, while the replicon type of pHNEP25 could not be
determined using the PBRT method. Both the transconjugant
EP28-2J and the transformant EP25-1Z exhibited resistance
against ampicillin, ﬂorfenicol, and elevated MICs of cefotaxime
and ciproﬂoxacin, compared with the recipient E. coli strain
(C600 or DH5α; Table 3). In addition, EP25-1Z also showed
resistance to tetracycline, streptomycin, and sulfamethoxazole-
trimethoprim, whereas the acquisition of pHNEP28 increased
tetracycline MIC by only onefold.

Characterization of pHNEP28 from E. coli
Strain EP28
Sequence analysis revealed that pHNEP28 is 108,837 bp in size
with an average GC content of 49.85% (contigN50: 108837 bp).
Plasmid pHNEP28 consisted a typical IncFII-type backbone
(83,398 bp) encoding plasmid replication, horizontal transfer,
maintenance and stability functions, and two multi-resistance
regions (MRR) (Figure 1).

The replication region (position 36,852–38,269 bp), consisting
of repA2 and repA1, was classiﬁed as F43:A-:B:- by RST. This
region shared 97% identity to two F2:A-:B- NDM-producing
plasmids from E. coli
isolates: pMC-NDM (accession no.
HG003695) and pGUE-NDM (accession no. JQ364967). The
transfer-leading region comprised genes related to plasmid
maintenance and stability, including parA, parB, and ssb, as well
as many putative genes. Additionally, genes involved in induced
mutagenesis and DNA damage tolerance (umuC and umuD) and

were also identiﬁed. A section of the plasmid transfer-leading
region (position 4,906–15,340 bp) shared 99% nucleotide identity
with Enterobacter cloacae plasmid pIMP-HB623 (accession
no. KM877517). Another section (position 77,101–88,852 bp)
showed 97% identity to enteropathogenic E. coli plasmid p026_2
(accession no. AP010955).

The transfer region of pHNEP28 included 24 tra genes
and ﬁnO and is less highly related to other IncFII plasmids,

with ∼94%-97% identity to this region in E. coli plasmid
pEB3 (accession no. CP006001) from Vietnam, which was
designed to F30:A-:B:- by RST. Furthermore, the partial tra
region of pHNEP28 (position 69475-77025 bp) showed high
homology (98% nucleotide identity) with plasmids pMC-NDM
and pGUE-NDM.

The pHNEP28 contained two mosaic MRR regions (Figure 2).
The ﬁrst 9,677 bp MRR, located downstream of the replication
region, contains two resistance genes (tet(M) and blaTEM−1)

and complete or truncated insertion sequences and transposons
(IS1B, intI4, Tn2, ISAplI, and IS26). The tet(M) gene found
in pHNEP28 shared 96–98% nucleotide identity with sequences
in S. pneumoniae strain 11930 (accession no. FR671416),
Tn916-like transposon Tn6085 from E. faecium (accession no.
HM243623), Tn916/Tn1545-like transposon from E.
faecalis
(accession no. DQ223241), and S. aureus strain TW20 (accession
no. NG_048252); whereas it was identical to the tet(M) gene from
porcine E. coli isolate CICYT-332 (accession no. KJ755873) found
in Spain, although only 1802/1935 bps of CICYT-332 tet(M)
were sequenced. While tet(M) demonstrated only 96% identity
to that in plasmid pTCY4 (KJ772289, duck E. coli, China),
the 1,204-bp module (IS26-orf12-orf13) upstream of tet(M) was
identical to the corresponding region of pTCY4. Transposon Tn2
carrying resistance gene blaTEM−1 was interrupted by ISApl1,
which generated 2-bp direct repeats (DR) (5(cid:48)-CT-3(cid:48)); tnpR of Tn2
was truncated by IS26, which interrupted another Tn2 with an
opposite orientation (Figure 2A).

including

Another MRR module

the
multiresistance gene cfr, ﬂorfenicol eﬄux pump gene ﬂoR,
and quinolone resistance gene qnrS1, was inserted into the
plasmid stability region. As shown in Figure 2B, the cfr gene
was ﬂanked by two IS26 located in the opposite orientation,
in agreement with the result obtained by PCR mapping. In
addition, the 2,513-bp module (rep-IS26) was identical to
the corresponding region in plasmids pHNFP671 (accession
no. KP324830), pSD6 (accession no. KJ453115), and pFSEC-01
(accession no. KR779901) from porcine E. coli in China. In
plasmid pHNEP28, the rep-IS26 region was found in the
opposite orientation with a second copy of IS26 present in
the downstream region. Furthermore, another IS26 element is
present downstream of cfr on plasmids pHNFP671 and pSD6,
though the 2,414-bp segment containing cfr and IS26 was
identical to plasmid pHNEP28 in our study (Figure 2B).

Moreover, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance gene qnrS1
was ﬂanked by two copies of ISKpn19 located in the opposite

orientation, although the ﬁrst one was interrupted by IS26
(Figure 2B). The 4615-bp module (qnrS1-ISKpn19) was present
in multiple plasmids, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae plasmids
pNDM-1fa (CP014757, human, USA) and pK1HV (HF545434,
human, Vietnam), and E. coli plasmids pPGRT46 (KM023153,
human, Nigeria), pEQ2 (KF362122, equine, Czech Republic),
and pKT58A (JX065631, water fowl, Slovakia) (Dolejska et al.,
2013). The IS26-ISKpn19-qnrS1 module was identical 99% to
that in E. coli isolate E80 (KF921555, raw wastewater, Portugal),
containing a disrupted qnrS1 gene (Figure 2B). The 4,292-bp
segment (virD2-ﬂoR-ISCR2) was identical 99% identity to
the corresponding region of plasmids pHNSHP45-2 (KU34138,
porcine E.
coli, China), pHXY0908 (KM877269, chicken
Salmonella Typhimurium, China), and pK1HV (HF545434,
human K. pneumoniae, Vietnam); however, both virD2 and
ISCR2 were truncated by IS26 in plasmid pHNEP28 (Figure 2B).

DISCUSSION

that

In this study, cfr was identiﬁed in 15.7 and 0.5% of Staphylococcus
spp. and E. coli isolates from pigs, respectively. The prevalence
of cfr among E. coli strains was still low, which is in agreement
with a previous report (Deng et al., 2014). However, to the
best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of cfr being
found in Staphylococcus spp. and E. coli strains at the same
farm. The presence of cfr-positive E. coli at farm GDEP may
not be surprising given the high prevalence of cfr-positive
farm. The prevalence of cfr-positive
staphylococci at
staphylococci from farms GDEP (37.5%) and GDYD (35.5%)
in the Guangdong province and from farm JXTC (25.5%) in
the Jiangxi province was signiﬁcantly higher than that in strains
from farms HNYM (0%) and HNYC (5.8%) located in the
Henan province (p < 0.5). According to drug usage records,
ﬂorfenicol is used prophylactically or for treatment of bacterial
diseases at farms GDEP, GDYD, and JXTC, but not at farms
HNYM and HNYC (Table 1), which may account for the
diﬀerent detection rates. The direct selective pressure imposed
by ﬂorfenicol appears to be the main driving force promoting
the dissemination of cfr among same or diﬀerent species at the
same farm. This hypothesis is further supported by the presence
of the ﬂorfenicol eﬄux gene ﬂoR in one cfr-positive E. coli
isolate and the ﬂorfenicol eﬄux gene fexA in 25 cfr-carrying
staphylococcal strains, which is higher than the prevalence of
fexA among cfr-positive staphylococci (17/33, 51.5%) obtained
from pigs in the Shandong province, China in 2011 (Wang et al.,
2012b). In addition, the cfr-carrying isolates may also persist and
be co-selected under the pressure of other agents; the results of
the antimicrobial susceptibility assay reveal that the cfr-positive
staphylococci exhibit a multiresistance phenotype, which is not
limited to PhLOPSA.
In the present study, S. sciuri (n = 38) was the predominant
species among the 40 cfr-positive staphylococcal strains. Previous
report indicates that S. sciuri might be a reservoir for resistance
and virulence genes both in veterinary and human medicine
(Nemeghaire et al., 2014). cfr was ﬁrst identiﬁed on plasmid
pSCFS1 from a bovine S. sciuri in Germany (Stefan et al., 2000)

and has since been detected on plasmids or the chromosomal
DNA in S. sciuri strains from pigs and cattle in Germany
(Kehrenberg and Schwarz, 2006) and from pigs, duck, chickens,
and chicken meat in China (Wang et al., 2012a, 2013a; Zeng
et al., 2014), indicating that S. sciuri is an important reservoir
for the cfr gene, which contributes to the spread of cfr among
animals and animal food. SmaI PFGE performed to further
elucidate the dissemination of cfr-positive S. sciuri, revealed a
variety of patterns. Most of the cfr-carrying S. sciuri isolates
were clonally unrelated, indicating that the spread of cfr in pig
farms was not due to clonal dissemination. The related PFGE
patterns exhibited by a number of strains from farm JXTC,
suggest that clonal dissemination of cfr-positive S. sciuri had
occurred at this farm. However, the main mechanism for the
dissemination of cfr among S. sciuri was probably horizontal
transmission mediated by mobile genetic elements. The presence
of a similar cfr-harboring module (IS21-558-cfr-tnpB) in six
randomly selected S. sciuri, which was identical to corresponding
regions of plasmids from animals, humans, and food, may
further conﬁrm this hypothesis. In addition, cfr was bracketed
by two copies of ISEnfa4 or IS256 in S. sciuri strain GDEP27
and JXTC28, respectively, which was highly similar to that in
Enterococcus or Staphylococcus isolates, further suggesting these
insertion sequences are associated with the transmission of cfr
among same or diﬀerent species from various sources.

Similarly, the two cfr-carrying E. coli showed diﬀerent XbaI
PFGE patterns and ST types. Additionally, cfr was ﬂanked by two
copies of IS26 in both strains, as previously reported in other
E. coli plasmids, whereas IS26 in strain EP28 was in the opposite
orientation. IS26 is widespread among gram-negative bacteria
and can mediate the mobility of cfr in gram-negative isolates
(Shen et al., 2013). The cfr-harboring module (IS26-cfr-IS26) was
the most prevalent genetic structure among E. coli strains, though
cfr was ﬂanked by two copies of IS256 on plasmid pSCEC2,
identiﬁed in an E. coli isolate (Zhang et al., 2014). IS26 may play
an important role in the dissemination of cfr, in accordance with
previous reports (Deng et al., 2014; Zhang R. et al., 2015).

Plasmid pHNEP28 obtained in the present study from E. coli
isolate EP28 was classiﬁed as F43:A-:B- by RST. Because cfr
has not been detected previously in an IncFII plasmid, plasmid
pHNEP28 was fully sequenced. In addition to the multiresistance
gene cfr, pHNEP28 contains four other resistance genes including
tet(M), blaTEM−1, ﬂoR, and qnrS1. Similar to cfr, tet(M) is
widely disseminated among various gram-positive organisms and
is commonly related to transposons Tn916 and Tn1545 (Shen
et al., 2008; Ye et al., 2008; Sadowy et al., 2013). Although
tet(M) found in pHNEP28 showed only 96–98% identity to
that from gram-positive isolates and only a slightly increased
to the tet(M)
(onefold) tetracycline MIC,
it was identical
identiﬁed in porcine E. coli
isolate CICYT-332 from Spain,
which was classiﬁed as a new E. coli tet(M) allele distantly
related to enterococcal tet(M) sequences based on phylogenetic
analysis; thus, the possibility of gram-positive to gram-negative
strain transfer of tet(M) cannot be ruled out. Additionally, the
coexistence of cfr and other resistance genes (tet(M), blaTEM−1,
ﬂoR, qnrS1) on the same plasmid not only confers resistance to
multiple agents, but also may allow for co-selection of cfr under

selective pressure imposed by other agents, thus facilitating the
dissemination of cfr. To date, the complete DNA sequences of
ﬁve cfr-carrying plasmids from E. coli, including IncA/C plasmid
pSCEC2 (Zhang et al., 2014), conjugative plasmid pFSEC-01
(Zhang R. et al., 2015), IncX4 plasmid pSD11 (Sun et al., 2015),
and the two similar plasmids pGXEC6 and pGXEC3, have been
reported (Zhang W.J. et al., 2015). Our ﬁndings not only expand
the range of plasmids that capture and spread cfr, but also
emphasize the importance of IncFII plasmids, which have been
reported to be involved in importance in the spread of many
resistance genes, such as ﬂoR, blaCTX−M, rmtB, oqxAB (Yang
et al., 2015), blaCMY−2, and blaKPC (Del Franco et al., 2015), and
blaNDM (Fiett et al., 2014).

CONCLUSION

This is the ﬁrst study to demonstrate the presence of cfr among
Staphylococcus spp. and E. coli isolates on the same farm and
the ﬁrst report of the complete sequence of a novel F43:A-:B-
plasmid carrying cfr. The extensive use of ﬂorfenicol as a
preventative and treatment agent in swine farms in China most
likely promotes and facilitates the spread of cfr across species
and genus boundaries, mainly via horizontal transfer mediated
by mobile elements including plasmids and insertion sequences
such as IS26 and IS256. Thus, rational use of ﬂorfenicol and
alternating antibiotic therapy are required in order to reduce cfr
dissemination, which constitutes a potential public health risk.
