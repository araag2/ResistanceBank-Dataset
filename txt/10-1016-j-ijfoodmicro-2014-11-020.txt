The risk of zoonotic transmission to humans highlights the need to understand the molecular ecology of
Staphylococcus aureus in foods. In this study, 142 S. aureus isolates obtained from various raw and processed
foods from Shanghai, China were characterized to determine their genetic diversity and virulence gene content.
A total of 16 clonal complexes (CCs), 34 staphylococcal protein A (spa) types, and 6 accessory gene regulator (agr)
allelic groups were identiﬁed and analyzed among the 142 S. aureus isolates. Among these, the genotype CC188-
t189-agr Ι was the most prevalent, constituting 28.2% of all isolates. The presence of virulence genes encoding 20
staphylococcal enterotoxins (se), toxic shock syndrome toxin (tsst1), exfoliative toxins (eta, etb, and etd),
Panton–Valentine leukocidin (lukS-PV and lukF-PV), as well as methicillin resistance gene (mecA), was deter-
mined by PCR. Of these S. aureus isolates, 72.5% harbored toxin genes, in which the most frequent toxin gene
was sep (43.7%), followed by sej (26.1%) and pvl (21.1%). In contrast, see, ses, set, tsst1, etb, and etd were not
found in any of the isolates tested. Eight S. aureus isolates (5.6%, 8/142), seven from raw milk and one from frozen
food, were mecA positive and resistant to oxacillin, thus were MRSA. The 142 S. aureus isolates displayed 52 dif-
ferent toxin gene proﬁles. Although no direct association was found between toxin gene proﬁle and the S. aureus
genotype, the isolates belonging to CC5, CC9, CC20, CC50, and CC72 clonal lineages in general carried more toxin
genes (N5) compared with the isolates in other CCs. It was also revealed that raw milk and raw meat were the
major sources of isolates containing multiple toxin genes. S. aureus isolates from food that were genetically highly
related, displayed diverse toxin gene proﬁles, implying the signiﬁcant role of horizontal gene transfer in the
emergence of highly toxigenic S. aureus isolates.

1. Introduction

Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of nosocomial infections
and often associated with food poisoning worldwide (Argudin et al.,
2010). The recent emergences of hospital-acquired methicillin resistant
S. aureus (HA-MRSA), community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA), as well
as livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) pose a serious threat to public
health. S. aureus is generally considered a host-speciﬁc organism; how-
ever, recent studies documented that LA-MRSA were able to colonize
and cause invasive disease in humans (Cui et al., 2009; Graveland
et al., 2011; Koeck et al., 2013; Neela et al., 2009). This risk of zoonotic
transmission to humans demands our deep understanding of the ecolo-
gy of S. aureus in food and food-related environments (Walther et al.,
2009).

S. aureus produces a wide variety of protein toxins such as entero-
toxins (SEs), toxic shock syndrome toxin1 (TSST-1), exfoliative toxins,
and Panton–Valentine leukocidin (PVL). TSST-1 diminishes the immune
response of a colonized host and is responsible for toxic shock syndrome
(Bergdoll et al., 1981). SEs are the major cause of staphylococcal food
poisoning, which has symptoms including nausea, violent vomiting,
and abdominal cramping, with or without diarrhea. To date, in addition
to the ﬁve classical enterotoxin types (SEA-SEE), 16 new types SEs of
SEls (SEG-SElV) have been described (Argudin et al., 2010; Omoe
et al., 2013). Many genes encoding enterotoxins are known to be asso-
ciated with pathogenicity islands where they are grouped either as a
gene cluster or organized as an operon. In addition, these genes are
often located on mobile genetic elements (MGEs), including prophages,
plasmids or transposons (Novick et al., 2010; Omoe et al., 2003; Ono
et al., 2008). Similarly, the genes encoding PVL, associated with severe
pneumonia and soft tissue infections, are also located on a prophage
(Boyle-Vavra and Daum, 2007). Furthermore, the genes (eta, etb, and
etd) encoding exfoliative toxins, responsible for staphylococcal scalded
skin syndrome, are also located on MGEs (Novick, 2003). Horizontal
transfer of MGEs among S. aureus strains not only promotes the

emergence of “super” bugs, but also accelerates the dissemination of
pathogenic S. aureus strains among animals as well as in humans
(Uhlemann et al., 2012).

Raw and processed meat, raw milk, and dairy products have been
reported to be the major food sources associated with S. aureus food poi-
soning (Kerouanton et al., 2007; Waters et al., 2011). Extensive studies
have been carried out to characterize the genotypes and virulence prop-
erties of S. aureus strains isolated from milk and meat (Aydin et al.,
2011; Casagrande Proietti et al., 2010; Hata et al., 2010; Pereira et al.,
2009). It has been reported that over a half of S. aureus isolates from
meat or milk are enterotoxigenic. Furthermore, it was suggested that
certain S. aureus lineages were speciﬁcally associated with milk, such
as CC97 (Hata et al., 2010). S. aureus is widespread in natural environ-
ments including both food and food-processing environments. In this
study, we evaluated the genetic diversity and the virulence potential
of S. aureus isolates obtained from raw milk, fresh meat, processed soy-
bean product, frozen foods, and fresh vegetables/fruits in Shanghai,
China. We then examined the possible link of virulence gene content
with S. aureus genotypes and food categories.

2. Material and methods

2.1. Isolation and identiﬁcation of S. aureus

A total of 607 food samples were randomly collected for S. aureus
isolation during a two year period (July 2010 to October 2012) in
Shanghai, China. Brieﬂy, 248 raw milk samples were obtained from
bulk tanks at 12 dairy farms with at least three samples being taken
from the each bulk tank. Fresh meat, frozen foods, processed soybean
products, and fresh vegetables and fruits were randomly purchased
from 14 local grocery stores in three districts (Minhang, Xuhui, and
Baoshan) in Shanghai. Fresh meat samples included 31 fresh beef
samples, 68 pork samples, and 29 chicken samples. The 61 frozen food
samples included various quick-frozen dumplings with meat and vege-
table ﬁllings which were stored under the freezing conditions for trans-
portation and sale. Processed soybean product samples included fresh
tofu (35), tofu skin (16), and dried tofu (17). The 102 fresh vegetable
and fruit samples were various leafy greens, mushrooms, apples, and
pears. Isolation and identiﬁcation of S. aureus were performed according
to China's National Technical Standard GB4789.10-2010. After incuba-
tion at 37 °C for 24 h on Baird–Parker agar plates with 5% egg yolk
and tellurite (BPA, Beijing Land Bridge Technology Ltd., Beijing, China),
up to two presumptive colonies (black colonies surrounded by
2–5 mm clear zones) were selected from S. aureus-positive food sample
(Wang et al., 2012). Putative S. aureus isolates were further tested for
hemolytic and coagulase activities, followed by PCR to identify the
S. aureus speciﬁc gene nuc1 (Brakstad et al., 1992). All S. aureus isolates
were routinely grown at 37 °C in tryptic soy broth (Becton Dickinson,
Sparks, MD).

2.2. Detection of staphylococcal toxin genes

Primers targeting 25 toxin genes, including 20 enterotoxin genes
(sea, seb, sec, sed, see, seg, seh, sei, sej, sek, sel, sem, sen, seo, sep, seq, ser,
ses, set and seu), the toxic shock syndrome toxin (tsst1), three exfoliative
toxin genes (eta, etb, andetd ), and the Panton–Valentine leukocidin
encoding genes (lukS-PV and lukF-PV) are listed in Table S1 (Supporting
information). PCR primers were synthesized at Sangon Co., Ltd (Shang-
hai, China). Genomic DNA of each S. aureus isolate was puriﬁed using a
modiﬁed cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method as described
previously (Xie et al., 2011). PCR was performed in a 25 μL volume con-
taining 50 ng of genomic DNA, 1U of Taq DNA polymerase (Fermentas
Inc., Glen Burnie, MD, USA), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.4 μM of each primer, and
0.2 mM of each dNTP, using an Eppendorf PCR system (Eppendorf,
Germany). Strains with known toxin genes were used as positive
controls: strain ATCC8095 for genes sea, sed, sej, sek, seq, and ser; strain

ATCC14458 for the seb gene; strain ATCC27664 for the see gene; strain
ATCC27661 for genes seg, sei, sem, sen, and seo; strain A176 for genes
seh and agr I; strain C299 for genes sep, mecA, and agr II; strain O114
for genes tsst1, sec, sel, seu, and agr III; strain F104 for genes eta and
agr IV; and strain O143 for etd gene (Xie et al., 2011).

2.3. Detection of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates

All isolates were tested for methicillin resistance by the disk diffu-
sion method according to the Clinical Laboratories Standards Institutes
guidelines (CLSI 2012). Oxacillin disks (1 μg) were used for detecting
methicillin-resistant isolates. S. aureus ATCC 25923 was used as a con-
trol. The mecA gene, which has been shown to confer methicillin resis-
tance to S. aureus (MRSA), was also detected by PCR using primers
described previously (Perez-Roth et al., 2001).

2.4. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST)

MLST was carried out as described previously (Enright et al., 2000).
Brieﬂy, seven S. aureus housekeeping genes (arcC, aroE, glpF, gmk, pta,
tpi, and yqiL) were ampliﬁed by PCR and bi-directional DNA sequencing
was performed for all of the PCR products. DNA sequences were assem-
bled in SeqMan (Lasergene 8, DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA). The allelic
proﬁles (represented by ST) were determined using the sequences of all
seven housekeeping genes described above using the default parame-
ters listed on the MLST home page (http://www.mlst.net/). The clonal
complex (CC) analysis was performed in eBURST v.3 as previously
described (Feil et al., 2004). CCs were composed of STs that shared at
least six of the seven housekeeping genes with a predicted ancestral
ST differing from the largest number of other STs at only one single
locus.

2.5. spa typing

The spa typing was performed as previously described (Harmsen
et al., 2003). Brieﬂy, the repeat-containing region of the staphylococcal
protein A gene (spa) was ampliﬁed by PCR followed by DNA sequencing
of the PCR products. The spa repeats and types were determined using
the Ridom Spa Server (http://spaserver.ridom.de/). If a spa repeat did
not match any spa types in the database, the sequence of the spa was
identiﬁed as a new spa type.

2.6. agr genotyping

The agr allele types (I–IV) were determined by multiplex PCR as
described by Gilot et al. (2002). These primers yield a PCR product of
441 bp, 575 bp, 323 bp, or 659 bp corresponding to agr group I, II, III,
and IV, respectively. For those isolates that yielded no ampliﬁcation
products by agr multiplex PCR, a ScaI RFLP analysis was performed as
described previously (Caﬁso et al., 2007). Brieﬂy, the 2583 bp agr
locus was ampliﬁed by PCR, followed by digestion with ScaI (Fermentas
Life Science, China). The resulting DNA fragments were separated using
gel electrophoresis on 1.0% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide
and visualized under UV light. If the agr primers yielded a PCR product
of a different size (i.e., not 2583 bp), DNA sequencing was performed to
determine if the PCR product was a result of non-speciﬁc ampliﬁcation.

2.7. Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was computed using SPSS v.18.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). Pearson's chi-square test (two-tailed) was used to an-
alyze the difference of the distribution of toxin genes among isolates
from various food isolates. The difference is considered signiﬁcant if
the p value is less than 0.05.

3. Results

3.1. Isolation and identiﬁcation of S. aureus

Of the 607 food samples, 117 (19.3%) were positive for S. aureus,
including 50 (20.2%) of the 248 raw milk samples, 36 (28.1%) of the
128 fresh meat samples, 13 (21.3%) of the 61 frozen food samples, 6
(8.8%) of the 68 processed soybean products, and 12 (11.8%) of the
102 vegetables and fruits (Table 1). In order to obtain more genetic
diversity of S. aureus, up to two isolates per sample were selected for
further analysis. But if isolates from a single food sample had the same
genotype determined by MLST, spa type, agr type, as well as an identical
toxin gene proﬁle, they were considered a single strain. Based on these
criteria, a total of 142 S. aureus isolates were obtained from the 117
S. aureus-positive food samples, including 58 from raw milk, 40 from
fresh meat, 20 from frozen foods, 16 from fresh vegetables and fruits,
and 8 from processed soybean products. Of these 142 isolates, eight
isolates (5.6%, 8/142) harbored the mecA gene and were resistant to
oxacillin, thus were MRSA. Seven of these were isolated from raw
milk, the other one from frozen food (Table 1).

3.2. Multilocus sequence typing

The 142 S. aureus isolates were examined by MLST. As shown in
Table 2, a total of 26 sequence types (STs) were revealed, which were
further grouped into 16 clonal complexes (CCs) including 2 new single-
tons (ST2634 and ST2635). Four STs (ST2632-ST2635) were submitted
as new registrations to the MLST database, because new alleles were
identiﬁed in the four STs. CC188, represented solely by ST188, was
the most prevalent genotype (28.9%, 41/142), followed by CC7 (21.8%,
31/142), and CC398 (9.9%, 14/142). CC5 was the most diverse clonal
complex, consisting of ST5, ST512, ST965, and ST2633. Furthermore,
the eight MRSA isolates were found in CC5 (ST965, 3), CC9 (ST9, 2),
CC59 (ST59, 2), and CC88 (ST88, 1) clonal lineages (Table 2).

The clonal lineages of S. aureus isolates were further analyzed based
on the food categories. As shown in Fig. 1, CC188 was the only common
genotype among isolates from all ﬁve different food categories. In con-
trast, CC72 was only identiﬁed in S. aureus isolates from meat, whereas
CC9 and CC59 were found in S. aureus isolates from milk. Interestingly,
CC398 was a prevalent clone in isolates from raw milk and veg/fruits.

3.3. spa typing

The 142 S. aureus isolates were grouped into 34 spa types, including
4 newly identiﬁed spa types (t10761, t10777, t10793, and t10798)
(Table 2). The most prevalent spa type was t189 (28.9%, 41/142),
which mainly corresponded to isolates of ST188. Based on MLST, all
ﬁve isolates within the CC88 had an identical sequence type (ST88).
However, each of them carried a unique spa type (Table 2, CC88). This
apparent superior discriminating power of spa typing had some excep-
tions. Some isolates had the identical spa type, but had differing STs
(t441-ST50, t441-ST59, and t441-ST88) (Table 2).

genotype.

b – represents no agr locus was detected.
c The STs represents the clonal lineages of MRSA detected in this study.

3.4. agr genotyping

The distribution of agr alleles among the 142 food isolates is provid-
ed in Table 3. By multiplex PCR, the agr alleles were successfully identi-
ﬁed in 130 isolates. The agr I was predominant, representing 78.5%
(102/130) of the isolates and was the prevailing agr type regardless of
the food source of S. aureus isolates. Twelve isolates repeatedly yielded
negative results by multiplex PCR, thus their agr types were determined
by the ScaI-RFLP method (Table 3). Based on ScaI patterns, ﬁve, one, and
one isolate were grouped to agr I, agr II, and agr IV, respectively, where-
as three isolates carried an agr variant. Furthermore, three isolates be-
longing to CC398-t571 yielded a larger PCR product (about 4 kb).
Further sequence analyses revealed that the larger PCR amplicons
were due to the insertion of a gene encoding a transposase between
agrD and agrC. Based on the agr sequence, these three isolates were
grouped as a variation of agr I. Two isolates belonging to CC97-t3297
were negative in both multiplex PCR and ScaI-RFLP analysis (Table 3).

3.5. Toxin gene proﬁles of S. aureus isolates

As shown in Table 4, there were 103 (72.5%) and 71 (50.0%) isolates
carrying one toxin gene and more than one toxin genes, respectively.

It was determined in this study that the 142 S. aureus isolates displayed
52 different toxin gene proﬁles, with one to 12 toxin genes per isolate
in different combinations (Table S2, Supporting information). The
most prevalent toxin gene proﬁle was the single enterotoxin gene, sep
(20.4%, 21/103), which was found among CC7, CC188, CC398, CC97,

and CC88. Different toxin gene proﬁles were identiﬁed among the
S. aureus lineages (Table S2), suggesting horizontal transfer of toxin
genes among S. aureus isolates. For example, four CC59 isolates
harbored between ﬁve and eight toxin genes each, whereas the other
two CC59 isolates were negative for any of the 25 toxin genes tested

in this study. Some enterotoxin genes are known to be grouped either as
a gene cluster or organized as an operon. In this study, the most preva-
lent toxin gene cluster was egc (20/142), which could be found among
CC5, CC9, CC20, CC50, and CC72. The combination of seb-sek-seq was
found in four CC59 isolates. The gene cluster sec-sel was found in isolates
that belonged to CC1, CC5, CC7, CC59, CC188, and CC398. The gene clus-
ter sed-sej-ser was found in isolates that belonged to CC5 and CC97.
Taken all together, these data suggested that there was no direct associ-
ation between toxin gene proﬁle and the genotype in these S. aureus
isolates.

The average toxin gene number in each clonal complex was also
examined, and a higher average number of toxin genes (N5) was
found in the isolates of CC5, CC9, CC20, CC50, and CC72 clonal lineages
compared to those belonging to other CCs (Fig. 2). Consistently, isolates
belonging to agr II (n = 14) or agr IV (n = 4) were associated with a
high average number of toxin genes (averaging 6.8 for agr II, and 5.8
for agr IV), whereas isolates belonging to agr I (n = 110) or agr III
(n = 12) were associated with a lower average number of toxin genes
(averaging 1.9 for agr I, and 1.8 for agr III) (Fig. 2).

3.6. Distribution of toxin genes

The presence of 25 toxin genes in the 142 S. aureus isolates is shown
in Fig. 3. The most frequent toxin gene was sep (43.7%). Notably, the
abundance of classic SE genes, sea (5.6%), seb (3.5%), sec (9.9%), and
sed (2.8%), often associated with staphylococcal food poisoning, was
relatively lower than many recently described SEs or SEls. Among the
142 isolates, see, ses, set, tsst1, etb, and etd were not found in any isolate,
whereas eta was only detected in one isolate (Fig. 3). PVL-encoding
genes were found in 30 (21.1%) of the S. aureus isolates, among which,
three isolates were MRSA. Furthermore, 14 of the 16 identiﬁed CCs
were found among PVL-positive isolates; only CC6 and CC9 were
excluded (Table S2). Moreover, it was found that three MSSA-CC398
isolates were PVL-positive.

The distribution of toxin genes among S. aureus isolates was further
analyzed based on the food categories. The results showed that the
incidence of sec, sed, seg, sei, sej, sel, sem, sen, seo, ser, and seu, was
signiﬁcantly different among the isolates from different food categories
(p b 0.05) (Fig. 3). It was found that the four classic enterotoxin genes

(sea, seb, sec, and sed) were found in isolates obtained from fresh
meat, raw milk, and processed soybean products. Two S. aureus isolates,
one from raw milk and the other from processed soybean products, car-
ried 12 toxin genes each (Table 4). The percentage of toxigenic S. aureus
isolates was higher for those isolates from meat (80%) or raw milk
(89.7%) than any other isolates recovered from processed soybean
products (50%), fresh vegetables/fruits (31.3%), or frozen foods (50%)
(Table 4).

4. Discussion

The genotypes of 142 S. aureus isolates obtained from raw and proc-
essed food commodities in Shanghai were characterized by three mo-
lecular typing methods. It appeared that spa typing had a higher
resolution than MLST since, for the majority of STs, more than one spa
type was detected in this study, which is consistent with a previous
study by Hata et al. (2010). Variation in the agr locus due to an insertion
mutation was reported previously (Caﬁso et al., 2007). In our study, we
identiﬁed three isolates belonging to CC398 carrying an insertion muta-
tion in their agr loci. Furthermore, we found the deletion of agr in two
S. aureus isolates belonging to CC97 (negative for both PCR and RFLP
methods), suggesting a potential limitation in utilizing this locus
for molecular typing of S. aureus isolates. It is well known that the agr
system controls the production of virulence factors. Montanaro et al.
(2010) found that different agr groups exhibited distinct patterns of vir-
ulence genes. Our study showed that isolates belonging to agr II and agr
IV had a higher incidence of toxin genes than those belonging to agr I
and agr III, suggesting that agr proﬁles may be associated with the viru-
lence potential of S. aureus (Cheung et al., 2011; Sugiyama et al., 2009).
Genotyping analysis of these 142 isolates revealed that clinical
S. aureus clones as well as livestock-associated lineages are widespread
in raw or processed food purchased in Shanghai. Among the 16 CCs
identiﬁed in our study, three clonal complexes, CC5, CC7, and CC188,
accounted for 57.0% of the total isolates examined. Interestingly, these
three clonal complexes were prevailing in clinical isolates associated
with bacteremia in China (He et al., 2013), suggesting food as a potential
environmental source of S. aureus isolates that have an important clini-
cal relevance. It was reported that CC97 is the dominant lineage from
bovine milk in Japan (Hata et al., 2010). In our study, the isolates

Average number of toxin genes

Fig. 2. The toxin gene content of S. aureus isolates based on MLST and agr genotyping. The average number of toxin genes was calculated based on the total number of toxin genes detected
in each clonal complex (CC) or agr group divided by the total number of isolates in each CC or agr group. The number in parentheses on the Y-axis represents the total number of isolates in
the corresponding CC or agr group. CC2634 and CC2635 were not included since there was only one isolate in each CC.

Fig. 3. The distribution of 25 toxin genes in S. aureus isolates from food. The percentage of strains that were positive for each toxin gene was calculated based on the origin of each food
isolate. Pearson's chi-square test (two-tailed) was used to test the difference in the virulence determinants distribution among isolates from different food sources and run based on mul-
tiple group comparison of different food sources. * demonstrates that the distribution of toxin genes was statistically signiﬁcantly different in isolates from different food sources (p b 0.05);
** demonstrates that the distribution of toxin genes was extremely signiﬁcantly different in isolates from different food sources (p b 0.001).

belonging to CC97 were found not only in raw milk but also in fresh
beef, which further implies that CC97 is associated with cattle. The
eight MRSA isolates identiﬁed in our study belonged to four clonal com-
plexes (CC5, CC9, CC59, and CC88) (Table 2). MRSA CC5 and MRSA CC88
are the prevalent clones among the HA-MRSA (Otto, 2012); and MRSA
CC59 is the prevalent clone among the CA-MRSA in Asia (Li et al.,
2013). The presence of these clonal lineages in food samples suggests
that humans contribute largely to the food contamination with MRSA,
which are likely to be introduced into the different food categories dur-
ing processing/preparation by food workers. MRSA CC9 is the prevalent
clone of LA-MRSA in Asian countries (Cui et al., 2009). To date the most
prevalent clone of LA-MRSA in Europe and Northern America is CC398,
which is rarely reported in Asia (Graveland et al., 2011). Price et al. re-
ported that LA-MRSA CC398 appears to have originated from human
MSSA-CC398, which acquired methicillin resistance in livestock (Price
et al., 2012). Further analysis showed that LA-MRSA CC398 possessed
many different staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec element
(SCCmec) types, which suggests promiscuous dissemination of SCCmec
cassette among strains of CC398 (Price et al., 2012; van Belkum et al.,
2008). Our study revealed that MSSA-CC398 was a common clone in
raw milk and meats from Shanghai. Therefore, antimicrobial selection
associated with food animal production raises the potential for MSSA-
CC398 in food to acquire the SCCmec cassette.

Clones of ST1, ST5, ST6, ST9, ST30, ST188, and ST943 are known to be
associated with staphylococcal food poisoning in East Asia (Cha et al.,
2006; Yan et al., 2012). Isolates with each of these genotypes were
found in all ﬁve food categories investigated. However, only the isolates
obtained from raw milk, fresh meat, and processed soybean products
were positive for the classic SE genes that contribute signiﬁcantly
to staphylococcal food poisoning. Therefore, the initial amount of
S. aureus together with the storage condition of milk, fresh meat, and
processed soybean products, should be under strict control to avoid
the production of SEs. The presence of toxigenic S. aureus strains in
these foods identiﬁes the potential sources of staphylococcal food poi-
soning, which is valuable information for the food industry and public

health agencies in Shanghai, China. Genes encoding new types of SEs
or SEls were more frequently identiﬁed than the classical SE genes in
this study, implying emergence of these “new” toxigenic strains in
Shanghai, as has been reported for other parts of the world (Aydin
et al., 2011; Bania et al., 2006). It was reported recently by Omoe et al.
(2013) that some of the new SEs, such as SElK, SElL, SElM, SElN, SElO,
SElP, and SElQ, could induce emetic reactions in monkeys, suggesting
a role of these new SEs in staphylococcal food poisoning.

ETA, ETB, and ETD are main human active exfoliative toxins. In our
study, only one isolate from chicken was positive for the eta gene, sug-
gesting a low frequency of eta in S. aureus food isolates examined in this
study. A low incidence of exfoliative toxin-encoding genes was reported
previously for milk samples and ready-to-eat food (Aydin et al., 2011;
Karahan et al., 2009). Furthermore, none of the 142 isolates examined
in our study was positive for the tsst1 gene, which has been found in
clinical S. aureus isolates associated with important clinical symptoms
(Xie et al., 2011). Notably, a high prevalence of PVL-encoding genes
was found in genetically diverse MSSA isolates from Shanghai in this
study. Previous studies have reported that PVL-positive MSSA strains
showed diverse genetic backgrounds, indicating that the bacteriophage
carrying the PVL genes can be spread easily (Chini et al., 2006). The ma-
jority of PVL-positive CC398 isolates described so far have been obtained
from humans (van Belkum et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2008), but few have
been found in livestock. In this study, three MSSA-CC398 isolates, from
milk and meat, were PVL-positive. Phylogenetic analysis has shown
that LA-MRSA CC398 appears to originate from human MSSA-CC398
(Price et al., 2012). Therefore, LA-MRSA CC398 may acquire the PVL
genes through horizontal gene transfer via bacteriophage. Considering
that CC398 is by far the most prevalent LA-MRSA worldwide, the ﬁnding
of PVL-encoding genes in CC398 food isolates poses a potential risks to
public health.

Although no direct association between S. aureus genotype and toxin
gene proﬁle was found in 142 isolates examined in our study, certain
genotypes such as CC5, CC9, CC20, CC50 and CC72 were found to carry
more toxin genes (N5) than other CCs. The association of CC5, CC20,

M. Song et al. / International Journal of Food Microbiology 195 (2015) 1–8

7

and CC72 with a high content of toxin genes was reported previously
(Varshney et al., 2009). In our study, CC5 was identiﬁed in isolates ob-
tained from fresh meat, raw milk, or processed soybean products;
S. aureus strains of CC20 and CC50 were obtained from fresh meat or
raw milk; CC9 S. aureus strains were isolated from milk, whereas strains
of CC72 were isolated from meat. The association of toxin gene rich-
genotypes with speciﬁc food matrices may explain the higher incidence
of toxin genes in milk or meat isolates compared to those from frozen
food or fresh vegetables and fruits observed in our study.

In summary, our study demonstrated genetic diversity and virulence
potential of S. aureus isolates obtained from different food categories at
retail in Shanghai. A large variation in genetic diversity as well as toxin
gene content was observed for S. aureus isolates from raw and processed
food commodities. It was revealed that both, raw milk and fresh meat
were the major sources of isolates containing multiple toxin genes.
However, as the majority of isolates were obtained from raw milk and
fresh meat, there is a possible bias on the genetic diversity of isolates
obtained from different food categories, which still needs to be further
investigated. Furthermore, S. aureus isolates from food that are geneti-
cally highly related, displayed diverse toxin gene proﬁles, implying a
role of horizontal gene transfer in the emergence of toxigenic S. aureus
isolates (Alibayov et al., 2014; Malachowa and DeLeo, 2010).
