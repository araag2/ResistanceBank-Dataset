This study determined the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization rate among 
ruminant  animals  slaughtered  for  human  consumption  and  contact  persons.  Nasal  and  milk  product 
samples  were  collected  from  the  main  abbatoir 
in  Maiduguri  and  analyzed  using  standard 
bacteriological procedures. A total of 510 samples were analyzed, 87 (17.1%) S. aureus isolates were 
identified, 33 (34.6%) MRSA and 54 (65.9%) methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolates 
were  detected.  19  (21.8%)  MRSA  and  17  (19.5)  MSSA  strains  were  recovered  from  cattle,  10  (12.5%) 
MRSA  isolates were  recovered  from  the Red Bororo  cattle breed  and  12  (17.1)  MSSA  from  carmelius 
dromedarius.  In  overall  antimicrobial  susceptibility  pattern,  MRSA  isolates  exhibited  multidrug 
resistance  pattern,  moderate  susceptibility  to  ciprofloxacin  (42.2%),  tobramycin  (36.4%),  amikacin 
(36.4%),  streptomycin  (42.2%),  while  majority  of  MSSA  isolates  demonstrated  high  sensitivity  pattern 
(>70%). Six (6.9%) S. aureus isolates (2 MRSA from cattle and 4 MSSA from sheep) exhibited inducible 
phenotype. In conclusion, the study findings reveal a relatively high MRSA colonization rate and unique 
resistance  pattern,  particularly  to  topical  antimicrobial  agents  (fusidic  acid,  mupirocin)  that  are  not 
routinely used in veterinary medical practice in the study area. The study findings provides a baseline 
epidemiological  information  for  better  understanding  of  MRSA  infections  in  human  and  veterinary 
medicine including foods of animal origin. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Staphylococcus aureus is one of the bacterial pathogens 
that  colonize  the  anterior  nares  of  human  and  different 

animals,  including  farm  animals  (Wertheim  et  al.,  2004; 
Weese and Duijkeren, 2009). The S. aureus pathogenicity

the  study  and 

 
 
 
 
of  resistant  pathogens  such  as  LA-MRSA  isolates.  The 
public health concern of LA-MRSA continued to heighten 
worldwide  because  of  possible  transmission  to  human 
from  animals  or  vice  versa  and  introduction  into  food 
chain.  Based  on  this  epidemiological  information,  we 
decided  to  assess  the  MRSA  colonization  rate  among 
ruminant  animals  slaughtered  at  the  major  abattoir  in 
Maiduguri, and the contact persons. 
 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
The  study  samples  were  collected  at  the  Maiduguri  Metropolitan 
Council major abattoir, Maiduguri between January and June 2012. 
The  University  of  Maiduguri,  Faculty  of  Veterinary  Medicine 
Institutional Review Board and Borno State Veterinary Department 
attached  with  abattoir  approved 
the  sample 
collection.  Demographic  information  of  the  animals  were  obtained 
from  animal  owners  and  the  information  entered  to  the  study 
questionnaire. Demographic information, the type and breed of the 
animal,  antibiotic/local  remedy  use  and  grazing  pattern  are 
presented  in  Table  1.  Local  remedy  was  defined  as  concoction 
prepared with herbs and local materials used by animals owner for 
treatment of animals infections. The author (IBM) was trained at the 
University  of  Maiduguri  Veterinary  Teaching Hospital  in  nasal  and 
milk samples collection from ruminant animals and at University of 
Maiduguri Teaching Hospital for nasal sampling of contact persons. 
Contact  person  was  defined  as  persons  with  close  contact  with 
ruminant  animals,  in  this  study  abbaitor  workers  are  classified  as 
contact  persons.  A  total  of  510  samples  were  collected,  the 
breakdown  is  as  follows:  102  camels,  145  sheep,  113  cattle,  113 
goat, 23 milk and 14 contact persons. 
 
 
Sampling and bacteriological identification procedures 
 
Sterile  cotton-tipped  swabs  were  inserted  into  the  inner  nasal 
septum  of  anterior  nare  of  ruminant  animals/contact  persons, 
rubbed several times, removed, capped and labeled appropriately. 
The  milk  products  were  collected  by  cleaning  the  udder  teat  with 
70% alcohol, the milk was expressed gently into the study labeled 
sterile  universal  bottle,  and 
the 
laboratory  for  analysis.  The  swabs/milk  products  were  inoculated 
onto blood (BA) and mannitol salt agar (MSA) plates, incubated at 
37°C  for  24  h.  Suspected  S.  aureus  colonies  with  heamolysis  on 
blood agar plates and yellowish appearance on mannitol salt agar 
plates  were  further  analyzed  using  standard  procedures:  colonial 
morphology,  Gram  reaction,  catalase,  tube  coagulase  and  DNase 
test (Cheesborough, 2006). 
 
 
Antibiotics susceptibility test  
 
Antimicrobial  susceptibility  test  was  determined  by  disc  diffusion 
method  using  Mueller-Hinton  agar  plates  accordingly  to  CSLI 
(2006)  guidelines.  The  following  antibiotic  discs  (manufactured  by 
Oxoid,  UK)  were  tested,  penicillin  (PEN),  ciprofloxacin  (CIP), 
tobramycin (TOB), kanamycin (KAN), amikacin (AMK), streptomycin 
(S),  tetracycline  (TET),  trimethoprim  (TRIM),  erythromycin  (ERY), 
clindamycin  (CLD),  rifampicin  (RF),  fusidic  acid  (FA),  mupirocin 
(MUP) (5 mg, 200 mg). The zone of inhibition around the discs were

is  attributable  to  the  expression  of  wide  range  of 
extracellular  toxins  and  virulence  factors  responsible  for 
superficial and systemic infections (Jarraud et al., 2002; 
Francis  et  al.,  2005).  Since  the  first  report  of  methicillin 
resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strain in 1961, the pathogen 
had attracted public health attention worldwide because it 
was  identified  as  the  major  causative  agent  of  hospital 
associated 
the  significant 
proportion  of  hospital  admission.  Subsequently,  MRSA 
strains was detected in the community setting termed as 
CA-MRSA,  with  distinctive  predisposing  risk  factors  and 
molecular  characteristics  (Francis  et  al.,  2005).  The 
epidemiological trend of MRSA continued to evolve in its 
phenotypic/molecular  characteristics,  predisposing  risk 
factors  and  associated  clinical  conditions  presen-
tations/complications. 

infections  responsible 

In  the  last  decade,  the  emergence  of  MRSA  among 
livestock,  particularly  pigs  and  other  ruminant  animals 
had  added  different  epidemiological  dimension  to  the 
understanding of the infection. These livestock are seen 
as  a  reservoir,  capable  of  transmitting the  pathogens  to 
human  or  vice  versa  in  the  community  (Vanderhaeghen 
et  al.,  2010;  Graveland  et  al.,  2011).  However,  the 
transmission  of  LA-MRSA  will  depend  on  the  level  of 
contact  between  human  and  animals,  while 
the 
introduction  into  food  chain  will  be  through  colonized 
animals (Kock et al., 2009; Lozano et al., 2011). 

In Nigeria, available data on the LA-MRSA colonization 
rate, predisposing risk factors and transmission between 
humans 
Therefore, 
epidemiological  information  on  LA-MRSA  pathogens  is 
imperative,  as  it  will  provide  a  baseline  information 
needed 
the  possible 
transmission  means  and 
its  overall  public  health 
implications in the community.

Maiduguri  is  the  administrative  capital  of  Borno  state 
located on latitude 9°.45’ and 11°.50’ North and longitude 
10°.05’  and  13°.  05’  North.  It  lies  within  the  semi-arid 
zone,  boarded  by  3  republics  of  Niger,  Chad  and 
Cameroon.  Livestock 
ruminant 
animals  are  done  at  the  larger  scale  for  economic 
purposes,  while  smaller  scale  involves  domestication  of 
animals  within 
the  compound  which  allows  close 
proximity  with  human  population.  The  state  remains  the 
major  source  of  ruminant  animals,  transported  to  other 
parts  of  Nigeria  in  Nigeria.  In  the  northeastern  Nigeria, 
few  epidemiological  data  on  MRSA  in  human  infections 
has been published (Okon et al., 2013), but there are no 
similar  data  on  veterinary  infections.  Considering  the 
geographical location, the intra-and inter-human activities 
and rearing and movement of large number of ruminant 
animals  within  and  outside  the  state,  all  these  activities 
constitute major  predisposing  risk factors for emergence

measured  and  interpreted  as  sensitive,  intermediate  and  resistant 
according to CSLI breakpoint. Methicillin resistance expression was 
detected  by  disc  diffusion  method  using  oxacillin  and  cefoxitin 
discs.  

The D-test for demonstration of inducible phenotype was carried 
out as previously described by Fiebelkorn et al. (2003), in which the 
erythromycin and clindamycin discs were placed at 12-14mm apart 
and inducible phenotype (iMLSB) was indicated by flattening of the 
clindamycin  zone  adjacent  to  the  erythromycin  discs.  S.  aureus 
ATCC 26923 was used as a standard control strain. 
 
 
Data analysis 
 
Data  was  analyzed  by  using  SPSS  version  16.0,  the  values were 
expressed  as 
frequency  of  occurrence  and  percentages. 
Comparison of the demographic variables was determined by Chi-
square test, p values <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

DISCUSSION 
 
The  epidemiology  of  MRSA  infections  continued  to 
evolve,  with  different  characteristic  patterns  and  asso-
ciated  clinical  complications  are  reported.  Adequate 
knowledge on the predisposing risk factors and infection 
control  approach  within  the  hospital  and  community 
setting  is  of  utmost  importance.  The  emergence  of  LA-
MRSA has added additional epidemiological dimension to 
the  understanding  of  MRSA  infections.  In  developing 
countries,  particularly  in  sub-saharan  Africa  with  paucity 
of epidemiological data on MRSA infections, future data 
are needed from both human and animal population. To 
the  best  of  our  knowledge,  this  is  first  report  of  MRSA 
colonization rate among ruminant animals slaughtered for 
human consumption and contact persons from Maiduguri, 
Nigeria.  Main  findings  of  our  study  are,  (i)  MRSA 
colonization  rate  among 
the  ruminant  animals  and 
contact  person,  (ii)  antimicrobial  susceptibility  pattern  of 
S.  aureus  isolates  and  (iii)  the  demographic  variables 
associated  with  MRSA  colonization.  Therefore, 
the 
findings have shed light on LA-MRSA colonization in the 
study  area  and  its  public  health  and  food  safety  (Lee, 
2003; Zschock et al., 2005). 

isolates  were  detected.  The 

In  this  study,  the  S.  aureus  colonization  rate  was  87 
(17.1%),  33  (37.9%)  MRSA  isolates  and  54  (62.1%) 
MSSA 
low  MRSA 
colonization rate as compared to MSSA pattern is similar 
to the pattern reported in other studies (Alzohairy, 2011; 
Gharsa et al., 2012). MRSA colonization rate differs with 
the animals sampled and geographica location, in study 
conducted  in  Saudi  Arabia  high MRSA  colonization  rate 
was  recorded  among  camels  (35.5%)  and  cattle,  19 
(21.8%)  as  compared  to  21.8%  in  cattle  and  4.6%  in 
sheep recorded in our study. While varied rate had been 
reported  in  other  studies,  44.8%  in  France  and  29%  in 
Tunisia (Vautor et al., 2005; Gharsa et al, 2012). The low 
MRSA  colonization  rate  of  4.6%  is  similar  to  the  level 
reported  in  Poland  (Stastkova  et  al.,  2009).  Apart  from 
the fact that high MRSA and MSSA colonization rate was 
recorded among the cattle in this study, it is also of public 
health concern, because the cattle constitute the highest 
number of ruminant animals reared within the community 
in the study area and the major source of animal proteins. 
Reason  for  public  health  concern  are,  (i)  possible 
transmission  and  dissemination   of   the MRSA  isolates 

Mai-siyama et al.          2647 

 
 
 
could  occurs  through  the  level  of  contact  that  include 
close  proximity  through  rearing  and  domestication,  (ii) 
nasal  dropping  during  movement  within  the  community 
and  (iii)  contamination  of  meat  and  milk  products  by 
colonized  handlers.  Studies  have  reported  that  MRSA 
colonization of cattle posed a potential risk of up to 60% 
transmission to the contact persons (Lee, 2003; Juhasz-
Kaszanyitzky et al., 2007). 

In  this  study,  the  MRSA  colonization  rate  among 
contact  persons  was  3.4%,  this  level  is  lower  when 
compared  with  the  level  reported  in  other  studies  that 
assessed  the  level  of  contact  as  a  predisposing  risk 
factor for colonization. In these studies, the overall MRSA 
colonization  rate  was  6.5% 
level  reported  among 
veterinary  personnel,  16%  among  veterinarian  handling 
large  animals  and  4.4%  among  those  handling  small 
animals  (O’Mahony  et  al.,  2005;  Simoons-Smit  et  al., 
2000;  Beth  et  al.,  2006;  Hanselman  et  al.,  2006). 
Nevertheless, the level of MRSA colonization rate among 
contact persons varied with geographic location, type of 
animals  and  culture  methods  employed  in  the  studies 
(Vanderhaeghen et al., 2010; Graveland et al., 2011). 

In  our  study, 

The  MRSA  contamination  of  milk  and  dairy  products 
are  known  to  be  through  infection  like  masititis  or  the 
hands of the farmers. The level of milk and dairy products 
contamination  with  MRSA  isolates  varies  with  geogra-
phical location, as low contamination level is reported in 
European countries, the USA and Canada in contrast to 
high  level  reported  in  Asia  and  Africa  (Pexara  et  al., 
2013). 
the  MRSA  colonization  rate 
recovered from milk product sampled was 2.3%, this level 
is lower as compared to the level reported in other similar 
studies, 17.9% in Iran (Alian et al., 2012), 60% in Ethopia 
(Daka et al., 2012), 36% in Jos, Nigeria (Suleiman et al., 
2012)  and  6%  in  South  Africa  (Ateba  et  al.,  2010). 
Variation  in  the  colonization  rate  might  be  due  to  the 
animal  production  systems,  presence  of  multiple  animal 
species  within 
facilitate 
transmission and dissemination of the pathogens and the 
animals  handling  processes  particularly  during 
the 
milking  (Vanderhaeghen  et  al.,  2010;  Graveland  et  al., 
2011). 

the  same  area 

that  could 

We  observed  that  the  S.  aureus  isolates  showed  3 
distinctive  patterns:  low,  moderate  and  high  resistance 
pattern,  with  the  MRSA  exhibiting  multidrug  resistance 
pattern. The interesting finding of this study is, the MRSA 
isolates  showed  high  resistance  pattern 
topical 
antibacterial  agents  (fusidic  acid,  mupirocin),  that  are 
clinically used for MRSA decolonization/decontamination 
in  human  and  veterinary  medicine.  These 
topical 
antibacterial  agents  are  not  routinely  used  in  veterinary 
practices  in  the  study  area.  Therefore,  the  reason  for 
such resistance pattern by the S. aureus isolates remain 
unclear.  Future  research  studies  are  needed  to  provide 
insight,  through  molecular  characterization  of  resistance 
genes. Although, some studies have reported fusidic acid 
and mupirocin-resistant  S. aureus  strains  in human and

varied  with  different 
geographical  locations  (Udo  et  al.,  2001;  Chen  et  al., 
2010).  

In  Nigeria,  the  frontline  antimicrobial  agents  routinely 
used in human and veterinary medicine are tetracycline, 
erythromycin,  penicillin  and  some  quinolones.  In  this 
study, of the antimicrobial agents tested, both MRSA and 
MSSA isolates demonstrated high degree of sensitivity to 
some  aminoglycosides  like  tobramycin,  amikacin  and 
streptomycin. This pattern revealed that these agents are 
not  only  still  efficacious  for  staphylococcal  infections 
treatment and management, but also as alternate option 
for  treatment  of  livestock  infection  due  to  multidrug 
resistant  S.  aureus  strains  in  veterinary  settings.  In 
addition, 6 (6.9%) S. aureus strains (2 MRSA from cattle

which  predominate  in  MSSA  AS  compared  to  MRSA 
(Alzohairy, 2012; Schreckenberger et al., 2004; Levin et 
al.,  2005).  As  obtainable  worldwide,  macrolides  are 
frontline  antibiotics  widely  used  for  the  treatment  of 
human  and  animal  infections.  Extensive  usage  of  these 
antibiotics  results  in  selection  of  resistant  bacteria  and 
genetic  determinants  of  resistance  can  be  transmitted 
from  animals  to  humans  via  foodstuffs  (Perreten  et  al., 
1998;  Schlegelova  et  al.,  2004).  The  D-test  is  used  to 
demonstrate  the  constitutive  and  inducible  phenotype, 
and  determination  of  possible  chemotherapeutic  failure 
(Levin et al., 2005).

studies  are  encouraged 
worldwide to provide epidemiological data on LA-MRSA, 
but  there  are  limitation,  particularly  in  comparison  with 
epidemiological  data.  These  limitations  include  lack  of 
standardization in the methodology employed, in addition, 
Staphylococcus  spp.,  like  Staphylococcus  intermedius, 
Staphylococcus 
hyicus, 
Staphylococcus 
Staphylococcus 
pseudointermedius,  produced  positive  tube  coagulase 
result that may be detected as MRSA, particularly in low-
resource  laboratory  in  which  analysis  are  based  on 
phenotypic characterization (Morgan, 2008). 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
Based  on  the  findings  of  this  study,  we  can  state  that 
MRSA colonization rate in ruminant animals and contact 
persons  might  be  assumed  to  be  relatively  high  for 
geographical 
pre-existing 
epidemiological  data  for  comparison  and  the  resistance 
pattern is of public health concern. The reason being that 
these resistant strains and genes can be transmitted and 
disseminated  between  human  and  animals,  and 
subsequently  into  the  food  chain.  The  scenario  could 
worsen in this area if appropriate attention is not paid.
