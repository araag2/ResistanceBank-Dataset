Abstract Salmonellosis is an important disease frequently
associated with diarrhea in calves. From January to September
2009, a cross-sectional study involving 91 dairy farms was
conducted to determine the prevalence of Salmonella spp.
infection in cattle in Al-Dhulail Valley, Jordan. A total of
910 calve and cow fecal samples were collected. Information
on farm management practices was obtained through personal
interviews using a standardized questionnaire and was tested
as risk factors for Salmonella spp. positivity in farms by using
logistic regression analysis. Standard conventional methods
for Salmonella isolation and serotyping were used, and the
disk agar diffusion test was used for antimicrobial testing.
The herd-level prevalence of Salmonella spp. in calves, cows,
and dairy farms was 12, 12, and 23 %, respectively, and the
individual-level prevalence was 4 % for calves, cows, and
dairy farms. Forty-six percent of the dairy farms had calf di-
arrhea, and 4 % had cow diarrhea. Seven (17 %) of the 42
farms with calf diarrhea had Salmonella. However, only 7 %
(95 % CI: 4, 10) of the 221 diarrheic and 1 % (95 % CI: 0.2, 4)
of the 234 of non-diarrheic calves had Salmonella. A total of
33 Salmonella isolates were obtained from the fecal samples:
12 isolates were Salmonella typhimurium, 6 were Salmonella
montevideo, 6 were Salmonella anatum, 2 were Salmonella
enteritidis, and 7 isolates were not serotyped. All isolates were
susceptible to ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole,
gentamycin, neomycin, colisitin, and amoxicillin at 100, 91,
85, 79, 79, and 70 %, respectively. Out of the 11 variables/

was associated with high odds of infection among calves
(OR=5.6) and farms (OR=7.0).

Introduction

Salmonellae are common food-borne pathogens (CDC 2013),
but they may also be transmitted directly to individuals living
and working on farms (Shua et al. 2012). They infect many
animal species (Kagambèga et al. 2013) and survive in the
environment (Toth et al. 2013), feed, and water (Jones 2011;
Levantesi 2012). They are shed in feces by apparently healthy
(Kagambèga et al. 2013; Toth et al. 2013) and diarrheic ani-
mals (Cummings et al. 2010). The occurrence of salmonello-
sis in 1- to 8-week-old calves has been reported worldwide
(Cummings et al. 2010). Substantial economic losses due to
mortality and poor growth of infected animals, as well as
constituting a public health hazard, were reported (Fraser
et al. 2010). The prevalence of Salmonella infections associ-
ated with calf diarrhea could reach 18.7–43.5 % and that in
calves showing no diarrhea could reach 27.7 % (Moussa et al.
2010; Youssef and El-Haig 2012). Salmonella infections in
cattle have been reported worldwide (Carrique-Mas et al.
2010; Lombard et al. 2012; Cho and Yoon 2014). The most
frequently isolated serotypes from cattle are Salmonella
montevideo, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella dublin,
Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella anatum, Salmonella
newport, Salmonella cerro, Salmonella kentucky, and Salmo-
nella orion (Alam et al. 2009; Brichta-Harhay et al. 2011;
Strawn et al. 2014).

Several factors associated with the reduction or the enhanc-
ing of Salmonella fecal shedding were reported; type of pro-
duction system (Vanselow et al. 2007), poor hygiene (Boqvist
and Vågsholm 2005), large herd size, lack of a clean visitors’
parking area (Davison et al. 2006), infected neighboring
herds, contact with wild birds and rodents, presence of Salmo-
nella carriers (Nielsen et al. 2007), contaminated feeds (Jones
2011), use of nipple feeders (Svensson and Jensen 2007), and
access to surface water (lake, pond, river, or stream) (Fossler
et al. 2005) increased the risk of fecal Salmonella spp. shed-
ding in dairy farms. By contrast, herds closed to incoming
cattle (Berge et al. 2006), calving in an individual animal area
within a building (Fossler et al. 2005) and colostrum ingestion
and vaccine technology (Hermesch et al. 2008), decrease the
risk of fecal Salmonella shedding.

The prevalence of Salmonella spp. shedding in cattle has
never been studied in Jordan. Thus, this study aimed to deter-
mine the herd- and individual-level prevalences of Salmonella
fecal shedding in dairy farms in Al-Dhulail Valley, Jordan.
Selected risk factors for Salmonella fecal shedding were stud-
ied at the herd level in terms of herd status, i.e., calf, cow, or
calf and cow status. Moreover, Salmonella serovar isolates
were identified, and their antibiotic resistance profiles were
studied.

Materials and methods

Animals and study area

In Jordan, most dairy cattle farms are located in Zarqa gover-
norates, Al-Dhulail Valley region and are operated in a semi-
intensive system. The maximum cattle herd size is 1350, and
the minimum is 25 (quartiles; Q1=50, Q2=75, Q3=135). The
maximum number of calves per farm is 250, and the minimum
is 5 (quartiles; Q1=8, Q2=12, Q3=16). The Holstein–Frie-
sian cattle breed is the most common. Most of the dairy farms
adopt the same management system of the herd being divided
into three groups: lactating cows, dry cows, and growing
heifers. The stage of lactation is not considered. Pregnant
cows are isolated before parturition in individual pens in the
barn. After delivery, the calves spend about 3 h with the dam
to feed on colostrum and are then they feed on the dam’s milk
or milk replacer. Two milk meals are given daily by using
nipple drinkers or buckets. Feeding on starter ration begins
in the second week of age. Calf housing is conducted in two
systems, namely individual and group pens. The average
weaning age is 3 months. After weaning, calves are trans-
ferred to another pen. Dairy farms are adjacent to each other
and all are infested with rodents (100 %). Some farms control
rodents (40 %) by using poison bait (30 %) and sticky trap
(10 %). Cattle farms use formalin, iodophors, and hydrated
lime as barn disinfectants.

Trop Anim Health Prod

Al-Dhulail Valley has two sources of water: underground
artesian well and municipality pipe. In the farm, the water
system includes an underground cistern connected to a farm
tank that feeds drinkers. No Salmonella vaccine is used in the
studied farms, and the commonly used antibiotics are
gentamycin, trimethoprim–sulphamethoxazole, penicillin,
amoxicillin, and tetracycline.

Sample size determination

The prevalence of Salmonella spp. in dairy farms in Jordan
has not been investigated previously, and thus, it is assumed to
be 50 %. As 95 % level of confidence and 5 % absolute
precision were required, the appropriate sample size was cal-
culated at 73 according to Thrusfield (2007). A total of 91
representative farms were selected from Al-Dhulail Valley.
The study had at least 80 % power at the 5 % significance
level to detect an odds ratio (OR)≥2 for the risk factors present
in 50 % of the control and an OR≥3 for those present in 20 %
of the control.

Farm sampling and survey

Systematic sampling was used where a list of the operating
dairy farms in the study area (n=160) (Anon 2009) was ob-
tained. Odd numbers were picked aside from the list, and 16
even numbers were picked every 10. A total of 96 farms were
contacted, with 91 farms agreeing to participate and 5 declin-
ing. Ten fecal samples were collected randomly using random
tables from each farm, five from lactating cows, and five from
calves under 1 month of age.

The median size of the cattle farm in the studied area was
75 and that of the calves in the farm was 12. The sample size
required 95 % certainty that at least one animal in the sample
would be positive if the disease was present or above the
specified level. The minimum number of diseased animal as-
sumed to be in a herd was one. For a population of 30–10,000
individuals, the number of diseased animals was determined
on the basis of the assumed prevalence of 50 % and the min-
imum sample size of five using Cannon and Roe’s (1982)
formula (Martin et al.1994). A total of 910 samples (455 from
cows and 455 from calves) were collected from January to
September 2009 from Al-Dhulail Valley.

Data collection

A survey was conducted with the help of a purposely designed
questionnaire to collect information on calf housing, frequen-
cy of cleaning, barn disinfection, calf feeding, water source,
type of water tank, diarrhea, use of antibiotics, and rodent
control (Table 4). Close-ended questions were used. Complet-
ing the survey form and sampling were done at the same time
of the sample collection.

Salmonella isolation, identification, and serotyping

One gram of each fecal sample was taken aseptically, added to
10 mL Rappaport Vassiliadis broth (Scharlau, Spain) and in-
cubated for 24 h at 43 °C. After incubation, the inoculated
broth was streaked onto Brilliant green agar media (DIFCO).
Plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 24–48 h, and
suspected pink Salmonella colonies were picked and trans-
ferred to Kligler’s iron agar slants (KIA) (DIFCO). The inoc-
ulated KIA slants were incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h. Slants
exhibiting a typical Salmonella pattern were further tested by
biochemical tests (Markey 2013). Salmonella serotyping was
done according to the method of (Popoff et al. 2004) using
Salmonella polyvalent O antisera A-G group, poly H antisera
phases I and II, and monovalent O and H antisera factors
(National Salmonella Centre-Statens Serum Institute, Copen-
hagen, Denmark).

Antibiotic susceptibility

The agar disk diffusion test was carried out using the Clinical
and Laboratory Standard Institute guidelines (CLSI 2008).
Ten antimicrobial agents were used: penicillin G 10 units,
amoxicillin 25 μg, gentamicin 10 μg, erthromycin 15 μg,
neomycin 30 μg, trimethoprim–sulphamethoxazole 1.25/
23.75 μg, ciprofloxacin 5 μg, tetracycline 30 μg, doxycycline
30 μg, and colisitin (10 μg) (OXOID).

Statistical analyses

Data were stored in a database and analyzed using SPSS ver-
sion 16.0 (Anon 2007) and Epi-Info (CDC, Atlanta, Georgia).
The 95 % confidence interval was calculated for the preva-
lence (Thrusfield 2007). Chi-squared analysis was used to test
the significance among the proportions, and the odds ratios
were calculated. The dependent variable was Salmonella spp.
status, coded as 0 (negative) or 1 (positive). Analyses were
conducted at the farm level, but the farm status was based on
calf, cow, or calf and cow (farm) status. A total of 11 variables/
categories were tested (Table 4). The screening of the signif-
icant variables to be used in the final logistic regression was
conducted using simple logistic regression. The variables that
were statistically significant P<0.2 (two sided) were included
in the multivariable model forward selection. P value of <0.05
was considered significant.

Results

Prevalence

The herd- and individual-level prevalences of Salmonella in-
fections among calves, cows, and dairy farms are summarized

in Table 1. At the herd level, 91 calf, cow, and dairy farms
were examined, with prevalences of 12, 12, and 23 %, respec-
tively. At the individual levels, 455, 455, and 910 calf, cow,
and dairy farm animals were examined, with a prevalence of
4 % for all groups. A total of 33 Salmonella isolates were
obtained, identified, and serotyped from 910 fecal samples.
The 33 Salmonella species were isolated from 21 dairy farms
(from 16 calves and 17 cows). S. typhimurium was isolated
from six farms, S. anatum was isolated from four farms,
S. enteritidis was isolated from two farms, S. montevideo
was isolated from four farms, and non-serotyped Salmonella
species was isolated from five farms (Table 2).

Diarrhea and Salmonella infections

Forty-two 46 % (95 % CI: 39, 59) out of the 91 cattle farms
had calf diarrhea, and only four 4.4 % (95 % CI: 0.1, 8) had
cow diarrhea. Seven (17 %) (95 % CI: 0.7, 15) of the 42 farms
with calf diarrhea had Salmonella, and two 4 % (95 % CI: 0, 6)
of the 49 non-diarrheic calf farms had Salmonella. The
individual-level prevalence of Salmonella among diarrheic
calves was 7 % (95 % CI: 4, 10) of the 221 calves and 1 %
(95 % CI: 0.2, 4) of the 234 non-diarrheic calves. None of the
four diarrheic cows had Salmonella.

Antibiotic susceptibility

Antibiotic susceptibility patterns showed that the 33 Salmonella
isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim–sulfa-
methoxazole, gentamycin, neomycin, colisitin, amoxicillin, tet-
racycline, and doxycycline at 100, 91, 85, 79, 79, 70, 61, and
49 %, respectively. Erythromycin and penicillin showed 100 and
66 % resistance, respectively, as demonstrated in Table 3.

Multivariable analyses

At the farm level, out of the 11 variables/categories, frequency
of cleaning every 2 months or more, type of water tank, anti-
biotic treatment, and diarrhea were associated (P<0.2) with
Salmonella spp. positivity in calves (Table 4). After forward
selection, the model only had frequency of cleaning every
2 months or more (Table 5). Barn disinfection, type of water
tank, and antibiotic treatment were associated (P<0.2) with
Salmonella spp. positivity in cows in the screening (Table 4).
After forward selection, the model only had barn disinfection
(Table 5). Type of calf housing, frequency of cleaning every
2 months or more, diarrhea, gentamicin, and trimethoprim–
sulphamethoxazole were associated (P<0.2) with Salmonella
spp. infection in calves in the screening (Table 4). After for-
ward selection, the model only had frequency of cleaning
every 2 months or more (Table 5). Every model contains
one factor only for calves, cows, and dairy farms; thus, there
is no correlation.

Discussion

Prevalence

The presence of Salmonella infection in dairy farms was evi-
dent in Al-Dhulial Valley, with 12 % farm-level prevalence of
infection among calves and 12 % among cows. The herd-level
Salmonella shedding in calves and cows in Jordan (12 %) was
similar to other findings (Davison et al. 2006). However,
higher or lower prevalences were reported in calf and cow
dairy herds in other countries (Fossler et al. 2005; Nielsen
et al. 2011). The variations in both herd- and individual-
level prevalences reported in different countries reflect the
effects of a wide range of different management risk factors
(Vanselow et al. 2007; Alam et al. 2009; Jones 2011). Cattle
herds with Salmonella infection may represent the main ani-
mal source of Salmonella infection in human. Salmonella can
be spread from cattle to human via direct contact, contamina-
tion of the environment (water sources), and contamination of
meat and milk products (Schlundt et al. 2004).

In Al-Dhulail Valley, all Holstein–Friesian animals are
reared under an intensive closed system, and farms are located
beside each other under poor hygienic conditions in a limited
area. Animals can become passive carriers for weeks, months,
or even years of some serovars by constantly reacquiring Sal-
monella from the environment (Anon, 2009, 2011).

The current results showed S. montevideo infection in one
farm involving both calves and cows (Table 2). The rest of the
Salmonella-infected farms had either infected calves or infect-
ed cows but not both. This finding may reflect the successful
separation between cows and calves in these farms.

Diarrhea and Salmonella infection

In this study, 46 % of the examined herds had calf diarrhea,
and Salmonella spp. was isolated from 17 % of them com-
pared with 4 % from calf herds without diarrhea. At the indi-
vidual level, the prevalence of Salmonella spp. was 7 %
among diarrheic calves and 1 % in non-diarrheic ones. These
findings are in agreement with other reports (DEFRA 2005;
Berge et al. 2006; Cho and Yoon 2014). Similarly, the pres-
ence of diarrhea increased the risk of Salmonella shedding
(Cummings et al. 2010). However, diarrhea in calves is mul-
tifactorial caused by different pathogens (Achá et al. 2004).
By contrast, cows shed Salmonella spp. without showing di-
arrhea. Salmonella is carried asymptomatically Bpassive
carriers^ in the intestine or gall bladder of many animals and
is continuously or intermittently shed in the feces and contami-
nate the environment (Fossler et al. 2005).

Salmonella serotypes

investigation, four Salmonella serovars
In the current
were identified from calves and cows for the first time
in Jordan (Table 2). S. typhimurium was the most prev-
alent. In several studies, S. typhimurium was reported as
the most common cause of salmonellosis in calves
(DEFRA 2005). Moreover, S.
typhimurium has been
found to transmit from animals to man and cause a
variety of clinical symptoms (Cherry et al. 2004; Okoro
et al. 2015). Other serovars, such as S. enteritidis,
S. montevideo, and S. anatum, are shed in feces and
associated with calf diarrhea (Izzo et al. 2011b).

trimethoprim–sulphamethoxazole in calves and cows
(Table 4). Variable effects of antimicrobial agents on the
shedding of Salmonella were reported. Cattle treated sys-
temically with antimicrobials within 14 days of sampling
were more likely to be Salmonella-negative than non-
treated cattle (Fossler et al. 2005). In pre-weaned calves,
the significant factor associated with decreased fecal shed-
ding of S. enterica was the use of antimicrobial-
supplemented milk replacer (Berge et al. 2006). By con-
trast, the exposure to and the recent treatment with anti-
microbial agents of heifers and cows were considered risk
factors that increase the probability of Salmonella isola-
tion (Cho and Yoon 2014). Izzo et al. 2011a demonstrated
that in adult cattle, antibiotics could improve recovery and
lessen the severity of diarrhea, but they would likely ex-
tend the duration of S. enterica shedding. However, in
claves and young stock, the subtherapeutic use of antibi-
otics in milk replacer could actually make the diarrhea
worse and results in emerging of resistant strains. There-
fore, antimicrobial-resistant profiles were created.

It is worth a mention that S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis
which were isolated from dairy farms are considered as food-
borne pathogens that cause serious illness in man (DuPont
2007). These two serotypes were found by many investigators
to be multiresistant to antimicrobial agents which increase
their risk to human and animal safety (Brichta-Harhay et al.
2011; Seyfarth et al. 2014).

Barn disinfection was found to be a reducing factor for Sal-
monella shedding in cows in Jordan (Table 5). The studied
farms used formalin, iodophors, and hydrated lime disinfec-
tants, which have known killing effects on Salmonellae
(McLaren et al. 2011). They use these disinfectants as spray
after cleaning and at the entrance of the farms for vehicles and
personnel. Less frequent cleaning (every 2 months or more)
was associated with high Salmonella shedding in dairy farms
and calves. Inadequacy of cleaning was reported to be associ-
ated with Salmonella shedding. Improved cleaning and disin-
fection routines for cattle transport vehicles and animal

markets are necessary to control salmonellosis in calves
(Dee et al. 2005). In Jordan, water shortage forces farmers to
decrease the frequency of cleaning, and only a few farms have
high water pressure, and none use hot water for cleaning.

Cleaning frequency of less than 2-month period and ordi-
nary disinfection routines for dairy farms, cattle transportation
vehicles, and the workers boot and proper use of antimicro-
bials are expected to reduce calf diarrhea and salmonella in-
fection. The adaptation of these findings by dairy farm owners
and workers is expected to improve the poor hygienic condi-
tion that leads to reduction of calf diarrhea and salmonella
prevalence, thus results in increase dairy farm production
and upgrade the milk and meat quality. The countries located
in the Mediterranean agro-ecological zone are characterized
by similar climatic and environmental properties; therefore,
the finding of the current study in Jordan could be adopted
in the countries of this zone.

Conclusions and recommendations

Dairy cattle farms in Al-Dhulail Valley had high herd-level
prevalence of diarrhea in calves, cows, and cattle farms.
S. typhimurium, S. enteritidis, S. montevidio, and S. anatum
contributed to calf diarrhea. Isolated Salmonella spp. was
trimethoprim–
most susceptible to ciprofloxacin,
sulphamethoxazole, and gentamycin. Barn disinfection was
associated with the reduction of Salmonella shedding.
Cleaning frequency in less than 2 months is expected to re-
duce Salmonella shedding. Veterinary extension should edu-
cate farmers about the frequency of cleaning, proper use of
disinfectants, and proper use of antimicrobials which is ex-
pected to reduce calf diarrhea and salmonella infection. The
control of Salmonella infections in dairy farms will certainly
impact on disease control efforts in human.
