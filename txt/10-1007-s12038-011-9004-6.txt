to antibiotics,

i.e. 36.4% were resistant

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses a serious problem in dairy animals suffering from
mastitis. In the present study, the distribution of mastitic MRSA and antibiotic resistance was studied in 107 strains of
S. aureus isolated from milk samples from 195 infected udders. The characterizations pathogenic factors (adhesin and
toxin genes) and antibiotic susceptibility of isolates were carried out using gene amplification and disc diffusion
assays, respectively. A high prevalence of MRSA was observed in the tested isolates (13.1%). The isolates were also
highly resistant
to streptomycin, 33.6% to oxytetracycline, 29.9% to
gentamicin and 26.2% each to chloramphenicol, pristinomycin and ciprofloxacin. A significant variation in the
expression of pathogenic factors (Ig, coa and clf) was observed in these isolates. The overall distribution of adhesin
genes ebp, fib, bbp, fnbB, cap5, cap8, map and cna in the isolates was found to be 69.1, 67.2, 6.5, 20.5, 60.7, 26.1,
81.3 and 8.4%, respectively. The presence of fib, fnbB, bbp and map genes was considerably greater in MRSA than
in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates. The proportions of toxin genes, namely, hlb, seb, sec, sed, seg
and sei, in the isolates were found to be 94.3, 0.9, 8.4, 0.9, 10.2 and 49.5%, respectively. The proportions of agr
genes I, II, III and IV were found to be 39.2, 27.1, 21.5 and 12.1%, respectively. A few isolates showed similar
antibiotic-resistance patterns, which could be due to identical strains or the dissemination of the same strains among
animals. These findings can be utilized in mastitis treatment programmes and antimicrobials strategies in organized
herds.

Introduction

is associated with
Mastitis is an infectious disease that
massive financial
losses in the dairy sector. Among the
various causative agents, Staphylococcus aureus is one of
the most prevalent and contagious pathogens of intra-
mammary infections in dairy cattle globally. The evolution
of antibiotic resistance in S. aureus strains is a serious cause
of concern in dairy animals (Wang et al. 2008). Strains of S.
to β-lactam antibiotics are known as
aureus resistant
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). These strains in
intra-mammary dissemination often produce incurable se-

vere intra-herd infections (Moon et al. 2007; Kumar et al.
2010). MRSA strains have been observed to be multi-drug
resistant, such as aminoglycosides, macrolides,
lincosa-
mides, streptogramins, tetracyclines, etc., which are often
used in the treatment of mastitis (Wang et al. 2008; Kumar
et al. 2010). The transmission of bovine MRSA to humans
is possible and may contribute to outbreaks in animal and
human populations (Lee 2003). Hence, it is necessary to
know which endemic strains of S. aureus in dairy cattle
populations are highly pathogenic and methicillin-resistant.
MRSA strains show pathogenic and epidemiological
characteristics in various ways such as mutation, clonal

evolution (Fitzgerald et al. 2001) and horizontal gene
transfer (Brody et al. 2008). These evolutionary processes
enhance the pathogenic and antimicrobial-resistant proper-
ties of S. aureus strains. However, a limited diversity of
S. aureus strains or clones cause most of the mastitic
infections in each geographical region, as these isolates are
better adapted to infect animals (Annemüller et al. 1999;
Salasia et al. 2004; El-Sayed et al. 2006; Moon
et al. 2007). Various molecular
techniques have been
explored and used to analyse the pathogenesis and distribu-
tion of pathogenic genes in strains of S. aureus (Fitzgerald
et al. 2001; Peacock et al. 2002; Løvseth et al. 2004).
Identification and early elimination of pathogenic MRSA
strains at the herd level is possible by the use of different
molecular microbiology tools. The available information is
limited regarding the genetic heterogeneity of MRSA strains
in mastitic cattle under subtropical conditions i.e. in the
Indian environment. The present investigation was carried
out with the objective to determine the distribution of
MRSA genetic variants of S. aureus isolates from mastitic
cattle in a closed herd located in northwest India.

2. Materials and methods

2.1

Identification and biochemical characterization

Milk samples (195) from animals of the Sahiwal herd
suffering from mastitis were screened using the California
mastitis test. The isolation of S. aureus stains was carried
out using the standard method (Kumar et al. 2010). Briefly,
an aliquot of 100 μl of aseptically collected milk samples
from each infected animal was spread over a Baird Parker
agar plate and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. After incubation,
colonies were selected and subjected to Gram staining,
catalase test and morphological identification. The Gram-
and catalase-positive cocci were characterized for carbo-
hydrates fermentation (Hicarbohydrate™ kit containing
34 different carbohydrate; Himedia, India), which was
followed by urease, ortho-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside
(ONPG), Vogues-Proskauer, arginine utilization, lysostaphin
sensitivity, coagulase, clumping factor, thermonuclease, hae-
molysin, capsule, bio-film and slime production tests as
explained by Kumar et al. (2010).

sterile saline water equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard.
The suspension (100 μl) was spread over the medium
plate. Then, the antibiotic disk was transferred aseptically
on to the surface of
the inoculated medium, and
methicillin was incubated further at 30°C, and other
antibiotics at 35°C, for a period of 24 h. Staphylococcus
aureus ATCC 25923 and S. aureus NCDC 110 were used
as controls. The antibiotics and their concentrations used
are as follows: amikacin (30 μg), amoxicillin (10 μg),
amoxicillin-sulbactum (20 μg), amoxicillin-clavulanate
(20 μg), ampicillin (25 μg), cephalexin (30 μg), chloram-
(30 μg), ciprofloxacin (30 μg), clindamycin
phenicol
(10 μg), cloxacillin (30 μg), gentamicin (20 μg), kanamy-
cin (20 μg), cefixime (5 μg), lincomycin (15 μg), methi-
cillin (5, 10 and 15 μg), ofloxacin (5 μg), oxacillin (5 μg),
oxytetracycline (30 μg), penicillin-G (10 units), pristinomycin
(15 μg), rifampicin (20 μg), vancomycin (10 μg) and
streptomycin (20 μg).

2.3 Partial amplification of 16S rDNA, mecA

and nuc genes

Subsequent to biochemical characterizations, staphylococcal
isolates were further subjected to species-specific gene
amplification (16S rDNA). DNA from the isolates was
extracted as per procedure reported previously (Kumar et al.
2010).
Information about annealing temperatures and
oligonucleotide primers used is given in table 1. The
reaction mixture (25 μl) used for gene amplification
contained: 2 μl dNTPs (200 μm/μl), 2.5 μl of 10× Taq
buffer consisting of 15 mM MgCl2 (Banglore Genei, India),
1 μl each forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers
(10 pm/μl; Sigma Aldrich, USA), 0.35 μl Taq DNA
polymerase (3 U/μl; Banglore Genei, India), 1 μl DNA
(30 ng/μl) and 17.2 μl distilled water. The amplification
was carried out in 0.2 ml PCR tubes in thermal cycler
(Løvseth et al. 2004). Isolates were tested for the presence
of nuc (Brakstad et al. 1992) and mecA genes (Murakami
et al. 1991). Segments of mecA and nuc genes were
amplified using primers and annealing temperatures as
listed in table 1. The amplified products were imaged by
running them in 1.5% agarose containing 0.5 μg/ml
ethidium bromide.

2.2 Antibiotic susceptibility

2.4 PCR amplification of genes encoding putative

pathogenic factors

The antibiotic-susceptibility profile of isolates was prepared
using the disk diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar as
recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
(2008). In brief, S. aureus isolates were grown overnight on
blood agar at 37°C, and the colonies were suspended in

Identified S. aureus isolates were studied for putative
pathogenic factors (adhesins, enterotoxins,
toxic shock
syndrome toxin and exfoliative toxins). All the oligonucle-
otide primers used were selected from earlier reports as
mentioned in table 1. Amplifications of genes encoding the

[given in table] for 30 s and elongation for 1 min at 72°C) terminated with a 5 min incubation step at 72°C.

X-region of protein A (spa),
immunoglobulin-binding
region (Ig), clumping factor (clf), collagen-binding protein
(cna), capsular polysaccharide 5 and 8 (cap 5 and cap 8),
major histocompatibility complex class II analogue protein
(map), fibronectin-binding proteins A and B (fnbA and
fnbB), accessory gene regulator alleles (agr I-IV) and α- and
β-haemolysin (hla and hlb) were carried out using PCR.
Oligonucleotide primers and annealing temperatures used
for these genes are presented in table 1. The composition of
the reaction mixture was the same in all PCR amplifications
as explained for 16S rDNA gene.

The genes encoding elastin-binding protein (ebp), laminin-

J. Biosci. 36(1), March 2011

Antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity factors in S. aureus isolated from mastitic cattle

181

for significant association using SYSTAT 12. P-value≤0.05
was considered significant.

3. Results

3.1

Identification and biochemical characterization

Biochemical tests revealed 107 isolates of S. aureus. All
these isolates were positive (100.0%) for catalase, bio-films
and the presence of capsules. The isolates that were also
positive for urease,
the Vogues-Proskauer test, arginine
hydrolysis, lysostaphin sensitivity, clumping factor, DNase,
coagulase, β-haemolysin, α-haemolysin, slime production
and TNase were in the proportions of 98.1, 63.5, 59.8, 96.2,
90.6, 86.9, 78.5, 77.5, 22.4, 65.4 and 57.0%, respectively.

3.2 Antibiotic susceptibility

Antibiotic-susceptibility assays revealed that, among the
107 isolates, 34 were susceptible to all the antibiotics used
in this study. All the isolates (100.0%) were also susceptible
to vancomycin. Higher resistance was observed to strepto-
mycin (36.4% of the isolates), oxytetracycline (33.6%)
gentamicin and ampicillin (29.9%), penicillin-G (28.9%),
chloramphenicol, pristinomycin, ciprofloxacin (26.2%
each), and rifampicin and lincomycin (25.2% each).
However, some isolates were highly susceptible to cepha-
lexin (84.1%), amoxicillin-clavulanate, ofloxacin and clin-
damycin (81.3%). Fourteen isolates were found to be
methicillin-resistant, while the remaining (93) were
methicillin-susceptible. Of the 14 MRSA isolates, only 10
were resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate. The majority of
the MRSA isolates showed resistance to cloxacillin,
penicillin-G, chloramphenicol and rifampicin (table 2).
MSSA isolates were also resistant to streptomycin (30.1%
of
followed by oxytetracycline (26.9%),
gentamicin (22.6%) and amikacin (21.5%), and they were
also highly susceptible to cephalexin (92.5%), ofloxacin
(90.3%), amoxicillin-clavulanate and clindamycin (89.2%).
MRSA isolates were significantly (P<0.05) more resistant
to different antibiotics than MSSA isolates. Statistical
analysis revealed that the association between the antibiotics
was highly significant (P<0.01).

the isolates),

3.3 Detection of 16S rDNA, mecA and nuc genes

The partial amplification of specific 16S rDNA confirmed
that all the 107 isolates belonged to S. aureus and were also
positive for the nuc gene. Of the 14 methicillin-resistant
isolates, only 10 gave the band for mecA gene.

3.4 Molecular characterization for pathogenic factors

Molecular characterization revealed that
the recovered
isolates were positive for fnbA, hla, eno, spa, and Ig-
binding genes (table 3). Amplification of the spa gene
(X-region) showed seven amplicons of 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and
11 repeats (R). The most frequent number of repeats was
eight (in 57.9% of the isolates) followed by seven (17.7%)
and nine (15.8%). Polymorphic band patterns were also
observed in Ig-binding (figure 1) and clf genes. The sizes of
the amplicons for Ig-binding genes were 500 (in 14.9% of
the isolates), 1000 (55.1%) and 1100 bp (29.9%) and for clf,
950 (3.7%), 1000 (70.0%) and 1100 bp (20.5%). All the
isolates with more than 7R were found to express a
large number of pathogenic factors when compared
with other categories (table 4). Isolates with 3R, 4R, 7R,
8R, 9R, 10R and 11R were positive (100.0%) with four
(eno, fnbA, cap8 and map), three (eno, fnbA and cap5),
two (eno and fnbA), two (eno and fnbA), two (eno and
fnbA), five (eno, ebp, fib, fnbA and map) and four (eno,
fnbA, cap8 and map) genes, respectively. In addition,
isolates consisting 3R, 9R, 10R and 11R were not positive
for two (bbp and cap5), one (bbp), two (cap8 and cna)
and five (ebp, bbp, fnbB, cap5 and cna) genes, respec-
tively. The details of spa repeats and associations with
different genes are presented in table 4. The majority of
MRSA isolates revealed more than seven repeats in the
spa gene (table 3).

The isolates were positive in high proportion for ebp, eno
and fib as compared with those for bbp (table 3; figure 2).
The distribution of accessory gene regulators I, II, III and IV
in isolated bacterial strains was found to be 39.2, 27.1, 21.5
and 12.1%, respectively. The occurrence of pathogenic
genes between MRSA and MSSA isolates was uneven
(table 3). The percentage-wise distribution of pathogenic
genes cap8 (42.9, 23.7), fnbB (28.6, 19.4), map (85.7, 80.6)
and coa (100.0, 88.2) was greater in MRSA than in MSSA
isolates. However, the occurrence of bbp (0.0, 7.5), ebp
(64.3, 69.9), fib (50.0, 69.9), clf (92.9, 94.6), cna (8.6, 7.1)
and cap5 (50.0, 62.4) genes was slightly lower in MRSA
than in MSSA isolates. Table 5 shows that the antibiotic
resistance was high in isolates that had the hlb, ebp, fib
and map genes; whereas the proportion was less in
isolates showing the presence of cna,
fnbB and bbp
genes. The overall presence of capsular genes (cap5 and
cap8)
in isolates was significantly associated with
antibiotic resistance. However, category-wise antibiotic-
resistance differences in isolates with cap5 and cap8 were
non-significant (table 5). The presence of genes, namely,
fnbA, eno, hla and nuc, did not show any relation to
antibiotic resistance, because all the tested isolates were
positive for these genetic determinants.

isolates). The enterotoxin sei was the most frequent among
these isolates (42.9%). All the isolates lacked amplification
of sea, see, seh, sej, tsst-1, eta and etb genes (table 3).
Statistical analysis for association was found to be signif-
icant (P<0.05) between fnbB and cna, hlb and map, ebp and
cap5, hlb and ebp, clf and hlb, hlb and coa, fib and coa, ebp
and sei, fib and sei, sei and mecA, and cna and seg/sei.

3.5 PCR-RFLP of coagulase gene

The amplicons digested with Hae III generated six different
RFLP patterns (A–F) as shown in figure 4. The number of
fragments produced during digestion varied in size (50 to
850 bp). The RFLP patterns A and D (both account for
66.3%) dominated within the isolated population (table 3).
The isolates with RFLP pattern F showed susceptibility for
methicillin, penicillin-G, oxacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate,
amoxicillin, cloxacillin,
lincomycin, pristinomycin and
cephalexin, while isolates revealing RFLP pattern E were
resistant to these antibiotics. The antibiotic-resistant isolates
showed RFLP patterns A (38.4% of the isolates), C (10.9%)
and D (35.6%). Statistical analysis showed that
the
association between coagulase and antibiotics, namely, amox-
icillin, clindamycin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline, amoxicillin-
clavulanate and ofloxacin was significant (P<0.05). The
patterns A, C and E were associated with the pathogenic
factors; whereas the B, E and F patterns were negative for the
factors (table 4).

4. Discussion

The present investigation on the distribution of MRSA,
putative pathogenic genes and antibiotic-resistance of S.
aureus isolates from mastitic cattle showed diverse
biochemical characteristics. Mastitic S. aureus strains
have been reported as expressing atypical characteristics
(Aarestrup et al. 1999). The distribution of α, β-haemolysin
and coagulase was in agreement with earlier
findings
(Aarestrup et al. 1999; Boerlin et al. 2003; Kumar et al.
2010). Identification of isolates was also confirmed by
molecular assay because biochemical tests sometimes give
false results or identities.

In the present study, the S. aureus isolates were typed for
antibiotic resistance to obtain vital information that could
help evolving a strategy for prevention and treatment of
mastitis in cattle. A large number of isolates were observed
to show resistance to multiple antibiotics (table 2). Appear-
ance of resistance against a particular antibiotic in a specific
region may be due to its frequent and long-term use (Sabour
et al. 2004; Moon et al. 2007; Kumar et al. 2010). The
results of the present study revealed that a significant
number of
isolates showed resistance to antibiotics
(penicillin-G, gentamicin, streptomycin, ampicillin, cipro-
floxacin, oxytetracycline, etc.) that are frequently used in
mastitic animals (table 2). The proportion of penicillin-G-
resistant isolates (29.0%) in this study was closer to those in

American herds (Erskine et al. 2002; Makovec and Ruegg
2003) than European herds (Vintov et al. 2003). The
occurrence of isolates resistant to streptomycin, lincomycin,
cloxacillin, ciprofloxacin, pristinomycin and clindamycin
(table 2) was less frequent than that observed by Wang et al.
(2008) in Chinese bovine herds. However, it was slightly
higher than that reported from India (Kumar et al. 2010),
Argentina (Gentilini et al. 2000), Europe and the United
States (De Oliveira et al. 2000). Such differences can be
attributed to diverse antibiotics administrated during mastitis
infection. There was a higher prevalence of MRSA (13.0%)
as compared with those in similar reports in the literature
(Lee 2003; Moon et al. 2007; Van den Eede et al. 2009;
Kumar et al. 2010). Among MRSA isolates, four showed
poor expression of mecA genes or production of methicilli-
nase (alteration of PBP subtypes) or seemed to be over-
producing β-lactamase, as these isolates remained
susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate (Moon et al. 2007;
Turutoglu et al. 2009; Kumar et al. 2010). Moreover, the
resistant proportion was higher in MRSA than in MSSA
isolates for various antibiotics, as the MRSA generally
express resistance to multiple drugs (Wang et al. 2008;
Kumar et al. 2010).

The molecular characterization of isolates also showed
variations in pathogenic genes. Polymorphic patterns in
protein A, Ig-binding, coagulase and clumping factor genes
revealed significant genetic heterogeneity among S. aureus

isolates. Genetic variations in pathogenic genes were found
in isolates of S. aureus in the herd studied, and similar
observations within a single herd have also been reported
earlier (Sabour et al. 2004). The variants of spa have been
used to discriminate epidemic and non-epidemic MRSA and
MSSA strains (Montesinos et al. 2002; Reinoso et al. 2008;
Kumar et al. 2010). In the present study, spa variants also
showed utility in distinguishing the isolates (table 4). Frag-
ments of different sizes in Ig and clf were observed, which
differed from those in earlier reports (Akineden et al. 2001;
Salasia et al. 2004; Reinoso et al. 2008). Coagulase
genotype differs with geographic area, and polymorphic
patterns have been reported to discriminate the pathogenic-
ity of strains of S. aureus (Phonimdaeng et al. 1990;
Annemüller et al. 1999; Montesinos et al. 2002; Moon et al.
2007; Kumar et al. 2010). In the present study, six different
RFLP patterns were observed, whereas in the study by
Montesinos et al. (2002) only four patterns were reported.
In addition, like the spa genes, Ig-binding, RFLP variants of
coagulase genes were quite useful
in distinguishing the

isolates on the basis of pathogenesis and antibiotic resis-
tance (tables 2 and 4).

Adhesin genes of S. aureus play a significant role in
causing infection, colonization and invasion in the host
(Peacock et al. 2002). All the isolates studied were found to
be positive for hla, eno, fnbA and nuc genes expression.
Similar observations have been reported for their significant
role in S. aureus pathogenicity in cattle (Salasia et al. 2004;
El-Sayed et al. 2006). Binding of S. aureus to fibroblasts
and epithelial cells increase significantly with fib and map,
while ebp enhances binding with peptides and tropoelastin
(Palma et al. 1999; Zecconi et al. 2005). A significant
number of isolates were positive for ebp, fib and map genes
(table 3), and possibly these are essential for colonization and
pathogenesis in mastitis. In these observations, only seven S.
aureus isolates showed the bbp gene. Only a few isolates
revealed genetic determinants of fnbB and cna genes (table 3);
however,
their role in mastitis could not be established.
Earlier reports also did not show the influence of fnbB and
cna in bovine mammary gland infection (Lammers et al.

1999; Salasia et al. 2004; El-Sayed et al. 2006). Capsular
types 5 and 8 predominated in isolates, and these results are
in agreement with earlier studies (El-Sayed et al. 2006;
Reinoso et al. 2008). The findings are also comparable with
different forms of agr I to IV gene distribution as reported
earlier (Gilot and van Leeuwen 2004; Reinoso et al. 2008).
The relation of agr gene distribution to mastitic isolates still
remains unclear. Significant association of agr variants with
antibiotic resistance was not found in the present investiga-
tion (table 2).

The antibiotic-resistant isolates showed the presence of hlb,
ebp, fib and map. A few pathogenic factors (cna, fnbB, bbp)
were not significantly associated with the antibiotic resistance
or were less frequent. Conversely, the antibiotic-susceptible
isolates were also found to reveal these pathogenic factor
genes (table 5). The presence or absence of these genes
may have no relation to antibiotic-resistant or antibiotic-
susceptibile aspects. Genetic determinants of antibiotics
and pathogenic factors have not been reported to reside
on the same loci (Brody et al. 2008; Fournier 2008). The
expressions of pathogenic factors depend on the accessory
gene regulator (agr) and the staphylococcal accessory
regulator. The majority of antibiotic-resistant genes have
been shown on reside mobile plasmids (Brody et al. 2008;
Kumar et al. 2010). Capsular
formations have been
reported to contribute in pathogenesis in order to reduce
antibiotic susceptibility (Seaman et al. 2004). The obser-
vations in the present study revealed the presence of
capsular genes in both antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-
susceptible isolates. The association of antibiotics with agr

and coa has been reported in isolates (Moon et al. 2007).
The coagulase gene RFLP patterns (A, D and E) were
found to be significantly associated with antibiotic resis-
tance (table 2). Moreover,
the expression of some
pathogenic factors (nuc, fnbA and hla) did not show any
correlations with antibiotics, as all isolates were positive
for the presence of these genes. Similarly,
the uneven
presence of pathogenic factors in MRSA and MSSA
indicated non- significant correlation (table 3).

The isolates tested for super-antigen toxins showed
only enterotoxin genes (seb, sec, sed, seg and sei), and
sei was most frequently encountered in this study. Toxins
are supposed to modulate immune response through
super-antigen activity and give rise to various diseases
(Peacock et al. 2002). However, information is limited on
the role of staphylococcal toxins in mastitis pathogenic-
ity. Various enterotoxins, namely, sea, seb, sec, sed, see,
seh, seg, sei, sej and tsst-1, have been reported among the
S. aureus populations isolated from bovines (Akineden
et al. 2001; Stephan et al. 2001; Salasia et al. 2004;
Zschöck et al. 2004). All
the isolates tested failed to
amplify the tsst-1 gene, although its prevalence in bovine
isolates has been reported in association with sec and sed
(Akineden et al. 2001; Stephan et al. 2001; Salasia et al.
2004). Isolates also lacked the amplification eta and etb
genes. The occurrences of exfoliative toxins have been
rarely reported among S. aureus isolates from mastitic
cattle (Akineden et al. 2001; Salasia et al. 2004; El-Sayed
et al. 2006). Expression of
toxin genes varies with
location, and no specific reason has been reported

(Akineden et al. 2001; Stephan et al. 2001; Salasia
et al. 2004; Zschöck et al. 2004).

In conclusion, the present study generated information
on genotypic and antimicrobial
typing of MRSA and
MSSA isolates. The investigations revealed considerable
variations in the prevalence of different adhesin and toxin
genes among isolates. The unusual prevalence of bone-
sialoprotein-binding protein and the absence of
toxic
shock syndrome toxins showed atypical characteristics
of mastitic isolates. High prevalence of MRSA among
mastitic cases is another significant finding. The uneven
distribution of pathogenic factors between MRSA and
MSSA emphasized the fact that molecular characteriza-
tion is equally important in conjunction with antibiotic-
susceptibility tests in order to distinguish the isolates.
The prevalence of multiple-drug-resistant
isolates of
S. aureus among the mastitic cases needs special attention
for the eradication of such infection. These findings could
be useful in the treatment and segregation or culling in the
case of mastitic animals.
