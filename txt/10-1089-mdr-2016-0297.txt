This study provides an estimate of antimicrobial resistance in intestinal indicator bacteria from humans (n = 97)
and food animals (n = 388) in Tanzania. More than 70% of all fecal samples contained tetracycline (TE),
sulfamethoxazole (STX), and ampicillin (AMP)-resistant coliforms, while cefotaxime (CTX)-resistant coli-
forms were observed in 40% of all samples. The average Log10 colony forming units/g of CTX-resistant
coliforms in samples from humans were 2.20. Of 390 Escherichia coli tested, 66.4% were resistant to TE,
54.9% to STX, 54.9% to streptomycin, and 36.4% to CTX. Isolates were commonly (65.1%) multiresistant. All
CTX-resistant isolates contained blaCTX-M gene type. AMP- and vancomycin-resistant enterococci were rare,
and the average concentrations in positive samples were low (log10 0.9 and 0.4, respectively). A low-to-
moderate resistance (2.1–15%) was detected in 240 enterococci isolates to the drugs tested, except for ri-
fampicin resistance (75.2% of isolates). The average number of sulII gene copies varied between Log10 5.37
and 5.68 with no signiﬁcant difference between sample source, while cattle had signiﬁcantly higher number of
tetW genes than humans. These ﬁndings, based on randomly obtained samples, will be instrumental in designing
antimicrobial resistance (AMR) intervention strategies for Tanzania.

Introduction

A ntimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat to

treatment of bacterial diseases causing dramatically
increased healthcare costs due to hospitalization and expen-
sive drug choices.1 In sub-Saharan Africa, lack of enforce-
ment on the control of the sale and use of antibiotics has led
to widespread misuse of antimicrobials, both in human and
veterinary medicine. Thus, developing countries are increas-
ingly a source of new clones of resistant bacteria.2,3

Information on levels of resistance in bacteria from hu-
mans and food animal reservoirs forms the fundament for
risk management of AR. However, there is generally a
shortage of scientiﬁc data to demonstrate trends of AR in
animal or human populations in developing countries, and
there is an urgent need for systematic surveillance to com-
pensate for this lack of information.4

Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. are commonly
used as indicator bacteria to gauge the extent of AR in a
population.5,6 The potential of these organisms as indicators

of AR has been widely demonstrated in surveillance pro-
grams implemented in developed countries.7,8 Apart from
overall resistance measured in indicator bacteria, certain
important resistance phenotypes should be monitored clo-
sely, for example, E. coli producing extended spectrum b-
lactamases (ESBLs). The often multidrug-resistant ESBL
producers have emerged globally in the recent decade,
giving rise to substantial treatment challenges.9 The main
type of ESBL genes in both human and animal E. coli be-
longs to the cefotaxime (CTX)-M family.10 In Tanzania the
presence of ESBL has been studied in convenience samples
of bacteria from human patients,11–13 but in animals, the
prevalence is currently unknown.

Tanzania has a large livestock population, and most
production systems are extensive, characterized by a low
capital input and a low production level. Misuse of antibi-
otics is widespread mainly due to lack of knowledge on
health risks and a poorly controlled prescription system.14
So far, no systematic study of resistance level in random
samples from humans and food animals in Tanzania has

been conducted to establish baseline resistance levels in these
populations. Published studies have focused on ESBL pro-
ducing Enterobacteriaceae in humans in the community and
hospitals15 and in children below 2 years of age.16 Such
studies have not tried to relay the occurrence of resistant
bacteria in humans to the occurrence in food animals. In other
part of Africa, studies on ESBL bacteria have been carried
out in humans, including studies on the prevalence in adults,
children, and neonates in Ethiopia,17 children in Guinea-
Bissau,18 children in Bangui,19 and children in Gabon.20

Consequently, it is not possible from current studies to
estimate whether resistance levels are indeed out of control
as could be inferred from some publications,2,3 and it is also
not possible to estimate the public health risks that humans
can encounter by sharing the same environment with ani-
mals, handling animals, animal wastes, or consuming an-
imal products in these countries. Therefore, the aim of this
study was to estimate the extent of AR in intestinal indicator
bacteria in randomly collected fecal samples from humans
and selected food animals in Tanzania.

Materials and Methods

Sample sources and sampling

Samples were collected from two regions, Morogoro and
Dar-Es-salaam, in Tanzania. The two regions were pur-
posely selected because livestock keeping is intense due to
urban and peri-urban market demand of livestock products.
In each region a district (Morogoro and Kinondoni, re-
spectively) was selected for sampling, and from each of
these districts ﬁve wards were randomly selected as the
sampling areas.

Freshly voided fecal materials (3–5 g) were collected in
2011–2013 from randomly picked commercial pigs (n = 97),
dairy (n = 97), beef (n = 40) cattle, and chicken farms
(n = 97). One animal was sampled per farm. In addition,
indigenous chickens, which are widespread over a large
geographical area in Tanzania and kept in extensive free-
range systems, were sampled from nonpurposely identiﬁed
households (n = 97). In addition, 5–10 g of fecal samples
were collected from humans (n = 97) who were epidemio-
logically independent from each other. After collection,
samples were stored in sterile containers at *4°C during
transportation to the laboratory, where processing for bac-
teriological analyses was carried out immediately.

Enumeration of antibiotic-resistant indicator bacteria

Quantiﬁcation of coliforms and Enterococcus spp. in fe-
ces was performed as previously described.21 Brieﬂy, 10-
fold dilutions of fecal material were plated on MacConkey
agar (Oxoid, Basingstoke, United Kingdom) plates without
antibiotics and on plates with 2 mg/L CTX or 16 mg/L tet-
racycline (TE) or 16 mg/L ampicillin (AMP) or 256 mg/L
sulfamethoxazole (STX), as well as on Slanetz–Bartley agar
plates (Oxoid) without antibiotics and plates with 16 mg/L
AMP or 16 mg/L vancomycin (VA). Concentrations of an-
tibiotics were chosen to obtain a good separation between
resistant and sensitive isolates based on wild-type minimum
inhibitory concentration distributions for Enterobacteriaceae
faecium in EUCAST, as previously described.21
and E.
Following overnight (coliforms) or 48 h (enterococci) in-

cubation at 37°C,
typical colonies were counted, and
weighted average of colony forming units (CFU)/g of feces
was determined. For statistical analysis of average CFU, a
value of 1 CFU/g was given to samples with a concentration
below the detection level.

Bacterial species identiﬁcation

Presumptive E. coli from MacConkey agar plates were
conﬁrmed to species level using Gram stain and the IMViC
phenotypic tests (indole, methyl red, Voges Proskauer, and
citrate) as previously described.22 Species identity of pre-
sumptive Enterococcus spp. colonies was determined by
multiplex PCR.23 Matrix assisted laser desorption ioniza-
tion–time of ﬂight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)
(VITEK MS RUO; bioMe´rieux, France) was further used to
identify presumptive non E. coli coliforms showing an
ESBL phenotype and to identify E. coli and Enterococcus
spp. isolates that did not show typical reactions by bio-
chemical characterization or by multiplex PCR.

Antibiotic sensitivity testing

The disc diffusion method was used to determine phe-
notypic resistance in randomly picked, puriﬁed, and spe-
ciated isolates of E. coli from MacConkey agar and
Enterococcus spp.
isolates from Slanetz–Bartley plates
without antibiotics, according to Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI)24 guidelines, as previously de-
scribed.15 The following discs were used (E. coli): 5:1 STX
(25 mg), AMP (10 mg), amoxicillin–clavulanic acid 2:1
(30 mg), gentamicin (CN, 10 mg), TE (30 mg), ciproﬂoxacin
(CIP, 5 mg), streptomycin (10 mg), CTX (30 mg), and En-
terococcus spp.: VA (30 mg), erythromycin (15 mg), CIP
(5 mg), AMP (10 mg), chloramphenicol (30 mg), rifampicin
(RD, 5 mg), CN (120 mg), and TE (30 mg). The reference
strains E. coli ATCC 25922 and Enterococcus faecalis
ATCC 29212 were used for quality control.

The results were interpreted as Resistant, Intermediate,
and Susceptible as indicated in the CLSI guidelines.24 In this
study multiple resistances were deﬁned as a single bacte-
rium being resisted three and more antimicrobials.25

Detection of ESBL phenotype and blaCTX-M in putative
ESBL-producing bacteria

Colonies of E. coli, as well as lactose negative colonies,
growing on MacConkey plates with added CTX were tested
for synergy between CTX and clavulanic acid according to
Lewis et al.,26 and presence/absence of blaCTXM was de-
termined by PCR method according to Hasman et al.27 E.
coli ATCC strain 25922 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC
strain 700603 (HiMedia, Mumbai, India) were used as
negative and positive controls for ESBL production test,
respectively.28

Quantiﬁcation of sulII and tetW genes in fecal samples

Gene copy numbers of sulII and tetW genes, as 16s RNA
gene copies, were determined to estimate general levels of
AR genes by a culture independent method. Details on DNA
puriﬁcation,
the qPCR reactions, generation of standard
curves, quality control of the performance of the qPCR re-
actions, and the primer sequences can be seen in Katakweba

et al.21 The prediction interval of the number of amplicons
was calculated using the formulas developed by Danzer
and Currie.29

Statistical analysis

Statistical differences in mean – standard error of the
mean Log10 CFU/g feces and in Log10 number of sulII and
tetW genes by qPCR were analyzed using one-way analysis
of variance followed by Duncan’s multiple range test.
Binary logistic regression models (SPSS; version 16.0) and
GraphPad Prism version 6.0 (GraphPad Software, San
Diego, CA) were used for the analysis of qualitative sus-
ceptibility data from disk diffusion test by chi-square and
Fisher’s exact test.

Ethical clearance

Ethical approval was obtained from National Institute for
Medical Research of Tanzania (NIMR)
(reference no.
NIMR/HQ/R.8a/Vol.IX/936 to the ﬁrst author), and fecal
samples were obtained from humans with written consent
from the participants.

Results

Bacterial isolates picked for detailed characterization

In the current study, estimation of resistance levels was
based on counting of bacteria growing on selective agar
media with and without added antimicrobials and on char-
acterization of puriﬁed and speciated bacteria. With regard
to the latter, all lactose positive >0.5 mm colonies from
MacConkey agar were shown to E. coli. Fifty-nine non-
lactose fermenters were picked, because they were observed
to grow on MacConkey agar plates containing CTX. These
were identiﬁed by MALDI-TOF MS to be Klebsiella
pneumonia (n = 49), Ochrobactrum spp. (n = 3), Achromo-
bacter spp. (n = 1), and lactose negative E. coli (n = 3). Three
isolates remained unidentiﬁed. A random subset of 164
presumptive Enterococcus colonies from Slanetz–Bartley
agar was characterized. The species distribution according
to origin of the sample is shown in Table 1. The majority of

isolates from all animal species and humans were E. faecium
(92%) followed by E. hirae and E. faecalis.

Quantiﬁcation of resistant bacteria in fecal samples
from humans and food animals

The number of antimicrobial resistant coliforms in fecal
samples was presented as Log10 CFU/g, as well as the
proportion of samples that showed growth over the detection
limit. Table 2 shows results obtained when quantifying co-
liform bacteria.

More than 70% of all samples contained coliforms that
were resistant to TE, STX, or AMP, and coliforms that were
resistant to CTX were observed in 40% of all samples.
Signiﬁcantly higher numbers of samples were positive with
resistant colonies among dairy cattle compared with beef
cattle, irrespective of antimicrobial agents. The total number
of coliforms per gram feces was between Log10 4.0 and
log10 5.1. The observed number of bacteria was signiﬁcantly
lower in beef cattle than in other animals and in humans
(Table 2). With the exception of beef cattle, CTX-resistant
coliforms were observed in >30% of samples of all species,
however, with relatively low numbers per animal. On av-
erage, CFU of CTX-resistant coliforms in samples from
positive humans were 2.2 Log10 CFU/g (Table 2); however,
up to 7.12 Log10 CFU/g were detected in individual samples
(data not shown).

As shown in Table 2, the total number of enterococci
from beef cattle was low compared to other animal species.
AMP and VA-resistant enterococci were detected in sam-
ples from humans and all animal species, although with low
frequency (16% of human and 5.3% of all samples, re-
spectively) (Table 2). In samples, counts of AMP resistant
colonies ranged from 2.80 to 6.95 Log10 CFU/g, and counts
of VA-resistant enterococci ranged between 3.75 and 6.34
Log10 CFU/g.

When the number of resistant bacteria was expressed
relative to total number of coliform bacteria and En-
terococcus spp. (Log10 resistant colonies/Log10 total number
of colonies), it was generally found that beef cattle had
signiﬁcantly lower proportion of resistant bacteria compared
to other sample sources (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2;
Supplementary Data are available online at www.liebertpub
.com/mdr). Furthermore, all samples from other sources
than beef cattle had high proportions of AMP-, STX-, and
TE-resistant coliforms. The highest proportions of AMP-
resistant Enterococcus spp. were observed among humans
and indigenous chicken, while the highest proportion of VA-
resistant enterococci was observed in samples from pigs.

Phenotypic resistance in single isolates
of indicator bacteria

Isolates for characterization of resistance by disc diffu-
sion were obtained from MacConkey and Slanetz–Bartley
agar without antibiotics, and results for E. coli are listed in
Table 3. The prevalence of E. coli resistant to TE, STX, and
AMP was high (68.8%, 61.1%, and 54.8%). Resistance to
CTX was demonstrated in 36.4% of all isolates, with more
than 50% of the isolates from dairy cattle showing this re-
sistance. As above, there was a large difference between
beef and dairy cattle. CIP resistance was by far most
widespread among chicken isolates (>50%).

KATAKWEBA ET AL.

Isolates of enterococci showed high levels of resistance
toward RD (75.2%) and a much lower level of resistance to
E (15%) and TE (13.8%). Resistance toward CN (120 mg)
was not observed. Notably, Vancomycin-Resistant Ente-
rococci (VRE) were present in humans, pigs, dairy cattle,
and chickens, and AMP resistance was observed at high
levels in cattle isolates (Table 4).

Numbers of multiresistant E. coli and enterococci

Among the E. coli isolates, multiresistance was observed
in 254 (65.1%) of the isolates tested. The number of dif-
ferent resistances in strains obtained from different hosts is
shown in Supplementary Table S3. Two isolates showed
resistance to all eight antimicrobials tested. For Entero-
coccus spp., multiresistance was observed in 18 (7.5%) of
all the tested isolates. The maximum resistance was ob-
served up to four antimicrobials. The number of resistances
observed per strain is shown in Supplementary Table S4.

Detection of blaCTX-M genes in presumptive
ESBL isolates

Escherichia coli showing resistance to CTX and lactose
negative colonies growing on MacConkey agar with CTX
were analyzed, and all these showed synergy when cefo-
taxime and clavulanic acid were tested together (>5 mm
increase in zone diameters). Further they were all positive
for blaCTX-M by PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Quantiﬁcation of sulII and tet(W) genes by qPCR

The highest numbers of sulII gene copies were observed
in cattle (Log10 5.68) and the lowest in pigs (Log10 5.37),
but there were no signiﬁcant ( p > 0.05) differences between
sample sources (Table 5). For tetW genes, there was a sig-
niﬁcant difference in sample sources, and cattle had highest
gene copy number (Log10 7.39), while the lowest num-
ber was observed in humans (Log10 6.41). 16s rDNA copy
numbers were signiﬁcantly different between sample sour-
ces, indicating that the total numbers of bacteria per gram
feces were different between species. When expressed rel-
atively to 16s rRNA gene copies, only cattle was signiﬁ-
cantly different from the other animals/humans with regard
to both genes analyzed.

Discussion

Three different techniques were used in this study for
assessment of the general levels of resistance in randomly
collected fecal samples from humans and food animals in
Tanzania. Two of the methods were linked, since they were
both based on bacteria growing on selective media, while
the third qPCR assessed resistance levels by a growth in-
dependent method. A recent study, which quantiﬁed gene
copies of 14 antimicrobial resistance-genes by qPCR and
compared gene number of resistance genes to Log10 CFU
coliform with phenotypic resistance in pig feces, concluded
that the two measurements had no statistical association.
However, qPCR was shown to give a good representation
for the general resistance level and was less inﬂuenced by
sample bias.30 Thus our approach assured that results ob-
tained would reveal differences between the various hosts
based on biologically different indicator systems. This must

pointed out by others.31–33

Apart from studies focusing on the contamination of an-
imal products like meat and milk,34,35 there are no data in
Tanzania reporting on number of coliforms and enterococci

and their AR proﬁles from food animals. The present study
showed that beef cattle contained lower number resistant
coliforms and enterococci than dairy cattle, pigs, and in-
tensively kept exotic chickens, as well as local chickens.
These ﬁndings corroborate those of Hershberger et al.,36

used for treatments,37,38 and we presume that treatment of
this disease is a main driver of resistance level in dairy cows
in Tanzania.

It was unexpected that the numbers of resistant coliforms
and enterococci in local chickens were higher than in inten-
sively kept exotic chickens, since local chickens are kept in
extensive way, left to scavenge for food in villages. Such birds
are rarely treated with antimicrobials.14 It is possible that these
results are because of exposure to compounded feed and an-
timicrobials used in other livestock, but it may also be a result
of the low hygiene in villages in Tanzania. Birds may come
into contact with human feces while scavenging for food and,
thus, be colonized with resistant bacteria from humans.

Cephalosporin drugs are not widely available for veteri-
nary use and are rarely used in small scale in farms in
Tanzania.14 Surprisingly, the present study showed wide-
spread occurrence of resistance to cephalosporins in coli-
forms and E. coli from farm animals. In the isolates that
were characterized by PCR, this was found to be due to
presence of ESBL of the blaCTX-M-type. This can either be
due to co-selection of ESBLs by other antimicrobials used13
or it can indicate spread of bacteria from humans, where
there is widespread use of cephalosporin. The most likely
transmission direction for resistant bacteria in developed
countries is believed to be from animals to man. Our results
indicate that this may be different in extensive production
systems in poor countries. Whether this is associated to poor
sanitary conditions in rural areas, exposing animals to fecal
contamination from humans39,40 or drug residues in feed and
the environment, remains to be investigated.

A survey on veterinary antimicrobials use in Tanzania
found that TE, AMP, and sulfonamides were the most
commonly used drugs in farm animals.14 In the present
study resistance to these drugs was predominant in E. coli
isolates from cattle, pigs, and chickens. These drugs are
commonly used in livestock production in Sub-Saharan
Africa,41,43 and resistant bacteria with these resistances are
also seen outside Tanzania.42 The results further showed
that multiple resistance is common among E. coli, but less
so in enterococci, from animals and humans in Tanzania.

The ﬁnding with regard to enterococci is in contrast with
those of Byarugaba et al.44 who reported that 35 and 46

percent of enterococci spp. and E. coli from food of animal
origin in Uganda were resistant to ﬁve or more antimicrobials.
Also Tellevik et al.,16 reported high prevalence of multidrug
resistance (94%) among E. coli and K. pneumonia from
children in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Compared to ﬁndings by
EFSA,8 levels of AR in coliform indicator bacteria from an-
imals and humans in Tanzania are higher than in the European
countries with intensive livestock production systems. There
are currently no reliable data on antimicrobial consumption in
livestock in Tanzania, but the data on resistance levels may
indicate that consumption of some antimicrobials is high.

Resistance levels in Enterococcus spp. from Tanzania were
comparable or lower than those reported from Europe,8,45 with
the exception of the high levels of resistance to RD. This drug is
only used for humans in Tanzania, and these results, too, may
suggest transfer of bacteria from humans to animals, for example,
through environmental contamination. However, with the cur-
rent situation in developing countries, where use of antimicro-
bials is not stringently controlled, the use of human drugs to treat
animal diseases is also a possibility.46,47 Resistance to VA con-
tinued to be detected, although at very low levels in enterococcal
isolates from animals in Europe.8

Avoparcin, a glycopeptide showing cross-resistance to
medically important glycopeptides, has been used in the
European Community as a growth promoter in animal feeds,
and this has been documented to select VRE in studies using
molecular analysis of isolates of E. faecium.48,49 This growth
promoter has not been used in Tanzania. It was therefore
surprising to ﬁnd VRE among isolates obtained from animal
species. The VRE in human-associated samples may be a
result of VA use in hospitals,50 and it is recommended to
analyze more in detail for the presence of VRE in the human
population in Tanzania, as resistance seen in this study im-
plies an uncontrolled presence of VRE in the population.

ESBL producing bacteria constitute a particularly threat-
ening human health problem, for which a food animal source
may be present.51,52 The current study presents the ﬁrst report
on the presence of ESBL in Tanzania from food animals. The
CTX-M type is currently the most widespread and threatening
ESBL, particularly in community-acquired infections.53,54 E.
coli and K. pneumoniae were found to be the most common
carriers of ESBL genes. These species were also dominant
ESBL producers among patients attending a tertiary hospital in
northern Tanzania.13 ESBL producing bacteria have been also
reported in studies from Uganda,55 East Africa in general,56
and Central Africa.57 In the current study, a blaCTX-M PCR

method was used, and no further subdivision was attempted.
We cannot rule out that some of the isolates may carry addi-
tional ESBL genes, as it has been reported that several genes
can be present in the same bacteria.58 Mshana et al.15 have
previously reported the presence of blaCTX-M-15 in Tanzania.
The gene was found mostly to be located on transferrable
IncY and IncF plasmids, suggesting a high possibility for
transfer.

Tellevik et al.16 studied the prevalence of ESBL bacteria,
showing a higher prevalence among hospitalized (50.4%)
than community children (11.6%). Apart from detecting the
blaCTX-M-15 gene,
this study reported the presence of
plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase CMY-2 in Tanza-
nia. Over and above, ESBL prevalence was signiﬁcantly
higher among HIV positive (89.7%) than HIV negative
(16.9%) children. A review on ESBL in East African hos-
pitals published by Sonda et al.,59 reported CTX-M, TEM,
CTX-M-15, CMY-2, AmpC, and OXA-48 as the most fre-
quent ESBL genes, while KPC and NDM were infrequent.
Regular surveillances are needed in different countries to aid
in understanding of the epidemiology of these genes, and in
relation to the current study, it would be relevant to include
surveillance for genes encoding resistance to aztreonam and
carbapenemases, as well as colistin.

The choice of genes to be included in the culture indepen-
dent approach was justiﬁed by two factors. The sulII is the
most common gene encoding sulfonamide resistance in E.
coli,60 and tetW is a ribosomal protection type of TE resistance
genes,61 which is the most common TE resistance gene in
human fecal samples.62 Furthermore, STX and TE were the
most commonly used antimicrobials in the study area,14 hence
the possibility of detecting these genes was high. Surprisingly,
the differences seen by characterization of coliforms and by
disc diffusion, that is, that humans generally carried the highest
levels of resistance could not be conﬁrmed by this approach. In
this study, only cattle were different from the other groups,
and only with respect to copy numbers of tetW. This result
conﬁrms previous observation that culture dependent and
culture independent characterization of resistance levels
do not have statistical signiﬁcant agreement,30 and further
studies are needed to understand how to interpret ﬂuctu-
ations in AMR gene pools, as determined by culture in-
dependent approaches.

In conclusion, this article has quantiﬁed the levels of re-
sistance in commensal coliforms, E. coli and enterococci,
from healthy animals and humans in Tanzania. It has shown
that resistance level for several antimicrobials was higher in
isolates from humans than from food animals and also that
resistance levels in coliforms from food animals were higher
than those reported from Europe; especially resistance to TE,
sulfonamides, and AMP resistance, the most common human
and veterinary antimicrobials in Tanzania,60 was high. The
antimicrobial susceptibility data from especially enterococci
indicated that humans may be a possible source of AR bac-
teria in animals. The study reports for the ﬁrst time preva-
lence of ESBL bacteria in food animals in Tanzania, and it
documents the presence of VRE in these animals. Despite its
exploring nature, the study provides new insights into AR,
and it points to a need for further research into the dynamics
of transmission of AR among animals, people, and envi-
ronment. Further studies are also recommended to explore
pathways of sharing bacteria between human and animals.
