  ABSTRACT 

  The aim of the study was to investigate the preva-
lence,  distribution,  and  diversity  of  Escherichia  coli
in  goat-milk-powder  plants  in  Shaanxi,  China.  Three 
plants  manufacturing  goat  milk  powder  in  Shaanxi 
province  were  visited  once  for  sampling  during  2012 
and 2013. Samples were taken for isolation of E. coli.
Isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibil-
ity testing and detection of virulence genes. All isolates 
were  further  examined  by  pulsed-field  gel  electropho-
resis analysis. In total, 53 E. coli strains were isolated 
from 32 positive samples out of 534 samples. Among E. 
coli  isolates,  resistance  was  most  frequently  observed 
to  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  (75.5%),  whereas 
all  isolates  were  sensitive  to  gatifloxacin,  kanamycin, 
amikacin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. The 6 virulence 
genes of pathogenic E. coli were not detected. Pulsed-
field  gel  electrophoresis  results  showed  that  E.  coli
strains in plants were genetically diverse and milk stor-
age tank could be an important contamination source. 
This study could provide useful information for plants 
manufacturing  goat  milk  powder  to  establish  proper 
management  practices  that  help  minimize  the  chance 
of microbial contamination. 

  INTRODUCTION 

  Goat milk accounted for about 2.3% of the worldwide 
milk production (Claeys et al., 2014). Goat farming is 
of vital importance for the national economy in many 
countries in the Mediterranean and Middle East region 
and  is  particularly  well  organized  in  France,  Italy, 
Spain, and Greece (Park et al., 2007). Among the Eu-

ropean countries, Greece has the largest goat popula-
tion  (6,000,000  animals)  and  produces  about  450,000 
t of goat milk per year (Anifantakis, 2001). Goat milk 
and its products have 3 significant benefits in human 
nutrition: (1) feeding more starving and malnourished 
people in the developing world than cow milk; (2) serv-
ing people afflicted with cow-milk allergies and gastro-
intestinal  disorders,  which  is  a  significant  segment  in 
many populations of developed countries; and (3) meet-
ing  the  gastronomic  needs  of  connoisseur  consumers, 
which has a growing market share in many developed 
countries. 

Escherichia  coli  in  raw  milk  is  inactivated  by  pas-
teurization but may enter dairy powder after process-
ing,  such  as  during  the  drying  process  (IDF,  1991). 
Escherichia coli is regarded by the dairy industry as an 
important indicator of manufacturing hygiene, and this 
group, or the coliform subgroup, is widely included in 
microbial specifications or guidelines for dairy powders 
in various countries. Pathogenic E. coli in improperly 
pasteurized milk has caused foodborne outbreaks, and 
antimicrobial  resistance  of  E.  coli  is  another  concern 
of the public. It was shown that when considering 60 
outbreaks and 4 single cases described in the literature 
and implicating milk and milk products, pathogenic E. 
coli  were  responsible  for  11  outbreaks  (De  Buyser  et 
al.,  2001).  In  2009,  a  study  revealed  the  presence  of 
pathogenic E. coli in dairy powder factory environments 
(Duffy et al., 2009). A study from Ireland showed that 
the occurrence of the virulence gene of E. coli in raw 
milk was 36.0%, whereas the occurrence of isolates was 
0.8% (Lynch et al., 2012). 

  

  Owing to the unique properties of goat milk, it has 
been widely consumed in some regions of the world and 
by a considerable portion of the population. And, goat 
milk-based infant formula is becoming more and more 
preferred by consumers. However, there is a paucity of 
data regarding E. coli contamination in goat milk and 
plants, except a study on the E. coli in dairy powder 
factory environments (Duffy et al., 2009). The objec-
tive of this study was to determine the prevalence of 
E. coli strains in goat milk powder in the year of 2012 
and  2013  from  4  plants  in  Shaanxi  province,  China,

and characterize these strains by antimicrobial suscep-
tibility  testing  and  toxin-gene  detection.  In  addition, 
pulsed-field  gel  electrophoresis  (PFGE)  profiles  of 
isolates were compared to identify the possible source 
of contamination at different stages and sampling sites 
of the processing line.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sampling Design and Collection

Three  plants  manufacturing  goat  milk  powder  in 
Weinan  (plant  A),  Jingyang  (plant  B),  and  Yanliang 
(plant  C)  were  selected  in  Shaanxi  province,  China. 
Plants were sampled once from December 2012 to March 
2013, with an interval of about 1 mo between sampling 
of each plant. Latex gloves and disposable plastic boot 
covers  were  worn  for  sample  collection.  Gloves  were 
disinfected with 75% ethanol before sample collection. 
A total of 534 various types of samples were collected, 
including milk powder and environmental swabs. Sites 
for sampling covered most procedures in the plant, and 
the nonprocessing and processing environments of the 
3 plants were also considered. In detail, a total of 28, 
29, and 19 sites were chosen for sampling in Weinan, 
Jingyang, and Yanliang, respectively. At each site, at 
least 3 samples were collected (Table 1).

Samples were collected as follows: 100 cm2 of envi-
ronmental surfaces were collected using a sterile cotton 
swab rehydrated with 10 mL of buffered peptone water; 
500  g  of  goat-milk  powder  was  collected  using  sterile 
sample bags; 500 mL of liquid goat milk was collected 
using a sterile bottle; and air samples were collected by 
exposing Luria-Bertani plates in the air for 5 min. All 
samples were transported on ice and processed within 
24 h of collection.

Escherichia coli Enrichment and Isolation

All samples were used for the isolation and identifica-
tion of E. coli (Duffy et al., 2009). Briefly, 10 mL (or 
10  g)  of  samples  was  mixed  with  90  mL  of  buffered 
peptone  water.  The  solution  was  incubated  at  37°C 
overnight.  After  preenrichment,  a  1-mL  aliquot  was 
transferred to 10 mL of E. coli broth (EC; Beijing Land 
Bridge Technology Ltd., Beijing, China) and incubated 
at 44°C for 22 ± 2 h. Samples that were positive for 
the presence of gas were streaked onto eosin methylene 
blue agar (Beijing Land Bridge Technology Ltd.). Two 
presumptive  E.  coli  colonies  per  sample  were  trans-
ferred to trypticase soy agar plates. Colonies were then 
confirmed as E. coli by PCR detection of the uidA gene. 
All isolates were stored at −80°C until use.

PCR Detection

Six virulence genes specific for each type of diarrhea-
genic E. coli were tested by PCR method: the eae gene 
for enteropathogenic E. coli, the ipaH gene for entero-
invasive E. coli, the elt and est gene for enterotoxigenic 
E. coli, the aggR gene for enteroaggregative E. coli, and 
the stx gene for Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC). 
Primers  for  the  PCR  assays  are  list  in  Table  2.  The 
PCR products were resolved by 1.0% (wt/vol) agarose 
gel electrophoresis in 0.5 × Tris-borate-EDTA buffer.

Serotyping

Pathogenic  E.  coli  isolates  were  serotyped  in  the 
Henan  Center  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention, 
China. O and H antigens were characterized using slide 
agglutination with hyperimmune sera (S&A Company, 
Bangkok, Thailand), and the serotype was assigned fol-
lowing the manufacturer’s instructions.

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing

Antimicrobial  susceptibility  testing  of  E.  coli  was 
performed by the agar dilution method for ciprofloxa-
cin, nalidixic acid, gatifloxacin, ampicillin, gentamicin, 
kanamycin,  amikacin,  streptomycin,  cefoxitin,  cefo-
perazone,  ceftriaxone,  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 
amoxicillin-clavulanate,  chloramphenicol,  and  tetra-
cycline.  Escherichia  coli  ATCC  25922  and  Enterococ-
cus faecalis ATCC 29212 were used as quality control 
strains  in  each  run.  The  breakpoints  used  for  E.  coli 
were  taken  according  to  guidelines  developed  by  the 
Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI, 2013).

PFGE

Pulsed-field  gel  electrophoresis  of  XbaI  (TaKaRa, 
Dalian, China)-digested genomic DNA of E. coli strains 
was  carried  out  as  described  previously  (Gautom, 
1997). The PFGE conditions of XbaI macrorestriction 
analysis were 6 V/cm for 19 h with pulse times ranging 
from 2.16 to 54.17 s at a temperature of 14°C and an 
angle of 120°.

The  gels  were  stained  with  ethidium  bromide,  and 
images  were  taken  under  UV  transillumination  (Bio-
Rad, Hercules, CA). The images were analyzed using 
the  BioNumerics  Software  (Applied-Maths,  Kortrijk, 
Belgium) by using DICE coefficients and the unweight-
ed-pair group method to achieve dendrograms with an 
optimization value of 0.5% and a 1.0% band position 
tolerance. The cluster cutoff was set at 85% similarity. 
Genomic DNA of Salmonella serotype Branderup strain 
H9812 digested with XbaI was used as a molecular-size 
marker.

RESULTS

Isolation of E. coli

Of the 534 samples, 32 (6.0%) samples were positive 
for  E.  coli,  including  24  (17.0%)  of  the  224  samples 
from  the  plant  in  Jingyang  and  8  (9.0%)  of  the  155 
samples from the plant in Yanliang. A total of 53 E. 

coli isolates were recovered from the 32 E. coli–positive 
samples (1 or 2 isolates per sample; Table 3).

The  vast  majority  of  E.  coli–positive  samples  were 
obtained  from  the  milk  storage  tanks  (100%  positive 
rate samples in Jingyang; 80.0% positive rate samples 
in Yanliang). The final milk powder in the package was 
contaminated at a rate of 4.0% with E. coli.

Serotyping and Virulence Detection

Serotyping results showed that not all isolates could 
be typed by the available O antigens and H antigens. 
O antigens of 10 isolates and H antigens of 17 isolates 
could not be determined. Many isolates (11 of 35 iso-
lates) belonged to serotype O125:H5, whereas the other 
4 typeable isolates exhibited different serotypes: O1:H2, 
O125:H18,  O27:H5,  O27:H18,  O121:H5,  O18:H2, 
O27:H2, O63:H5, O103:H40, and O115:H40 (Figure 1). 
Different  O  types  were  observed  in  8  H-nontypeable 
isolates,  among  which  isolates  426A  and  426B,  428A 
and 428B, 560A and 560B, and 679A and 679B reacted 
with the same O antiserums. Among 53 isolates of E. 
coli, none of the 6 virulence genes tested was detected.

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing

Of  the  53  E.  coli  isolates,  resistance  was  most  fre-
quently  observed  to  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 
(75.5%),  followed  by  streptomycin  (32.7%),  and  to  a 
lesser  extent  ampicillin  (20.8%),  tetracycline  (20.8%), 
nalidixic  acid  (7.6%),  cefoxitin  (7.6%),  chlorampheni-
col  (7.6%),  cefoperazone  (5.7%),  gentamicin  (5.7%), 
ciprofloxacin  (3.8%),  and  ceftriaxone  (3.8%).  All  E. 
coli isolates were susceptible to amikacin, gatifloxacin, 
kanamycin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Forty-three 
E. coli isolates (81.1%) were resistant to at least 1 anti-
biotic, and 13 E. coli isolates (24.5%) were resistant to 
at least 3 antibiotics (Table 4).

PFGE

All  of  53  E.  coli  isolates  were  analyzed  for  genetic 
relatedness using PFGE with XbaI. Using a cutoff value 
of  85%,  20  different  PFGE  patterns  were  generated, 
including 13 clusters and 7 individual types (Figure 1). 
The 3 most predominant PFGE clusters were observed 
in  14  (26.4%;  14/53)  isolates  grouped  in  cluster  J,  5 
(9.4%; 5/53) isolates in cluster E, 4 (7.5%; 4/53) iso-
lates in cluster C, and 4 (7.5%; 4/53) isolates in cluster 
M.

DISCUSSION

This study was carried out to assess E. coli contami-
nation in goat-milk-powder plants in Shaanxi province, 
which  is  the  largest  goat-milk  production  area  in 
China. Intervention based on the findings should help 
to  reduce  or  eliminate  microbial  contamination  from 
plants processing goat milk powder.

In  the  present  study,  isolates  of  E.  coli  came  from 
3 plants, and E. coli was not detected in the plant of 
Weinan. The overall contamination rate of E. coli in the

that  reported  in  the  Australian  dairy  powder  factory 
environments  (Duffy  et  al.,  2009).  The  difference  in 
sampling design may account for the discrepancy. The 
study in Australian dairy powder factory environments 
focused on the surfaces of drains, gutters, and shoes.

Escherichia coli was isolated at a high frequency from 
milk storage tanks (90.0%, 9/10), which highlights the 
need  for  vigilance  of  preventing  cross-contamination 
into spray-drying facilities. The packing-room environ-
ment  was  identified  as  an  important  contamination 
source. Operation desks, vents, ground, end products, 
and powder on the ground in the packing room were 
found to be contaminated.

In recent years, the emergence of multiple-antimicro-
bial-resistant strains of E. coli, particularly multidrug-
resistant strains leading to either community-acquired 
and nosocomial infections, has become a major public-
health  concern  (Xu  et  al.,  2014).  Many  researchers 
have  reported  resistant  E.  coli  isolated  from  various 
food samples in different countries (Yang et al., 2004; 
Mora et al., 2005; Ho et al., 2011), but antimicrobial 
resistance of E. coli in plants manufacturing goat milk 
powder has rarely been reported. In the current study, 
only  10  (18.9%)  E.  coli  isolates  were  sensitive  to  all 
tested antibiotics, whereas 24.5% (13/53) of E. coli iso-
lates showed multidrug resistance (resistant to at least 
3  antimicrobials).  Resistance  to  trimethoprim-sulfa-
methoxazole is common (75.5%) among E. coli isolates. 
Compared with antimicrobial-resistance rates of E. coli 
isolates from other food samples (Koo and Woo, 2011; 
Vieira et al., 2011), resistance to these antimicrobials 
in isolates from milk powder plants is generally lower. 
In Korea, a previous study showed that 67.8% of E. coli 
isolated  from  meat  and  meat  products  were  resistant 
to streptomycin, 66.1% to ampicillin, 44.6% to cipro-

floxacin, 41.3% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and 
26.4% to chloramphenicol. The antimicrobial resistance 
of isolates from goat-milk plants is different from that 
from other meats and meat products. This may be ex-
plained by the fact that generally, less antibiotics were 
used in goat farms than in pig or cow farms in China.

The 53 isolates were not found to carry any of the 
6 virulence genes of E. coli, which may be due to the 
limited  number  of  isolates  tested.  Duffy  et  al.  (2009) 
showed  that  only  3  (1%)  of  all  environmental  E.  coli 
isolates  carried  the  virulence  genes  escV  and  eaeA. 
Several studies (Beutin et al., 1993; Blanco et al., 2003; 
Rey et al., 2003; Jacob et al., 2013) have shown that 
goat could be the reservoir of STEC. However, we did 
not find existence of STEC in the plants manufactur-
ing goat milk powder. In the plants we selected, most 
frequent serotypes of E. coli isolates were O125:H5 and 
O1:H2,  which  differed  from  the  serotypes  of  E.  coli 
isolates reported in previous studies focusing on STEC 
(Cortés et al., 2010; Martin and Beutin, 2011; Scheutz 
et al., 2011).

The molecular typing of isolates by PFGE revealed 
the presence of multiple clones of E. coli within each 
plant. With one exception, these strains from different 
plants  were  grouped  in  different  clusters.  Only  clus-
ter J contained isolates from 2 plants with more than 
85% similarity. As shown in Figure 1, PFGE grouped 
isolates from different samples and from different loca-
tions, indicating a certain degree of spread of specific 
clones in the dairy environment. Milk in different stor-
age tanks was contaminated by E. coli of various PFGE 
patterns (such as strain 427, 429, 430), indicating that 
the possible contamination source is the storage tank, 
because milk samples were of the same lot when loaded 
into tanks. Cluster J included E. coli with an identical 
PFGE pattern isolated from a conveyor, powder around

spray drier, operation desk, and air filter and air hole 
of packing room, suggesting dissemination of one clone 
in the packing area. We speculate that E. coli may be 
transmitted by air, which has also been reported in an 
early study (Craven et al., 2010). This highlights the 
importance of maintaining good hygiene at this stage 
of packaging.

In  summary,  this  study  demonstrated  the  presence 
of  E.  coli  in  plants  manufacturing  goat  milk  powder 
in Shaanxi Province, China. Milk storage tank and air 
in the plant could be potential sources of contamina-
tion. These findings provide useful information for the 
milk-powder industry to establish proper management 
practices  that  help  minimize  the  chance  of  microbial 
contamination.
