Introduction

Salmonellosis is a significant foodborne zoonosis and
public health issue worldwide (Berndt et al. 2007). In
Sudan,
the prevalence of Salmonella serovars in
humans and animals is not well documented, as
Salmonella are not routinely isolated and identified.
Only a few studies of Salmonella isolates from
animals in Sudan have been published (Soliman and
Khan 1959; Khan 1961; 1962; 1970; 1971; Khogali et
al. 1973; Yagoub et al. 1987; Mamoun et al. 1992; El

Tom et al. 1999). AbdelRahman et al. (1995) reported
the isolation of Salmonella serovars Dublin and I:13,
23:b:- ; a monophasic variant, from cattle. Yagoub et
al. (2006) reported the isolation of Salmonella Para-
typhi A and Salmonella Paratyphi B from cheese in
Khartoum, Sudan.

During the time period October 2004-May 2005,
we conducted a study to determine the occurrence,
distribution, and antimicrobial resistance patterns of
Salmonella serovars isolated from cattle in the
Khartoum State, Sudan.

Materials and methods

A total of 119 cattle faecal samples were collected for
isolation of Salmonella species. Salmonellae were
isolated from faecal samples and identified following
conventional standard methodology previously de-
scribed (Molla et al. 2006).

Salmonella isolates were tested by the disc
diffusion method for antimicrobial susceptibility
following the guidelines of the National Committee
for Clinical Laboratory Standards (National Commit-
tee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, NCCLS, 2000).
The antimicrobial drugs tested were amikacin,
amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, apramycin,
chloramphenicol, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, cefotax-
ime, colistin, furazolidone, gentamicin, nalidixic acid,
ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, neomycin, streptomycin,

sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, compound sulfon-
amide and tetracycline.

Salmonella isolates were shipped for serotyping to
the OIE Reference Laboratory for Salmonellosis,
Public Health Agency of Canada. Serotyping was
performed as previously described (Molla et al.
2006).

Results and discussion

Four Salmonella isolates were recovered from 119
cattle faecal samples (3.4%) collected in Khartoum
State. Two isolates were serotyped as Salmonella
Drogana. Serotyping of the other two Salmonella
isolates resulted in the antigenic formula 1,3,19:d:1,2
which was not listed in the 8th Edition of the Antigenic
Formulas of the Salmonella Serovars (Popoff 2001) at
the time of testing. These two Salmonella isolates
were shipped for confirmation to the WHO collabo-
rating Centre for Reference and Research on Salmo-
nella, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France. The serological
designation was also confirmed by the National
Salmonella Reference Laboratory at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Atlanta, GA,
USA, and the Institut für Hygiene und Umwelt,
Hamburg, Germany. The new serovar was named
Salmonella Umbadah and assigned as Salmonella
enterica subspecies enterica on the basis of
its
biochemical characteristics. Salmonella Umbadah is
now listed in the 9th Edition of
the Antigenic
Formulae of the Salmonella Serovars (Grimont and
Weill 2007).

The four Salmonella isolates were susceptible to all
the antimicrobial drugs tested. This could reflect
animal husbandry in remote areas within Khartoum
State, Sudan, where antibiotic usage is limited and
indigenous cattle do not come into contact with
animals from outside sources. Further surveillance is
underway to isolate and characterize Salmonella
serovars at both the phenotypic and genotypic levels
from different animals,
food, water and human
sources in Khartoum, Sudan.
