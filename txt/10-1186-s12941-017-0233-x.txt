Abstract 
Background:  Consumption of meat contaminated by E. coli causes a serious illness and even death to affected 
individuals. Recently the emerging of antibiotic resistant foodborne E. coli poses serious public health risks worldwide. 
However, little is known about the antibiotic resistance profile of E. coli in Ethiopia. This study aimed to determine the 
prevalence and Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) status of E. coli isolated from different type of meat.
Methods:  Overall 292 samples were collected from December 2015 to April 2016 from slaughterhouses to deter-
mine the prevalence and AMR of E. coli isolated from raw beef, mutton, chevon and chicken meat from Addis Ababa 
and Bishoftu, Ethiopia. The isolates were screened for AMR against commonly used antibiotics circulating in the 
Ethiopian market. Both phenotypic and genotypic approach were employed for AMR detection using disc diffusion 
test and PCR respectively.
Results:  The prevalence of E. coli was 63 (21.6%), indicating one sample in every five samples harbors E. coli. Among 
these, the highest E. coli isolates was observed in chicken meat samples (37.0%; 27), followed by mutton (23.3%; 17), 
chevon (20.6%; 15) and beef (5.5%; 4). Results of disk diffusion test on the 63 isolates showed that only 4.8% of them 
were not resistance to all antimicrobials tested. Multiple drug resistance (resistance to ≥3 drugs) was 46.0%. Signifi-
cantly high resistance to ampicillin (71.4%) and tetracycline (47.6%) was observed. Identification of genes associated 
with AMR was also done using PCR. The prevalence of E. coli isolates harboring resistance gene responsible for tetracy-
cline (tet(A)), beta lactams (blaCMY) and sulphanamide (sulI) antibiotics were found 65.1, 65.1 and 54.0%, respectively. 
Twenty-five out of the 63 (39.7% %) E. coli isolates have got antimicrobial resistance gene to three or more classes of 
drugs. The associations of antimicrobial resistance phenotypes and resistance genes was also determined. The detec-
tion of resistance trait against tetracycline, sulphametazole and chloramphenicol measured either phenotypically or 
genotypically were high.
Conclusions:  The rising levels of resistance E. coli to multiple antimicrobial dictate the urgent need to regulate and 
monitor antimicrobial use in both animals and humans.

Background
Meat  and  meat  products  serve  as  important  source  of 
proteins  for  humans.  However,  recently  the  emerging 
antibiotic resistant foodborne pathogens combined with 
the injudicious use of antibiotics in animals bears consid-
erate public health threats worldwide. Usually, meat and 
meat  products  gets  contaminated  by  pathogens  during 
animal slaughter and food processing. Escherichia coli (E. 
coli) is the frequently isolated foodborne pathogens from 
meat and meat products. Meat can be contaminated by 
E. coli during animal slaughter due to unhygienic slaugh-
ter  practices,  through  airborne,  rodents,  insects,  and 
other animals [1]. Consumption of meat contaminated by 
E. coli causes a serious illness and even death to affected 
individuals [2].

Methods
Sample collection and isolation of E. coli
The  study  was  carried  out  from  December  2015  to 
April  2016  to  collect  meat  sample  from  Addis  Ababa 
city abattoir enterprise and Alema farm slaughter slab 
found in Bishoftu town, Ethiopia. A total of 292 meat 
sample  including  beef  meat  (n  =  73),  sheep  meat 
(n = 73), goat meat (n = 73) were collected from Addis 
Ababa  municipal  abattoir  and  chicken  meat  (n  =  73) 
from  Alema  farm  slaughter  slab  located  in  Bishoftu 
city.  Sample  were  collected  by  swabbing  from  carcass 
gluteal muscle and inserted into 10 ml peptone water 
containing  test  tube.  The  samples  were  taken  follow-
ing the guidelines of the International Organization for 
Standardization  [10].  The  sample  were  transported  to 
National  Agricultural  Biotechnology  Research  Center 
in an ice box for further processing. The E. coli isolates 
were identified by using standard bacteriological meth-
ods,  comprising  of  colony  structure  determination, 
using different culture media and biochemical tests as 
previously  indicated  [11].  Isolates  were  preserved  at 
−80 °C in a trypticase soy broth with 10% glycerol for 
further analysis.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
Antibiotic  sensitivity  was  determined  by  disc  diffusion 
method  according  to  the  guidelines  of  the  Clinical  and 
Laboratory  Standards  Institute  [12].  Bacterial  suspen-
sion was prepared by adding 2–4 colonies to a 5 ml tube 
containing 0.9% normal saline (NaCl), to achieve absorb-
ance  of  0.17–0.18  at  wavelength  of  600  nm  (equivalent 
to  0.5  McFarland  standards)  [13].  The  suspension  was 
spread  onto  Mueller–Hinton  agar  media  (HIMEDIA, 
India) using a sterile cotton swab, and the antibiotic disc 
(Oxoid, UK) were placed on the top of the agar plate. The 
inoculated plates were incubated aerobically at 37 °C for 
18–24  h,  after  which  all  E.  coli  isolates  were  tested  for 
susceptibility using the following antimicrobial discs and 
their corresponding concentrations: tetracycline (30 μg/
disk); streptomycin (10 μg/disk); chloramphenicol (30 μg/
disk),  sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim 
(25  μg/disk), 
gentamycin (10 μg/disk); ampicillin, (10 μg/disk); eryth-
romycin (15 μg/disk); by the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion 
method [14].

DNA extraction and PCR amplification of resistance genes
Bacterial  strains  were  grown  overnight  in  nutrient  agar 
(HIMEDIA, India) at 37 °C. A loop full of the colonies 
was added to 100 μl of sterile water. Bacterial DNA was 
extracted by boiling a bacterial suspension in water. After 
boiling the suspension for 13 min, the suspension were 
frozen for 5 min in ice and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 
15 min to pellet the cell debris [15]. The supernatant from 

Recently  published  reports  indicated  that  the  E.  coli 
strains isolated from contaminated meat and meat prod-
ucts have become resistant to commonly used antibiot-
ics. This is mainly due to injudicious usage of antibiotics 
in  both  humans  and  animals  [3].  The  wide  spread  and 
imprudent use of antibiotics in food animals is thought 
to be accountable for the emergence and wider spreading 
of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacteria in humans [3, 
4]. In humans, positive selection for drug resistant bac-
teria  have  also  been  reported  in  the  normal  microflora 
of  exposed  individuals  or  populations.  This  indicates 
that antibiotic resistance can be developed in both com-
mensal  and  pathogenic  bacterial  strains  and  can  even 
be transferred to other bacterial strains, including other 
pathogenic and environmental bacteria [5].

Consumption of contaminated and/or uncooked meat 
poses the risks of acquiring foodborne E. coli strains [6] 
causing a serious public health concern. These bacterial 
strains easily harbors antibiotic resistant genes from one 
another. This is because genes encoding AMR determi-
nants that are carried on mobile genetic elements such 
as  plasmids  and  transposons  of  some  bacterial  strains 
could be transferred to other bacteria strains during con-
tact [7], causing a threat to cure acute infections in man 
and animals. In Ethiopia, a review done by Alemu et al. 
[8] showed that several pathogen have established resist-
ance against oxytetracycline drugs. Similarly, oxytetracy-
cline and penstrep are the main prescribed antibiotics in 
Ethiopia [8, 9]. So far, no study has been carried out to 
identify the antibiotic resistance genes of Escherichia coli 
in Ethiopia.

In this paper, we explain the phenotypic and genotypic 
sources  of  MDR  in  Escherichia  coli  isolates  recovered 
from  different  type  of  meat  samples  taken  from  Addis 
Ababa  city  abattoir  and  Alema  farm  poultry  slaughter 
slab, Ethiopia. This enquiry pursues to deliver useful evi-
dence on the prevalence and AMR profile of E. coli iso-
lated from beef, mutton, chevon and chicken meat.

the centrifuged tubes was transferred to new 1.5 ml clean 
plastic tube and used as a template for PCR amplification. 
The  purified  DNA  were  detected  by  electrophoresis  in 
1.5% agarose gel and then kept at −20 °C for further use. 
Primers  for  AMR  genes  such  as  streptomycin  (aadA1), 
tetracycline  [tet(A)],  gentamicin  [aac(3)-IV],  sulfona-
mides  (sul1),  beta-lactams  (blaSHV,  blaCMY),  eryth-
romycin  [ere(A)]  and  chloramphenicol  (catA1,  cmlA) 
were  used  from  published  article.  The  specific  primer 
sequences (Bioneer, South Korea) and the estimated size 
of  the  amplified  products  for  different  resistance  gene 
coding  regions  are  found  in  Table  1.  Amplification  of 
antimicrobial  resistance  gene  from  E.  coli  isolates  were 
performed as described by Fode et al. [16]. The amplifi-
cation products were then separated by electrophoresis 
on a 1.5% agarose gel stained with gel red (Biotium Inc, 
USA)  as  described  by  Huang  et  al.  [17]  and  visualized 
using UV illumination. A 100 bp DNA molecular marker 
(Bioneer, South Korea) were used to determine the size of 
the PCR product.

Statistical analysis
The  prevalence  of  E.  coli  infection  was  quantified  and 
compared among meat samples of different livestock spe-
cies. Prevalence of AMR was quantified along with resist-
ance  patterns.  The  data  were  analyzed  by  using  SPSS 
software version 20 and P value was calculated using Chi 
square and Fisher’s exact tests to determine any signifi-
cant  correlation.  P  value  less  than  0.05  was  considered 
statistically significant.

Results
Prevalence of E. coli
In  this  study,  a  total  of  63  (21.6%)  E.  coli  isolates  were 
identified  from  the  292  raw  meat  samples  examined 
(Table 2). Of these positive cases, chicken meat had the 
highest  (37.0%)  whilst  beef  meat  had  the  lowest  preva-
lence (5.5%) of E. coli. A significance difference in E. coli 
prevalence  (P  <  0.05)  was  observed  among  meat  sam-
ples  of  different  livestock  species.  In  this  regard,  meat 
of chevon 2.8 times, mutton 3.2 times and chicken meat

5.7 times were more infected than beef meat by E. coli 
indicating a difference in E. coli infection risk to humans 
based on meat type.

Phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility test
The  distribution  of  Antimicrobial  resistance  (AMR) 
among the E. coli isolates from meat samples of four live-
stock species was shown in Table 3. The lists of AMR was 
Ampicillin  (71.4%),  tetracycline  (47.6%),  erythromycin 
(42.8%),  streptomycin  (36.5%),  sulfamethoxazole–tri-
methoprim (34.9%), chloramphenicol (23.8%) and genta-
mycin (4.8%). Among the E. coli isolates identified from 
meat  of  different  food  animals,  resistance  to  ampicil-
lin  was  highest  in  chevon  (86.7%),  followed  by  chicken 
(70.4%),  mutton  (64.7%)  and  beef  meat  (50%)  as  pre-
sented in Table 3.

Of  63  isolates,  only  3  isolates  (4.8%)  were  pan-sensi-
tive and the rest were single drug resistance (12 isolates; 
20.4%), double drug resistance (19; 30.2%) and multidrug 
(≥3 or more drugs) resistance (29; 46.0%). Two isolates 
demonstrated resistance to six different drugs. The AMR 
patterns  and  AMR  frequencies  were  shown  in  Table  4. 
The  most  common  AMR  pattern  found  in  the  multire-
sistant  isolates  was  ampicillin,  tetracycline  and  eryth-
romycin which jeopardizes the use of these drugs in the 
study area.

Molecular detection of antimicrobial resistance
All of the 63 E. coli isolates were confirmed by PCR to 
determine the existence of any AMR gene. The erythro-
mycin esterase gene ere(A) and the aminoglycoside ade-
nylyl transferases genes aadA1 were not identified in any 
of the 63 E. coli isolates (Fig. 1). The ere(A) gene confers 
resistance  to  erythromycin  whilst  aadA1  gene  confer 
resistance to streptomycin. The most commonly detected 
AMR  genes  were  blaCMY  (65.1%),  tetA  (65.1%)  and 
sul1 (54.0%). The distribution of resistance genes among 
E.  coli  isolates  are  summarized  in  Table  5.  The  blaSHV, 
β-lactamase  gene  and  blaCMY  genes  were  identified  in 
4.8  and  65.1%  of  the  isolates,  respectively.  The  aac(3)-
IV gene which codes resistance against gentamycin was 
found also in 14.3% of isolates.

Overall,  39.7%  (25/63)  of  isolates  harbored  resist-
ance gene responsible to three or more drugs (Table 6). 
The most commonly detected genes were tetA, sul1, and 
blaCMY. The most common pattern detected was sulI and 
tet(A) together (n = 23; 36.5%) followed by blaCMY and 
tetA (n = 22; 35.0%) and  blaCMY and sulI (n = 20; 31.7%).

onstrated  resistance  by  disk  diffusion  method  were

coli was 21.6%. The study indicated that E. coli was 2.8 
times, 3.2 times, and 5.7 times more prevalent in chevon, 
mutton  and  chicken  meat,  respectively,  than  in  beef 
meat. It implies that meat of livestock species types has 
a difference in magnitude of E. coli infection, therefore, 
has implications on the risk to public health. It has been 
reported  that  poor  hygienic  practices  is  responsible  for 
contamination of meat by E. coli [20]. The magnitude of 
E. coli prevalence in this study was similar to the previ-
ous  studies  in  different  part  of  Ethiopia  22.2,  26.6  and 
20.3%  by  Haileselassie  et  al.  [21],  Haimanot  et  al.  [22] 
and  Bitew  et  al.  [23]  respectively.  However,  Mekonen 
et al. [24] and Taye et al. [25] also reported higher preva-
lence of carcass contamination with an overall isolation 
rate  of  40  and  30.97%,  respectively.  The  current  study 
deals  with  the  magnitude  of  E.  coli  only  at  one  point 
(i.e.  slaughterhouse)  of  the  food  chain  until  it  reaches 
the fork. It shouldn’t be overlooked that there could be 
ample  chances  for  E.  coli  to  infect  the  meat  released 
from the slaughterhouse during transport, handling and 
processing chains before it reaches the consumer (fork) 
as hygienic practices are substandard in Ethiopia. It has 
been reported that poor hygienic practices is responsible 
for contamination of meat by E. coli [20].

In the current study, the prevalence of E. coli was sig-
nificantly higher in chicken meat than in chevon, mutton 
and beef meat. This might be attributed to husbandry and 
production  systems  where,  small  holder  farmers  prefer 
to rear their chickens in backyard to scavenge. Thus, E. 
coli could be transmitted from intestinal normal flora of

consistent  with  the  most  common  resistance  genes 
detected  (Table  7).  Tetracycline,  sulfamethoxazole  and 
chloramphenicol  were  top  three  drugs  recognized  as 
being the most common for resistance measured either 
disk  diffusion  or  molecular  method.  However,  the  phe-
notypic and genotypic resistance characterization of the 
isolates  to  erythromycin,  streptomycin  and  gentamycin 
were not correlated.

Discussion
The  magnitude  of  E.  coli  prevalence  and  its  AMR  pat-
terns  were  investigated  in  raw  meat  samples  of  four 
livestock species at Addis Ababa and Bishoftu slaughter 
house.  In  our  study,  in  raw  meat,  the  prevalence  of  E.

livestock to the chicken via the food chain [26]. Over all, 
the  variations  observed  among  the  reported  prevalence 
could  be  emanated  from  difference  in  hygiene,  breed, 
geographical origins of animals and history of treatment 
with antimicrobial.

Emergence  and  dissemination  of  antimicrobial  resist-
ance  is  on  the  increase  trend  among  enteric  bacteria 
[27]. In this research the overall result showed that sig-
nificantly  high  resistance  rate  to  ampicillin  (71.4%)  and 
tetracycline  (47.6%).  More  importantly,  in  the  current 
report,  chicken  meat  harbored  the  highest  number  of 
drug resistant E. coli isolates compared to the other meat 
origins. As expected, the most common resistance were 
found  to  older  drugs  such  as  ampicillin  (Introduced  in 
1961) followed by tetracycline (Introduced in 1948) [28]. 
Similarly, Momtaz et al. [29] observed that tetracycline, 
sulfamethoxazole,  chloramphenicol  and  trimethoprim 
resistance was the most common finding with the prev-
alence  rate  of  91.2,  45.6  and  29.8%  respectively.  Like-
wise, studies conducted in Korem, Ethiopia on diarrheic 
patients showed that the highest E. coli resistance were 
found  against  ampicillin  followed  by  chloramphenicol, 
and  tetracycline  [30].  Hiko  et  al.  [31]  also  found  that 
the  isolated  E.  coli  is  highly  resistant  to  streptomycin, 
cephlaothin,  tetracycline,  ampicillin  and  trimethoprim. 
Another study revealed that all E. coli isolates from beef 
were found 100% resistance to ampicillin and amoxicil-
lin and 33.33% to tetracycline [25]. The observed higher 
level  of  antimicrobial  resistance  might  be  attributed  to 
the  widespread  and  indiscriminate  use  of  antibiotics  in 
animals for medication and other prophylaxis purposes. 
Although tetracycline has the second most resistance in 
this study, it is one of the most commonly used antibiot-
ics for the treatment of different infections, including E. 
coli in Ethiopia.

Recently,  among  gram  negative  bacteria,  multidrug 
resistant  (MDR)  phenotypes  are  spreading  widely  [32].
In  the  current  study,  the  overall  rate  of  multiple  drug 
resistance was 46.0% and only 4.8% of the isolates were 
found sensitive to all antimicrobials tested (Table 4). This 
is in agreement with the findings of Schroeder et al. [33]

most  frequently  co-transferred  resistance  phenotypes. 
However, Daniel et al. [28] reported a resistance profile 
of  tetracycline  (80%)  and  streptomycin  (74%),  among 
the sulfonamide-resistant E. coli isolates. The transfer of 
resistance among microorganisms has long been recog-
nized  as  a  serious  threat,  contributing  to  the  evolution 
and  emergence  of  antibiotic  resistant  bacteria,  thereby 
reducing  the  therapeutic  potential  against  pathogens 
[36].

After  phenotypic  screening,  genes  associated  with 
antimicrobial resistance was analyzed using PCR. In this 
study,  the  most  commonly  detected  resistance  genes 
were blaCMY (65.1%), tetA (65.1%) and sul1 (54.0%)) for 
cephalosporin, tetracycline and sulfonamide respectively. 
However,  streptomycin  and  erythromycin  resistance 
genes were not detected. In Iran, among the E. coli iso-
lates, 52.6% of resistance to tetracycline as well as 47.4% 
for  both  sulfonamides  and  erythromycin  was  reported 
[31].  The  prevalence  of  different  resistance  genes  from 
pediatric patient E. coli isolate were also reported 85.06, 
60.38,  57.79,  90.25,  40.25  and  54.54%  positive  for  tetA, 
cmlA,  SHV  β-lactamase,  CITM,  sul1  and  aac(3)-IV 
resistance genes respectively [37].

The phenotypic and genotypic resistance patterns with 
in the same E. coli isolates might be strongly correlated 
[38]. In our research, detection of tetracycline resistance 
by disk diffusion test and identification of its resistance 
gene tet(A) by PCR test, sulfamethoxozole–trimethoprim 
and sulI, chloramphenicol and cmlA were strongly asso-
ciated. But there was a lack of association between phe-
notypic erythromycin resistance and molecular detection 
of ere(A), streptomycin and aadA1, chloramphenicol and 
catA1  resistance  gene.  Similarly,  reports  from  Thailand 
showed  that,  E.  coli  isolates  from  chickens  were  found 
to  be  resistant  to  tetracycline  (90%)  and  erythromycin 
(73.3%)  in  Agar  disk  diffusion  assays  and  these  resist-
ance  properties  were  associated  with  tet(A)  and  ere(A) 
resistance genes respectively [4]. However, the presence 
of  resistance  phenotypes  might  not  represent  all  the 
underlying  resistance  genes.  Alternatively,  the  presence 

or  absence  of  a  resistance  gene  might  not  indicate  the 
particular isolate is resistant or susceptible to an antimi-
crobial [39].

The  observed  discrepancy  in  the  resistance  level  of 
genotypes and phenotypes might be attributed to either 
of or combination of the reasons including but not lim-
ited to the presence of unexpressed genes in the bacte-
rial isolates, not containing the possible resistance genes 
in  the  test,  use  of  incorrect  cut  points  of  test  results 
used  for  resistance  and  susceptibility  classification,  or 
some  of  resistance  phenotypes  are  caused  by  due  to 
point mutations rather than gene transfer or acquisition 
[40].

Conclusions
This study revealed that raw meat available for consum-
ers in Ethiopia was often contaminated with E. coli. We 
reported  on  a  comprehensive  study  of  the  phenotypic 
and molecular basis for Multi Drug Resistance (MDR) in 
meat E. coli isolates recovered from Ethiopian Abattoir. 
Furthermore, a high rate of resistance to Ampicillin and 
resistance to more than one class of antibiotics among E. 
coli isolates was found. Additionally, several strains were 
found positive for the blaCMY, tet(A), and sul1 antimicro-
bial resistance genes. All these findings suggest that the 
consumption  of  undercooked  meat  or  food  cross-con-
taminated with E. coli may pose a serious threat to con-
sumer health.
