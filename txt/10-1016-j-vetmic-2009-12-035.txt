The prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter spp. in broiler chickens were
determined in Shandong Province, China. In total, 275 Campylobacter isolates were
including 208 Campylobacter jejuni, 53
obtained from 767 broiler cecal samples,
Campylobacter coli, and 14 unidentiﬁed Campylobacter isolates. Minimal
inhibitory
concentrations of 11 antimicrobial agents were determined using the agar dilution
method recommended by CLSI. More than 98% of the tested Campylobacter isolates were
resistant to quinolones (nalidixic acid, ciproﬂoxacin and enroﬂoxacin) and tetracyclines
(tetracycline and doxycycline). The C. jejuni isolates also exhibited a high rate of resistance
to phenicol antibiotics and a moderate rate of resistance to macrolides and gentamicin. On
the contrary, the C. coli isolates showed a high-level resistance to macrolides and
gentamicin and little resistance to phenicol antibiotics. The vast majority of the
Campylobacter isolates were classiﬁed as multidrug resistant. These ﬁndings reveal a broad
extent of antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter isolates from poultry in China and
underline the need for prudent use of antibiotics in poultry production to minimize the
spread of antibiotic resistant Campylobacter.

1. Introduction

Thermophilic Campylobacter, including Campylobacter
jejuni and Campylobacter coli, is a main bacterial cause
of acute gastroenteritis in humans in both developing
and developed countries (Blaser, 1997; Englen et al.,
2007). Campylobacter
also associated
with the development of Guillain-Barre´ syndrome, a
neurological disorder affecting the peripheral nervous
system (Yuki, 2001; Leonard et al., 2004). For clinical

infection is

treatment of campylobacteriosis, macrolide and ﬂuor-
oquinolone antibiotics are often prescribed, however,
Campylobacter resistance to both classes of antibiotics
is on the rise (Payot et al., 2006; Gibreel and Taylor,
2006).

As a foodborne pathogen, Campylobacter is transmitted
to humans via contaminated food and water (Allos, 2001).
Particularly, the chicken is a natural host of C. jejuni and
serves as a major reservoir for this pathogenic organism
(Sahin et al., 2002; Lee and Newell, 2006). Contamination
of chicken carcasses by Campylobacter often occurs during
the slaughtering process and consumption of chicken meat
is a signiﬁcant source of human Campylobacter infections
(Humphrey et al., 2007). Thus control of Campylobacter in
poultry should yield a positive impact on improving food
safety.

For modern poultry production, antimicrobial agents
have been widely used for growth promotion and disease
control. Many of
the antimicrobials used for animal
agriculture are also used for human medicine. Thus,
agricultural use of antibiotics poses a risk for selecting
antibiotic resistant pathogens that can be potentially
transmitted to humans and may compromise clinical
treatment. Indeed, previous studies have shown that use
of certain antimicrobials in chickens, especially ﬂuoroqui-
nolones, rapidly select for antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter
(McDermott et al., 2002; Luo et al., 2003). Many studies have
reported the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant Campy-
lobacter in animal reservoirs in different countries (Bachoual
et al., 2001; Gibreel and Taylor, 2006; Alfredson and Korolik,
2007; Hariharan et al., 2009; Luangtongkum et al., 2009).
However, little information is available on the prevalence
and antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter from poultry
in China, where poultry production represents an important
sector of animal husbandry and consumption of poultry
meat is signiﬁcant. In this study, we surveyed several broiler
slaughter houses in ﬁve different regions of Shandong
Provinces and determined the prevalence and antimicrobial
resistance of Campylobacter in multiple chicken ﬂocks.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Isolation and Identiﬁcation of Campylobacter

Campylobacter strains were isolated from cecal contents
of broiler chickens, which were selected randomly from
ﬁve different geographical areas in Shandong Province,
China. All samples were collected in June 2008 from ﬁve
slaughterhouses located in the southeast (Linyi), north
(Zouping and Penglai), northwest (Longkou), and west
(Shenxian) of Shandong Province. The samples were
collected from 45 ﬂocks (Table 1). From each ﬂock, 15
up to 20 samples were collected.

The collected ceca were individually packed and
transported on ice to the laboratory within 5 hours of
collection. For each cecum, a loopful of the fecal content
was directly streaked onto Campylobacter Selective Agar
(Base) (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, England) containing 5%
fresh sterile deﬁbrinated sheep blood and Campylobacter
supplement III (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for primary
isolation. The plates were incubated in an environment of
10% CO2, 5% O2 and 85% N2 at 42 8C for 36–48 h. One
suspected colony was isolated from each cecal sample.

The isolates were identiﬁed to the genus/species level
by multiplex PCR with three pairs of primers amplifying
the 16S rRNA gene speciﬁc for the genus of Campylobacter
(Linton et al., 1997), the HipO gene speciﬁc for C. jejuni, and
the CC amplicon (located in the 16S–23S rRNA region)
speciﬁc for C. coli (Keramas et al., 2003). The primers were
listed in Table 2.

For PCR, crude chromosomal DNA of the isolates was
prepared by boiling as described previously (Bachoual
et al., 2001). The PCR mixture consisted of 10 mL of 2 PCR
MasterMix (TIANGEN, Beijing, China), 0.4 mL of 10 nmol/L
of each primer, 1 mL of chromosomal DNA template, and
6.6 mL of sterile distilled water. The PCR was carried out in
a Veriti 96 well Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA) with the following cycling conditions: heat
denaturation at 95 8C for 5 min, 35 cycles at 95 8C for 35 s,
56.5 8C for 40 s, 72 8C for 45 s, and a ﬁnal extension at 72 8C
for 7 min. The C. jejuni ATCC 33560TM and C. coli ATCC
33559TM strains obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) were used as the positive
control.

2.2. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Campylobacter
isolates

The agar dilution method was used to determine the
susceptibility of Campylobacter isolates to 11 antimicrobial

agents: nalidixic acid, ciproﬂoxacin, enroﬂoxacin, erythro-
mycin, clindamycin, azithromycin, chloramphenicol, ﬂorfe-
nicol, tetracycline, doxycycline, and gentamicin. All the
antimicrobial agents were obtained from China Institute of
Veterinary Drug Control (Beijing, China) except nalidixic
acid which was obtained from Sigma. The susceptibility
testing was performed according to the guideline of Clinical
and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (2008). Fresh
bacterial colonies taken directly from agar plates incubated
for 24 h were re-suspended in sterile Mueller–Hinton broth
to obtain a suspension of 0.5 McFarland turbidity. Two
microliters of the bacterial colony suspension was inocu-
lated onto the plates containing the antimicrobial agents. C.
jejuni ATCC 33560TM was included on every plate as a quality
control. The results were judged by minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC), which was deﬁned as the lowest
concentration of antimicrobial agent that prevented visible
bacterial growth on the testing plates. For the accuracy of
the test, the MICs of all the strains were repeated three
times. Test concentrations and breakpoint for each anti-
microbial agent, and quality control (QC) MIC ranges with C.
jejuni ATCC33560TM are shown in Table 3. An isolate
resistant to three or more classes of antimicrobial agents
was considered to be multidrug resistant.

3. Results

3.1. Campylobacter prevalence

Of the 767 samples, 275 (35.9%) Campylobacter isolates
were obtained, among which 208, 53, and 14 were
identiﬁed as C. jejuni, C. coli, and unidentiﬁed Campylo-
bacter species, respectively (Table 1). Of the 45 sampled
ﬂocks, 35 (77.8%) were positive for Campylobacter, with a
ﬂock prevalence for different regions ranging from 75.0% to
100%. The isolation rate varied greatly from region to
region, ranging from 14.6% to 67.4%. Interestingly, the
majority of the C. coli isolates were from two regions
including Penglai and Shenxian, while the isolates from
Linyi and Zouping were predominately C. jejuni.

Seven isolates did not grow during the antimicrobial
susceptibility testing, so their data were not available in
this study. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed
on with 202 C. jejuni and 52 C. coli isolates. The MICs of all
11 antimicrobial agents tested against C.
jejuni ATCC
33560TM (quality control) were within the CLSI 2008-
deﬁned QC ranges, indicating the good quality of the MIC
testing plates. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance
in the C. jejuni and C. coli isolates are presented respectively
in Tables 4 and 5. All the isolates were resistant to
tetracycline, and the vast majority were also resistant to
ﬂuoroquinolones (>98.0%) and doxycycline (>98.1%).
Notably,
isolates had
ciproﬂoxacin MICs 128 mg/mL, indicating the high-level
resistance to ﬂuoroquinolones. For quinolones (ciproﬂox-
acin, enroﬂoxacin and nalidixic acid), the overall resistance
rates were similar between C. jejuni and C. coli, but it
appeared that the resistance levels (reﬂected by the MIC
values) in C. jejuni were higher than in C. coli. Compared to
other antimicrobial agents, the resistance rates to macro-
lides (erythromycin and azithromycin) and clindamycin
were relatively low in C. jejuni (8.9%, 26.7%, and 13.9%,
respectively), however, the C. coli isolates were highly
resistant to these antibiotics (100%, 98.1%, and 100%,
respectively). Interestingly, the prevalence of ﬂorfenicol
and chloramphenicol resistance was signiﬁcantly higher in
C. jejuni (79.2% and 30.7%, respectively) than in C. coli (1.9%
and 3.8%, respectively). Another notable observation of this
study was the high prevalence of gentamicin resistance,
especially in the C. coli isolates (92.3%).

The prevalence of multidrug resistance in the Campy-
lobacter isolates is shown in Table 6. Over 90% of the C.
jejuni (188 out of 202 isolates) and all the C. coli isolates
were resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents. The most
common multidrug resistant pattern in C. jejuni was the
resistance to ﬂuoroquinolones, tetracyclines and chlor-
amphenicol/ﬂorfenicol. In C. coli, most of the isolates (45
out of 52 isolates) showed resistance to all classes of

antimicrobial agents tested except to the chlorampheni-
col/ﬂorfenicol class. Overall, the C. coli
isolates were
resistant to more antimicrobial agents than the C. jejuni
isolates (Table 6).

4. Discussion

In this study, Campylobacter spp. were isolated from
35.9% of chicken cecal samples and most of the isolates
were C. jejuni. This ﬁnding is consistent with previous
reports that C. jejuni is the predominant Campylobacter
species isolated from chicken intestinal tracts (Newell and
Wagenaar, 2000; Sahin et al., 2002). However, the isolation
rates of C. jejuni and C. coli varied among the ﬁve regions
surveyed in this study. For example, most of the C. coli
isolates were from Penglai and Shenxian, while samples
from the other three regions mainly yielded C. jejuni. The
reasons for the variations are unknown and could be
attributable to differences in production practices and
environments. Similarly, reports by other investigators
also reported wide variation in the prevalence of Campy-
lobacter in other countries. A 50% isolation rate of C. jejuni

from chickens was reported in South Africa (Bester and
Essack, 2008), compared to 20.8% in Grenada (Hariharan
et al., 2009). C. coli is often detected in pigs (Varela et al.,
2007), but a high prevalence (44.4%) in broiler chickens
was also reported in Grenada (Hariharan et al., 2009).

Our ﬁndings revealed the high prevalence of ﬂuor-
oquinolone-resistant Campylobacter in poultry in China.
The prevalence of ﬂuoroquinolone-resistant Campylobac-
ter varies greatly between different countries. No ﬂuor-
oquinolone-resistant isolates were detected in Norway
(Norstro¨ m et al., 2007), and a 9.4% ciproﬂoxacin resistance
rate was reported in Grenada (Hariharan et al., 2009). In
contrast to the low resistance reported in the above two
studies, ciproﬂoxacin-resistant Campylobacter was high in
India (77.1%) (Jain et al., 2005), the United Arab Emirates
(85.4%) (Sonnevend et al., 2006), and South Africa (91%)
(Bester and Essack, 2008). Our results were comparable
with the ﬁndings in the latter countries. The high
ﬂuoroquinolone-resistance rates of Campylobacter in our
study may be attributed to the widespread use of
ﬂuoroquinolones in poultry production in China. This
class of antibiotics is used for both prevention and control

is well known that use of
ﬂuoroquinolones in poultry selects for ﬂuoroquinolone-
resistant mutants and leads to the emergence of ﬂuor-
oquinolone-resistant Campylobacter in the treated birds
(Luangtongkum et al., 2009). In addition, ﬂuoroquinolone-
resistant Campylobacter does not show a ﬁtness cost and
can effectively compete against ﬂuoroquinolone-suscep-
tible Campylobacter
in chickens in the absence of
antibiotics (Luo et al., 2005).

Similar to ﬂuoroquinolones, the resistance to tetra-
cyclines was also highly prevalent in the Campylobacter
isolates obtained in this study. This ﬁnding is consistent
with previously reported studies on tetracycline-resistant
Campylobacter in other regions (Cui et al., 2005; Luang-
tongkum et al., 2006; Bester and Essack, 2008). With
macrolides and clindamycin, the resistance rate of C. coli
to these two classes of drugs was much higher than C.
jejuni in this study. Since the majority of the C. coli isolates
were from Penglai and Shenxian, we further compared the
macrolide resistance rates of C. coli and C. jejuni from these
two regions. For each of the two regions, the prevalence of

resistance to macrolides and clindamycin was much
higher than that for C. jejuni (data not shown), suggesting
that the difference is likely due to the intrinsic ability of C.
coli to develop resistance to the antibiotics. Similarly, the
level of gentamicin resistance (Tables 4 and 5) was
moderate for C. jejuni (27.2%), but very high for C. coli
(92.3%). Overall, the gentamicin resistance rates identiﬁed
in this study are much higher than reported in other
studies (Trieber and Taylor, 2000). Further study is
required to determine what contribute to the high-level
resistance to macrolides, clindamycin and gentamicin in
the C. coli isolates.

(Table 4), which is in contrast

Another interesting ﬁnding of this study is the high rate
of resistance in C. jejuni to the phenicols, especially to
ﬂorfenicol
to many
previously reported studies in other countries (Trieber
and Taylor, 2000; Hariharan et al., 2009). The high
resistance rate to ﬂorfenicol was likely due to the long-
term use of this antibiotic as a growth promoter for broilers
in China prior to 2006. However, the usage of ﬂorfenicol in
poultry production may not totally explain the high

resistance rate, because the C. coli isolates obtained in this
study were basically susceptible to the phenicols despite
the fact that they were also exposed to the same selection
pressure. Other mechanisms might also have contributed
to the prevalence of and difference in phenicol resistance
in the C. jejuni and C. coli isolates.

A large number of Campylobacter isolates obtained in
this study showed a multidrug resistance phenotype.
Many of the C.
jejuni isolates were multi-resistant to
ﬂuoroquinolones, tetracyclines and phenicols, while the
majority of the C. coli isolates had multidrug resistance to
all classes of test agents except to phenicols. Few reports
observed such a high frequency multidrug resistance in
Campylobacter as reported in this study. The multidrug
resistance patterns along with the high MICs of various
antibiotics may reﬂect the overuse of different antimicro-
bial agents in the poultry production. Once it is prevalent,
removal of antibiotic selection pressure may not simply
diminish antibiotic resistance.

In conclusion, antimicrobial resistance is highly pre-
valent in the poultry Campylobacter isolates from Shan-
dong, China, and many of them are resistant to multiple
antimicrobial agents with high MIC values. Although
Campylobacter as a cause for foodborne diseases is still
underestimated in China, the high prevalence of multi-
drug resistant Campylobacter in broilers is alarming, given
the fact that contaminated poultry meat is the major
source of human Campylobacter infections. Foodborne
transmission of antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter to
humans compromises the clinical treatment of human
campylobacteriosis. Thus, prudent measures for antimi-
crobial usage and active surveillance should be estab-
lished to reduce the prevalence and spread of
antimicrobial resistant Campylobacter.
