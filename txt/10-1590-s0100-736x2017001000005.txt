In this study, avian extraintestinal Escherichia coli obtained from the liver of poultry 
carcasses approved for human consumption in the State of Pernambuco-Brazil were tes-
ted for antibiotic plus serum-resistance. Liver samples (n=110) were obtained from one 
slaughterhouse and 88 bacterial isolates were identified as Escherichia coli. The antibiotic-
-resistance profiles of antibiotics used in human and/or veterinary practice were accessed 
by the disk-diffusion method. Phenotypes with high resistance to streptomycin (84.0%), 
tetracycline (44.7%), amikacin (29.8%), gentamicin (21.3%) and ciprofloxacin (21.3%) 
were identified. Resistance to antibiotics such as ceftazidime, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 
and imipenem was also recorded. Twenty isolates with distinct antibiotic-resistance and 
susceptibility profiles were selected for serum resistance assays, phylogenetic characteri-
zation and detection of the iss gene. We have shown that multidrug resistant isolates were 
often simultaneously resistant to broiler and human sera. Phylogenetic characterization of 
serum- plus antibiotic-resistant isolates have shown three belonging to group D, eleven to 
group B1, one to group B2, and five to group A. We concluded that commensal E. coli strains 
isolated from the liver of healthy poultry carcasses can harbor and potentially share multi-
drug- plus virulence genes found in pathogenic pathotypes. This suspicion was not related 
to specific phylogenetic groups or presence of the iss gene.

caracterização filogenética e detecção do gene iss. Foi de-
monstrado que isolados resistentes a múltiplas drogas fo-
ram também simultaneamente resistentes ao soro de fran-
gos e ao soro humano. A caracterização filogenética desses 
isolados mostraram três pertencentes ao grupo D, onze ao 
grupo B1, um ao grupo B2 e cinco ao grupo A. Conclui-se 
que E. coli comensais isoladas do fígado de carcaças de aves

genes de resistência a drogas e de virulência encontrados 
em patotipos patogênicos. Essa suspeita não foi relaciona-

The inclusion of antibiotics in broiler feed is often asso-
ciated with improved growth rate, feed efficiency and in-
creased animal production. However, this practice has 
been banned in developed countries due to possibility of 
transferring conjugative plasmids and transposons betwe-
en bacterial strains of the gut microbiota (Aarestrup et al. 
2001). Although Brazil has been the world’s largest export-
er of chicken meat since 2004, few studies were performed 
to clarify the risk for human health from consuming poultry 
contaminated by drug-resistant  Escherichia  coli. Further-
more, antimicrobials of different classes are authorized for 
non-veterinary usage in the country (Brasil 2015). Since 
some of these drugs are of the same class of those indicat-
ed to human use, the risk of producing multidrug-resistant 
pathotypes through the food chain is significant.
The spread of infections caused by extraintestinal pa-
thogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) is among the main pro-
blems of the modern poultry industry. ExPEC pathotypes 
such as avian pathogenic  E.  coli (APEC) can cause mul-
tifactorial diseases that affect chickens, turkeys, parrots 
and other bird species (Delicato et al. 2003). Virulence 
mechanisms includes iron acquisition systems, produc-
tion of toxins, adhesion capacity, presence of capsular 
antigens and temperature-sensitive hemagglutinins (Ro-
driguez-Siek et al. 2005). However, resistance to serum 
complement is considered the hallmark of virulence for 
APEC strains and serum sensitive bacteria often are una-
ble to colonize internal organs. Accordingly, the increased 
serum survival gene (iss), found in ColV and ColBM plas-
mids, has been used as virulence marker together with 
other candidate genes for diagnostic purposes (Johnson 
et al. 2006).
Human serum resistance among ExPEC allows survival 
in the host’s bloodstream and can potentially lead to disse-
minated infections. Although the potential of the APEC pa-
thotype to cause human infections through the food chain 
is unclear, it can colonize the intestinal tract and enhance 
virulence gene transfer to human strains. For example, 
APEC strains and urogenital pathogenic E. coli (UPEC) cau-
sing human infections were shown to share large genomic 
sequences (Johnson et al. 2007, Kariyawasam et al. 2007). 

In a previous study, we have shown that multidrug-resis-
tant E. coli harboring the iss gene obtained from poultry 
carcasses may resist the human serum and cause patho-
genesis in the murine model (Lima-Filho et al. 2013). In 
this study, avian extraintestinal Escherichia coli obtained 
from the liver of poultry carcasses approved for human 
consumption in the State of Pernambuco-Brazil were tes-
ted for antibiotic plus serum-resistance. Phylogenetic cha-
racterization serum- plus antibiotic-resistant isolates was 
conducted. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample  collection. Three lots of poultry carcasses were 
analyzed at random, as follows: lot 1 (n=50); lot 2 (n=30) and 
lot 3 (n=30). Liver samples (n=110) without macroscopic altera-
tions and approved for human consumption were obtained from 
one slaughterhouse in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. The livers 
were obtained aseptically just after the evisceration of carcasses 
at one single location in the poultry processing plant. The samples 
were packed in sterile Petri dishes and kept into sealed bags while 
transported in isothermal food containers containing recyclable 
ice. Samples were processed in the Microbiology and Immuno-
logy Laboratory (Department of Biology, Pernambuco Federal 
Rural University) no longer than 120 min after collection. These 
samples were macerated (1:10; w:v) in brain heart infusion broth 
(BHI) for enrichment and incubated overnight at 37°C. Then, sus-
pected cultures were seeded on eosin methylene blue agar (EMB), 
and were incubated overnight at 37°C. Typical colonies of green 
color with metallic luster were submitted to Citrate, VM-VP and 
indole biochemical tests and confirmed phenotypically to be  E. 
coli (Franco, de Melo, G., Landgraf 2004).
Antibiotic-resistance assays. The resistance profiles to an-
timicrobials of veterinary and/or human use were carried out by 
the standard disk-diffusion method (CLSI 2012). All tests were 
carried out in duplicate against twelve antimicrobials (Cecon®): 
amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (10µg), cefalotin (30µg), ceftazidim 
(30µg), aztreonam (30µg), imipenem (10µg), gentamicin (10µg), 
amikacin (30µg), streptomycin (10µg), ciprofloxacin (5µg), levo-
floxacin (5µg), chloramphenicol (30µg), tetracycline (30µg). The 
results were interpreted as sensitive (S), moderately sensitive (I) 
or resistant (R). The breakpoints for resistance were those re-
commended by CLSI. Multidrug resistance was determined when 
bacterial isolates were resistant to antimicrobials of at least three 
different classes (Magiorakos et al. 2012). The isolates obtained 
from a single sample with an identical antibiotic resistance/sensi-
tivity profile were treated as a single strain. In this case, bacterial 
replicates were not conducted. Twenty isolates (2, 9, 12, 51, 52, 
53, 54, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 71, 72, 73) with dis-
tinct antibiotic-resistance profiles were selected for serum resis-
tance assays, phylogenetic characterization and detection of the 
iss gene.Phylogenetic  characterization. Phylogenetic analysis was 
performed in the Microbiology and Animal Immunology Labora-
tory (Vale do São Francisco Federal University, Petrolina, PE), as 
follows: genomic DNA from E. coli was obtained by thermal lysis.

among selected E. coli strains (n=20) presenting distinct antibiotic 
against severe human gram-negative infections (Morrill et

from Samuelsen et al. (2004). Mixed preparations containing hu-

resistant to avian serum (except for strain 64). But isola-
tes lacking this gene were also resistant to the human and 
broiler sera, and therefore other genes may be involved in 
virulence. Ewers et al. (2009), who compared strains from 
diseased chickens with fecal E. coli strains from clinically 
healthy chickens, found no relationship between resistan-
ce to bird serum and virulence of the APEC pathotype. On 
the other hand, in this study, a significant number of mul-
tidrug resistant avian E. coli were simultaneously resistant 
to human and broiler serum, which clearly demonstrates 
a zoonotic risk. Extraintestinal pathogenic  E.  coli strains 
are commonly associated with the group B2, and less of-
ten with group D (Russo & Johnson 2000). Nevertheless, 
sequencing of APEC-related plasmid pAPEC-1 has shown 
human ExPEC-associated genes and horizontal gene trans-
fer between human and bird strains (Moulin-Schouleur et 
al. 2007). Here E. coli isolates were distributed in phyloge-
netic group B2, D, A and B1. Thus, it was clear that serum-
-resistant commensal strains, e.g., those belonging to group 
A and B1, can also harbor and possibly share virulence ge-
nes such as the iss.
Previously, Rodriguez-Siek et al. (2005) observed the 
presence of APEC isolates in phylogenetic group A, recog-
nized by being composed primarily of commensal strains. 
Moulin-Schouleur et al. (2007) found APEC strains assigned 
to group B1 and B2 whereas Ewers et al. (2009) found sim-
ilar distributions of bird serum resistant strains in phylo-
genetic group A, B1, B2, and D. Kobayashi et al. (2011) an-
alyzed E. coli isolated from chicken meat obtained in retail 
shops, assigning the majority to group A. In this study, mul-
tidrug and/or human serum resistance was spread among 
isolates from B1, A, and D phylogenetic groups. Although 
the number of isolates submitted to serum resistant assays 
and phylogenetic characterization were not high, the data 
reinforce that multidrug plus serum resistant isolates have 
been introduced in the food-chain.
Taken together, our data indicate that commensal  E. 
coli strains isolated from the liver of poultry carcasses in 
Pernambuco-Brazil can harbor and potentially share multi-
drug- plus virulence genes found in pathogenic pathotypes. 
This suspicion was not related to specific phylogenetic 
groups or presence of the iss gene. Since, in the present stu-
dy, the lack of macroscopic alterations had not shown a clue 
about the presence of extraintestinal Eschereichia coli and/
or colibacillosis, the implementation of more rigorous food 
surveillance can potentially decrease the likelihood of food 
outbreaks.
