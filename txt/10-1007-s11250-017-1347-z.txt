Abstract Salmonellosis is a major bacterial disease causing
huge economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. This
study was carried out to determine the period prevalence and
antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella enterica in
Japanese quails in Abeokuta, Nigeria. Four hundred cloacal
swabs of quail birds were collected from 4 locations within
Abeokuta. Salmonella was isolated from the samples using
conventional methods for selective isolation of Salmonella
and biochemical identification. Isolates were confirmed by
polymerase chain reaction assays for the amplification and
detection of Salmonella-associated virulence genes (invA
and stn) using specific primers. Antimicrobial susceptibility
testing was done using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion meth-
od. In all, Salmonella was isolated from 14 (3.5%) cloacal
swabs. All 14 isolates possessed invA and stn genes. The
Salmonella isolates showed resistance to tetracycline
(100%), doxycycline (100%), ampicillin (100%),
sulphamethoxazole (92.9%), nalidixic acid (85.8%), ceftazi-
dime (78.6%), neomycin (64.3%), streptomycin (50%) and
gentamycin (28.6%) but all the isolates were susceptible to
ciprofloxacin. The isolates were resistant to at least three an-
timicrobials indicating multidrug resistance. The results con-
cluded that Japanese quails harbour multidrug-resistant

Salmonella which could be transmitted to humans through
consumption of contaminated food or by direct and indirect
contact with the carrier birds. Antimicrobial resistance could
be due to overdependence on antimicrobials. Ciprofloxacin
could be considered in the treatment of zoonotic
Salmonellosis in humans.

Introduction

With an estimated population put approximately 104.3 million,
poultry birds represent a major source of high-quality animal
protein in Nigeria (Ajala et al. 2007). Poultry production is a very
viable business in Nigeria with great potentials for growth and
income generation. The livestock industry in Nigeria provides
about 36.5% of the total protein intake of Nigerians and poultry
contributes substantially to this (UNDP 2006).

Over the years, there has been a significant gap between the
production and demand of animal protein to feed the ever grow-
ing population. To halt this negative trend, efforts are being di-
rected towards improving the livestock industry with the intro-
duction of micro-livestock possessing prolific tendency, short
gestation period, short generation interval and rapid growth
(Owen and Amakiri 2010). Among the micro-livestock animals
is the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica). Japanese
quails are hardy birds that thrive in small cages and are cheap
to produce. They have less feed requirement of about 20–25 g
feed per day compared to chicken that requires 120–130 g per
day (Ani et al. 2009). The Japanese quail attains market weight of
140–180 g between 5 and 8 weeks of age and have a high rate of
egg production between 180 and 250 per year (Shwartz and
Allen 1981; Garwood and Diehl 1987).

Salmonellosis is considered a major bacterial disease problem
in the poultry industry worldwide. Salmonella is one of the im-
portant inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract that causes
foodborne infection worldwide, resulting in millions of human
infections and annual deaths (Mead et al. 1999). Salmonella
enterica are carried by a wide range of food and wild animals,
rodents, pets, birds, reptiles and insects, usually showing no clin-
ical signs (Adams and Moss 1999). Most of the Salmonella
infections in humans’ results from the ingestion of contaminated
poultry and poultry products (Carli et al. 2001).

In humans and veterinary medical practices, the use of
antibiotics in the treatment of life-threatening bacterial dis-
eases has reduced mortality rates and improved productivity
especially in food animals over the past decades. But recently,
antibiotic resistance has become a serious public health and
food safety problem with the emergence of multidrug-resistant
bacterial species in man and animals. The worldwide increase
in the use of antibiotics, as an integral part of the poultry and
other livestock production especially for the treatment and
prevention of bacterial diseases and as growth promoter has
contributed to the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria in
recent years (Oluwasile et al. 2014). A recent report by the
Centre for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed
that antimicrobial susceptibility data on Salmonellae are
scarce in West Africa including Nigeria and as such treatment
of salmonellosis with appropriate antibiotics is not usually
done. This could encourage the development of multidrug
resistance among Salmonella serotypes (CDC 2015).

This study investigated the prevalence and antimicrobial
susceptibility of Salmonella in apparently healthy Japanese
quails reared in Abeokuta.

Materials and methods

Sample collection

Four hundred cloacal swabs were randomly sampled from
selected quail farms in Abeokuta, Ogun State. Samples were
collected aseptically using sterile swab sticks to scoop faeces
from the cloaca of the birds and placed in sterile universal
bottles. One hundred samples from two farms were collected
from each of the four different locations (Camp, Olomore,
Elega and Obantoko). Samples were transported in container
with ice packs to the laboratory for microbiological
examination.

Isolation and identification Salmonellae

Conventional methods for the detection of Salmonella were
carried out according to the procedure described by Davies
and Wray (1994). Briefly, each cloacal swab was pre-
enriched in 9 ml of buffered peptone water and incubated at

Trop Anim Health Prod

37 °C for 24 h. The pre-enrichment broth culture was mixed
and 1 ml was transferred with a sterile pipette into a tube
containing sterile 9 ml of Mueller-Kaufmann Tetrathionate
novobiocin (MKTTn) broth. Moreover, 0.1 ml of pre-
enrichment broth culture was transferred in drops onto 9 ml
of sterile Modified semi solid Rappaport Vassiliadis agar
(MSRV). Inoculated MKTTn broth was incubated at 37 °C
for 24 h and the MSRV was incubated at 41.5 °C for 24 h.
After incubation, a loop full of MKTTn and MSRV cultures
were streaked separately onto the surface of Xylose lysine
desoxycholate (XLD) agar and MacConkey agar (MAC).
The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation,
the plates were checked for growth of typical Salmonella col-
onies. Typical colonies of Salmonella grow on XLD agar with
a black centre and a lightly transparent zone of reddish colour
due to the colour change of indicator, while typical colonies of
Salmonella grows on MAC agar as pale translucent colonies
and slightly convex. Identification of suspected Salmonella
colonies was based on morphological, cultural and biochem-
ical tests as previously described (Barrow and Feltham 1995;
Shivaprasad 2000).

Molecular confirmation of Salmonellae

Genomic DNA was extracted from 1-ml overnight tryptic soy
broth culture of each isolate using the QIAamp ® DNA Mini
extraction kit (QIAGEN, USA). The extracted DNA was used
for the detection of stn (Salmonella enterotoxin), and inv. A
(invasive) gene by PCR analysis (Rahman 1999; Rahman
et al. 2000).

Primers used for stn gene were Stn P1 5-TTG TGT CGC
TAT CAC TGG CAA CC-3 (upper primer) and stn M13 5-
ATT CGT AAC CCG CTC TCG TCC-3 (lower primer)10
(GENSET, Singapore), which flank a 617 bp segment in the
stn gene sequence. The PCR mixture (25 μl) included 12.5 μl
master mix (QIAGEN, USA) containing 2.5 U Taq DNA
polymerase, 20 μM each of dATP, dCTP, dTTP and dGTP,
MgCl2 and PCR buffer, 5 μl (1 μM) each of upper and lower
primers and 2.5 μl of template DNA (from the isolate). PCR
reaction was performed in a thermocycler (Biorad, icycler) in
25 cycles of denaturation (94 °C for 1 min), primer annealing
(59 °C for 1 min) and primer extension (72 °C for 1 min)
followed by final elongation at 72 °C for 10 min.

For invA gene, the primers used were S139-5 GTG AAA
TTA TCG CCA CGT TCG GGC AA-3 (upper primer) and
S141-5 TCA TCG CAC CGT CAA AGG AAC C-3 (lower
primer). These primers flank a 284 bp segment in the invA
gene sequence. Reactions with these primers were carried out
in a 25 μl amplification mixture consisting of 12.5 μl of PCR
buffer, dNTPs (10 mM) and MgCl2 (50 mM), 5 μl of each
primer, 0.5 μl of Taq DNA polymerase (fermentase) and 2 μl
of extracted DNA (Soumet et al. 1999). The amplification
condition was as follows: an initial incubation at 95 °C for

Trop Anim Health Prod

5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 60 s,
annealing at 56 °C for 30 s, elongation at 72 °C for 30 s and
final extension period for 10 min at 72 °C.

Then, 15 μl aliquot of each PCR product was electropho-
retically separated on agarose gel (1%, containing 0.5 μl/ml
ethidium bromide, Pharmacia, Sweden) at 100 V for 1.5 h and
molecular size marker of 100 bp was added to the gel. It was
visualised under UV light (300 nm) from the transilluminator
and photographed using Gel doc 2000 documentation system
(Pharmacia, Sweden).

Antibiotic susceptibility testing

Antibiotic sensitivity test was conducted using antibiotic discs
(Oxoid, UK) according to Kirby-Bauer antibiotic disc diffu-
sion techniques. Briefly, Mueller-Hinton agar was prepared in
Petri-dishes. Pure colonies of the isolated organisms were re-
suscitated in normal saline and the turbidity matched against
0.5 McFarland turbidity standard. The bacteria were plated on
the Mueller-Hinton agar and antibiotic disc was placed cen-
trally using the antibiotic disc dispenser (Oxoid, UK). The
Petri-dish and its content were incubated for 18 h at 35 °C.
The organisms were observed for antibiotic sensitivity by
measuring the zone of inhibition on the plate (Baker and
Breach 1980).

Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics were used to describe the prevalence
analyses and antibiogram was presented in percentages.
Programs Excel version 2003 (Microsoft® Office Excel
2003) and Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS. 16)
were used for data collection, management and analysis.

Result

In this study, Salmonella was isolated from 14 (3.5%) out of
the total 400 cloacal samples examined as shown in (Table 1).
Camp has the highest prevalence of 6%, followed by Olomore
5%, Obantoko 3% while Salmonella was not detected in any
of the samples from Elega.

Antibiotic susceptibility of Salmonella isolates
from cloacal swabs of Japanese quails in Abeokuta

Antibiotic resistance rates of the 14 Salmonella isolates are
shown in (Table 2). The isolates were resistant to ampicillin
(100%), doxycycline (100%), tetracycline (100%),
sulphamethoxazole (92.9%), nalidixic acid (78.6%), ceftazi-
dime (78.6%), neomycin (71.4%), streptomycin (57.2%) and
gentamycin (21.4%). All isolates were susceptible to cipro-
floxacin. The isolates showed divergent resistance pattern
with most isolates showing resistance to at least four out of
the ten antibiotics tested (Table 3).

The 14 salmonella isolates were positive for invA and stn

genes by polymerase chain reaction method.

Discussion

In this study, 14 (3.5%) of 400 cloacal swab samples exam-
ined were positive for Salmonella. The 3.5% prevalence of
Salmonella observed in the cloacal swabs of Japanese quail
in this study was higher than 2.98% in Japanese quail in Iran
(Jahantigh et al. 2012) and 0% in Japanese quail in Brazil
(Teixeira et al. 2013) but lower than 9% in quail birds in
Egypt (Maysa et al. 2013). This may be due to the difference
in the geographical locations, lack of farms biosecurity mea-
sures, bad management practices as well as the ability of
Salmonella to survive on the wide range of animate and inan-
imate carriers. Salmonellosis remains a major foodborne dis-
ease in human. The significance of Salmonella spp. as the
aetiology of human and animal diseases has increased over
the years. Modern practices in the poultry industry are now
more favourable for the maintenance and dissemination of
Salmonella serotypes (Harsha et al. 2011).

In the present study, the resistance pattern of the 14
Salmonella isolates to the 10 antibiotics tested showed that

the bacteria have acquired resistance to most of the antibiotics.
This may be due to indiscriminate use of antibiotics in poultry
production that has provided selective pressure for the emer-
gence of drug-resistant bacteria associated with poultry
(Gunner et al. 2004). The Salmonella isolates in this study
were all resistant to tetracycline. This is similar to the reports
of Fashae et al. (2010) who observed 93% Salmonella resis-
tance to tetracycline in Ibadan, Oyo State but higher than the
55.26% resistance reported by Oyekunle et al. (2003) in
Salmonella isolates from Yewa division of Ogun State.
Thus, it appears there is an increased trend in salmonellae
resistance to tetracycline over time within the same geograph-
ical location. Jones and Ricke (2003) reported that in Nigeria,
tetracycline is often administered in poultry as prophylaxis,
growth promoter or for the treatment of infections all through
life. There is evidence to indicate that tetracycline has bioac-
cumulation action compared to other antibiotics, which may
be critical in maintaining the tetracycline resistance at a high
level (Frost 1991). Antibiotics (including the tetracyclines) are
administered usually during the first few days of life and oc-
casionally when mortality occurs. Hence, poultry birds are
exposed to tetracyclines especially chlortetracycline and oxy-
tetracycline from day-old up to slaughter stage.

In this study, the salmonellae were 100% susceptible to
ciprofloxacin, which is a member of the fluoroquinolones.
This finding disagrees with the report of Harsha et al. (2011)
who observed 16.6% resistance of Salmonella isolates to cip-
rofloxacin from laying birds but agrees with the reports of
Singh and Gupta (1999) who observed considerable variation
in the resistance pattern of different isolates of Salmonella
with 100% sensitivity to ciprofloxacin. This high susceptibil-
ity may imply that the salmonellae have not acquired the re-
sistance to fluoroquinolones. Moreover, this drug is rarely
used in the treatment of infections in quail birds, unlike in

Trop Anim Health Prod

commercial chickens where the drug has been used frequently
in the treatment of salmonellosis and other bacterial infections
(Fashae et al. 2010). This also means that ciprofloxacin may
be a good drug of choice for the treatment of infections caused
by salmonellae provided it is adminisered judiciously only
when absolutely needed.

Carramiñana et al. (2004) observed 96.2% sulfadiazine re-
sistance in Salmonella originating from poultry slaughter-
house in Spain similar to the 92.9% resistance to
sulphamethoxazole observed in this study. However, Fashae
et al. (2010) observed a relatively lower Salmonellae resis-
tance of 87% to sulphamethoxazole. Resistance to
sulphamethoxazole may have resulted from selective pressure
resulting from the use of sulfaquinoxaline (a closely related
sulphonamide) in combination with amprolium (anticoccidial
drug) as a broad-spectrum anticoccidial drug. This drug com-
bination is marketed commercially (e.g. embarcine forte®)
and is probably the commonest drug in the study area for the
prevention and control of coccidiosis in poultry birds includ-
ing quails.

The 85.8% resistance to nalidixic acid observed in this
study is higher than 20% resistance in salmonella from quails
in Egypt (Ashraf et al. 2015) and 11.11% in salmonellae from
quail eggs in India (Harsha et al. 2011). This drug is a first-
generation quinolones that is very effective in the treatment of
infections in both man and animals and has been used in
monitoring the degree of resistance to fluoroquinolones
(Ackers et al. 2000). The high resistance observed in this
study may be due to a step-wise progression from low-level
to high-level resistance which occurs in bacteria through se-
quential mutations in chromosomes (Schneiders et al. 2003).
Salmonellae and other Enterobacteriaceae have evolved in-
creasing resistance to fluoroquinolones, as a result of muta-
tions in the target enzymes (topoisomerases) and an increase
in the expression of membrane proteins that pump the drugs
out of the cells (Wang et al. 2001). There was 21.4% resistance
to gentamycin, an aminoglycoside commonly used in the
treatment of bacterial infections. This is higher than the 0%
resistance to gentamycin in salmonellae from quail eggs re-
ported in India (Harsha et al. 2011) and 16% in salmonellae
from chickens in Nigeria (Ike et al. 2014) but lower than 100%
in salmonellae from humans in Kogi State, Nigeria (Sule et al.
2012).

The high resistance of 78.6% to ceftazidime (a third-
generation cephalosporins) observed in this study was higher
than 0% resistance reported in quail reared in Egypt (Ashraf
et al. 2015). Cephalosporins are members of an important
class of antibacterial agents (beta lactams) used in the treat-
ment of serious salmonellosis in both humans and animals
(Cavaco et al. 2008). The use of cephalosporins in food-
producing animals could be a selective factor for the appear-
ance of extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL)-producing
and multiple-antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in animals

Trop Anim Health Prod

(Cavaco et al. 2008). A close attention should be given to the
members of Enterobacteriaceae as they pose threat to human
health (Okesola and Makanjuola 2009). Salmonella are
among the notable bacteria known to carry plasmids, which
encode for drug resistance. This implies that widespread use
of antimicrobials in animals or humans may cause an increase
in the frequency of occurrence of bacteria resistant to other
antimicrobials as the resistance (R) plasmid may encode resis-
tance to additional antimicrobial agents (Molla et al. 2003).
There are several reports on the trend of infection through
faeces, suggesting that Salmonella species and Escherichia
coli are the main carriers of antimicrobial resistance genes in
faecal flora of animals and human (Carattoli 2003; Helms
et al. 2005; Osman et al. 2006).

Resistance genes are often located on extra-chromosomal
genetic elements or in segments inserted within the chromo-
some that originates from other genomes (Carattoli 2003; Yah
et al. 2007). The acquisition of a new gene may occur by
genetic transformation or through mobilization by conjugative
transfer. The latter may occur at high frequency and efficiency,
and several resistance genes can be acquired simultaneously
(Carattoli 2003). According to Carattoli (2003) and Yah et al.
(2007), the antibiotic resistance in those isolates which seem
not to possess plasmids was associated with chromosome and/
or transposons instead of being plasmid-mediated. The trans-
ferred plasmids DNA varied among the Salmonella species.
The exchange of plasmid(s) between bacterial cells and the
integration of resistance genes into specialized genetic ele-
ments play a major role in acquisition and dissemination of
antibiotic resistance genes among the Salmonella species
(Winokur et al. 2000; Carattoli 2003; Helms et al. 2004;
Osman et al. 2006; Yah et al. 2007).

In this study, the 14 Salmonella isolates were all positive
for the invA gene tested which correlates with the phenotypic
findings (appearance on selective medium and biochemical
tests). This gene which is specific for Salmonella chromosom-
ally located aids attachment of the pathogen to the epithelial
cells allowing for the penetration of the host cells leading to
spread and destruction of those cells (Rahman et al. 2000).

The 14 Salmonella isolates were also positive for stn
(Salmonella enterotoxin) gene. Salmonella-induced diarrhoea
is a complex phenomenon involving several pathogenic
mechanisms including production of enterotoxin (Rahman
et al. 2000). This enterotoxin production is mediated by the
stn gene. This factor is important in the pathogenicity of
salmonellae.

Most of poultry farmers in the study locations have been
administering antibiotics to their quails indiscriminately with-
out veterinary supervision. The availability of chickens in the
same farms with quails could also promote transmission of
Salmonella from chickens to quail or vice versa. It was ob-
served that the same farm attendants are involved in caring
(feeding, watering and other cares) for both the chickens and

quails on these farms. Thus, the attendants may acts as a ve-
hicle for the transmission of Salmonella between the two spe-
cies of birds.

Conclusion

The prevalence of multidrug-resistant Salmonella in Japanese
quails reared in Abeokuta poses public health risk. This is of
serious concerns in that the antibiotic options available for
treatment is being limited and narrowed. Moreover, it could
be speculated that bacteria will eventually acquire resistance
to the antibiotics to which they are currently susceptible if the
excessively and indiscriminately use are not restricted by strict
regulations and enforcement. The prophylactic use of many
antimicrobials in poultry feed can also lead to acquired anti-
biotic resistance. Strict hygiene, good management practices
and judicious use of antibiotics are possible ways of
preventing diseases and emergence of multidrug-resistant
bacteria.
