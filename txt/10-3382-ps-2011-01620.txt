  ABSTRACT   This study aims at identifying serotypes 
and surveying the antimicrobial resistance and plasmid 
support of resistance of 100 Salmonella strains, which 
were isolated from 96 out of 506 (18.97%) samples tak-
en from different production farms in the wilayas (i.e., 
Algerian  states)  of  Tizi-Ouzou,  Bouira,  Bejaïa,  and 
Boumerdes in 2007. The highest percentage of Salmo-
nella (48%) was recorded in Bouira. Thirteen serotypes 
were identified among the 100 Salmonella strains used 
in this study. The most prevalent ones were Salmonella
Heidelberg  (24%),  Salmonella  Enteritidis  (20%),  Sal-
monella  Albany  (16%),  and  Salmonella  Typhimurium 
(9%). The strains showed resistance to 8 of the 34 an-
tibiotics tested. Fifty-three percent of strains were re-
sistant to at least one antibiotic, among which 15.09% 
were multiresistant. The most frequently observed resis-
tance was to quinolones (58.49%), with a contribution 

of  94.74%  of  Salmonella  Heidelberg  resistant  strains. 
The plasmid transfer performed on 53 strains showed 
that  only  11  exhibited  one  or  more  markers  of  resis-
tance, the most frequent being ampicillin, followed by 
tetracycline,  then  cotrimoxazole,  sulphonamides,  and 
kanamycin, in that order. The tetracycline characteris-
tics were present in 72.72% of transconjugants, those of 
the β-lactams and sulphonamides in 27.27% each and 
those  of  the  aminosides  in  9.09%.  The  incompatibil-
ity groups of plasmids belong to the F1me and Com1 
classes, and the molecular weight of the plasmid DNA 
was greater than 100 kb. The phenotypic and genotyp-
ic results indicate a clonal dissemination in the Gallus 
gallus species in this particular study; this phenomenon 
could generate resistant bacteria and transferable genes 
of resistance to humans.   

  INTRODUCTION 

  The production and consumption of poultry has in-
creased  considerably  worldwide.  Poultry  production 
has left the farmyard and is now industrialized and con-
ducted in a more rational manner (Delpech, 1992). In 
Algeria, since the 1980s, the emergence of the poultry 
industries increased the consumption of animal proteins 
at a much affordable cost (Ferrah et al., 2003). Poul-
try represents one of the main reservoirs of Salmonella
that are responsible for a major zoonosis with serious 
economic  and  public  health  consequences  (Brisabois, 
2001).  Antimicrobial  agents  played  a  dominant  role 
for the treatment and the control of the salmonellosis. 
Their  overconsumption  contributed  to  the  emergence 
of  resistances.  In  fact,  despite  the  decrease  of  salmo-
nellosis  incidence  in  the  world,  multiresistant  strains

appeared in humans and became increasingly alarming 
in  both  industrialized  and  developing  countries  (Bri-
sabois,  2001).  The  surveillance  of  the  current  bacte-
rial resistances should not be exclusively based on the 
determination of the resistant phenotypes. The genetic 
characterization  by  conjugation  is  currently  the  most 
used  tool  in  Algeria  to  better  understand  the  spread 
of  antibiotic  resistance  in  zoonotic  bacteria,  until  the 
introduction of molecular biology techniques. 

  Our objectives were the phenotypic characterization 
of 100 Salmonella strains by determining the circulating 
serotypes  in  the  study’s  area,  the  antimicrobial  resis-
tance profiles, as well as the genotypic characterization. 

  MATERIALS AND METHODS 

  Sampling 

  As part of official control of poultry in 4 wilayas of 
Algeria, from January to December 2007, 100 Salmo-
nella strains were isolated from 506 avian samples dur-
ing autopsies of slain live subjects. This was conducted

Isolation and Identification  
of Salmonella Strains

The NF U 47–100/2007 (Afnor, 2007) standard meth-
od was adopted for the isolation and the biochemical 
and serological identification of Salmonella. The sero-
typing was carried out at the enterobacteria service of 
the Institut Pasteur of Algeria, using Salmonella anti-
serums anti-O and anti-H (BioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, 
France).

Antimicrobial Sensitivity Testing

The phenotypic study of the antimicrobial resistance 
was performed at the Bacteriology and Antibiotherapy 
Department of the Institut Pasteur of Algeria. Thirty-
four antimicrobial agents of 9 different chemical classes 
were  used:  ampicillin  (10  μg),  amoxicillin/clavulanic 
acid (20 μg/10 μg), mecillinam (10 μg), ticarcillin (75 
μg),  piperacillin  (100  μg),  latamoxef  (30  μg),  imepe-
nem (10 μg), aztreonam (30 μg), cefazolin (30 μg), ce-
falexin (30 μg), cefoxitin (30 μg), ceftazidim (30 μg), 
cefepim (30 μg), cefuroxim (30 μg), cefotaxim (30 μg), 
to ceftiofur (30 μg), cephalotin (30 μg), gentamicin (10 
μg), amikacin (30 μg), netilmicin (30 μg), kanamycin 
(30 μg), isepamicin (30 μg), nitrofurantoїne (300 μg), 
nalidixic acid (30 μg), ciprofloxacin (5 μg), enrofloxa-
cin  (5  μg),  levofloxacin  (5  μg),  tetracyclines  (30  μg), 
chloramphenicol  (30  μg),  sulphonamides  (300  μg), 
trimethoprim  (5  μg),  trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 
(1.25  μg/23.75  μg),  colistin  (10  μg),  and  fosfomycin 
(200 μg; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Micrograms indicates 
the antibiotic load in one disk; the unit of this load (ex-
pressed in micrograms) for each antibiotic used for each 
bacterial species is specified by the supplier (Bio-Rad). 
The minimum inhibitory concentration was established 
using the E-test (AB-Biodisk). Escherichia coli ATCC 
25922 (Institut Pasteur Paris, Paris, France) was used 
for the control antibiograms. The method adopted for 
the  study  of  the  antimicrobial  resistance  is  based  on 
the diffusion in Mueller-Hinton agar media as described 
by Kirby-Bauer and interpreted according to the Clini-
cal Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, 2001) guide-
lines,  which  are  recommended  by  the  World  Health 
Organization (WHO, 1999). In our study, the multire-
sistant strains are the ones that confer a resistance to 
2 or more antimicrobials. The study of genetic support 
required the use of antimicrobial powders: tetracycline 
(Sigma,  Woodstock,  VA),  nalidixic  acid  (Serva,  Hei-
delberg,  Germany),  rifampicin  (Life-pharmacy,  Tuen 
Mun,  Hong  Kong,  China),  nitrofurantoїnes  (Saïdal, 
Annaba,  Algeria),  kanamycin  (Bristol-Meyers  Squibb, 
New York, NY), trimethoprim (Roche, Basel, Switzer-
land),  injectable  sodic  ampicillin  (Biopharm,  Bothell, 
WA), chloramphenicol sodic ampicillin (Serva Peinbio-
chemica). Also, several reference strains and plasmids 

were  used  (Institut  Pasteur  Paris):  Escherichia  coli 
K12Nal (nalidixic acid resistance) and Escherichia coli 
C600Rif (rifampicin resistance) for the plasmid trans-
fer  by  conjugation  and  Com1  (K)  Rif,  Com1  PPED 
178 (ACTp) Rif, F1me PPED 181/4(T) Nal, and F1me 
PPED  181/3(CTp)  Rif  for  the  compatibility  test,  as 
well as the DNA of the λ phage digested by the Hind 
III enzyme as a reference to determine the size of the 
plasmids.  The  genetic  transfer  by  conjugation  that 
was used for the detection of plasmids carrying the re-
sistance  characters  was  described  by  Courvalin  et  al. 
(1985). After streaking on agar bromocresol purple and 
18 to 24 h of incubation at 35°C, a colony of the studied 
donor strain and that of the recipient reference strain 
were individually inoculated in buffered glucose broth. 
After shaking for 4 h in a water bath at 35°C, 1 mL of 
each culture was mixed with a rake on Mueller-Hinton 
agar and incubated for 18 h at 35°C. One milliliter of 
buffered glucose broth was added, and then the super-
natant was recovered after mixing. Moreover, 1 mL of 
an antibiotic for the suspected plasmidic character for 
the  donor  strain  and  1  mL  of  another  antibiotic  for 
the suspected chromosomal character for the receiving 
strain  were  added  to  18  mL  of  Mueller-Hinton  agar. 
The final concentrations of the antibiotics used are Fu-
rans, 300 μg/mL; TCY, 33 μg/mL; ampicillin, 200 μg/
mL; kanamycine, 25 μg/mL; Nal, 100 μg/mL; TMP, 20 
μg/mL; CCC, 25 μg/mL. A quarter of a Petri dish was 
seeded in lines by the 2 strains and the 3/4 remaining 
were streaked by the supernatant (mixture of these 2 
strains). After 18 h of incubation at 35°C, the appear-
ance of colonies on the part inoculated with the super-
natant indicates the presence of the transconjugants.

The resulting transconjugants were tested to deter-
mine their resistance profiles and therefore their trans-
ferable characteristics. To determine the major incom-
patibility groups of plasmids the used test was the same 
as for the genetic transfer; it required a cross between 
a transconjugant and E. coli carrying a plasmid refer-
ence. The plasmids were extracted from the transferred 
strains  and  their  transconjugants,  using  the  alkaline 
lyse technique (Kado and Liu, 1981), and the plasmid 
profiles were determined by separating the plasmids ex-
tracted on agarose gel.

RESULTS

Nineteen percent of the total samples were positive 
for Salmonella. The distribution of Salmonella per wila-
ya showed 48% of cases from Bouira, 21% from Bejaïa, 
16% from Boumerdes, and 15% from Tizi-Ouzou. Thir-
teen  different  serotypes  were  identified,  among  which 
Salmonella Heidelberg was the most prevalent (24%). 
Salmonella  Heidelberg,  Salmonella  Enteritidis,  Salmo-
nella  Albany,  Salmonella  Infantis,  Salmonella  Block-
ley, and Salmonella Livingstone were present in all the 
wilayas.  Besides,  Salmonella  Enteritidis  prevailed  in 
Bouira, Salmonella Albany in Bejaïa and Tizi-Ouzou, 
and  Salmonella  Heidelberg  in  Boumerdes  (Table  1). 

ANTIBIOGRAM AND PLASMID PROFILES OF SALMONELLA

1181

The  study  of  the  antimicrobial  resistance  performed 
on  100  Salmonella  strains  revealed  a  resistance  to  8 
of  them  from  6  different  classes.  Fifty-three  percent 
of  the  strains  showed  resistance  to  at  least  one  anti-
microbial,  among  which  15.09%  were  multiresistant. 
Forty-seven  percent  of  strains  were  susceptible  to  all 
antimicrobials tested. The resistance to quinolones was 
the most frequent (58.49%) and included 94.74% of the 
resistant strains of the prevalent serotype in our study 
(Table  2).  The  plasmid  transfer  assay  was  performed 
on 53 strains with resistance to β-lactams (4%), ami-
noglycosides (2%), tetracyclines (15%), sulphonamides 
(13%), nitrofurans (19%), and to quinolones (47%). In 
total, 11 strains have transferred one or several resis-
tance markers, of which the most frequent were ampi-
cillin, tetracycline, cotrimoxazole, sulphonamides, and 
kanamycin. The tetracycline character was present in 
72.72% of transconjugants, those of the sulphonamides 
and  β-lactams  in  27.27%  each,  and  that  of  the  ami-
noglycosides in 9.09%. The compatibility test revealed 
incompatibility groups of plasmids in Com1 and F1me 
classes (Table 3). The plasmid DNA analysis resulted 
in a molecular weight that is greater than 100 kb (Fig-
ure 1).

DISCUSSION

Geographical Distribution  
of Salmonella Serotypes

Bouira  was  characterized  by  the  most  important 
number of isolated strains because most avian samples 
were from this region, which has more than one-thou-
sand poultry farms. Salmonella Heidelberg prevailed in 
our  study.  Our  results  were  supported  by  the  study 
of  Barnhart  et  al.  (1991)  in  Northern  Ireland,  on  42 
poultry samples (56.5%), and that of Mammina et al. 
(2003) in Italy, on laying hens and the environment of 
chicken  farms  (20.3%).  Whereas  in  a  national  study, 

Salmonella Heidelberg represents only 1.81% (Elgroud 
et al., 2009). This serotype is among the 3 most com-
mon cases of human salmonellosis in Canada and one 
of the 5 most prevalent in the USA, according to the 
Canadian  integrated  program  for  monitoring  of  the 
antimicrobial resistance (PICRA, 2006). According to 
this program, international comparisons of human data 
from 2000 to 2004 indicated that Salmonella Heidelberg 
was  more  common  in  North  America,  whereas  Mam-
mina et al. (2003) have shown that this serotype was 
responsible  for  only  a  small  proportion  of  human  in-
fection in Italy. According to Usera et al. (1999) and 
the report of the European Community (EFSA, 2007), 
Salmonella Enteritidis was the most frequently report-
ed, with prevalences of 46.1 and 42%, respectively, and 
these are higher than those we have recorded. Our pres-
ent result is higher than that recorded by Elgroud et 
al. (2008; 3.63%). The isolation frequency of Salmonella 
Infantis and Salmonella Albany was comparable to that 
given in Austria by Berghold and Kornschober (2002). 
Similarly,  the  rate  that  we  recorded  for  Salmonella 
Typhimurium was comparable to that reported by El-
groud et al. (2009) and by Van Immerseel et al. (2005) 
in poultry farms in Europe between 1991 and 2000 but 
higher than that noted by these same authors in 2003. 
The registered prevalence for Salmonella Blockley was 
lower  than  that  found  in  Saudi  Arabia  (al-Nakhli  et 
al.,  1999).  Salmonella  Hadar,  identified  in  5%  of  our 
strains, was the predominant serotype in Italy (Uytten-
daele et al., 1998) and Senegal (Cardinale et al., 2005). 
Salmonella  Pullorum,  which  has  no  impact  on  public 
health, as related to host species has been eradicated 
from poultry farms in several developed countries, such 
as the USA and Canada. The declaration of pullorosis 
in our farms could cause major economic losses, such as 
those observed from the thirties to the sixties (Villate, 
2001). In our study, Salmonella Newport and Salmonel-
la Montevideo were isolated with a very low prevalence. 
These results are corroborated by the study of Elgroud

sure eliminates the susceptible bacteria and promotes 
the  growth  of  resistant  strains  (Jaecklin,  2002;  Fluit, 
2005). Even though the treatment of avian salmonel-
losis is banned in Algeria by ministerial order (JORA, 
2003), the high rate of antimicrobial resistance that we 
recorded (53%) could be explained by the indiscrimi-
nate  use  of  these  drugs  for  therapeutic,  prophylactic 
purposes or as growth promoters. Our result was sig-
nificantly higher than that reported by Al-Bahry et al. 
(2007; 23.7%) and lower than that recorded by Elgroud 
et  al.  (2008;  80%)  and  that  reported  by  the  PICRA 
(2006; 63%). Multidrug resistance observed in our study 
was also described by Bornert (2000) and Al-Bahry et 
al. (2007). Moreover, resistance was found for 6 of the 
9 antimicrobial classes tested. The observed resistance 
to first generation quinolones (nalidixic acid) was the 
most frequent. This is likely due to their repeated use in 
poultry production. Fortunately, there is no resistance 
to fluoroquinolones tested (ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, 
levofloxacin)  as  reported  by  Mc  Kenzie  and  Nadeau 
(2006). These results corroborate several international 
studies (Heurtin-Le Corre et al. 1999; San Martin et al., 
2005; PICRA, 2006). Salmonella isolates were found to 
be resistant to ciprofloxacin in previous French (Brisa-
bois et al., 1997) and Algerian studies (Elgroud et al., 
2009; Bouzidi et al., 2011), which is more worrying as 
fluoroquinolones should be reserved for the treatment 
of invasive human salmonellosis (Davies et al., 1999). 
Although furans have been removed from the Algerian 
nomenclature, we recorded a high rate of resistance to 
nitrofurantoїnes. This result was lower than that not-
ed in 2004 in Poland by Wasyl and Hoszowski (2004; 
48.2%). The rates of resistance to cyclines reported by 
several authors were higher than those we recorded and 
ranged  from  20  to  91%  (Brisabois  et  al.,  1997;  Dinh 
Nam Lâm et al., 2000; Mc Kenzie and Nadeau, 2006; 
PICRA,  2006).  As  for  sulphonamides,  our  result  was 
higher  than  that  reported  by  the  national  monitor-
ing  network  to  antimicrobial  resistance  (7%;  Aboun, 
2005)  and  lower  than  that  noted  by  Brisabois  et  al.

et  al.  (2009)  but  refuted  by  those  of  Uyttendaele  et 
al.  (1998)  in  Belgium  and  Foley  et  al.  (2008)  in  the 
USA, who have ranked it among the 6 most common 
serotypes. The study of the distribution of Salmonella 
serotypes  within  4  wilayas  taught  us  about  their  dy-
namic expansion across the adjacent wilayas, or even 
their possible spread in the national territory. Bouira 
was the wilaya that counted most of the serotypes, with 
a high prevalence of Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella 
Heidelberg, and Salmonella Typhimurium. Bejaïa had 
less  diversity  than  that  recorded  in  Bouira;  the  pre-
dominant  serotypes  were  Salmonella  Albany,  Salmo-
nella  Heidelberg,  and  Salmonella  Infantis.  Although 
Tizi-Ouzou and Boumerdes had only 15 and 16 strains, 
diversity was observed with a predominance of Salmo-
nella  Albany  and  Salmonella  Heidelberg,  respectively. 
The  homogeneous  distribution  of  all  serotypes  in  the 
study’s  area  could  be  the  consequence  of  the  uncon-
trolled movement of poultry products.

Resistance of Antimicrobial Agents Tested

There is a positive correlation between antimicrobial 
use  and  bacterial  resistance  rates;  indeed,  each  expo-

(1997; 88%). Resistance to β-lactams involved ampicil-
lin only; our result was lower than those reported by 
Mc Kenzie and Nadeau (2006), Al-Bahry et al. (2007), 
and Dinh Nam Lâm et al. (2000), which were between 
36 and 88.89%. Acquired resistance to aminoglycosides 
is  not  common  in  Enterobacteriaceae  (Courvalin  and 
Philippon, 1989); the only restraint in our study was 
resistance  to  kanamycin,  although  this  antimicrobial 
agent is not used in poultry. Our result, probably due 
to  the  cross  resistance  with  neomycin,  was  in  agree-
ment  with  those  obtained  by  Brisabois  et  al.  (1997), 
Millemann (1998), Dinh Nam Lâm et al. (2000), and 
Mc  Kenzie  and  Nadeau  (2006).  The  susceptibility  to 
polypeptides was confirmed by Aboun (2005); on the 
other hand, the susceptibility to chloramphenicol was 
reversed by Brisabois et al. (1997), Dinh Nam Lâm et 
al. (2000), and Al-Bahry et al. (2007), who noted 91, 
25,  and  14%  resistance  rates,  respectively.  Out  of  24 
Salmonella Heidelberg strains tested, only 5 were sus-
ceptible  to  all  antimicrobials  used.  The  19  remaining 
were mostly resistant to nalidixic acid. In Canada, this 
serotype  would  be  particularly  resistant  to  the  third 
generation  cephalosporins  (PICRA,  2006).  The  resis-
tance of Salmonella Enteritidis to furans was confirmed 
by the results of Espigares et al. (2006). In our study, 
Salmonella Typhimurium was resistant to quinolones, 
furans,  cyclones,  and  sulphonamides.  This  multidrug 
resistance  could  facilitate  the  spread  of  this  serotype 
and the development of other mechanisms of resistance 
to other antimicrobial classes. Indeed, in the literature, 
Salmonella  Typhimurium  was  resistant  to  several  an-
timicrobial agents with a special surge of resistance to 
nalidixic acid (Brisabois et al. 1997; Heurtin-Le Corre 
et al., 1999). Salmonella Hadar, resistant to quinolones 
and tetracycline, was multiresistant in the study of Es-
pigares et al. (2006).

Genetic Support of Resistance

The Salmonella strains resistant to nalidixic acid and 
nitrofurantoїnes were not transferable, confirming the 
chromosomal support of these resistances. The major-
ity  of  resistance  markers  were  transferred;  the  most 
common  were  ampicillin,  tetracycline,  cotrimoxazole, 
sulphonamides, and kanamycin. In our study, a plasmid 
grouping identified the same classes (Com1 and F1me) 
as described by Chaslus-Dancla (1980) in France and 
found in a national study on enterobacteria isolated in 
western Algeria (Barka, 2002). The results obtained by 
physical analysis of plasmid content of transconjugants 
implied that the spread of resistance characteristics of 
studied Salmonella strains is provided by high molecu-
lar weight plasmids. This study allowed us to highlight 
diverse serotypes, with a predominance of Salmonella 
Heidelberg. The free flow of the same Salmonella sero-
types and the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance 
and plasmid groups, observed in a limited area of study, 
is an alarming reality. The fight against avian salmo-
nellosis requires the application of control measures at 

various  levels  of  the  production  chain.  It  would  also 
require the development of an effective plan of epide-
miological surveillance, and for this, similar and com-
plementary studies must be conducted in Algeria and 
will include the identification of different phage types 
and  their  distribution,  monitoring  the  geographical 
spread and resistance evolution of identified serotypes, 
the spread of resistant Salmonella strains from animals 
to humans, and the identification of resistance genes. 
The use of different techniques in molecular biology is 
essential, particularly those based on the analysis of the 
restriction pattern of plasmids should be generalized.
