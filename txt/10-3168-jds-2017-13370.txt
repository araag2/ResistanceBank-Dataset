ABSTRACT

Staphylococcus aureus is one of the main pathogens 
involved  in  dairy  cow  mastitis.  Monitoring  of  antibi-
otic use would prove useful to assess the risk of Staph. 
aureus  in  raw  milk.  The  objective  of  this  work  was 
to  investigate  the  prevalence  of  Staph.  aureus  strains 
isolated from raw milk in northern China, and to char-
acterize  antimicrobial  susceptibility  of  these  strains 
and  their  key  virulence  genes.  In  total,  195  raw  milk 
samples  were  collected  from  195  dairy  farms  located 
in 4 cities of northern China from May to September 
2015. Out of 195 samples, 54 (27.7%) were positive for 
Staph. aureus. Among these 54 samples, 54 strains of 
Staph. aureus were isolated, and 16 strains were identi-
fied as methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus. The strains 
exhibited high percentages of resistance to penicillin G 
(85.2%), ampicillin (79.6%), and erythromycin (46.3%). 
Moreover,  72%  of  the  strains  showed  resistance  to 
more  than  one  antimicrobial  agent.  Overall,  63%  of 
penicillin-resistant strains possessed the blaZ gene, and 
60%  of  the  erythromycin-resistant  strains  possessed 
erm(A),  erm(B),  erm(C),  msr(A),  or  msr(B)  genes 
with  8  different  gene  patterns.  All  isolates  resistant 
to  gentamicin,  kanamycin,  and  oxacillin  carried  the 
aac6’-aph2”, ant(4’)-Ia, and mecA genes, respectively. 
Two  tet(M)-positive  isolates  carried  specific  genes  of 
the Tn916-Tn1545 transposon. The most predominant 
virulence  genes  were  sec,  sea,  and  pvl,  which  encode 
staphylococcal enterotoxins (sec and sea) and Panton-
Valentine  leukocidin,  respectively.  Thirty-two  isolates 
(59.2%)  harbored  one  or  more  virulence  genes.  The 
majority of Staph. aureus strains were multidrug resis-
tant and carried multiple virulence genes, which may 
pose a risk to public health. Our data indicated that

antimicrobial resistance of Staph. aureus was prevalent 
in dairy herds in northern China, and that antibiotics, 
especially penicillin G and ampicillin, to treat mastitis 
caused by Staph. aureus should be used with caution in 
northern China.

INTRODUCTION

 

Staphylococcus aureus is one of the main pathogens 
involved in dairy cow and goat mastitis worldwide, and 
it is an important opportunistic pathogen in raw milk 
(Cavicchioli et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016). Staphylo-
coccus aureus IMI results in significant economic losses 
due to reduced milk production and poor milk quality 
(Stapels et al., 2014), and Staph. aureus infections are 
related  to  the  expression  of  virulence  factors.  Many 
virulence factors have been found in Staph. aureus iso-
lated from bovine mastitis, including toxic shock syn-
drome toxin-1 (TSST-1), enterotoxins, enterotoxin-like 
exfoliative toxin, and Panton-Valentine leukocidin (Kot 
et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016). These virulence factors 
are  highly  stable  to  heat  or  proteolytic  enzymes  and 
help bacteria to survive and multiply in the mammary 
gland (de Freitas Guimarães et al., 2013).

Antimicrobial therapy is an important tool in masti-
tis control programs, but Staph. aureus responds poorly 
to therapy with antimicrobial agents (Gomes and Hen-
riques, 2016). Staphylococcus aureus is a pathogen with 
a remarkable ability to withstand antimicrobial agents 
and evade the human immune system. By recognizing 
the  resistance  mechanisms  of  Staph.  aureus,  effective 
measures  in  mastitis  control  programs  can  be  estab-
lished. Intrinsic resistance and acquired resistance have 
been shown to contribute to the ability of Staph. aureus 
to  survive  specific  antimicrobial  stress  (Baym  et  al., 
2016). It possesses numerous intrinsic factors that limit 
the effectiveness of specific antimicrobial agents (Raja-
gopal et al., 2016) and can develop acquired resistance 
to many other antimicrobial agents by carrying various 

2

resistance traits on plasmids or transposons (Chajecka-
Wierzchowska et al., 2015). Acquired antimicrobial re-
sistance has a transmission potential to humans (Ruegg 
et al., 2015). Therefore, monitoring antimicrobial resis-
tance in Staph. aureus from raw milk is very important 
in order to predict the rate and type of antimicrobial 
resistance development and to make decisions regard-
ing antibiotic treatments of animals from a food safety 
standpoint.

Studies  of  antimicrobial  resistance  and  virulence 
traits  in  Staph.  aureus  have  been  performed  in  milk 
of bovines with mastitis in several countries, including 
Turkey,  Brazil,  Iran,  and  India,  as  well  as  the  mid-
east of China (Gundogan and Avci, 2014; Cavicchioli 
et  al.,  2015;  Jamali  et  al.,  2015;  Mistry  et  al.,  2016; 
Zhang et al., 2016). However, reports on the incidence 
of  antimicrobial  resistance  of  Staph.  aureus  from  raw 
milk in dairy herds in northern China are very limited. 
Continuous monitoring of antimicrobial resistance and 
virulence  profiles  of  Staph.  aureus  could  be  useful  to 
assess the risk of Staph. aureus in raw milk in north-
ern  China.  Therefore,  the  objective  of  this  work  was 
to  investigate  the  prevalence  of  Staph.  aureus  strains 
isolated from dairy herds in northern China from May 

to  September  2015,  and  to  characterize  these  strains 
by antimicrobial susceptibility and key virulence genes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Collection of Samples

A total of 195 raw milk samples were collected from 
195 dairy farms located in major dairy-production cities 
of northern China (herd size ≥300, milking frequency 
2–3  times  per  day,  no  clinical  mastitis)  from  May  to 
September  2015  (average  daily  temperature  >20°C). 
We  collected  75  samples  from  Hohhot,  50  from  Bei-
jing, 40 from Harbin, and 30 from Jinan (Figure 1). All 
samples were collected from the milk tank, transferred 
into  sterile  bottles,  and  transported  immediately  to 
laboratory at 4°C for bacteriological analysis.

Isolation and Identification of Staph. aureus

For  isolation  and  detection  of  Staph.  aureus,  each 
sample (10 mL) was added to 90 mL of sterile peptone 
water and homogenized. The samples were placed onto 
Baird-Parker agar supplemented with 5% egg yolk and

tellurite (Beijing Land Bridge Technology Ltd., Beijing, 
China).  The  plates  were  incubated  for  24  to  48  h  at 
37°C. Colonies with typical black appearance and sur-
rounded  by  a  clear  zone  were  enumerated  as  Staph. 
aureus.

Molecular Characterization of Staph. aureus

Presumptive colonies were confirmed by PCR detec-
tion (Bio-Rad S1000, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, 
CA) of the Staph. aureus-specific thermonuclease gene 
(nuc; Supplemental Table S1, https:// doi .org/ 10 .3168/ 
jds .2017 -13370). All isolates were stored at −80°C until 
use.

Genomic DNA of the Staph. aureus isolates was ex-
tracted using the InstaGene Matrix DNA extraction kit 
(Bio-Rad  Laboratories)  following  the  manufacturer’s 
instructions.  The  PCR  reactions  were  performed  us-
ing the EmeraldAmp Max PCR Master Mix kit (Ta-
kara, Dalian, China) and followed the manufacturer’s 
instructions.  Briefly,  25-μL  reactions  were  prepared, 
containing  12.5  μL  of  2×  EmeraldAmp  Max  PCR 
Master Mix kit (Takara), 1 μL of extracted DNA, 10 
pmol  of  each  primer,  and  ultrapure  water  (Takara). 
The amplification conditions were as follows: 94°C for 
1 min; 37 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 30 s, and 
72°C for 90 s; and 72°C for 3.5 min for a final extension 
step. Negative controls (without DNA template) and a 
positive control (Staph. aureus ATCC 6538 template) 
were included in all PCR assays.

Phenotypic Detection of Antimicrobial Resistance

Antimicrobial  susceptibility  patterns  for  recovered 
Staph. aureus isolates were determined by the agar disc 
diffusion method according to the guidelines of the Clin-
ical Laboratory Standard Institute (Bauer et al., 1966; 
CLSI, 2012). Penicillin G (10U), amoxicillin-clavulanic 
acid (20/10 μg), tobramycin (10 μg), tetracycline (30 
μg), gentamicin (10 μg), azithromycin (15 μg), oxacillin 
(1  μg),  streptomycin  (10  μg),  cefoxitin  (30  μg),  oxy-
tetracycline (30 μg), clindamycin (2 μg), erythromycin 
(15 μg), ampicillin (10 μg), chloramphenicol (30 μg), 
quinupristin-dalfopristin (15 μg), ciprofloxacin (5 μg), 
kanamycin (30 μg), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 
(1.25/23.75 μg) were used as antimicrobial agents (Ox-
oid,  Basingstoke,  UK).  Staphylococcus  aureus  ATCC 
6538  and  Escherichia  coli  ATCC  25922  were  used  as 
quality  controls  in  each  run.  The  experiment  was  re-
peated twice.

Antimicrobial Resistance Genes

Antimicrobial  resistance  genes  to  penicillin  (blaZ 
and mecA), cefoxitin (cfxA and mecA), aminoglycoside 

(aac6’-aph2”,  ant(6)-Ia,  aph3’-IIIa),  chloramphenicol 
(fexA  and  catA),  tetracycline  [tet(K),  tet(L),  tet(M) 
and  tet(O)],  erythromycin  [erm(A),  erm(B),  erm(C), 
msr(A), and msr(B)], streptomycin [ant(6)-Ia], quinu-
pristin-dalfopristin  [vga(A)  and  vga(B)],  and  oxacillin 
(mecA)  resistance  genes,  as  well  as  the  multidrug-
resistance gene (cfr) were tested by PCR in all Staph. 
aureus strains (Supplemental Table S1https:// doi .org/ 
10 .3168/ jds .2017 -13370).

Detection of Virulence Determinants

The genes encoding staphylococcal enterotoxins (sea, 
seb,  sec,  sed,  see,  seg,  seh,  sei,  sek,  sel,  ser,  ses,  sej, 
and  set),  enterotoxin-like  (selm,  selo,  selp,  and  selu), 
toxic-shock  syndrome  toxin  (tst-1),  exfoliative  toxin 
genes  (eta  and  etb),  and  Panton-Valentine  leukocidin 
(pvl) were detected by PCR. Amplified products were 
analyzed  using  1.5%  agarose  gel  electrophoresis  and 
visualized  by  staining  with  SYBR  Safe  DNA  Stain 
gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The information of all 
primers used for PCR is shown in Supplemental Table 
S1 (https:// doi .org/ 10 .3168/ jds .2017 -13370).

RESULTS

Prevalence of Staph. aureus

In the present study, 54 strains of Staph. aureus were 
isolated from raw milk, including 24 strains (32%) in 75 
Hohhot samples, 8 strains (26.7%) in 30 Jinan samples, 
11 strains (27.5%) in 40 Harbin samples, and 11 strains 
(22.0%) in 50 Beijing samples.

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing

The 54 isolates of Staph. aureus were tested for sus-
ceptibility to 18 antimicrobial agents by using the disc 
diffusion  method.  Antimicrobial  resistance  was  most 
frequently observed to penicillin G (85.2%), followed by 
resistance to ampicillin (79.6%), erythromycin (46.3%), 
cefoxitin  (42.6%),  clindamycin  (35.2%),  azithromy-
cin  (35.2%),  ciprofloxacin  (29.6%),  oxacillin  (29.6%), 
sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim  (20.4%),  kanamycin 
(14.8%), oxytetracycline (14.8%), tetracycline (13.0%), 
gentamicin  (11.1%),  streptomycin  (9.26%),  chloram-
phenicol  (7.41%),  tobramycin  (5.56%),  quinupristin-
dalfopristin  (3.7%),  and  amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid 
(0%) (Table 1). Among the 54 Staph. aureus isolates, 
resistance to β-lactams (47.4%) was the most frequently 
observed, followed by resistance to macrolides (40.8%) 
and lincomycin (35.2%). Conversely, a low percentage 
of  antimicrobial  resistance  was  observed  for  chloram-
phenicol (7.41%) and streptogramin (3.7%).

Moreover, 72.2% of isolates showed resistance to 2 or 
more antibiotics. Two of the isolates were resistant to 
12 of the 18 antibiotics tested, and 11 strains (20.4%) 
were  susceptible  to  all  tested  antimicrobial  agents. 
Sixteen isolates (29.6%) were identified as methicillin-
resistant strains by antimicrobial susceptibility (oxacil-
lin  resistance).  All  methicillin-resistant  Staph.  aureus 
(MRSA)  showed  resistance  (100%)  to  cefoxitin  and 
penicillin.

genes  were  not  detected  in  chloramphenicol-resistant 
strains. The ant(6)-Ia gene was not detected in strep-
tomycin-resistant strains; and vga(A) and vga(B) genes 
were not detected in quinupristin-dalfopristin-resistant 
strains. Furthermore, the correlations between resistant 
phenotypes and genotypes for tetracycline, gentamicin, 
kanamycin, and oxacillin were 100%.

Distribution of Virulence Genes

Screening of Antimicrobial Resistance Genes

The  results  of  antimicrobial  resistance  genes  detec-
tion  are  presented  in  Table  2.  All  Staph.  aureus  iso-
lates  resistant  to  gentamicin,  kanamycin,  and  oxacil-
lin  carried  aac6’-aph2”,  ant(4’)-Ia,  and  mecA  genes, 
respectively. The blaZ, cfxA, and ant(4’)-Ia genes were 
detected in 63, 56.5, and 66.7% of penicillin-resistant, 
cefoxitin-resistant,  and  tobramycin-resistant  isolates, 
respectively. The tet(K), tet(M), and tet(L) genes were 
found  alone  or  together  with  others  in  the  following 
percentages  of  the  isolates:  tet(K)  (14.3%),  tet(M) 
(42.9%),  tet(K)+tet(L)  (28.6%),  and  tet(M)+tet(L) 
(14.3%).  The  tet(L)  gene  was  detected  together  with 
tet(K) and tet(M) in the same isolates. No tetracycline-
resistant  isolates  harbored  the  tet(O)  gene.  Addition-
ally, 2 tet(M)-positive strains carried a Tn916-Tn1545 
transposon gene. The erythromycin-resistant isolates (n 
= 25) harbored erm(B) (3 isolates, 12%), erm(C) (4 iso-
lates, 16%), msr(A) (1 isolate, 4%), erm(B) and erm(C) 
(3 isolates, 12%), erm(C) and erm(A) (1 isolate, 4%), 
erm(C) and msr(A) (2 isolates, 8%), and erm(C) and 
msr(B) genes (1 isolate, 4%). However, fexA and catA 

As  shown  in  Table  3,  the  most  predominant  toxin 
genes were sec (12/54, 22.2%), followed by sea (8/54, 
14.8%), pvl (8/54, 14.8%), tst (8/54, 14.8%), sej (7/54, 
13.0%), selp (6/54, 11.1%), ses (5/54, 9.3%), seg (5/54, 
9.3%),  sei  (4/54,  7.4%),  sed  (4/54,  7.4%),  seb  (3/54, 
5.6%),  ser  (1/54,  1.9%),  eta  (1/54,  1.9%),  see  (1/54, 
1.9%),  and  set  (1/54,  1.9%).  The  seh,  sek,  sel,  selm, 
selo, selu, and etb genes were not detected in the Staph. 
aureus isolates.

As  shown  in  Table  4,  59.2%  of  the  strains  (32/54) 
harbored  one  or  more  virulence  genes,  and  40.7%  of 
the  strains  (22/54)  did  not  detect  any  of  the  above 
virulence  genes.  Among  the  32  Staph.  aureus  strains, 
one  strain  harbored  6  virulence  genes  together:  seg, 
sec, tst, sea, selp, and pvl . Three isolates harbored 4 
virulence genes with 2 different gene patterns, and the 
combination of seg, sec, tst, and sea was the dominant 
gene pattern. Eight isolates harbored 3 virulence genes 
with 8 different gene patterns. Nine isolates harbored 
2  virulence  genes  with  7  different  gene  patterns,  and 
the combinations of sei and pvl or sei and sej was the 
dominant  gene  pattern.  Eleven  isolates  possessed  one 
virulence gene with 7 different gene patterns.

DISCUSSION

In  the  present  study,  25.8%  (54/195)  of  raw  milk 
samples  were  positive  for  Staph.  aureus  in  raw  milk. 
These  results  are  significantly  lower  than  in  previous 
reports,  which  indicated  that  the  occurrence  rate  of 
Staph.  aureus  in  raw  milk  was  83%  in  Turkey  (Bar-
tolomeoli  et  al.,  2009),  66.7%  in  Malaysia  (Andre  et 
al., 2008), 56% in Brazil (Gundogan and Avci, 2014), 
and 41.0% in Italy (Traversa et al., 2015). In contrast, 
a much lower occurrence rate (12.4%) of Staph. aureus 

was  found  in  raw  milk  in  Iran  (Jamali  et  al.,  2015). 
Overall, the results of our current study indicate that 
Staph.  aureus  is  common  in  raw  milk  collected  from 
dairy herds throughout northern China. Major sources 
of  Staph.  aureus  in  raw  milk  might  include  infected 
cows and inappropriate hygiene conditions (Jamali, et 
al., 2015). Further research is ongoing and will explore 
methods of controlling Staph. aureus occurrence in raw 
milk.

In our analysis, 72.2% of isolates showed resistance 
to  2  or  more  antibiotics,  and  61.1%  of  Staph.  aureus

isolates  showed  multidrug  resistance  (MDR),  which 
was much higher than reported in other studies. Other 
researchers  have  reported  lower  rates  of  MDR  Staph. 
aureus  (Haran  et  al.,  2012;  Jamali  et  al.,  2015).  The 
high  prevalence  of  drug-resistant  Staph.  aureus  from 
raw milk—the raw material for dairy products—should 
be considered a potential risk to human health in north-
ern China. Moreover, we investigated antibiotic use for 
mastitis in northern China in our previous survey, and 
found  that  6  antibiotics  (penicillin,  ampicillin,  cipro-
floxacin,  sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim,  gentamicin, 
and streptomycin) are commonly used in dairy mastitis 
therapy (data not shown). In the current study, most 
of the Staph. aureus strains showed a high percentage 
of  antimicrobial  resistance  to  penicillin,  ampicillin, 
ciprofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. The 
results  indicated  a  correlation  between  antibiotic  use 
and antimicrobial resistance. Similar findings were re-
ported by Saini et al. (2012), who found that herd-level 
use of certain antimicrobials administered for mastitis 
treatment was positively associated with antimicrobial 
resistance  in  isolates  from  a  clinical  mastitis  sample. 
Data on antibiotic susceptibility of Staph. aureus can 
be helpful in choosing the most suitable antibiotic for 
mastitis treatment (Wang et al., 2016). Based on the 
high  percentage  of  resistance  to  penicillin  and  ampi-
cillin,  these  antibiotics  should  be  used  with  caution 
for mastitis caused by Staph. aureus in dairy herds in 
northern China.

Methicillin-resistant  Staph.  aureus  is  an  emerging 
pathogen in livestock animals that is readily transfer-
able to humans that are in contact with livestock. In 
this study, 16 isolates (29.6%) were identified as MRSA 
by antimicrobial susceptibility, and all MRSA isolates 
showed resistance to cefoxitin and penicillin, which is 
similar  to  findings  of  several  prior  studies  (Bhargava 
and Zhang, 2012; Chajecka-Wierzchowska et al., 2015). 
The  MRSA  resistance  was  caused  by  the  expression 
of a modified penicillin-binding protein (PBP), named 
PBP2A, with reduced affinity for β-lactam antimicrobi-
al agents. For MRSA, β-lactams cannot bind to native 
PBP2A,  so  synthesis  of  peptidoglycan  and  bacterial 
growth occur normally (Diaz et al., 2016).

Tetracylines are broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents 
frequently used in the treatment of infections in cattle 
(Chajecka-Wierzchowska  et  al.,  2016).  In  our  study, 
13.9%  of  Staph.  aureus  isolates  showed  resistance  to 
tetracylines. The high prevalence of resistance to tet-
racycline  has  been  reported  previously  among  Staph. 
aureus  isolates  from  different  sources  (Andre  et  al., 
2008; Gundogan and Avci, 2014; Jamali et al., 2015). 
Moreover,  tetracycline  resistance  can  be  conferred  by 
genes encoding efflux proteins TetK and TetL or ribo-
somal protection proteins TetM, TetO, and TetS (Huys 
et al., 2004). In our study, all the tetracycline-resistant 
isolates  harbored  at  least  one  tetracycline  resistance 
determinant, of which tet(M) was most frequent. These 
results are in agreement with the findings of Bhargava

and Zhang (2012), who detected tet(M) in 64.3% of in-
vestigated strains. In the current study, tet(M)-positive 
isolates carried the transposon and tet(M) was the most 
prevalent  tet  gene  detected  among  the  tetracycline-
resistant  Staph.  aureus  isolates.  Several  studies  have 
shown that the spread of resistance to antimicrobial is 
largely due to the acquisition of plasmids or transpo-
sons (Lopatkin et al., 2016; Pehrsson et al., 2016).

In this study, the correlation between resistant phe-
notypes  and  genotypes  for  tetracycline,  gentamicin, 
kanamycin, and oxacillin was 100%. Genotypic predic-
tion  of  resistance  relies  on  highly  curated  databases 
of known resistance determinants and cannot identify 
new mechanisms. Therefore, testing phenotypic suscep-
tibility is still necessary to fully account for resistance 
and  predict  new  mechanisms  of  resistance  (Zhao  et 
al.,  2015).  Knowing  which  antimicrobial  resistance 
genes  are  present  in  bacterial  populations  is  critical 
to  developing  new  strategies  to  combat  antimicrobial 
resistance, including improving antimicrobial resistance 
and implementing surveillance programs for foodborne 
diseases.

Another  important  factor  in  the  pathogenesis  of 
Staph.  aureus  infections  is  virulence.  Once  enterotox-
ins are produced, they generally retain their biological 
activity  even  after  heat  treatment  (Cavicchioli  et  al., 
2015). In the present study, 19 staphylococcal entero-
toxin  genes  were  tested,  and  60.3%  of  Staph.  aureus 
isolates harbored one or more of these virulence genes. 
The  enterotoxin  gene  distribution  in  Staph.  aureus 
isolates  from  raw  milk  could  provide  epidemiological 
information for public health and food safety. The sec, 
sea, pvl, and tst genes were frequently detected in iso-
lates from raw milk in our study. The most frequently 
reported virulence gene in Staph. aureus from goat milk 
is  the  sec  gene  (Cavicchioli  et  al.,  2015);  tst  and  sec 
are usually detected together from goat and ovine milk 
(Xing et al., 2016); and pvl is usually detected in Staph. 
aureus from raw milk. The pvl gene plays an important 
role in pathogenesis with a strong ability to stimulate 
cytolysis  of  neutrophils,  apoptosis,  and  production  of 
pro-inflammatory molecules (Liu, 2009). This suggests 
that attention should be paid not only to classical en-
terotoxins in raw milk and other dairy products, but 
also to other virulence factors detected among patho-
genic staphylococci.

CONCLUSIONS

This  study  assessed  the  antimicrobial  resistance 
of  Staph.  aureus  strains  isolated  from  raw  milk  in 
northern China. Our data indicate that Staph. aureus 
is  prevalent  in  raw  milk  from  herds  in  the  northern 
region. The detected Staph. aureus strains exhibited a 

high percentage of antimicrobial resistant and carried 
multiple  virulence  genes.  Therefore,  it  is  important 
to  monitor  the  use  of  antimicrobial  agents  and  the 
potential  transfer  of  antimicrobial  resistance  genes  in 
northern China. Penicillin G and ampicillin for mastitis 
caused by Staph. aureus should be used with caution in 
dairy herds in northern China. Further studies should 
be carried out to evaluate the possibility of acquiring, 
transferring, and transmitting antimicrobial resistance 
genes among Staph. aureus.
