Impacts
• This study has estimated the prevalence of Salmonella spp. and their antimi-
crobial susceptibilities on poultry and swine farms, sampled in Central Viet-
nam.

• Our results showed that Salmonella prevalence was signiﬁcantly high both
in poultry and swine farms sampled; MDR Salmonella incidence was high,
corresponding to 59.6% of Salmonella totally isolated.

• This updated report on the occurrence of Salmonella from Central Vietnam,
underlines a need for integrating these data on Salmonella epidemiology in
Central Vietnam with in-depth molecular analysis on the prevalence of
resistance determinants as well as with data on Salmonella occurrence in
corresponding meat products.

Summary

This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of Salmonella spp. and their
antimicrobial susceptibilities on poultry and swine farms, sampled in 2 regions in
Central Vietnam. A total of 67 poultry farms and 46 swine farms were sampled in
a period of 5 months (from September 2012 to January 2013). Salmonella spp.
was prevalent in 46.3% and 71.7% of poultry and swine farms, respectively. Alto-
gether, 99 non-typhoidal Salmonella were isolated and the most common sero-
vars were Salmonella Weltevreden (19%), followed by Salmonella Typhimurium
(12%) and Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- (11%). Overall, 71 of 99 (72%) Salmonella iso-
lates were resistant to at least one of the 14 antimicrobial agents tested. Both in
poultry and swine farms, high levels of resistance were observed for ampicillin,
chloramphenicol, ciproﬂoxacin, sulphamethoxazole and tetracycline. The pres-
ence of Salmonella isolates from poultry and swine farms which were resistant to
different classes of antimicrobials suggests that alternative control measures to
antimicrobials should be implemented. Moreover, an effective policy should be
promoted to encourage a prudent use of these agents in animal farming in
Vietnam.

Introduction

Salmonella spp. cause one of the most important enteric
diseases worldwide. The global human health impact of
non-typhoidal Salmonella bacteria is estimated at 93.8 mil-
lion illnesses annually. Of these illnesses, an estimated 80.3

million are foodborne and associated with 155 000 deaths
(Majowicz et al., 2010).

Food-producing animals such as poultry, pigs and cattle
play a crucial role as primary reservoirs of Salmonella and
vehicles for salmonellosis worldwide. This is especially so in
developing countries which are often characterized by poor

food safety measures (Lai et al., 2014). Because of the abil-
ity of Salmonella to contaminate meat during slaughter and
to survive in fresh meats and meat products that are not
thoroughly heated, nowadays, animal products still consti-
tute a main vehicle of transmission in developing countries
(Adeyanju and Ishola, 2014; Tadesse and Gebremedhin,
2015). In Central Vietnam, few data regarding the preva-
lence and distribution of Salmonella spp. in food-produ-
cing animals are available (Ta et al., 2014). However, a
number of studies investigated the presence of Salmonella
in food samples in different areas of Vietnam, such as the
Mekong Delta or North of Vietnam (Thai et al., 2012; Tu
et al., 2015).

Within Vietnam, access to antimicrobials is relatively dif-
ﬁcult to control despite regulations that are supposed to
limit access (Report antibiotics use, 2009). In addition,
there appears to be a general lack of knowledge about the
purpose and proper usage of antibiotics by farmers (Pham
et al., 2015). These factors, coupled with the high burden
of human infectious disease, have made this country, as
other developing countries, a potential hot spot for the
emergence of drug resistance (Nguyen et al., 2013).

Animal production is an increasingly important industry
in Vietnam and one in which antibiotics are extensively
used for several purposes including therapeutics, prophy-
laxis and growth promotion (GARP, 2009). Of all pharma-
ceutical products used in the animal sector, 70% are
antibiotics (GARP - Global Antibiotic Resistance Partner-
ship, 2009). Since Vietnam joined the World Trade Organi-
zation (WTO), regulation of antibiotic use in animals has
increased and certain antibiotics, such as chloramphenicol
and ﬂuoroquinolones, have been banned (MARD, 2010).
Surveillance for antibiotic residues in meat as well as in ﬁsh
reveals frequent misuse of antibiotics in Vietnam (Pham
et al., 2013, 2015). Thus, the use of antibiotics in livestock
might contribute to the increase of antimicrobial-resistant
bacteria in humans via the food chain.

In Asian countries, these problems remain poorly inves-
tigated, especially in the food and animal ﬁelds (Tran et al.,
2004, 2006; Tabo et al., 2013; Tu et al., 2015). Hence, the
aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of
Salmonella spp. in poultry and pig farms located in the
Binh Dinh and Khanh Hoa provinces of Central Vietnam.
In addition,
resistance patterns of
Salmonella isolates were investigated.

The samplings were distributed in poultry and swine
farms according to their size and production categories,
and on each farm, the number of samples collected was
proportional to the farm size, with a maximum of seven
samples per farm (ﬁve faeces and two dusts). Poultry sam-
ples were collected from broiler, laying hen and breeder
farms, whereas swine samples were collected from fattening
(17 from rural, nine from industrial), farrow-to-weaner (11
from rural, ﬁve from industrial) and sow (three from rural,
one from industrial) (Table 1).

Two types of farms, common in the area under study,
were sampled: industrial farms, which involve large-scale or
commercial production of high-performance types of live-
stock, and rural ones which are based on the rearing of a
small number of animals of local breeds in rural villages.

All samples were transported in a cooler box to the labo-
ratory at the Central Vietnam Veterinary Institute (CVVI,
Nha Trang, Vietnam), within 24 h of sampling and stored
at 4°C.

Salmonella isolation

Salmonella isolation was carried out according to ISO
6579:2002 (Annex D) (Anon., 2007) within 24 h after arri-
val at the laboratory. In particular, from each sample up to
ﬁve presumptive Salmonella colonies were chosen for bio-
chemical conﬁrmation.

Salmonella prevalence on Vietnamese farms

Salmonella serotyping and phage typing
All Salmonella were serotyped according to the White–
Kauffmann–Le Minor
scheme by slide agglutination
method (Grimont and Weill, 2007) at the National and
OIE Reference Laboratory for Salmonella (NRL-IZSVe,
Legnaro, Italy).

â

Salmonella isolates for which it was not possible to iden-
tify a deﬁnitive serovar by traditional agglutination were
examined by a molecular serotyping assay based on a bead
Salmonella Serotyping Assay,
suspension array (xMAP
SSA, Luminex Corp., Austin, TX, USA) to infer their anti-
genic formula. SSA is a molecular serotyping assay address-
ing a set of target genes involved in the expression of the
most common Salmonella serotype-speciﬁc antigens. Mul-
tiplex PCR is used to amplify Salmonella antigen gene tar-
get
in the
amplicons. The ampliﬁed target sequences are then cap-
tured by direct hybridization onto bead sets coupled with
complementary oligonucleotide capture probes and ﬁnally
labelled with a ﬂuorescent reporter for detection on the
Bio-Plex analyzer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) (Fitzgerald
et al., 2007; Dunbar et al., 2015).

sequences and incorporate a biotin label

All S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium (including S. 4,
[5],12:i:-) isolates were phage-typed using the protocol pre-
viously reported (Anderson et al., 1977; Rabsch, 2007) and
according to the recommendations of Public Health Eng-
land (Colindale, London, United Kingdom). The deﬁnitive
phage typing of S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium (includ-
ing S. 4,[5],12:i:-) was performed using the standard set of
17 and 38 typing phages, respectively, received from Public
Health England.

The isolates showing a phage pattern that did not con-
form to any recognized phage type were designated as ‘react
but did not conform’, and isolates that did not react with
any of the typing phages were designated as ‘non-typeable’.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Antimicrobial
susceptibility of Salmonella isolates was
tested against 14 antimicrobials by determining the mini-
mum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using the Clinical
and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdi-
lution method (CLSI, 2009) in combination with the semi-
automatic Sensititre system (TREK Diagnostic Systems,
Cleveland, OH, USA). The antimicrobials tested were as
follows: ampicillin (AMP), ceftazidime (CAZ), cefotaxime
(FOT), chloramphenicol (CHL), ciproﬂoxacin (CIP), col-
istin (COL), ﬂorfenicol (FFN), gentamicin (GEN), kana-
mycin (KAN), nalidixic acid (NAL), streptomycin (STR),
sulfamethoxazole (SMX), tetracycline (TET) and trimetho-
prim (TMP). The EUCAST epidemiological cut-offs were
used (EUCAST, 2015) except for SMX and KAN where the

CLSI break points were considered (CLSI - Clinical and
Laboratory Standards
Institute, 2009). Escherichia coli
ATCC 25922 was used as a control strain. Antimicrobial
resistance was deﬁned as resistance to one or more classes
of antimicrobials (there were 8 classes among the 14
antimicrobials; WHO, 2011), whereas multidrug resistance
(MDR) was deﬁned as a resistance to four or more classes
of antimicrobials.

Statistical analysis

Exact conﬁdence intervals (CI) were calculated for the esti-
mated prevalences. The Z-test was performed to verify the
signiﬁcant differences between prevalences. The P-value
<0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.SAS 9.3 software (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used to analyse data.

Results

Sampling
A total of 67 poultry farms were sampled in the two Viet-
namese provinces studied, grouped according to animal
species and production categories as reported in Table 1.
Among the poultry farms studied, broiler farms accounted
for 61.2% of those sampled (41/67), laying hen farms for
30% (20/67) and the breeders for 9% (6/67). Overall, 430
(310 faeces and 120 dust) samples were collected from
poultry farms.

With regard to pigs, 46 swine farms were sampled as
described in Table 1. The great majority of swine samples
were collected from fattening farms (56.5%, 26/46), fol-
lowed by swine farms with both farrow-to-weaner (34.8%,
16/46) and sow farms being the least represented (8.7%,
4/46). In total, the 241 swine farm samples were composed
of 167 faecal and 74 dust samples, respectively.

Salmonella isolation and serovar distribution

According to the total samples collected both in poultry
and swine farms, the Salmonella prevalence observed in fae-
cal samples was signiﬁcantly higher than the prevalence
observed in dust samples (P < 0.001) (Table 2). Salmonella
spp. was isolated from 31 of the 67 [46.3%, CI (33.99;
58.88)] poultry farms sampled in both Vietnamese pro-
vinces. Among these farms, 18 of 44 [40.9%, CI (26.33;
56.75)] rural farms and 13 of 23 [56.5%, CI (34.49; 79.80)]
industrial farms were positive for Salmonella. Among the
16 serovars identiﬁed from poultry farms, the ﬁve most fre-
quent were as follows: S. Weltevreden (25%), S. Limete
(10.4%), S. Typhimurium (14.6%), S. Javiana (8.3%) and
S. Enteritidis (8.3%) (Table 3).

Concerning swine farms, the Salmonella prevalence was
71.7% (CI [56.54; 80.01]) (33 of 46 farms sampled).

RDNC (react but does not conform), isolated from poultry
farms.

For S. Typhimurium isolated from poultry, two isolates
were NT,
three were phage-typed as DT120 and the
remaining two as DT193. Similarly, four of ﬁve S. Typhi-
murium isolated from swine were phage type DT120, whilst
the remaining isolate was NT (Table 4).

With regard to S. 4,[5],12:i:- isolated from poultry farms,
two were phage type DT120 and one isolate was DT193.
Concerning swine farms, the predominant phage type was
DT193 displayed by ﬁve isolates, one was DT120 and two
were NT (Table 4).

*Salmonella isolate with an incomplete and unrecognized antigenic for-
mula phenotypically. This isolate was indistinguishable from S. India and
S. Panama when examined by the molecular SAA approach used.

Salmonella spp. were isolated from 22 of 31 rural farms
[71%, CI (51.96; 85.78)] and 11 of 15 industrial farms
[73.3%, CI (44.90; 92.21)]. Fourteen Salmonella serovars
were isolated from the swine farms. The ﬁve most prevalent
serovars were as follows: S. 4,[5],12:i:-, S. Weltevreden, S.
Panama, S. Derby and S. Typhimurium (15.7%, 13.7%,
13.7%, 11.8% and 9.8%, respectively).

The molecular SSA approach could not determine the
serovar for all Salmonella isolates tested. For one swine iso-
late, the O antigen assay detected the somatic group D, but
it was unable to discriminate between group D1 and D2.
The H antigen assay detected the ﬂagellar antigens l,v and
1,5, and thus, the molecular antigenic formula of this iso-
late was indistinguishable from S. India and S. Panama
(Table 3).

Determination of antimicrobial resistance proﬁles

The phenotypic antimicrobial resistance proﬁles of the Sal-
monella serovars isolated from poultry and swine farms in
this study are shown in Table 5.

With regard to poultry, 15 of 48 Salmonella isolates were
fully susceptible to the antimicrobials tested. The antimi-
crobial to which the greatest percentage of isolates were
resistant was sulfamethoxazole (60.4%), followed by tetra-
cycline (58.3%), ciproﬂoxacin (54.2%), ampicillin (45.8%),
chloramphenicol
and trimethoprim (37.5%)
(Fig. 1). Generally, fewer poultry isolates were resistant to
streptomycin (35.4%), ﬂorfenicol (31.3%), nalidixic acid
(25%), gentamicin (18.8), kanamycin (10.4%) and colistin
(6.3%) (Fig. 1). All poultry Salmonella isolates were suscep-
tible to cefotaxime and ceftazidime.

Among the 51 swine isolates, 13 (25.5%) were fully sus-
ceptible to the antimicrobials tested. The antimicrobial to
which the greatest percentage of swine isolates were resis-
tant was tetracycline (70.6%), followed by sulfamethoxa-
zole (64.7%), ciproﬂoxacin (62.7%), chloramphenicol
(60.8%), ﬂorfenicol (60.8%), ampicillin (58.8%), strepto-
mycin (43.1%),
trimethoprim (41.2%) and gentamicin
(39.2%). Overall, fewer swine isolates were resistant to nali-
dixic acid and kanamycin [(25.5% and 17.6%, respec-
tively); Fig. 1]. As observed for poultry isolates, all
Salmonella isolated from swine were fully susceptible to
cefotaxime and ceftazidime. No resistance to colistin was
observed.

As far as MDR was concerned, no differences were
observed between isolates from rural or industrial farms,

both for poultry or swine species. However, a signiﬁcantly
higher proportion of industrial swine farms (78.6%) har-
boured Salmonella isolates which exhibited MDR than did
industrial poultry farms (44%) (P < 0.05).

In addition, nine of 19 S. Weltevreden isolated in this
study were resistant to at least one of the antimicrobials
tested. Among these, only one isolate possessed a MDR
proﬁle.

Discussion

This study provided data on Salmonella prevalence and
antibiotic resistance in livestock farms located in the Cen-
tral area of Vietnam. Salmonella spp. were isolated from
46.3% and 72% of poultry and swine farms, respectively.

These prevalences are comparable with those reported in
previous studies conducted in Vietnam (Ellerbroek et al.,
2010; Ta et al., 2014).

Lack of information about the Salmonella serovars circu-
lating in animal populations hampers the implementation
of effective control measures (Dorneles et al., 2010).

The patterns of the most common Salmonella serovars
identiﬁed in the present study are quite consistent with pre-
vious reports on this source in Vietnam (Tran et al., 2004;
Ogasawara et al., 2008). In particular, the prevalence of S.
Weltevreden (19.1%) is consistent with other reports con-
ducted in South-East Asian countries (Aarestrup et al.,
2003; Tran et al., 2004). However, the percentage of antimi-
crobial resistant S. Weltevreden observed in this study
(47%) was higher than that of reported in previous studies
(less than 10%) (Aarestrup et al., 2003; Huong et al., 2014).
Overall, our data showed a high prevalence of S. Typhi-
murium and S. 4,[5],12:i:- both in poultry and swine farms,
consistent with trends described in Western countries, as
well as in other developing countries in South-East Asia
(Barco et al., 2011; Hendriksen et al., 2011; EFSA and
ECDC, 2015).

The high percentages of Salmonella isolates with antimi-
crobial resistance to sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, ampi-
cillin or chloramphenicol overall observed in our study are
also comparable to those described in previous Vietnamese
reports (Vo et al., 2010; Thai et al., 2012; Huong et al.,
2014) and in other Asian countries (Yang et al., 2010).

Conversely, with regard to ciproﬂoxacin, we stress that a
higher percentage of resistant Salmonella was detected in
our study, both from poultry (54.2%) and swine samples
(62.7%), than in other Vietnamese studies (Van et al.,
2007; Vo et al., 2010).

Consistent with this evidence, a worldwide reduced sus-
is occurring (Veldman

ceptibility to ﬂuoroquinolones
et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2014).

Our ﬁndings suggest that integrating these data on Sal-
monella epidemiology and dissemination in Central Viet-
nam will help guide management practices and regulations
concerning restrictions on the use of antibiotics critical to
human health within poultry and swine farms.
