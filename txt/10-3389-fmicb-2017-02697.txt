The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of Salmonella spp.,
Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium in retail beef from different retail
markets of Selangor area, as well as,
to assess their pathogenic potential and
antimicrobial resistance. A total of 240 retail beef meat samples (chuck = 60; rib = 60;
round = 60; sirloin = 60) were randomly collected. The multiplex polymerase chain
reaction (mPCR) in combination with the most probable number (MPN) method was
employed to detect Salmonella spp., S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium in the meat
samples. The prevalence of Salmonella spp., S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium in
240 beef meat samples were 7.50, 1.25, and 0.83%, respectively. The microbial
loads of total Salmonella was found in the range of <3 to 15 MPN/g. Eight different
serovars of Salmonella were identiﬁed among the 23 isolates, and S. Agona was the
predominant serovar (26.09%). Interestingly, all the Salmonella isolates were resistant to
penicillin, erythromycin and vancomycin, but the sensitivity was observed for tetracycline,
gentamicin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. All 23 isolates were resistant to at least
three antibiotics. Two S. Typhimurium isolates (8.70%) exhibited the highest multiple
antibiotic resistance (MAR) index value of 0.56 which shown resistance to nine antibiotics.
PCR analysis of virulence genes showed that all Salmonella isolates (100%) were
positive for the invA gene. Meanwhile, pefA was only identiﬁed in S. Enteritidis and
S. Typhimurium. The ﬁndings in this study indicate that retail beef products tested were
widely contaminated with multi-drug resistant (MDR) Salmonella and various virulence
genes are present among the isolated Salmonella serovars.

Salmonella Serovars in Retail Beef

INTRODUCTION

The intestinal epithelium infection known as salmonellosis is
caused by the genus Salmonella. The major pathogenic serovars
of Salmonella enterica that
infect humans from a variety
of diﬀerent food products include Salmonella Enteritidis and
Salmonella Typhimurium (Kramarenko et al., 2014; Yang et al.,
2016; Ed-dra et al., 2017). In the USA over 40,000 salmonellosis
cases are reported each year and foods of animal origin are
considered to be the most likely source of Salmonella (Finstad
et al., 2012). It is well known that human Salmonella infections
are associated with many diﬀerent kinds of food, including beef
meat and beef meat products (Brichta-Harhay et al., 2008; Sallam
et al., 2014). Hence, the presence of Salmonella in beef at the
slaughter level and at the market is a signiﬁcant food safety risk.
Sensitive and speciﬁc methods with shorter turnaround
time for the detection and identiﬁcation of Salmonella are
needed to reduce testing-related laboratory costs. Therefore,
multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) uses few pairs of
primers simultaneously detecting diﬀerent pathogens in the same
samples has the potential as a reliable and eﬀective method
(Pui et al., 2011). Previously, a detection method consist of
mPCR and the most probable number (MPN) method has
successfully been performed to detect and identify S. Enteritidis
and S. Typhimurium in chicken meat (Thung et al., 2016).
Indeed, the mPCR-MPN method has widely been used to detect
and enumerate food-borne pathogens such as Campylobacter
spp. (Chai et al., 2007), Listeria monocytogenes (Kuan et al., 2013)
and Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Tan et al., 2017). Recently, gold
nanoparticle-aptamer-based localized surface plasmon resonance
(LSPR) sensing chip was developed to enable the ultra-sensitive
and selective detection of S. Typhimurium in pork meat (Oh
et al., 2017).

In general, bacterial virulence factors have a crucial role
for systemic infections. The pathogenicity of Salmonella strains
has been related to numerous virulence genes present in the
chromosomal Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPIs) (Nayak
et al., 2004). Genes such as invA and hilA, found in SPI, allow
Salmonella to invade epithelial cells (Cardona-Castro et al.,
2002; Nayak et al., 2004). Besides, Salmonella outer proteins
(sops) (SPI eﬀector protein) encoded by sop gene have relevance
to Salmonella virulence (Huehn et al., 2010). Meanwhile,
the plasmid encoded ﬁmbriae (pefA) gene contributes to the
adhesion of Salmonella to epithelial cells (Murugkar et al.,
2003). Other chromosomal gene like stn, codes for enterotoxin
production has been shown to be a causative agent of diarrhea
(Huehn et al., 2010). In addition, virulence plasmids carrying
virulence genes such as the spv operon (Salmonella plasmid
virulence) contribute to the colonization of deeper tissues among
other functions (Swamy et al., 1996).

To date, the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance
among zoonotic Salmonella has become a public health threat
(Sallam et al., 2014). Importantly, Salmonella strains having
“clinically important resistance” to some agents like extended-
spectrum cephalosporins and ﬂuoroquinolones, have been
isolated from livestock (Li et al., 2013). In most developing
countries, misuse and overuse of antibiotics has contributed

to the increasing trend of multi-resistance in Salmonella (Ed-
dra et al., 2017). In Selangor (center of Peninsular Malaysia),
although some reports were found based on the prevalence of
Salmonella in diﬀerent types of foods, but limited information
on the surveillance study of Salmonella spp., S. Enteritidis and S.
Typhimurium in beef meat at retail level are available. Therefore,
the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence, virulence genes
and antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella serovars isolated from
retail beef meat in Selangor area.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Collection of Meat Sample
Four diﬀerent parts of beef meat samples (chuck = 60; rib = 60;
round = 60; sirloin = 60) with a total number of 240 were
collected from retail markets (wet markets and hypermarkets)
in Selangor area over 9 months period from September 2014 to
May 2015 (approximately 25 to 27 samples per month). The retail
meat samples were kept in sterile stomacher bags and transferred
to the laboratory for further analysis.

Enrichment and Most Probable Number
(MPN) Method
Ten gram of meat sample was homogenized for 50 s using a
stomacher after added in 90 mL of sterile buﬀered peptone water
(BPW) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Then, the suspension was
diluted up to 1,000-fold with 10-fold serial. Later, MPN method
(three-tube) was performed by transferring 1 mL of each dilution
into three replicate tubes with 10 mL of Rappaport-Vasiliadis
(RV) broth (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) each, and followed
by overnight incubation at 37◦C under aerobic conditions. The
turbid MPN tubes were selected for subsequent DNA extraction
using the boiled-cell method as described previously (Chai et al.,
2007).

Multiplex PCR Conditions
For mPCR detection, three primer pairs were used to identify

then treated with 0.3 µL (1.5 U) Taq DNA polymerase. PCR
ampliﬁcation was performed in triplicate with the following
conditions: initial denaturation at 94◦C for 2 min, 30 cycles
of denaturation at 94◦C for 45 s, annealing at 53◦C for 1 min,
extension at 72◦C for 1 min and ﬁnal extension at 72◦C for 7
min. The positive controls used were S. Typhimurium ATCC
14028 and S. Enteritidis ATCC 13076. Escherichia coli ATCC
25922 was used as a negative control.

Isolation and Identiﬁcation of Salmonella
The turbid MPN tubes were conﬁrmed to be Salmonella by
plating on selective CHROMagar Salmonella (CHROMagar
Microbiology, Paris, France) and Xylose Lysine Deoxycholate
(XLD) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) agar plates, and incubated
at 37◦C for 24 h. All the Salmonella isolates were then serotyped
by slide agglutination using polyvalent “O” and “H” antisera (BD,
Franklin Lakes, USA) at Veterinary Research Institute (VRI),
Ipoh, Malaysia in accordance with the Kauﬀmann-White scheme.

Antimicrobial Resistance Proﬁles
The antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated according to
Clinical and Laboratory Standarts Institude (2012) by using disc
diﬀusion method. Brieﬂy, isolates were cultured aerobically in 10
mL Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany)
at 37◦C for 24 h. Overnight cultures, grown on MH broth (OD
adjusted to 0.5 MacFarland unit), were swabbed evenly with
sterile non-toxic cotton swab on MH agar plates and left to dry
for 2 to 4 min. Then, antimicrobial sensitivity discs were placed
on the culture by using a disk dispenser and incubated at 37◦C
for 24 h. The tested antimicrobials were amoxicillin/clavulanic
acid (AMC, 30 µg), amoxycillin (AML, 30 µg), ceftazidime
(CAZ, 30 µg), cephazolin (KZ, 30 µg), ciproﬂoxacin (CIP, 5
µg), erythromycin (E, 15 µg), chloramphenicol (C, 30 µg),
ampicillin (AMP, 10 µg), penicillin (P, 10 µg), streptomycin
(S, 10 µg), tetracycline (TE, 30 µg), kanamycin (K, 30 µg),
gentamicin (CN, 10 µg), vancomycin (VA, 30 µg), nalidixic
acid (NA, 30 µg), and suphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SXT,
25 µg) (Oxoid, Hamphire, United Kingdom). The multiple
antibiotic resistance (MAR) index was calculated as “a/b,”
where “a” the number of antibiotics for a particular isolate
was resistant and “b” the total number of antibiotics tested
(Krumperman, 1983).

Detection of Virulence Genes
All Salmonella isolates collected in this study were screened for
the presence of virulence genes using PCR. The primers, the size
in base pairs of the respective ampliﬁcation products and the
references used for detection of six virulence genes are presented
in Table 1. The virulence genes under study were invA, pefA, hilA,
sopB, stn, and spvC. Positive (S. Typhimurium ATCC 14028 and
S. Enteritidis ATCC 13076) and negative control (E. coli ATCC
25922) were conducted in the detection procedure. To evaluate
the reproducibility of the experiments, PCR ampliﬁcation and
electrophoresis experiments were carried out in triplicate.

Statistical Analysis
All measurements were carried out in triplicate. Minitab (v. 14)
statistical package (Minitab Inc., State College, PA) was used
to determine if there was any signiﬁcant diﬀerence between
the prevalence of Salmonella in beef meat from wet market
and hypermarket. For all analysis, P < 0.05 was considered
signiﬁcant.

RESULTS

Prevalence of Salmonella in Beef
The target genes speciﬁc to Salmonella spp., S. Enteritidis and
S. Typhimurium produced amplicons at 429, 304, and 620 bp,
respectively. Figure 1 shows the result of gel electrophoresis
comparing various combinations of the PCR primer sets and
verifying the mPCR established for the current study consists of
three independent and speciﬁc PCR reactions. Of the 240 retail
beef meat samples tested, the contamination rates were 7.50%
(n = 18), 1.25% (n = 3), and 0.83% (n = 2) for Salmonella
spp., S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium, respectively (Table 2).
Beef part round was the major reservoir for Salmonella, with
prevalence rate of 16.67% (n = 60). The prevalence of Salmonella
spp. in wet markets (10.00%) were signiﬁcantly higher than
hypermarkets (5.00%) (P < 0.05). As shown in Table 3, the
highest microbial loads of Salmonella was found in Salmonella
spp. (15.0 MPN/g), followed by S. Enteritidis (3.6 MPN/g) and S.
Typhimurium (3.6 MPN/g).

Antimicrobial Resistance Proﬁles
Antibiotic sensitivity testing was performed for the 23 isolated
Salmonella strains, which included S. Enteritidis (n = 3),
S. Typhimurium (n = 2), S. Agona (n = 6), S. Anatum
(n = 3), S. London (n = 3), S. Newport (n = 3), S. Stanley
(n = 1), and S. Weltevreden (n = 2). As shown in Table 4,
three antibiotics gentamicin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and
tetracycline were eﬀective (100%) to all isolates. In this study,
resistance to erythromycin, penicillin and vancomycin were seen
in 100% of S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium, S. Agona, S. Anatum,
S. London, S. Newport, S. Stanley and S. Weltevreden isolates.
As shown in Table 5, the highest MAR index value of 0.56
was found in two S. Typhimurium isolates. Observation from
the presence study indicated that all Salmonella isolates were
multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains, which showed resistance to
three antibiotics (penicillin, vancomycin and erythromycin) or
more. Nine Salmonella isolates (39.13%) mainly from S. Agona
and S. Newport were resistant to four antibiotics, and three
S. Enteritidis (13.04%) were resistant to at least ﬁve of the
antibiotics.

Distribution of Virulence Genes among
Salmonella Isolates
All 23 Salmonella isolates were tested by PCR for the presence
of virulence genes. The invasion gene operon invA was detected
in all Salmonella isolates (Table 6). Regarding the diﬀerent
frequencies of hilA, sopB, and stn genes among diﬀerent serovars,
a clear diﬀerence was noticed in the occurrence of these genes
among the isolates; S. London and S. Stanley did not show the

of the 23 isolates tested (13.04%), comprising S. Enteritidis (one
isolate) and S. Typhimurium (two isolates). Overall, the serovars
tested showed at least three virulence-associated genes.

DISCUSSION

Results of investigations of retail beef meat samples do provide
an estimate of the prevalence of Salmonella in retail shops. The
high incidence of Salmonella in wet markets of the present
study indicated poor sanitary condition in the food processing
environment and lack of better personal hygiene of food handlers
during product preparation. High incidence of Salmonella in
wet markets was observed in the previous study of Thung et al.
(2016), who found higher prevalence of Salmonella in retail
chicken meat samples. An additional factor underlying potential
diﬀerences in prevalence between wet markets and hypermarkets
was that the storage temperature of the samples (Donado-Godoy
et al., 2012). Meanwhile, the presence of Salmonella in retail beef
meat might be due to the production system and conditions,

hygienic slaughter, and transport before sale. In this study, the
incidence of Salmonella in beef meat samples (9.58%, n = 240)
was higher than the incidence (2.16%, n = 417) in Poland
(Wieczorek and Osek, 2013) and less than the incidence (39.87%,
n = 158) in North Vietnam (Thai et al., 2012). This could be
due to the geographical variation such as climate and feed. On
the other hand, prevalence of Salmonella has been reported in
other food products in Malaysia. For example, Salmonella spp.
and S. Typhimurium were detected in sliced fruits (such as
papaya, watermelon, mango, sapodilla, jackfruit, dragon fruit and
honeydew) (Pui et al., 2011), and vegetables (such as cabbage,
carrot, capsicum, cucumber, lettuce and tomato) (Elexson et al.,
2011). Besides, Najwa et al. (2015) have shown that Salmonella
spp., S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis were detected in diﬀerent
types of local salad known as ulam (such as kacang botol, kacang
panjang, pegaga nyonya, and selom).

In the present study, a combined MPN-mPCR was used to
load (MPN/g) which can facilitate
quantify the microbial
the
enumeration of Salmonella spp., S. Enteritidis and
S. Typhimurium in the meat samples within a short period. The

described detection methods that successfully combined MPN
with mPCR to enumerate bacteria such as Campylobacter,
Listeria monocytogenus, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus in samples
(Kuan et al., 2017; Premarathne et al., 2017; Tan et al., 2017).
Worth to note that beef meat products by their nature, undergo
extensive processing and handling during their production,
may also increase the risk of contamination (Thung et al.,
2016). Typically, improper or ineﬀective cleaning of chopping
boards, tables and knives does play a role in harboring and
multiplying the organism. Cross-contamination may occur when
microorganisms are transferred from one surface to another,

possibly leading to contamination of other safe meat or clean
equipment. Salmonella contamination was common in retail
meats such as beef, pork and lamb, which could be a potential
vehicle for transmitting Salmonella to humans (Yang et al.,
2010). Thus, implementation and maintenance of some control
measures like the good manufacturing practices (GMP) and
hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP), as well as
further strengthening the education of food processors will be
necessary, for reducing Salmonella contamination.

Due to clinical signiﬁcance, determining or Salmonella
resistance or otherwise to antimicrobial agents is critical for

these antibiotics

treatment during outbreaks. High resistance of Salmonella
isolates to erythromycin, penicillin and vancomycin in this
ﬁnding are of clinical concern and could be the result
of widespread use of
in Selangor area.
Similarly, high percentage of penicillin and erythromycin
resistance were observed in diﬀerent Salmonella serovars
which isolated from retail meat products
such as beef
burger, ground beef and fresh beef (Sallam et al., 2014).
Interestingly, there were no Salmonella serovars resistant to
amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, gentamicin, kanamycin,
nalidixic acid, streptomycin, and tetracycline.
In contrast,
resistance to tetracycline was observed among the serovars of
S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium isolated from retail beef
meat samples (Yang et al., 2010). Previously, a study in China
demonstrated that all the Salmonella strains (n = 83) were
sensitive to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, while 98.80 and 92.77%
were observed for gentamicin and tetracycline, respectively
(Dong et al., 2014). In fact, MDR Salmonella serovars are
considered to be more virulent than non-MDR Salmonella
(Nayak et al., 2004; Dong et al., 2014). High percentages of
antimicrobial resistant Salmonella serovars from retail meat
products have been reported worldwide by several researchers
(Yang et al., 2010; Thai et al., 2012; Sallam et al., 2014). In
Malaysia, such observation was also reported by Geidam et al.
(2012), where they were able to detect MDR Salmonella in the
poultry environment in Selangor region. In this study, MDR
Salmonella isolates are prevalent in both retail markets. Hence,
more attention should be focused on the supervision and control
of antimicrobial use, typically in the agriculture and human
health care sectors in Malaysia.

Accordingly, the virulence of bacteria is inﬂuenced by both
antimicrobial resistance and the presence of virulence genes
(Huehn et al., 2010; Dong et al., 2014). The emergence of
MDR strains of Salmonella are mainly based on the factors
of genetic and biochemical mechanisms in order to enhance
their survivability by preserving their drug resistance genes
(Yang et al., 2010). Regarding the virulence factors that were
analyzed, S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium, S. Agona, S. Anatum,
S. Newport, and S. Weltevreden isolates showed a broader range
of pathogenicity determinants as compared to other serovars.
The most common virulence gene which present in Salmonella,
invA gene, was used as PCR target gene for detection of
Salmonella (Nayak et al., 2004; Dong et al., 2014). On the
other hand, an OmpR/ToxR transcriptional regulator encoded

by the hilA gene to activate the expression of invasion genes
was shown to play an important role in Salmonella virulence
(Cardona-Castro et al., 2002). In this study, the PCR screening
using hilA-targeted Salmonella-speciﬁc primers showed a clear
abundance of this virulence gene was detected in 19 of 23
analyzed strains (82.61%),
irrespective of their serovars. In
addition, similar results have been reported by Murugkar et al.
(2003) who found that the chromosomally encoded virulent
stn gene was widely distributed in all the isolated serovars.
This strengthens to our present ﬁnding; the stn gene was
prevalent among the isolated Salmonella serovars by PCR-based
assay (69.57%). Several studies have shown that the Salmonella
virulence plasmid plays an important role in human disease
(Swamy et al., 1996).

In summary, this study has shown that a combined MPN-
mPCR method was a reliable and useful for rapid screening of
Salmonella from retail beef meat. Our results indicate that retail
beef meat act as reservoirs in harboring multiple Salmonella
serovars, where cross-contamination might be occurred during
processing and at the retail
level. S. Agona was the most
common serotype found in retail beef. Moreover, the recovered
Salmonella isolates exhibiting multi-drug resistant and multiple
virulence genes, which constitute a possible risk to humans
from consumption of these products. Therefore, it is important
to manage the use of antimicrobial agents in livestock now,
to prevent the acquisition and increased resistance to recent
molecules in order to ﬁght against the vertical and horizontal
transfer of MDR strains. Alternatively,
is necessary for
developing more eﬀective intervention strategies such as green
control method using bacteriophages as controlling measure
in the food chain in order to reduce the risk of food-borne
diseases.
