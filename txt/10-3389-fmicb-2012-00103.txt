Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have emerged among livestock in sev-
eral countries. In this study, we describe the results of a screening performed in pigs and
raw pork samples in Thailand. Ten pork samples and 15 nasal swabs from pigs were col-
lected from 2 markets and 1 pig farm in the Samuth Songkhram province inThailand. MRSA
were isolated using selective isolation procedures and conﬁrmed by mecA PCR.The MRSA
were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, pulsed ﬁeld gel electrophoresis
(PFGE), spa typing, SCCmec typing, and MLST. Resistance and virulence markers were
screened using a microarray. Five of the pork samples and six pig nasal swabs were positive
for MRSA. All 11 isolates belonged to spa type t337 but showed diversity in antimicrobial
resistance patterns and PFGE proﬁles. Additionally, the isolates were sequence-typed; ST9,
ST2136, ST2278 belonging to the clonal complex; CC9. All isolates harbored SCCmec IX
and were resistant to 7 out of 14 tested antimicrobials; additional resistances to all antimi-
crobials tested were found in some of the pork and pig isolates and 1 pork isolate was
resistant to 13 antimicrobials tested. Microarray analysis identiﬁed blaZ, aac-aphD, vga(A),
tetM, and a tet efﬂux marker, in all strains and additionally ermB and aadD, cat and fex(A)
in the pork isolates. None of the isolates were found PVL-positive, but enterotoxins were
identiﬁed in all isolates. To our knowledge, only a few descriptions of MRSA in livestock
and food products inThailand have been observed but this is the ﬁrst observation of MRSA
CC9 associated with SCCmec IX in pork. This study indicates a likely widespread distrib-
ution of MRSA in pig and pork in Thailand and further investigation on the prevalence and
importance of livestock associated MRSA in Thailand is needed.

INTRODUCTION
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have recently
emerged in livestock, mainly pigs, but also in other animal species
(Catry et al., 2010). Most isolates have belonged to CC398, which
is also present in MSSA isolates from pigs (Voss et al., 2005;
van Belkum et al., 2008; Hasman et al., 2010), but other MRSA
clones have also been found in pigs in Europe and North Amer-
ica, including CC1, CC5, CC8, CC9, CC30, and CC971. In China
and Malaysia, isolates belonging to CC9 have been more fre-
quently observed (Cui et al., 2009; Neela et al., 2009). However
in South East Asia, there is still limited data on the occurrences
of MRSA in livestock. In this study, we present the ﬁrst descrip-
tion of MRSA isolated from pork in Thailand; S. aureus of spa
type t337 belonging to CC9, harboring the SCCmec element
type IX.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
BACTERIAL ISOLATES
The S. aureus included in this study were isolated from samples col-
lected the 10th of January 2011 from two open-air market shops
in the city of Samuth Songkhram and in one nearby pig farm
with breeding facilities, within the Samuth Songkhram province
in Thailand. By convenience sampling 10 pork samples of 25 g were
obtained from the market, 5 different cuts from each shop, and 15
nasal swabs from live pigs from the farm. Meat samples and nasal
swabs were inoculated in Mueller Hinton broth (Becton Dick-
inson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) supplemented with 6.5% NaCl
(225 and 10 mL, respectively) which was incubated at 37± 1˚C for
18–24 h. One milliliter of MH culture was transferred to Tryp-
tone Soya Broth (TSB; Oxoid, Cambridge, UK) supplemented
with 4 mg/L cefoxitin and 75 mg/L aztreonam, and incubated at
37± 1˚C in 18–24 h. Ten microliters was streaked on Brilliance
MRSA agar (Oxoid, Cambridge, UK) and incubated at 37± 1˚C
for 24–48 h. Presumptive MRSA colonies were identiﬁed as denim

blue colonies and these colonies were isolated on blood agar plates
and thereafter kept frozen at −70˚C until further examination.

ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING
MIC testing was performed using a commercially prepared, dehy-
drated panel, Sensititre, from TREK Diagnostic Systems, Ltd.
(East Grinstead, England). The following antimicrobials and epi-
demiological cut-off values or clinical breakpoints were used in
the study: cefoxitin, FOX (R > 4 mg/L); chloramphenicol, CHL
(R > 16 mg/L); ciproﬂoxacin, CIP (R > 1 mg/L); erythromycin,
ERY (R > 1 mg/L); ﬂorfenicol, FFN (R > 8 mg/L); gentamicin,
GEN (R > 2 mg/L); penicillin, PEN (R > 0.125 mg/L); spectin-
omycin, SPE (R > 64 mg/L); streptomycin, STR (R > 16 mg/L);
sulfamethoxazole, SMX (R > 128 mg/L);
tetracycline, TET
(R > 1 mg/L);
trimethoprim,
sulfamethoxazole+ trimethoprim, SXT
TMP (R > 8 mg/L);
(R > 2 mg/L). The quinolone-resistant determining region
(QRDR) regions of staphylococcal topoisomerase genes were
ampliﬁed and sequenced in one isolate; 3-P7 (N) using the primers
described by Schmitz et al. (1998).

tiamulin, TIA (R > 16 mg/L);

DETECTION OF THE mecA GENE, spa-, AND SCCmec TYPES
The presence of the mecA gene was determined using a multi-
plex PCR directed against the 16S ribosomal RNA (presence of
DNA), the mecA gene, and the nucA gene (presence of S. aureus)
as described previously by Maes et al. (2002). MRSA isolates were
spa – typed using a conventional PCR assay described by Hasman
et al. (2010), and a multiplex PCR was performed to identify the
SCCmec cassette (Kondo et al., 2007).

MLST TYPING
MLST was performed by the method previously described by
Enright et al. (2000), on all of isolates. The individual MLST types
were assigned to the speciﬁc CC types utilizing the eBURST2.

PULSED FIELD GEL ELECTROPHORESIS
Pulsed ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed according
to Murchan et al. (2003) using SmaI restriction. The comparative
analysis of the PFGE proﬁles was performed by using the Bionu-
merics software version 4.6 (Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem,
Belgium) and the Dice correlation coefﬁcient for band matching
with a 1.0% position tolerance and an optimization at 1.0%.

GENOTYPING
All isolates were characterized using the Identibac Staphylococcus
aureus genotyping microarray performed at the Alere Laborato-
ries (Alere Labs; Jena, Germany), investigating the presence of
resistance genes and virulence markers. The array results were
interpreted according to manufacturer recommendations.

RESULTS
Among the 25 samples, 11 isolates; 5 from raw pork and 6 from
pigs were isolated, identiﬁed as MRSA and conﬁrmed to harbor
the mecA gene. The mecA gene was carried on the SCCmec element
type IX. Among the isolates only a single spa type was identiﬁed;

t337. MLST typing revealed the pork isolate as belonging to three
MLST types; ST2136 (n = 3), ST9 (n = 1), and ST2278 (n = 1)
where the pig isolates belonged to ST2136 (n = 5) and ST9 (n = 1)
but both within CC9 (Figure 1). ST2278 was assigned as a new
MLST types not previously observed. ST9 and ST2278 both dif-
fered with one allelic difference compared to the predominating
MLST; ST2136 in this study.

A high level of antimicrobial resistance was observed among all
of the MRSA isolates showing resistance to 7 out of the 14 antimi-
crobials tested (Figure 1). This included FOX, CIP, GEN, PEN,
TET, TIA, and TMP, respectively. All ﬁve pork isolates conferred
resistance to both CHL and FFN. Additionally, four (80%) of the
ﬁve pork isolates also conferred resistance to ERY (Figure 1).

The genotypic characterization of the strains showed the pres-
ence of blaZ, aac-aphD, vga(A), tetM, and a tet efﬂux marker,
besides the mecA gene. Some of the pork samples were found
additionally positive to ermB and aadD, cat and fex(A).

Two single base-pair substitutions were identiﬁed in the QRDRs
of one of the pig isolates resistant to ciproﬂoxacin. The isolate had
a mutation at codon 84 (TCA [Ser]→ TTA [Leu]) in gyrA and
codon 80 (TCC [Ser]→ TTC [Phe]) in grlA. All pig strains and
some pork meat strains harbored several enterotoxin genes (entG,
entI, entM, entN, and entO). PVL, TSST-1, and exfoliative toxins
were not found in any of the isolates (Table 1).

Pulsed ﬁeld gel electrophoresis revealed a high diversity among
the 11 isolates with eight unique SmaI patterns divided into two
groups (pork and pigs) deﬁned by 75% similarity. Three PFGE
clusters with indistinguishable types were observed, of which one
cluster consisted of isolates from two raw pork isolates displaying a
different antimicrobial resistance proﬁle. The two remaining clus-
ters consisted of pairs of pork isolates with identical antimicrobial
resistance patterns, by pairs (Figure 1).

DISCUSSION
Methicillin resistance in livestock associated MRSA (LA-MRSA)
has mostly been related to ST398 carrying the SCCmec IV and V
elements (Catry et al., 2010). However, CC9 MRSA has been found
as the dominant subtype in isolates originating from pigs in Asia;
China, and Malaysia where the isolates contained the SCCmec III
and SCCmec V, respectively (Cui et al., 2009; Neela et al., 2009).
We conﬁrmed this observation as all isolates in this study were
spa type t337 and MLST of the isolates conﬁrmed its association
with CC9.

Recently, a novel SCCmec element; IX was described related to
CC398 in a healthy human originating from Thailand (Li et al.,
2011). We found that pig and pork isolates belonging to CC9-
related MLST type and of spa type t337 have acquired the same
SCCmec element IX.

This speciﬁc genotype has recently only been described in
another study where four pigs from a farm situated in Lampoon
province, Thailand belonged to ST9/t337 carrying the ccrAB type
1 and mec class C2 equivalent to SCCmec element IX (Anukool
et al., 2011). This ﬁnding strongly supports that LA-MRSA belong-
ing to CC9-related MLST type and of spa type t337 has acquired
the SCCmec element IX in Thailand.

The ﬁnding of pork isolates clustering separately from isolates
from live animals is likely a consequence of the small sample

The following genes confer resistance to: 1penicillin; 2erythromycin; 3gentamicin; 4tiamulin; 5tetracycline; 6chloramphenicol; 7ﬂorfenicol; 8enterotoxins. The isolates

sizes. Thus, there is no evidence if the pig farm were supplier
to the shops at the market. However, this hypothesis needs to be
further elucidated, as does the potential importance for human
health.

In addition to the acquired methicillin resistance, the isolates
conferred resistance to several antimicrobial agents including crit-
ical important antimicrobials for human health. In comparison
to the antimicrobial resistance proﬁle of the four pig isolates
described by Anukool et al., we found similar high level of resis-
tance to macrolides and chloramphenicol. However, this high
frequency was only observed in pig isolates in contrast to the pork
isolates where no resistances to these compounds were observed.
In the study by Anukool et al. (2011) the authors suggest based
on a negative result testing for the presence of the cfr gene that
cat genes should be responsible for resistance to chloramphenicol.
We however, found that the fexA gene was present in 80% of the
tested pig isolates and only one isolate harbored cat genes. The
high antimicrobial resistant proﬁle among the isolates might be a
result of the high selective pressure to antimicrobials used in the

agriculture sector (Carlet et al., 2011). This hypothesis is supported
by the genetic diversity indicating that the isolates have been in the
reservoir for some time. The resistant nature of these isolates and
the harbored enterotoxins pose a great concern as they may cause
problems in the treatment of humans with S. aureus infections.
Likewise, MRSA might also pose a threat by possible spread into
the community either by direct occupational contact to animals
or by a more remote hypothesis of foodborne transmission.

In this study, we described the spread of the mecA gene to the
S. aureus spa type t337 CC9, harbored on the novel SCCmec IX
element. We advocate the Thai authorities to embark on a broader
investigation to measure the prevalence of LA-MRSA and to assess
what actions to initiate in respect of control and prevention of the
MRSA among livestock.
