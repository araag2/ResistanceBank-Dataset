ABSTRACT

Staphylococcus  aureus  is  widespread  in  animal-origin  food,  particularly  for  raw  chicken  meat 

products because of the direct exposure and cross-contamination at the breeding, slaughtering and 

processing, transporting, storing and marketing stages. This study aims to determine the S. aureus 

prevalence, antibiotic resistance (routine animal used and nosocomial treatment antibiotics) and 

genetic  characterization  (e.g.  frequently  used  molecular  typing  methods  for  Staphylococcus 

aureus, enterotoxin series, panton valentine leukocidin, toxic shock syndrome) among various raw 

chicken  meat  products.  In  total,  464  raw  chicken  meat  products  were  collected  in  a  variety  of 

conditions:  from  local  supermarkets  and  wet  markets;  between  summer  and  winter;  of  cut  and 

whole carcass product types; stored at both low temperature and room temperature; and in both 

packed and unpacked states. The overall prevalence of S. aureus was 11.5%, contamination level 

of  S.  aureus  among  different  products  types  maintained  102-104  CFU/g,  clonal  complex  (CC)5 

was the most common CC in various products (74.2%); every sequence type (ST) corresponded to

a single spa type, remarkably, spa typing did not show further discrimination based on MLST. 

Toxin genetic distribution showed the existence of diverse atypical enterotoxin genes, sea, pvl and 

tst  as  classical  and  critical  toxin  factors  were  absent  in  these  isolates.  Whereas,  penicillin-  and 

tetracycline-resistant  isolates  were  common  in  products  with  skin,  cuts,  particularly,  extremely 

strong  biofilm  formation  isolates  were  found  in  products  with  skin.  Our  investigation  indicates 

that  cutting  process  and  packing  were  the  key  factors  for  the  contamination  of  S.  aureus, 

suggesting  a  possible  critical  control  points  in  processing  and  marketing  stages.  Though  a 

relatively  low  toxin  genetic  existence  suggests  low  virulence,  routine  antibiotic  resistance  and 

high biofilm formation existence raise the need for concern over possibility of human infection.

1. Introduction

Staphylococcus  aureus  is  a  human  and  animal  host-specific  pathogen  involved  in  multiple 

diseases  (Visciano,  et  al.,  2014).  It  is  regarded  as  one  of  the  world’s  leading  causes  of  food 

consumption-related  disease  outbreaks  (Schelin,  et  al.,  2011).  Enterotoxic  S.  aureus  produces 

multiple heat-stable extracellular enterotoxins which may lead to pathogenicity in Ready-To-Eat 

(RTE)  foods  and  Ready-To-Cook  (RTC)  foods,  common  symptoms  of  Staphylococcal  food 

poisoning (SFP) are vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping and exhaustion (Ertas Onmaz, et al., 

2015;  Normanno,  et  al.,  2005;  Puah,  Chua,  &  Tan,  2016;  Song,  et  al.,  2015).  Currently, 

documented  food-borne  outbreaks  of  S.  aureus  intoxications  are  mostly  associated  with 

consumption of contaminated food (Fetsch, et al., 2014; Kerouanton, et al., 2007).

Raw chicken meat products as the worldwide leaders in consumed RTC meat are common in 

slaughterhouses of all sizes (Abdalrahman, Stanley, Wells, & Fakhr, 2015), because of the daily 

massive consumption, these products constitute a high potentiality of SFP through contamination 

in further processing. As such, raw chicken meat products are uniquely predisposed to becoming 

vehicles for potential transmission of pathogenic S. aureus to humans via food chain. Moreover, 

the  amount  of  pathogenic  S.  aureus  recovered  from  food  remnants  is  generally  recognized  to 

require a presence greater than 105 CFU/g to cause SFP (Fetsch, et al., 2014), depending on the 

toxigenicity of the S.aureus strain, initial contamination level in processing units, transportation 

time  and  temperature,  and  the  environmental  conditions  of  terminal  marketing  (Soriano,  Font, 

54 Moltó, & Mañes, 2002). In addition, regarding public infections, multidrug resistance (MDR) is an

emerging  concern  among  all  kinds  of  food-origin  meat  (Petternel,  et  al.,  2014),  especially  for 

antibiotics abuse at feeding stage.

S. aureus presents an extensive sequence typing diversity associated with seven housekeeping 

genes (arcC, aroE, glpF, gmk, pta, tpi and yqiL), Staphylococcal protein A (spa), and virulence 

genetic  diversity  such  as  staphylococcal  enterotoxins  (se),  toxic  shock  syndrome  toxin  (tst), 

extracellular thermo-stable nuclease (nuc), β-lactamase (bla), staphylococcal cassette chromosome 

mec (SCCmec), and accessory gene regulators (agr) (Argudin, et al., 2012; Carfora, et al., 2015; 

de Boer, et al., 2009; Omoe, et al., 2002; Zhang, et al., 2011). Enterotoxin genes acquired through 

inheritance  or  horizontal  transformation,  form  pathogenic  islands  grouped  as  enterotoxin  gene 

clusters  (egc)  or  organized  as  an  operon.  Additionally,  antimicrobial  resistance  is  conditionally 

acquired via plasmids or thansposons carrying antibiotic resistance genes or mutations, especially 

methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) harboring methcillin-resistant (mec) gene, can be grouped

according to SCCmec typing (Song, et al., 2015).

Therefore,  it  is  important  to  investigate  the  prevalence,  antimicrobial  resistance  and  genetic 

diversity  of  S.  aureus  in  chicken  meat  products  at  a  retail  level  among  diverse  marketing  and 

storage conditions. The basic data of S. aureus contamination in raw chicken meat products would 

contribute to improve the microbial quality of such products. Samples were classified based on 

different markets, brands (including nameless and well-known brands), cutting and packing types 

to determine their influence on the contamination of S. aureus.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Sample collection

Out of 464 raw chicken meat samples were collected from randomly selected supermarkets and 

wet  markets  in  Nanjing,  China,  Samples  were  chosen  with  the  aim  of  obtaining  a  variety  of 

brands,  markets,  cuts  (breast,  wings,  drumsticks  and  whole  carcass)  and  storage  conditions.  In 

supermarkets, raw chicken meat products were stored on ice, and in refrigerators with or without 

tray packing. In wet markets, unpacked raw chicken meat products were frozen or stored at room 

temperature (RT). Each sample was transported to the laboratory on ice in sterilized bag in order 

to avoid cross-contamination.

2.2. Quantification of S.aureus

Quantification of coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS) was performed as described by 

China’s National food Safety Standard-Food for microbiological examination of S. aureus 

(GB4789.10-2010). Briefly, 25 g of product was mixed with 225 ml sterilized saline and 

homogenized in a stomacher masticator, then homogenates were serially diluted with sterilized 

saline. Subsequently, 0.3 ml, 0.3 ml and 0.4 ml of each dilution was streaked onto Baird Parker

agar with 5% egg yolk and tellurite emulsion (Beijing Land Bridge Tech Co., Ltd., China), 

thereafter, 2 or 3 consecutive dilutions were chosen for each sample, with 37℃  cultivation for 48 

h. Typical S. aureus colonies based on morphology were counted for calculation. 

The formulae for quantification were as described below:

a- Only one dilution had colonies in consecutive dilutions.

b- The low dilution selected has more than 200 colonies, while following high dilutions have 

fewer than 20 colonies.

The two above conditions accorded:

T=ABC𝑑

where  T  is  S.  aureus  colonies  in  sample,  A  is  typical  colonies  at  one  dilution,  B  is  coagulase 

positive colonies at one dilution, C is colonies subjected to coagulase test at one dilution, and d is 

the dilution factor.

c- Consecutive dilutions both had 20-200 colonies accord:

T=(A1B1/C1+A2B2/C2)1.1𝑑

where T is S. aureus colonies in sample, A1 and A2 are typical colonies at low dilution and high 

dilution respectively, B1 and B2 are coagulase positive colonies at low dilution and high dilution 

respectively. C1 and C2 are colonies subjected to coagulase test at low dilution and high dilution 

respectively, 1.1 is the coefficient, and d is the dilution factor (low dilution).

2.3. Identification of S. aureus

For  further  exact  identification  of  S.  aureus,  3–5  presumptive  colonies  on  each  plate  were 

picked  to  inoculate  TSB  medium  for  overnight  culturing  at  37℃,  carried  out  with  VITEK2 

automated system (BioMerieux, France), and hemolytic and coagulase test (Beijing Land Bridge

Technology LTD., China). Genomic DNA of S. aureus isolates were extracted and purified using 

commercial bacteria DNA extraction and purification kits (Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd., China). S. 

aureus genus specific primers (multiplex PCR targeting nuc1, coa and staphylococcal specific 16S 

rRNA) were used for molecular identification (Perillo, et al., 2012).

2.4. Molecular typing

PCR for Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) and Staphylococcal protein A (spa) typing of 

recovered S. aureus were performed according to public primers (synthesized by Sango Co., Ltd., 

China)  and  procedures.  Amplicons  were  sequenced  followed  by  sequences  alignment  on  the 

119 MLST  website  (http://www.mlst.net)  and  Ridom  Spa  Server  (http://spaserver.ridom.de/)

separately.  Further  analysis  for  clonal  complexes  (CC)  of  allelic  types  was  also  defined  as 

described  previously  (Normanno,  G.,  2015).  In  addition,  agr  genotyping  was  carried  out  as 

described  by  (Song,  et  al.,  2015),  and  staphylococcal  cassette  SCCmec  types  for  methicillin-

resistant  Staphylococcus  aureus  (MRSA)  were  analyzed  using  multiplex  PCR  as  described 

previously (Zhang, et al., 2011).

2.5. Virulence and antimicrobial resistance genetic characterization

Virulence  and  antimicrobial  resistance  genetic  characterization  of  S.  aureus  isolates  were 

screened by simplex PCR assay for eighteen enterotoxins (sea, seb, sec, sed, see, seg, seh, sei, sej, 

sek, sel, sem, sen, seo, sep, seq, ser, seu), panton-valentine leucocidin (pvl), exfoliatins (eta, etb, 

etd), toxic shock syndrome toxin (tst), and penicillin (blaZ) and methicillin resistance (mecA). The 

colistin  resistant  gene  mcr-1  was  also  considered  for  its  horizontal  transfer  potentiality  in  wild 

complex  microfora  (Liu,  et  al.,  2016).  Primers  used  are  listed  in  Table  1.  Amplicon  of  each

2.6. Antimicrobial susceptibility

Out  of  12  antimicrobial  agents  were  selected  for  standardized  disc  diffusion  test  on  Muller-

Hinton  agar.  These  commercial  discs  were  vancomycin  (30  μg),  chloromycetin  (30  μg), 

clindamycin (2 μg), gentamicin (10 μg), kanamycin (30 μg), streptomycin (10 μg), tetracycline (30 

μg), erythromycin (15 μg), penicillin (10 U), oxacillin (1 μg) and spectinomycin (100 μg). ATCC 

25923 was used as quality control. Breakpoints were established for each antibiotic according to 

the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, 2014), and MDR (Multi Drug Resistance) 

was defined as three or more classes of antibiotic resistance or methicillin resistance (Petternel, et 

al., 2014).

2.7. Biofilm formation in vitro

The biofilm-forming ability (BFA) was assayed using TSB culturing in polystyrene microtiter 

plates,  followed  by  crystal  violet  dying  procedure  adhering  to  standards  set  out  in  a  previous 

report (Vázquez-Sánchez, Cabo, Ibusquiza, & Rodríguez-Herrera, 2014) with slight modification. 

Culture condition was 37℃  for 48 h, optimal density (OD) at 595 nm wavelength was measured 

at  the  end  time  point,  and  ATCC  6538  was  used  as  biofilm  positive  control  (Peeters,  Nelis,  & 

Coenye,  2008).  Three  independent  experiments  were  performed  in  triplicate.  BFA  was  assayed 

using formulae based on previously reports (Ruiz, Barragan, Sesena, & Palop, 2016):

BFA=(𝑎 -𝑐)(𝑏 -𝑐)

where strong BFA was defined as value  ＞2; a, b and c are OD values of isolates, ATCC 6538 

and blank well as positive and negative control respectively. 

2.8. Statistical analysis

The quantification of CPS was graphed using GraphPad prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc.,

USA),SPSS 17.0 were employed for statistical analysis as follow: a Pearson’s chi-square test was 

carried  out  for  comparison  of  prevalence  of  CPS,  one-way  ANOVA  was  used  to  test  the 

significant difference of quantification of CPS. eBUST v.3 was used for locus variant analysis by 

allelic types of MLST, and the Fisher exact test was used for genetic distribution among different 

products categories. Significant difference was determined at a 5% confidence interval.

3. Results

3.1. Prevalence and quantification of CPS

As shown in Table 2, out of 464 raw chicken meat products collected from local supermarkets 

(288) and wet markets (176), 53 (11.5%) samples showed the presence of CPS as determined by 

BP-EY agar, hemolytic and coagulase tests. A Chi-squared test of independence indicated that the 

overall prevalence of CPS in supermarkets (37/288) and in wet markets (16/176) did not differ 

significantly (p＞0.05). Because there was no significant difference between them, samples from 

supermarkets and wet markets were combined for further analysis. The prevalence of CPS did not 

differ significantly (p＞0.05) between packed and unpacked products, or between those stored at 

room  temperature  and  low  temperature.  However,  there  was  a  significant  difference  (p＜0.05) 

between products with skin (drumstick, wings and whole carcass products) and products without 

skin, also between cuts (drumstick, wings and breast) and whole carcass products.

According to China’s National Food Safety Standard-Food microbiological examination of S. 

aureus  (GB4789.10-2010),  the  population  of  S.  aureus  was  quantified  as  a  range  of  different 

values for each different categories of raw chicken meat. As showed in Fig.1, all types remained 

the  contamination  level  range  from102  to  104  CFU/g.  comparatively,  Refrigerated  types  had 

significant  lower  contamination  compared  to  RT  stored  products  (p＜0.05),  among  them,

unpacked  types  showed  significant  higher  contamination  compared  to  packed  ones  (p＜0.05). 

Nevertheless, RT stored types were only sold in wet markets, the influence of setting cannot be 

differentiated between supermarkets and wet markets, moreover, cuts and whole carcass, products 

with and without skin had no significant difference in various contamination levels. 

3.2. Genotypes

Previous studies which have characterized S. aureus isolates from food-related materials have 

rarely regarded the overlap among these isolates (Merz, Stephan, & Johler, 2016; Normanno, et 

al.,  2007;  Perillo,  et  al.,  2012).For  several  typical  colonies  using  the  method  of  molecular 

distribution on a single plate, the only discrimination made was antibiotics susceptibility profiles 

(Perillo, et al., 2012). To avoid repeats during calculation, our study defined a single S. aureus 

isolate  based  on  ST,  spa  type,  agr  type,  antimicrobial  resistance  and  virulence  genes  profiles. 

Totally,  31  single  strains  were  determined  among  53  CPS,  as  shown  in  Table  3,  31  isolates 

grouped into six MLST types. The most prevalent genotype was ST1 (16/31), followed by ST12 

(6/31), ST2315 (3/31), ST5 (2/31), ST7 (2/31) and ST8 (2/31). eBURST v.3 analysis showed that 

ST1, ST5, ST8 and ST2315 were grouped into one CC5, but ST7 and ST12 were solely founded 

by CC7 and CC12 respectively. Every ST corresponded to a single spa type. ST1 corresponded to 

t127, ST5 to t002, ST7 to t091, ST8 to t9101, ST12 to t213 and ST2315 to t11687. In addition, 

agr typing revealed that, ⅠⅡ and Ⅲ types were identified in isolates except typeⅣ, Ⅲ type was 

the most common agr type (16/31), followed by typeⅡ (11/31) and type Ⅰ (8/31).

   Regarding  genotypes  distribution  among  different  products  types,  since  each  ST  type  had 

consistent one-to-one match with spa type, the distribution of genotypes were considered based on 

CC.  Overall,  isolates  from  diverse  product  types  exhibited  a  high  degree  of  heterogeneity,  the

existence of CC5 were found in every product type. Cuts had higher existence of CC5 compared 

with whole carcasses; same results were obtained in packed types compared with unpacked types, 

products with or without skin, refrigerated and RT stored types. CC12 was mainly distributed in 

refrigerated and unpacked types.

For  toxic  gene  distribution,  seh  (16/31),  sec  (10/31)  and  sel  (10/31)  had  relatively  higher 

existence  among  isolates,  compared  with  other  enterotoxins  genes  seb,  seg,  sei,  sem,  sen  and 

seo(all  less  than  5/31).  Notably,  sea,  tst  and  pvl  as  classical  toxin  genes  were  absent  in  these 

isolates, sek, seq or seu were absent neither. Meanwhile, common presence of bla (27/31) geneand 

absence of mec gene confirmed the antibiotic susceptibility. For toxic gene distribution in products 

categories, regarding combined calculation of prevalence of CPS, both number and diversity of 

toxin genes in cuts or low temperature products were shown to be significantly higher than whole 

chicken or room temperature products, especially for sec, seh, and sel.

3.3. Antimicrobial susceptibility

Antimicrobial  susceptibility  testing  showed  that  all  S.aureus  isolates  were  susceptible  to 

gentamycin, oxacillin, cefaclor and vancomycin. Antibiotics Resistance associated with product 

types are shown in Table 4, 27 (87.1%) and 26 (83.9%) of 31 isolates were resistant to penicillin 

and  tetracycline  respectively,  followed  by  11  (35.5%)  isolates  resistant  to  ciprofloxacin,  10 

(32.3%)  to  erythromycin.  Only  several  isolates  were  resistant  to  streptomycin  (9.7%), 

chloromycetin  (9.7%),  clindamycin  (3.2%)  and  kanamycin  (3.2%).  In  addition,  15  (48.4%) 

isolates showed MDR phenotypes like TC-P-CIP, TC-P-E, TC-CIP-E, TC-P-CIP-E and S-TC-P 

resistance.

A combined comparison was carried out in products categories, it showed that tetracycline and

erythromycin  resistance  rates  are  significantly  higher  in  skin,  cuts  and  low  temperature  stored 

products compared with breast, whole carcass and room temperature products respectively. The 

existence of penicillin resistance was significantly higher in skin and low temperature products 

than  in  breast  and  room  temperature  products;  however,  other  antibiotic  resistances  were 

randomly distributed because of low performance of resistance.

3.4. Biofilm formation ability

As shown in Table 5, six isolates showed strong BFA, while the BFA of other isolates were 

either similar to ATCC 6538 or biofilm-forming negative (data not shown). Among them, two 

isolates (Sa02 and Sa05) had extremely strong BFA which were both isolated from chicken meat 

products with skin, found in supermarket and wet market respectively.

4. Discussion

Studies  of  S.aureus  related  to  food  generally  focus  on  fish,  dairy,  poultry,  livestock  and 

handling  contacts  (Carfora,  et  al.,  2015;  de  Boer,  et  al.,  2009;  Li,  Wu,  Wang,  &  Meng,  2015; 

Lozano, Gharsa, Ben Slama, Zarazaga, & Torres, 2016; Normanno, et al., 2005; Normanno, et al., 

2007; Simon & Sanjeev, 2007; Yan, et al., 2012). In the past decade, though relevant reports have 

demonstrated that the high prevalence of S.aureus in chicken products (Abdalrahman, et al., 2015; 

Fijalkowski,  Peitler,  &  Karakulska,  2016;  Thapaliya,  et  al.,  2017),  different  processing  units, 

storage temperature, retailing environment and product types may cause a diverse contamination 

level of S. aureus, which has rarely been considered in previous studies. Therefore, there is a great 

practical  significance  to  the  investigation  of  the  prevalence  of  S.aureus  among  various  raw 

chicken meat products according to different environmental conditions.

The results of this study indicated that different retail environments (i.e. supermarkets and wet

markets)  had  no  significant  influence  on  the  prevalence  of  CPS  in  raw  chicken  meat  samples. 

Significant  difference  of  prevalence  of  CPS  occurred  between  room  temperature  and  low 

temperature stored products, same result was obtained in the quantification of CPS, presumably, 

this  is  because  environmental  temperature  has  a  critical  influence  on  the  growth  of  bacteria. 

Besides, there were significant differences of prevalence of CPS between products with or without 

skin, cuts or whole carcass, this indicates that original contamination of CPS in processing units is 

the  decisive  influential  factor  in  CPS  contamination  (Normanno,  et  al.,  2005;  Soriano,  et  al., 

2002), particularly because of cross-contamination between handling, equipment contact surface 

and  meat  surface  (Habib,  et  al.,  2012;  You,  et  al.,  2016).  The  quantification  of  CPS  among 

different  products  indicated  that  packing  process  is  the  main  cause  of  significant  difference  of 

contamination  level  of  CPS  among  various  types.  In  brief,  the  key  factors  influencing 

contamination  of  S.aureus  on  raw  chicken  meat  were  cutting  and  packing  processes,  each  of 

which was significant. This study’s findings should be used to highlight processing and storing 

standards  considering  these  condition  changes  had  an  effect  on  the  microflora  of  meat,  that  is, 

cutting and packing process was the main influential factors because further handling processes 

have increased the opportunity for cross-contamination (Ertas Onmaz, et al., 2015).

Quantification  of  S.  aureus  revealed  that  S.  aureus  isolated  from  samples  show  a  highly 

similarity of molecular typing, CC5 and t127 were widely distributed in every type of products, 

which is in agreement with previously report (Merz, et al., 2016), however, spa typing did not 

show a further discrimination compared with ST typing (KITAI, et al., 2005). Different sampling 

markets  and  package  types  had  no  influence  on  the  genotype  distribution  among  products 

categories.  As  for  virulence  gene  detection,  the  prevalence  of  atypical  enterotoxins,  and  the

absence of classical toxin genes including sea, pvl and tst, revealed a relatively less toxigenicity 

compared  with  previous  reports  associated  with  chicken  meat  products  (Abdalrahman,  et  al., 

2015; Fijalkowski, et al., 2016; Lozano, et al., 2016; Song, et al., 2015; Wang, et al., 2013).

As  for  phenotypic  characterization  of  antimicrobial  resistance  and  BFA,  Antimicrobial 

susceptibility  tests  showed  a  general  penicillin  and  tetracycline  resistance  and  frequent  MDR, 

which is in agreement with previous studies (Jamali, Paydar, Radmehr, Ismail, & Dadrasnia, 2015; 

Puah,  et  al.,  2016;  Thapaliya,  et  al.,  2017),  suggested  an  increasing  common  penicillin  and 

tetracycline  resistance  in  S.  aureus  isolated  from  food-related  samples  worldwide.  More 

importantly,  the  presence  of  nearly  half  of  isolates  showed  MDR  and  extremely  strong  BFA 

isolates need to be highly concerned regarding the possibility of severe infections.

In  summary,  low  prevalence  and  virulence  genetic  existence  of  S.  aureus  among  different 

chicken  meat  products  at  retail  level  was  mostly  attributed  to  the  holistic  improvements  in  the 

handling and sanitary procedures (Bai, Ma, Yang, Zhao, & Gong, 2007), and adaptation of Good 

278 Manufacturing  Practices  (GMP)  and  Hazard  Analysis  and  Critical  Control  Points  (HACCP)  in

processing units (Jin, Zhou, & Ye, 2008; Soriano, et al., 2002; Tompkin, 1994). In addition, the 

wide  application  of  cold  chain  logistics  conception  (particularly  with  RFID  [Radio  Frequency 

Identification]  technology)  ensured  the  effective  control  of  microbial  growth  from  processing 

units  to  terminal  marketing  (Raab,  et  al.,  2008;  TANG  &  QIAN,  2008).  These  developed 

decontamination and hygienic strategies provided an efficient microbial control among the whole 

poultry meat processing chain, guaranteeing a low homogeneous S. aureus contamination in raw 

chicken meat products.
