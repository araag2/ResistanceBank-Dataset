Abstract The aims of this study were to determine the prev-
alence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC)
strains in pigs as a possible STEC reservoir in India as well
as to characterize the STEC strains and to determine the
antimicrobial resistance pattern of the strains. A total of 782
E. coli isolates from clinically healthy (n=473) and diarrhoeic
piglets (309) belonging to major pig-producing states of India
were screened by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay
for the presence of virulence genes characteristic for STEC,
that is, Shiga toxin-producing gene(s) (stx1, stx2), intimin
(eae), enterohemolysin (hlyA) and STEC autoagglutinating
adhesin (Saa). Overall STEC were detected in 113 (14.4 %)
piglets, and the prevalence of E. coli O157 and non-O157
STEC were 4 (0.5 %) and 109 (13.9 %), respectively. None of
the O157 STEC isolates carried gene encoding for H7 antigen
(fliCh7). The various combinations of virulence genes present
in the strains studied were stx1 in 4.6 %, stx1 in combination
with stx2 gene in 5.1 %, stx1 in combination with stx2 and
ehxA in 0.6 %, stx1 in combination with stx2 and eae in 0.2 %
and stx2 alone in 3.7 %. All STEC isolates were found
negative for STEC autoagglutinating adhesin (Saa). The num-
ber of STEC isolates which showed resistance to antimicro-
bials such as ampicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, lincomy-
cin, nalidixic acid, sulfadiazine, penicillin, gentamicin, kana-
mycin and ceftriaxone were 100, 99, 98, 97, 95, 94, 92, 88, 85
and 85, respectively. Ninety-seven isolates showed resistance
to more than 2 antimicrobials, and 8 resistance groups (R1 to
R8) were observed. This study demonstrates that pigs in India
harbour both O157 and non-O157 STEC, and this may pose
serious public health problems in future.

Introduction

Pig farming in India constitutes the livelihood of rural poor
belonging to the lowest socio-economic strata. Pig is consid-
ered as one of the best meat-producing animals in the world.
In India, meat production is now the fastest-growing segment
of livestock sector, and the consumption of pork is increasing
significantly in the country, particularly in the North Eastern
States where country’s 40 % pig population exists (Livestock
Census 2007).

Escherichia coli O157:H7 and other Shiga toxin (Stx)-
producing E. coli (STEC) strains are associated with food
and waterborne illness around the world (Karmali et al.
2010). E. coli O157 has been implicated as the causative agent
in several human outbreaks and is the most common cause of
hemorrhagic colitis (HC) and hemolytic uremic syndrome
(HUS). Non-O157 STEC strains have more recently been
recognized as important pathogens with an increasing impact
on human health and are now also considered to be a major
cause of disease (Chase-Topping et al. 2012). The ability of
STEC to cause disease is related to the production of one or
more Shiga-like toxins (Stx1, Stx2 or their variants), which
inhibits protein synthesis of host cells, thus leading to cell
death (Growther et al. 2013). In addition to toxin production,
another virulence-associated factor expressed by STEC is a
protein called intimin (encoded by the chromosomal gene
eae), which is responsible for the intimate attachment of
STEC to intestinal epithelial cells, causing effacing lesions
in the intestinal mucosa (Helmy et al. 2013). The large plas-
mid of STEC O157 carries determinant characteristic for
STEC that presumably harbour additional virulence factors:
hlyA (the enterohemorrhagic E. coli hemolysin gene), which

acts as a pore-forming cytolysin on eukaryotic cells (Schmidt
et al. 1995). The pathogenic capacity of STEC also resides in
virulence factor such as STEC autoagglutinating adhesin
(Saa) (Gyles 2007).

STEC strains have been isolated from a variety of animals
and healthy cattle, and other ruminants appear to be the main
reservoir of STEC strains (Durand et al. 2010). It has been
reported that pigs routinely carry STEC and high (9.5 %)
prevalence of EC O157 in swine faeces was noted in South
Africa (Witold and Carolyn 2011). Pig as a potential reservoir
of STEC O157:H7 has also been reported from Japan
(Nakazawa et al. 1999). Faecal contamination of the farm
environment favours animal reinfection and persistence of
the pathogen in the farm. Hence, production units represent
a major reservoir for STEC and human infection occurs pri-
marily via faecal contamination of food products or by inges-
tion of untreated water contaminated with livestock wastes
and slurries (Fairbrother and Nadeau 2006). Therefore, to
reduce the risk of human infection, it is critical to reduce
bacterial population in the live animal at the primary produc-
tion level before entry to the slaughterhouse.

As E. coli infection is one of the common diseases of
livestock (including pigs) particularly in tropical countries
which have tremendous economic impact on livestock pro-
ductions and the paucity of information on the prevalence of
STEC in pigs in India, the present study was undertaken to
determine the prevalence of STEC in healthy and diarrhoeic
pigs as well as to characterize and determine the antimicrobial
resistance of the STEC isolates.

Materials and methods

Sample collection, culture and STEC screening

Rectal swabs were collected in duplicate from clinically
healthy (473) and diarrhoeic (309) piglets (1–8 weeks of
age) during the period from February 2010 to May 2013 from
organized and unorganized pigs farms located in Assam
(251 nos.), Arunachal Pradesh (152 nos.), Meghalaya
(192 nos.) and Nagaland (187 nos.) states of India. Rectal
swabs were collected from each piglet. Samples were collect-
ed directly from the rectum by using individual sterilized
cotton swabs to avoid piglet to piglet cross-contamination.
All the samples were collected in sterile polypropylene con-
tainers, were transported to the laboratory under ice cover and
were processed within 4 h.

For isolation of non-O157 STEC, faecal samples were
plated directly onto MacConkey agar (Hi Media, Mumbai,
India). Following overnight incubation, 10 suspected E. coli
colonies were tested for the genes encoding Stx1 and Stx2
toxins (stx1 and stx2 genes) by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) as previously described (Rey et al. 2003). The resulting

Trop Anim Health Prod

STEC isolates were also confirmed biochemically as per the
method of Cowan and Steel (1993) and tested for the genes
encoding intimin (eae gene), enterohaemolysin (ehxA gene)
and Saa (saa gene) as previously described (Sanchez et al.
2009). When isolates from a given sample exhibited similar
genetic characteristics in terms of the presence or absence of
virulence genes, only one colony was selected and stored until
further characterization. Otherwise, when isolates with differ-
ent genetic characteristics were obtained, one colony of each
was selected and stored for further characterization.

For isolation of O157 STEC, the protocol described by De
Boer and Heuvelink (2000) was followed. Briefly, each of the
rectal swabs was added to 10 ml of modified tryptic soy broth
(TSB containing 20 mg/l novobiocin) for enrichment culture
and incubated for 6–8 h at 37 °C. Enrichment culture in
modified TSB was streaked onto sorbitol MacConkey agar
(SMAC) and SMAC containing 0.05 mg/l of cefixime and
1 mg/l potassium tellurite (CTSMAC). The plates were incu-
bated for 18–24 h at 37 °C. Both sorbitol-fermenting and non-
fermenting colonies were picked (5–10 from each plate) and
identified biochemically. Following overnight incubation,
both sorbitol-fermenting and non-fermenting colonies (5–10
from each plate) were tested for the genes encoding O157 and
H7 antigens (O157 rfbE and fliCh7 genes) by PCR as previ-
ously described (Garcia-Sanchez et al. 2007). The resulting
E. coli O157 isolates were confirmed biochemically as E. coli
and tested for the genes stx1, stx2, eae, ehxA and saa Table 1.

Serotyping

E. coli isolates were serotyped based on their somatic (O)
antigens at National Salmonella and Escherichia Centre,
Central Research Institute, Kasauli, Himachal Pradesh, India.

Antimicrobial susceptibility test

Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by the disk
diffusion method using 16 commercially available antimicro-
bials disks (Table 2) as per the method of the Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines (CLSI 2008).

Results

A total of 782 E. coli (309 from diarrhoeic and 473 from
healthy piglets) were isolated from 782 faecal samples.
Overall STEC strains were detected in 113 (14.4 %) piglets
(19.4 % from diarrhoeic piglets and 11.2 % from healthy
piglets). E. coli O157 was isolated from four (0.5 %) piglets,
and non-O157 STEC was isolated from 109 (13.9 %) piglets.
The STEC isolates were placed into 18 serogroups, and the
most predominant serogroup was O5 (Table 1). Gene
encoding O157 (O157 rfbE) could be detected in all O157

were negative for STEC autoagglutinating adhesin (Saa).
Antimicrobial susceptibility of the STEC isolates is presented
in Table 2. The number of STEC isolates which showed
resistance to antimicrobials such as ampicillin, tetracycline,
streptomycin, lincomycin, nalidixic acid, sulfadiazine,
penicillin, gentamicin, kanamycin and ceftriaxone were
100, 99, 98, 97, 95, 94, 92, 88, 85 and 85, respectively.
The most effective antimicrobials in terms of sensitivity were
chlortetracycline (72.5 %), enrofloxacin (69.9 %), amikacin
(69 %), norfloxacin (68.1 %) and ciprofloxacin (67.2 %).
Antimicrobial resistance patterns of the STEC isolates are
shown in Table 3.

Discussion

In the present study, we recorded the prevalence of STEC
in 14.4 % pigs, and the prevalence of non-O157 STEC and
O157 STEC were 13.9 and 0.5 %, respectively. Several
studies have examined the prevalence of STEC in swine.
STEC were detected in 22 % pigs from Switzerland
(Kaufmann et al. 2006), 30.2 % pigs from Germany (von
Muffling et al. 2007), 4.5 % pigs from Argentina (Moredo
et al. 2012) and 0.4 % pigs from South Africa (Mohlatlole
et al. 2013). The prevalence of E. coli O157 in the present
study was lower than that reported from the USA (Keen
et al. 2006) and Nigeria (Ojo et al. 2010) where it ranged
from 1.2 to 3 %, respectively but higher than that reported
(present in two of 2,446 samples) in Swedish pigs
(Eriksson et al. 2003). There is paucity of information
on prevalence of porcine STEC in India. Barman et al.
(2008) could isolate three STEC strains from an outbreak
of oedema disease in a pig farm in India and all the
isolates were untypeable. Isolation of O157 STEC from
pigs in India was also reported by Sehgal et al. (2008), but
the isolates were not analyzed for their virulence charac-
teristics. The observed differences in the present study
could be due to differences in husbandry practices and
prevailing climatic conditions which may account for the
varied prevalence of STEC from one geographical region
to another. Several studies also showed that the preva-
lence of STEC in animals may vary with the husbandry
practices (such as stocking densities, types of feeds of-
fered etc.) as well as the climatic conditions of the area
under the study (Gautam et al. 2011; Diaz-Sanchez et al.
2013). Diaz-Sanchez et al. (2013) found that the STEC

prevalence in red deer was significantly higher where high
densities of red deer (p<0.001) were present. Gautam et al.
(2011) explored the potential role of ambient temperature on
infection transmission dynamics for E. coli O157:H7 in a dairy
herd, and their studies indicated that seasonal variation in ambi-
ent temperature could have a considerable impact on pathogen
populations in the environment, specifically on barn surfaces
and in water troughs, and consequently on the prevalence of
infection in the host population. It was also observed that
feeding of calves with lower levels of dietary wet distillers grains
(15 % or less) 56 days prior to harvest significantly reduces
E. coli O157:H7 in faeces and on hides (Wells et al. 2011).

Most of the serogroups associated with porcine STEC in
this study have been reported in different animal species
including pigs by various workers from different countries
(Fratamico et al. 2004; Hussein 2007). Vu Khac et al. (2006)
found that porcine pathogenic E. coli involved in post
weaning diarrhoea typically belonged to serogroups O8,
O138, O139, O141, O147, O149 and O157. We have also
recorded the presence of serogroups such as O8, O138, O147
and O157 in the present study thereby indicating that pigs in
India are potential reservoirs’ of pathogenic E. coli.
Interestingly, the serogroups such as O103 and O157 recorded
in the present study have been generally reported to be asso-
ciated with HUS in human being (OIE 2008). Therefore,
isolation of these serogroups from pigs in India warrants
possibility of transmission of this pathogen from pigs to
human being and may pose serious public health problem in
future. Several STEC strains are responsible for human gas-
trointestinal illnesses, from mild diarrhoea to bloody diarrhoea
to haemorrhagic colitis and HUS. Most outbreaks and sporad-
ic cases of bloody diarrhoea and HUS have been attributed to
strains of STEC serotype O157:H7. However, recently in
many countries, the role of non-O157 STEC strains as the
cause of HUS, bloody diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal
illnesses are increasingly being recognized (European Food
Safety Authority 2010).

It was observed that although four of the E. coli O157
isolates carried genes for O157 rfbE, they were negative for

gene encoding for H7 antigen (fliCh7). The present finding is
consistent with the findings of Farzan et al. (2010) who
detected E. coli O157 in 3 % samples from pigs in Canada,
but no E. coli O157:H7 could be recovered from those
samples.

In this study, all O157 E. coli and non-O157 E. coli isolates
had one or both Shiga toxin genes. A greater percentage
(5.1 %) of STEC isolates in this study possessed both stx
genes as against stx1 (4.6 %) and stx2 (3.7 %). Studies on
the prevalence of STEC in pigs from France revealed that all
(48) STEC isolates were non-O157:H7 and positive for stx2
gene (Bouvet et al. 2002). Similarly, while conducting studies
for determining the prevalence of STEC in swine in the USA,
Fratamico et al. (2004) found that out of 687 faecal samples,
70 % (484 of 687) were positive for Shiga toxin genes and
54 % (370 of 687), 64 % (436 of 687) and 38 % (261 of 687)
were positive for stx1, stx2 and both toxin genes, respectively.
It has also been reported that only 8.8 % (283 of 3,218) of
faecal E. coli isolates from piglets with edema disease in
Germany were stx positive (Barth et al. 2007). Ateba and
Bezuidenhout (2008) observed that out of 20 STEC isolates
from pigs, none of the isolates were positive for stx genes, but
the number of isolates positive for genes eae, hlyA and both
eae and hlyA were 7, 18 and 5, respectively. The variations in
the prevalence of these genes as observed in the present study
could be due to geographical variations or differences in age
of the animals as observed by Shaw et al. (2004).

The main virulence factor of STEC contributing to patho-
genicity is the production of Stx1, Stx2 or both, each including
several variants (Growther et al. 2013). Strains producing Stx2
alone or both Stx1 and Stx2 cause more serious illness than
those producing only Stx1 (Jeong et al. 2010). The mode of
toxic action starts with the toxin molecule binding to host cell
receptors, facilitating transfer of the toxin into the cells. Once
inside the host cell, the A-subunit of the toxin, which pos-
sesses enzyme activity, interferes with host cell protein syn-
thesis and induces an inflammatory response (Tesh 2012).

Numerous investigators have underlined the strong associ-
ation between the carriage of eae gene and the capacity of

Trop Anim Health Prod

STEC to cause severe human disease, especially HUS
(Suardana et al. 2011). In the current study, the combination
of eae and stx2 in addition to stx1 was detected in two (0.2 %)
isolates. Therefore, the prevalence of STEC isolates with such
gene combination in pigs in India may pose threat to human
health as porcine STEC isolates frequently share virulence-
associated traits, i.e. genes with human enterohaemorrhagic
E. coli (EHEC) strains (Meng et al. 2014).

The ability to produce one or more Shiga toxins is an
important virulence characteristic of STEC (Growther et al.
2013). However, production of Shiga toxins alone may not be
sufficient for STEC to be pathogenic. Other virulence factors
such as the intimin protein, the presence of a plasmid-encoded
hemolysin or both, are important in the pathophysiology of
hemorrhagic disease (Lorenz et al. 2013). As the isolates
carrying stx, eae and ehxA, stx plus eae and stx plus ehxA
have also been recovered in this study; these isolates can
potentially cause disease and should be considered pathogenic
to humans. In the present study, none of the STEC isolates was
found to carry saa gene which corroborated with the findings
of Sonntag et al. (2005).

The number of STEC isolates in the present study which
showed resistance to antimicrobials such as ampicillin, tetra-
cycline, streptomycin, lincomycin, nalidixic acid, sulfadia-
zine, penicillin, gentamicin, kanamycin and ceftriaxone were
100, 99, 98, 97, 95, 94, 92, 88, 85 and 85, respectively. The
present finding is in agreement with the findings of Choi et al.
(2002) who also observed resistance of E. coli isolates from
diarrhoeic pigs to several antimicrobials and they found that
out of 285 E. coli isolates, the number of isolates resistant to
ampicillin, tetracycline, lincomycin, sulfadiazine, penicillin
and gentamicin were 249, 259, 254, 257, 258 and 191, re-
spectively. Similarly, while evaluating the antimicrobial resis-
tance of STEC isolates from pigs, Ojo et al. (2010) observed
that out of 154 STEC isolates, the number of isolates resistant
to ampicillin, tetracycline and streptomycin were 127, 116 and
78, respectively. In the present study, 97 isolates showed
multidrug resistance where eight resistance groups (R1 to
R8) were observed. Similarly, Ojo et al. (2010) detected
multidrug resistance STEC isolates from pigs in Nigeria
where they observed 38 resistance groups (R1-R38, showing
resistance against more than two antimicrobials), and the
resistance pattern which the maximum number of isolates
(16) exhibited was ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin
and tetracycline followed by ampicillin, chloramphenicol,
ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, nalidixic acid, neomycin,
norfloxacin, streptomycin, and tetracycline (13 isolates). The
findings of the present study also corroborated with the find-
ings of Schroeder et al. (2002) who observed that highest
number of STEC isolates (71 %, n=70) from pigs in compar-
ison to humans (12 %, n=131) and cattle (20 %, n=133) were
resistant to tetracycline, and the corresponding values for
ampicillin were 24, 21 and 3 %, respectively. The emergence

of resistant bacterial strains could be due to common use of
these antimicrobials for the treatment of animal diseases in
India. Antimicrobial resistant strains of STEC may have se-
lective advantage over other bacterial flora of the gastrointes-
tinal tract of animals thereby contributing to their predomi-
nance and persistence in animals to establish a carrier status
(Zhao et al. 2001). An increase in antimicrobial resistance in
zoonotic bacterial isolates from animals, food and humans is a
concern in veterinary and human medicine. The monitoring of
antimicrobial resistance in enteric bacteria especially of ani-
mal origin is important in tracking and controlling the emer-
gence and dissemination of antimicrobial resistant bacterial
strains in human and animal populations.

As the pathogenicity of pathogenic E. coli can be deter-
mined by virulence factor combinations (Döpfer et al. 2012)
and we also observed different combinations of virulence
factors in STEC isolates from pigs in this study, these isolates
may be important potential pathogens of public health signif-
icance. However, further studies should be undertaken to
establish the role of pigs in transmitting this pathogen to
human being.
