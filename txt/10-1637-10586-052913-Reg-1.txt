SUMMARY. This study was undertaken to observe the prevalence, serogroup, avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC)-
associated virulence gene, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) pattern, and antibiotic resistance genes of E. coli in
backyard layers and their environment in India. From the 360 samples of healthy layers and their environment, 272 (75.5%) E. coli
were isolated. The majority (28.67%) of them were untypeable. Among the studied virulence genes (papC, tsh, iucC, astA), 52
(14.32%) isolates were found to possess astA, including the isolates from the drinking water of the birds (4/272, 1.47%). These
strains belonged to 18 different serogroups. Most of the isolates were typeable by RAPD and they produced different patterns.
Phenotypic resistance of the isolates was most frequently observed to erythromycin (95.83%), chloramphenicol (87.52%), and
cotrimoxazole (78.26%). None of the isolates was found to possess extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M)
or quinolone resistance (qnrA) genes by PCR. The present study was the first attempt in India to assess APEC distribution in
backyard poultry production.

aisladas de gallinas de postura de traspatio y de su medio ambiente en la India.

Este estudio se realizo´ para determinar la prevalencia, el serogrupo, los genes asociados a virulencia de Escherichia coli pato´gena
para las aves (APEC), los patrones de ADN polimo´rfico amplificado aleatoriamente (RAPD), y los genes de resistencia a los
antibio´ticos de E. coli en gallinas de traspatio y su ambiente en la India. De las 360 muestras de gallinas sanas y de su ambiente, se
aislaron 272 cepas de E. coli (75.5%). La mayorı´a (28.67%) de ellas no fueron tipificables. Entre los genes de virulencia estudiados
(papC, tsh, iucC, astA), se encontro´ que 52 aislamientos (14.32%) poseı´an el gene astA, incluyendo los aislamientos de agua de
bebida de las aves (4/272, 1.47%). Estas cepas pertenecı´an a 18 serogrupos diferentes. La mayorı´a de los aislamientos fueron
tipificables mediante RAPD y produjeron diferentes patrones. La resistencia fenotı´pica de los aislamientos se observo´ con mayor
frecuencia contra eritromicina (95.83%), cloranfenicol (87.52%), y contra cotrimoxazol (78.26%). Se encontro´ mediante PCR que
ninguno de los aislamientos poseı´a genes de un espectro extendido de beta-lactamasas (blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M), o resistencia
contra quinolonas (qnrA). El presente estudio es el primer intento en la India para evaluar la distribucio´n de E. coli pato´gena para la
produccio´n de aves de traspatio.

Escherichia coli

is present as commensal microflora of

the
intestinal tract of poultry birds and their environment but certain
strains among them, known as avian pathogenic Escherichia coli
(APEC), are able to cause colibacillosis due to possession of specific
virulence factors. Avian colibacillosis is characterized by a diverse
array of lesions. The infection initiates with septicemia which is
followed by either sudden death or localized inflammation in vital
organs causing perihepatitis, airsacculitis, pericarditis, salpingitis,
omphalitis, osteomyelitis, and so forth (14). The disease is
distributed worldwide and has major economic impact, especially

in the broiler industry due to morbidity, lack of uniformity in a
flock, lowered production, increased condemnation at the slaughter
plant, and mortality (1). Currently there is a resurgence of this
infection among layer chickens as observed in Europe (22,43) and
Asia (20), including India (23). The layers kept in backyard farming
also possess multidrug-resistant E. coli as reported in Costa Rica (21)
as well as in India (9).

APEC possesses several virulence factors such as colicin V (cvaC),
increased serum survival gene (iss),
siderophore receptor (iroN),
outer membrane protein (traT), and hemolysin (hlyD) (37). Among
the virulence factors identified four are described as major factors,
such as P fimbriae (papC ), which helps to adhere to chicken internal
organs, temperature-sensitive hemagglutinin (tsh), which plays a role

in colonization of the air sacs, the aerobactin iron sequestering
system (iucC ), and enteroaggregative toxin (astA) (16,41). These
virulence factors (iucC, tsh, papC ) help the pathogen to establish
extraintestinal infection in birds as well as in humans also because
both the APEC and uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) can produce
extraintestinal infection with the help of some common virulence
factors (15,36).

Transmission of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli in the human food
chain from the chicken is a well-recognized phenomenon (19).
Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), produced by E. coli,
result in resistance against later-generated cephalosporins (except
cephamycins and carbapenems) and monobactam. Currently, ESBL-
producing organisms are becoming a major threat for patients in the
hospital and community (17). The major ESBL (blaTEM, blaSHV,
blaCTX-M) and quinolone resistance genes (qnrA), if possessed by
APEC, have the potential to be transferred to humans through the
food chain and may complicate extraintestinal infections such as
urinary tract infections in humans.

The present study was undertaken in West Bengal, a major egg-
producing state in India, where a majority of the production is offered
from the layers kept in a backyard farming system. The objective of
this study was to examine E. coli isolates from backyard layers and
their environment from different agroclimatic zones for the presence
of serogroups, virulence genes associated with APEC capable of
establishing extraintestinal infection in humans, and major antibiotic
resistance genes
to perform randomly amplified
polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-based characterization of the isolates.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

(n 5 360)

Sampling. Three-hundred and sixty samples

for
bacteriologic analysis from the birds kept in backyard systems, their
environment, and eggs were collected from four agroclimatic zones of
West Bengal, India (Terai, Red Laterite, New Alluvial, Coastal) during
July–September 2011. The collection area included Jalpaiguri and
Dinajpur districts (Terai zone, n 5 90), Howrah District (New Alluvial
zone, n 5 90), West Midnapur District (Red Laterite zone, n 5 90),
and South 24 Parganas District (Coastal zone, n 5 90). The average
minimum–maximum temperature and rainfall was 22–31 C and 8 mm
in the Terai zone, 27–34 C and 5 mm in Red Laterite zone, and 26–
33 C and 7 mm in New Alluvial and Coastal zones, respectively, during
the sample collection period. The samples were comprised of cloacal
swabs of the birds (n 5 10), their feed (4 g, n 5 10), drinking water
(10 ml, n 5 10), utensil swabs (n 5 10), litter (4 g, n 5 10), swabs from
the walls of the poultry house (n 5 10), dried manure under the house
(4 g, n 5 10), soil (4 g, n 5 10), and the eggs (n 5 10), which were
collected randomly. The sample size and amount of sample was
determined per earlier reports (25,34). The birds belonged to the Rhode
Island red (RIR) breed and were of all age groups (7 days–3 mo) and
either sex and were apparently healthy. The age of the birds was divided
into three groups; group 1 (1–4 wk), group 2 (5–8 wk), and group 3
(.8 wk). The average flock size maintained by the farmers was 20–25.
The farmers offered boiled rice, raw vegetable waste, and seeds as feed
and locally available water for the birds to drink. In most cases the
drinking water was not regularly changed in the troughs. The birds
generally roamed around the farmer’s house in the daytime and took
shelter in bamboo-made poultry houses at night. The birds were called
for feed and drinking water at a specific time by the women of the farms.
The cloacal samples and swabs from the walls of the poultry houses
and utensils were collected with sterile swabs (HiMedia, Mumbai, India)
whereas, feed, litter, dried manure under the house, and soil samples
were collected in sterile collection vials (HiMedia). The procured eggs
were kept in sterile plastic zipper bags in an icebox with an ice pack. All
the samples were transported to the laboratory in a thermoflask with an
ice pack.

Processing of samples for bacteriologic analysis. All the swabs
(cloacal and utensil) were directly inoculated into nutrient broth
(HiMedia) for bacterial growth. The feed, litter, dried manure, and soil
samples were also directly inoculated into nutrient broth at 4 g of sample
in 36 ml of broth. The drinking water samples were inoculated into
nutrient broth at 5 ml of sample in 45 ml of broth. The egg yolks and
white portions were aseptically taken and were homogenized and mixed
with 200 ml of buffered peptone water and incubated at 37 C (32).

Isolation of E. coli from collected samples. The growth in nutrient
broth was transferred to MacConkey’s agar (HiMedia) and again
incubated at 37 C overnight. The next day, 2–3 rose-pink colonies were
randomly picked and transferred to eosin methylene blue (EMB) agar
(HiMedia) followed by an overnight incubation at 37 C. The colonies
were observed for metallic sheen and a single colony was streaked into a
nutrient agar slant
for further biochemical confirmation. All pure
cultures obtained from the nutrient agar slant were subjected to Gram
staining and standard biochemical tests as described earlier (45). The
strains were stored in glycerol broth at 270 C for
subsequent
characterization.

Serogrouping. All

the E.
tests, were sent

coli
isolates, after confirmation by
biochemical
for O-serogrouping to the National
Salmonella and Escherichia Center, Central Research Institute, Kasuli,
Himachal Pradesh, India.

Bacterial DNA extraction. For PCR-based detection of APEC
virulence and major ESBL or qnrA genes from all the E. coli isolates,
DNA was extracted as per the previously described method (44).

PCR-based detection of characteristic APEC virulence genes. The
virulence genes for APEC (papC, tsh, astA, iucC) isolates were confirmed
by PCR using the primer sequences and cycle condition of earlier works
(16,41). All the reagents were procured from Genetix Biotechnology
Asia Pvt. Ltd. (New Delhi, India). The amplification was conducted in a
thermocycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The amplified product
was visualized by a gel documentation system (UVP, Cambridge, United
Kingdom) after electrophoresis in 2% (w/v) agarose gel containing
ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/ml; SRL Laboratories, Mumbai, India) (38).
the
virulence genes. The selected PCR products were sequenced on both
strands in an ABI 3730 XL automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). The sequence homology searches were conducted
using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool algorithm (www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/BLAST).

Nucleotide sequencing of

Molecular characterization of E. coli isolates by RAPD-PCR. The
molecular characterization of all the E. coli isolates was done by RAPD-
PCR using a single primer 6 (Genetix Biotechnology Asia Pvt. Ltd.) in a
thermocycler (Eppendorf) per the protocol of Chansiripornchai et al.
(6). The PCR products were then electrophoresed in 2% (w/v) agarose
gel containing ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/ml) (38).

Antibiotic resistance of E. coli isolates. All the PCR-confirmed astA
genes possessing E. coli isolates were tested for their sensitivity and
resistance to different antibiotics by the disc diffusion method. The
minimum inhibitory concentration breakpoints were used to interpret
the zone diameter for each antibiotic as mentioned in Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines (8). The antibiotic
discs used were ampicillin (10 mg), amikacin (30 mg), cefotaxime (30 mg),
cephalexin (30 mg), ceftriaxone (30 mg), ceftizoxime (30 mg), cephalothin
(30 mg), cephaloridine (10 mg), ciprofloxacin (5 mg), chloramphenicol
(30 mg), cotrimoxazole (25 mg), erythromycin (15 mg), gentamicin
(10 mg), kanamycin (30 mg), levofloxacin (5 mg), neomycin (30 mg),
norfloxacin (10 mg), streptomycin (10 mg), and tetracycline (30 mg). All
were obtained from HiMedia. The discs with CLSI-recommended
antibiotic concentration were used. However, if not available, the discs
(e.g., cotrimoxazole, cephalexin) with the concentration offered by the
manufacturer were used.

PCR-based detection of major ESBL (blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M)
and quinolone resistance genes (qnrA). All
isolates,
including controls, were subjected to PCR for detection of blaTEM,
blaSHV, blaCTX-M, and qnrA genes using the primers and the cycle
conditions described earlier (4,46,47).

Statistical analysis. Univariate analysis of variance for detection of
significant differences between isolate numbers of E. coli, with the age
group of the birds and their agroclimatic zone, was performed in SPSS
version 21 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Further, the association of the
antibiotic resistance among the E. coli isolates, with the source of
isolation, serogroups, and RAPD pattern, was also calculated by a chi-
square test using SPSS version 21 (SPSS Inc.).

RESULTS

Isolation of E. coli from collected samples. From the 360
cloacal swabs of apparently healthy layers, and their environmental
samples (feed, drinking water, litter, soil) examined, a total of 272
isolates (75.5%, Table 1) were identified as E. coli on the basis of
characteristic pink-colored colonies on MacConkey agar, a metallic
sheen in EMB agar, and the gram-negative small rod appearance in
stained smears; biochemically they were catalase (+ve), oxidase
indole (+ve), methyl-red (+ve), Voges-Proskauer (2ve),
(2ve),
citrate (2ve), and urease (2ve), characteristic of the standard E. coli
strain. All the E. coli were isolated from birds of the lower age group
(1–4 wk, age group 1). A statistically significant difference was
observed in the number of E. coli isolates between age group 1 (1–
4 wk) and age group 2 (4–8 wk) at P , 0.01 and between age group
1 (1–4 wk) and age group 3 (.8 wk) at P , 0.01. The highest E.
coli isolation rate in birds (cloacal swab) was observed in the Terai
zone (20/272; 7.3%) followed by Red Laterite (13/272; 4.7%),
Coastal (12/272; 4.4%), and the New Alluvial zone (10/272; 3.6%),
which was statistically significant at P , 0.05. No E. coli were
isolated from environmental samples (except feed, drinking water,
litter, and soil) or egg samples collected (Table 1).

Serogrouping. Among the 272 E.

isolates, 78 strains
(28.67%) were untypeable (UT) and the remaining isolates (194)
were distributed among 47 different O-serogroups. The serogroups
isolated from the birds with higher frequency were UT, O84, O147,
and O60 whereas the serogroups isolated from the feed, drinking
water, litter, and soil were UT, O106, O123, and O170, respectively.
The APEC serogroups such as O1, O2, O8, O22, and O78 were also
isolated from the studied clinically healthy birds kept in all of the four
agroclimatic zones. Among them, O8 was isolated with the highest
frequency (16/272, 5.88%) from the birds, especially from those kept
in the Terai zone.

O101, O106, O123, O138, O143, O147, O170, O172) whereas 16
and 4 strains were UT and rough, respectively (Table 2).

RAPD analysis of E. coli isolates. All 272 E. coli strains were
characterized by RAPD-PCR to determine the genetic diversity
among the strains. The majority of the strains (n 5 212) were
typeable with primer 6 and they produced 20 different patterns.
However, no zone- or
serogroup-related specific pattern was
observed whereas all the astA gene-possessing E. coli produced four
(A, B, C, D) distinct patterns which were correlated statistically with
antibiotic resistance (Table 2).

Antibiotic resistance of E. coli isolates. Resistance of E. coli
isolates was observed most frequently to erythromycin (95.83%),
chloramphenicol (87.52%), cotrimoxazole (78.26%), gentamicin
(65.23%), and tetracycline (42.76%). No resistance was observed
against cefotaxime, cephalexin, ceftriaxone, ceftizoxime, cephalothin,
cephaloridine, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. However, intermedi-
ate reaction was observed against ampicillin, amikacin, neomycin,
norfloxacin, and streptomycin. Further, none of the isolates was
found to possess ESBL (blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M) or quinolone
resistance genes (qnrA) in PCR.

isolates,

A statistically significant correlation was detected between the
antibiotic resistance, the RAPD pattern (of astA gene-possessing E.
coli), and the zone of isolation of E. coli (Table 2). Due to a limited
number of categorical
it was not possible to draw any
conclusion with respect to serogroups. The tetracycline resistance
was more likely to occur among the E. coli isolates with RAPD
pattern A (58%) than with the isolates possessing other patterns.
Similarly, gentamicin resistance was more frequently associated with
isolates with pattern B (55.5%). However, for both tetracycline (P 5
0.06) and gentamicin (P 5 0.058) the difference is marginally
the resistance against cotrimoxazole,
significant. Furthermore,
erythromycin, gentamicin, and tetracycline among the E.
coli
found to have a statistical correlation with the
isolates was
agroclimatic zone of isolation. The Terai zone was significantly
more frequently associated with the resistance against gentamicin (P
5 0.001), tetracycline (P 5 0.007), and cotrimoxazole (P 5 0.04)
whereas the New Alluvial zone was significantly more frequently
associated with tetracycline (P 5 0.007) and cotrimoxazole (P 5
0.04). However, the erythromycin resistance was significantly (P 5
0.003) higher when observed in isolates from the entire four zones.

Detection of characteristic APEC virulence genes in E. coli
isolates. Escherichia coli harboring a single APEC virulence gene
(astA) was detected in 52 (14.32%) of the 272 E. coli isolates. The
sequence of the selected PCR product (astA) was found to be
in consensus (98%) with the astA gene of E. coli isolated from a
different
(GenBank accession numbers HM099899,
HM099895, M099894). Other studied virulence genes (papC, tsh,
iucC) were not detected in any of the E. coli isolates. The present
study also detected the astA gene in E. coli isolates (4/272, 1.47%)
from the drinking water of birds in the Coastal zone. The E. coli
strains harboring the astA gene only belonged to 18 different
serogroups (O2, O8, O10, O55, O74, O76, O78, O84, O90, O91,

DISCUSSION

APEC is found to be responsible for avian collibacillosis, an
extraintestinal syndrome commonly encountered in broiler birds and
which has a major economic impact worldwide. Currently layers in
different parts of the world, including India, are also affected with
APEC. However, systematic molecular epidemiologic study on
APEC infection in layer birds kept in a backyard system is scarce.
Earlier we reported the occurrence of multidrug-resistant E. coli in
backyard layer birds in West Bengal, India (9). The present study
was aimed to detect the serogroups, APEC-associated virulence genes

capable of establishing extraintestinal infection in humans, antibiotic

backyard layers and from their environment in different agroclimatic
zones (Terai, New Alluvial, Red Laterite, and Coastal) of West
Bengal, India.

coli was

The present study detected a high prevalence (75%) of E. coli in
healthy backyard layers and from their environment within four
agroclimatic zones. Our previous study also detected 71 out of 85
cloacal swabs (85.5%) from healthy backyard layers (RIR breed)
were positive for E. coli in West Bengal, India (9). Similarly, in
Bangladesh, E.
swabs of
apparently healthy layers (24). In other countries, such as the
United Kingdom, 16 E. coli isolates were obtained from three
healthy layers and nine isolates were obtained from their feed,
drinking water, and litter (41). In Australia, 59 E. coli isolates
(85.5%) were isolated from 69 free-range egg-layer chickens (31). In
India, an earlier report found 12.5% of litter samples from farmed
broiler birds were positive for E. coli (12).

isolated from 83% cloacal

In the four studied agroclimatic zones, isolation of E. coli from the
cloacal swabs was found to be correlated with the lower age group
(1–4 wk) of birds (P , 0.01). The predominant bacteria in the
chicken ceca was E. coli in broilers up to 2 wk of age, as detected by
denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (40). The highest E. coli
isolation rate in birds (cloacal swabs) in the Terai zone, which
differed significantly from other zones (P , 0.05), can be explained
by the fact that the humid weather due to high rainfall with cyclic

periods of wet and dry weather is conducive to E. coli growth; this
was observed in the Terai zone during the sample collection period
(11).

The majority of the E. coli isolates belonged to untypeable
serogroups. Most of the serogroups of E. coli were observed as UT
when isolated from the healthy layers in Brazil and Belgium
(13,43). The serogroups isolated from healthy poultry included
O2, O78, O106, rough, and UT in the United States; these were
also detected in our present study (37). The serogroups O84 and
O147 were also isolated from a maximum number of backyard
layers in West Bengal, as reported in our previous study (9).
Classical APEC serogroups
such as O2 and O78 were also
previously isolated from clinically healthy layer hens in Italy (3).
The high frequency of detection of serogroup O8 in the Terai zone
was probably due to the presence of commercial broiler farms in
the vicinity that were not situated near the sample collection area
of other agroclimatic zones.

We could not detect the major APEC virulence genes (papC, tsh,
iucC) in any of the E. coli isolates. Similarly, papC was not detected
in any of the 59 E. coli isolates from free-range healthy layers in
Australia (31). On the other hand, in healthy commercial broilers
papC (6%) and tsh (4%) were detected at a very low frequency in
comparison to the broilers with colisepticemia in Brazil (18.5% and
39.5%, respectively) (10). However, in contrast, the presence of the
tsh (93%) and pap (15%) gene with higher frequency was detected in
healthy commercial broilers in Ireland (29). Our finding of the astA

gene in the isolates was in corroboration with other works such as
Circella et al. (7) and Randall et al. (35), who also found the astA
gene possessing APEC from the intestinal tract of healthy turkey and
commercial broilers in Italy and the United Kingdom. In contrast,
20% of the APEC strains isolated from broilers with colisepticemia
were also detected to possess the astA gene in Germany (16). It seems
that astA is associated with an APEC virulotype from both healthy
and diseased birds. In healthy birds it has pathogenic potential
because it was confirmed earlier that each virulence factor alone can
induce avian colibacillosis (39). It can be speculated that the low
prevalence of infection among backyard chickens is, in most cases,
lower than in commercial breeds and hybrids because of fewer
associations of the pathogens with the required virulence genes to
establish an infection (30); this could explain the absence of the
major virulence genes in the present study. More related studies are
required to establish the fact firmly. Further, absence of the major
virulence genes (papC, tsh, iucC) in E. coli isolated from the studied
backyard layers also affirmed that this kind of bird does not act as a
food vehicle to spread UPEC in humans, as the same genes are
shared by both of them, and the oral route may have the potential
to spread the uropathogenic infection. Specifically, the plasmid
(pTJ100) carrying the tsh and iucC in E. coli is transmissible to other
E.
related bacteria and supports establishment of an
extraintestinal infection (36).

coli or

We have also detected E. coli possessing the astA gene in drinking
water of birds kept in the Coastal zone. In this zone, water collected
from the local ponds in the vicinity was used for drinking by the
birds. The ponds were otherwise used for bathing and washing after
defecation by the villagers, possibly making them a source of E. coli
that possess the astA gene, a common cause of watery diarrhea in
humans in India (2). In other studied agroclimatic zones, ground
water used for the birds to drink was free of fecal contamination.

Our

study detected 18 different

serogroups of astA gene-
possessing E. coli. Similar types of studies regarding the virulence
gene profile of E. coli serogroups isolated from backyard layer birds
were apparently not available to compare with the present finding.
However, in contrast, O2 and O78 isolated from healthy farmed
broiler birds were found to possess the tsh gene in Italy (3). The
difference in virulence gene patterns of E. coli isolates from the birds
was probably due to differences in geographic location, breed, and
the farming systems for the birds.

The RAPD analysis could not find any serogroup or agroclimatic
zone–specific pattern. This is in support of the observations by
Kru¨ger et al. (26) and Mahanti et al. (28), where they found many
RAPD patterns among the non-O157 E. coli isolates belonging to
the same serotypes or locality.

study, higher

In corroboration with our

resistance against
chloramphenicol and cotrimoxazole and zero resistance against
ciprofloxacin were observed in E. coli
isolated from free-range
chickens in Nigeria (33). The majority of E. coli isolated from
backyard layers in West Bengal in our previous study also showed
sensitivity to ciprofloxacin (9). In contrast, in Australia E. coli isolated
from free-range layers was found highly resistant against tetracycline
and with zero resistance against cotrimoxazole (31). Intermediate
sensitivity was observed against ampicillin, neomycin, and norfloxa-
cin, as detected earlier in APEC isolates from Thailand (5).

The antibiotic resistance profile was statistically correlated with
the agroclimatic zone of E. coli
isolation. Probably the use of
erythromycin in all of the four zones, and the use of gentamicin,
tetracycline, and cotrimoxazole in the Terai and New Alluvial zones
in the backyard flock owners for their own medicine or in their
agricultural practices (especially tetracycline) was significantly high

correlation between the

enough to transfer the resistance among the isolates. A similar kind
of
specifically
spreading liquid manure in agricultural lands nearby beaches, was
linked to the contamination of the beach waters by antimicrobial-
resistant E. coli in Canada (42).

agricultural practices,

The present study did not detect ESBL-associated genes (blaTEM,
blaSHV, blaCTX-M) or quinolone resistance genes (qnrA) in any of the
isolates tested. Similarly, blaSHV was not observed in any of the E.
coli isolates from studied free-range layers in Australia, although
blaTEM was detected at a low frequency (3/59, 5.08%), probably due
to transfer from a breeder flock (31). No other study regarding the
antibiotic resistance gene profile of E. coli isolated from backyard
layers was apparently available for further comparison with the
present finding. The antibiotic resistance profile is largely dependent
on the usage of the antibiotics in the birds or their environment (18).
The finding of no resistance genes in backyard layers in the present
study could be explained by the very limited use of antibiotics of
this class in these types of birds. Phenotypic resistance against
chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin, and tetracycline, as
observed, was probably acquired from humans, from the environ-
ment due to agricultural uses, and from commercial broilers which
had received similar kind of antibiotics for their treatment due to
sharing of the common atmosphere (27).

Escherichia coli isolated from the backyard layers kept in different
agroclimatic zones of West Bengal, India did not possess the major
studied virulence genes of APEC (papC, tsh, iucC) required to
establish infection in the birds, as well as in humans, due to
similarity in the virulence factors between APEC and extraintestinal
E. coli such as UPEC. Further, absence of ESBL and quinolone
resistance genes makes the birds and their product a safe food for
human consumption in comparison to commercially farmed birds.
