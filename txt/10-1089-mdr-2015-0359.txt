Salmonella is one of the leading causes for foodborne diseases. Foods, particularly those of animal origin, act as an
important role for Salmonella transmission. In this study, the antibiotic susceptibility of 743 Salmonella isolates
recovered from retail raw chicken carcasses in eight provinces was tested, and the isolates were also screened for the
presence of class I integron and drug-resistant gene cassettes. One hundred thirteen (15.21%) isolates were harboring
class I integron. A higher percentage of integron-positive Salmonella isolates were found in retail chicken in Sichuan
Province (29.33%), followed by Beijing (22.14%), Shaanxi (19.15%), Guangxi (14.13%), Henan (12.50%),
Shanghai (7.25%), Fujian (8.22%), and Guangdong (6.25%) Provinces. The respective prevalence of class I integron
in Salmonella isolates recovered from retail chickens in large, free, and small markets was 16.31%, 14.04%, and
15.27%. Moreover, 20.13%, 14.02%, and 13.74% of Salmonella isolates recovered from retail chickens stored in
frozen, chilled, and ambient conditions, respectively, were positive for class I integron. Subsequent sequencing of
class I integron revealed the presence of 10 gene cassettes harboring resistance genes (dfrA17-aadA5, dfrA17-
aadA5, dfrA1-aadA1, dfrA12-aadA2, dfrA17-aadA5-aadA4, dfrA1-aadA1-aadA2, dfrA1, dfrA5, aadA2,
aacA4-catB8-aadA1-dfrA1-(aac6-II)-(blaCARB-8), blaPSE-1-blaP1). The most prevalent gene cassette was dfrA17-
aadA5 (59.62%). Class I integron-positive isolates were signiﬁcantly more resistant to multiple antibiotics, and they
commonly exhibited corresponding antibiotic resistance proﬁles to the antibiotic resistance gene cassettes harbored
in their class I integron. The results indicated that class I integron with different antibiotic resistance gene cassettes
that were prevalent in Salmonella isolates differed from provinces, marketplaces, and chicken storage conditions.

Introduction

S almonella is a notorious pathogen associated with

foodborne outbreaks worldwide.1 Salmonella infections
were reported as the second leading cause of bacterial
foodborne illness in the United States2 and were responsible
for *1.2 million patients annually, resulting in estimated
medical costs of $365 million.3 In the European Union,
salmonellosis was the second most commonly reported
gastrointestinal infection, with a conﬁrmed case rate of 20.4
cases per 100,000 individuals in 2011.4 In China, 22.2%
of foodborne diseases were caused by Salmonella spp.,5
and salmonellosis was ranked as the fourth most preva-
lent foodborne disease caused by microbial agents.6

Among various foods, poultry and poultry products (meat
and eggs) had been recognized as the most signiﬁcant vehicle

for human salmonellosis,7 and several foodborne Salmonella
outbreaks were caused by contaminated poultry products.8,9
Antibiotics would remain the most effective treatment for
invasive, life-threatening salmonellosis infection for a long
time in the future.10 However, ubiquitous usage of antibiotics
not only facilitated the emergence of antibiotic resistance but
also created signiﬁcant challenges to animal husbandry.10,11
Several previous foodborne outbreaks indicated that
the
multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella was of increasing
concern.12–15

Integrons are mobile DNA elements comprising a site-
speciﬁc recombination system that is capable of integrating
and expressing antibiotic resistance genes in cassette-like
structures and transferring resistant genes from one bacterium
to another, which in turn lead to the emergence of antibiotic
resistance.15,16 Among various integrons, class I integron

was the most predominant one and played a major role in
multidrug resistance development of Salmonella.17–20

Several previous studies indicated that class I integrons
could be detected in MDR Salmonella from animals, eggs,
poultry, human, pork, retail beef, and chicken carcasses in
Japan, the United States, Iran, Ethiopia, Taiwan, Brazil, and
China.8,12,16,17,19–22 However,
information regarding the
distribution of antimicrobial resistance-associated integron
in Salmonella among retail foods is still not well docu-
mented. In this study, the prevalence of class I integron and
antibiotic resistance-associated gene cassettes in Salmonella
isolates were determined for better understanding class I
integron distribution in Salmonella isolates recovered from
retail chicken carcasses in China.

Materials and Methods

Salmonella isolates

Seven hundred forty-three Salmonella isolates (73 iso-
lates were from Fujian, 75 from Sichuan, 88 from Henan, 92
from Guangxi, 94 from Shaanxi, 112 from Guangdong
Province, 69 from Shanghai, and 140 from Beijing) were
included in this study. These isolates were recovered from
retail raw chicken carcasses collected from different mar-
ketplaces in six provinces and two national cities in China
during 2010 and 2011. Detailed information on sample
collection, Salmonella isolation, and identiﬁcation were as
previously described.23,24

Antimicrobial susceptibility test

All Salmonella isolates were tested for their susceptibility
to antimicrobials. The minimum inhibitory concentrations
(MICs) of the antimicrobial agents were determined by the
agar dilution method using Mueller–Hinton agar (Beijing
Land Bridge Technology Co Ltd., Beijing, China) according
to the guidelines recommended by the Clinical and Labora-
tory Standards Institute (CLSI).25 The antibiotics include
ampicillin (AMP), amoxicillin–clavulanic acid (AMC), cef-
tiofur (TIO), ceftriaxone (CRO), cefoxitin (FOX), gentamicin
(GEN), kanamycin (KAN), amikacin (AMK), streptomycin
(STR), tetracyclines (TCY), sulﬁsoxazole (FIS), trimethoprim–
sulfamethoxazole (SXT), chloramphenicol (CHL), nalidixic
acid (NAL), and ciproﬂoxacin (CIP). Escherichia coli
ATCC25922 and ATCC35218, Enterococcus faecalis
ATCC29212 were used as quality control organisms in MIC
determination. The breakpoints for the antibiotics were as
the interpretive standards provided by CLSI,25 except for
streptomycin, for which we used provisional breakpoint
used by the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring
System (NARMS).26

Molecular detection of class I integron

All Salmonella isolates were screened for the presence of
class I integron by PCR using the primers of intI-F-(5¢CS)-
5¢-GGCATCCAAGCAGCAAG-3¢
intI-R-(3¢CS)-5¢-
AAGCAGACTTGACCTGA-3¢.27,28 The PCRs were carried
out in a Mycircle PCR system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) in a
25 ml PCR mixture that contained 0.5 mM of each primer,
1 · PCR buffer, 250 mM of dNTP, 0.5 U of Taq DNA poly-
merase (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 5 ml
of sample template DNA. The PCR conditions were at

and

94°C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 min,
56°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1 min, and a ﬁnal extension of
72°C for 10 min.

DNA sequencing and resistance
gene cassette analysis

PCR products were puriﬁed using the TaKaRa Agarose
Gel DNA Puriﬁcation Kit (Version 2.0; TaKaRa),
then
stored in an ice box, and sent for sequencing at Shanghai
Sunny Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). DNA
sequence data were analyzed and aligned using BLAST
program (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/).

Statistical analysis

The prevalence data of class I integron in Salmonella
isolates were subjected to DPS software (version 9.5, In-
stitute of Insect Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou,
People’s Republic of China) to determine the signiﬁcant
variation. Signiﬁcant ( p < 0.05) difference of the prevalence
of class I integron in Salmonella isolates in different prov-
inces and cities, different retail chicken storage conditions,
and different marketplaces was determined using the Pear-
son’s chi-squared test at the 5% level (a = 0.05).

Results

Among 743 Salmonella isolates, a higher percentage of
the isolates (77.12%) were resistant to tetracycline, followed
by sulﬁsoxazole (66.62%), nalidixic acid (64.74%), ampi-
cillin (61.37%), trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (56.53%),
and amoxicillin–clavulanic acid (48.45%) (Table 1). One
hundred thirteen (15.2%) of the total isolates were harboring
class I integron of 2 kb. Salmonella isolates harboring class I
integron presented a signiﬁcantly ( p < 0.05) higher resistance
to tetracycline, ampicillin, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole,
amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, chloramphenicol, kanamycin,
gentamicin, ceftiofur, cefoxitin, and amikacin compared
with the average resistance rates (Table 1).

Table 2 clariﬁed that in all 113 class I integron-positive
isolates, 5 (4.42%), 23 (20.35%), 37 (32.74%), 37 (32.74%),
and 8 (7.08%) isolates showed resistance to 0, 2–5, 6–9,
10–13, and 14–17 tested antibiotics, respectively. Class I
integron-positive isolates presented signiﬁcantly ( p < 0.05)
more resistance to multiple antibiotics compared with the
average rates of Salmonella.

The results clariﬁed a higher prevalence rate (29.33%)
of class I integron-positive Salmonella isolates recovered
from retail chicken carcasses in Sichuan Province and this
rate was signiﬁcantly higher ( p < 0.05) than those in Guangxi
(14.13%), Henan (12.50%), Fujian (8.22%), Shanghai (7.25%),
and Guangdong (6.25%) Provinces. Moreover, there was
no signiﬁcant difference ( p > 0.05) in the detection rates of
class I integron-positive isolates in Sichuan (29.33%), Beijing
(22.14%), and Shaanxi (19.15%) Provinces. Collectively, our
results showed a signiﬁcantly ( p < 0.05) higher prevalence
rate (20.65%) of class I integron-positive Salmonella iso-
lates in the Northern Provinces of China (Henan, Shaanxi,
Sichuan, and Beijing) compared to (8.96%) the Southern ones
(Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Shanghai).

No signiﬁcant difference was found among the prevalence
rates of Class I integron in Salmonella isolates recovered

the contrary, class I integron was found in Salmonella re-
covered from chicken carcasses stored at chilled conditions in
the Sichuan Province (2.38%) and 3.79% in chickens stored
at ambient temperature in the Beijing Province.

Regarding the distribution of class I integron in Salmo-
nella spp. isolated from chickens at different marketplaces,
Table 3 clariﬁed that 16.31%, 15.27%, and 14.04% of the
total isolates recovered from chickens at large, free, and
small markets, respectively, were harboring class I integron.
In addition, in Salmonella strains isolated from chickens
of large markets, class I integron was more prevalent in
Shaanxi Province (3.86%) than in other Provinces. Mean-
while, for small markets and free markets,
the highest
prevalence rates of class I integron were both detected in
Beijing, with a ratio of 5.96% and 4.03%, respectively.
Moreover, there was no signiﬁcant difference ( p > 0.05) in
the detection rates of class I integron-positive isolates be-
tween capital cities and noncapital cities (Table 3).

Among the 113 class I integron-positive Salmonella iso-
lates, nine (7.96%) were carrying no antibiotic-resistant
gene cassettes (Table 4). Approximately 8.85% of class I
integron carried one antibiotic resistance gene, and 83.19% of

class I integron simultaneously carried two or more resistance
genes. In addition, 10 different gene cassettes containing 14
resistance genes were identiﬁed in 104 (92.04%) of Salmonella
isolates. The cassettes included dfrA17-aadA5, dfrA1-aadA1,
blaPSE-1-blaP1, dfrA1, aadA2, dfrA5, dfrA12-aadA2, aacA4-
catB8-aadA1-dfrA1-(aac6-II)-(blaCARB-8), dfrA1-aadA1-aadA2,
and dfrA17-aadA5-aadA4, respectively (Table 4). The most
prevalent resistance gene cassette was dfrA17-aadA5 (54.87%),
followed by dfrA1-aadA1 (21.24%) and dfrA1 (6.19%).

The results clariﬁed that among class I integron-positive
Salmonella isolates with dfr genes (dfrA1, dfrA5, dfrA12,
and dfrA17), the predominant antimicrobial resistance pro-
ﬁle was FIS-SXT (65.22%). Meanwhile, 31.40% of isolates
harboring aad genes (aadA1, aadA2, aadA5, and aadA4)
presented the proﬁle of GEN-KAN-AMK. Among 11 class
I integron-positive Salmonella isolates presenting antibi-
otic resistance proﬁle of GEN-KAN-AMK-STR, at least one
of the aad genes could be detected. Meanwhile, two class I
integron-positive Salmonella isolates carrying blaPSE-1-blaP1
genes were resistant to ceftiofur and ceftriaxone.

Discussion

Salmonella is a major cause of foodborne illness world-
wide. The increasing frequency of antibiotic resistance
among Salmonella has become an emerging challenge to
public health.29 In the present study, 89.10% of Salmonella
isolates were resistant to two or more antimicrobial agents.
These results were similar to those of other investigators.30–32
Our study indicated that Salmonella isolates were most
frequently resistant to tetracycline (77.12%), sulﬁsoxazole
(66.62%), and nalidixic acid (64.74%), and this was con-
sistent with the ﬁndings of other studies.33,34 This study
presented that 92.92% of the class I integron-positive iso-
lates were resistant to at least two antibiotics, and this ex-
hibited a good evidence for the relationship between the
presence of class I integron and the emerging of MDR in
gram-negative bacteria.12,29

Integron, a mobile DNA element, is known to contain one
or more linked antimicrobial resistance genes and can
transfer these genes among bacteria.35,36 In this study, PCR

analysis showed that 113 (15.21%) of 743 Salmonella iso-
lates were carrying class I integron. In one of our previous
studies, it was found that 16.0% of the Salmonella strains
isolated from retail foods carried class I integron in Shaanxi
province during the period 2007–2008.37 Other previous
surveys in China identiﬁed class I integron in Salmonella
isolates recovered from retail foods, human, and animal
sources with percentages that
ranged from 11.0% to
66.0%.21,22,38,39 Compared with these surveys, we were the
ﬁrst to investigate class I integron in Salmonella isolates in
retail raw chickens by such large sample size and basis.

In the present study, there was a variation in the preva-
lence of class I integron in Salmonella isolates recovered
from retail chickens of different provinces, national cities,
storage conditions, and marketplaces. This variation could
be attributed to the difference in the growth and slaughter
environment of chickens.38 In addition, medical qualities
had certain varieties, which led to the difference of class I
integron and resistance genes.40 Chicken carcasses were
often stored in the markets as fresh at ambient, or as
packaged chilled products, or in frozen conditions. The
difference in temperature, in which chickens were stored,
might have inﬂuenced the number and types of Salmonella,
and consequently affected the popularity of class I integron.
In our study, class I integron was most frequently prevalent
in Salmonella recovered from chicken carcasses that were
stored in frozen conditions (20.13%) compared to 13.74% in
chickens stored at ambient
temperature. The previous
studies had shown that Salmonella contamination in the raw
chickens was related to temperature,41 and our results in-
the survived Salmonella isolates in frozen
dicated that
chicken carcass were more resistant and likely to be class I
integron positive.

The former studies have indicated the existence of certain
relationship between integrons and multidrug resistance of
Salmonella strains, and provided certain signiﬁcant guide-
lines for drug resistance prevention and control.20,29 How-
ever, it was interesting that no resistance gene was detected
in the variable region of class I integron in the two MDR
isolates in this study. As it was known, antibiotic resistance
associated with many factors, including antimicrobial agents
binding target mutations, increased permeability of mem-
brane of the pathogens, and antibiotic degradation through
enzymes encoded by some resistant genes that were com-
monly carried by some transferable DNA elements,
in-
cluding conjugative plasmids, integrons, transposons, and
phages.9,18,21,35,42 Since any transferable element other than
class I integron could play an important role for antimi-
crobial resistance gene carriage and dissemination as well,
the resistance of the two isolates might be caused by other
mechanisms instead of class I integron.16,27,30

Our results indicated that the isolates harboring class I
integron were more resistant to the antibiotics. The dfr, aad,
and bla genes have always contributed to the resistance to
sulfonamide, aminoglycoside, and cephalosporin antibiotics,
respectively. In this study, 91.3% of the 92 isolates carrying
dfr genes (dfrA1, dfrA5, dfrA12, and dfrA17) showed resis-
tance to sulfonamides. The resistance to aminoglycoside an-
tibiotics was identiﬁed in 51 of the 86 isolates carrying aad
genes (aadA1, aadA2, aadA5, and aadA4). In addition, two
of the class I integron-positive isolates carrying blaPSE-1-blaP1
genes were resistant to ceftiofur and ceftriaxone. Various

antibiotic resistance gene cassettes, including dfrA17-aadA5,
dfrA1-aadA1, blaPSE-1-blaP1, dfrA1, aadA2, dfrA5, dfrA12-
aadA2, aacA4-catB8-aadA1-dfrA1-(aac6-II)-(blaCARB-8),
dfrA1-aadA1-aadA2, and dfrA17-aadA5-aadA4, were found
in integron, and Salmonella isolates with these gene cassettes
in their class I integron generally exhibited corresponding
antibiotic resistance proﬁles. The results inferred that the
gene cassettes in the class I integron might be the major cause
of antibiotic resistance in those Salmonella. In class I in-
tegron, antibiotic resistance gene cassettes were normally
found integrated at a speciﬁc location, and enzymes encoded
by the integron could make the gene cassettes transfer from
one bacteria to another, or from one strain to other strains.42–44
The presence of class I integron in Salmonella isolates is of
great potential hazard to the health and food safety of humans
and animals.

In summary, class I integron was ubiquitous in Salmo-
nella isolates recovered from retail raw chicken carcasses
and varied in different marketplaces and chicken storage
conditions at different districts of China. Salmonella isolates
harboring class I integron showed more resistance to the
antibiotics than those without it. Two or more antibiotic
resistance gene cassettes were prevalent in class I integron.
