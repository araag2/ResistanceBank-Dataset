Objectives: The animal reservoir of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) and b-lactamases is still
controversial and little information is available on the prevalence of these resistance determinants in develop-
ing countries. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize PMQR and b-lactamases in a collection of
commensal ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli isolated from healthy chickens and pigs at slaughter, collected
in November–December 2006, in Ibadan, Nigeria.

Methods: One hundred and sixty-two ampicillin-resistant E. coli were obtained from healthy chickens and pigs
at slaughter in Ibadan, Nigeria. Strains were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by disc diffusion assay. MICs
of ciproﬂoxacin were determined by Etest. Resistance genes were screened by PCR and DNA sequencing. Clonal
relatedness of the isolates was determined by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus–PCR. Plasmids
were transferred by conjugation and transformation and characterized by PCR-based replicon typing and
plasmid multilocus sequence typing.

Results: PMQR genes were detected in 18 E. coli strains; 11 of them showed reduced susceptibility to ciproﬂox-
acin. Twelve strains carried qnrS1, three strains carried qnrB19, one strain carried qnrB10 and three strains
carried qepA; one strain carried both qepA and qnrB10. All strains carried the blaTEM gene; one strain was posi-
tive for the CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum b-lactamase.

Conclusions: Our ﬁndings suggest that food animals could represent an important reservoir of PMQR in this region
of Africa. Previous studies reported high prevalence of qnr genes in clinical isolates from humans in Nigeria,
suggesting that the spread of these resistance determinants in this country could be particularly relevant.

Introduction
Rapid dissemination of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance
(PMQR)
in Enterobacteriaceae has been described in recent
years.1 Three major PMQR mechanisms have been described so
far: Qnr proteins (QnrA, QnrB, QnrS, QnrC, QnrVC and QnrD)
capable of protecting DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV from qui-
′
nolones; Aac(6
)-Ib-cr aminoglycoside acetyltransferase, which
modifies the quinolones with a piperazinyl substituent; and efﬂux
pump proteins QepA and OqxAB, which increase the MICs of cipro-
ﬂoxacin.1 These mechanisms have been identiﬁed in both clinically
resistant and susceptible isolates, contributing to an increase in
MICs of nalidixic acid and ciproﬂoxacin of 2- to 8-fold and 8- to
32-fold for resistant and susceptible isolates, respectively.1

Information on the prevalence of these resistance determi-
nants in developing countries is scarce. A recent study reported

high rates of resistance to quinolones and b-lactam antibiotics
among Gram-negative enteric isolates from different hospitals in
Nigeria and a surveillance study on zoonotic pathogens identiﬁed
salmonella strains carrying the qnrS1 gene.2 – 4 In this study we
characterized PMQR determinants, b-lactamases, plasmids and
strains among commensal Escherichia coli isolated from healthy
chickens and pigs at slaughter in the city of Ibadan, Nigeria.

Materials and methods
Isolation of bacteria
From November to December 2006, a total of 200 faecal samples were
randomly collected from 100 chickens and 100 pigs originating from
different
in Ibadan, Nigeria, plated on eosin/
methylene blue agar containing 100 mg/L ampicillin and incubated

aerobically at 378C for 18–24 h. Presumptive E. coli colonies were ident-
iﬁed by standard methods. Three qnrS1-positive Salmonella enterica
Derby strains from chickens from Nigeria3 were included in this study
for plasmid comparison.

Antimicrobial susceptibility
E. coli strains were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by a disc diffu-
sion method following the European Committee on Antimicrobial Suscep-
tibility

Strain typing, PMQR and b-lactamase gene identiﬁcation
The genetic relatedness of the strains was determined by enterobacterial
repetitive intergenic consensus–PCR (ERIC–PCR); strains differing for
more than two bands were classiﬁed in different ERIC types, strains dif-
fering for two bands were classiﬁed in the same ERIC type, but differen-
tiated by letters (i.e. 7a–7b, 6a–6b–6c).5
′
The qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, qnrC, qnrD, aac(6

)-Ib-cr, qepA, oqxAB, blaTEM and
blaLAP genes were screened using previously described primers and con-
ditions.6 The blaCTX-M and blaSHV genes were searched in strain Z3.6 PCR
products were fully sequenced.

Plasmids
Plasmid DNA was puriﬁed by Qiagen Plasmid Midi kit (Qiagen, Inc., Milan,
Italy) and used to transform Top10 E. coli chemically competent cells
(Invitrogen, Milan, Italy). Since the MIC of ciproﬂoxacin for the E. coli reci-
pient was 0.03 mg/L, transformants were selected on Luria–Bertani (LB)
agar plates containing 0.06 mg/L ciproﬂoxacin or 50 mg/L ampicillin.
Conjugation experiments were performed at 258C by liquid mating
assay using rifampicin-resistant E. coli CSH26 as recipient and selecting
transconjugants on LB agar plates supplemented with 100 mg/L rifampi-
cin and 0.06 mg/L ciproﬂoxacin. Plasmids were assigned to incompatibil-
ity groups by PCR-based replicon typing (PBRT).7

IncHI2 and IncI1 plasmids were further typed by plasmid multilocus
sequence typing (pMLST; www.pubmlst.org/plasmid/). A HindIII library
was obtained from a prototypic IncX2 plasmid. Several recombinant
clones were randomly selected and fully sequenced.

Results
One hundred and sixty-two ampicillin-resistant E. coli strains, 96
from chickens and 66 from pigs, were isolated from 200 faecal
samples obtained from healthy animals at slaughter in the city
of Ibadan, Nigeria. Chickens and pigs were produced locally for
the Nigerian market and for meat exportation to neighbouring
west African countries. Eighty-nine ampicillin-resistant strains
(55%) showed resistance or reduced susceptibility to ﬂuoroqui-
nolones; 69/96 (72%) strains from chickens and 2/66 (3%)
from pigs showed ciproﬂoxacin MICs .4.0 mg/L and 13/96
(13.5%) and 5/66 (7.5%) strains from chickens and pigs, respect-
ively, showed reduced susceptibility to ciproﬂoxacin with MICs
ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 mg/L. Strain Z3 was unique in
showing resistance to cephalosporins. PMQR genes were
searched for among these 89 strains.

Eighteen isolates (20%) were positive for one or more PMQR
genes and 12 of them were from the group showing reduced
susceptibility to ciproﬂoxacin: 15 strains were from chickens;
and three strains were from pigs. Higher levels of resistance to

target genes and were not

Among the PMQR determinants, 12 strains carried qnrS1, 3
strains carried qnrB19, 1 strain carried qnrB10 and 3 strains
carried qepA1; 1 carried both qepA1 and qnrB10. None of the iso-
′
lates carried qnrA, qnrC, qnrD, aac(6
)-1b-cr or oqxAB genes.
Ampicillin resistance was associated with the presence of the
blaTEM-1 gene in all the strains; strains were negative for blaLAP.
Strain Z3 was positive for the blaCTX-M-15 gene (Table 1).

PMQR strains were typed by ERIC–PCR and identical proﬁles
(proﬁle no. 1 in Table 1) were obtained for the three strains of
swine origin and two strains from chickens. The remaining 13 iso-
lates were discriminated in seven different ERIC proﬁles.

PMQR-positive transformants were successfully obtained from
13/18 parental strains by transformation of the recipient E. coli,
on agar plates containing 0.06 mg/L ciproﬂoxacin. The Z46, Z39
and Z41 strains positively transferred PMQR-positive plasmids
by conjugation. PMQR determinants were not transferred from
strains Z14 and Z31, but ampicillin-resistant transformants
were obtained from strain Z14 on agar plates containing
100 mg/L ampicillin.

All the strains transferred the PMQR genes in association with

blaTEM-1 (Table 1).

The qnrS1 genes were located on three different plasmid
types: IncI1; IncN; and IncX2. The IncI1 plasmids from E. coli
and those from Salmonella carrying qnrS1/blaTEM-1 (Z13, S88,
S121 and S266) or the blaTEM-1 gene only (Z14) were all assigned
to the same ST12 sequence type by pMLST, suggesting a
common plasmid circulating among commensal and pathogenic
bacteria.

The qepA1 gene was located on IncHI2 plasmids that were
further typed by pMLST and assigned to the ST2 sequence
type. The qnrB19 gene was located on ColE-like plasmids that
were similar to the pTPqnrS-1a plasmid previously described in
Salmonella Typhimurium (AM46977).

Since pMLST was not available for the IncX2 plasmids, recom-
binant clones of a random library obtained from the prototypic
IncX2 plasmid (Z10) were selected and fully sequenced. Approxi-
mately 10 kb were sequenced demonstrating that this plasmid
showed 97%–99% nucleotide identity with the partially
sequenced IncX2 reference plasmid R6K (EMBL accession
numbers Y10906.1, X95535.1, J01779.1, J01776.1 and M11000).

Discussion
The results obtained in this study showed that PMQR determi-
nants were highly prevalent
in commensal strains from
healthy animals in Nigeria. In particular, a multifocal distribution
of strains was observed,
identifying four PMQR gene variants
located on ﬁve different
(qnrB10, qnrB19, qnrS1 and qepA1),
plasmid types (IncHI2, ColE,
IncI1,
IncN and IncX2). This
impressively high variability of genes, plasmids and strains
suggests wide circulation of resistance determinants among
the faecal ﬂora of healthy food-producing animals in this
country. Our study suggests that the dissemination of these
PMQR determinants is mostly due to the transmission of suc-
cessful plasmids by horizontal exchange rather than to the
spread of speciﬁc bacterial clones. The most

encountered plasmid type in E. coli analysed in this study
belonged to the IncX2 family, which is a very rarely reported
plasmid family.8 In contrast, the other two plasmid types,
IncI1 and IncN, are frequently identiﬁed worldwide in enterobac-
teria, being among the most prevalent plasmid families in com-
mensal avian strains from the USA in collections not biased for
antimicrobial resistance.8 Interestingly, we demonstrated that
the same plasmid type (IncI1 sequence type ST12) identiﬁed
in commensal E. coli was also detected in Salmonella strains col-
lected in independent surveillance studies performed in this
country in two different time periods. Small ColE-like plasmids
harbouring qnrB19 or qnrS1 have been described worldwide in
commensal E. coli and in Salmonella from the Netherlands, the
UK, Germany, Colombia, Bolivia, Peru and in this study from
Nigeria, suggesting that they could be very common in Entero-
bacteriaceae, being disseminated in different species of entero-
bacteria in different countries from both human and animal
sources.8 The identiﬁcation of the qepA gene was unexpected
since this resistance determinant is not commonly identiﬁed in
strains from food-producing animals but was recently identiﬁed
in Enterobacteriaceae of human origin in Nigeria.2

Antibiotics are used in animal production in Nigeria because
they are available over the counter without prescription, but
the use of ﬂuoroquinolones for growth promotion, prophylaxis
and treatment of food animals still seems rare in this country,
because these drugs are relatively expensive.9,10 However,
PMQR-positive isolates could be positively selected by other

drugs thanks to the association of multiple resistance determi-
nants and transmitted to humans through the food chain.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria carried by animals can enter the
human food chain through the consumption of meat or by
direct contact. In Africa PMQR determinants have already been
demonstrated to be prevalent in Enterobacteriaceae of human
origin from Nigeria.2 The prevalence observed could therefore
derive from dissemination of these resistance determinants in
food-producing animals.
