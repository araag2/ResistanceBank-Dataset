Abstract

Seventy strains of staphylococci isolated from goat clinical and subclinical mastitis in Brazilian dairy herds were submitted
to identiﬁcation and antimicrobial susceptibility tests. Staphylococcus aureus represented 37% of the isolates from subclinical
mastitis and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) 60%. Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus caprae, Staphylococcus
capitis subsp. ureolyticus, Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus chromogenes and Staphylococcus
saccharolyticus were the CNS species identiﬁed in decreasing order of occurrence. Penicillin G was the drug that demonstrated
the highest in vitro resistance rates when tested against both S. aureus and CNS. The difference observed in the efﬁcacy of
the drugs tested shows the importance of carrying out the identiﬁcation and antimicrobial susceptibility tests of the mastitis
agents.

1. Introduction

Members of the genus Staphylococcus are the main
aetiological agents involved in all forms of mastitis in
goats. Although S. aureus has been considered the ma-
jor pathogen, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS)
are the most commonly observed, principally in sub-

clinical mastitis (Castro et al., 1992; Lima Júnior et al.,
1993; Contreras et al., 1995, 1999; Bedidi-Madani
et al., 1998).

The control and preventive measures against caprine
mastitis are similar to those used for bovine masti-
tis, including pre- and post-milking teat desinfection,
clinical mastitis therapy, dry therapy and proper use of
the milking equipment (Poutrel et al., 1997; Menzies
and Ramanoon, 2001). Antibiotic treatment is one of
the recommended approaches in order to reduce in-
tramammary infection (IMI) and, consequently, the
prevalence of mastitis in the herd (Brito and Brito,
1998). However, the indiscriminate use of antimicro-
bial agents either for treatment of mastitis or any other

infection might generate an increase of the resistance
level of many microrganisms to these drugs (Contreras
et al., 1995). Thus, knowledge of the bacterial agents
responsible for mastitis cases as well as their proﬁle
of susceptibility to drugs should improve rates of IMI
cure and reduce bacterial resistance.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to iden-
tify the Staphylococcus species responsible for intra-
mammary infections in Brazilian dairy herds and to
determine their susceptibility to different drugs.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Bacterial strains

Seventy Staphylococcus strains isolated from goat
clinical and subclinical mastitis were used. The strains
were obtained from milk samples collected from ani-
mals belonging to dairy herds of the Brazilian Agency
of Agricultural Research—National Goat Research
Center (Embrapa, Caprinos) located in the district of
Sobral, Ceará. The collection of milk samples and
bacteriological analyse were carried out according to
National Mastitis Council (1990). Subclinical mas-
titis was considered when three or more colonies of
the same bacterial type were observed in the primary
cultures of two consecutive milk samples of the same
animal (Deinhofer and Pernthaner, 1995). The bac-
terial genus was determined on the basis of Gram
staining, colony morphology and catalase test. The
colonies identiﬁed as Staphylococcus were submitted
to the tube coagulase test using rabbit plasma (Quinn
et al., 1994). The isolates were kept frozen at −20
C
in skim milk containing 15% (v/v) glycerol, until
species identiﬁcation and antimicrobial susceptibility
tests were carried out.

◦

2.2. Identiﬁcation of Staphylococcus species

For the species identiﬁcation the key proposed by
Kloos (1990) was used. Coagulase-negative staphy-
lococci were grouped according to the susceptibility
proﬁle towards Novobiocin (5 ␮g). The Novobiocin
resistant group was submitted to tests of sucrose,
d-mannose, d-cellobiose, d-xylose, l-arabinose and
rafﬁnose fermentation, reduction of nitrate and ure-
ase activity. For the susceptible group, arginine uti-

lization, urease activity and d-trehalose, maltose,
d-mannitol, d-mannose and sucrose fermentation
tests were used. The coagulase-positive staphylococci
were identiﬁed by the thermonuclease test, acetoin
production and aerobic fermentation of sucrose, d-
mannose, d-cellobiose, d-xylose, l-arabinose, rafﬁ-
nose, d-trehalose, maltose and d-mannitol. All tests
were performed as described by Quinn et al. (1994)
and MacFaddin (2000).

2.3. Antimicrobial susceptibility test

Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by
agar diffusion test, according to NCCLS (1999) and
using the following drugs: Penicillin G 10 U, Ery-
thromycin 15 ␮g, Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole
1.25/23.75 ␮g, Tetracycline 30 ␮g, Cephalothin 30 ␮g
and Oxacillin 1 ␮g. The zones of growth inhibition
were evaluated as recommended by NCCLS (1999).
Reference strains from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) were used and included: Staphy-
lococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Enterococcus
faecalis ATCC 29212.

3. Results

A summary of the identiﬁed staphylococci species
is shown in Table 1. Overall, ﬁve (7.14%) of the
strains were isolated from clinical mastitis: four were
S. aureus and one Staphylococcus warneri. Of the
65 isolates from subclinical mastitis, S. aureus was
identiﬁed in 37% and CNS in 60%. Staphylococ-
cus warneri, Staphylococcus caprae, Staphylococcus
capitis subsp. ureolyticus, Staphylococcus sciuri,
Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus chromo-
genes and Staphylococcus saccharolyticus were the
CNS species identiﬁed. We were unable to speciﬁcally
identify 10% of the isolates: two of the coagulase-
positive staphylococci and ﬁve CNS.

Antimicrobial susceptibility tests (Table 2) showed
that of the S. aureus strains, 64% were suscepti-
ble to Penicillin G, 86% to Erythromycin, 96% to
Oxacillin and 100% were susceptible to Cephalothin,
Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole
and Tetracycline.
Among the coagulase-negative species,
the re-
sults obtained were: 40% susceptible to Peni-
cillin G, 77.5% susceptible to Oxacillin, 87.5% to

the

cline/Penicillin G, seven to Oxacillin/Penicillin G, one
to Erythromycin/Penicillin G and one to Trimetho-
prim/Sulfamethoxazole/Cephalothin/Penicillin G.

4. Discussion

Staphylococci are the bacteria most frequently
isolated from goat mastitis and are thus consid-
ered the most
important aetiological agents for
this infection. In the early studies, S. aureus was
isolated in a small number of subclinical mastitis
cases (Kalogridou-Vassiliadou, 1991; Deinhofer and
Pernthaner, 1995; Contreras et al., 1999). However,
in the present investigation, it was identiﬁed in 37%
of the subclinical mastitits isolates. Failure to ap-
ply the dry therapy might have contributed to the
maintenance of S. aureus in the goat’s mammary
glands in the herds in this study. Because of its
pathogenicity S. aureus must be considered an im-
portant caprine mastitis agent since it is responsible
for chronic, clinical and subclinical IMI as well as
for gangrenous mastitis with very high morbidity
and mortality rates. Moreover, S. aureus is frequently
resistant to antibiotic therapy due to its capacity to
produce an exopolysaccharide barrier and because of
its location within microabscesses, which limit the
action of the drugs (Contreras et al., 2000). Since
infected animals may pass on this microrganism in
milk, they represent source of infection for the herd
and a serious danger to public health. Therefore, it is
most important to identify those animals harbouring
S. aureus.

In the present study, CNS were the most fre-
quently isolated organisms in the subclinical IMI.
This ﬁnding is consistent with other studies (Castro
et al., 1992; Lima Júnior et al., 1993; Contreras
et al., 1995, 1999; Bedidi-Madani et al., 1998).
Some of
these subclinical mastitis isolates were
human-associated CNS as described by many inves-
tigators (Kalogridou-Vassiliadou, 1991; Maisi and
Riipinen, 1991; Castro et al., 1992; Contreras et al.,
1995, 1999; Bedidi-Madani et al., 1998). Besides
its association with subclinical mastitis, S. warneri
was identiﬁed as the only agent in hyperacute clin-
ical mastitis case, indicating that CNS may express
pathogenic factors capable of causing mastitis with
similar clinical features to S. aureus mastitis. The
presence of this and other human-associated CNS in-
dicate that humans must be considered as a possible
source of infection for the goats mammary gland.

Among the six antibiotics tested against the identi-
ﬁed species, Penicillin G was the least effective. Most
of the CNS species demonstrated high resistance lev-
els to this drug, with S. capitis subsp. ureolyticus, S.
sciuri and S. chromogenes strains showing 100% of re-
sistance. Resistance of goat CNS isolates to penicillin
G was also described by Lima Júnior et al. (1993) and
Corrales et al. (1995) who observed resistance rates
of 41.18 and 75%, respectively. The Penicillin G also
showed low efﬁcacy against S. aureus that was similar
to results reported by Lima Júnior et al. (1993) who
found 41.67% of Penicillin G resistance. The resis-
tance to Penicillin G observed in this research must be
of concern since this drug represents the main antibi-
otic group recommended for staphylococcal mastitis
treatment.

In this investigation it was also observed that
some of
the CNS species had low susceptibil-
ity to penicilinase-resistant penicillins (PRPs). The
Oxacillin resistance demonstrated by S. capitis
subsp. ureolyticus, S. sciuri and S. simulans indicates
that the CNS group has a potential capacity to develop
resistance mechanisms to this drug. Hinckley et al.
(1985) testing CNS isolated from goat’s milk reported
82% of PRPs resistance using Cloxacillin as repre-
sentative of that group. Oxacillin resistant CNS might
compromise the IMI elimination, since these species
are the main agents of goat subclinical mastitis and
Oxacillin and related drugs are the main components
of the antibiotic formulations for the dry therapy.

In conclusion, this study showed that CNS species
are the agents most commonly involved in subclinical
mastitis in the National Goat Research Center herds.
In addition, the differences observed in the efﬁcacy of
the drugs tested shows the importance of antimicro-
bial susceptibility tests, performed together with iden-
tiﬁcation of the bacterial agents.
