Abstract
Livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) is a cause of zoonotic infections in many coun-
tries. People with occupational contact with food animal production are at risk of colonization. The aim of this study was to
determine the prevalence of MRSA and their frequency of resistance to other antimicrobial agents from broilers and workers at
the ‘pluck shops’ in Trinidad. For isolation of MRSA, choanal, cloacal and pharyngeal swabs taken from broilers and nasal swabs
from humans were enriched then plated on CHROMagar MRSA and Brilliance MRSA. MRSA was confirmed using the PBP2a
test kit, resistance to oxacillin and cefoxitin and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the mecA gene. Antimicrobial resistance of
the MRSA isolates to 16 antimicrobial agents was determined using the disc diffusion method. Of the 287 broilers and 47 humans
sampled, MRSA was isolated at a frequency of 2 (0.7%) and 0 (0.0%) respectively. All the MRSA isolates exhibited resistance to
one or more of the 16 antimicrobial agents. The study demonstrated that broilers at ‘pluck shops’ in Trinidad harbor MRSA. This
is the first isolation of MRSA from poultry in Trinidad, West Indies, and this finding is of public health significance since
occupational exposure of humans can lead to increased risk of acquiring MRSA infections.

Introduction

Livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (LA-MRSA) is a zoonotic pathogen which has been
reported in various animals, including pigs, cattle, poultry and
sheep (Verkade and Kluytmans 2014). People working with
livestock are at high risk of infections caused by MRSA
(Cuny et al. 2015). LA-MRSA primarily belongs to multilocus
sequence type 398 but ST9 and ST5 have also been reported
(Kraushaar et al. 2017).

In Trinidad and Tobago, the southernmost island in the
Caribbean, broilers account for 88% of the meat consumed

(Baboolal et al. 2012). Cottage or small-scale poultry processors
called ‘pluck shops’ are widely patronized by consumers for
dressed broilers. MRSA has been documented in broilers and
the workers in contact with them elsewhere (Mulders et al. 2010).
To date, no published data exist on the occurrence of
MRSA in poultry and workers who are in contact with broilers
at ‘pluck shops’ in Trinidad. The current study was therefore
conducted to determine the prevalence of MRSA in broilers
and workers at ‘pluck shops’ in Trinidad and their resistance
to other antimicrobial agents.

Methodology

This cross-sectional study was conducted between September
2015 and November 2015 in Trinidad. An estimated sample
size of 275 and 81 for broilers and workers respectively was
calculated using the following formula and reported preva-
lence rates (Mulders et al. 2010): n = [t2 × p (1−p)]/m2
(Charan and Biswas 2013) where n = required sample size,
t = confidence level at 95% (standard value of 1.96), p = esti-
mated prevalence of MRSA and m = margin of error.

A convenience sampling approach was used to select the
‘pluck shops’. The study was designed to sample nine broilers
from each ‘pluck shop’; however, in counties with a few num-
bers of ‘pluck shops’, six broilers were sampled.

On arrival at each ‘pluck shop’, a questionnaire was admin-
istered to the manager and to each consenting worker. Three
swab samples from the cloaca, choana and pharynx were col-
lected from each broiler and bilateral nasal swabs from
workers. All participants signed a written consent form.
Each sample was then placed in a tube containing 5 ml of
Amies transport (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, Hampshire,
England), placed on ice and transported to the laboratory with-
in 4 h of sample collection.

MRSA was isolated by incubation in Mueller Hinton broth
(Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, Hampshire, England) with 6.5%
sodium chloride, followed by selective enrichment in phenol
red mannitol broth (Becton Dickinson, Le Pont deClaix,
France) with 75 mg/L aztreonam (Alfa Aaesar, Ward Hill,
Massachusetts, USA) and 5 mg/L ceftizoxime (Tokyo
Chemical Industry Company Limited, Kita Ku, Tokyo,
Japan). The selective enrichment broth (10 μl) was then inoc-
ulated onto CHROMagar MRSA (CHROMagar Limited.
Paris, France) and Brilliance MRSA agar (Oxoid Ltd.,
Basingstoke, Hampshire, England). Characteristic colonies
from CHROMagar MRSA and Brilliance MRSA were then
plated on 5% blood agar plates (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke,
Hampshire, England) (Graveland et al. 2009). All incubation
was at 37 °C for 18–24 h.

All suspected colonies were identified as S. aureus using
standard techniques which included tests for catalase, coagu-
lase and Gram staining. Pure cultures of the isolates identified
as S. aureus were stored at – 70 °C in Brain Heart Infusion
broth (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, Hampshire, England) with
equal volume of 50% glycerol.

MRSA was determined by conventional PCR to detect the
mecA gene (Cho et al. 2007), the PBP2a Latex Agglutination
test (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, Hampshire, England) and anti-
microbial resistance to oxacillin and cefoxitin. ST398 was de-
termined using PCR for the C01 gene (van Wamel et al. 2010).
The susceptibility of the MRSA isolates to the various anti-
microbial agents: streptomycin (S, 10 μg), sulphamethoxazole/
trimethoprim (SXT, 1.75 μg/23.25 μg), tetracycline (TE,
30 μg), penicillin G (P, 10 IU), rifampicin (RD, 5 μg),
clindamycin (DA, 2 μg), gentamicin (CN, 10 μg), erythromy-
cin (E, 15 μg), norfloxacin (NOR, 10 μg), oxacillin (Ox, 1 μg),
vancomycin (VA, 30 μg), ciprofloxacin (CIP, 5 μg), cefoxitin
(FOX, 30 μg), ampicillin (AMP, 10 μg), chloramphenicol (C,
30 μg) and enrofloxacin (ENR, 10 μg), was read and compared
to the chart for zones of resistance (CLSI 2012).

Data for the prevalence study were analyzed using
Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21.
Chi-square (χ2) test was used to determine whether statistical-
ly significant associations existed between prevalence and risk

factors. All significant differences were determined at alpha
(α) = 0.05.

Results

A total of 287 broilers were sampled from 33 ‘pluck shops’
throughout Trinidad. The frequency of detection of MRSA in
broilers was 0.7% (2/287) by PCR for the mecA gene, PBP2a
test and resistance to the antimicrobial agents, oxacillin and
cefoxitin. The two MRSA-positive samples were isolated
from CHROMagar MRSA, one was from the cloaca and the
other choana.

Both MRSA isolates were resistant to cefoxitin, oxacillin,
ampicillin and penicillin. One of the two isolates was resistant
to clindamycin. The two MRSA isolates were susceptible to
rifampicin, erythromycin, tetracycline, gentamycin, strepto-
mycin, norfloxacin, vancomycin, chloramphenicol,
sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin and
enrofloxacin. ST398 was not detected in any of the MRSA
isolates analyzed.

The demographic data for the ‘pluck shops’ are shown in
Table 1. All the risk factors observed had no effect on the
presence of MRSA at the ‘pluck shop’.

A total of 47 human samples were collected from ‘pluck
shops’ throughout Trinidad. The frequency of detection of
MRSA by PCR, resistance to the antimicrobial agent cefoxitin
and the PBP2a test was 0.0% (0/47). However, a frequency of
detection for MRSA of 2.1% (1/47) was observed with
oxacillin.

Discussion

Although a very low prevalence (0.7%) of MRSA was detect-
ed in broilers, this is considered the first documentation of the
existence of MRSA in broilers in the country. This is consid-
erably lower than the prevalence of 4.8% for MRSA
(Nemeghaire et al. 2013) for broilers in Belgium, 6.9% in the
Netherlands (Mulders et al. 2010) and 45.5% in Southeast
Nigeria (Ugwu et al. 2015). The rather low prevalence of
MRSA detected in broilers in our study is an indication that
MRSA strains may not be fully established on broiler farms in
the country. The presence of MRSA, albeit low, is a cause for
concern since it can be transmitted to humans by direct or
indirect contact and also has the potential to cause infections
in both broilers and humans, which are difficult to treat.

In our study, the results of other tests used to detect MRSA
(PBP2a test, resistance to oxacillin and cefoxitin) were com-
parable to PCR for the mecA gene, which is the gold standard
(Pournajaf et al. 2014). This diagnostic strategy will be invalu-
able, accurate and cost-effective to laboratories in developing
countries where the use of PCR may not be possible because

of the cost of the machines, consumables and lack of technical
skills to perform the tests.

Contrary to other reports (Geenen et al. 2013; Wendlandt
et al. 2013), the dominant livestock-associated strain ST398
was not detected in the two MRSA isolates analyzed.
However, ST9 and ST5 strains, not assayed for in the current
study, have also been reported in other countries (Kraushaar
et al. 2017).

Both MRSA isolates were resistant to cefoxitin, oxacillin,
ampicillin and penicillin, all beta-lactams. This was expected
since MRSA is resistant to beta-lactams. One of the two iso-
lates was also resistant to clindamycin. Resistance of MRSA
from poultry to clindamycin has also been reported in the
Netherlands (Mulders et al. 2010) and in Nigeria (Ugwu
et al. 2015).

It was a surprise that both MRSA isolates were susceptible
to tetracycline contrary to the high frequency of resistance of
MRSA strains to tetracycline reported by others (Nemeghaire

et al. 2013; Ugwu et al. 2015) and the fact that tetracycline is
one of the commonly used antibiotics in Trinidad and resis-
tance is usually associated with frequent use (Schmithausen
et al. 2015). However, susceptibility of MRSA to tetracycline
in the current report compares favorably with the report in the
USA (Abdalrahman et al. 2015) where MRSA isolates were
all sensitive to tetracycline. The susceptibility of MRSA
strains to the other antimicrobial agents may be due to a lower
frequency of use on the farms due to cost and unavailability.
The prevalence of MRSA (0.0%) in ‘pluck shop’ workers
in Trinidad and Tobago was comparable to the reported fre-
quency of 0.0% in Switzerland (Huber et al. 2010) but lower
than the 5.6% and 6.9% in the Netherlands (Mulders et al.
2010) and Korea (Moon et al. 2015) respectively.

Resistance to oxacillin and cefoxitin is used in many labo-
ratories to report MRSA in Trinidad. In the present study, one
of the human S. aureus isolates was resistant to oxacillin;
however, it was negative by both PCR for the mecA gene
and the PBP2a test. This emphasizes the need to subject
MRSA strains detected by the disc diffusion method to other
more specific tests such as PBP2a tests, prior to instituting
antibiotic therapy in humans.

This study has demonstrated the occurrence of MRSA in
broilers in Trinidad and poses public health threat to humans
because workers in contact with broilers are at increased risk
of acquiring MRSA infections.
