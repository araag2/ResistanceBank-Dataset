Abstract

Aim: To study the prevalence of pathogenic coagulase positive, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in 
poultry meat and its products. 
Materials and Methods: A total of 125 poultry samples were collected during 2012 in Qena governorate for presence of 
pathogenic  coagulase  positive,  methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus  aureus  (MRSA).  Samples  were  taken  from  freshly 
slaughtered whole chicken carcasses (25/125), chicken portions (25/125), chicken luncheon (25/125), chicken sausages 
(25/125) and chicken burgers (25/125).
Results: It was observed that 44% (11/25), 52% (13/25), 40% (10/25), 24% (6/25) and 44% (11/25) of bacterial isolates were 
positive for methicillin-resistance tests for freshly slaughtered whole chicken carcasses, chicken portions, chicken luncheon, 
chicken sausages and chicken burgers respectively. Higher contamination rate of MRSA was found in raw poultry meat and 
the lower rate in poultry meat products subjected to heat treatment and preservatives. 
Conclusion: Poultry meat and its products were considered as an important source of spreading of MRSA in humans. Hence, 
strict hygienic measures should be taken in poultry slaughter houses and in food preparing establishments.

Introduction

Staphylococcus aureus is a gram positive, coagulase 
positive  coccoid  belonging  to  family  Staphyloco-
ccaceae  [1].  It  is  present  on  the  skin  and  mucous 
membranes of humans and animals [2] and is highly 
vulnerable to destruction by heat treatment and nearly 
all  sanitizing  agents.Presence  of  this  bacteria  or  its 
enterotoxins in processed foods or on food processing 
equipments is generally an indicator of poor sanitation. 
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 
is known to be one of the most prevalent nosocomial 
pathogens  throughout  the  world  and  is  capable  of 
causing a wide range of food poisoning, pneumonia, 
post  operative  wound  infections  and  nosocomial 
infections [3, 4]. MRSA strains are especially one of the 
great public concerns since the treatment of infections is 
more difficult when encountering resistance [5, 6] and 
considered  one  of  the  important  agents  of  food 
poisoning around the world [7].

possible  public  health  problems  [9].  Contaminated 
poultry  meat  can  transfer  expressive  amounts  of  S. 
aureus to stainless steel and polyethylene surfaces [10, 
11].  Since  MRSA  infections  have  become  a  public 
health  concern  in  both  communities  and  hospitals, 
testing  for  the  presence  of  MRSA  in  poultry  meat 
during  slaughtering  operations  is  warranted  [12]. 
Treating S. aureus infection has been complicated by 
the  emergence  of  drug  resistant  strains.  MRSA 
infection is now a serious public health problem [13] 
and the poultry meat has been implicated as a main 
source of MRSA in humans [14]. 

It  is  well  known  that  the  organism  produces 
various  extracellular  active  substances,  such  as 
coagulase,  hemolysins,  nuclease,  acid  phosphatase, 
lipase,  protease,  fibrinolysin,  enterotoxins  and  toxic 
shock  syndrome  toxin.  These  active  substances  are 
thought  to  contribute  to  the  pathogenicity  of  the 
organism  [15]. It is reported that strains of S. aureus 
which  had  strong  proteolytic  activity  were  isolated 
The  presence  of  S.  aureus  in  meat  is  often 
from chickens suffering from edematous and necrotic 
attributed to inadequate hygiene during handling by the 
dermatitis [16], where in dermatolysis was observed in 
individuals  involved  in  the  production  of  meat  [8].

processes through its support to the persistence of these 
strains in the fatty secretions in mammalian skin, and 
thus  have  an  indirect  influence  on  their  pathogenic 
potential  [17,18].  S.  aureus  isolates  from  chicken 
carcasses showed proteolytic and lipolytic activity at

In  this  study,  the  prevalence  of  methicillin-
resistant S. aureus in poultry meat and poultry meat 
products  were  investigated,  this  prevalence  ranged 
from  24-52  %,  with  mean  of  40  %.  The  findings 
revealed  that  the  prevalence  of  MRSA  in  whole 
chicken carcasses, chicken portions, chicken luncheon, 
chicken sausages and chicken burgers were 44 %, 52 
%, 40 %, 24 % and 44 % respectively. These results in 
our study were agreed with some other studies such as

Conclusion

Staphylococcal food poisoning is one of the most 
important  causes  of  food  borne  diseases  especially 
MRSA which is now a serious health problem in both 
hospitals  and  community.  MRSA  contamination  of 
meat  increases  the  emergence  of  antimicrobial 
resistance to the human. Poultry meat and its products 
are considered as one of the main sources of spreading 
of MRSA in humans. Therefore, proper handling of 
raw  meat,  adequate  cleaning  of  hands,  surfaces, 
equipments, disinfection of poultry slaughter houses, 
vehicles  and  good  personal  hygiene  can  reduce 
spreading of MRSA.

It  is  observed  in  our  study  that  all  methicillin-
resistant isolates were positive for coagulase test, but 
not all typical colonies on Baird Parker agar with halo 
zone were positive either for coagulase test or for latex 
agglutination test for methicillin resistance. Also, it is 
observed that the highest contamination rate was in raw 
chicken portions (52 %) followed by whole chicken 
carcasses (44 %) and chicken burgers (44 %) and this is 
can be attributed to the raw nature of these types of 
meat and partially due to frequent handling of these 
meats by hands of workers in poultry slaughter houses

Different  stages  of  slaughter  such  as  scalding, 
defeathering  and  chilling  may  affect  the  prevalence 
and bacterial load of S.aureus on the carcass [36, 37]. 
High contamination of S.aureus is the principal reason 
for the inadequate microbiological quality of chicken 
meat sold in common markets [38]. It is reported that 
the presence of S.aureus in foods commonly indicates 
contamination that may be directly introduced into the 
food  by  workers  when  have  skin  lesions  containing 
S.aureus  or  sneezing  or  coughing  [39]  or  indirectly 
through working surfaces and knives [40]. Contami-
nation of the meat products by MRSA could be traced 
back to poor hygienic and sanitary conditions in Egypt 
[41].

The  rates  of  resistance  to  other  antimicrobial 
agents  were  higher  in  MRSA  than  in  methicillin 
susceptible  strains.  A  strong  correlation  between 
methicillin  resistance  and  co-resistance  to  non-ß-
lactam antibiotics has been reported [42, 43, 44]. The

chromosomes cassette mec and has been implicated as
