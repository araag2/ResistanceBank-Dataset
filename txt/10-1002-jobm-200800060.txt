This study was conducted to determine the prevalence rate of VTEC in slaughtered sheep and 
goats and to evaluate the contamination rate of VTEC in slaughterhouses and butchers’ shops 
in southern Jordan. 201 E. coli isolates from animals’ faecal samples and 33 E. coli isolates from 
slaughterhouse/butcher shop samples were characterized by multiplex PCR (mPCR) reaction for 
detection  of  stx1,  stx2,  eae A  and  E-hly  A  virulent  genes.  Twenty-six  virulent  E.  coli  isolates  
were  characterized  by  mPCR  to  seven  different  virulent  patterns:  stx1,  stx1+stx2,  stx1+eae A, 
stx1+E-hly A,  stx1+eae A+E-hly A,  eae A  and  E-hly A.  It  was  found  that  VTEC  comprised  6.4%  and 
21%  of  the  total  E. coli  isolates  from  slaughtered  small  ruminants  and  slaughterhouses/ 
butchers’  shops,  respectively.  The  VTEC  comprised  76.2%  of  the  virulent  isolates.  The 
proportion  of  stx1:stx1+stx2  patterns  was  19 : 1.  It  was  found  that  the  characterized  complex 
VTEC  (containing  eae A  and/or  E-hly A)  possessed  three  virulence  patterns,  including  (VTEC) 
stx1+eae A, (VTEC/EHEC) stx1+E-hly A and (VTEC/EHEC) stx1+eae A+E-hly A in percentages of 30%, 
25% and 10%, respectively, in relation to the total VTEC isolates. Only two VTEC isolates were 
characterized as E. coli O157 and O26 serotypes, as highly pathogenic strains. Each of the O157 
and O26 VTEC isolates was in a percentage of 0.4% in relation to the total E. coli isolates with 
virulent patterns stx1, eae A and E-hly A. The rest of the VTEC isolates were non-O157 VTEC. The 
antibiotic sensitivity test showed that the isolated VTEC was highly sensitive to gentamicin and 
co-trimoxazole and highly resistant to tetracycline and ampicillin.

Introduction1 

Verotoxigenic  (Shigatoxeginic)  Escherichia  coli  (VTEC) 
strains have wide notoriety [1]. More than 200 different 
O,  H  serotypes  of  STEC/VTEC  serotypes  have  been  iso-
lated  and  the  number  associated  with  human  illness 
exceeds 100 [2, 3]. A majority of the reported outbreaks 
and  sporadic  cases  of  such  illnesses  have  been  associ-
ated  with  serotype  O157 : H7  [4].  In  a  survey  of  cattle

and sheep presented for slaughter at abattoirs in Great 
Britain,  4.7%  of  cattle  and  1.7%  of  sheep  contained  
E. coli O157 in the faeces [5]. 
  A  few  studies  have  demonstrated  that  animals  in-
cluding  cows,  sheep,  goats  and  pigs  are  reservoirs  for 
different  VTEC  strains  [6 – 8].  Evidence  has  suggested 
that VTEC is better adapted to persist in the alimentary 
tract  of  sheep  than  other  pathotypes  of  E. coli  [9].  Most 
VTEC  infections  in  humans  are  connected  to  the  con-
sumption  of  contaminated  food  and  water,  but  trans-
mission  by  contact  with  infected  farm  animals  and 
person-to-person  contact  has  also  been  documented 
[10]. VTEC is capable of producing toxins active in Vero-
cells  in  vitro  named  verotoxins  (also  called  shiga-like

toxins  “stx”)  [11].  Two  kinds  of  stx  can  be  produced  by 
VTEC:  stx1  and  stx2  [12].  The  biological  effects  of  stx 
take  place  generally  once  it  is  bound  to  a  target  eu-
karyotic  cell  membrane.  Toxin  molecules  are  thought 
to  be  internalized  by  a  process  of  receptor-mediated 
endocytosis [13, 14]. 
  The production of stx alone may not be sufficient for 
VTEC to cause disease [15]. Other virulence factors may 
play  a  role  in  VETC  pathogenicity,  including  intimin 
(encoded by the  eae  A gene), which is required for inti-
mate  adherence  of  these  pathogens  to  tissue  culture 
cells  and  formation  of  the  attaching  and  effacing  (A/E) 
lesion [16]. The formation of A/E lesions is mediated by 
multiple  genes  called  the  Locus  of  Enterocyte  Efface-
ment  (LEE)  [17].  Another  virulence  factor  that  contrib-
utes  to  VTEC  pathogenicity  is  the  60-MDa  plasmid-
borne enterohaemolysin  A  gene (encoded by the E-hly A 
gene). 
  The  VETC  of  serotype  O157  or  those  that  have  spe-
cific  combinations  of  virulence  factors  appear  to  be 
more virulent in mankind [12]. VTEC can be associated 
with  different  diseases  in  humans,  including  haemor-
rhagic  colitis  (HC),  which  is  characterized  by  bloody 
diarrhoea,  haemolytic-uraemic  syndrome  (HUS),  which 
may  result  in  life-threatening  sequelae  (renal  failure) 
and  thrombotic  thrombocytopenic  purpora 
(TTP), 
through  which  the  central  nervous  system  is  mainly 
affected [18]. 
  Ruminants are an important reservoir of pathogenic 
VTEC  and  human  infections  are  frequently  associated 
with  direct  or  indirect  contact  with  ruminant  faeces. 
Strategies  to  reduce  the  prevalence  of  VTEC  in  rumi-
nants  should  lower  the  incidence  of  human  infection 
[19]. The need for hygienic meat production has gained 
importance, due to awareness among consumers about 
health risks associated with contaminated meat [20]. 
  The main  objective of this  study was  to characterize 
VTEC  strains  isolated  from  the  faeces  of  small  rumi-
nants  and  environmental  samples  from  the  southern 
part of Jordan. 

Materials and methods 

Study design 
During a period between June and October 2006, a sin-
gle  faecal  sample  was  obtained  from  233  slaughtered 
sheep  and  169  goats  respectively  (Fig. 1).  Samples  were 
collected  randomly  from  six  slaughterhouses  and  16 
butchers’ shops, located in the southern part of Jordan. 
Faecal  samples  were  collected  by  obtaining  colon  con-
tents  from  each  slaughtered  animal;  by  ligation  of  the 

colon  in  two  sites  5 – 10 cm  long,  then  transections 
from  these  ends.  Thus,  we  avoided  the  contamination 
of faecal samples from slaughterhouse or butcher shop 
sites.  The  intestinal  sample  (in  between  the  two  ends) 
was transferred immediately, on ice, within two to four 
hours  to  the  laboratory.  Samples  were  collected  over  a 
period of five months, during which two collection sites 
per  week  were  selected  randomly  within  one  gover-
norate.  Information  on  the  sources  of  slaughtered  ani-
mals was recorded. 
 
In  addition  to  the  faecal  contents,  57  drag  swabs 
(Solar  Biologicals  Inc.,  New  York,  USA)  from  six  differ-
ent  slaughterhouses  and  16  butchers’  shops  were  col-
lected  and  tested  for  VTEC  presence.  Drag  swabs  were 
obtained from the walls and floors of the premises. The 
visits to the premises were sudden, and no cleaning was 
intentionally  practised  before  sampling.  Drag  swabs 
were  carefully  opened  and  floors  and  walls  were 
swabbed  in  a  circular  motion.  The  swabs  were  placed 
directly  in  bags  that  contained  special  transfer  media. 
After incubation for 24 hours, swabs were sub-cultured 
in the enrichment media. 

Sample processing 
In  the  case  of  the  intestinal  samples,  the  colon  was 
opened aseptically and the faecal matter was harvested. 
Approximately  1 g  from  each  sample  was  inoculated 
into  9 ml  MacConkey  broth  (DIFCO,  MD,  USA  )  supple-
mented  with  cefixime  (0.05 mg/l).  After  incubation  at 
37 °C  for  24 h,  a  loopful  was  streaked  on  sorbitol  Mac-
Conkey  (DIFCO,  MD,  USA)  agar  medium  supplemented 
with  cefexime  (0.05  mg/l)  (CSMAC)  and  SMAC  agar  
[21].  The  plates  were  incubated  at  37 °C  for  24 h.  Both 
sorbitol-fermenting  colonies  (small  red/pink)  and  non-
fermenting  colonies  (colourless)  were  selected  for  con-
formation.  The  number  of  colonies  selected  varied  for 
each sample, but as a general rule one to three colonies 
were  taken.  E. coli  suspected  colonies  were  inoculated  
in  tryptic  soy  slants  and  incubated  for  24 h  at  37 °C  
and  then  stored  at  4 °C.  E. coli  isolates  were  identified  
by  phenotypic  characterization  and  conventional  bio-
chemical activities using an IMViC test (a positive iden-
tification of E. coli required results to be positive for the 
indole  and  methyl  red  test,  negative  for  the  Voges-
Proskauer and citrate utilization tests). All materials for 
the IMViC tests were obtained from DIFCO, MD, USA. 
  Drag  swabs  were  processed  similarly.  The  morpho-
logical characteristics of bacterial isolates were studied  
and  their  biochemical  identity  was  determined  using 
the  REMEL  kit  (RapIDTM  ONE  and  RapIDTM  NF  plus  sys- 
tems)  procedure.  All  the  VTEC  isolates  were  screened 
for  lack  of  β-glucuronidase  production,  which  is  con-

sidered  one  of  the  major  biochemical  markers  of  the 
serotype O157. 

DNA isolation and purification  
DNA  was  isolated  and  purified  from  all  the  obtained  
E. coli isolates (234 isolates) using a commercially avail-
able  kit  (Bio-Basic  LtD,  Ontario,  Canada).  Primarily, 
bacterial  isolates  and  reference  strains  were  cultivated 
in  10 ml  MacConkey  broth  and  incubated  at  37  °C  for 
12 h.  A  suspension  of  8  108  cells/ml  was  used  in  the 
DNA  isolation  processes.  The  quantity  of  the  isolated 
DNA  was  measured  by  DNA  spectrophotometry  (Bio-
chrom, London, U. K.) at a 260 nm wavelength. 

Multiplex PCR for detection of stx1, stx2, eae A  
and E-hly A 
Polymerase  chain  reaction  (using  MyCycler,  Bio-Rad, 
USA) was carried out for each sample in a total volume 
of  25 μl,  containing  1 μl  of  extracted  nucleic  acid  tem-
plates  (either  from  the  original  DNA  samples  (70 –  
100 ng/μl) or diluted samples 1 : 10, 1 : 20, 1 : 30 and 1 : 40) 
from both cultures and reference strains. In addition to 
DNA,  the  PCR  mixture  was  composed  of  2.5 μl  of  Taq 
reaction  buffer  (final  concentration  1 mM),  4 μl  of 
MgSO4 (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) (final concen-
tration  3.2 mM),  0.5 μl  of  deoxynucleoside  triphos-
phates (dNTPs) mixture (Bio-basic Ltd, Ontario, Canada) 
(final  concentration  50 μM)  and  0.2 μl  of  Taq  DNA  po-
lymerase  (Bio-basic  Ltd,  Ontario,  Canada)  (1U).  The 
primers used in this study and PCR conditions were as 
reported  by  Fagan  et  al.  1999  [22]  (see  Table 1).  Ten 
pmol from each of the primer templates were added to 
the PCR mixture mentioned above. 
  The PCR conditions consisted of an initial 95 °C dena-
turation  step  for  3  min  followed  by  35  cycles  of  95 °C 
for  20 sec  (denaturation  step),  58 °C  for  40 sec  (anneal-
ing  step),  and  72 °C  for  90 sec  (elongation  step).  The 
final  extension  cycle  was  followed  by  72 °C  incubation 
for  5 min.  Amplified  DNA  fragments  were  resolved  by 
gel  electrophoresis  (Labenet,  Taiwan)  using  2%  agarose

gels in Trisborate EDTA (TBE) buffer. Gels were stained 
with  0.5 μg  of  ethidium  bromide  per  ml.  The  running 
time  was  90 – 120 min  at  voltage  120 mV.  Finally,  gels 
were  visualized  and  photographed  by  UV  illuminator 
system (Alphainnotech, USA) [22]. For each gel, the first 
lane  was  specified  for  a  100 bp  DNA  ladder  (Bio-Basic, 
Canada), the second lane and the third lane were speci-
fied  for  positive  and  negative  control.  All  other  PCR 
reagents were purchased from Bio-Basic, Canada. 

Serotyping of the isolated VTEC 
Serotyping  for  the  O157,  O26,  and  O111  serotypes  of 
VTEC  that  were  characterized  by  mPCR  E.  coli  was  per-
formed  using  antibody-based  rapid  slide  agglutination 
assays (Denka-Seiken, Tokyo, Japan). 

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing 
The isolated bacteria were tested for their susceptibility 
to eight antimicrobials, as set by the National Commit-
tee for Clinical Laboratory standards, using a disc diffu-
sion  method  [23].  The  susceptibility  of  characterized 
isolates  to  the  most  commonly  used  antibiotics  in  the 
treatment of VTEC/EHEC infection in Jordan was tested. 
A  total  of  eight  antimicrobial  agents  were  included  
in  this  study.  The  concentration  (μg/disc)  of  the  used 
antibiotics  are:  Ampicillin  (AMP,  10),  co-trimoxazole 
(trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) 
1.25/23.75), 
ciprofloxacin  (CIP,  5),  gentamicin  (GEN,  10),  nalidixic 
acid  (NAL,  30),  nitrofurantoin  (NIT,  30),  tetracycline 
(TET,  30)  and  chloromphenicol  (CHL,  30).  All  antibio- 
tic  discs  were  purchased  from  SPAN  Diagnostic  Ltd,  
Udhna, India.

Results and discussion 

A  total  of  464  bacterial  isolates  were  recovered  from 
the sheep and goat faecal samples. From the 464 recov-
ered  bacteria,  287  (62%)  were  identified  as  E.  coli  iso-
lates  (Fig. 1).  By  the  conventional  method,  88  (30%)  of  
E. coli  isolates  were  suspected  as  O157  through  their 
phenotypical  characteristics  on  CSMAC  agar 
(non-
sorbitol  fermenters  forming;  colourless  colonies  on 
CSMAC  agar).  A  total  of  79  bacterial  isolates  were  re-
covered  from  slaughterhouses  and  butchers’  shops. 
Fifty  (64%)  of  the  79  isolates  were  identified  conven-
tionally as E. coli. 
 
In a total of 201 E. coli that were isolated from slaugh-
tered sheep (150) and goats (51), 18 (9%) were character-
ized  by  mPCR  as  having  one  or  more  of  the  virulence 
genes: stx1, stx2, E-hly A and eae A (Figs. 2 and 3). VTEC 
comprised  13  (72%)  of   the  total  number of the charac-

terized E. coli isolates (Table 2). VTEC was isolated from 
slaughtered sheep and goats with the same percentage 
(6%). VTEC was also isolated from slaughtered animals 
regardless  of  the  sources  of  those  animals,  that  is,  
either  local  or  imported  (Table 3).  Other  pathotypes  of 
E. coli  were  characterized  by  mPCR-like,  EPEC  (+eae  A) 
and  EHEC  (+hly  A)  in  a  total  of  two  (11%)  and  three 
(16%),  respectively,  from  the  total  number  of  virulent 
isolated E. coli (Table 2). 
 

  According  to  the  slide  agglutination  serotyping,  of 
the  13  suspected  VTEC  that  were  isolated,  one  be- 
longed  to  the  O157  serotype  and  another  belonged  to 
the  serotype  O26.  Both  O157  and  O26  have  the  geno-
type  stx1,  E-hly  A  and  eae.  The  rest  of  the  isolates  
were  serotypes  other  than  O157  or  O26.  All  the  VTEC 
isolates  were  screened  for  β-glucuronidase  production. 
Only  the  O157  isolate  lacked  the  β-glucuronidase  pro-
duction.

–  32.3%  [26],  16%  [27]  and  6.1%  [28]  –  which  is  in  ac-
cordance  with  our  result.  In  the  case  of  slaughtered 
animals, VTEC was isolated from sheep and goats with 
the  same  percentage  (about  6%)  (Table 2).  This  result 
demonstrates  that  both  sheep  and  goats  are  important 
reservoirs  of  VTEC,  as  has  been  suggested  [1].  Further-
more,  VTEC  isolates  comprised  21%  (7/33)  of  the  total  
E. coli  isolates  from  slaughterhouses  and  butchers’ 
shops  (Table 2).  None  of  the  seven  VTEC  isolates  from 
slaughterhouses  and  butchers’  shops  were  stereotyped 
as  O157,  O26  or  O111.  VTEC  contamination  in  slaugh-
ter  sites  is  related  to  poor  hygiene  and  non-activated 
sanitary measurements. 
  VTEC  isolated  either  from  slaughtered  animals, 
slaughterhouses or butchers’ shops possessed genes for 
E-hlyA  and/or  eaeA  in  65%  of  the  total  VTEC  isolates 
(Table 2).  This  type  of  VTEC  is  called  complex  VTEC. 
Complex  VTEC  is  more  commonly  recovered  from  the 
faeces of humans with HUS and HC than VTEC strains 
that do not possess these accessory virulence genes [29]. 
Complex  VTEC  possessing  the  E-hly  A  gene  has  been 
described as EHEC; the role of stx in EHEC pathogenesis 
in  ruminants  is  unclear  [30].  Contamination  of  slaugh-
terhouses with complex VTEC, regardless of the source 
of VTEC, and the high prevalence rate of complex VTEC 
in slaughtered sheep and goats will increase the rate of 
meat  contamination.  Consequently,  the  probability  of 
human  infection  with  complex  VTEC  will  increase. 
Epidemiological  and  comprehensive  studies  have  sug-
gested  that  the  level  of  contamination  with  complex 
VTEC is linked primarily to the level of intestinal infec-
tion,  the  faecal  excretion  of  these  pathogens  and  the 
general hygiene of slaughterhouses and butchers’ shops 
[31].  Thus,  routine  microbiologic  testing  performed  in 
slaughterhouses  and  butchers’  shops  can  be  beneficial 
in  terms  of  diminishing  food  contamination  before  it 
reaches consumers. 
  Among  the  isolated  VTEC,  only  one  isolate  had  the 
stx2  gene,  in  a  percentage  of  5%,  while  the  other  iso-
lates  genetically  had  the  stx1  gene  in  a  percentage  of

In  this  study,  VTEC  was  found  in  13  (6.5%)  of  the 
investigated  E.  coli  isolates  from  slaughtered  sheep  and 
goats (Tables 2 and 3). This supports the hypothesis that 
sheep  and  goats  are  important  reservoirs  of  VTEC.  A 
number  of  studies  have  demonstrated  that  animals, 
including  cows,  sheep  and  goats,  are  reservoirs  for  dif-
ferent  VTEC  strains  that  have  been  associated  with 
human  illness  [24, 25].   In  fact,   the  prevalence  rates  of 
VTEC in sheep and goats varied among different studies

95%. In contrast, a study that was performed in Austra-
lia suggested that 41 of 45 VTEC isolates produced stx1 
and  23  produced  stx2  [32].  In  fact,  a  study  was  con-
ducted  with  PCR  to  characterize  VTEC  containing  stx1 
and/or  stx2.  The  stx1  family  is  very  homogenous,  but 
stx2  is  a  more  heterogeneous  group  than  stx1  and  the 
stx2  variants  described  so  far  are  stx2,  stx2c,  stx2d,  stx2e 
and  stx2f  [33].  The  sources  of  the  slaughtered  animals 
revealed  that  VTEC  had  been  shedding  from  slaugh-
tered  sheep  and  goats,  regardless  of  their  source,  that 
is, either local or imported (Table 3). Thus, future inves-
tigation  into  VTEC  epidemiology  must  be  undertaken 
in small ruminants, regardless of the animals’ sources. 
We  found  that  90%  (9/10)  of  VTEC  isolated  from  the 
sheep  was  shed  from  the  young  (6 – 10  months)  rather 
than from old sheep. This result could be explained by 
a longitudinal study of VTEC in sheep which suggested 
that  the  prevalence  rate  of  VTEC  declines  with  an  in-
crease in age [29]. 
  Table 4  shows  the  results  of  antibiotic  sensitivity 
patterns  for  seven  virulent  patterns  of  E.  coli  isolates. 
The multiple antibiotic susceptibility (MAS) of different 
virulent patterns, stx1, stx1+stx2, stx1+eae A, stx1+E-hly A, 
stx1+ E-hly A+eae A, E-hly A and  eae  A, were 25%, 62.5%, 
25%, 37.5%, 37.5%, 62.5% and 25%, respectively. 
  Resistance  to  ampicillin  and  tetracycline  was  pre- 
sent  in  85%  of  the  VTEC  isolated  patterns,  while  the 
resistance  to  chloromphenicol,  nitrofurantoin  and 
nalidixic  acid  occurred  in  71%,  to  ciprofloxacin  in  
57%,  to  co-trimoxazole  in  28%  and  to  gentamicin  in 
14%.  It  is  worth  mentioning  that  ampicillin  and  tetra-
cycline  are  used  without  control  in  livestock,  which 
could in part  explain the  high  resistance  to these anti-
biotics. 
  We studied the effect of some antibiotics on the dif-
ferent  virulence  patterns  of  E. coli  isolates,  using  the 
antibiotics commonly used in the Jordanian market for 
treatment of EHEC/VTEC infection (Table 4). Obviously, 

the controlled use of antimicrobial agents is a prerequi-
site  to  limiting  the  emergence  of  drug-resistant  bacte-
ria, as recommended [23]. Previous studies have shown 
a  high  prevalence  of  antibiotic  resistance  among  some 
antibiotics, ampicillin and tetracycline [34, 35]. A study 
conducted  in  the  USA  about  antibiotic  resistance 
showed  that  most  E.  coli  isolates  were  susceptible  to  
(co-trimoxazole)  trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole,  gen-
tamicin  and  ciprofoloxacin  [36].  This  study  also  re-
vealed  that  VTEC  isolates  were  highly  susceptible  to 
gentamicin  and  co-trimoxazole,  with  moderate  sus- 
ceptibility  to  ciprofloxacin.  However,  VTEC  patterns 
showed resistance among some antibiotics tested, such 
as  tetracycline  and  ampicillin,  which  are  commonly 
used in Jordan (Table 4). In fact, the resistance ability of 
many  VTEC  patterns  is  related  to  the  transfer  of  plas-
mid-encoded  resistance  to  anti-microbial  agents.  The 
possibility  of  transfer  of  resistance  genes  between  bac-
teria  in  natural  habitats  has  recently  attracted  a  lot  of 
attention [37].
