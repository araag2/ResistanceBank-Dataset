We used phenotypic and 30 genotypic characterization techniques to describe the structure and the level of 31 antibioresistance of E. coli commensal populations and the resistant Enterobacteriaceae 32 carriage of sympatric African buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer) and cattle populations 33 characterized by their contact patterns in the southern part of Hwange ecosystem in 34 Zimbabwe. Our results 1) confirmed our assumption that buffalo and cattle share similar 35 phylogroup profiles, dominated by B1 (44.5%) and E (29.0%) phylogroups, with some 36 variability in A phylogroup presence (from 1.9 to 12%), 2) identified a significant gradient of 37 antibioresistance from isolated buffalo to buffalo in contact with cattle and cattle populations 38 expressed as the Murray score among Enterobacteriaceae (0.146, 0.258, 0.340, respectively) 39 and as the presence of tetracycline, trimethoprim and amoxicillin resistant subdominant E. 40 coli strains (0, 5.7 and 38%, respectively); 3) evidenced the dissemination of tetracycline, 41 trimethoprim and amoxicillin resistance genes (tet, dfrA, blaTEM-1in 26 isolated sub-dominant 42 E. coli strains between nearby buffalo and cattle populations that led us 4) to hypothesize the 43 role of the human/animal interface in the dissemination of genetic material from human to 44 cattle and towards wildlife. The study of antibiotic resistance dissemination in multi-host 45 systems and at anthropised/natural interface is necessary to better understand and mitigate its 46 multiple threats. These results also contribute to attempts aiming at using E. coli as a tool for 47 the identification of pathogen transmission pathway in multi-host systems. 48  49 INTRODUCTION 52  53  As human activities increase, the pressure on natural ecosystems through land 54 encroachment, unsustainable use of natural resources and fragmentation of habitats tend to 55 expand worldwide (1). This trend is exacerbated by human population growth and the need to 56 access more land to feed all in developing countries (2, 3). In these contexts, the spread of 57 pathogens and genetic material can represent a burden on wildlife, livestock and human 58 population health (4-6). Diseases significantly impact livestock productions, which are a key 59 livelihood option in semi-arid areas, and can also threaten endangered wildlife species (7). 60 The dissemination of antibiotic resistance (ABR) into remote, supposedly pristine, areas 61 resulting from a high and inappropriate use of antibiotics in humans and domestic animals (in 62 particular medicated feed) (8, 9), demonstrates how the most remote ecosystems are not 63 exempt of a human footprint (10). The consequences of ABR diffusion in natural ecosystems 64 are largely unknown. However, the evolution and selection of resistance genes in the wild 65 could compromise the use of antibiotics (11), the main tool to fight infectious diseases in 66 domestic animals and human (10). Moreover, the ABR pollution “in the wild” could threaten 67 biodiversity (12). 68  The dynamics and processes of microorganism transmission between hosts and the 69 environment should therefore be a focus of research at wildlife/livestock/human interfaces to 70 provide management options to reduce or deal with their negative effects (i.e. impact on 71 human health, livestock production and biodiversity conservation). These interfaces represent 72 complex multi-host and multi-pathogen systems that have been so far little studied (13). Even 73 if focusing on a single pathogen, the large diversity of hosts constrains the efficiency of past 74 and current surveillance and control approaches. New frameworks are therefore needed 75 bridging biological fields (14, 15). As pathogens have a limited number of transmission 76 modes to infect a new host (e.g. direct, environmental such as water-borne, foodborne or 77  4vector/insect-borne transmission), a framework trying to identify the transmission processes 78 linking one host to different sources of pathogens could help identifying hotspots of pathogen 79 transmission and predicting future microorganism transmission at a local level (16, 17). 80  The bacteria Escherichia coli is a good indicator of transmission pathways within multi-81 host systems because E. coli is ubiquitous, shares the same niche as enteric pathogens and 82 transferred by the same route and one of the best-studied and known bacteria. E. coli diversity 83 and population dynamics have been the focus of recent studies (17-20) investigating the 84 relationship between E. coli populations and proxies of inter-host contacts. For example, E. 85 coli sharing between human, primates and livestock increased with the frequency and 86 intensity of inter-species contacts in Uganda (21). However, more studies are needed with 87 different animal models, in different ecosystems and using the new available molecular tools 88 to characterize bacterial diversity. The dissemination of ABR in pristine ecosystems can also 89 be used to track directional genetic transfer from human and livestock towards wildlife (10, 90 22, 23). 91  A wealth of studies exists on the host, temporal stability and geographical structure of 92 E. coli associated with humans and domestic animals (e.g.(24-26). The factors contributing to 93 the sharing of E. coli between host populations are: 1) feeding modes; 2) phylogenetic 94 relatedness and 3) host contact patterns related to bacterial transmission (27). As it can be 95 difficult to weigh each factor against each other, estimating the proportion of E. coli 96 population similarity related to the last factor could be difficult. However, a recent study (28) 97 provided a semi-experimental set-up that we used here. The animal model offers a good 98 opportunity to investigate E. coli population sharing between hosts as the African buffalo 99 (Syncerus caffer caffer) and cattle (Bos taurus/indicus) are bovids and therefore 100 phylogenetically related, their diets overlap substantially and telemetry studies indicate that 101 both populations can come into contact (28). Finally, ungulate population movements can be 102  5used to detect the degree of contacts between populations defining a contact variable that can 103 be used to test hypotheses on E. coli population sharing.  104  The study was therefore initiated with a double objective: first to increase the 105 knowledge on the dissemination of ABR genes between hosts in these complex systems, so 106 far little studied, in order to assess the risk associated with this anthropological threat on 107 natural ecosystems; secondly, to explore the processes of E. coli transmission between hosts 108 as a model for pathogen transmission and potentially as a predictive tool. Hence, the genetic 109 structure of commensal E. coli population and their ABR were explored simultaneously in 110 sympatric ungulate hosts. We hypothesized that 1) the phylogenetic proximity and the diet 111 overlap between cattle and buffalo in our study site would result in similar E. coli 112 phylogroups’ profiles but that 2) ABR in buffalos should increase with the level of habitat 113 sharing with domestic hosts, as the use of antibiotics is restricted to human and domestic 114 populations. 115  116 MATERIALS AND METHODS 117  Study site and experimental setting. The study was conducted in the Hwange district 118 of Zimbabwe, Africa. The Hwange National Park (HNP) and its periphery (including the 119 Sikumi Forest and surrounding communal lands) are part of the Kavango-Zambezi 120 Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA TFCA) (28) (Figure 1). In southern Africa, TFCAs 121 aim at combining sustainable development and biodiversity conservation through the 122 promotion of the sustainable use of natural resources and agricultural production (29). The 123 livelihoods of small-scale farmers rely heavily on basic livestock production (herd average 124 n=5), little or no agricultural input (fertilizer, antibiotic feeds) (28) and maize and sorghum 125 cropping in a semi-arid ecosystem (average rainfall 600mm per year). 126  The telemetry protocol presented in (28) targeting sympatric buffalo and cattle 127  6populations was carried out on the same ungulate populations as of December 2012. Adult 128 females were equipped with GPS collars as their movements are representative of the herd 129 movements (30, 31). Annual home ranges for each individual/herd were calculated using the 130 95% Utilization Distribution method (32) and are displayed in Figure 1. E. coli sampling 131 protocols were implemented in 3 populations identified using the telemetry results: a distant 132 buffalo population (A) whose home range does not overlap with the other two populations 133 (population size estimated around 1000 individuals); a neighboring buffalo population (B) 134 (population size estimated also around 500 individuals) and a cattle population (C) (several 135 hundred individuals) sharing Sikumi Forest. 136  In this area, interviews with animal health technicians, farmers and human health 137 professionals revealed that antibiotics were used in cattle populations to treat tick-borne 138 diseases and other infections (they were asked to list by order of importance the antibiotic 139 they use or prescribe). The antibiotics used most frequently in cattle were mainly tetracycline, 140 followed by oxytetracycline, penicillin and streptomycin (principally injected intra-141 muscularly). There does not appear to be any preventive use of antibiotics in the area in cattle. 142 In human, antibiotics were mainly used to treat human tuberculosis (Mycobacterium 143 tuberculosis), an infection with a high prevalence in the area (especially due to the high HIV 144 burden). The main antibiotics used in humans were trimethoprim, cotrimoxazole (a 145 combination of trimethoprim and sulphonamids), amoxicillin and doxycycline.  146  Sample collection. Fresh fecal samples of animals from the three populations A, B and 147 C were collected on the ground a few seconds or minutes after deposition between October 148 31st and November 04th 2012. For cattle, the protocol was implemented in two villages (i.e. 149 Magoli and Jwapi), following cattle herds returning from their daily roaming in the Sikumi 150 forest to the kraal (i.e. overnight enclosure located close to homestead) before sunset. For 151 buffalo populations (A and B), the herd was located using recent GPS positions transmitted 152  7by satellite and very high frequency devices. After visual contact was established with the 153 buffalo herd, movements were monitored, and the samples were collected just after the herd 154 moved out of an open area. This protocol ensured that the fecal material collected was 155 obtained from the right host (population A, B or C) and endeavored to minimize the sampling 156 of fecal material from the same individuals by selecting distant dungs (more than 10 meters) 157 or dungs with clear dissimilarities in color and/or density. The sample size of around 50 (5% 158 or 10%) was estimated from the population size (500 heads for each buffalo populations and 159 several hundred heads for the cattle population) and practically to minimize double sampling 160 of individuals and taking into account laboratory time and costs. Labeled with unique 161 identifying numbers, transport swabs (Clinical Sciences Diagnostics containing Amies 162 transport medium) were immersed in the fecal material and transported in a cool box with ice 163 packs from the field to a deep freezer (in less than 6h) in the research camp where they were 164 then maintained at -20°C. During the same week, they were transported by car to Harare, 165 capital of Zimbabwe, without de-freezing and stored in another deep freezer until shipment by 166 plane to the INSERM laboratory in France in March 2013. Once in the laboratory, each swab 167 was then discharged in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth with 20% glycerol and stored at -168 80°C until used. 169  Isolation of the dominant E. coli clone. The stool-containing suspensions were 170 plated onto Drigalski agar plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. Then, one yellow colony 171 was randomly picked and confirmed by MALDI-TOF (MALDI Biotyper Microflex, Bruker) 172 to belong to the E. coli/Escherichia clade species. This colony was considered to represent the 173 dominant E. coli/Escherichia clade clone as it has been recently shown (33, 34). The strain 174 was tested for antibiotic susceptibility, phylotyped, and stored at -80°C. The used 175 nomenclature for the designation of these strains was as follow: the letter of the population, 176 the number of the individual and “DOM” for dominant (e.g. B24DOM). 177  8 Antibiotic resistance. Two protocols were used to analyze ABR. First, global ABR was 178 analyzed in each sample by plating 100 μl of the glycerol dilution on Drigalski agar on which 179 antibiotics disks containing amoxicillin (25μg), kanamycin (30UI), streptomycin (10UI), 180 tetracycline (30UI), trimethoprim (5μg), sulphonamids (200μg) and chloramphenicol (30μg) 181 were plated, as described (35). Plates were incubated 24h at 37°C and if colonies were present 182 within the zone of inhibition (as defined by the French Society for Microbiology, www.sfm-183 microbiologie.org/) the sample was reported to be carrying resistant Enterobacteriaceae. A 184 Murray score was calculated as in (36) by the following equation : Murray score = (total 185 number of resistance per total number of possible resistances for each individual sample). In 186 addition, one randomly selected yellow colony falling within the zone of inhibition of 187 tetracycline, amoxicillin and trimethoprim was purified on Mueller-Hinton medium with the 188 corresponding antibiotic disk each time it was present. The E. coli/Escherichia clade 189 identification was confirmed by MALDI-TOF and stored at -80°C. Those strains were then 190 called tetracycline, amoxicillin and trimethoprim resistant strains, respectively, and labeled by 191 the letter of the population, the number of the individual and the abbreviation of the antibiotic 192 (e.g.  B24TET).  193  Secondly, classical antibiotic susceptibilities were determined using the disk diffusion 194 method according to the 2012 recommendations of the French Society for Microbiology on 195 the dominant and on the tetracycline, amoxicillin and trimethoprim resistant (see above) E. 196 coli strains. The following antimicrobial agents were tested:amoxicillin (25μg), amoxicillin + 197 clavulanic acid (20+10μg), ticarcillin (75μg), cefoxitin (30μg), cefepime (30μg), cefotaxime 198 (30μg), ceftazidime (30μg), streptomycin (10UI), gentamicin (10UI), kanamycin (30UI), 199 tetracycline (30UI), trimethoprim (5μg), sulfonamids (200μg), chloramphenicol (30μg), 200 nalidixic acid (30μg) and ofloxacin (5μg).  201  Further characterization was performed on the subdominant antibiotic resistant strains. 202  9Detection of tetracycline resistance efflux pumps - encoding genes [tet(A) to tet(E)] using a 203 multiplex PCR (37) was performed on the tetracycline resistant E. coli strains. Beta-lactamase 204 encoding gene blaTEM was screened by PCR (38) followed by Sanger sequencing on the 205 amoxicillin resistant E. coli strains. Multiplex PCR detection of dihydrofolate reductase 206 encoding genes dfrA1, dfrA5/14, dfrA7/17 and dfrA12 was performed, followed by Sanger 207 sequencing, on the trimethoprim resistant E. coli strains. The choice of these genes was based 208 on their prevalence in the E. coli genome database Mage 209 (http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/microscope/home/)(39). The primers for the dfrA 210 PCR and the length of the PCR products were as follow: dhfr1.f 211 AACCAATGGCTGTTGGTTGG, dhfr1.r CTGAAACAATGACATGATCCG, 180bp; 212 dhfr5.f CCACCAGACACTATAACGTG, dhfr5.r CATACCCTGGTCCGCGAAAG, 237 bp; 213 dhfr7.f TCAGAAAATGGCGTAATCGG, dhfr7.r ACGTGAACAGTAGACAAATG, 332bp; 214 dhfr12.f TGAGACAAGCTCGAATTCTG, dhfr12.r TGAACTCGGAATCAGTACGC, 430 215 bp. The PCR conditions were as in (40). The differentiation between dfrA5 and dfrA14 genes 216 on one hand, and dfrA7 and dfrA17 genes on the other hand, was performed by sequencing. 217  E. coli phylogenetic grouping and strain relatedness. Dominant and subdominant 218 tetracycline, amoxicillin and trimethoprim resistant E. coli strains were assigned to one of the 219 7 main phylogenetic phylogroups (A, B1, B2, C, D, E, F) using the new Clermont quadruplex 220 method (40) or to one of the five Escherichia clades (I to V) as in (40, 41). The subdominant 221 tetracycline resistant E. coli strain relatedness was assessed by repetitive extragenic 222 palindromic PCR (rep-PCR) using a DiversiLab strain typing system (bioMérieux) as in (42). 223 Relatedness among the strains was also assessed by random amplification of polymorphic 224 DNA (RAPD) using the 1254 primer (5’-CCGCAGCCAA-3’) as in (43). 225  Statistical analyses. Using the R software (44), after checking for homogeneity of 226 variance (no distribution was normally distributed), non parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis, 227  10Wilcoxon, Chi-square and Spearman rank correlation tests) were implemented to compare the 228 ABR and the phylogroup population structure between the three host populations.  229  230 RESULTS 231  We collected samples from 53 isolated wild buffalo (population A), 52 from 232 neighboring wild buffalo (B) and 50 samples were collected from domestic cattle (C).  233  Phylogenetic group distribution and antibioresistance of the dominant E. 234 coli/Escherichia clade strain. E. coli/Escherichia clade dominant strains were detected in 235 152 out of 155 samples [n=52 for buffalo (A), n=50 for neighboring  buffalo (B) and n=50 for 236 cattle (C)]. For three samples, the dominant Enterobacteriaceae did not belong to the 237 Escherichia genus (two Klebsiella oxytoca in the B population and one Enterobacter cloacae 238 in the A population). 239  The three host populations had similar patterns of E. coli phylogenetic group 240 distribution (A-B: Spearman p=0.96, A-C Spearman p= 0.81, B-C Spearman p= 0.77) (Figure 241 2). B1 was the main phylogroup detected in those three populations (36-54% of the detected 242 dominant strains) followed by the phylogroup E (24-34%). D phylogroup strains were present 243 at more than 10% in population A. A, B2 and C phylogroups were rarely detected (less than 244 6%). Three Escherichia clade I strains were isolated, all in buffalo (2 in A population and 1 in 245 B population). No phylogroup F strain was observed. 246  ABR was found very rarely in the dominant strains, as only one B1-phylogroup E. coli 247 from the buffalo population at the interface with cattle (B24DOM) was resistant streptomycin, 248 tetracycline and sulphonamides. 249  Global antibiotic resistance of fecal Enterobacteriaceae. To have an overview of 250 ABR in Enterobacteriaceae, the 155 fecal samples were tested for antibiotic resistant 251 Enterobacteriaceae by direct plating, gathering by this approach both dominant and 252  11subdominant strains (Table 1). A significant difference between the ABR patterns of the three 253 populations was observed (Kruskal-Wallis Test p<0.01) (Table 1). Buffalo with no contact 254 with cattle (population A, average Murray score = 0.146) presented a lower Murray score than 255 buffalo at the interface (population B, average Murray score = 0.258) (Wilcoxon test: p<0.01) 256 and cattle (population C, average Murray score = 0.340) (Wilcoxon test: p<0.01). Cattle did 257 not exhibit a significantly higher resistant score than buffalo at the interface (B) (Wilcoxon 258 test: p=0.21). Trends by antibiotics were quite consistent: for 4 antibiotics out of 7 259 (tetracycline, trimethoprim, sulphonamid, chloramphenicol), we observed an increasing 260 antibiotic resistance along the gradient A<B<C; for 2 out 7 (streptomycin, amoxicillin), we 261 observed A<<C<B and for the remaining one, kanamycin, A=B<C. Specifically, tetracycline 262 resistance was significantly different between A and C (Chi-square test; p<0.01), A and B 263 (Chi-square test; p=0.04) and between B and C (Chi-square test; p<0.05). Amoxicillin 264 resistance was significantly different between A and C (Chi-square test; p<0.01), A and B 265 (Chi-square test; p<0.01) and between B and C (Chi-square test; p<0.01). Trimethoprim 266 resistance was significantly different between A and C (Chi-square test; p<0.01), not 267 significant between A and B (Chi-square test; p=0.61) and between B and C (Chi-square test; 268 p<0.01). In addition, buffalo (A and B, Murray score=0.201) had significantly less ABR than 269 cattle (C) (Wilcoxon test: p<0.01) and populations in contact (B and C, Murray score=0.298) 270 had significantly more resistance than isolated population (A) (Wilcoxon test: p<0.01). 271  E. coli subdominant antibiotic resistant strains. Due to the veterinary and human 272 medicine practices in Zimbabwe, we characterized further the presence of E. coli 273 subdominant strains resistant to tetracycline, which was the most commonly used antibiotic in 274 cattle, as well as resistance to amoxicillin and trimethoprim, which were largely used in 275 human. Furthermore, a very contrasted pattern of tetracycline resistant Enterobacteriaceae, 276 and at a lesser extend of amoxicillin and trimethoprim resistance, among host populations 277  12were observed (Table 1). No antibiotic resistant E. coli strain was identified in the population 278 A (buffalo with no contact with cattle) whereas 3 and 19 fecal samples yielded resistant E. 279 coli strains in populations B (buffalo in contact with cattle) and C (cattle), respectively 280 (significant difference between C and the two other populations; Chi-square test; p<0.01 for C 281 and A; C and B) (Table 2). Using our strategy, we sometimes isolated several strains that 282 were resistant to two or three of the tested antibiotics in a single sample. We considered that 283 the strains were identical when they belonged to the same phylogroup, exhibited the same 284 pattern of antibiotic resistance on the antibiogram, possessed the same resistance gene and 285 shared an identical RAPD profile. Thus, 3 and 23 subdominant resistant strains were 286 identified in populations B and C, respectively (significant difference between C and the two 287 other populations; Chi-square test; p<0.01 for C and A; C and B) (Table 2). Of note, the 288 subdominant resistant strain isolated in the B24 sample (B24TET) was identical to the 289 dominant strain resistant to antibiotics (B24DOM), as confirmed by RAPD analysis. 290  In the isolated resistant strains, a high diversity of E. coli phylogenetic groups was 291 observed with 5 phylogroups represented (Table 2). To document this heterogeneity further, 292 we performed rep-PCR on the most frequently isolated subdominant tetracycline resistant 293 strains (Figure 3). Only three B1 phylogroup strains from the cattle population (C12TET, 294 C26TET, C29TET) belong to the same clone. For the remaining strains, the rep-PCR did not 295 reveal any identical strain between the buffalos at the interface and the cattle subdominant 296 tetracycline resistant strain population. Similarly, B1 phylogroup strains C2TMP, C38TMP and 297 C42TMP gave all a RAPD clear distinct pattern. Of note, in the cattle population, the main 298 phylogroups of the resistant subdominant strains were the A and B1 phylogroups (39.1% 299 each) followed by the C phylogroup (13%), contrary to the B1 and E phylogroups for the 300 dominant strains (Figure 2). 301  The antibioresistant strains were very rarely resistant to only one antibiotic (two strains 302  13resistant only to tetracycline) but were resistant to up to 8 of the tested antibiotics. The most 303 common ABR was the tetracycline and sulphonamid resistance (21 strains, 80.7% of (all) the 304 resistant strains) followed by trimethoprim (18 strains, 69.2%), amoxicillin/ticarcillin (16 305 strains, 61.5%) and streptomycin (13 strains, 50.0%) resistances (Table 2). Six strains were 306 resistant to the association amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and one to kanamycin. A multiplex 307 PCR assay of tetA to tetE genes responsible of tetracycline resistance (37) identified a tet gene 308 in all the tetracycline resistant strains (Table 2). The genes were mainly tetA and tetB and 309 found in both buffalo and cattle populations. Only one cattle strain had tetC. A multiplex PCR 310 assay of the dfr genes involved in trimethoprim resistance identified a majority of dfrA14 311 genes but some dfrA1, dfrA5, dfrA7 and dfrA17 genes, the dfrA5 and dfrA7 genes being 312 shared between buffalo and cattle populations. Lastly, we confirmed by PCR-sequencing that 313 the amoxicillin resistance found in both populations was due to narrow-spectrum beta-314 lactamase TEM-1 (Table 2). 315  Altogether, these data indicate that diverse E. coli strains bearing antibioresistance 316 genes (tet, dfrA and blaTEM-1) are present in buffalo in contact with cattle and especially in 317 cattle, but not in buffalo without contact with cattle. 318  319 Discussion 320  We explored the structure and the level of antibioresistance of E. coli commensal 321 populations and the resistant Enterobacteriaceae carriage of sympatric buffalo and cattle 322 populations characterized by their contact patterns in a southern African ecosystem. Our 323 results 1) identify an ABR gradient that we genetically characterized from cattle to buffalo, 324 structured by host phylogeny and contact patterns, 2) confirm our initial assumptions that 325 buffalo and cattle shared similar phylogroup profiles, albeit with some variability that led us 326 3) to hypothesize the role of the human/animal interface in the diffusion of genetic material 327  14from human to cattle and finally towards wildlife. 328  The main result of this study is the identification of an ABR gradient between sympatric 329 domestic and wild ungulate populations in a tropical ecosystem. We detected this gradient at 330 several levels. First, at the Enterobacteriaceae community level, the Murray score indicated 331 that the cattle population had significantly more ABR than buffalo and that ungulate 332 populations in contact (i.e. population B and C with overlapping home ranges) shared more 333 ABR than ungulate populations that were not in contact (population A) (Table 1, Figure 1). 334 Secondly, whereas almost no ABR was detected in dominant E. coli strains isolated from the 335 3 host populations, subdominant antibiotic resistant E. coli strains were mainly present in 336 cattle and, at a lower isolation ratio in the buffalo population in contact with the cattle 337 population, whereas antibiotic resistant E. coli strains were absent from the buffalo population 338 that had no contact with the 2 other populations (Table 2). Finally, the molecular 339 characterization of ABR associated with the observed various genetic backgrounds in the 340 subdominant resistant E. coli strains found in populations B and C suggested that these strains 341 rarely spread between individuals, contrary to the antibioresistance genes which are shared 342 within the cattle population as well as between buffalo and cattle at the interface. It can be 343 hypothesized that strains can be transmitted at the interface rapidly, but that antibioresistance 344 genes spread independently. This is facilitated by the fact that these genes are borne by 345 mobile genetic structures. In E. coli, tet efflux genes are found in transposons inserted into 346 diverse plasmids from a variety of incompatibility groups (45) and blaTEM-1 has been observed 347 to disseminate on the Tn3 transposon (46). Similarly, dfr genes are often integron-borne genes 348 (47). In those subdominant resistant strains,  multiple resistance was observed (Table 2) 349 which is mainly conferred by mobile genetic elements. Such a mechanism of selfish gene 350 spread rather than strain or plasmid spread has recently been proposed to explain the 351 dissemination of acquired resistance to ß-lactams in small wild mammals in French Guiana 352  15pristine forest from an Amerindian village (48). 353  ABR in natural ecosystems can originate from two sources: 1) natural ABR emerging in 354 the wild through natural selection processes; or 2) diffusion of genetic material or organisms 355 harboring these ABR from an anthropological origin, i.e. through the use of antibiotics in 356 domestic animals or in humans and their subsequent diffusion in the environment (10). We 357 are confident that the gradient identified originated from the latter process, because the main 358 ABR detected in the buffalo population matched the most frequently used antibiotics in 359 domestic animal and human populations (tetracycline and streptomtycin for domestic animal 360 and trimethoprim and amoxicillin for humans); because ABR in cattle was also detected for 361 antibiotics used in human populations; and because the resistance genes identified here have 362 already been isolated in many different contexts, and their emergence is supposed to be a rare 363 event. In addition, the buffalo population in contact with cattle had an intermediate degree of 364 ABR both at the global and subdominant antibiotic resistant E. coli strains, and all ABR 365 found in wildlife was also found in cattle. The dominant clone is usually the clone with the 366 best fitness in a given environment. Many drug resistances confer a fitness cost (49), and it is 367 likely that antibiotic resistant bacteria will be outcompeted in a low antibiotic pressure 368 environment, such as protected areas. In this case, resistant clones will probably not be 369 selected as dominant. However, several processes act to stabilize resistance (compensatory 370 evolution) (50), and there is also evidence that the genetic adaptations to the costs of 371 resistance can virtually preclude resistant E. coli lineages from reverting to sensitivity (51). 372 This could explain that only one buffalo in contact with cattle has a dominant strain resistant 373 to antibiotics (B24) (Table 2). Our data are in line with a worldwide study of commensal E. 374 coli in wild and domestic animals that showed the anthropogenic origin of antibiotic 375 resistance and integron, a molecular vector of resistance (8).  376  The profiles of E. coli populations between the three host populations shared a degree of 377  16similarity. The phylogenetic proximity of ungulate hosts and the fact that they seasonally use 378 food and water resources in the same ecosystem (no supplementary feeding for cattle except 379 for crop residues left in the fields in the study area) can explain these results. The dominant 380 phylogroup for the three ungulate populations was B1, followed by phylogroup E (Figure 2), 381 in agreement with available knowledge for ruminant populations (52). However, the third 382 phylogroup prevalence differed between populations A, B and C. In cattle, the third most 383 prevalent phylogroup was A, a dominant phylogroup for human populations (33), suggesting 384 a transfer of strains between human and cattle that interact through frequent and close 385 contacts (8). In buffalo, the third most prevalent phylogroups were D and B2 respectively for 386 populations A and B, indicating that different subdominant phylogroup dominate in different 387 populations of the same species, as suggested for humans (52). Interestingly, the subdominant 388 resistant strains of the cattle population were mainly of phylogroup A (9/26) with only two 389 strains of phylogroup E, as opposed to the dominant clones, suggesting also a transfer of 390 human origin (52). However, this result was not observed in the buffalo populations, from 391 which only 3 strains were isolated (Table 2). 392  Although the mechanisms of genetic material transfer are not known, we demonstrate 393 that the level of ABR varies according to the contact patterns between host populations. 394 Sharing pasture and water points offers opportunities for direct and indirect transfer of 395 organisms or genetic materials between wild and domestic ungulates. Close contacts between 396 human and cattle occur regularly, especially when cattle are kept in the kraal every evening, 397 where lactating female are milked, and the herders manipulate animals. Often, human and 398 livestock share a unique water source. These behaviors can explain the presence of 399 phylogroups of potential human origin (i.e. phylogroup A) and ABR against human 400 antibiotics. It has been recently shown in the Amazonian forest that acquired ABR did not 401 disseminate in the wild far (600 meters) from the point of selective pressure represented by 402  17the village (48). 403  These results are important at two levels. First, they provide some information on the 404 dissemination of bacteria and their resistance at wild/domestic/human interfaces, indicating 405 that wildlife populations within protected conservation area are not exempt from 406 anthropological pollution, even in the most remote areas. The impacts of E. coli (and 407 potentially other bacteria) and resistance genes transfers to wild populations are difficult to 408 assess, but they could alter the microbiome structures in wildlife and affect their behavior 409 and/or health (53, 54). This dissemination can also pose a threat to the domestic and human 410 populations from which they originate, as resistance genes in different selective environments 411 can evolve into more harmful variants when they are introduced back into domestic or human 412 populations (55). Follow-up studies on the mechanisms of bacteria and gene diffusion in this 413 ecosystem could be targeted at describing the human E. coli population structure and ABR 414 and the role of other domestic and wild hosts and the environment. 415  Second, these results support the potential use of E. coli as an indicator of transmission 416 pathways in multi-host systems as recently suggested (17). Dominant strains are shared 417 between hosts in contact (e.g. phylogroup B1 and E between cattle and buffalo; potentially A 418 between human and cattle) and offer a first level of variability to be used to assess 419 transmission processes between hosts. If resistant sub-dominant strains were not shared 420 between in-contact host populations, their ABR genes were, identifying a second level of 421 exploitable variability and a directional transmission pathway from cattle to buffalo, with 422 humans as the probable source population. The intensity, frequency and directionality of these 423 transmission events between hosts could be further investigated using new next generation 424 sequencing tools targeting specific genetic sequences and applied to time series of multi-host 425 sampling coupled with studies estimating proxies of inter-host contacts. For example, Miguel 426 et al. (28) indicated seasonal and inter-annual inter-host contact patterns that could translate 427  18into pulses of ABR dissemination. The outcome would be a framework to identify 428 "highways" of transmission between hosts, with potential spatial and temporal variability, 429 giving a head-start to the surveillance of emerging disease spillover events. 430  431 Funding information 432 We would like to thank the ANR SAVARID (ANR-11-CEPL-003) project for supporting this 433 study. 434 Acknowledgments 435 This study was implemented within the framework of the research Platform "Conservation 436 and Production in Partnership" (www.rp-pcp.org) and in collaboration with CNRS within the 437 framework of the "Zone Atelier" in Hwange area. 438  439   440  19Table 1: Global antibiotic resistance prevalence of fecal Enterobacteriaceae for each 441 ungulate population 442  Host population A1 n=53 Host population Bn=52 Host population C n=50 Antibiotic    Streptomycin  2 (3.8)2 9 (17.3) 8 (16.0) Tetracycline  0 4 (7.7) 17 (34.0) Amoxicillin  20 (37.7) 45 (86.5) 34 (68.0) Trimethoprim  9 (17.0) 11 (21.2) 23 (46.0)  Sulphonamid  20 (37.7) 20 (38.5) 25 (50.0) Kanamycin  2 (3.8) 2 (3.8) 5 (10.0) Chloramphenicol  1 (1.9) 3 (5.8) 7 (14.0) Murray resistance score3  (mean and confidence interval)  0.146 (± 0.150) 0.258 (± 0.204) 0.340 (± 0.275) 1 A = Buffalo population not in contact; B = buffalo population in contact with cattle; C = 443 cattle population. 444 2 For each antibiotic, the first number represents the number of resistant samples and the 445 second, the related percentage for the given host population. 446 3 The Murray score was calculated for all antibiotics as in Murray et al.
