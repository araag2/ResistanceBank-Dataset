Salmonella  is  a  globally  widespread  food-borne  pathogen  having  major  impact  on  public  health. 
Salmonellosis  is  an  infection  with  bacteria  called  Salmonella.  Most  persons  infected  with  Salmonella 
develop  diarrhea,  fever,  and  abdominal  cramps  12  to  72  h  after  infection.  This  study  was  designed  to 
isolate  and  identify  Salmonella  spp.  from  cloacal  swabs  of  apparently  healthy  broiler  chickens  in 
Bangladesh. Salmonella  was characterized  culturally, biochemically and also via PCR method.  Among 
50 isolates, 16 were found to be positive for Salmonella. PCR using 16S rRNA gene primers produced a 
496 bp band indicating positive result for Salmonella spp. Antibiotic sensitivity test using six commonly 
used  antibiotics  in  Bangladesh  named  colistin  sulphate,  erythromycin,  cloxacillin,  ciprofloxacin, 
neomycin  and  amoxicillin  demonstrated  that  5  (31.25%)  strains  were  resistant  towards  ciprofloxacin. 
Fourteen (87.5%) isolates were resistant to amoxicillin, while fourteen (87.5%) were found intermediate 
towards neomycin. The study revealed that, healthy broiler chicken sold at local markets of Bangladesh 
transmit drug resistant Salmonella to the environment, therefore, use of antibiotics can be monitored in 
food  producing  animals  since  drug  resistance  could  be  a  major  public  health  problem  in  developing 
countries like Bangladesh. 

INTRODUCTION 
 
Salmonella  is  considered  the  most  important  food-borne 
bacterial pathogen in the world (Foley et al., 2011), this is 
a  Gram  negative,  short  rod-shaped,  non-spore  forming, 
non-capsulated,  facultative  anaerobic  bacterium  (OIE, 
2006).  The  reasonably  surveillance  for  Salmonella  is  to

reduce  human  Salmonellosis  of  poultry  origin  across  the 
world  (Keery,  2010).  Salmonella  is  grouped  into  three 
main classes based on their association with human and 
animal  hosts.  The  first  group  is  specific  for  human  host, 
the  second  consists  of  serotypes  which  are  adapted  to

specific  animal  hosts  and  the  third  consists  of  serotypes 
causing  diseases  in  human  and  a  variety  of  animal 
species.  Salmonella  infection  causes  several  clinical 
conditions  those  are  harmful  to  human  such  as:  enteric 
fever,  enterocolitis  and  systemic  infections  (Piyush  and 
Anju,  2008).  The  most  common  source  of  human 
Salmonellosis  is  food  of  poultry  origin  since  poultry  are 
the  most  crucial  reservoirs  of  Salmonella.  Poultry  and 
poultry products are often involved in sporadic cases and 
in  outbreaks  of  human  Salmonellosis  (Humphrey,  2000).  
As Salmonella is a pathogen resides in the gut of poultry, 
there  is  scope  of  transmission  of  Salmonella  infection 
from  poultry  to  human  through  food  chain.  Cross-
contamination 
scalding, 
defeathering,  evisceration  and  giblet  operations  (Bryan 
and  Doyle,  1995).  The  Salmonella  spreading  with  the 
presence  of  antimicrobial  resistance  genes  have  some 
global  public  health  impacts,  because  of  their  trans-
mission  to  other  countries,  by  travelers  or  by  trade  are 
impossible 
(Collard  et  al.,  2007)  but 
differences  in  hygiene  practices  and  handling  between 
slaughterhouses,  could  significantly  eliminate  the  risk  of 
Salmonella  contamination  of  broiler  meat  (Heyndrickx  et 
al.,  2002).  In  developed  countries  it  is  becoming  more 
and more accepted that a majority of resistant strains are 
of  zoonotic  origin and  have gained their  resistance in an 
animal  host  before  being  moved  to  humans  through  the 
food  chain  (Molbak  et  al.,  2002;  Threlfall  et  al.,  2002). 
This  resistance  occurs  due  to  the  indiscriminate  and 
improper  use  of  sub-therapeutic  doses  of  antibiotics. 
Present  study  was 
to  characterize 
Salmonella  spp.  as  well  as  determination  of  prevalence 
and  antibiogram  analysis  in  apparently  healthy  chickens 
sold  directly  to  the  consumers.  Thus,  it  is  inevitably  of 
great importance for both animal and public health.  
 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Collection and transportation of samples 
 
A  total  of  50  samples  were  collected  from  cloaca  of  commercial 
broiler  from  local  market,  at  Mymensingh  region  of  Bangladesh 
during the study period  of January to June  2014. The swabs were 
collected in nutrient broth and brought to Bacteriology Laboratory of 
the  Department  of  Microbiology  and  Hygiene,  Bangladesh 
Agricultural University (BAU), Mymensingh. The samples were used 
to  isolate,  identify  and  characterize  the  salmonella  by  cultural, 
biochemical and molecular methods. 
 
 
Isolation of Salmonella   
 
The  samples  were  cultured  into  SS  agar  (Figure  2).  An  amount  of 
100  µL  nutrient  broth  from  test  tube  were  inoculated  into  SS  agar 
and  incubated  at  35°C  for  24  h.  Characteristics  salmonella  colony 
were  sub  cultured  into  SS  agar.  Suspected  colony  was  selected 
and  performed  gram  staining.  Isolates  with  supporting  growth 
characteristics  of  Salmonella  were  subjected 
to  3  standard 
biochemical  tests,  indole  (I),  methyl  red  (MR),  Voges-Proskauer 
(VP). Methyl  red  (MR) test  was performed by inoculating a single 
 
 

thus  designed 

 
 
 
 
colony  of  the  test  organism  into  0.5  ml  sterile  glucose  phosphate 
broth.  The  motility  test  was  performed  to  differentiate  motile 
bacteria  from  non-motile  one  using  motility  indole  urea  (MIU) 
medium.  All  media  and  reagents  were  purchased  from  (HiMedia, 
India). 
 
 
Molecular characterization by PCR 
 
DNA Extraction: Bacterial DNA was extracted by Wizard® Genomic 
DNA  Purification  Kit  (Promega,  USA)  and  followed  the  instruction 
from  the  manufacturer.  All  samples  were  examined  by  a  pair  of 
primers to detect 16s rRNA gene, Sequence of PCR primer is (5´-
3´),  upper  strand  ACTGGCGTTATCCCTTTCTCTGGTG, 
lower 
strand-  ATGTTGTCCTGCCCCTGGTAAGAGA  and  the  amplicon 
Size was 496 bp (Noah et al., 1993). A volume of 1 µL of prepared 
DNA  (0.5  µg)  was  added  to  a  final  volume  of  25  µL  PCR  mixture 
containing 12.5 µL  of 2X Master Mix (Promega, USA),  1 µL of 10 
pmol/µL  each  primer  and  9.5  µL  of  sterile  distilled  water.  Thermal 
cycler was programmed with 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 65°C for 30 
s,  72°C  for  45  s  and  an  initial  denaturation  at  94°C  for  5  min  with 
final extension at 72°C for 7 min.  PCR amplification was performed 
on a thermo cycler (Eppendorf Personal, Germany). PCR products 
were  separated  on  1.5%  agarose  gel,  stained  with  ethidium 
bromide  and  photographed  using  a  Gel  documentation  system 
(BioRad,  Germany).  Salmonella  reference  strain  was  used  as 
positive  control.  Ten  microliters  of  each  PCR  products  were 
analyzed  in  agarose  (Sigma,  USA)  gel,  stained  with  ethidium 
bromide  (0.5  µg/ml)  and  examined  under  US  Solo  TS  (BioRad, 
Germany).  The  positive  sample  was  monitored  based  on  the 
expected size of band in the gel. 
 
 
Antimicrobial susceptibility test 
 
In  vitro  antibiotic  sensitivity  test  was  performed  according  to  the 
guidelines  of  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standard  Institute  (CLSI, 
2012).  Colistin  sulphate  (25  µg/disc),  erythromycin  (15  µg/disc), 
cloxacillin  (5  µg/disc),  ciprofloxacin  (5  µg/disc),  neomycin  (30 
µg/disc) and amoxicillin (10 µg/disc) were used in this study. Briefly, 
isolated colonies of the same morphological type were selected and 
grown  in  5  ml  of  a  nutrient  broth.  Sterile  cotton  swab  was  dipped 
into  the  broth  suspension.  The  turbidity  of  broth  was  adjusted  with 
0.5 McFarland turbidity standards before swab on MHA.  The swab 
was inoculated into Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) plate using standard 
microbiological  protocol 
the  agar  surface.  The 
predetermined  battery  of  antimicrobial  discs  is  dispensed  onto  the 
surface  of  the  inoculated  agar  plate.  Each  disc  must  be  pressed 
down  to  ensure  complete  contact  with  the  agar  surface.  Whether 
the  discs  were  placed  down  individually  or  with  a  dispensing 
apparatus,  they  must  be  distributed  evenly  so  that  they  are  no 
closer than 24 mm from centre  to centre. The plates were inverted 
and placed in an incubator set to 37°C within 15 min after the disc 
were applied. 
 
 
Reading plates and interpreting results 
 
After 
the  plate  was 
satisfactorily  streaked,  and  the  inoculum  was  correct,  the  resulting 
zones  of  inhibition  will  be  uniformly  circular  and  there  will  be  a 
confluent  lawn  of  growth.  If  individual  colonies  were  apparent,  the 
inoculums  were  too  light  and  the  test  must  be  repeated.  The 
diameters  of  the  inhibition  of  zones  were  measured  to  the  nearest 
whole  millimeter,  using  sliding  calipers  or  a  ruler,  which  is  held  on 
the  back  of  the  inverted  Petri  plate.  The  Petri  dishes  is  held  a  few 
inches  above  a  non  reflecting  background  and  illuminated  with 
reflected  light.  The  results  were  recorded  at  16  to  18  h  post

incubation  each  plate 

is  examined.

incubation.  Transmitted  light  is  used  to  examine  the  zone  of 
inhibition.  The  zone  margins  were  taken  as  the  area  showing  no 
obvious, visible growth that can be  detected with the unaided  eye. 
Faint  growth  of  tiny  colonies,  which  can  be  detected  only  with  a 
magnifying  lens  at  the  edge  of  the  zone  of  inhibited  growth,  is 
ignored.  The  sizes  of  the  zones  of  inhibition  were  interpreted 
according  to  Zone  of  Diameter  Interpretative  Standards  of  CLSI 
(2012).

Antibiotic sensitivity test 
 
Antibiogram  using  six  drugs  revealed  5(31.25%)  strains 
to  be  resistant  and  5(31.25%)  intermediate  towards 
Ciprofloxacin. Fourteen (87.5%) isolates were resistant to 
Amoxicillin,  while  fourteen  (87.5%)  were  found  inter-
mediate  resistance  towards  Neomycin.    However,  none 
of  the  isolates  were  sensitive  to  Cloxacilin  and  Erythro-
mycin, two (12.50%)  were  intermediate  and  14 (87.50%) 
were  resistant.  In  case  of  Colistine  sulphate,  8(50%) 
isolates were resistant while the remaining 8 (50%) were 
intermediate (Figure 5).

The  isolates  were  confirmed  as  Salmonella  by  cultural 
staining, motility, biochemical and PCR. Finally, antibiotic 
sensitivity  and  resistance  patterns  of  the  isolates  of 
broiler  chickens  identified  in  this  study.  Among  50 
isolates,  16  isolates  were  positive  for  Salmonella.  All 
isolates  were  cultured  in  S-S  agar  and  produce  single 
colony of Salmonella spp. Then, isolates were inoculated 
in  EMV  agar  and  give  pink  color  colony  which  helps  to 
distinguish  the  positive  isolates.  Meanwhile,  Salmonella 
spp. produce pink color with black center after inoculating 
the  isolates  into  XLD  agar  medium.  The  microscopic 
examination  of  Gram’s  stain  revealed  Gram-negative, 
pink  colored,  short  rod  shaped  bacteria,  arranged  in 
single  and  paired  (Freeman,  1985;  Jones  et  al.,  1997; 
Gene,  2002).  All  of  the  isolates  were  positive  for  Methyl 
Red test. Among 16 isolates 10 isolates were found to be 
non motile characterized by forming the stab line without 
producing  turbidity  in  the  Motility  Indole  Urea  (MIU) 
medium  and  another  6  isolates  were  found  motile 
characterized  by  changing  of  colour  of  MIU  medium.  In 
motility  test,  motile  isolates  showed  swinging  movement 
which  correlated  with  the  results  of  Buxton  and  Fraser 
(1977)  and  Merchant  and  Packer  (1967).  PCR  with 
16sRNA  gene  detecting  primer  produce  496  bp  band 
directs  the  positive  result  for  Salmonella  spp.  Six  drugs 
were  used  for  antibiogram  study.  These  six  drugs  were 
Colistine  sulphate,  Erythromycine,  Cloxaciline,  Cipro-
floxacin,  Neomycin  and  Amoxyciline.  Antibiogram 
analysis  revealed  5(31.25%)  strains  to  be  resistant 
towards  Ciprofloxacin.  Fourteen  (87.5%)  isolates  were 
resistant  to  Amoxicillin,  while  fourteen  (87.5%)  were 
found 
towards  Neomycin. 
However, none of the isolates were sensitive to Cloxacilin 
and  Erythromycin,  two  (12.50%)  were  intermediate  and 
14  (87.50%)  were  resistant.  These  results  were  more  or 
less  similar 
(Haque,  2011; 
Rayamajhi  et  al.,  2010;  Dallal  et  al.,  2009).  In  case  of 
Colistine  sulphate,  8(50%)  isolates  were  resistant  while 
the  remaining  8  (50%)  were  intermediate.  The  results 
directed  that  broiler  chickens  play  important  role  as 
reservoirs of multi-drug resistant Salmonella.

Infection  by  Salmonella  is  a  common  cause  of  food 
poisoning  in  humans  (Hobbs  and  Robert,  1993).  Human 
might get Salmonella infection easily during processing of 
poultry carcass and close contact with poultry in live bird 
markets and farms. Therefore, it is  of great public  health 
significance to study the prevalence of  Salmonella  in the 
apparently  healthy  broiler  chickens  available  in  the  live 
bird  markets  and  farms  to  assess  and  eliminate  the  risk 
originated from those. Thereby, this 

 research  was  aimed  to  create  public  consciousness 
revealing  the  risks  of  Salmonella  infection  with  the 
healthy broiler chickens. Data of this study suggests that, 
broiler  chickens  at  farms  and  live  bird  markets  are  the 
major  reservoirs  of  Salmonella  spp.  that  might  be 
potential  cause  of  food  poisoning  if  proper  hygienic 
measure is not undertaken during  rearing,  handling  and

Conclusion  
 
The  research  work  was  undertaken  with  a  view  to 
isolating  Salmonella  spp.  from cloacal  samples  of  broiler 
chickens.  Results  of  the  study  direct  that  isolates  from 
broilers  are  being multi-drug resistant  which may  be  due 
to  indiscriminate  and  continuous  use  of  sub  therapeutic 
doses of antibiotics during rearing in commercial production 
system.  Therefore,  more  sensible  use  of  antibiotics  can 
be  strongly  suggested  for  the  veterinarians  since  drug 
resistance could be a major public health. These findings 
would certainly help the veterinarians to select the correct 
antibiotics  against  Salmonella 
infections.  However, 
fluoroquinolones  are  important  antimicrobial  compounds 
in the treatment of Salmonellosis in humans. Overall, the 
prevalence  of  Salmonella  in  broiler  chickens  and  their 
drug  resistance  is  obviously  a  threat  to  public  health. 
Moreover, the disease caused by Salmonella has a great 
public health importance. Therefore, broiler sector should 
be  provided  with  immediate  attention  by  the  government 
to  maintain  strict  hygienic  measurement  in  farm  and  live 
bird  markets  all  over  the  country.  This  study  will  be 
helpful 
in  selecting  appropriate  antibiotics  against 
Salmonella infection.
