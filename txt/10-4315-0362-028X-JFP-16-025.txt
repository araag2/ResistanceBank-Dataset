ABSTRACT

Food-producing animals carrying extended-spectrum b-lactamase–producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) have posed a
potential threat to human and animal health. However, information regarding ESBL-EC in the intensive broiler breeding areas of
Shandong Province, People’s Republic of China, is very limited. The goal of our study was to investigate the prevalence and drug
resistance characteristics of ESBL-EC in healthy broilers from Shandong Province. A total of 142 ESBL-EC isolates were
collected from four prefectures in Shandong Province from October 2014 to February 2015. ESBL-EC isolates were frequently
detected (142 of 160 samples, 88.8%) in healthy broilers. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed that all 142 ESBL-EC isolates
were resistant to ampicillin, piperacillin, and cefazolin but were sensitive to imipenem and meropenem. All ESBL-EC isolates
carried one or more of the bla genes, in which blaCTX-M, blaTEM-1, and blaSHV-5 genes were identiﬁed in 142, 106, and 5 isolates,
respectively. The blaCTX-M gene includes blaCTX-M-15 (56), blaCTX-M-65 (42), blaCTX-M-55 (36), blaCTX-M-14 (21), blaCTX-M-79 (1),
blaCTX-M-3 (1), blaCTX-M-123 (1), and blaCTX-M-132 (1). In addition, 17 ESBL-EC isolates cocarried the genes of the CTX-M-1 and
CTX-M-9 groups. Our ﬁndings indicate that healthy broiler ﬂocks in Shandong Province in China are an important reservoir for
ESBL-EC, with blaCTX-M and blaTEM-1 being the prevalent resistance genes identiﬁed.

Key words: Broiler ﬂocks; CTX-M-1; CTX-M-9; Extended-spectrum b-lactamase genes; Extended-spectrum b-lactamase–
producing Escherichia coli

Extended-spectrum cephalosporins, especially third-
and fourth-generation cephalosporins, are very important
antimicrobial drugs for human and animals health (10).
However, extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL)–produc-
ing Enterobacteriaceae have posed serious challenges in
clinical practices. The main resistance mechanism of ESBL-
producing Enterobacteriaceae is through the production of
ESBL or plasmid-encoded AmpC b-lactamase. However,
the diversity of ESBL genes in Enterobacteriaceae from
food-producing animals is much higher than that of AmpC
genes (4, 28). ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC)
found in food-producing animals is frequently considered to
be a potential source of human ESBL-EC infection. The
increasing number of ESBL-EC isolates from food-produc-
ing animals has also raised great awareness and concern
worldwide (1, 24, 26).

Among the prevalent ESBL-EC from food-producing
animals, TEM, SHV, and CTX-M are considered to be the
most diverse. The ESBL genes are generally located on
plasmids, which could promote the dissemination of ESBL
genes in gram-negative bacteria (5). Compared with TEM and

SHV, CTX-M variants are more diversiﬁed and are the most
common ESBL genotype in E. coli
isolates from food-
producing animals in the People’s Republic of China (22). At
present, the prevalent CTX-M types in E. coli found in the
poultry of European countries include CTX-M-1, CTX-M-2,
and CTX-M-14, whereas those found in food-producing
animals in China are mainly CTX-M-15, CTX-M-55, CTX-
M-14, and CTX-M-65 (18, 22, 26, 30). The high prevalence
of CTX-M–producing E. coli in food-producing animals in
China may be because of the excessive use of antibiotics in
poultry, particularly the substantial selective pressure owing
to extensive use of b-lactam antibiotics.

it

The high prevalence of ESBL-EC in commensal E. coli
isolates from healthy animals suggests that commensal E.
coli may play a signiﬁcant role in serving as a resistance
gene reservoir. Therefore,
is necessary to know the
prevalence of ESBL-EC in healthy food animals. Shandong
Province is one of the largest broiler breeding provinces in
China, but information on the occurrence of ESBL-EC is
scarce. Hence, the goal of our study was to investigate the
prevalence and drug resistance characteristics of ESBL-EC
in healthy broiler chickens from Shandong Province,
People’s Republic of China.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample collection. Between October 2014 and February
2015, a total of 160 fresh fecal swabs were obtained from four
prefectures (Linyi, Weifang, Taian, and Zaozhuang) in Shandong
Province, People’s Republic of China (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The
fecal swabs were kept at 48C in an ice chest and immediately
transported to our lab. Within 12 h of collecting, the swabs were
processed for bacterial culture.

dime–clavulanic acid (30 and 10 lg) or cefotaxime (30 lg) and
cefotaxime–clavulanic acid (30 and 10 lg) were used in the
conﬁrmation test. An E. coli isolate was determined to be ESBL
producing when the diameter of the inhibition zone following the
addition of clavulanic acid to either ceftazidime or cefotaxime was
increased 5 mm compared with the addition of clavulanic acid
alone. E. coli ATCC 25922 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC
700603 were used as quality control strains.

Isolation and identiﬁcation of ESBL-EC. The fecal swabs
were plated onto MacConkey plates containing cefotaxime (4 lg/
ml) and cultured at 378C for 24 h. A pure colony per sample with
typical E. coli morphology was picked up for further character-
ization by Vitek MS system (bioM´erieux, Inc., Marcy l’ ´Etoile,
France) and by PCR for the uidA gene (13) with ExTaq DNA
polymerase (Takara, Dalian, People’s Republic of China) and
primers, as described previously (Table 1). Ampliﬁcation condi-
tions of the PCR were as follows: initial denaturation at 948C for 5
min, 35 cycles of 948C for 1 min, 578C for 1 min, and 728C for 1
in, and a ﬁnal extension at 728C for 7 min.

Conﬁrmation of ESBL-EC. Conﬁrmation of ESBL-EC was
based on the disk diffusion method (9). Brieﬂy, two pairs of
susceptibility disks containing ceftazidime (30 lg) and ceftazi-

Antibiotic susceptibility testing. Susceptibility testing of
ESBL-EC to 17 antimicrobial agents (Tianhe, Hangzhou, People’s
Republic of China) commonly used in Shandong Province was
performed by the disk diffusion method (9), including ampicillin
(10 lg), piperacillin (30 lg), cefazolin (30 lg), cefotaxime (30 lg),
cefepime (30 lg), aztreonam (30 lg), ampicillin-sulbactam (10 and
10 lg), ceftazidime (30 lg), amoxicillin-clavulanate (20 and 10
lg), piperacillin-tazobactam (100 and 10 lg), tetracycline (30 lg),
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (1.25 and 23.75 lg), ciproﬂoxacin
(5 lg), levoﬂoxacin (5 lg), gentamicin (10 lg), amikacin (30 lg),
imipenem (10 lg), and meropenem (10 lg). Results of
the
antibiotic susceptibility testing were interpreted according to the
guidelines of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (9).
Isolates were considered multidrug resistant when they were
resistant to three or more classes of antibiotics.

Detection of b-lactamase genes. The DNAs of ESBL-EC
isolates were extracted by the boiling lysis method (11). ESBL-EC
isolates were analyzed for the presence of genes encoding TEM,
SHV and CTX-M by PCR (19, 21, 27) with ExTaq DNA
polymerase (Takara) and primers, as described previously (Table
1). Ampliﬁcation conditions were initial denaturation at 948C for 5
min, 35 cycles of 948C for 1 min, 56 to 578C (depending on the
primers) for 1 min, and 728C for 1 min, and a ﬁnal extension at
728C for 7 min.

DNA sequencing analysis. PCR products were sequenced by
using an ABI3730 Automated Sequencer (BaseClear, Leiden, The
Netherlands). The reagent kit used in this process was purchased
from the TianGen Limited Company, Beijing, People’s Republic
of China. Forward and reverse sequences were aligned with
reference sequences in the BLAST database (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to conﬁrm b-lactamase type (http://www.lahey.
org/Studies).

Phylogenetic grouping of ESBL-EC. ESBL-EC was
discriminated in phylogenetic groups (A, B1, B2, C, D, E, or F),
as previously described by Clermont et al. (7, 8).

RESULTS

Isolation and identiﬁcation of ESBL-EC. A total of
142 E. coli isolates were collected from 160 fresh fecal
samples (142 of 160, 88.8%)
in four prefectures of
Shandong Province in China, and all 142 E. coli showed
the ESBL phenotype (Table 2).

Antimicrobial susceptibility of ESBL-EC. Antimi-
crobial susceptibility testing showed that 142 ESBL-EC
isolates from four different prefectures had a more or less
similar resistance trend, and these isolates were all resistant
to ampicillin, piperacillin, and cefazolin. One hundred forty
(98.6%), 135 (95.1%), 110 (77.5%), 82 (57.7%), 46
(32.4%), 18 (12.7%), and 12 (8.5%) of 142 ESBL-EC
isolates were resistant to cefotaxime, cefepime, aztreonam,
ampicillin-sulbactam, ceftazidime, amoxicillin-clavulanate,
and piperacillin-tazobactam, respectively.

Of note, some of these isolates were also resistant to other
tetracycline (139 of 142, 97.9%),
classes of antibiotics:
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (130 of 142, 91.5%), ciproﬂox-
acin (121 of 142, 85.2%), levoﬂoxacin (104 of 142, 73.2%),
gentamicin (103 of 142, 72.5%), and amikacin (56 of 142,
39.4%). However, 142 ESBL-EC isolates were all susceptible
to imipenem and meropenem. In addition, 95.8% (136 of 142)
of these ESBL-EC isolates were multidrug resistant.

Characterization of b-lactamase genes. All ESBL-EC
isolates carried one or more of the genes from blaCTX-M,
blaTEM, and blaSHV families. Of these 142 ESBL-EC, blaCTX-M
was the dominant genotype, and the most frequently detected
blaCTX-M type was blaCTX-M-15 (56), followed by blaCTX-M-65
(42), blaCTX-M-55 (36), blaCTX-M-14 (21), blaCTX-M-79 (1),
blaCTX-M-3 (1), blaCTX-M-123 (1), and blaCTX-M-132 (1). One
hundred six (of 142, 74.6%) isolates were found to be positive
for blaTEM-1, and these isolates also carried CTX-M-genes. In
addition, 5 ESBL-EC isolates carried blaSHV-5, and two
blaCTX-M-type genes (CTX-M-1 and CTX-M-9) were
conﬁrmed to coexist in 17 ESBL-EC isolates. Of note, two
kinds of chimeric genes were found in this study, including
blaCTX-M-123 and blaCTX-M-132 (Table 3).

Phylogenetic grouping of ESBL-EC. Phylogenetic
grouping revealed, among 142 ESBL-EC isolates, 62
(43.6%) belonged to group A, 46 (32.4%) to group D, 22
(15.5%) to group B1, and 12 (8.5%) to group B2 (Table 4).

DISCUSSION

A total of 142 ESBL-EC isolates were collected in this
study, which showed relatively high resistance rates (77.5 to
100%) to b-lactam antibiotics, including ampicillin, piper-
acillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, cefepime, and aztreonam. In
addition, these isolates demonstrated an alarming resistance to
combinations of b-lactams and b-lactamase inhibitors, with
high susceptibility to ceftazidime only. One hundred forty-
two ESBL-EC isolates were divided into four phylogenetic
groups: group A was dominant, followed by group D, group
B2, and group B1. The results are consistent with a previous
investigation conducted in Northeast China (26).

In this study, 136 (95.8%) of 142 ESBL-EC were
multidrug resistant, which is signiﬁcantly higher than the
proportion (80.6%) reported from Henan Province, People’s
Republic of China by Yuan et al. (29). These results indicate
that a multidrug resistant phenomenon in chicken ESBL-EC
is becoming increasingly serious. Although we could not
obtain detailed information on the antibiotics added to the
poultry feed, under normal circumstances, its use in the feed
exerts a selective pressure on the colonization of intestinal
bacteria in the animals (10).

In recent years, the number of ESBL-producing gram-
negative bacteria from food-producing animals has been
increasing due to the extensive use of extended-spectrum b-
lactam antibiotics in the broiler breeding industry of China
(14, 15, 26). PCR results showed that 106 ESBL-EC isolates
were positive for the blaTEM-1 gene, with a detection rate of
74.6%. This indicates that TEM-1 is a relatively common b-
lactamase in chicken ESBL-EC isolated from Shandong
Province in China. Of note, compared with previous studies
conducted in other provinces in China (16, 30), this study
indicates an increasing carrier rate of TEM-1 in ESBL-EC
isolated from food animals.

Bauernfeind et al. (2) ﬁrst discovered the CTX-M–type
ESBL in E. coli, STX-M-1, so named owing to its hydrolytic
activity on cefotaxime. It has been veriﬁed that the blaCTM
gene originally came from bacteria of the genus Kluyvera
(23). Currently, CTX-M–type b-lactamase, the most prev-

alent non-TEM and non-SHV type ESBL in Enterobacte-
riaceae (6),
is the world’s most common and widely
disseminated ESBL. The CTX-M–type b-lactamase family
shows a high degree of plasticity, and the CTX-M cluster is
prevalent and is widely distributed geographically (3). The
CTX-M–type b-lactamases found in European countries,
such as blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-2, and blaCTX-M-14, are mainly
associated with E. coli isolated from poultry (17). In China,
blaCTX-M-14 is the most prevalent type of ESBL in isolates
from animals, and blaCTX-M-55 is slowly replacing blaCTX-M-15
as the second most prevalent blaCTX-M gene (22, 30).

In this study, all 142 ESBL-EC isolates carried blaCTX-M
genes that were mainly blaCTX-M-15 and blaCTX-M-14 from the
CTX-M-1 and CTX-M-9 enzyme clusters, respectively. These
data are consistent with those reported from other areas of
China (22, 26). We found two kinds of chimeric genes,
including blaCTX-M-123 and blaCTX-M-132. According to He et
al. (12), these chimeric blaCTX-M genes are composed of
different fragments from the CTX-M-1 and CTX-M-9 gene
clusters. These gene cluster fragments may have resulted from
homologous recombination of two genes (CTX-M-1 and
CTX-M-9 clusters) that were colocalized within the same

isolate. Here, we determined that genes from the CTX-M-1
and CTX-M-9 clusters were simultaneously present in 17
ESBL-EC isolates. In fact, it has already been reported that
multiple CTX-M types of b-lactamase can be present in the
same isolate, which may contribute to the emergence of
chimeric enzymes (26, 29).

In the past few years, blaSHV has been occasionally
detected in E. coli isolates from animals in China, with only
a few studies reporting the presence of blaSHV-5 in E. coli
isolates from dogs and chickens (14, 25, 26). In this study,
we detected the blaSHV-5 gene in 5 ESBL-EC isolates;
however, further studies are required to determine its source
of origin.

In summary, 142 E. coli isolates from 160 fresh fecal
samples (142 of 160, 88.8%) were all ESBL-EC, and their
main resistance mechanism to b-lactams was through the
production of TEM-1, CTX-M, and SHV-5 b-lactamases.
Rational use of antibiotics in veterinary practice is necessary
to reduce the prevalence and dissemination of drug
resistance bacteria in food animals.
