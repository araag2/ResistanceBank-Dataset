The purpose of this study was to investigate bacterial load in ready-to-sale sheep meat with special reference
to Salmonella. Samples were collected from 100 sheep carcasses from retail meat shops in domestic markets.
On carcasses, where bacterial counts were obtained, the mean of the log10 aerobic plate count was

for E. coli and 3.0% were positive for Salmonella. The isolates were serotyped as Salmonella infantis having
antigenic structure 6, 7: r: 1, 5. Antibiogram revealed highest (100.0%) sensitivity towards amikacin,
ceftriaxone, ciproﬂoxacin, chloramphenicol, colistin sulphate, gentamicin and nalidixic acid followed by
cefuroxime and tetracycline (66.67% each) and cotrimoxazole (33.33%). All the strains were resistant to
ampicillin.

Introduction

Meat arriving at the retail markets is contaminated
with inordinate number of bacteria. Therefore, car-
casses with lowest possible microbial load should be
obtained, as microbes have direct bearing on the shelf
life of fresh meat and bacteriological quality of the
meat products.

that

The microbial quality of sheep meat has not been
studied suﬃciently, despite the fact
lamb is
consumed in considerable quantities in many parts
of the world, especially in the Middle and near East
countries (Sajida et al., 1982). Most of the sheep meat
produced in India is sold fresh in the retail market
where meagre attention is paid towards hygiene.
Extensive review of literature reveals that not much
work has been done in India on the bacteriological
quality of
sheep meat. The product quality and
standards that are followed in India, at present, are
based on the ﬁndings of foreign workers, which are
not appropriate for various reasons such as variation
in climatic conditions, socioeconomic status of produ-
cer and consumer, diﬀerences in the animal husbandry
practices and subsequent slaughtering and processing
of the animals. Hence, if any standards are to be laid,
the guidelines should be set in such a way that they
conﬁrm to the prevailing conditions in the country

and at the same time ensure the high quality of the
product. Hence, survey of the present bacteriological
status of sheep meat is of immense importance for
rationalising the standards of the sheep meat and its
products in India.

In its demand for animal proteins, humanity is often
exposed to food-borne infections and intoxications.
Every year millions of people are aﬀected by food-
borne diseases and thousands die of
it. Improper
methods of food production, storage, handling and
preparation have resulted in many recognised interna-
tional outbreaks. Globalisation of trade has further
facilitated the spread of
food-borne infections and
diseases between distantly placed nations. Accordingly,
foods of animal origin need to be closely monitored
during production as well as during handling, processing
and distribution (Anon., 2002).

India also has a good export potential for meat
owing to its huge livestock population. However,
failure to maintain the internationally accepted hygie-
nic and microbial standards has resulted in ban on
import of Indian meat by several countries in the past
(Chander, 2003). Among various health hazards, food-
borne bacteria,
especially those of non-typhoidal
Salmonella, are most important and common. Hence,
the present study was undertaken to assess the level of
Salmonella contamination in fresh sheep meat with
special reference to the serotypes, pathogenicity and
antibiogram.

Materials and methods

This study was conducted at diﬀerent retail market
shops of sheep meat, located in Mhow town of Madhya
Pradesh (India). One hundred samples were taken from
randomly selected ﬁve retail market shops on every
Sunday. Not more than ﬁve samples were taken at a
time, one each from ﬁve diﬀerent meat shops. Micro-
biological examination was carried out within an hour
after the collection of samples.

The samples were collected as per the procedure
recommended by International Commission on Micro-
biological Speciﬁcation for Food (ICMSF, 1978). Sam-
ples were collected by excision method (destructive
method) taking approximately 10 g samples from each
of the ﬁve sites, viz. neck, right forelimbs and hind limbs
and left forelimbs and hind limbs (Amin & Borah,
2002). These samples were transferred to the laboratory
in sterile stomacher bags on ice. Samples that were
above 10 °C upon arrival at the testing laboratory were
discarded.

Samples were thawed to room temperature. The
sample collected from ﬁve diﬀerent sites of each carcass
was pooled in one stomacher bag. The pooled sample
was then homogenised at 8000 r.p.m. for 2 min in
450 mL of normal saline solution (NSS) to obtain 1:10
dilution. Subsequently, tenfold serial dilution up to
)10 were carried out in sterile NSS (ICMSF, 1978).
10
This 1:10 diluted sample was used as an inoculum for
determination of Salmonella.

In the present study, aerobic plate count (APC), total
coliform count (TCC) and total Escherichia coli count
(TEC) of each pooled sheep carcass sample were enu-
merated according to the method described by ICMSF
(1978) with minor modiﬁcations. For enumeration pur-
pose, from each tenfold dilution, 0.1 mL was transferred
with the help of sterile pipettes on a sterile media plate.
The inoculum was then spread by a spreader (hockey-
stick-like glass rod). For each dilution triplicates of
appropriate media and diﬀerent sets of sterile pipettes and
spreader were used (Table 1). The inoculated plates were
kept at room temperature for 30 min to allow the
inoculum to be adsorbed and then incubated at 37 °C
for 24 h. The bacterial colonies were counted using digital
colony counter (Model No. 361; M/s Environmental and
Scientiﬁc Instrument Co. Pvt. Ltd, India).

For calculation of counts (APC, TCC and TEC), the
mean count of three plates was multiplied with the

dilution factor (Prasad & Yadava, 2000). All counts
were converted to log values to enable statistical analysis
based on the assumption of normal distributions. Data
were statistically analysed as per the method suggested
by Snedecor & Cochran (1994).

The 1:10 diluted sample was used as initial inoculum
for the detection of Salmonella. The samples were pre-
enriched in 10 mL buﬀered peptone water
(pH
7.0 ± 0.1) by inoculating 1 mL of 1:10 diluted sample
and incubating for 48 h at 37 °C. After pre-enrichment,
1 mL of inoculated buﬀered peptone water was trans-
ferred into 10 mL of modiﬁed Rappaport–Vassiliadis
(MRV) medium (M/s Biomark, Pune,
India) and
incubated at 37 °C and 43 °C for a maximum period
of 7 days. A loopful from enriched MRV medium was
inoculated onto brilliant green sulpha agar and deso-
xycholate citrate agar (DCA) (M/s Biomark) at 37 °C
for 24–48 h to obtain well-isolated colonies.

The isolated colonies on selective media were identi-
ﬁed as Salmonella on the basis of
their cultural,
morphological and biochemical characteristics (Barrow
& Feltham, 1993). These were conﬁrmed serologically
by slide agglutination test using anti-Salmonella poly-
valent
(A–G) and H antisera. The conﬁrmed
Salmonella isolates were sent for serotyping at the
National Salmonella Typing Centre, Central Research
Institute (CRI), Kasauli.

‘O’

The isolates that were conﬁrmed as Salmonella after
serotyping were used for pathogenicity testing, which
was determined by inoculating 0.1 mL of 18-h old broth
culture (ca 3 · 108 viable bacteria per mL) of each
isolate into separate adult Swiss albino mice by intra-
peritoneal route; two mice per isolate were used. The
inoculated mice were observed up to 96-h postinocula-
tion and those that died were necropsied and examined
for gross lesions. Impression smears were prepared from
visceral organs and heart blood of dead mice and
stained by Gram’s method to demonstrate bacteria. To
prove Koch–Henle’s postulates, attempts were also
made to reisolate Salmonellae from heart blood on
DCA.

To test production of toxin(s) by the isolates, proce-
dure of Giannella (1976) was adopted with minor
modiﬁcations. Each bacterial strain was cultured in
brain–heart infusion (BHI) broth at 37 °C for 18 h in
shaker incubator (G-24; American Laboratory Trading,
New Brunswick, NJ, USA) at a speed of 200 r.p.m.
Subsequently, broth culture was centrifuged at 12 298g.
for 45 min at 4 °C in a refrigerated centrifuge (C-23;
Remi, Mumbai, India) to sediment the bacterial cells.
The supernatant was aseptically collected, passed
through a membrane ﬁlter (F-25DB Laxbro, Millipore,
Pune, India) of 0.22 lm diameter porosity and stored at
)20 °C until use. The toxic eﬀect of this cell free ﬁltrate
(CFF) was tested by inoculating 0.1 mL in adult healthy
Swiss albino mice by intraperitoneal route. Two mice

per strain were used and one mouse was kept as control
in which equal volume of sterile BHI broth was injected.
The mice were observed up to 96-h postinoculation and
those found dead were necropsied and examined for
gross lesions.

The sensitivity of isolates towards eleven diﬀerent
antibiotics was determined by in vitro disc diﬀusion
method of Bauer et al. (1966) on Muellor–Hinton agar
(M/s BioMark). The drugs used for sensitivity testing
included ampicillin (10 mcg),
amikacin (30 mcg),
ceftriaxone (30 mcg), cefuroxime (30 mcg), colistin

Results

Bacteriological quality of sheep carcasses from Mhow
town of India is summarised in Table 2. A total of 100
samples representing the bacteriological quality of sheep
carcasses were collected from ﬁve diﬀerent local shops.
Mean log10 APC for sheep carcasses was 7.26, maximum
and minimum being 7.51 and 7.04, respectively. Mean
log10 TCC for sheep carcasses was 4.11, maximum and
minimum being 4.28 and 3.78, respectively. Mean log10
TEC for sheep carcasses was 3.03, maximum and
minimum being 3.36 and 2.78, respectively.

Salmonellae were isolated from 3.0% sheep meat
samples. In present study Salmonellae were isolated
following enrichment at 43 °C than at 37 °C. However,
delayed enrichment up to 7 days did not increase the
isolation rate of Salmonella. Biochemical characterisa-
tion of all the three isolates conﬁrmed majority of
reactions to be that of typical Salmonellae. However,
variation was recorded in utilisation of Simmon’s citrate
medium and rhamnose, only 66.67% isolates were
positive for these tests. Similarly, contrary to standard
results, none of the strain fermented inositol, while all
utilised dulcitol, maltose,
sorbitol and xylose and
produced H2S gas.

Pathogenicity testing of bacterial culture as well as
CFF of all the three isolates resulted in death of mice
within 12-h postinoculation, whereas control mice
survived even after 96-h postinoculation. The gross
lesions observed were acute gastroenteritis with hae-
morrhages and accumulation of ﬂuid in gut. The
bacteria also caused septicaemia with congestion of
internal organs. Impression smears revealed the pres-
ence of Gram-negative coccobacilli. Salmonella was
reisolated from the heart blood of dead mice con-
ﬁrming Koch–Henle’s postulates.

isolates recovered from sheep meat were resistant to
ampicillin; whereas 66.67% were sensitive to cefuroxime
and tetracycline, and only 33.33% sensitive to cotrim-
oxazole.

Discussion

The present study is based on excised sheep carcasses.
APCs were accepted as a useful hygiene indicator for the
microbial contamination of carcasses and in combina-
tion with TECs as veriﬁcation of slaughter hygiene
(Mackey & Roberts, 1993). APC results reported in this
investigation for
sheep carcasses after destructive

Thus, all the 100 samples examined in the present study
had the counts higher than the proposed Indian stand-
ards. High APC can be dangerous for the consumers, as
some of the microorganisms could be pathogenic (Berry
& Foegeding, 1997).

High coliform count indicated poor hygienic quality
of sheep meat. The contamination with coliforms may
occur during slaughtering, cutting or dressing of
carcasses, soiled hands, shopping blocks or knives used
for handling and cutting or contaminated water are the
important sources of coliforms in meat. Moreover, Bell
et al. (1993) reported that high number of bacteria could
be transferred from the ﬂeece of sheep to the carcass

surface during hide removal. Bell & Hathaway (1996)
reported that the areas of the highest contamination in
carcasses were the sites where cuts are made through the
skin.

The forty-nine carcass samples in the current study
)1 was considered
had detectable E. coli (less than 2 cfu g
non-detectable). So the mean count of the E. coli was
taken from detectable samples only. Higher count of
E. coli from sheep meat suggests faecal contamination
and contact with contaminated water or equipment to
be more frequent at the site in particular and on the
whole carcasses in general as a result of the slaughtering
techniques used.

The incidence of Salmonella (3.0%) found on sheep
carcasses might be due to the relatively high incidence
and numbers of E. coli. Similar ﬁndings were also
reported by Vanderlinde et al. (1999) who observed
5.74% samples positive for Salmonella. According to
BIS (1995), sheep meat should be completely free from
Salmonella. Salmonella may be carried on the ﬂeece
or in internal organs,
thus cross contamination of
meat may occur during deﬂeecing or evisceration of
carcasses.

In the present

investigation, higher

temperature
(43 °C) during enrichment was found to favour the
recovery of Salmonella over other enteric bacteria,
which has earlier been reported by Siems et al. (1975).
The recovery of atypical Salmonella from sheep meat, as
observed in the present study, was in agreement with the
ﬁndings of Shivhare et al. (2000) who also reported
atypical Salmonella from animal and animal products.
Salmonella infantis recovered in this study rank among
the twenty most important Salmonella serotypes of
public health signiﬁcance, according to WHO report
the
(Anon, 1988). Food poisoning as a result of
consumption of meat contaminated with S.
infantis
has been reported from diﬀerent parts of the world
(Kohl & Farley, 2000; Gonera, 2002). Thus, isolation of
this serovar warrants adaptation of proper precautions.
Pathology of non-adopted Salmonellae and their CFF
in mice as observed in this research pursuit was also
recorded by Shivhare et al.
(2000). Salmonella can
readily penetrate intestinal mucosa causing acute septi-
caemia. It also elaborates number of toxins including
heat-labile enterotoxin that leads to accumulation of
ﬂuid (Sedlock et al., 1978). The results of
in vitro
antibiotic sensitivity test observed in this research
pursuit were also reported by Sharma & Joshi (1992)
and Bacon et al. (2002).

The high counts suggest that sheep marketed in the
area under study is not ﬁt for human consumption.
Recovery of Salmonella, which is one of the important
causes of food poisoning, is alarming and should be
viewed seriously. The isolation of pathogenic strains
suggest that either diseased or carrier animals were used
for slaughtering, or the hygienic conditions in the

slaughterhouses and meat shops were of very low
standards. The production of such poor quality sheep
meat predisposes it to early spoilage as well as a threat
to the health of the consumer. The animals slaughtered
for human consumption should be healthy and disease
free. Hence, strict hygienic measures should be adopted
during slaughtering, processing and transportation of
meat and meat products for producing the end product
of eatable quality.
