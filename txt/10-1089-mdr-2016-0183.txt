This study was designed and conducted to evaluate the frequency, antimicrobial resistance, and presence of six
virulence-associated genes among thermophilic Campylobacters isolated from raw milk, poultry (chicken,
turkey, and duck), ﬁsh, cattle, and sheep meat. Out of 590 samples, which were recovered from different
origins, 141 (23.9%) samples were positive for Campylobacters. Campylobacter spp. was isolated in 40.8%
(106/260), 14% (28/200), and 8.7% (7/80) of poultry meat, red meat, and milk samples, respectively. Anti-
microbial susceptibility test indicated a high frequency of resistance to ciproﬂoxacin, tetracycline, and nalidixic
acid among the isolates. Furthermore, prevalence of waaC, ciaB, and pldA genes were 91.7%, 86.7%, and
80.8%, respectively; and, none of the isolates harbored both wlaN and cgtB genes, simultaneously. Moreover,
there was a weak correlation between antibiotics resistance and presence of the pathogen genes. However, the
existence of Campylobacter spp. isolates in food animal products, with high resistance to antibiotics and several
virulence gene possessions, is alarming and increases the attention to the widespread use of antibiotics.

Introduction

M embers of genus Campylobacter, a group of gram-

negative, spiral-shaped bacteria, are a number of
pathogens that can cause gastroenteritis and traveler’s di-
arrhea in humans.1,2 This group of bacteria, particularly
thermophilic Campylobacter spp., is one of the most im-
portant microorganisms causing foodborne illnesses in
developed and developing countries. Among these thermo-
philic Campylobacters, Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli are
more virulent and can cause different diseases in humans.3–5
As a zoonotic pathogen, Campylobacter spp. can be trans-
mitted to humans through consumption and/or handling of
contaminated food, mainly fresh and atmosphere-modiﬁed
packed meat, raw milk, water, seafood, and vegetables.1,2,6
Poultry products have been suggested as the most signiﬁcant
sources of Campylobacter spp. infections;1,7,8 on the other
hand, cattle and sheep can also carry C. jejuni and C. coli.9

Campylobacters can naturally colonize the gastrointestinal
tracts of food animals and can contaminate the skin, meat,
and meat products of these animals during slaughter and
other processing stages in the slaughterhouse.10 Therefore,
implementation and monitoring of control programs at the
production level are necessary to avoid a high level of
contamination.1,2

It is well known that the rise of antimicrobial resistance
and multidrug-resistant phenotypes in bacteria is a world-
wide concern. The excessive use of antimicrobial drugs in
veterinary medicine for controlling diseases or increasing the
growth in food animals, and misuse of antibiotics in medi-
cine are related to these resistances.11,12 Furthermore, due to
the use of similar antibiotics in veterinary and human med-
icine, the multidrug-resistant microorganisms develop and
disseminate in humans after the extensive use of antibiot-
ics.5,13 In addition, resistance to one antimicrobial agent may
provide cross-protection against another.13

Selective drugs for human severe campylobacteriosis are
erythromycin and ciproﬂoxacin, which are the members of
the macrolide and ﬂuoroquinolone families, respectively. In
addition, gentamicin, tetracycline, and ampicillin can be used
in medicine for the treatment of systemic Campylobacter
spp. infections.14,15 Although ﬁve antibiotics (ciproﬂoxacin,
erythromycin, gentamicin, ampicillin, and tetracycline) are
used against campylobacteriosis as the most important drugs,
other antibiotics like amikacin can be used as an alternative
treatment or a synergist drug for the mentioned antibiotics.2,14
Resistance to two antibiotics, belonging to a certain
family, may indicate genetic characteristics of resistance,
which can also affect the rest of those family members in a
speciﬁc bacteria.13 So, a study is needed to evaluate the
antibiotic resistance of the main Campylobacter spp. infec-
tion’s drugs and other similar antibiotics, which can belong
to the same family. The increasing number of antibiotic-
resistant Campylobacter spp. isolates is a serious public
health issue over the last few years.2,16,17 Therefore, previ-
ous research need to be updated annually to obtain new data
about these antimicrobial resistances.

Certain virulence-associated genes play an important role
in the pathogenesis of Campylobacter spp. infections.18,19
ciaB (Campylobacter spp.-invasive antigen B),20 and pldA
(a gene that encodes an outer membrane phospholipase A)21
are involved in the invasion and colonization of the host
cells. VirB11, a plasmid-associated gene, is also associated
with host cell invasion.22 Genes cgtB, wlaN, and waaC are
involved in the b-1,3 galactosyltransferase production and
biosynthesis of
lipooligosaccharide (LOS). Presumably,
these later genes are connected to the expression of gan-
glioside mimics in Guillain-Barre’ syndrome, an acute pe-
ripheral polyneuropathy, after C. jejuni infection.18,23,24

In addition, along with the association between virulence
and clinical infection, the virulence factors may also be as-
sociated with the antimicrobial resistance.25 Furthermore, it is
proven that antimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter species
can cause severe diarrhea in comparison to antimicrobial-
susceptible strains.26 Thus, it is necessary to investigate the
relationships between these two characteristics, resistance
and virulence. Although, to the author’s knowledge, few, if
any, studies have focused on this issue.25,27 Hence, the oc-
currences of six virulence-associated genes were studied in
this research; then, the association between the virulence
factor of the pathogen and antimicrobial resistance was
evaluated through statistical analysis.

In addition,

The microbiological safety of food is an important issue
thermophilic
for consumers and industry.
Campylobacters, especially C. jejuni and C. coli, play im-
portant roles in most of the human Campylobacter spp. in-
fections. So,
this study was designed to evaluate the
prevalence of thermophilic Campylobacters in raw milk,
poultry, ﬁsh, and red meat. Furthermore, as it was men-
tioned above,
resistance,
virulence-associated genes, and the relationship between
them were analyzed in these isolates.

Materials and Methods

Study area and sample collection

A total of 590 samples were collected between July of
2014 and June of 2015 to determine the prevalence of

C. jejuni and C. coli in seven different types of food. The
following types of samples were used in this research: (i)
chicken meat, including samples from two sites along the
processing line in the slaughterhouse, after evisceration (50)
and 24-hr postchilling steps (50), 30 breast package samples,
and 30 samples from traditional markets; (ii) turkey meat,
including breast package (40) and 30 samples from tradi-
tional markets; (iii) duck meat, including 30 samples from
traditional markets; (iv) 50 samples from freshwater ﬁsh
(Salmo trutta) meat obtained from a traditional ﬁsh market;
(v) 200 cattle and sheep meat samples obtained from after
ﬁnal wash and 24-hr chilling steps in the slaughterhouse (50
samples per each animal/step); and (vi) 80 samples of milk,
including 40 samples from bulk tank milk and 40 samples
from ﬁlters.

The samples of the chicken, cattle, and sheep carcasses
were collected during 20 visits to the main commercial
poultry and/or large animal processing plants of northern
Iran, located in Mazandaran province, Iran. In addition, the
chicken, turkey, duck, and ﬁsh (S. trutta) meat samples were
purchased from supermarkets or traditional markets located
in Mazandaran and Golestan provinces, Iran. Furthermore,
the raw milk samples (bulk tank milk and the ﬁlters) were
collected during 20 visits to a farm located in Mazandaran
province, Iran. Each milk sample (20 ml) was collected from
bulk tank milk using a sterile syringe. The raw milk ﬁlters
were taken aseptically from the milking lines directly after
milking process and placed into sterile whirl-pack bags.
Approximately, 25 g of meat samples (with skin except for
cattle and sheep) were collected from the breast or thigh of
the carcass by using sterile forceps and scalpel. Each sample
was tightly sealed in the sterile plastic wrap and carried to
the microbiology laboratory in special ice-ﬁlled container
within 4 hr of sampling.

Isolation and identiﬁcation of thermophilic Campylobacter

Isolation of Campylobacter species was done according
to the EN/ISO 10272-1 (2006) standard methodology28
employing slight modiﬁcation.6 Brieﬂy, the meat (25 g)
and the ﬁlter milk samples were homogenized for 2 min in
a stomacher with 225 ml buffered peptone water (Difco)
in the sterile plastic bags. Then, 10 ml of the homogenate
solution was added to 90 ml of Preston’s enrichment broth
base (HiMedia Laboratories; M899) supplemented with
Campylobacter selective supplement IV (HiMedia Labora-
tories; FD042) and 5% (v/v) deﬁbrinated sheep blood. In
addition, each milk sample (20 ml) was added to 80 ml
of the same Preston’s enrichment broth. Subsequently, all
enrichment broths were incubated for 4 h at 37°C followed
by 44 h at 42°C in a jar under a microaerophilic atmosphere
(Anaerocult C; 5% O2, 10% CO2, and 85% N2).

Thereafter, 100 ml of each enriched sample was streaked
onto the Columbia Blood Agar (HiMedia Laboratories),
supplemented with the same antibiotics and sheep blood
amount. Each plate was incubated at 42°C for 48 hr under
the same condition. The suspected colonies with small, gray,
drop-like, and shiny properties were picked from each plate
and cultured on chocolate agar plates with 5% sheep blood
for further investigation. The Campylobacter spp. isolates
were conﬁrmed by genus-speciﬁc polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) assay as developed by Linton et al.29

DNA extraction and PCR analysis

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Bacterial DNA was extracted from fresh Campylobacter
spp. isolates using the phenol–chloroform technique as pre-
viously described by Khoshbakht et al.8 Spectrophotometry
was used at 260 and 280 nm to determine the purity and
concentration of the DNA (Nanodrop 1000; Thermo Scien-
tiﬁc). Genus and multiplex species-speciﬁc PCR reactions
were performed for identiﬁcation of the genus of Campylo-
bacter, C. jejuni, and C. coli species, using primers targeted
on 16SrRNA, mapA, and ceuE genes, respectively,29–31
which are shown in Table 1. After the conﬁrmation of iso-
lates, the PCR assay was done to detect the six virulence
factors using the primers listed in Table 1.

The PCR ampliﬁcations were performed in a ﬁnal volume
of 25 ml. Each PCR reaction mixture consisted of 2 ml of the
DNA template, 2.5 ml 10 · PCR buffer (75 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 9.0, 2 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, and 20 mM [NH4]2SO4),
1 ml dNTPs (50 mM), 1 ml (1 U) Ampli Taq DNA polymerase,
and 1 ml (25 pmol) from the forward and reverse primers,
which are shown in Table 1. All materials were purchased
from CinnaGen. The ﬁnal volume of each reaction mixture
was increased to 25 ml using distilled deionized water. The
thermal cycler (MJ mini; BioRad) was adjusted under the
following conditions: the initial denaturation step at 94°C for
5 min, followed by 35 ampliﬁcation cycles of the denatur-
ation step at 94°C for 1 min, the annealing step as shown in
Table 1 for 1 min, and the extension step at 72°C for 1 min.
The ﬁnal extension step was carried out at 72°C for 10 min.
The ampliﬁed products were separated using electro-
phoresis in 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide
(0.5 mg/ml; CinnaGen). The DNA bands were photographed
using an ultraviolet transilluminator (BTS-20), and the 100-
bp DNA ladder (CinnaGen) was used as a molecular size
marker. The C. jejuni RTCC 1097 and C. coli RTCC 1113
strains were included as PCR-positive controls. The sterile
PCR water was used as a negative control.

The Campylobacter spp. isolates were examined for an-
timicrobial susceptibility by employing the Kirby–Bauer
disk diffusion method. The inhibition zone was determined
with calipers and interpreted according to the Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). In the cases when
CLSI recommendations were not available for Campylo-
bacters, the CLSI guidelines for Enterobacteriaceae were
followed.32 Ten antibiotic discs (Paramedical) were used in
this research. The discs and their concentrations consisted of
ciproﬂoxacin (5 mg), enroﬂoxacin (5 mg), ampicillin (10 mg),
erythromycin (15 mg), gentamicin (10 mg), streptomycin
(25 mg), tetracycline (30 mg), nalidixic acid (30 mg), amika-
cin (30 mg), and amoxicillin (20 mg). Each overnight culture
of Campylobacter spp.
isolate was suspended in sterile
normal saline and adjusted to a turbidity of 0.5 McFarland
standard. Each suspension was inoculated with a sterile swab
on the entire surface of a 150 mm diameter Mueller-Hinton
agar plate (Oxoid Ltd.) supplemented with 5% sheep blood.
The agar surface of each plate was allowed to dry for 3 min.
The antimicrobial discs were aseptically applied on the plates.
After incubation at 42°C for 48 hr under the microaerophilic
atmosphere, the inhibition zones were measured. Staphylo-
coccus aureus ATCC 12600, Escherichia coli RTCC 1161,
and C. jejuni RTCC 1097 were used as quality control strains.

Statistical analysis

The results were analyzed using the SPSS software,
version 16.1 (SPSS, Inc.). The Pearson chi-square and
Fisher’s exact two-tailed tests were used to assess the fol-
lowing items: the association between the different isolation
rates of two Campylobacter species and type of food sam-
ples, the proportions of isolates resistant to different anti-
microbial agents, and the prevalence of the virulence factors
in isolates with various origins. p Value was lower than 0.05

indicating the signiﬁcant statistic. The logistic regression
analysis was also used to study the effect of an antibiotic
resistance on another antibiotic resistance and/or the effect
of the existence of a virulence gene on other genes. The
relationships between antibiotic resistance and virulence
genes were also analyzed using the Cramer’s V method.

Results

meat with Campylobacter spp. in the samples of after 24-hr
chilling at 4°C step was lower than the samples of after ﬁnal
wash step obtained from the slaughterhouse. Pearson chi-
square test highlighted the efﬁcacy of the chilling step in
decreasing the rate of Campylobacter spp. infection in all
the slaughterhouse samples ( p < 0.001). In addition,
the
samples that originated from the traditional market had
more Campylobacter spp. contamination.

Distribution of Campylobacter spp.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Overall, 141 (23.9%) Campylobacter spp. were isolated
from 590 samples. All
types of food origins revealed
Campylobacter spp. contamination, except for the ﬁsh
samples. The isolates of Campylobacter spp. were detected
in 40.8% (106/260) of the poultry meat, which was statis-
tically higher than the isolation rate of Campylobacter
spp.
in the red meat (14%) and milk (8.7%) samples
( p < 0.001). A summary of the Campylobacter spp. preva-
lence is shown in Table 2. Overall, among 141 isolates of
Campylobacter spp., the detection rate of C. jejuni (56%)
was higher than C. coli (29.1%), with regard to PCR
analysis. In addition, 14.9% of the isolates were other
species. Although the isolation rate of C. coli was higher
than the isolation rate of C. jejuni in the sheep and turkey
samples, the C. jejuni was signiﬁcantly detected more than
the C. coli ( p = 0.001) in others.

In the chicken samples, those which were obtained from
the traditional market had the highest prevalence of Cam-
pylobacter spp. (70%), followed by the after evisceration
step in the slaughterhouse (62%), the breast package (40%),
and the 24-hr after chilling step in the slaughterhouse (24%)
samples. Furthermore, in the turkey samples, the isolation
rate of the Campylobacter spp. was higher in the traditional
market samples (36.6%) than in the breast package samples
(22.5%). Among the red meat samples, the contamination of

C. jejuni and C. coli isolates were only tested through the
Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion assay and all of these isolates
(79 C. jejuni and 41 C. coli) were resistant to one or more
than one antimicrobial agent. The result of the antimicrobial
resistance of the isolates is summarized in Table 3. Overall,
ﬁve isolates (4.2%) were resistant to only one of the anti-
microbial agents, and 17 isolates (14.2%) showed resistance
to two antimicrobial agents. Multidrug-resistant (MDR)
isolates, which were deﬁned as a resistance to three or more
than three drugs, were found in 98 Campylobacter spp. iso-
lates (81.6%). On the other hand, the occurrence of MDR
isolates in C. coli isolates (90.2%) was generally more than
C. jejuni isolates (77.2%). Resistance to ciproﬂoxacin was
the most common of all (82.5%), followed by tetracycline
(79.2%) and nalidixic acid (75.8%). The lowest antimicro-
bial resistance (2.5%) was observed for gentamicin.

A separate evaluation of the differences in resistance to
an antibiotic in different isolation sources revealed no sta-
tistically signiﬁcant difference ( p > 0.05) except for the
isolates obtained from sheep. Resistance to streptomycin in
these sheep isolates was signiﬁcantly higher than resistance
to streptomycin in other isolates ( p < 0.001). There was no
signiﬁcant difference in the rate of antimicrobial resistance
between C. coli and C. jejuni isolates ( p > 0.05). The logis-
tic regression showed a statistical correlation between

resistances to some antibiotics. Increase in resistance to
amoxicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, and gentamicin lead
to an increase in resistance to ampicillin ( p = 0.0001), na-
lidixic acid ( p = 0.007), amikacin ( p = 0.024), and amikacin
( p = 0.036), respectively.

Detection of the virulence genes

isolates,

The prevalence of the six putative virulence genes in two
thermophilic Campylobacter species is shown in Table 4.
Among 120 Campylobacter spp.
including 79
C. jejuni and 41 C. coli, the prevalence of waaC, ciaB, and
pldA genes was 91.7%, 86.7%, and 80.8%, respectively. In
addition, lower rates of occurrence were found for cgtB
(45%) and wlaN (26.7%) markers. The plasmid-associated
virulence marker, virB11 gene, was not detected in isolates.
waaC was the most prevalent gene in C. jejuni (100%)
followed by ciaB gene (91.1%), whereas in C. coli, the most
prevalent gene was ciaB gene (78%) followed by waaC
gene (75.6%). The occurrence of wlaN and cgtB genes, in-
volved in LOS synthesis, varied in two thermophilic Cam-
pylobacter isolates. wlaN and cgtB genes were not observed
in the same isolate, simultaneously. The logistic regression
showed that the presence of the pldA gene can decrease the
presence of the cgtB gene ( p = 0.034).

No strong correlation was observed between resistance
to antibiotics and the presence of the virulence genes sur-
veyed in this research, using the Cramer’s V analysis. Only,
weak relationships were observed between the tetracycline
and pldA gene (0.18), streptomycin and pldA gene (0.2),
ampicillin and cgtB gene (0.19), and enroﬂoxacin and wlaN
gene (0.17).

Discussion

The results of this study indicated that the poultry meat,
especially the chicken meat, is the main source of Campy-
lobacter species followed by red meat and raw milk sam-
ples. In general,
these results were consistent with the
ﬁndings of previous studies on poultry meat, red meat, and
raw milk. Panzenhagen et al. isolated Campylobacter spp.
in 45% of the poultry carcasses in Brazil.33 In addition,
Kashoma et al. showed the contamination of Campylobacter
spp. in 9.5% of beef carcasses in Tanzania.15 Furthermore, a
low rate of contamination (2.91%) was also reported in milk
samples.34 However, many studies suggested that there are
variations in the Campylobacter spp. contamination rates
among countries. Economou et al. isolated Campylobacter
spp. in 29% of chicken meat samples in Greece,35 whereas
Wei et al. observed a high frequency of Campylobacter
spp. contamination (80.1%) in South Korea.5 Jamali et al.,
and Zendehbad et al. suggested that these differences could
be due to the variations in geographical and seasonal factors,
type and number of the samples, isolation methods, trans-
port conditions, and different sanitary conditions on farms
and slaughterhouses36,37; therefore, ﬁnding a direct corre-
lation among various studies might be difﬁcult. No Cam-
pylobacter spp. contamination was detected in the ﬁsh
samples in this study. This result might be due to the tem-
perature of the water that is not favorable for thermophilic
Campylobacters.

The results showed that the poultry meat obtained from
the traditional markets frequently was much contaminated

with Campylobacters than the meat package samples. It
should also be noted that poultry meat in the traditional
market can become more contaminated during the manual
slaughter of poultry–more commonly during the eviscera-
tion stage–as the carcasses of the poultry are polluted with
intestinal microorganisms. In addition, the water, which is
used in these types of markets, is almost unhygienic water
and Campylobacters can easily be circulated in this envi-
ronment and spread on the surface of carcasses.10,38 Using
the chlorinated water, increasing health condition, and de-
creasing the temperature (freezing and chilling) can signif-
icantly reduce carcass contamination. These factors are
more observed in the large-scale slaughterhouse.38,39

In addition, as it was expected, the C. jejuni was the pre-
dominant species in this research and this was consistent with
several studies.33,37,39 However, an increased occurrence of
the C. coli was observed in the sheep isolates in this research.
This difference could be due to different husbandry systems.
Most sheep herds are grazing in the pasture and this type of
husbandry system increases exposure to multiple sources of
contamination.40 In this case, the environmental sources like
natural water ponds can be polluted with swine and boar
wastes and slurries. C. coli is one of the most common
Campylobacter species that was found in these animals,40
hence, it can be concluded that pasture grazing increases the
C. coli contamination in sheep. Further ecosystem studies are
required to determine the reason for this result.

These results revealed a high frequency of Campylo-
bacter spp. resistance to ciproﬂoxacin,
tetracycline, and
nalidixic acid. These high levels of resistances have also
been reported in other studies, especially over the last few
years.1,33,36,37 Because of an extensive use of these antibi-
otics for treatment, control and prevention of diseases at the
farm,
the selection, and development of antimicrobial-
resistant Campylobacters can occur.5,36 Furthermore, some
studies have suggested that the mutation in gyrA, a gene that
encodes the DNA gyrase subunit A, is a reason for ﬂuoroq-
uinolones and nalidixic acid resistance. The widespread
use of these antibiotics can also increase the rate of gyrA
mutation in the Campylobacters.41

Campylobacter spp. can produce beta-lactamases by
blaOXA-61, blaOXA-184, and blaOXA-193. In addition, they can
use two major efﬂux systems, known as the CmeABC and
CmeDEF efﬂux pump, so they can be resistant to penicillin,
amoxicillin, and ampicillin.15,42,43 The moderate resistance to
amoxicillin and ampicillin was observed in this research,
which reﬂects this point.

The results showed a higher rate of resistance to strepto-
mycin in isolates obtained from sheep compared to other
isolates ( p < 0.001). Streptomycin in combination with peni-
cillin (like Pen-strep) is one of the most important drug
choices for treatment of pneumonia and other diseases in
animals and it is widely used In Iran, especially in the sheep
industry. So, the Campylobacters with the property of resis-
tance to penicillin can also be resistant to streptomycin and,
thereby, can be selected and spread in the sheep isolates.

Because these isolates can circulate throughout different
food animals and ﬁnally is transferred to humans, high re-
sistance to different groups of antibiotics in Campylobacter
spp. isolates is alarming and important. In addition, these
antibiotics, for example, ciproﬂoxacin, are considered the
drugs of choice for treating human campylobacteriosis;
hence, the increased resistance of such strains poses a public
health problem.15 Low resistances to gentamicin, amikacin,
and erythromycin were observed in this study. The low re-
sistance to these antibiotics could be due to the fact that
these antibiotics are rarely used in Iran.37

This study indicated the high level of MDR in Campy-
lobacter spp. isolates. Furthermore, the presence of MDR
isolates was more detected in the C. coli isolates than the
C. jejuni isolates. Other authors have also found the same
ﬁnding and suggested that the C. coli strains could acquire
horizontal resistance genes better than the C. jejuni isolates
and/or those target genes could mutate faster in the C. coli
isolates than in the C. jejuni strains.4,36,37 However, there
are a number of reasons related to the mechanism of MDR
in Campylobacters. The presence of a major efﬂux system,
as mentioned above, is responsible for resistance to a broad
range of antibiotics. Destruction or inactivation of antibi-
otics (by enzymes encoded by chromosomal or plasmid

CAMPYLOBACTER CONTAMINATION IN FOOD

genes) and low-level access of antimicrobial agents to their
targets are the other reasons.42

The results of this research showed a correlation between
isolates and resistance to two antibiotics. Whenever an
isolate was resistant to an antibiotic (like amoxicillin), the
chance of resistance to another antibiotic from the same
family (like ampicillin) was higher. It is thus evident that
more antibiotic resistance mechanisms are common in a
family of antibiotics. For example, if one isolate of C. jejuni
can produce class D b-lactamase, it can be resistant to
amoxicillin and ampicillin, simultaneously.40 It should be
mentioned that further experimental evidence is needed to
support this conclusion. Decreasing and selecting a better
combination of antibiotics for treatment and growth factor in
the food-producing animals can be key points for controlling
the important issue of antibiotic resistance in the world.1

Concerning the safety of consumers and the importance
of health control program of campylobacteriosis, it is nec-
essary to investigate the virulence properties of Campylo-
bacter spp. as potentially pathogenic bacteria.8 The high
occurrence of pldA and ciaB genes was observed in this
study. Similar to the results of this research, Feodoroff et al.
detected the pldA and ciaB genes in 61% and 98% of iso-
lates.44 Moreover, Datta et al. reported a high prevalence of
pldA gene (88%–100%)
in isolates obtained from the
broilers.45 In an earlier study in Iran, Khoshbakht et al.
detected 91.7% of positive isolates for the pldA gene in
isolates from poultry feces.8 However, in contrast to this
approach, a low frequency of pldA gene was observed in a
study on sheep and cattle in Iran.9 In agreement with the
results of other studies,8,9,46 the plasmid-associated viru-
lence marker, virB11 gene, was not present in any of the
isolates in this research. In some other studies, this gene was
identiﬁed in a very low rate of the tested isolates.18,19 The
nature of the virB11 plasmid and geographical differences
may be the reason.8

The three LOS-associated genes, wlaN, cgtB, and waaC,
were also examined in this study. The high frequency of
waaC (91.7%) was found in Campylobacter isolates. In
addition, a moderate prevalence of wlaN and cgtB genes was
observed. wlaN and cgtB genes produce b-1, 3 galactosyl-
transferase and along with waaC gene are connected with
the Guillain-Barre’ and Miller-Fischer syndromes.23,24 wlaN
and cgtB genes were not observed in isolates, simulta-
neously. Mu¨ller et al. discussed the same results.46 They
inversely demonstrated that the presence of cgtB and wlaN
in the Campylobacter spp. could be due to a speciﬁc func-
tion of b-1, 3 galactosyltransferases during colonization and
invasion processes. However, further in vitro and in vivo
investigations are required to prove this theory and elucidate
the role of virulence genes in the pathogenesis of Campy-
lobacter spp. infections.

The results obtained from this research showed no cor-
relation between the prevalence of the virulence genes and
the Campylobacter species. In addition, using the Cramer’s
V analysis, no strong correlation was observed between
resistance to antibiotics and the presence of virulence
genes, which was similar to the results of other studies.
Ghunaim et al. detected some interactions between ciaB
gene and the expression of antimicrobial resistance to ci-
proﬂoxacin and erythromycin.25 However, they also ob-
served no signiﬁcant correlation between them. Anyway,

further genetic investigations are needed to prove the re-
lationship between virulence factors and resistance to an-
timicrobial agents.

In conclusion, the results indicated that the apparently
healthy food animals, and especially poultry, are potential
sources for human campylobacteriosis. In addition, the re-
sults showed that the Campylobacter spp. contamination
in the ﬁsh products is rare. However, the majority of the
Campylobacter spp. isolates obtained in this study were MDR
and had putative virulence genes. These data are alarming
and raise public health concern, and increase the attention to
the widespread use of antibiotics. Hence, to decrease con-
tamination of meat, it is necessary to apply good hygienic
standards and food safety assurance programs in the entire
slaughtering process and milk bulk centers. Also, effective
criteria should be implemented to reduce using antibiotics in
the veterinary industry.
