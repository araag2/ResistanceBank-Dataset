Abstract  

 

Multidrug-resistance  (MDR)  has  been  increasingly  reported  in  Gram-negative  bacteria 

from  the  intestinal  microbiota,  environment  and  food-producing  animals.  Resistance 

plasmids  able  to  harbour  different  transposable  elements  are  capable  to  mobilize 

antimicrobial  resistance  genes  and  transfer  to  other  bacterial  hosts.  Plasmids  carrying 

blaCMY are frequently associated with MDR. The present study assessed the presence of 

plasmid-encoded ampC genes (blacmy, blamox, blafox, blalat, blaact, blamir, bladha, blamor) in 

commensal  E.  coli  isolated  from  apparently  healthy  broiler  chickens.  Furthermore,  we 

characterized  the  plasmids  and  identified  those  harboring  the  resistance  genes.  We 

isolated  144/200  (72%)  of  E.  coli  isolates  with  resistance  to  cefotaxime  and  the 

resistance  gene  identified  was  blaCMY-2.  The  pulsed-field  gel  electrophoresis  (PFGE) 

analysis showed high diversity of the genetic profiles. The phylogenetic groups A, B1, 

B2 and D were  identified  among E. coli isolates  and group D was the most  prevalent. 

The  PCR-based  replicon  typing  (PBRT)  analysis  identified  four  distinct  plasmid 

incompatibility groups (Inc) in MDR isolates.  Moreover, plasmids harbouring blaCMY-2, 

ranged in size from 50kb to 150kb and 51/144 (35%) belonged to IncK, 21/144 (14.5%) 

to  IncB/O,  8/144  (5.5%)  to  IncA/C,  1/144  (0.5%)  to  IncI,  while  63/144  (44.5%)  were 

not  typeable  by  PBRT.  Overall,  a  high  prevalence  of  blaCMY-2  genes  was  found  in  a 

diverse  population  of  commensal  MDR  E.  coli  from  poultry  in  Brazil,  harboured  into 

different plasmids.

1. Introduction 

 

The  use  of  antibiotics  for  prevention  or  treatment  of  gastrointestinal  infections 

and  as  growth  promoters  in  food-producing  animals  results  in  selective  pressure  for 

commensal microbiota and pathogens in the gut environment. Commensal Escherichia 

coli  have  shown  a  high  capability  to  acquire  and  carry  genes  and  mobile  genetic 

elements  (MGE)  involved  in  antimicrobial  resistance.  Moreover,  commensal  E.  coli 

also  have  the  ability  to  harbor  resistance  genes  and  disseminate  to  other  bacteria  (da 

Costa et al., 2013). 

 Overexpression of intrinsic chromosomal ampC gene and high levels of AmpC 

protein may confer resistance to penicillin, third generation cephalosporins, β-lactamase 

inhibitor  associated  with  β-lactams  and  cephamycins  (Pfeifer  et  al.,  2010).  In  E.  coli, 

increased  expression  of  the  intrinsic  ampC  gene  depends  on  mutations  of  promoter 

genes  (Pfeifer  et  al.,  2010).  However 

,the  extended  spectrum  resistance 

to 

cephalosporins  generally  occurs  due  to  extended  spectrum  β-lactamase  (ESBL) 

production or acquisition of plasmid-borne ampC β-lactamase (pAmpC) genes (Pfeifer 

et al., 2010).  pAmpC have been isolated in E. coli and Salmonella from food-producing 

animals in many countries, becoming well adapted to these bacterial reservoirs (Liebana 

et  al.,  2013);  (Jacoby,  2009).  In  Brazil,  blaCMY-2  gene  is  rarely  identified  in  human 

clinical  isolates  (Rocha  et  al.,  2015),  and  was  never  reported  in  live  food-producing 

animals, only in retail poultry meat (Botelho et al., 2015).  

The  survival  of  E.  coli  during  antimicrobial  therapy  can  occur  by  the  complex 

interaction  of  different  mechanisms  that  confer  resistance  to  different  classes  of 

antibiotics  at  the  same  time.  This  mechanism  include  drug  efflux  pump,  enzymatic 

degradation    of  the  antibiotic  (e.g.  β-lactamases)  or  protection  of  antimicrobial  target 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

 

protein  (type  II  DNA  topoisomerases)  from  quinolones,  by  qnr  genes  proteins 

(Rodriguez-Martinez et al., 2011, Szmolka and Nagy, 2013).  

Resistance genes involved with enzymatic inactivation are frequently associated 

with  MGE  (Ferreira  et  al.,  2016).  Thus,  the  transferability  capacity  is  higher,  which 

facilitates 

the  dissemination  of 

resistance  among  E.  coli  and  even  other 

Enterobacteriaceae (Liebana et al., 2013). 

Among  the  MGE,  plasmids  have  been  described  as  the  most  efficient  tool 

involved  in  the  acquisition  and  dissemination  of  antimicrobial  resistance  genes  in 

Enterobacteriaceae.  The  role  of  plasmids  in  the  dissemination  and  maintenance  of 

resistance  genes  among  multidrug-resistant  bacteria  (MDR)  has  been  increasingly 

demonstrated by different studies (Fernandez-Alarcon et al., 2011, Hiki et al., 2013, Li 

et  al.,  2007).  These  elements  are  well  adapted  to  the  respective  bacterial  hosts. 

Conveniently  selected  by  the  progeny  due  to  the  abusive  use  of  antimicrobials, 

resistance  plasmids  interfere  on  the  efficacy  of  therapies,  hampering  the  control  of 

MDR  bacteria  (Canton  and  Ruiz-Garbajosa,  2011,  Carattoli,  2013,  Livermore,  2012). 

Different  families  of  plasmids  have  been  identified,  although  epidemiological  data 

shows  a  variable  frequency  of  dissemination.  Some  families,  such  as  IncI1,  IncHI1, 

IncN and  IncA/C have been associated to MDR  pathogens. Their efficient conjugative 

system  and  broad  host  range,  contribute  to  the  dissemination  in  commensal  and 

pathogenic bacteria (Carattoli, 2013, Liebana et al., 2013).  

Thus, 

the  present  study  assessed 

the  presence  of  extended  spectrum 

cephalosporin-resistant  E.  coli,  pAmpC  genes,  determined  the  size  and  Inc  group  of 

plasmids-carrying  ampC  genes  and  evaluated  the  population  structure  of  pAmpC-

producing E. coli in the commensal microbiota of apparently healthy broiler chickens.

2. Material and methods 

2.1. Isolates 

 

 

Two-hundred  cloacal  swabs  were  obtained  from  commercial  broilers  in  two 

poultry farms from São Paulo State, Brazil, from 2011 to 2012. Cloacal swab samples 

were streaked on MacConkey  (MC) agar  containing cefotaxime (1µg/mL) and on MC 

agar with ceftazidime (1µg/mL), incubated at 37°C for 24h. One colony from each plate 

containing cefotaxime was selected to conduct the present study. The bacterial colonies 

were  identified  by  classical  biochemical  methods  and  confirmed  by  API  20E  system 

(bioMérieux, France). 

 

2.2. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing  

 

The  antimicrobial  susceptibility  of  the  isolates  were  determined  by  using  the 

disk  diffusion  methods  (CLSI,  2012),  and  the  results  were  interpreted  according  to 

recommendations  of  the  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards  Institute  (CLSI,  2013), 

document  M100-S23.  Fifteen  antimicrobial  agents  were  tested,  including  β-lactam 

antibiotics:  amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid 

(AMC),  piperacillin/tazobactam 

(TZP), 

cefotaxime  (CTX),  ceftazidime  (CAZ),  cefoxitin  (FOX),  cefepime  (FEP),  aztreonam 

(ATM),  ertapenem  (ETP)  and,  non  β-lactam  antibiotics:  nalidixic  acid  (NAL), 

ciprofloxacin  (CIP),  levofloxacin  (LEV),  tetracycline  (TET),  gentamicin  (GEN), 

trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT) and chloramphenicol (CHL).  

 

2.3. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and phylogenetic analysis 

 

Genetic  relationship  among  isolates  was  determined  using  analysis  of  XbaI-

digested  genomic  DNA  followed  by  PFGE,  performed  in  CHEF  DRIII  System  (Bio-

Rad,  USA),  as  previously  described  (CDC,  2004).  Profiles  were  analysed  with  the 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

 

BioNumerics fingerprinting software v 5.0 (Applied Maths, Belgium). The normalized 

profiles  were  compared  using  the  Dice  similarity  coefficient  and  the  dendrogram  was 

constructed  with  the  unweighted-pair  group  method  using  arithmetic  average  linkage 

algorithm (UPGMA). The homology cutoff value of 85% was used to group the related 

isolates within the same PFGE-type. 

 

The  phylogenetic  groups  were  assigned  by  PCR,  according  to  previously 

described  method  (Clermont  et  al.,  2000).  Briefly,  this  method  characterizes  the 

phylogenetic groups (A, B1, B2, or D) of each E. coli isolate based on the presence of 

chuA, yjaA genes and TSPE4.C2 DNA fragment. 

 

2.4. Detection of plasmid-mediated ampC genes  

 

The investigation of blacmy, blamox, blafox, blalat, blaact, blamir, bladha, blamor, genes 

was  carried  out  by  PCR  (D'Andrea  et  al.,  2006).  Purified  PCR  amplicons  (illustra™ 

GFX™ PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit, GE Healthcare, USA) were directly 

sequenced  using 

the  ABI  3730  DNA  Analyser 

(Life  Technologies-Applied 

Biosystems).  The  DNA  sequences  and  translated  amino  acid  sequences  obtained  were 

compared  with 

reference 

sequences 

from 

the  LAHEY 

home 

page 

(http://www.lahey.org/Studies/). 

 

2.5. Characterization of plasmid replicon typing and genomic localization 

 

After PCR and DNA sequencing, isolates carrying pAmpC genes were selected 

for investigation and characterization of resistance plasmids. PCR-based replicon typing 

(PBRT) method was used as previously described  (Carattoli et  al.,  2005) to  search for 

major plasmid incompatibility (Inc) groups among  field E. coli isolates. Plasmid DNA 

was  digested  with  S1  nuclease  and  analysed  on  PFGE  gels  (S1-PFGE).  Southern  blot 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

 

and  hybridizations  were  performed  as  described  previously  (Sambrook  et  al.,  1989) 

using specific probes to locate the plasmid carrying the resistance gene. with .  

 

2.6. Conjugation experiments 

 

Transferability of plasmids carrying ampC β-lactamase genes was determined by 

conjugation  using  as  recipient  strain  the  E.  coli  K12  C600,  which  is  streptomycin 

resistant,  lactose  negative,  and  plasmid  free.  Transconjugants  were  selected  on 

MacConkey  agar  containing  2  µg/mL  of  cefotaxime  and  300  µg/mL  of  streptomycin. 

The  presence  of  acquired  ampC  genes  in  the  transconjugants  was  confirmed  by  PCR. 

Inc groups of resistance plasmids from transconjugants were assigned using the PBRT 

method. 

 

3. Results and Discussion 

Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in commensal Enterobacteriaceae has a 

critical  impact  to  evaluate  the  presence  and  the  prevalence  of  MDR  bacteria  and 

resistance  genes  in  the  microbiota  of  food-producing  animals  (Szmolka  and  Nagy, 

2013). The inappropriate use of antimicrobials in food-producing animals concerns the 

food  safety  authorities.  Commensal  bacteria  found  in  gastrointestinal  tract  of  farm 

animals may cause extraintestinal infections or  serve as reservoirs for resistance  genes 

that could potentially be transferred to pathogenic organisms. The concept of “farm-to-

fork” involves the risk of dissemination of pathogens through the food chain (Liebana et 

al., 2013). Although there is little evidence  reported up to now (Huijbers et al., 2014), 

this  concept  may  also  be  applicable  to  commensal  MDR  bacteria  considering  the 

increasing prevalence found in livestock.  MDR bacteria present in raw meat and even 

processed  food,  may  contaminate  humans  through  handling  and  consumption  of  these 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

 

products,  offering  risk  to  public  health  when  colonizing  the  community  or  causing 

foodborne infections (Botelho et al., 2015, Landers et al., 2012).  

In  the  present  study,  144  E.  coli  isolates  resistant  to  cefotaxime  (CTX)  were 

obtained  from  the  culture  of  200  different  samples  of  cloacal  swabs.  Additionally, 

isolates  resistant  to  CTX  also  showed  resistance  to  other  β-lactams  tested,  including 

100% (144/144) resistance to AMC and 84% (121/144) to CAZ. Resistance to FOX was 

present  in  90%  (130/144)  and  to  ATM  was  found  in  55%  (80/144)  of  the  isolates. 

However, only  4% (6/144) of these isolates showed resistance to TZP and 100% were 

susceptible  to  FEP  and  ETP.    Furthermore,  99%  (143/144)  of  the  isolates  were  also 

resistant to the non-beta-lactam antibiotics NAL and CIP, 97% (140/144) to LEV, 75% 

(108/144) to  TET,  50%  (73/144) to  GEN, 35%  (50/144) to  SXT  and  24% (34/144)  to 

CHL  (Table 1).  

Thus,  all  144  isolates  were  considered  MDR,  not-susceptible  to  at  least  one 

agent in three or more antimicrobial categories (Magiorakos et al., 2012). Moreover, the 

PCR  and  DNA  sequencing  showed  that  all  these  isolates  carried  the  resistance  gene 

blaCMY-2. E. coli carrying pAmpC genes are usually co-resistant to other commonly used 

antimicrobial  agents  (Liebana  et  al.,  2013).  The  persistence  and  dissemination  of 

pAmpC-producing  isolates  in  food-producing  animals  may  be  aggravated  by  the 

prophilatic  use  of  cephalosporins.  Co-resistance  phenotypes  are  also  involved  in  the 

maintenance  of  resistance  genes  and  plasmids  in  E.  coli,  (Gouvêa  et  al.,  2015),  thus 

other antimicrobials frequently used, such as fluoroquinolones, may also play a role in 

the selection of MDR isolates in the animal environment  (Canton and Ruiz-Garbajosa, 

2011, Szmolka and Nagy, 2013). 

 The  distribution  of  phylogenetic  groups  has  been  suggested  to  be  related  with 

health  status  or  geographical  region  of  each  host  species  analysed  (Asai  et  al.,  2011). 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

 

The E. coli phylogenetic group D was the most prevalent, containing 60% (87/144) of 

the  isolates,  30%  (43/144)  were  assigned  to  the  phylogenetic  group  A,  6%  (8/144)  of 

the  isolates  belonged  to  phylogenetic  group  B2  and  4%  (6/144)  belonged  to 

phylogenetic  group  B1  (Table  1).  Similar  results  were  previously  described  on  E.  coli 

harbouring  blaCMY-2  isolated  from  retail  chicken  meat  in  Brazil  (Botelho  et  al.,  2015). 

Phylogenetic group D and B2 are associated virulent extra-intestinal E. coli (Clermont 

et  al.,  2000).  Thus,  MDR  E.  coli  harbouring  blaCMY-2  from  both  these  phylogenetic 

groups  may  have  the  capacity  to  cause  extra-intestinal  infections,  representing  higher 

risk, in such cases when treatment is difficult.    

The  clonal  dissemination  of  antimicrobial  resistance  has  been  reported, 

highlighting  the  capability  of  resistant  strains  to  prevail  in  different  environments, 

especially  communities  or  hospitals  (Liebana  et  al.,  2013).  However,  in  the  present 

work,  among  144  E.  coli  isolates  carrying  blaCMY-2,  75  different  PFGE-types  were 

found,  classified  within  21  clusters  (Table  1).  Thus,  we  show  a  non-clonal  E.  coli 

population carrying the same resistance gene or even the same resistance plasmid (Table 

1). The combination of a rich microbiological environment and the selective pressure in 

current poultry production systems, caused by measures such as the use of antibiotics in 

the  animal  feed,  might  contribute  for  the  successful  establishment  of  a  diverse 

population of MDR bacteria.  

Among  144  CTX-resistant  isolates,  all  harboured  blaCMY-2,  a  remarkable  high 

rate  of  this  gene  in  broilers.  In  Europe,  blaCMY-2  is  the  most  prevalent  pAmpC  gene 

(Liebana  et  al.,  2013).  However,  in  Brazil,  presence  of  this  gene  is  rarely  reported  in 

clinical  isolates,  thus  the  continuous  surveillance  is  extremely  important  to  prevent 

environmental dissemination or maintenance of this resistance gene in hospital bacteria 

(Campana  et  al.,  2013,  Rocha  et  al.,  2015).  Recently,  this  gene  was  reported  in  retail 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

 

chicken  meat  in  Brazil  (Botelho  et  al.,  2015,  Mattiello  et  al.,  2015).  However,  the 

present study reports for the first time the disseminated blaCMY-2 in commensal E. coli 

isolates  from  the  microbiota  of  live  healthy  poultry  in  Brazil.  Together,  these  results 

show  an  important  concern  to  the  public  and  animal  health.  The  high  prevalence  of 

these  MDR  bacteria  in  the  animal  environment  and  retail  meat  may  represent  risk  of 

dissemination to the human environment. 

Resistance  plasmids  carrying  blaCMY-2  belonged  to  four  distinct  Inc  groups 

corresponding to 51 (35%) from IncK, 21 (14.5%) from IncB/O, 8 (5.5%) from IncA/C 

and  one  (0.5%)  from  IncI,  while  63  (44.5%)  plasmids  were  non-typeable  by  PBRT 

(Table 1). As shown by the S1-PFGE, plasmids harbouring blaCMY-2 ranged in size from 

50kb  to  150kb.  However,  the  large  size  did  not  prevent  the  resistance  plasmids  to  be 

conjugative. These were successfully transferred to E. coli K12 C600, conferring CTX 

resistance to this strain. The conjugative ability of resistance plasmids increases the risk 

of  successful  dissemination  to  other  bacterial  hosts.  Thus,  commensal  E.  coli  carrying 

these  MGE  may  be  capable  to  transfer  the  resistance  plasmids  to  pathogens  in  the 

microbiota, such as Salmonella (Winokur et al., 2001). 

The  dissemination  of  pAmpC  gene  in  both  humans  and  animals  has  been 

associated to the IncF, IncI, IncN, IncA/C, IncL/M, and IncK plasmid families (Liebana 

et  al.,  2013).  Plasmids  co-harbouring  multidrug-resistance  determinants  are  usually 

large  (>50  kb),  self-conjugative,  and  may  encode  resistance  to  all  main  antimicrobial 

classes  used  in  therapies,  including  β-lactams,  quinolones,  fluoroquinolones  and 

tetracyclines.  Moreover,  these  plasmids  are  highly  efficient  in  acquisition  and 

transmission of most resistance genes (Carattoli, 2013).   

The  Inc  groups  of  plasmids  identified  in  this  study  have  been  previously 

associated  with  CMY-2-producing  Enterobacteriaceae  worldwide  (Hiki  et  al.,  2013, 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

 

Voets et al., 2013), but never described in isolates from Brazil. In 2010, IncI1 and IncK 

plasmids  harbouring  blaCMY-2  were  detected  in  live  poultry  and  hospital  patients  in 

Netherlands (Dierikx et al., 2010). The same plasmid replicons were later described in 

isolates from retail poultry meat in the same country in 2013, suggesting the association 

between  these  isolates  (Voets  et  al.,  2013).  In  Japan,  the  presence  of  IncB/O  carrying 

blaCMY-2 in E. coli from livestock animals was recently described for the first time (Hiki 

et al., 2013). IncA/C plasmid replicon has been associated with the spread of blaCMY-2 in 

E. coli and Salmonella spp. isolated from humans in the United States (Carattoli, 2009). 

Furthermore,  plasmids  harbouring  blaCMY-2  frequently  harbour  other  resistance  genes 

associated to different antimicrobial classes (Hiki et al., 2013), increasing the spectrum 

of resistance. In Australia, the replicons IncI1 and IncF were identified carrying blaCMY-

2  in  E.  coli,  however  IncI1  was  predominant  in  this  country,  present  in  96%  of  the 

isolates (Sidjabat et al., 2014, Tagg et al., 2015).  According to our findings, IncK was 

the most frequent plasmid typeable by PBRT, carrying the gene blaCMY-2 in different E. 

coli  PFGE-types.  These  results  may  suggest  a  higher  conjugation  and  dissemination 

capacity  of  this  replicon,  and  further  studies  may  also  identify  this  replicon  in  CTX 

resistant isolates from Brazil.  

Plasmid-mediated AmpC in  E.  coli  from  retail  chicken meat  was found  for the 

first time in 2015 in Brazil (Botelho et al., 2015). In Europe, Asia and United States, E. 

coli  carrying  blaCMY-2  has  already  been  reported  in  food-producing  animals,  however 

the prevalence in the United States is high, in both food-producing animals and humans 

(Carattoli, 2008, Hiki et al., 2013, Winokur et al., 2001). In Brazil, there are no reports 

characterizing  the  plasmids  Inc  groups  carrying  blaCMY-2  in  human  clinical  isolates.  In 

this  study,  only  IncA/C  plasmids  carrying  blaCMY-2  were  identified  in  E.  coli  isolates 

from  phylogenetic  group  B2,  usually  characterized  as  the  most  virulent  in  comparison 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 

 

with other groups. These findings brought new knowledge involving the dissemination 

of  blaCMY-2  in  live  poultry  from  farms  in  Brazil.  Although  there  is  little  evidence  of 

dissemination through the food chain,  farm  workers in  animal  production  facilities are 

exposed  to  higher  risks  of  contamination  by  MDR  E.  coli  of  animal  origin,  which  is 

another via of community colonization (da Costa et al., 2013).  

E.  coli  are  efficient  hosts,  capable  to  receive  and  disseminate  resistance  to 

antimicrobials,  through  resistance  determinants,  associated  to  MGE  that  can  be 

horizontally transferred. Furthermore, these bacteria have high potential to harbour and 

become reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance genes (da Costa et al., 2013).  Overall our 

results  show  a  high  rate  (72%)  of  blaCMY-2  disseminated  by  different  plasmid  replicon 

types,  in  a  diverse  commensal  E.  coli  population.  These  findings,  taken  together  with 

other  recent  studies  worldwide,  demonstrate  the  disseminated  resistance  to  third 

generation  cephalosporins  in  apparently  healthy  food-producing  animals,  which  may
