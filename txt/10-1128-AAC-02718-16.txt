2  Abstract 23 The detection and rapid spread of colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae carrying the mcr-1 gene 24 has created an urgent need to strengthen surveillance. In this study, eight clonally unrelated 25 colistin-resistant Escherichia coli isolates carrying mcr-1, and blaCTX-M or blaCMY-2 genes, were 26 isolated from commercial chicken meat in Brazil. Most E. coli carried IncX4 plasmids, 27 previously identified in human and animal isolates. These results highlight a new reservoir of 28 mcr-1-harboring E. coli in South America. 29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45 l

3  Text 46 The detection and rapid spread of colistin-resistant Escherichia coli isolates carrying the mcr-1 47 gene has created an urgent need to strengthen surveillance. Nowadays, mcr-1-harboring 48 Enterobacteriaceae isolates have been identified in food-producing animals, foods, aquatic 49 environments, and humans (1-12). Although, the mcr-1 gene has spread rapidly in Asia, Europe, 50 Africa, North America and South America, studies reporting its presence in Enterobacteriaceae 51 from foods have been unfrequent. In this regard, mcr-1-positive E. coli have been described in 52 meats or vegetables in Europe (4-7, 9-11), Asia (8) and North America (12), so far. In this study, 53 we report for the first time the identification of colistin-resistant E. coli carrying the mcr-1 gene 54 in commercial chicken meat, in Latin America. 55 As part of a local investigation conducted for monitoring the presence of colistin-resistant 56 bacteria, carrying mcr-1, in chicken meat sold in markets in São Paulo, southeastern Brazil, forty-57 one samples including breasts (n= 20), thighs (n= 20), and liver (n= 1) were collected from 12 58 markets, between August and October of 2016. Samples (25 g) were dispensed in sterile plastic 59 bags (Whirl-Pak, Nasco, WI, USA) containing 225 ml of MacConkey broth and incubated at 60 37°C for 24 h. After incubation, an aliquot of 1 ml of MacConkey broth was serially diluted on 61 buffered peptone water and inoculated onto MacConkey agar plates containing colistin (2 µg/ml) 62 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), being incubated at 37°C for 24 h (13). Next, antimicrobial 63 susceptibility profiles and MIC values of polymyxin B and colistin were determined by disc 64 diffusion (14) and microdilution method (15), respectively, and mcr-1, ESBL and pAmpC genes 65 were screened by PCR and sequencing (1, 16).  66 Eight colistin-resistant E. coli isolated from chicken meat samples (19.5%) collected from 67 markets located in the North, South, and West region of São Paulo city, were positive for mcr-1 68 l

These isolates were found to be genetically unrelated by 69 pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) (17), as well as to other mcr-1-positive E. coli isolates, 70 previously identified in food-producing animals (2) and human (3), in Brazil However, plasmid 71 characterization by PCR-based replicon typing (PBRT) (18) revealed the presence of IncX4-type 72 plasmids in five mcr-1-positive E. coli isolates (Table 1), which has been globally reported (3).  73 Genomic DNA from five representative colistin-resistant E. coli isolates (CF1.2, CF 101, 74 CF 121, CF132, CF351) was extracted to construct a Nextera XT DNA library, which was 75 sequenced using the MiSeq v3 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA), using paired-end reads 76 (300bp). De novo assembly was performed using A5-Miseq pipeline and this assembly was 77 optimized using Geneious v.R9 (Biomatters Ltd, New Zealand). Serotypes, MLST, plasmid 78 replicons, antimicrobial resistance genes, and E. coli virulence genes were identified using 79 multiple databases as SerotypeFinder 1.1, MLST 1.8, PlasmidFinder 1.3, ResFinder 2.1 and 80 VirulenceFinder 1.5 respectively, available from the Center for Genomic Epidemiology 81 (http://genomicepidemiology.org/).  82 Most E. coli isolates exhibited a MDR phenotype and, indeed, clinically important genes 83 conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, quinolones, sulphonamide and tetracyclines were 84 identified by whole genome sequencing (WGS) (Table 1). On the other hand, MLST analysis 85 from sequence reads identified the sequence types ST132, ST48, ST4419, ST522 and ST10 86 (Table 1). In particular, the ST10 has been widely identify from animal, food, human and 87 environmental samples, and associated to the production of CTX-M-type ESBLs and, more 88 recently, the MCR-1 enzyme, denoting a great versatility of this lineage for adaptation to 89 different hosts (3, 19-23). Furthermore, presence of IncX4 plasmids carrying the mcr-1 gene in E. 90 coli isolates CF1.2, CF131 and CF132 was confirmed, as previoulsy reported in human and 91 l

5  animal clinical samples collected in this region (3, 19). In this regard, contigs of 5545-kbp, 92 containing the mcr-1 gene were found to bear an IncX4 replicon signature, as determined by the 93 PlasmidFinder database (https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/PlasmidFinder/). Moreover these contigs 94 were found to host a hit showing 100% identity to another IncX4 plasmid harbouring mcr-1 95 (GenBank accession no. CP015977). Partial IncX4 plasmid sequences were deposited in the 96 GenBank database under the accession numbers: KY550358 (pCF1-2), KY550357 (pCF131) and 97 KY550359 (pCF132). CTX-M-type-encoding genes were not located in the same plasmid that 98 carried the mcr-1 gene. In fact, IncX4 plasmids have only been associated with the mobilization 99 of mcr-1 (24). 100 Colistin has been widely used in animal feed as a growth promoter in Brazilian livestock, 101 mainly in pigs and poultry. From 2008, the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Supply 102 (MAPA) has established appropriate levels for colistin use in broilers (2-10 g/tonne of feed), 103 poultry  (4-10 g/tonne of feed), pigs  (20-40 g/tonne of feed) and cattle (5-40 g/tonne of feed). 104 However, after the presence of colistin-resistant E. coli carrying the mcr-1 gene was confirmed in 105 human and animals (includying livestock), following international recommendations of the World 106 Health Organization (WHO), the use of colistin in animal feed was banned by the MAPA 107 (Regulatory Instruction no. 45) in November 2016, available at http://www.agricultura.gov.br/. 108 In summary, these results highlight that commercial chicken meat can be an important 109 reservoir of mcr-1-carrying E. coli, which is a cause for public health concern, since this could 110 contribute to the acceleration of the spread of the mcr-1 gene. In fact, in the agribusiness, Brazil 111 is the third largest chicken meat producer country and the largest exporter of this product with a 112 high domestic consumption (25). Finally, the occurrence of E. coli carrying the mcr-1 gene in 113 chicken meat could be favoured by the versatility of E. coli, regarding host adaptability, ubiquity, 114 l

So, surveillance of colistin-resistant E. coli carrying mcr-1 116 gene in the food chain needs to be established as a priority, to prevent their spread. 117  118 CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT 119 The authors have no conflict of interest to declare.   120  121 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 122 This work was supported by research grants from Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal 123 de Nível Superior (CAPES), Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP), 124 and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq).
