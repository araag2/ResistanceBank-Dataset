Present  study  was  conducted  to  determine  the  levels  of  Salmonella  spp.  mediated  contamination  in 
samples  collected  from  poultry  and  poultry  environments  in  Bangladesh  and  to  determine  the 
antibiotic resistance trait in those pathogens. A total of 300 samples were collected from five different 
sources  (cloacal  swab,  intestinal  fluid,  egg  surface,  hand  wash  of  chicken  handler  and  soil  of  chicken 
market)  and  80  (26.6%)  samples  were  found  to  be  contaminated  with  Salmonella  spp.  One  hundred 
and fifty Salmonella strains were isolated among which, 91 were detected as S. enteriditis and 59 as S. 
typhimurium  through  morphological,  biochemical  and  serological  tests.  Susceptibility  of  the    isolates 
against 13 antimicrobials was tested, and resistance against chloramphenicol (30 µg), erythromycin (15 
µg),  ampicillin  (10  µg),  riphampicin  (5  µg),  cephalexin  (15  µg),  cefixine  (5  µg),  penicillin  (10  µg), 
tetracycline (30 µg), norfloxacin (10 µg), nalidixic acid (30 µg) and ciprofloxacin (10 µg) was found in 
58%,  82%,  88%,  60%,  65%,  50%,  100%,  100%,  20%,  20%  and  20%  of  the  strains,  consecutively. 
76% isolates were found to be sensitive against gentamicin and 70% against streptomycin. Some of the 
isolates interestingly exhibited multiple-drug resistances against at least 6 to 10 antibiotics.  The results 
indicated the higher resistance of Salmonella spp. against antibiotics which serving as a threat not only 
to poultry industry of Bangladesh but also possesses a serious threat to public and animal health.

food chain (7, 8). 
 
   In  recent  times,  a  significant  increase  in  the  occurrence 
 
of antimicrobial drug resistance in Salmonella strains is of 
 
great concern in both developed and developing countries 
 
(9-11). Furthermore, the wide spread use of antimicrobials 
 
in  farm  animals  is  often  implicated  in  the  emergence  of 
multidrug-resistant  strains  of  Salmonella 
(12).  The 
 
bacterial  resistance  against  antimicrobial  agents  is  known 
 
to  be  driven  by  the  interplay  of  several  mechanistic  and 
 
epidemiologic factors including the chromosomal defects, 
 
random  mutation,  plasmid  exchange,  and  by  the  transfer 
 
of  drug  resistance  genes  by  integron  or  transposon  (13-

epidemiological study of antimicrobial resistance are in 
their  infancy  in  Bangladesh.  In  addition,  the  lack  of 
rigorous controls on antimicrobial usage, particularly in 
farm  animal  production  system  increases  the  risk  of 
pathogenic  microbes  harboring  an  array  of  resistance 
gene.  Therefore, 
this  study  was  focused  on  the 
determination of the level of Salmonella contamination 
in the poultry environments and their resistance against 
different antibiotics in Bangladesh. 
 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 

   Sampling  Area  and  Sample  Collection.  The  study  was  carried  out  during 
the  period  from  October,  2008  to  June,  2010.  Three  hundred  samples  from 
cloacal  swabs  of  chicken  (n  =  80),  intestinal  fluid  of  chicken  (n=70),  egg 
surface  (n  =  60),  soil  of  chicken  market  (n=40)  and  hand  wash  of  chicken 
handlers  (n=50)  were  collected  from  various  poultry  shops  of  4  City 
Corporation markets viz., Mohakhali, Dhaka New Market, Mirpur and Malibag 
of  the  Dhaka  metropolitan  city.  The  samples  were  collected  following  the 
procedure as stated by Akond et al., 2009 (24). 
   Transportation  of  Sample.  All  the  samples  were  transported  to  the 
laboratory  immediately  after  collection  in  an  insulating  foam  box  with  ice 
maintaining  the  temperature  ranging  from  4  C  to  6  C.  In  case  of  the  cloacal 
swab  samples,  the  test  tubes  containing  selenite  broth  were  incubated  for  6 
hours at 37  C  immediately after coming to the  laboratory  for  the  enrichment 
of the Salmonella spp. 
   Isolation  of  Salmonella  spp.  Serial  dilutions  up  to  10–3  were  made  for    soil 
sample. 0.1 ml of sample from intestinal fluid, 0.2 ml of sample prepared from 
soil  of chicken  market (dilution  up to 10–3) and a  loopfull of selective selenite 
broth from previously incubated cloacal swab sample were spread on the solid 
surface of Salmonella-Shigella (SS) agar medium (Hi-Media, India). A total of 
1.0 ml sample from intestinal fluid and soil of chicken market was placed onto 
sterile plates which was then  mixed with sterile medium poured into the plates 
after  being  cooled  to  about  42-45  C.  About  10-100  ml  of  water  sample  from 
egg  surface  and  hand  wash  of  chicken  handlers  was  filtrated  through  the 
membrane  filter  (0.45  µm,  Millipore)  to  isolate  the  organism.  The  membrane 
filter was then placed on the surface of Salmonella-Shigella (SS) agar medium. 
Replications  of  all  samples  using  triplicate  plates  were  tested  for  successful 
isolation of typical colonies by incubating them at 37 C for 24 hours. 
   Biochemical  Identification  and  Serotyping  of  Salmonella    spp.  A  total  of 
150  strains  were  subjected  for  biochemical  identification  including  Gram 
staining,  urease  test,  catalase  test,  oxidase  test,  H2S  production  test,  lactose 
utilization  test,  indole  test,  Voges-Proskauer  test  and  citrate  utilization  test 
according  to  Buchanan  and  Gibbons,  1974  (25).  Moreover,  Salmonella 
serotyping was determined by latex agglutination tests using polyvalent antisera 
(Denka  Seiken  Co.  Ltd,  Tokyo,  Japan),  according  to  the  manufacturer’s 
instruction. The presumptive Salmonella isolates were mixed with the latex test 
reagent  and  was  observed  for  the  agglutination  reaction  to  check  the  presence 
of Salmonella. 
   Antimicrobial  Susceptibility  Test.  A  total  of  100  selected  Salmonella 
strains,  recovered  from  cloacal  swab,  intestinal  fluid,  handwash  of  chicken 
handler,  egg  surface  and  soil  sample  from  chicken  market,  were  tested  for 
resistance  against  antimicrobial  agents  by  Kirby-Bauer  method  (26)  using 
Mueller-Hinton  agar  plates.  The  standard  procedure  of  the  Clinical  and 
Laboratory  Standards  Institute  (CLSI)  (27)  were  strictly  followed  throughout 
the testing procedure. Quality control strain Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was 
included  in  each  run.  All  Salmonella  isolates  were  subjected  against  14 
commercial  antibiotic  discs  (Becton  Dickinson  Antibiotic  Disc,  U.S.A.)  of 
streptomycin  (10  µg),  erythromycin  (15  µg),  chloramphenicol  (30  µg), 
ciprofloxacin  (10  µg),  tetracycline  (30  µg),  penicillin  (10  µg),  norfloxacin  (10 
µg), cephalexin (15 µg), riphampicin (5 µg), cefixine (5 µg), ampicillin (10 µg), 
nalidixic acid (30 µg) and gentamicin (10 µg). The isolates were categorized as 
susceptible, 
intermediate  and  resistant  according  to  the  zone  diameter 
interpretative standards recommendations by CLSI (27).

DISCUSSION 

 

   The  present  study  demonstrated  a  considerable  high 
frequency (26.6%) of contamination in poultry samples 
with  Salmonella  spp.  Therefore,  poultry  seems  to  be 
one  of  the  main  reservoirs  of  Salmonella  spp.  in 
Bangladesh.  The  high  level  of  contamination  indicates 
an  alarming  situation,  both  for  chicken  farming  and 
public  health  as  well.  A  similar  rate  (25%)  of 
Salmonella  spp.  contamination  in  the  samples  from 
poultry  and  poultry  environments  has  been  evident  by 
Hassan,  2004  in  Bangladesh  (28).  That  study  also 
reported that 25% of the cloacal swab samples and50% 
of  intestinal  fluid  samples  were  contaminated  with 
Salmonella  spp.  In  this  study,  we  found  Salmonella 
contamination  in  26%  and  60%  of  cloacal  swab  and 
intestinal fluid samples, respectively. The occurance of 
Salmonella  contamination  in  samples  from  poultry 
sources has also been reported from various parts of the 
world; 17%, 35%, 36%, 39%, and 53% in USA, Spain, 
Korea, Brazil and Vietnam, consequtively (29-33). The 
presence  of  Salmonella  spp.  in  the  hand  wash  samples 
aa     
 

17 

 

 
of  chicken  handler  indicated  a  potential  breakdown  of  
 
personal  hygiene  at  the  stage  of  chicken  handling  and 
processing. 
 
   Studies have demonstrated that poultry feeds have been 
implicated as an important source of Salmonella spp. (34) 
and  may  therefore  be  the  consequence  of  the  subsequent 
 
contamination of eggs. However, egg surface  might  have 
been contaminated with Salmonella spp. with feces during 
 
lay  in  unhygienic  condition  or  from  infected  poultry. 
Among the animal protein ingredients, a major ingredient 
 
of poultry feeds, locally processed cheap fish wastes were 
found  to  be  a  vital  cause  for  bacterial  contamination  of 
 
poultry feeds (18). Moreover, Salmonella was reported as 
a  common  microflora  in  animal  feedstuffs,  raw  feeding 
materials and poultry feeds (34). Careless and unhygienic 
 
frequent  source  of 
handling  process  serves  as  a 
contamination  with Salmonella  in pre-stuffed chickens  in 
 
poultry shops. Poultry and poultry products like eggs and 
plastic-wrapped poultry meat found in various super shops 
 
and  ready-to-eat  foods  become  cross  contaminated  with 
Salmonella  spp.and  other  pathogenic  bacteria  from  food 
 
handlers  with  poor  personal  hygiene  and  may  be  from 
other raw poultry products. 
 
   In  addition,  our  study  confirmed  a  high  incidence  of 
antibiotic  resistance  with  the  frequency  of  20%  to  100% 
among  Salmonella  spp. isolated from poultry and poultry 
 
environments in Bangladesh. In present study, Salmonella 
strains  isolated  from  poultry  sources  were  commonly 
 
and 
resistant 
chloramphenicol  and  susceptible  to  nalidixic  acid  and 
 
gentamicin as found in several studies in Bangladesh (28, 
32,  33,  35-37).  However,  resistance  against  gentamicin 
 
in  all  strains  and 
and  streptomycin  was  absent 
comparatively  lower  resistance  was  observed  against

norfloxacin, 
Resistance against penicilin, ampicilin, tetracycline and 
erythromycin was often observed due to low cost, ready 
availability and for drug abuse (33). Therefore, prudent 
use  of  antimicrobials  in  animal  production  system  has 
been  accepted  worldwide  as  a  means  of  preventing 
development  of 
in 
pathogenic  bacteria  (38).  Moreover,  all  the  isolates 
exhibited  multidrug  resistance  against  more  than  five 
antibiotics.  Similar  findings  on  multidrug  resistance 
among  Salmonella  strains  have  been  reported  from 
Bangladesh and various parts of the world (18, 28, 35-
37).  
   The ability of bacteria to acquire antibiotic resistance 
gene  and  subsequently  spread  them  to  many  different 
bacterial species is now well known. Integrons play an 
important  part  in  the  transfer  of  resistance  among 
Salmonella serotypes to a variety of antimicrobial drugs 
(37,  39).  Several  surveys  on  antibiotic  operation  in 
Bangladesh  have  revealed  that  peoples  are  in  the  habit 
of  consuming  antibiotics  familiarized 
in  frequent 
uptake of antibiotics than necessary (28) and antibiotics 
can be bought here easily  from drugstores  without any 
prescription. It may facilitate the development of multi-
regular  exploit  of 
drug 
antimicrobials  would  put  selective  pressure 
for 
development  and  proliferation  of  resistance  genes.  In 
addition,  low  cost  and  available  antimicrobials  like 
ampicillin, penicillin, tetracycline and erythromycin are 
frequently  used  as  growth  promoters  or  feed  additives 
or  preservatives  to  the  food  producing  animals  and 
poultry 
food 
requirements 
in 
Bangladesh.  
   The results of the study have illustrated the extent of 
antibiotic  resistance  in  Salmonella  serotypes  from 
poultry  sources  in  Bangladesh.  The  domestic  and 
commercial handlers of poultry and poultry products in 
chicken  shops  and  household  and  the  peoples  engaged 
in  the  poultry  farms  need  more  attention  to  strictly 
follow the rules and guidelines of hygiene to reduce or 
eliminate the risk of antibiotic resistant Salmonella and 
other  pathogenic  microbes.  In  addition,  the  use  of 
antibiotics  both  for  farming  and  for  medication  should 
be  astute  to  minimize  the  chance  for  organisms  to 
develop resistance.
