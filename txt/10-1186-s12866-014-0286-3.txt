Abstract

Background: A main export market for chicken meat from industrialized countries is sub-Saharan Africa. We
hypothesized that antibiotic resistant bacteria could be exported to developing countries through chicken meat
trade. The objective was to investigate the occurrence and molecular types of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae
and Staphylococcus aureus in chicken meat in Gabon and to assess their dissemination among humans.
Results: Frozen chicken meat samples imported from industrialized countries to Gabon (n = 151) were screened
for ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and S. aureus. Genotypes and resistance genes (SHV, TEM, CTX-M, CMY-2)
of isolates from meat were compared with isolates derived from humans.
The contamination rate per chicken part (i. e. leg, wing) with ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL E. coli, no other
ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were found) and S. aureus was 23% and 3%, respectively. The beta-lactamase
CTX-M 1 was predominant in ESBL E. coli from meat samples but was not found in isolates from cases of human
colonization or infection. S. aureus belonging to spa type t002 (multilocus sequence type ST5) were found both
in chicken meat and humans.
Conclusion: There is a risk to import ESBL E. coli to Gabon but molecular differences between isolates from humans
and chicken meat argue against a further dissemination. No MRSA isolate was detected in imported chicken meat.

Background
The global trade volume is steadily increasing and the ex-
change of various goods may contribute to economic
wealth and development. However, global travel and trade
bear the risk of transmitting pathogens through travelers
or goods. While measles, syphilis, tuberculosis or smallpox
have spread in the age of exploration and colonization,
nowadays, new pathogens are emerging [1].

For instance, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O104:
H4, which caused an outbreak in central Europe in 2011,
was most likely imported through seeds from Egypt [2].
Similarly, international travel, transfer of patients and

medical tourists facilitate the import of various patho-
gens such as extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-
and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae or
Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) positive Staphylo-
coccus aureus [3-5].

The frequent use of antibiotics - not only as therapeutics
but also as growth promoters - has contributed to the
emergence of antibiotic resistance in animal husbandry [6].
Hence, in European countries, industrially raised poultry
and chicken can be contaminated with ESBL-producing
E. coli (ESBL E. coli, up to 58–93.3% of chicken) and
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA, 0.7-37.2% of chicken)
[7-12]. One study showed that contamination of food items
with multidrug-resistant bacteria might be an important ve-
hicle for the spread of antibiotic resistance [13].

While current literature mostly indicates an import of
antimicrobial resistant pathogens from developing countries

to the industrialized world, there is a potential trans-
mission pathway for such bacteria, which is diametric-
ally opposed: Many industrialized countries do not only
produce poultry meat for their domestic market but also
for export to low income or developing countries. The
leading exporters of poultry meat in 2007 were the USA,
Brazil and the Netherlands. Main import markets were
sub-Saharan Africa and Asia (http://kids.fao.org/glipha).

Our hypothesis was that the import of meat from indus-
trialized countries contributes to the emergence of multi-
drug resistance among humans in developing countries
such as Gabon, Central Africa [14]. We therefore analyzed
the contamination of chicken meat with ESBL-producing
Enterobacteriacae (ESBL Enterobacteriaceae) and S. aureus
in Gabon and compared genotypes of these pathogens with
isolates from human carriage and infection.

Results
Origin of samples
In total, 151 chicken meat samples (88 legs, 63 wings)
were analyzed. The chicken samples were frozen during
shipment and storage in the supermarkets. Chicken meat

was imported from the USA (n = 89), Spain (n = 60), Brazil
and Turkey (each n = 1, Figure 1). No meat from do-
mestic markets was sold in the five studied supermar-
kets in Lambaréné, Gabon.

ESBL Enterobacteriaceae
The prevalence of ESBL E. coli in chicken meat was 23%
(n = 14 of 60, Table 1). ESBL Enterobacteriaceae other
than E. coli were not detected on the colorimetric media.
We therefore included only ESBL E. coli isolates from
human carriage and infection for comparison. Partici-
pants provided an informed consent prior to sampling.
Isolates from humans came from already existing strain
collections (Table 2). Among imported chicken meat in
Gabon, ESBL E. coli was clearly associated with meat
samples from Spain as the producing country (OR = Inf.,
95% CI: 7.5–Inf., p < 0.001). The phylogenetic groups A
and B1 were predominant in ESBL E. coli from chicken
meat. In contrast, the other E. coli phylogenetic groups
were more equally distributed among isolates from
humans (Table 3). The beta-lactamases CTX-M 1 and
CTX-M 14 were predominant in ESBL E. coli
from

country are shown. Screening for ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae was only done for a subset of samples from the USA (n = 34) and Spain (n = 26).

chicken meat. However, these beta-lactamases were not
found in isolates from humans. In contrast, the predom-
inant beta-lactamase in isolates from human carriage
and infection was CTX-M 15 (Table 3). Other beta-
lactamases (TEM, SHV) were also found in ESBL E. coli
from chicken meat or human carriage and infection.
The plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase CMY-2
was not detected among ESBL E. coli isolates.

The antibiotic resistance rates were lower in ESBL E. coli
from chicken meat, compared to isolates from human car-
riage and infection (Table 3). The highest non-beta-lactam
resistance in chicken meat was against ciprofloxacin
(n = 8). No resistance was detected against meropenem,
imipenem or ertapenem.

Staphylococcus aureus
In total, 3% (n = 5) of all meat samples were contami-
nated with S. aureus in Gabon. No MRSA was detected
as confirmed by the absence of mecA.

S. aureus was more frequently found in poultry meat
from the USA (5%) compared to Spain (1%, Figure 1).
Isolates from chicken meat mainly belonged to multilo-
cus sequence type (MLST) clonal complex (CC) CC5
which was associated with sequence type ST5 and spa
types t002 (n = 3). Three so far unknown STs were de-
tected and assigned to ST2622 (chicken, t386), ST2666
(human carriage, t084), ST2702 (human infection, t272,
Table 4). Due to repeated amplification failure, we were un-
able to determine the ST for one isolates belonging to spa
type t591 (chicken, MLST profile: ?-1-1-1-1-1-1, CC5).

Isolates belonging to t002 (ST5) were found in chicken
meat and humans (Table 4). Of note, resistance rates for
penicillin were always lower in isolates from chicken
meat compared to isolates from human carriage and in-
fection (Table 5).

Discussion
We assessed the import and potential spread of ESBL E.
coli and S. aureus through chicken meat in Gabon, Central
Africa. Main findings were a high proportion of imported
chicken meat in our sample collection and a high preva-
lence of ESBL E. coli. Beta-lactamases associated with
chicken meat were not found in ESBL E. coli from carriage
and infection in humans. Chicken-related S. aureus geno-
types were found in human isolates from carriage and
infection.

The high proportion of imported chicken products in
Gabon is not surprising because the country has an ex-
cess of import of poultry meat. The import of poultry
products increased in Gabon from 11,149 Mt (1997) to
43,875 Mt (2007), the ratio of exports to imports in
2007 was 0.0 (Germany: 0.8, http://kids.fao.org/glipha).

No ESBL Enterobacteriaceae other than ESBL E. coli
were detected which is in line with recent reports
where the proportion of ESBL E. coli among all ESBL-
producers from chicken was 93.8% (Germany), 76.8%
(the Netherlands) and 58-67% (Spain) [8,11,15]. The
prevalence of ESBL E. coli in chicken meat was lower in
chicken products from the US compared to Spain
which could be explained by a generally lower ESBL E.
coli contamination rate in chicken from the US [11].
This lower contamination rate might be achieved by a
“pathogen reduction treatment” with chemical com-
pounds (e. g. chlorinated water) in the US which is pro-
hibited in the European Union [16].

The predominance of the phylogenetic groups A and
B1 in poultry products was expected as these groups are
mostly found in the environment in contrast to B2
which is associated with mammals [17].

The ESBL encoding genes found in chicken meat in
Gabon mainly belonged to CTX-M 1 and CTX-M 14
(Table 3). The predominance of CTX-M 14 over CTX-M
1 reflects the proportion of CTX-M subtypes in Spain [7].
Our data do not provide any evidence for a transmission

of ESBL E. coli from poultry to humans as CTX-M 1 and
CTX-M 14 from chicken meat were neither detected in
ESBL E. coli
from carriage nor infection in humans
(Table 3). This is in contrast to Europe and the Americas,
where CTX-M 1 was the most common beta-lactamase in
ESBL E. coli from humans [18].

It is unclear why the same ESBL subtype (CTX-M 1)
occur in poultry related and human isolates in Europe
but not in Gabon [18]. One might argue that the preva-
lence and concentration of ESBL E. coli in chicken meat
in Gabon is not yet high enough to be transmitted and
to establish a sustainable colonization in humans [19]. It
is also possible, that our samples size was too small to
detect CTX-M subtypes with lower prevalence such as
CTX-M 1 which accounts for 7% of all ESBL/AmpC
types in humans in Europe [18].

Chicken meat can be contaminated not only with
ESBL Enterobacteriaceae but also with S. aureus and
MRSA, in particular. S. aureus research in livestock ani-
mals has been focused on MRSA. The prevalence of
MRSA in poultry products is up to 37.2% in Germany
[10,20], but varies significantly within and between the
different countries in Europe (0% in Switzerland, 6.9%
in the Netherlands) [10,12]. This variation in MRSA

colonization might be the reason why we did not detect
any MRSA among the S. aureus isolates in our study.
Nevertheless, genotyping of methicillin susceptible S.
aureus (MSSA) revealed that some S. aureus from
poultry meat and humans in Gabon share the same spa
type (t002, ST5). On the one hand, it was postulated
that a human-to-poultry transmission of S. aureus ST5
isolates occurred in the 1980s and that
this clonal
lineage now spreads in chicken around the world (ex-
cept for Australia, where stringent controls of imported
poultry products are applied) [21]. On the other hand,

there might be a risk of transmission of isolates belong-
ing to t002 back to humans [22].

Although our study provides important information
about the spread of pathogens through the trade with
chicken products, some limitations need to be ad-
dressed. First, the prevalence of S. aureus in chicken
meat in Gabon might have been underestimated as we
did not use S. aureus selective enrichment broths and
chromogenic agars. This practice was chosen because
our objective was to use preferentially methods which
can be easily applied in rather basally equipped labora-
tories. Second, few months after the start of the study
we realized the high burden of ESBL-producing Entero-
bacteriaceae in humans Gabon [14]. From that point, we
decided to use chromogenic media for the screening of
ESBL E. coli in chicken meat. Therefore only a propor-
tion of samples were consecutively screened for ESBL-
producing Enterobacteriaceae (60 of 151, Table 1).
Third, more comprehensive genotyping approaches (e.g.
sequencing of plasmids) would have been preferred to de-
tect more reliably potential sources of
transmission.
Fourth, our results might not be representative for the
whole country due to the small sample size. Fifth, due to
the cross sectional study design we cannot draw any con-
clusions regarding the direction of transmission between
chicken meat and humans, in case there is any. Sixth, the
chromogenic agar that we used might suppress the growth
of Enterobacteriaceae carrying the AmpC resistance type.
Therefore, the prevalence of CMY-2 refers to ESBL-
producers only.

Conclusions
In conclusion, there is a risk to import ESBL E. coli to
Gabon but molecular differences between isolates from
humans and chicken meat argue against a further dis-
semination. No MRSA isolate was imported through
poultry meat.

Methods
Ethical clearance
No ethical approval was sought to analyze chicken meat
samples. In Gabon, no ethical approval is requested if
already existing isolates from clinical samples are analysed
[23]. Ethical clearance was obtained from our institutional
review board (IRB) in Lambaréné to collect swabs from
asymptomatic healthy carriers (Comité d’Éthique Régional
Indépendant de Lambaréné, CERIL). The ESBL Entero-
bacteriaceae from carriers derived from children and the
legal representative of each child gave documented oral
informed consent prior to enrolment [14]. The IRB ap-
proved the use of documented oral informed consent
to collect rectal swabs from children (CERIL 09/2010).
Written informed consent was given to screen for nasal
colonization with S. aureus. The use of written informed

consent to obtain nasal swabs was approved by our IRB
(CERIL 15/2009).

Sample collection
In a cross
from frozen
chicken meat (wing, leg) sold at five commercial mar-
kets in Lambaréné, Gabon were randomly collected
from December 2011 to November 2012. All samples
were originally designated for human consumption and
were stored in freezers until sampling. The country of ori-
gin and the species (i.e. chicken) were recorded according
to declarations on the packaging. To guarantee sterile
sampling conditions, approximately 5 g of meat were sam-
pled using gloves, sterile forceps and scalpels. Only one
sample per selling unit/batch was taken. Samples were
stored at −20°C until microbiological culture.

Our initial objective was to investigate the occurrence
of S. aureus in chicken meat, but since a recent study
showed a high carriage rate of ESBL Enterobacteriaceae
in Gabonese children, we also included the screening for
ESBL Enterobacteriaceae after beginning of the study
(Table 1) [14].

The poultry-related isolates were compared with ESBL
Enterobacteriaceae (matched for species found in chicken
meat samples) and S. aureus from humans (carriage and
infection) from already existing strain collections (Table 2).
Human isolates from infection derived from routine
diagnostics of the Albert Schweitzer Hospital, Lambaréné,
Gabon and were consecutively collected.

Detection of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae
The meat samples were directly streaked on colorimetric
ESBL-selective agar plates (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile,
France). After overnight culture in non-selective brain-
heart-infusion enrichment broth, the samples were again
plated on ESBL-selective agar plates. Colorimetric col-
onies on ESBL-plates were subjected to species identifi-
cation and susceptibility testing using Vitek 2 automated
systems (bioMérieux).

Antimicrobial resistance was evaluated using EUCAST
breakpoints for susceptibility testing (Version 3.1, 2011);
susceptibility of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae to
beta-lactams was reported as found. We confirmed the
ESBL phenotype by double-disc diffusion tests according
to the manufacturer’s instruction (Mast discs, Mast diag-
nostics, Bootle, UK). A PCR was used to detect the genes
encoding the beta-lactamases blaSHV, blaTEM, blaCTX-M
and blaCMY-2; the blaCTX-M genes were sequenced for sub-
typing [24,25].

Detection of Staphylococcus aureus
The meat samples were directly streaked on Columbia
blood agar plates supplemented with aztreonam disks
(13 μg; Oxoid, Hants, UK). After overnight culture in

the detection of blaZ and mecA, respectively [26,27].

Genotyping
Each ESBL E. coli isolate was assigned to its phylogenetic
group (A, B1, B2, D) according to the genetic pattern of
chuA, yjaA and the anonymous DNA Fragment TSPE4.C2
[28]. S. aureus was spa typed and multilocus sequence typ-
ing (MLST) was done exemplarily for one isolate of each
spa type for each group (chicken, carriage and infection in
humans) [29-31]. MLST clonal complexes (CC) were de-
termined with eBURST using the whole MLST dataset and
the stringent group definition of six of seven shared alleles
(http://saureus.mlst.net/eburst).

Statistics
Associations between categorical variables were tested
using Fisher’s exact test. The odds ratio (OR) and 95%
confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated to assess the
strength of association. The significance level was set at
5%. Statistical analyses were performed using “R” (http://
cran.r-project.org) and the package “Epicalc”. The map was
created with “R” and the package “Maps”.

Abbreviations
CC: Clonal complex; ESBL: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase; MLST: Multilocus
sequence typing; MRSA: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus;
ST: Sequence type.
