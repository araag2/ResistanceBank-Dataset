The current study aimed to analyze the prevalence and characterization of Salmonella
enterica isolated from animals in slaughterhouses before slaughter. A total of 143
non-duplicate Salmonella were recovered from 1,000 fresh fecal swabs collected from
four major pig slaughterhouses (49/600, 8.2%) and four major chicken slaughterhouses
(94/400, 23.5%) between March and July 2016. Among Salmonella isolates from pigs,
the predominant serovars were Salmonella Rissen (28/49, 57.1%) and Typhimurium
(14/49, 28.6%), and high antimicrobial resistance rates were observed for tetracycline
(44/49, 89.8%) and ampicillin (16/49, 32.7%). Class 1 integrons were detected in
10.2% (5/49) of these isolates and all contained gene cassettes aadA2 (0.65 kb). Two
β-lactamase genes were detected among these isolates, and most of these isolates
carried blaTEM-1 (46/49), followed by blaOXA-1(4/49). Seven STs (MLST/ST, multilocus
sequence typing) were detected in these isolates, and the predominant type was ST469
(19.6%). Among Salmonella isolates from chickens, the predominant serovars were
Salmonella Indiana (67/94, 71.3%) and Enteritidis (23/94, 24.5%), and high antimicrobial
resistance rates were observed for nalidixic acid (89/94, 94.7%), ampicillin (88/94,
93.6%) and tetracycline (81/94, 86.2%). Class 1 integrons were detected in 23 isolates
(23/94, 24.5%), which contained empty integrons (0.15 kb, n = 6) or gene cassettes
drfA17-aadA5 (1.7 kb, n = 6), aadA2 (1.2 kb, n = 5), drfA16-blaPSE-1-aadA2-ereA2 (1.6
kb, n = 5) or drfA1-aadA1 (1.4 kb, n = 1). Three β-lactamase genes were detected, and
all 94 isolates carried blaTEM-1, followed by blaCTX-M-55 (n = 19) and blaSPE−1 (n = 3).
Five STs were found in these isolates, and the predominant type was ST17 (71.3%). Our
ﬁndings indicated that Salmonella was widespread in animals at slaughter and may be
transmitted from animal to fork.

INTRODUCTION

Salmonella enterica is a major global foodborne pathogen (Chiu et al., 2010; Scallan et al., 2011).
More than 2,600 diﬀerent serovars have been identiﬁed worldwide (Guibourdenche et al., 2010). In
China, Salmonella causes an estimated 22.2% of foodborne diseases, and the majority of diseases
are associated with the ingestion of contaminated meat products (Wang et al., 2007). Both pigs and

Salmonella from Animals in Slaughterhouses

chickens have been recognized as an important reservoir for
antibiotic resistant Salmonella, and the resistance genes can be
transferred to other bacteria via mobile genetic elements, such as
plasmids and gene cassettes (Vo et al., 2006).

Agents of diﬀerent antimicrobial classes, such as β-lactams
or ﬂuoroquinolones, are frequently used in clinical practice for
Salmonella enterica infections. Unfortunately, Salmonella has
gradually developed a high resistance rate to these antimicrobials,
leading to the increase of healthcare costs and even clinical
treatment
failure (Cui et al., 2009; Gonzalez-Sanz et al.,
2009). To date, numerous studies have been conducted to
monitor antimicrobial resistance and molecular epidemiology of
Salmonella isolated from pigs and chickens in slaughterhouses
(Van et al., 2013; Mohamed et al., 2014).

However,

little information concerning prevalence and
characterization of Salmonella from animals in slaughterhouses
in China is available. Shandong province, as a major breeding
region,
is the main producer of meat products in China.
Therefore, major animal slaughterhouses in Shandong province,
China were singled out as sampling sites to analyze the
prevalence and characterization of Salmonella from animals in
slaughterhouses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Description of Sampling Sites
From March to July 2016, 1,000 fresh fecal swabs were collected
from four major pig slaughterhouses with process capacity of
1,500–2,500 pigs per day (150 samples per pig slaughterhouse)
and four major chicken slaughterhouses with process capacity
of 10,000–40,000 chickens per day (100 samples per chicken
slaughterhouse). The animal slaughterhouses are respectively
located in Weihai, Ciyao, Zhucheng, and Yantai regions in
Shandong province, China. Sampling was carried out before
slaughter, and at the time animals from diﬀerent farms has been
mixed.

Identiﬁcation and Sreotyping of Salmonella
fresh fecal swabs were
From each animal slaughterhouse,
randomly collected from diﬀerent
individual animals, and
transported in an ice box to our laboratory within 6 h for
further bacteriological analysis. Each swab sample was added
into 50 mL buﬀered peptone water (BPW) and was incubated
at 37◦C for 16 to 18 h. After that, 0.1 mL of
the BPW
suspensions was sub-cultured in 10 mL subpackaged Rappaport-
Vassiliadis (RV) broth at 42◦C for 24 h. One loopful of
each RV broth culture was then plated onto xylose lysine
tergitol 4 agar plates, and was incubated at 37◦C for 24
to 48 h (Yan et al., 2010). Presumptive Salmonella colonies
were identiﬁed using both the VITEK system (BioMerieux,
Marcy 1’Etoile, France) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
ampliﬁcation of
the inherent gene invA (Malorny et al.,
2003).

All Salmonella isolates were serotyped according to the
Kauﬀmann-White scheme by slide agglutination with O and
H antigen-speciﬁc sera (Tianrun Bio-Pharmaceutical, Ningbo,
China) (Grimont and Weill, 2007).

Detection of Class I Integrons and
β-Lactamase-Encoding Genes
Bacterial DNA was extracted using a TIANamp bacteria DNA
kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The gene cassettes within the variable region of
class I integrons were detected via polymerase chain reaction
(PCR), using previously described primers and procedures
(Kerrn et al., 2002). The PCR products were cloned into the
pMD18-T vector using the pMD18-T cloning kit (Takara, Dalian,
China) and submitted for sequencing (Invitrogen, Beijing,
China).

PCR screening for β-lactamase-encoding genes blaTEM,
blaPSE-1, blaCMY-2, blaSHV, blaDHA-1, blaOXA, and blaCTX-M was
performed as previously described (Guerra et al., 2001; Chen
et al., 2004; Batchelor et al., 2005; Hasman et al., 2005; Li
et al., 2013). The PCR products were puriﬁed and subsequently
sequenced.

MLST
The MLST analysis was performed by sequencing the fragments
of seven housekeeping genes (aroC, dnaN, hemD, hisD, purE,
sucA, and thrA), and the alleles and STs were assigned
according to the MLST scheme at http://mlst.warwick.ac.uk/
mlst/dbs/Senterica. A minimum spanning tree was created using
Bionumerics software 6.5 (Applied Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium),
according to the instructions (the unweighted pair group method
of arithmetic averages method).

Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using package SPSS 15.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The chi-square test was used to
compare the prevalence, multidrug resistance rate and carriage
of class 1 integron of Salmonella isolated from pigs and chickens,
and P < 0.05 was considered diﬀerence signiﬁcant.

RESULTS

Prevalence and Serotypes of Salmonella
From pig slaughterhouses, 49 Salmonella isolates were recovered
(49/600, 8.2%), including 13 from Weihai (13/150, 8.7%), 9
from Ciyao (9/150, 6.0%), 11 from Yantai (11/150, 10.7%),

and 16 from Zhucheng (16/150, 10.7%) (Table 1). In terms
of isolation rate of Salmonella, no signiﬁcant diﬀerence was
found between the pig slaughterhouses (P > 0.05). The 49
Salmonella belonged to 6 serovars,
including Salmonella
Rissen (n = 28), Typhimurium (n = 14), Grampian
(n = 3), Derby (n = 2), Indiana (n = 1), and Enteritidis
(n = 1). The most common serovars were Salmonella
Rissen (28/49, 57.1%) and Typhimurium (14/49, 28.6%)
(Table 2).

From chicken slaughterhouses, 94 Salmonella isolates were
recovered (94/400, 23.5%), including 23 from Weihai (23/100,
23.0%), 33 from Ciyao (33/100, 33.0%), 17 from Yantai (17/100,
17.0%), and 21 from Zhucheng (21/150, 21.0%) (Table 1). In
terms of isolation rate of Salmonella, no signiﬁcant diﬀerence
was found between the chicken slaughterhouses (P > 0.05).
These 94 Salmonella isolates belonged to 4 serovars, including
Salmonella Indiana (n = 67), Enteritidis (n = 23), Typhimurium
(n = 3), and Hadar (n = 1). The dominant serovars were
Salmonella Indiana (67/94, 71.3%) and Enteritidis (23/94, 24.5%)
(Table 2).

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing
All 49 isolates from pig slaughterhouses were susceptible to
amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and cefotaxime. But most isolates
were resistance to tetracycline (44/49, 89.8%) and ampicillin
(16/49, 32.7%). In addition, 7 isolates (7/49, 14.3%) exhibited
MDR (Table 2). In addition, 4 isolates were susceptible to all
antibiotics used in this study.

exhibited MDR (Table 2). Of note, MDR rate of Salmonella from
chickens was higher than that from pigs (P < 0.05). In addition,
2 isolates were susceptible to all antibiotics used in this study.

Characteristics of Class 1 Integrons and
β-Lactamase-Encoding Genes
Among the 49 isolates recovered from pigs, class 1 integrons
were found in 5 isolates (5/49, 10.2%), including 4 Salmonella
Typhimurium and 1 Enteritidis. The 5 isolates only contained the
single resistance gene cassette aadA2 (0.65 kb). Two β-lactamase
genes were detected among the isolates, most of the isolates
carried blaSPE-1 (n = 46) and blaOXA-1(n = 4) (Table 2).

Among the 94 isolates recovered from chicken, class 1
integrons were found in 23 isolates (23/94, 24.5%), including
16 Salmonella Indiana, 5 Enteritidis and 2 Typhimurium. Of
these isolates, 5 groups of resistance gene cassettes were detected:
empty integrons (0.15 kb, n = 6), drfA17-aadA5 (1.6 kb, n = 6),
aadA2 (1.2 kb, n = 5), drfA16-blaPSE-1-aadA2-ereA2 (1.7 kb, n =
5), and drfA1-aadA1 (1.4 kb, n = 1). Three β-lactamase genes
were detected among these isolates. Most of the isolates carried
blaTEM-1 (n = 94), followed by blaCTX-M -55 (n = 19) and
blaSPE-1(n = 3) (Table 2).

MLST
One hundred and forty-three Salmonella isolates were divided
into 9 STs, including 7 STs from pigs (ST11, ST17, ST19, ST34,
ST40, ST358, and ST469), and 5 STs from chickens (ST11, ST17,
ST19, ST33, and ST3172). The STs identiﬁed in the present study
showed the following correlations with Salmonella serovars: ST11
with Salmonella Enteritidis, ST17 with Indiana, and ST469 with
Rissen.

BioNumerics software version 6.5 was used to generate
a minimum-spanning tree based on all the sources of STs
(Figure 1). The dominant ST was ST17 (68/143, 47.6%), with
most of isolates from chickens and only one from pigs, followed
by ST469 (28/143, 19.6%), with all isolates from pigs. ST34
and ST19 belonged to one clone complex and had the same
serovars of Salmonella Typhimurium. ST11 and ST3172 belonged
to one clone complex, and had the same serovars of Salmonella
Enteritidis.

In this study, Salmonella isolation rate from pigs (8.2%)
was much lower than that
in Jiangsu province,
China (Cai et al., 2016), and the most common serotype
in pigs was Salmonella Rissen, which in consistent with the

Salmonella from Animals in Slaughterhouses

Salmonella Indiana and Enteritidis, consistent with ﬁndings
reported in Henan, China (Bai et al., 2015). However, this
ﬁnding diﬀered from the result reported in Sichuan province,
China,
in which Salmonella Derby and Typhimurium were
the most common serotypes (Li et al., 2013). Additionally,
Salmonella Kentucky and Enteritidis were the most common
serotypes
in the USA (National Antimicrobial Resistance
Monitoring System, 2011), and Salmonella Typhimurium
in the EU (European Food Safety Authority, 2014). This
diﬀerence may be associated with geographical regions. In
the present study, Salmonella Indiana showed a high MDR
rate (61/68, 89.7%), similar with the result conducted in
China (Lu et al., 2011), which demonstrated that most
of Salmonella Indiana showed MDR, and these bacteria
were not only resistant to streptomycin and tetracycline but
also were resistant to chloramphenicol, ﬂuoroquinolones and
cephalosporin antibiotics.

In the current study, most Salmonella isolates showed high
resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin, and nalidixic acid, similar
to the report on slaughterhouses in Italy (Piras et al., 2011),
suggesting that these drugs may have been widely used on
animals during disease control and prevention. A high resistance
rate (63.4%) of nalidixic acid was observed in Salmonella isolates,
consistent with other reports (Piras et al., 2011; Siriken et al.,
2015). The resistance rate to ciproﬂoxacin was up to 42.7%.
The results may be related with the fact that ﬂuoroquinolone
antibiotics are the most common treatment for Salmonella
infections. A relatively high resistance rate to cefotaxime (29.1%)
was observed in this study, which may be associated with
the fact that third-generation cephalosporins have become the
primary drugs for the treatment of salmonellosis because of
the increase in ﬂuoroquinolone resistance. In addition, the
results of the present study showed the high prevalence of
multidrug resistant Salmonella isolates in chickens (91.5%),
much higher than those reported in Henan province (46.0%),
China (Bai et al., 2015) and in central China (34.7%) (Kuang
et al., 2015). In this study, MDR isolate rate of Salmonella
(91.5%) from chickens were higher than that (14.3%) from pigs,
and the higher occurrence of MDR Salmonella isolates from
chickens likely reﬂects the extensive use of antibiotics during
intensive rearing. In addition, MDR Salmonella is serotype-
dependent (Clemente et al., 2014): the data provided evidence
that Salmonella Indiana, Typhimurium and Enteritidis were
strongly associated with MDR phenotypes. However,
these
ﬁndings were diﬀerent from a previous study showing that
Salmonella Derby is commonly associated with MDR (Newell
et al., 2010).

In the present study, PCR identiﬁed class 1 integrons
in 19.6% of Salmonella isolates, which was similar to the
15.0% reported from retail meat products in the USA (Zhao
et al., 2009) but higher than that of (2.8%) reported from
milk products (Van et al., 2013). In the present study, the
incidence of class 1 integrons was higher in Salmonella
from chickens (24.5%) than Salmonella from pigs (10.2%)
(P < 0.05). Class 1 integrons are often associated with MDR
Salmonella isolates, consistent with the result of the present
study. In addition, the Salmonella isolates carrying class 1

pigs and chickens in slaughterhouses. Each circle represents one ST, and the
area of the circle corresponds to the number of isolates, the gray region
indicates that ST19 and ST34 belong to a clonal complex, ST11, and ST3172
belong to a clonal complex.

integrons included Salmonella Typhimurium, Enteritidis, and
Indiana.

Four β-lactamase genes were detected among Salmonella
isolates recovered from pigs and chickens: blaTEM-1, blaPSE-1,
blaOXA-1, and blaCTX-M-55. Most
isolates carried blaTEM-1,
consistent with the report from meat and milk products in
Egypt (Ashraf et al., 2014), but diﬀerent from the report from
animal slaughterhouses and retail meat products in Sichuan,
China, which showed the dominant β-lactamase gene was
blaOXA-1, followed by blaTEM-1, blaPSE-1, and blaCMY-2 (Li
et al., 2013). The fact that 46 Salmonella from pigs carried
blaTEM-1 whereas only 16 were resistant to ampicillin, and
only 88 out of 94 Salmonella carrying blaTEM-1 from chickens
showed resistant to ampicillin may be associated with the
expression status of blaTEM-1 genes and is needed to be further
studied.

In addition, blaCMY-2 encodes resistance to third-generation
cephalosporins, an important class of antibiotics used to treat
complicated cases of salmonellosis (Gonzalez-Sanz et al., 2009).
The incidence of blaCMY-2-positive Salmonella in China was low
and was only reported in Shanxi and Sichuan (Yang et al., 2010;
Li et al., 2013).

The MLST results revealed 9 STs identiﬁed in Salmonella
from pigs and chickens. ST19 and ST34 have continually
been reported to cause human salmonellosis in recent years,
and these bacteria belong to the same serotype, Salmonella
Typhimurium (Cai et al., 2016), and this circumstance was
also true for Salmonella Enteritidis, represented by ST11 and
ST3172. These ﬁndings suggested that serovars and STs were
tightly coupled (Sukhnanand et al., 2005). ST358 is rare
in China and corresponds to Salmonella Grampian, which
causes an unusual
increase in human cases of Salmonella
Grampian infections (Horvath et al., 2013). This observation
indicates
to

that Salmonella could spread from animals
