Nasal swabs of 163 healthy sheep were obtained from two farms and one abattoir in
Tunisia during 2010. Samples were inoculated in Baird Parker agar and ORSAB medium for
Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) recovery, respectively.
MRSA was detected in 5 of these 163 samples (3%) in ORSAB medium, and one isolate per
sample was further studied. MRSA isolates were mecA-positive, typed as ST153-CC80-
t044-agrIII, and contained blaZ, ant(6)-Ia, aph(30)-IIIa, erm(C), tet(K), and fusB genes
encoding penicillin, streptomycin, kanamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline and fusidic acid
resistance, respectively. These MRSA isolates showed indistinguishable or closely related
PFGE-patterns and harboured the lukF/lukS gene encoding the Panton-Valentine leukocidin
and the luk-ED, hla, hld, and hlgv genes. Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) were
recovered in 68 of the 163 samples (41.7%) and one isolate per sample was characterized.
Most of MSSA (82.4%) showed susceptibility to the tested antibiotics with exceptions:
penicillin (6%, carrying blaZ gene), tetracycline (19%, carrying tet(K) gene) and fusidic acid
(9%). The following toxin-genes were identiﬁed among MSSA: tst (53 isolates), luk-M (52),
luk-ED, hla, hlb, hld and hlgv (67), hlg (1), sec (49), sel (52), and the egc-cluster-like sen-sem-
sei-seo-seg (1). Ten spa-types (two of them new ones) and nine sequence types (six new
ones) were detected among the 73 S. aureus isolates, and they were ascribed to agr types I
and III. All MRSA and MSSA isolates were able to coagulate bovine plasma and MRSA
harboured the immune-evasion-gene-cluster type E. Conclusions. Nares of healthy sheep
could be a reservoir of PVL-positive community-associated-MRSA and also of TSST-positive
S. aureus isolates, with potential implications in public health.

1. Introduction

Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen that can
colonize the nares of different animals, including farm
animals (Weese and Duijkeren, 2009). This microorganism

is able to produce a wide range of extracellular toxins and
virulence factors. Strains producing the Panton-Valentine
leukocidin (PVL), the toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST),
and staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE) pose a risk for
humans and animals being associated with skin and soft
tissue infections and even with cases of severe pneumonia
(Jarraud et al., 2002; Francis et al., 2005). It is also relevant
to consider that the transmission of S. aureus is possible
either by direct contact with animals or through con-
taminated food as milk or cheese (Vautor et al., 2005).

Of particular concern is methicillin-resistant S. aureus
(MRSA) which is resistant to most of beta-lactams. MRSA

368

strains usually harbour multiple antimicrobial resistance
genes what constitutes an important clinical problem due to
the limited therapeutic options left (Fluit et al., 2001). The
ﬁrst cases of MRSA in animals were reported in 1972 from
bovine mammary infections. Thereafter, more MRSA strains
were detected in cattle and the number of reported cases is
recently increasing. Moreover, MRSA has been described in
other animal species such as horses, dogs and pigs, among
others (Weese and Duijkeren, 2009; Madec and Haenni,
2010) but data about MRSA in sheep remain scarce. In the
last years, a livestock-associated genetic lineage of MRSA
(LA-MRSA) of the sequence type ST398 has emerged in farm
animals, especially in pigs, and human infections owing to
this clonal lineage have also been reported (Kock et al., 2009;
Lozano et al., 2011). Recent cases of infections related to
strains of porcine origin (clone ST398) have highlighted the
possibility of transference of MRSA from animals to humans
(Madec and Haenni, 2010; Lozano et al., 2011). In addition,
data on MRSA (and mainly non-ST398 MRSA) in other
animal species than pigs are still scarce.

So far, few data do exist about the genetic lineages of S.
aureus or the prevalence of MRSA that colonize nares of
healthy sheep (Vautor et al., 2005; Alzohairy, 2011).
Additionally, as far as we know, no previous studies of this
type have been performed in animals in Tunisia and very few
in other African countries (Elbir et al., 2010). There are only
data about the prevalence and lineages of S. aureus in
healthy humans with different level of contact with farms or
domestic animals in that country (Ben Slama et al., 2011).
Sheep is an important agriculture animal species in Tunisia
as well as in other Northern African countries. Therefore, the
present study was undertaken to determine the carriage
rate, resistance mechanisms, virulence traits, and genetic
lineages of nasal S. aureus of healthy sheep in Tunisia.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sampling and microbiological isolation

Nasal swabs of 163 healthy sheep were obtained in two
farms (59 animals) and in one big abattoir (104 animals)
that receive sheep from farms of all Tunisia. Samples were
obtained during March–May 2010.

Swabs were incubated in Tryptone Soy Broth (TSB) for
48 h and then, they were subcultured on Baird Parker agar
(BD) and ORSAB medium (Oxacillin Resistance Screening
Agar Base, Oxoid) for 24–48 h, for S. aureus and MRSA
recovery, respectively. S. aureus suggestive colonies were
initially identiﬁed by conventional methods [Gram-stain-
ing, catalase test, oxidase test, DNase production, and
ability to coagulate rabbit plasma (BioRad)]. S. aureus
identiﬁcation was then conﬁrmed by ampliﬁcation of the
species-speciﬁc nuc gene (Go´ mez-Sanz et al., 2010).

All isolates were tested for their capacity to coagulate
bovine plasma (Sigma–Aldrich) following standard meth-
odology (Guinane et al., 2010).

2.2. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Susceptibility to 18 antimicrobial agents was per-
formed using the disk-diffusion method in accordance

with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
recommendations (CLSI, 2010). Antimicrobial agents
tested were (charge in mg/disk): penicillin (10), oxacillin
(1), cefoxitin (30), kanamycin (30), gentamicin (10),
tobramycin (10), tetracycline (30), chloramphenicol (30),
trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (1.25/23.75), erythromy-
cin (15), clindamycin (2), amikacin (30), ciproﬂoxacin (5),
mupirocin (5), vancomycin (30), teicoplanin (30), fusidic
acid (10) and streptomycin (10). Double-disk diffusion test
(D-test) with erythromycin and clindamycin disks was
implemented in all isolates to detect inducible clindamy-
cin resistance.

2.3. Detection of mecA gene and SCCmec-typing

The presence of the mecA gene was studied by PCR in all
oxacillin and/or cefoxitin resistant isolates (Zhang et al.,
2004). The SCCmec-typing was performed for mecA
positive isolates by a multiplex PCR strategy as previously
described (Kondo et al., 2007).

2.4. Detection of antimicrobial resistance genes

The ribosomal methylases encoded by erm(A), erm(B)
and erm(C) genes, which confer resistance to erythromy-
cin and clindamycin, and the efﬂux pump encoded by
msr(A) gene, conferring resistance to erythromycin, were
studied by PCR in erythromycin-resistant
isolates
(Go´ mez-Sanz et al., 2010). In addition, tet(K), tet(M) and
tet(L) genes conferring resistance to tetracycline, blaZ
gene to penicillin, fusB and fusC genes to fusidic acid, and
aph(30)-IIIa and ant(6)-Ia genes to kanamycin and
streptomycin, were studied by PCR in all antimicrobial-
resistant S. aureus isolates (Go´ mez-Sanz et al., 2010).
Mutations in elongation factor G were determined by
sequence analysis of fusA in all fusidic acid-resistant
isolates (O’Neill et al., 2002).

2.5. Pulsed-ﬁeld-gel-electrophoresis (PFGE)

All S. aureus isolates were characterized by PFGE with
SmaI restriction enzyme digestion as previously described
(Bouzaiane et al., 2008). Samples were run on 1% agarose
gel in 0.5% TBE buffer at 14 8C on a CHEF DR-II PFGE system
by using an initial switching time of 5 s which was
increased to 40 s during 20 h at 6 V/cm. The DNA
ﬁngerprints generated by PFGE were analyzed with visual
method and by the digitalized method by Gel-Pro version
3.1 software. The obtained results were submitted to MVSP
software generating dendrogram according to simple
matching coefﬁcient and UPGMA algorithm.

2.6. Other molecular typing methods of S. aureus isolates

Spa-typing was performed in all S. aureus isolates as
elsewhere described (Harmsen et al., 2003). The poly-
morphic X region of spa gene was ampliﬁed by PCR, and
sequences were analyzed using Ridom Staph-Type soft-
ware version 1.5.21 (Ridom GmbH), which automatically
detects spa repeats and assigns a spa-type according to
http://spaserver.ridom.de/.

369

Identiﬁcation of agr allele group (I–IV) was determined
by multiplex PCR as earlier described (Shopsin et al., 2003).
Multilocus-sequence-typing (MLST) was performed in
selected S. aureus isolates (in all 5 MRSA and in one
isolate of each detected spa-type). The allelic proﬁle of
each strain was obtained by sequencing internal frag-
ments of 7 unlinked housekeeping genes (arcC, aroE, glpF,
gmk, pta, tpi, and yqiL). Alleles of the 7 genes deﬁned
the allelic proﬁle, which corresponded to a sequence
type (ST) assigned by the MLST database (http://
www.mlst.net).

2.7. Detection of staphylococcal toxin genes

All isolates were tested by PCR for the presence of 18
genes coding for staphylococcal enterotoxins (sea, seb, sec,
sed, see, seg, seh, sei, sej, sek, sel, sem, sen, seo, sep, seq, ser and
seu), tst gene encoding the TSST (Hwang et al., 2007), lukS-
lukF genes encoding PVL leukocidin,
lukE-lukD genes
encoding the bicomponent leukotoxin LukE-LukD, lukM
gene encoding leukocidin M, as well as eta and etb genes
encoding exfoliative ETA and ETB toxins, respectively, and
hla, hlb, hld, hlg and hlgv genes encoding haemolysin toxins
(Jarraud et al., 2002).

2.8. Detection of the immune-evasion-gene-cluster (IEC)

All isolates were tested by PCR for the presence of six
genes (chp, sak, sea, sep, scn and hlb) encoding the IEC, that
allows its classiﬁcation into seven IEC types (from A to G),
as previously reported (Van Wamel et al., 2006).

3. Results

3.1. Field survey results for S. aureus isolates from sheep

Among the 163 nasal samples of sheep tested in this
study, 73 of them were positive for S. aureus recovery
(44.8%), and one isolate per sample was further studied.
Five of these S. aureus isolates were MRSA (3% of tested
animals), and the remaining 68 isolates were MSSA (41.7%
of tested animals).

3.2. Characteristics of MRSA detected in this study

All 5 MRSA isolates showed indistinguishable or
closely related patterns and they were ascribed to spa-
type t044, sequence type ST153 (included in clonal
complex CC80) and agrIII (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The SCCmec
cassette of these 5 MRSA was not typeable by the
employed methods in this study. These strains presented
resistance, in addition to beta-lactams, to streptomycin,
kanamycin, erythromycin, and clindamycin (inducible
type) and four of them to tetracycline and fusidic acid, and
harboured the genes blaZ, ant(6)-Ia, aph(30)-IIIa, erm(C),
tet(K), and fusB, respectively. The fusA gene identiﬁed in
the 4 fusidic-acid-resistant MRSA isolates did not show
mutations in its sequence that could justify this resistance
phenotype. Additionally, they also contained the lukS-lukF
genes encoding the Panton-Valentine leukocidin, as well
as the luk-ED, hla, hld and hlgv virulence genes. These

MRSA strains also presented the ability to coagulate
bovine plasma. In addition, they carried the sak, hlb and
scn genes and were classiﬁed into the immune-evasion-
gene-cluster IEC type E.

3.3. Characteristics of MSSA detected in this study

The characteristics of the 68 MSSA isolates recovered in
this study are shown in Table 1. All 68 MSSA were
submitted to spa-typing and 9 different spa-types were
detected (number of isolates): t1534 (18), t1773 (19),
t3576 (17), t5428 (6), t967 (4), t267 (1), and t223 (1), with
two new ones registered as t7579 (1) and t7630 (1).

Ampliﬁcation of the agr locus showed that agr group I
was predominant (detected in 47 of 68 MSSA isolates,
69.1%), being the remaining isolates ascribed to agr group
III.

Analysis of SmaI macrorestriction proﬁles of the 68
MSSA isolates revealed 16 different PFGE patterns (Fig. 1).
These patterns were classiﬁed from S2 to S17, each
deﬁning a clone. The pulsotype S9 was the most frequently
detected one (26% of isolates, 19 isolates), followed by the
pulsotype S4b (12.3% of isolates, 9 isolates) and pulsotype
S2b (11% of isolates, 8 isolates). PFGE showed a high
clonality among strains with the same spa-type, except in
the strains belonging to spa-type t3576 which were
ascribed to 5 different pulsotypes.

Eight different sequence-types were identiﬁed by MLST
among MSSA, six of them being new and registered as
ST2056, ST2057, ST2076, ST2078, ST2079, and ST2083
(Table 1).

All MSSA strains presented the ability to coagulate
bovine plasma. Only one of the 68 MSSA isolates carried
the genes of the IEC system and the positive strain
contained the genes sak, chp, hlb and scn, and consequently
was classiﬁed into the IEC type B, according to previously
referred criteria (Van Wamel et al., 2006). This IEC-positive
strain belonged to sequence type ST2076.

3.4. Characterization of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms
and virulence genes among MSSA

Most of MSSA (82.4%) showed susceptibility to the
tested antimicrobial agents, with the following exceptions:
penicillin (6% of isolates, carrying blaZ gene), tetracycline
(19%, carrying tetK gene), and fusidic acid (9%). All 5 MRSA
and 68 MSSA isolates showed susceptibility to vancomy-
cin,
tobramycin, mupirocin,
chloramphenicol, amikacin, ciproﬂoxacin and trimetho-
prim-sulfamethoxazole.

teicoplanin, gentamicin,

Fifty-three of 68 MSSA carried the tst gene (78%),
encoding TSST, and none of them were PVL positive. Other
virulence genes carried by MSSA isolates were: luk-M (61
isolates, 89,7%), luk-ED, hla, hlb, hld, and hlgv (67 isolates,
98,5%), hlg (1 isolate, 1,5%), sec (48 isolates, 70,6%), sel (51
isolates, 75%), and the ecg cluster-like: sen-sem-sei-seo-seg
(1 isolate, 1,5%). In contrast, 13 virulence genes were
absent among our staphylococci: sea, seb, sek, sep, seq, see,
seu, seh, sed, sej, ser, eta and etb.

No relation was found between the presence of

virulence genes and antimicrobial resistance.

4. Discussion

The high recovery rate of S. aureus detected among
nasal samples of healthy sheep in this study (44.8%),
including PVL-positive MRSA isolates, is of relevance and
represents, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst study of this type
performed in Tunisia. Previous works carried out in France
and in Saudi Arabia in healthy sheep showed a lower nasal
carriage of S. aureus (29% and 37.5%, respectively) (Vautor
et al., 2005; Alzohairy, 2011).

The 5 MRSA strains recovered in our study were typed
as ST153-t044 (single-locus variant of ST80), and agr type
III, and harboured the genes encoding PVL. ST153 belongs
to the clonal complex CC80, one of the major PVL-positive
community acquired-MRSA lineages disseminated world-
wide. It is of interest to remark that the clone CC80-t044
detected in our animal samples were frequently detected
among community associated-MRSA in Tunisia in a
previous study (Ben Nejma et al., 2008), as well as in
other countries (Deurenberg and Stobberingh, 2008). In
addition, the unique MRSA detected in healthy humans in
Tunisia in a previous study (a veterinarian working with
farm animals) was of the same clonal complex CC80
(although of different sequence type and spa-type) (Ben
Slama et al., 2011). Some authors refer that S. aureus of the
clone CC80 frequently shows resistance to tetracycline,
streptomycin, kanamycin and fusidic acid (with the
presence of the gene fusB), but not to gentamicin (McLaws
et al., 2011), as four of the 5 MRSA isolates detected in our
study.

Eight STs were identiﬁed among the MSSA strains, with
6 new STs detected. There are few data about the two
remaining already-known STs but there seems to be an
association between these clonal
lineages and farm
animals. ST700 detected in 20 of our MSSA isolates was
previously identiﬁed in one strain recovered from one goat
and belongs to CC130, which animal origin has been
suggested (Shore et al., 2011). ST1476 lineage detected in
one of our MSSA isolates belongs to CC97, which is mainly
related to ruminants. This ST and CC have been also
identiﬁed in Italian pig holdings and in Spanish pigs
(Battisti et al., 2010; Go´ mez-Sanz et al., 2010).

Additionally, no MRSA ST398 was detected among our
strains, clonal lineage related to farm animals (Go´ mez-
Sanz et al., 2010; Lozano et al., 2011). This genetic lineage is
mostly detected among pigs and cattle, and as far as we
know,
it has not been previously identiﬁed in sheep
samples.

There is association between speciﬁc lineages of S.
aureus and speciﬁc animal species. For Islamic countries, as
it is the case of Tunisia, that do not consume pork, sheep is
a very important agriculture animal species and the meat
of sheep represents half of the total red meat consumed in
Tunisia, according to recent published data (Brahmi et al.,
2010). Important differences in the type of agricultural
animals and type of consumed red meat do exist in
European countries comparing to those of the Islamic
culture.

The capacity of coagulate bovine plasma detected in our
MRSA and MSSA isolates is a characteristic previously
reported for small ruminants and bovine S. aureus ecovars

(Guinane et al., 2010); the referred authors associated this
capacity with the presence of a novel staphylococcal
pathogenicity island (SaPlov2), which was detected in their
study in S. aureus strains of the clonal complex CC133, a
well adapted clone to the bovine ecosystem. According to
our results, it seems that other clonal complexes recovered
from sheep might harbour this SaPlov2 element or similar
ones, due to the fact that all our strains (of clonal
complexes different from CC133) showed also the capacity
to coagulate bovine plasma.

Beside the presence of lukS-lukF genes, coding for PVL
toxin in the 5 MRSA isolates, several other virulence genes
were detected in our MSSA isolates. The high percentage of
tst-positive strains detected in our study (78% of MSSA) is
in agreement with the results found by other authors in
sheep (Vautor et al., 2009), but it is higher than the results
obtained in MSSA strains from human nasal samples (Ben
Slama et al., 2011).

Remarkably, most of the strains which harboured the tst
gene also contained the luk-M, luk-ED, sec and sel genes.
These genes might be either located in the same or
associated genetic element or be somehow related to the
identiﬁed clonal lineages. A relation among tst, sec and sel
genes has been observed in many studies and it is known
that there is a pathogenic island which encodes them
(SaPI2) (Orden et al., 1992). On the other hand, the operon
egc (enterotoxin gene cluster) which contains the seg-sei-
sem-sen-seo genes (Hwang et al., 2007; Vautor et al., 2009)
was only detected in one of our strains. This cluster is
considered as a putative source of superantigen in S.
aureus, being a possible source of new SE genes which are
responsible for the horizontal transfer of virulence and/or
antimicrobial resistance genes among S. aureus strains
(Jarraud et al., 2001; U´ beda et al., 2005). Studies on MSSA
human strains have detected a higher prevalence of this
operon and it seems to be linked to the clonal background
(Holtfreter et al., 2007). All strains except for the one which
harboured the egc cluster presented hla, hld and hlgv genes,
and 93% of them the hlb gene. These toxins are produced by
most of S. aureus strains (Dinges et al., 2000). No positive
strains were obtained for the remaining toxin genes tested
(sea, seb, sek, sep, seq, see, seu, seh, sed, sej, ser, eta and etb).
All our MRSA strains (typed as ST153) and one of the 68
MSSA strains (typed as ST2076) carried the IEC system
(type E or B). In previous studies it has been documented
that IEC has an extremely high incidence among clinical
human S. aureus strains (Van Wamel et al., 2006).
According with our results, it seems that this IEC system
is very scarcely distributed in MSSA sheep isolates but in
those MRSA ones. This system is mobilized by bacter-
iophages that integrate the genes of IEC cluster in the gene
hlb of S. aureus (Van Wamel et al., 2006).

Most of our MSSA showed susceptibility to the
antimicrobials tested with few exceptions. The low level
of penicillin resistance detected among our isolates
contrast with the high frequency of this type of resistance
reported for human isolates, even in commensal ones (Ben
Slama et al., 2011; Lozano et al., 2011). The ﬁnding of
tetracycline resistance among 23% of our S. aureus isolates
could be explained by the high use of this antibiotic in
animal industry. In regards to fusidic acid resistance, the

rate found in different countries is very variable, with
percentages ranging from 0.3% to 52.5% (Chen et al., 2010).
No mutations in elongation factor G have been detected in
the fusA sequences of the analyzed fusidic acid resistant S.
aureus isolates.

In conclusion, the nares of healthy sheep could be a
reservoir of PVL-positive MRSA isolates and also of S.
aureus isolates carrying tst, sec and sel genes. More studies
should be performed in the future to gain knowledge in the
genetic lineages of S. aureus circulating among healthy
animals, as well as in the capacity of these strains to
produce virulence factors, due to the risk of animal-to-
human bacterial transference.
