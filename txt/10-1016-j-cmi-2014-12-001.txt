Abstract 

Staphylococcus  schweitzeri  has  been  recently  considered  to  be  a  highly  divergent 

Staphylococcus aureus clade and usually colonizes non-human primates and bats in 

sub-Saharan Africa; yet, its transmissibility to humans remains unclear. We therefore 

investigated  the  transmission  of  S.  aureus  and  S.  schweitzeri  between  humans, 

domestic animals and wildlife in three remote African regions.  

A  cross  sectional  study  on  nasal  and  pharyngeal  colonization  in  humans  (n=1288) 

and  animals  (n=698)  was  performed  in  Côte  d’Ivoire,  Gabon  and  Democratic 

Republic of Congo (DR Congo). Isolates were subjected to spa typing and multilocus 

sequence  typing.  Antimicrobial  susceptibility  and  selected  virulence  factors  were 

tested. 

S.  schweitzeri  was  found  in  monkeys  from  all  study  sites  but  no  transmission  to 

humans  was  evident,  despite  frequent  contact  of  humans  to  wildlife.  In  contrast, 

human  associated  S.  aureus  sequence  types  (ST1,  ST6,  ST15)  were  detected  in 

domestic  animals  and  non-human  primates,  pointing  towards  a  human  to  monkey 

transmission  in  the  wild.  The  proportion  of  methicillin  resistant  S.  aureus  (MRSA) 

among all S. aureus was 0% (Gabon), 1.7% (DR Congo) and 5.3% (Côte d’Ivoire). 

The majority of MRSA isolates belonged to the African clone ST88. 

In conclusion, we did not find any evidence for a transmission of S. schweitzeri from 

animals to humans. However, such a transmission might remain possible due to the 

close  phylogenetic  relation  of  humans  and  non-human  primates.  The  ST88-MRSA 

clone was widespread in Côte d’Ivoire but not in Gabon and DR Congo.

Introduction 

Staphylococcus  aureus  is  part  of  the  normal  flora  of  animals  and  humans  and  can 

cause  a  multitude  of  infections  ranging  from  superficial  skin  infections  to  invasive 

diseases.  Colonization  is  a  risk  factor  for  subsequent  infection  of  the  homologous 

strain which is frequently found in the anterior nares [1;2].  

Transmission  of  S.  aureus  and  its  methicillin  resistant  variant  (MRSA)  between 

animals  and  humans  has  been  frequently  reported  in  industrialized  countries 

particularly  in  regions  with  high  densities  of  livestock.  Not  only  the  livestock-

associated  MRSA  (LA-MRSA,  CC398)  but  also  community-associated  MRSA  (CA-

MRSA,  CC97)  can  be  transmitted  from  mammals  (i.  e.  pigs,  cattle)  and    poultry  to 

humans where it is as pathogenic as other S. aureus lineages [3;4].  

Recently,  a  highly-divergent  S.  aureus  clade  was  described  in  bats,  monkeys  and 

great apes in sub-Sahara Africa and is now considered to be a new species termed 

Staphylococcus schweitzeri [5-7].  S. schweitzeri has similar biochemical properties 

as S. aureus (i. e. catalase and coagulase positive), can be genotyped by spa typing 

and multilocus sequence typing but differ from S. aureus at the whole genome level 

and the peptidoglycan type [5;7]. An isolate of a divergent S. aureus clade which has 

been retrospectively confirmed as S. schweitzeri was found once in a human carrier 

in Gabon [8]. Close contacts of humans to animals might facilitate the cross species 

transmission  of  S.  aureus  and  S.  schweitzeri  for  instance  when  preparing  and 

consuming  meat  (e.  g.  monkeys).  The  extraction  and  consumption  of  wildlife 

(“bushmeat”)  is  common  in  sub-Saharan  Africa,  particularly  in  remote  regions  [9]. 

However,  the  transmission  of  S.  aureus  and  S.  schweitzeri  between  animals  and 

humans  in  remote  African  regions  is  unclear.  The  objective  of  this  study  was  to 

investigate the population structure and transmission of S. aureus and S. schweitzeri

Material and Methods 

Ethical clearance 

Ethical clearance was obtained from the ”Comité d’Éthique Institutionnel, Centre de 

Recherches  Médicales  de  Lambaréné,  Gabon”  (CEI-MRU  001/2011),  the  “Comité 

National d’Éthique et de la Recherche (CNER), Ministère de la Santé et de l’Hygiène 

100 

Publique,  République  de  Côte  d’Ivoire”  (101  10/MSHP/CENR/P)  and  ”Comité 

101 

d’Éthique,  Ministère  de  l’Enseignement  Supérieur  et  Universitaire,  République 

102 

Démocratique du Congo" (ESO/CE/018/11). 

103 

A  written  informed  consent  was  signed  or  fingerprinted  by  each  participant  before 

104 

enrolment. If the participant was illiterate or did not speak French, a local interpreter 

105 

explained  the  study  procedures.  An  independent  witness  signed  additionally  the 

106 

consent form in these cases. 

107 

 

108 

Study design 

109 

A population-based cross sectional study was performed in Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon and 

110 

DR  Congo  to  take  nasal  and  pharyngeal  swabs  from  humans  and  animals.  The 

111 

studied  populations  are  characterized  by  a  limited  access  to  official  documentation 

112 

and  health  care  and,  with  the  exception  of  the  Ivorian  population,  rare  contacts  to 

113 

urban  civilization.  Subsistence  farming  and  hunting  are  essential  parts  of  their 

114 

lifestyle. 

115 

In  Côte  d’Ivoire,  participants  were  recruited  and  animals  were  sampled  in  eight 

116 

villages  (Daobly,  Gahably,  Gouliako,  Keibly,  Pauleoula,  Ponan,  Tai,  Zaipobly)  in 

117 

close proximity to Taï National Park from 4/2012-10/2012 (Figure 1).  

118 

In  DR  Congo,  samples  were  taken  from  humans  and  animals  in  seven  villages 

119 

(Bekombo, Bungosani, Ipopé, Iyoko, Lompolé, Lui Kotale, Nganda) at the border of 

120 

“Salonga-Sud”  National  Park  from  07/2011-9/2011  (Figure  1).  In  Côte  d’Ivoire  and 

 

6 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT121 

DR Congo, domestic animals were alive and lived in the same villages as the human 

122 

participants.  Wildlife  was  dead  and  hunted  for  consumption  as  “bushmeat”  on  the 

123 

same day when samples were taken. 

124 

In  Gabon,  Babongo  pygmies  were  recruited  in  six  villages  (Village  tranquille, 

125 

Tsibanga,  Ossimba,  Ndougou,  Soga,  Egouba)  in  Waka  National  Park  in  10/2011. 

126 

Samples  from  animals  were  collected  from  2010-2013  in  the  provinces  Moyen 

127 

Ogooué and Ngounié where Waka National Park is located (Figure 1).  

128 

All  participants  were  included  if  they  consented  to  enrolment.  No  exclusion  criteria 

129 

were  applied.  Demographic  data  and  data  on  contact  to  animals  (e.g.  history  of 

130 

animal bites) were recorded in standardized questionnaires.  

131 

 

132 

Bacterial isolates 

133 

Swabs were taken by gently rubbing a sterile cotton tip in circular moves against the 

134 

nasal septum of the anterior nares and the pharyngeal mucosa. 

135 

In  Gabon,  samples  were  stored  in  Amies  transport  medium  (Transwabs,  Medical 

136 

Wire, Corsham, UK) until culture within a maximum of two days in the microbiology 

137 

laboratory at the Albert Schweitzer Hospital, Lambaréné. Swabs from DR Congo and 

138 

Côte d’Ivoire were stored in STTG medium in liquid nitrogen and shipped to Germany 

139 

for culture.  

140 

All samples were cultured on Columbia blood agar plates, Columbia CAP selective 

141 

agar  plates  (Oxoid,  Wesel,  Germany)  and  SAID  agar  plates  (bioMérieux,  Marcy 

142 

l’Etoile, France) for 18-36 h at 36±1 °C. 

143 

Presumptive  colonies  were  screened  for  a  positive  catalase  and  agglutination  test 

144 

(Pastorex  Staph-Plus,  Bio-Rad,  Marnes-la-Coquette,  France).  Species  identification 

145 

and  susceptibility  test  (EUCAST  breakpoints)  were  done  using  Vitek  2  automated 

146 

systems  (bioMérieux).  Species  of  S.  aureus  was  confirmed  by  the  detection  of  the 

 

7 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT147 

nuc gene [10]. Identification of S. schweitzeri was based on the lack of nuc detection, 

148 

its  phylogenetic  divergent  position  using  multilocus  sequence  typing  and  a  similar 

149 

biochemical profile as S. aureus as assessed with GP ID Card (bioMérieux) [7].  

150 

Carriers  were  defined  as  a  human  or  animal  being  colonized  in  the  nose  and/or 

151 

throat. If an individual was colonized with an identical isolate at different body sites 

152 

(based on spa typing), one isolate was included in the final analysis in order to report 

153 

non-duplicate isolates only. 

154 

 

155 

Molecular characterization 

156 

Genes  encoding  selected  virulence  factors  were  detected  by  multiplex  PCRs  [11]. 

157 

Methicillin resistance was confirmed by the detection of mecA, all MRSA were tested 

158 

for arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) [12;13]. All isolates were spa typed and 

159 

multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was done exemplarily for one isolate of each spa 

160 

type in each country and each group (humans, animals) [14;15]. The concatenated 

161 

sequences  of  MLST  housekeeping  genes  were  used  to  construct  a  Neighbour 

162 

Joining  Tree  (MEGA5,  http://www.megasoftware.net).  The  divergence  between  two 

163 

groups was assessed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood model (MEGA5). 

164 

 

165 

Statistics 

166 

Antimicrobial  resistance  rates  were  compared  between  animals  and  humans  using 

167 

Pearson’s  chi-square  test  or  Fisher’s  exact  test,  the  software  ‘R’  (http://cran.r-

168 

project.org, Version: 2.13.1) and the package EPICALC.

Results 

170 

In total, 1288 participants and 698 animals were sampled in Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon and 

171 

DR  Congo  (Figure  1,  Table1).  The  median  age  of  humans  ranged  from  15  years 

172 

(Gabon) to 30 years (Côte d’Ivoire). Human S. aureus colonization rates were similar 

173 

in  Gabon  (34.0%,  n=35)  and  Côte  d’Ivoire  (32.4%,  n=222)  but  lower  in  DR  Congo 

174 

(21.4%,  n=  107).  While  animal  bites  were  not  recorded  for  participants  from  DR 

175 

Congo, 3.9% (n=4, Gabon) and 20.7% (n=142, Côte d’Ivoire) had a history of animal 

176 

injuries  (Table 1). The  majority  reported  snake  bites  (8.2%, n=65), followed  by  dog 

177 

bites (4.6%, n=36) and bites by non-human primates (0.9%, n=7).  

178 

The distribution of sampled domestic animals (i. e. ruminants, fowls, dogs, cats) and 

179 

wildlife  (i.  e.  non-human  primates,  rodents,  ruminants,  reptiles)  was  heterogeneous 

180 

among  all  study  sites.  The  proportion  of  domestic  animals  among  all  animals  was 

181 

highest  in  Côte  d’Ivoire  (90.3%,  n=501),  while  wildlife  was  predominant  in  Gabon 

182 

(90.8%,  n=116)  and  DR  Congo  (88%,  n=11,  Table  1).  S.  aureus  colonization  rates 

183 

were  highest  in  ruminants  (19.6%,  n=54)  followed  by  non-human  primates  (19.0%, 

184 

n=15), cats (7.1%, n=3) and dogs (3.0%, n=3). S. schweitzeri was only found in non-

185 

human primates which were colonized in 26.6% (n=21). 

186 

Nine  human  carriers  had  a  culture-confirmed  S.  aureus  skin  infection.  The  same 

187 

strain  (based  on  spa  typing)  of  the  skin  lesion  was  also  found  in  the  nose  and/or 

188 

throat of six participants.  Three participants with a skin infection were not colonized.  

189 

The  staphylococcal  isolates  were  separated  into  two  phylogenetic  groups.  Group  1 

190 

included  495  S.  aureus  isolates  predominated  by  ST152  (17.4%,  n=86),  ST15 

191 

(16.8%,  n=83)  and  ST5  (10.9%,  n=54).  Animal  species  which  carried  isolates 

192 

belonging  to  group  1  were  dogs  (Canis  sp.),  goats  (Capra  sp.),  guenons 

193 

(Cercopithecus  sp.),  mangabeys  (Lophocebus  sp.),  talapoins  (Miopithecus  sp.)  and 

 

9 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT194 

sheep  (Ovis  sp.,  Table  S1).  The  habitat  regions  of  these  species  are  terrestrial  or 

195 

semi terrestrial.   

196 

The  divergent  group  2  consisted  of  24  S.  schweitzeri  isolates  and ST2295  (16.7%, 

197 

n=4),  ST1872,  ST1874  and  ST2474  (each  8.3%,  n=2)  were  predominant.  All  S. 

198 

schweitzeri  isolates  were  isolated  from  non-human  primates  and  were  nuc  PCR 

199 

negative. The mean distance between group 1 and 2 was 0.083 base substitutions 

200 

per site. Within group 1, we detected a cluster of monkey associated STs (ST1838, 

201 

ST1851,  ST1854,  ST1925,  ST2721).  Of  these,  only  isolates  belonging  to  ST1854 

202 

were nuc negative. Of note, two ST395 isolates from human carriers were also nuc 

203 

negative.  Isolates  from  wildlife  and  domestic  animals  were  distinctly  scattered  in 

204 

group  1  which  is  dominated  by  isolates  from  humans.  In  contrast,  no  isolates  from 

205 

humans were found in group 2 (Figure 2).   

206 

S. aureus belonging to ST1, ST5, ST6, ST8, ST15, ST101, ST121, ST152, ST188, 

207 

ST567  and  ST1472  were  found  in  humans,  domestic  animals  and/or  wildlife.  A 

208 

possible transmission of these isolates between humans and animals was assessed 

209 

by  spa  typing  which  has  a  higher  discriminatory  power  than  MLST  (Table  2). 

210 

Transmission of S. aureus occurred more frequently between humans and domestic 

211 

animals  than  between  humans  and  wildlife.  S.  schweitzeri  isolates  were  not  found 

212 

amongst humans or domestic animals (Table 2). 

213 

One early branching isolate (ST2353, nuc negative) from a 14 year-old female carrier 

214 

in  DR  Congo  did  not  cluster  with  any  group  (Figure  2).  The  delineation  of  ST2353 

215 

from group 1, the closest related clade, was supported by a bootstrap value of 100% 

216 

(supporting material, Figure S1). The average distance of ST2353 from ST152 and 

217 

ST2022  (taken  as  reference  STs  from  group  1  and  2,  respectively)  was  0.035  and 

218 

0.054  base  substitution  per  site,  respectively.  ST2353  had  an  isolated  position 

219 

regarding  the  MLST  allelic  profile; the  closest  relatives  were  ST1857, ST2022, and 

 

10 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT220 

ST2295 which were quadruple locus variants of ST2353. ST2353 was more similar to 

221 

typical  S.  aureus  STs  than  to  S.  schweitzeri,  Staphylococcus  simiae  or  the  early 

222 

branching ST1223 and ST1850 (Figure S1). 

223 

Antimicrobial  resistance  was  only  detected  in  S.  aureus  but  not  in  S.  schweitzeri 

224 

(Table  3).  Overall,  the  antimicrobial  resistance  rates  were  higher  in  S.  aureus from 

225 

humans compared to animals for penicillin (57.3 vs. 81.7%, p<0.005), cefoxitin (1.1 

226 

vs. 4.7%, p=0.2) and cotrimoxazol (23.6 vs. 31.4%, p=0.15). 

227 

Compared to the pygmy population in Gabon, S. aureus from Côte d’Ivoire and DR 

228 

Congo  showed  higher  resistance  rates  to  penicillin,  cotrimoxazol  and  tetracyclin 

229 

(Table 3). The MRSA rate was 5.3% (Côte d’Ivoire) and 1.7% (DR Congo). No MRSA 

230 

was  detected  in  the  Gabonese  population.  In  Côte  d’Ivoire,  94.1%  (n=16)  of  all 

231 

MRSA belonged to ST88 (t186, t786, PVL negative). One MRSA isolate was isolated 

232 

from a sheep (ST2947, t186, PVL negative, Table 3). In DR Congo, the two MRSA 

233 

were  isolated  from  humans  and  belonged  to  ST8  (t1476,  PVL  negative,  ACME 

234 

negative).  

235 

In methicillin susceptible S. aureus, PVL was the most prevalent virulence factor (25-

236 

40.4%,  Table  3).  Only  the  enterotoxins  encoding  genes  (seb,  sec)  and  toxic  shock 

237 

syndrome toxin (tst) were found in S. schweitzeri isolates (Table 3).

Discussion 

239 

Our study assessed a possible transmission of S. aureus and S. schweitzeri between 

240 

humans,  domestic  animals  and  wildlife  in  three  remote  African  regions.  We  found 

241 

evidence  that  transmission  of  S.  aureus  between  humans  and  domestic  animals 

242 

could occur. S. schweitzeri was frequently found in non-human primates but was not 

243 

detected in humans despite frequent exposure to bushmeat. 

244 

In  human  participants,  3.9-20.7%  reported  animal  bites  in  the  past  which  is  in  line 

245 

with  a  report  from  Uganda  where  19.3%  reported  injuries  or  close  contact  with 

246 

primates  [16].  Not  only  injuries  by  wild  animals  but  also  bushmeat  hunting  and 

247 

consumption are risk factors for the transmission of pathogens between animals and 

248 

humans [9]. Bushmeat trade and consumption is highest in West and Central Africa. 

249 

Approximately  300  g  bushmeat  are  consumed  per  person  per  day  in  the  Congo 

250 

Basin resulting in 4.5 million tons of extracted bushmeat per year [9]. Therefore, our 

251 

remote  studied  populations  can  be  considered  as  populations  with  a  high  risk  to 

252 

becoming exposed to zoonotic pathogens from wildlife. 

253 

We and others recently reported a highly divergent S. aureus clade in African non-

254 

human  primates  and  bats  which  is  now  considered  to  be  a  new  species  S. 

255 

schweitzeri [5;6]. S. schweitzeri harbours a nuc homologue with similar thermostable 

256 

nuclease  activity  as  S.  aureus  [17].  Despite  frequent  exposures  to  non-human 

257 

primates  we  did  not  find  S.  schweitzeri  in  humans.  In  contrast,  some  isolates  from 

258 

monkeys  clustered  with  typical  human-associated  isolates  (i.  e.  ST1,  ST6,  ST15, 

259 

Figure 2).  This finding suggests that a transmission from humans to animals is more 

260 

likely than vice versa. This transmission could be facilitated by overlapping habitats of 

261 

humans  (terrestrial),  domestic  animals  (terrestrial)  and  wildlife  (terrestrial  and  semi 

262 

terrestrial,  Table  S1).  It  is  also  possible  that  animal-associated  lineages  were 

263 

transmitted  to  humans  where  they  clonally  expanded.  However,  the  polyclonal 

 

12 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT264 

population structure in humans argues against this scenario. As the monkeys have 

265 

been  hunted  and  handled  by  humans,  we  cannot  rule  out  that  these  animals  were 

266 

contaminated  with  S.  aureus  after  death  and  did  not  carry  human-associated  S. 

267 

aureus lineages during lifetime. We rank this possibility as low, as swabs were taken 

268 

from  anterior  nares  and  throat  which  are  usually  not  touched  by  humans  during 

269 

handling  of  bushmeat.  However,  easily  accessible  body  sites  of  monkeys  might 

270 

remain subject of contamination by humans.  

271 

A  transmission  of  S.  aureus  from  humans  to  great  apes  has  been  reported  from 

272 

African  sanctuaries  and  research  centres  in  Uganda,  Zambia  and  Gabon  [18;19]. 

273 

While direct skin contact of humans and animals might be the transmission route in 

274 

captive  animals,  other  paths  might  apply  for  a  transmission  to  wild  non-human 

275 

primates. Contacts of wild animals with human faeces or secretions, either directly or 

276 

through  soil  or  water  could  facilitate  a  transmission.  One  study  from  Uganda 

277 

confirmed a transmission of Escherichia coli between humans, livestock and gorillas 

278 

[20].  In  contrast,  a  study  from  Gabon  did  not  show  any  evidence  for  such  a 

279 

transmission of E. coli from human faeces to wildlife through soil and surface waters 

280 

[21].  

281 

In a human carrier from DR Congo, we found an early branching ST2353 which was 

282 

unrelated to other early branching S. aureus isolates (ST1223, ST1850) [22;23]. To 

283 

the  best  of  our  knowledge,  similar  STs  have  not  been  reported  yet.  The  closest 

284 

related STs are quadruple locus variants of ST2353 and cluster in group 2 (Figure 2). 

285 

To resolve the phylogenetic position of this ST, comparative whole genome analyses 

286 

are warranted. 

287 

The resistance rates to antimicrobial agents differed markedly between isolates from 

288 

the  three  studied  populations  and  between  S.  aureus  and  S.  schweitzeri.  There 

289 

seemed  to  be  a  trend  from  low  (Gabon),  medium  (DR  Congo)  and  high  (Côte 

 

13 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT290 

d’Ivoire) levels of antimicrobial resistance in S. aureus which might mirror the contact 

291 

with  healthcare  institutions  and  access  to  antibiotics.  The  high  resistance  rates  to 

292 

penicillin (89.5%) and cefoxitin (5.3%) in S. aureus from Côte d’Ivoire correspond to 

293 

resistance rates in urban populations in Gabon (penicillin resistance: 95%, methicillin 

294 

resistance:  3%),  Nigeria  (methicillin  resistance:  8%)  or  Kenya  (penicillin  resistance: 

295 

69.8%,  methicillin  resistance:  7%)  [8;24;25].  Almost  all  MRSA  isolates  from  Côte 

296 

d’Ivoire  belonged  to  ST88  (94.1%).  The  ST88-MRSA-III/IV  is  widely  distributed  in 

297 

sub-Saharan Africa and termed the “African MRSA clone” [26]. We isolated a ST88-

298 

MRSA from a sheep in Côte d’Ivoire; others found this lineage in pigs from Senegal 

299 

[27].  

300 

Although  our  study  is  valuable  to  understand  the  transmission  of  S.  aureus  and  S. 

301 

schweitzeri  between  animals  and  humans,  some  limitations  need  to  be  addressed. 

302 

First,  we  were  unable  to  include  data  on  animal  exposure  and  bites  of  the  studied 

303 

population in DR Congo. We assume that this population has similar exposures and 

304 

contacts to wildlife as the Gabonese pygmies due to similar living conditions. Second, 

305 

the  cross  sectional  study  design  limits  conclusion  regarding  the  direction  of 

306 

transmission.  Future  longitudinal  studies  are  therefore  warranted.  Third,  since  one 

307 

spa 

type  can  belong 

to  different  MLST  sequence 

types  we  might  have 

308 

underestimated the diversity of STs. Fourth, apart from the anterior nares and throat 

309 

we did not sample other typical S. aureus colonization sites (e. g.  hands, axilla, and 

310 

groin) and might have missed additional S. aureus carriers.  

311 

In conclusion, we provide evidence for a transmission of human-associated S. aureus 

312 

to  domestic  animals  and  to  some  extent  also  to  wildlife  in  rural  Africa.  No 

313 

transmission  of  the  monkey  associated  S.  schweitzeri  to  humans  was  detected, 

314 

although the studied populations have frequent contact to wildlife through bushmeat 

 

14 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT315 

hunting  and  consumption.  However,  S.  schweitzeri  might  have  a  zoonotic  potential 

316 

due to the close phylogenetic relation of humans and non-human primates.
