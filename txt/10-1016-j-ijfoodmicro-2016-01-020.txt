An epidemiological investigation of Salmonella spp. in pig and pork samples from one slaughterhouse and its
downstream retail markets in Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, China, was conducted from October 2013 to March
2014. A total of 71.8% (155/216) and 70.9% (78/110), respectively, of the slaughterhouse and retail market sam-
ples were recovered positive for Salmonella. All Salmonella isolates were characterized using serotyping, antimi-
crobial resistance detection, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE).
Seven serotypes were shared by isolates from the two sources, with the most common serotypes being Salmonella
Derby, Typhimurium, and Uganda. Antimicrobial sensitivity testing revealed that the highest antimicrobial resis-
tance rate was against tetracycline (49.7% and 37.2% in isolates from the slaughterhouse and retail market, respec-
tively) with many multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates in both sources. MLST analysis showed that eight sequence
type (ST) patterns were shared, and ST40 occupied an absolute superiority among isolates from both sources.
PFGE permitted the resolution of XbaI macrorestriction fragments of the selected 31 Salmonella Derby and 19
Salmonella Typhimurium into 30 and 10 distinct pulsotypes, displaying the high similarity between the isolates
from the two sources. Our ﬁndings indicated that Salmonella isolates from a slaughterhouse and its downstream
retail markets were phenotypically and genetically homologous. Additionally, Salmonella may propagate along
the slaughter line and pork production chain from the slaughterhouse to retail markets.

1. Introduction

Salmonella, one of the most important pathogens studied every year
in the world, can cause severe foodborne disease in humans and ani-
mals, impacting health and productivity (Majowicz et al., 2010). In
China, approximately 70 to 80% of foodborne pathogenic outbreaks
are caused by Salmonella (Wang et al., 2007). The majority of human
Salmonella infections are associated with the ingestion of contaminated
foods, such as pork, poultry, beef, egg, milk, cheese, and vegetables
(Zhao et al., 2008).

Pigs have been recognized as one important reservoir for Salmonella
(Li et al., 2013). Salmonella can be transferred to humans via pork along
the food chain (Hauser et al., 2011). Therefore, as one of the countries
with the largest pork production and consumption around the world,
great attention should be paid to the prevalence and control of

Salmonella with respect to pig slaughtering, pork manufacturing, and
retail in China.

In recent years, many studies reported the prevalence and character-
ization of Salmonella along the pork production chain; the contamina-
tion of Salmonella was 10 to 40% in slaughterhouses, and the major
serotypes were Salmonella Typhimurium and Derby (Algino et al.,
2009; Arguello et al., 2012; Bonardi et al., 2013; Duggan et al., 2010).
In retail markets, the prevalence of Salmonella isolates from pork sam-
ples was 1 to 40% (Li et al., 2014; Mihaiu et al., 2014; Miranda et al.,
2009; Thai et al., 2012), and the serovars were diverse.

Though much attention has been focused on Salmonella in pig
slaughterhouses and retail markets, intensive and simultaneous re-
search regarding the prevalence, serotypes, antimicrobial resistance,
multilocus sequence types (STs), and pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis
(PFGE) proﬁles of Salmonella in both sources is limited, especially in
China. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze the distribu-
tion, antimicrobial susceptibility proﬁles, and molecular characteristics
of Salmonella spp. collected from one pig slaughterhouse and its down-
stream pork retail markets in Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, China, to de-
termine the clonal relationships between isolates and the possible route
of exposure.

2. Material and methods

2.1. Sample collection

From October 2013 to March 2014, 326 samples were collected from
one slaughterhouse, which processed about 600 pigs per workday, and
its downstream retail markets in Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, China. The
sampling was separated into two parts.

i) From October 2013 to March 2014, 216 samples were collected at
ten different stages including lairage, submitting, scalding water,
cooling water, evisceration, visceral processing countertop, waste
water, carcass dressing, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), and ﬂoor
along the slaughter line. Samples were randomly taken during three
visits to the slaughterhouse every 2 months. All samples were collected
using sterile sponges that were pre-moistened with buffered peptone
water (BPW; Difco, BD, Sparks, MD, USA) as described previously
(Bonardi et al., 2013). To prevent cross-contamination, gloves were
worn during sampling and changed after each sample. Holding pens
were sampled using the overshoe method. Carcasses were swabbed in
each high-risk contamination area of 100 cm2 (heel, belly, hip, notum,
and jowl). Waste water, scalding and cooling water were sampled
using sterile tagged collection tubes once per hour, and the temperature
was measured. Ground specimens (visceral processing countertop
and ﬂoor of each stage) were sampled by swabbing an area of
50 cm × 50 cm within each location. MLNs were collected and processed
as previously reported (Anonymous, 2006). Samples were immediately
stored in a cooled container after collection and sent to the laboratory
for analysis.

ii) During the days after the slaughterhouse sampling, the retail sam-
ples were obtained. One hundred ten pork samples were collected from
two downstream retail markets. Sampling was performed as described
previously (Li et al., 2014). However, it was not possible to obtain both
pork types (chop and piece) because of their availability.

2.2. Isolation and identiﬁcation of Salmonella

For swab samples from the slaughterhouse, the pre-enrichment step
was performed by suspending each sample in 50 mL BPW, and incubat-
ing samples at 37 °C for 16 to 18 h. Then, 0.1 mL of the BPW suspensions
was subcultured in 10 mL subpackaged Rappaport–Vassiliadis (RV)
enrichment broth (Difco, BD, Sparks, MD, USA) at 42 °C for 24 h. One
loopful of each RV broth culture was then streaked onto xylose lysine
tergitol 4 (Difco, BD, Sparks, MD, USA) agar plates, which were incubat-
ed at 37 °C for 24 to 48 h. One presumptive Salmonella colony per plate
was picked and biochemically conﬁrmed using an API-20E test kit
(bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). All strains were serotyped accord-
ing to the Kauffmann–White scheme by slide agglutination with O and
H antigen-speciﬁc sera (Tianrun Bio-Pharmaceutical, Ningbo, China).
For pork samples from retail markets, each sample (25 ± 0.5 g) was
aseptically weighed and transferred into 225 mL BPW and incubated
at 37 °C for 18 h. The pre-enrichment and following isolation and iden-
tiﬁcation were performed as described above.

2.3. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

The Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion method was used to determine the
isolates' antimicrobial susceptibility (Li et al., 2014). A total of 14 antimi-
crobial agents were applied: ampicillin (AMP, 10 μg), cefazolin (CFZ,
30 μg), ceftriaxone (CRO, 30 μg), cefotaxime (CTX, 30 μg), gentamicin
(GEN, 10 μg), kanamycin (KAN, 20 μg), streptomycin (STR, 10 μg),
nalidixic acid (NAL, 30 μg), ciproﬂoxacin (CIP, 5 μg), oﬂoxacin (OFX,
5 μg), norﬂoxacin (NOR, 5 μg), chloramphenicol (CHL, 30 μg), tetracycline
(TET, 30 μg), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT, 1.25–23.75 μg).
Results were interpreted according to the established Clinical and Lab-
oratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines (CLSI, 2013).

2.4. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST)

Conﬁrmed isolates were grown aerobically in LB broth with shaking
overnight at 37 °C. Genomic DNA was extracted with a TIANamp
Bacteria DNA Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) in strict accordance with
the manufacturer's protocol. MLST was carried out as described online
(http://mlst.warwick.ac.uk/mlst/dbs/Senterica/documents/primers
Enterica_html). All polymerase chain reaction products were puriﬁed
and sequenced by Nanjing GenScript Biotech Co. (Nanjing, China), and
the alleles and STs were assigned according to the MLST scheme at
http://mlst.warwick.ac.uk/mlst/dbs/Senterica. A minimum spanning
tree was generated using BioNumerics software, version 6.5 (Applied
Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium) to analyze the distribution of STs in the
slaughterhouse and retail markets.

2.5. PFGE

PFGE was performed according to the protocol by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Ribot et al., 2006) with some
modiﬁcations. In brief, Salmonella isolates were streaked onto LB plates
and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The pathogen concentration was
modulated with bacterial suspensions until a McFarland turbidity of
4.0–4.5 was attained. DNA was digested with 50 U XbaI (Takara, Dalian,
China) at 37 °C for 3 h. The digested DNA was separated by electropho-
resis in 0.5 × TBE buffer at 14 °C for 20 h using a CHEF Mapper electro-
phoresis system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The pulse time was
ramped from 2.16 to 63.8 s. In addition, a control strain of Salmonella
Braenderup (H9812), which served as a molecular weight standard,
was processed with each batch of isolates. The gels were stained with
ethidium bromide, and DNA patterns were visualized on a UV trans-
illuminator (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Dendrograms were created by
BioNumerics software version 6.5 (Applied Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium)
using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic means. The
band-matching settings with optimization of 0.5% and position tolerance
of 1.5% were applied.

2.6. Data analysis

Statistical comparison of prevalence and individual resistance to the
14 antimicrobial agents of Salmonella isolates in the slaughterhouse and
retail markets were analyzed with the X2 test, which was performed
using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (version 15.0, SPSS,
Chicago, IL, USA) with P b 0.05 considered as statistically signiﬁcant.

and no signiﬁcant difference (P N 0.05) was found among the slaughter-
house samples from different visits.

Almost all the three slaughterhouse samplings the prevalence rate of
Salmonella was higher than 50.0% (Table 2). With regards to environ-
mental samples, Salmonella was found most frequently on cooling
water (100.0%). And for slaughtered pigs, Salmonella was found mostly
on carcass swab samples after submitting (100%), which was much
higher lymph node samples (11.1%).

Sixteen different serovars were identiﬁed among the 233 positive
Salmonella isolates (Table 3), which included 14 serovars from the
slaughterhouse and nine from retail markets. In total, seven serotypes
were shared in the two sources; these serotypes were Salmonella Derby,
Typhimurium, Meleagridis, Anatum, Uganda, Agona, and London. The
most common serotype recovered from both the slaughterhouse and re-
tail market samples was Salmonella Derby (27.1% and 38.5%); this was
followed by Typhimurium (26.5% and 14.1%). Meanwhile, some serovars
were exclusively found in one source; Salmonella Goldcoast were found in
pork only, and Salmonella Kottbus was present in only the slaughterhouse
samples.

3.2. Antimicrobial resistance phenotypes

The susceptibility of 233 isolates to 14 antimicrobial agents was
assessed (Table 4). Resistance to TET was the most commonly observed
resistance in both the slaughterhouse and retail market isolates (49.7%
and 37.2%). High rates of resistance were also noted for STR (35.5%
and 20.5%), NAL (14.8% and 34.6%) and SXT (26.5% and 11.5%). In

contrast, low level of resistance was found for CRO and CTX, which
were represented by two and three isolates, respectively.

A signiﬁcant high level of resistance to penicillins was found in
both slaughterhouse and retail market isolates relative to the rate of
resistance to cephalosporins (P = 0.00188 and 0.00149, respectively).
The similar level of resistance was observed for NAL.

A total of 97 (62.6%) and 50 (64.1%) of the Salmonella isolates from
the slaughterhouse and retail markets, respectively, were identiﬁed as
resistant to at least one antimicrobial (Table 5), with the most common
resistance patterns being TET and STR, and NAL only. The other main re-
sistance patterns were TET only; SXT and TET; and SXT, TET, and STR
in slaughterhouse isolates. In isolates from retail markets, the main
resistance patterns were TET only; NAL, CHL, and TET; and AMP, STR,
and TET. In total, we identiﬁed 37 and 23 discrete resistance patterns
in isolates from the slaughterhouse and retail markets, respectively.

Of the multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, 20 and 13 unique
MDR patterns were observed in slaughterhouse and retail market
isolates (Table 5), respectively, with most of them being Salmonella
Typhimurium and Derby. Of the slaughterhouse isolates, the most
frequent MDR pattern was SXT, NAL, GEN, KAN, AMP, CHL, TET, CIP,
and STR, which was represented by eight Salmonella Typhimurium
isolates, while that of retail market isolates was NAL, CHL, and TET,
represented by Salmonella Typhimurium as well.

3.3. MLST analysis

An interlinked dataset with partial sequencing of seven house-
keeping genes at 399 bp to 501 bp revealed that 18 STs among the
233 isolates were found, which included 15 from the slaughterhouse
and 11 from the retail markets. The number of unique alleles for the
various housekeeping genes ranged from 10 for sucA to 18 for dnaN
(Table 5). ST40 was the most common ST in this study, both in the
slaughterhouse and retail market isolates, and it was represented by
42 and 22 Salmonella isolates (Table 5), respectively.

The STs in this study were correlated with speciﬁc serovars such as
ST40 with Salmonella Derby, ST19 with Salmonella Typhimurium, and
ST463 with Salmonella Meleagridis. One ST corresponded to only one
serotype. For example, all of the strains that were typed as ST71 were
Salmonella Derby. In contrast, one serovar could be assigned to multiple
STs. For instance, 29 of 41 isolates from the slaughterhouse that were
characterized as Salmonella Typhimurium belonged to ST19, while the
remaining belonged to ST34.

Fig. 1. Minimum spanning tree analysis of Salmonella isolated from a slaughterhouse and retail markets. Each circle represents one ST, and the area of the circle corresponds to the number
of isolates. STs that were observed in the ﬁrst, second, and third visit of retail markets are represented by aqua, light blue, and yellow, respectively. STs that were observed in the ﬁrst,
second, and third slaughterhouse visit are represented by purple, red, and green, respectively. The gray region indicates that ST19 and ST34 belong to a clonal complex.

A minimum spanning tree of all STs from both sources was generat-
ed using BioNumerics version 6.5 (Fig. 1). ST40 was found in every visit
to both the slaughterhouse and retail markets, and it occupied an abso-
lute advantage in number. In total, eight STs were shared among the
slaughterhouse and retail market isolates, including ST13, ST19, ST34,
ST40, ST64, ST155, ST463, and ST684. ST14, ST32, ST279, ST469,
ST592, ST638, and ST808 were exclusive to the slaughterhouse isolates.
Among the retail market isolates, ST71, ST358, and ST1750 were unique.
In each batch of slaughterhouse and retail market samples, common STs
were always discovered in both sources. For instance, during the ﬁrst
visit, ST34, ST40, ST64, and ST684 were shared; in the second visit,
ST19, ST40, and ST64 were common.

3.4. PFGE analysis

12 to 15 XbaI fragments. Fig. 2 shows the PFGE ﬁngerprint proﬁles of
the selected Salmonella Derby isolates. For the 31 Salmonella Derby iso-
lates, 30 PFGE patterns were identiﬁed, which grouped into seven clus-
ters (A–G). Isolates from different sources during the same sampling
visit possessed a signiﬁcantly high similarity (N90%), such as N1-T5
and P1-E8 from the ﬁrst retail market and slaughterhouse sampling, re-
spectively, in cluster A and N2-J18 and P2-D3 from the second retail
market and slaughterhouse sampling in cluster B. Among the chosen
Salmonella Typhimurium isolates (Fig. 3), 10 PFGE patterns were char-
acterized, and they were grouped into three clusters (A–C). In line
with Salmonella Derby, Salmonella Typhimurium isolates from different
sources also had highly similar PFGE patterns, which can be represented
by N1-J2 and P1-E15 and by N2-T11 and P2-D8.

4. Discussion

A total of 31 Salmonella Derby and 19 Typhimurium isolates selected
randomly from the six visits of both sources were characterized using
PFGE. The PFGE patterns of all isolates differed by 1 to 3 bands from

investigated. MLST and PFGE were used to assess the clonal relationship
between isolates from the two sources, leading to the conclusion that
Salmonella in the retail markets originated from the slaughterhouse.

Salmonella spp. were recovered from a slaughterhouse and its
downstream retail markets in Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, with an
overall prevalence of 71.8% and 70.9%, respectively. For the slaughter-
house, the prevalence was signiﬁcantly higher than that reported in
Sichuan Province, China (10.7%) (Li et al., 2013), and in Germany
(13.2%) (Visscher et al., 2011), but it was lower than that reported in
Hong Kong (75%) (Chau et al., 1977). The prevalence in retail markets
was higher than that in some districts in China and other countries
(Hansen et al., 2010). However, several factors should be considered
when comparing the prevalence of Salmonella in different areas, includ-
ing sampling seasons, sample amounts, isolation methods, slaughter-
house management, and slaughtering procedure.

For serotyping, a total of 16 serovars were found among the 233 iso-
lates, including 14 from the slaughterhouse and nine from the retail
markets, which incorporated seven that were shared. The most com-
mon serotype in both sources was Salmonella Derby. To our knowledge,
Salmonella Derby was commonly isolated from pork and slaughter pigs,
and it was one of the most frequent serotypes that cause human salmo-
nellosis in many countries (EFSA, 2008a). In recent years, Salmonella

Derby has displayed increased prevalence in the world. For instance,
Salmonella Derby has surpassed Typhimurium as the predominant
serovar that is isolated from pig slaughterhouses (Bonardi et al., 2013)
and was the most common serotype isolated from infants and toddlers
in China (Cui et al., 2009). In addition, high isolation rates of Salmonella
Typhimurium and Uganda were also noticed from both sources.
Salmonella Typhimurium remains one of the most important serotypes
that can lead to severe human and animal diseases. For example,
4,[5],12:i:-, a variant of Typhimurium, has been an emerging cause
of infection around the world in recent years (Madajczak et al., 2014).
Salmonella Uganda has been continuously isolated in other countries
but was found sporadically in China (Kuo et al., 2014).

Though relevant departments have been emphasizing the limited
use of antibiotics in animal feeding, the effect was small. Antimicrobial
resistance in Salmonella is one of threats to human public health. Our re-
sults indicated that a similar proportion of slaughterhouse and retail
market isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic (65.2% and
70.5%, respectively). The highest rates of antimicrobial resistance were
against TET in both sources (49.7% and 37.2%); this was somewhat
expected because of its wide use in animal feed and was consistent
with reports from slaughterhouses in Italy (Piras et al., 2011) and retail
markets in Mexico (Miranda et al., 2009). Resistance to STR was also

The ﬁrst and second numbers correspond to different sampling times and sample numbers, respectively. For slaughterhouse strains, the second letter represents different stages,

frequently observed in isolates from both sources, which could be
explained by the accompany mechanism (Manie et al., 1998). Apart
from these, resistance to NAL in 34.6% of retail market isolates and
14.8% of slaughterhouse isolates deserves our attention because resis-
tance to this antimicrobial agent may lead to the delay or failure of ﬂu-
oroquinolone therapies (Van et al., 2007). MDR Salmonella isolates were
frequently observed among the slaughterhouse and retail market iso-
lates in this study, especially in Salmonella Typhimurium and Derby.
Of particular concern, one Salmonella Typhimurium slaughterhouse iso-
late and one Salmonella Typhimurium retail market isolate were resis-
tant to 10 antimicrobials, posing great risk to public health if these
MDR strains were transferred to humans via pork or pork-derived prod-
ucts (Li et al., 2014).

MLST results revealed that a total of 15 and 11 STs were identiﬁed in
slaughterhouse and retail market isolates. Among them, ST40 was the
most frequent genotype that was recovered in this study, and Fig. 1
shows that ST40 was present in each sampling visit of both sites. There-
fore, we speculated that strains of this ST persist in both sites and are
continually propagated (Piras et al., 2011). Moreover, ST40 has been
widely found in pigs and pork from Europe and the United States and
in humans from Asia and Europe (Li et al., 2014). To some extent, this
observation indicates that Salmonella can spread from swine to humans
via pork and pork-derived products (Hauser et al., 2011).

ST19 and ST34 have continually been reported to cause human sal-
monellosis in recent years (Garvey et al., 2013). And these two STs
were also in great diversity in the two sources, which should be treated
cautiously. Additionally, isolates that were characterized as ST19 and
ST34 belong to the same serotype, Salmonella Typhimurium, and the
same circumstance was also true for Salmonella Derby, which was rep-
resented by ST40 and ST71. These ﬁndings suggest that serovars and
STs were tightly coupled (Achtman et al., 2012).

Another case that should be considered is ST358, an emerging ST
in our study and a new ST that appeared in China that corresponds to
Salmonella Goldcoast, which caused an unusual increase of human
cases of Salmonella Goldcoast infection in Hungary in 2009 (Horvath
et al., 2013). Therefore, it is urgent for healthcare sectors to supervise
and prevent these cases.

PFGE, a valid and in-depth tool to investigate bacterial characteriza-
tions, has been frequently used to determine the genetic relationships
between Salmonella isolates (Angelo et al., 2015). PFGE typing allowed
more precise tracing of Salmonella Typhimurium and Derby isolates,
distinguishing 20 Salmonella Typhimurium and 16 Derby genotypes
from 390 and 285 isolates from two plants (Giovannacci et al., 2001).
In our study, the selected 31 Salmonella Derby isolates characterized
as ST40 or ST71, and 19 Salmonella Typhimurium typed as ST19 or
ST34 were subdivided into 30 and 10 pulsotypes, respectively, via
PFGE, which strengthened the discriminatory power and traceability
of Salmonella Derby and Typhimurium at the chromosome level.

Salmonella transmission from the slaughterhouse to retail markets
was frequently observed in almost all of the sampling visits except
visit 3. This transmission was represented by Salmonella isolates P1-C1
and N1-T5 in cluster A and P2-L2 and N2-J11 in cluster B during
visit 1 and 2, respectively, in the dendrogram of Salmonella Derby. Anal-
ogous circumstances also appeared in the dendrogram of Salmonella
Typhimurium, which were represented by N1-J2 and P1-E15 in cluster
B and N2-T11 and P2-D8 in cluster C. These isolates, whose PFGE
patterns were highly consistent (N90% similarity), demonstrated that
Salmonella clones spread along the pork production chain (Hauser
et al., 2011, 2012; Li et al., 2013). However, no isolates from visit 3
had PFGE ﬁngerprints that were similar to those from visit 1 and 2,
which could be explained by insufﬁcient samples and different outlets
from the slaughterhouse (Sandt et al., 2013).

Salmonella transmission along the slaughter line has also been wide-
ly discovered in slaughterhouses (Keelara et al., 2013). On the three
slaughterhouse samplings, prevalence rate of Salmonella of all the stages
was almost beyond 50%, especially in cooling water and evisceration
stages. Cooling water was easily contaminated by dirt, feces and ingesta
carried by the slaughtering pigs and it could be contamination sources
of subsequent stages, represented by Salmonella Derby P1-E8 and
P1-C1, P3-C3 and P3-D12. Salmonella transmission occurred in other
stages along the slaughter line, such as lymph node and carcass dress-
ing, submitting and evisceration, were also obvious from Salmonella
Derby P2-L2 and P2-D3 and Salmonella Typhimurium P2-E8 and
P2-S6, respectively. The direct or indirect correlation of these isolates

64

with ﬁnal retail pork-derived products deserves special attention. Also,
further studies are required to prove the conclusions as the sampling
intervals were somewhat too long to provide sufﬁcient data.

5. Conclusion

In summary, we examined the epidemiology of Salmonella in one
slaughterhouse and its downstream retail markets in Yangzhou, China.
Our results indicated a high prevalence of Salmonella in both sources.
Salmonella isolates from the two sources were demonstrated to be ge-
netically similar by MLST and PFGE, and Salmonella was transferred
along the slaughterhouse line and from the slaughterhouse to retail
markets. Furthermore, many serovars that were reported in humans
in other countries and MDR Salmonella were recovered in this study.
Therefore, it is imperative for healthcare departments in China to man-
age, supervise, and prevent these cases. Also, more legislation about
slaughtering procedures and prudent use of antimicrobials in animal
feeds should be enacted by the authorities to control the spread of
Salmonella from pigs to humans.
