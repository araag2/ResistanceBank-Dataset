The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  investigate  the  occurrence  of  multidrug-resistant,  extended
spectrum  beta-lactamase  (ESBL)  producing  Salmonella  spp.  isolated  from  conveyor  belts  of
broiler  cutting  rooms  in  Brazilian  broiler  processing  plants.  Ninety-eight  strains  of  Salmonella
spp.   were  analyzed.  Multidrug  resistance  was  determined  by  the  disk  diffusion  test  and
the  susceptibility  of  the  isolated  bacteria  was  evaluated  against  18  antimicrobials  from
seven   different  classes.  The  double  disk  diffusion  test  was  used  to  evaluate  ESBL  produc-
tion.  Of  the  98  strains  tested,  84  were  multidrug  resistant.  The  highest  rates  of  resistance
were   against  nalidixic  acid  (95%),  tetracycline  (91%),  and  the  beta-lactams:  ampicillin  and
cefachlor  (45%),  followed  by  streptomycin  and  gentamicin  with  19%  and  15%  of  strain  resis-
tance,  respectively.  By  contrast,  97%  of  the  strains  were  sensitive  to  chloramphenicol.  45%
of   the  strains  were  positive  for  the  presence  of  ESBL  activity.  In  this  study,  high  rates  of
multidrug  resistance  and  ESBL  production  were  observed  in  Salmonella  spp.

Introduction

Salmonella  spp.  is  one  of  the  main  agents  responsible  for  sev-
eral  infections,  e.g.,  food  borne  gastroenteritis.  Most  of  these
infections  cause  self-limiting  diarrhea  and  do  not  require
antimicrobial  treatment.  However,  in  certain  cases,  such  as
when  the  bacterium  is  spread  via  blood  stream  leading  to
complications  such  as  meningitis,  antibiotic  therapy  is  nec-
essary.  Such  complications  are  most  commonly  observed  in
children  and  elderly  and  immune  compromised  patients.  Flu-
oroquinolones  and  cephalosporins  are  the  drugs  of  ﬁrst-choice
in  such  cases.1

Food  of  animal  origin,  especially  poultry  derived  items,
are  the  main  sources  of  infection  by  Salmonella  spp.2 Given
the  importance  to  Salmonella  spp.  as  causative  agents  in  food
borne  diseases,  reduction  of  its  contamination  on  broiler  car-
casses  is  of  extremely  high  priority  for  industry  as  well  as
regulatory  agencies.3 The  occurrence  of  Salmonella  spp.  on  the
broiler  carcasses  might  be  a  result  of  contamination  either
at  the  farm  or  cross-contamination  within  the  processing
plant.4 Cross-contamination  can  be  attributed  partly  to  resid-
ual  bacteria  remaining  on  surfaces  and  equipment  after
sanitization.5

in  the 

Studies  on  Salmonella  spp.  are  usually  focused  on  ana-
lyzing  resistance  of  the  bacterium  to  antimicrobials  such
as  ﬂuoroquinolones;  but, 
last  decade  or  so,  bac-
terial  production  of 
large  spectrum  beta-lactamases  has
also  been  evaluated.6,7 In  Enterobacteriaceae,  resistance  to
cephalosporins  is  generally  attributed  to  the  production  of
large  spectrum  beta-lactamases  such  as  ESBL  (extended  spec-
trum  beta-lactamase)  and  AmpC  beta-lactamase.8 ESBL  is  the
term  used  for  any  beta-lactamase  that  is  acquired  and  not
intrinsic  to  a  species.  Such  lactamases  quickly  hydrolyze  and
confer  resistance  against  oxyimino-cephalosporins.  Mutant
beta-lactamases  that  have  similar  activity  are  also  referred  to
as  ESBLs.9,10

Extensive  studies  have  been  undertaken  to  analyze  ESBL
production  by  Klebsiella  spp.,  Enterobacter  spp.,  and  Escherichia
coli  isolated  from  human  clinical  samples.  These  studies
are  prompted  by  the  lack  of  therapeutic  success  against
these  microorganisms,  which  includes,  but  not  restricted  to,
cephalosporins.  Treatment  is  rendered  unsuccessful  by  the
acquisition  of  resistance  genes  that  reside  on  mobile  genetic
elements.  For  example,  plasmids  that  transmit  resistance
genes  for  cephalosporins  are  frequently  found  to  carry  resis-
tance  to  other  antibiotics,  such  as  ﬂuoroquinolones.11 Some
authors  have  also  reported  ESBLs  in  microorganisms  isolated
from  food  products.12–14 According  to  Blanc  et  al.  (2006),  these
ﬁndings  are  more   recent  in  the  case  of  E.  coli  and  Salmonella
spp.  as  compared  to  Klebsiella  spp.  and  Enterobacter  spp.  ESBL
production  by  Salmonella  spp.  isolated  from  animals  has  also
been  reported15,16;  although,  the  reports  on  ESBL  from  animal
origin  are  less  frequent.17,18

Due  to  the  public  health  risk  of  cross-contamination,  it
is  important  to  have  sufﬁcient  information  on  the  occur-
rence  of  pathogens,  e.g.,  Salmonella  spp.,  in  the  cutting  rooms
for  broiler  processing  and  slaughtering  facilities.  It  is  espe-
cially  important  to  have  knowledge  of  the  behavior  of  these
strains  against  antimicrobials.  Therefore,  the  objective  of

this  study  was  to  determine  the  occurrence  of  multidrug
isolated  from
resistant 
conveyor  belts  in  the  cutting  rooms  of  broiler  processing
plants.

Materials   and   methods

Isolation   and   identiﬁcation   of   Salmonella   spp.

Strains  of  Salmonella  spp.  were  obtained  from  the  cutting
rooms  of  four  different  Brazilian  broiler  processing  and  export-
ing  plants  having  a  slaughtering  capacity  in  excess  of  160,000
broilers/day.  For  the  isolation  of  Salmonella  spp.  from  the  sur-
face  of  the  conveyor  belts,  the  sponges  (Nasco  Whirl-PakTM),
pre-moistened  with  10  mL   of  0.1%  saline  peptone  water,  were
utilized  on  a  400  cm2 area.  Salmonella  spp.  detection  was  car-
ried  out  according  to  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA  –
USA)  methodology  as  published  in  the  Bacteriological  Analyt-
ical  Manual.19 Subsequent  to  these  tests,  isolates  of  Salmonella
spp.  were  conﬁrmed  by  genus  identiﬁcation  using  polymerase
chain  reaction  (PCR)  for  the  sifB  gene  as  per  the  protocol
described  by  Almeida  et  al.20

Results

Discussion

Out  of  the  98  strains  evaluated  (26,  23,  19,  and  30  from  each  of
the  four  cutting  rooms,  respectively),  three  were  sensitive  to  all
antimicrobials  tested,  four  were  resistant  to  one  class,  seven
were  resistant  to  two  classes,  and  84  (86%)  were  considered
multidrug  resistant.

Fig.  1  shows  the  resistance  proﬁles  of  the  multidrug  resis-
tant  strains  arranged  according  to  the  room  of  origin,  and
the  corresponding  percentage  proﬁles  in  each  room.  ESBL
activity  was  detected  in  45%  of  the  strains.  From  the  strains
positive  for  ESBL  production,  the  most  frequent  resistance  pro-
ﬁle  was  against  beta-lactams,  quinolones,  and  tetracyclines
(38/44);  the  ESBL-negative  strains  were  resistant  to  aminogly-
cosides,  quinolones,  and  tetracyclines  (36/54).  The  results  for
Salmonella  spp.  antimicrobial  susceptibility  test  are  presented
in  Fig.  2.

The  strains,  sensitive  to  all  antimicrobials  (3/98),  originated
from  Room  3  and  represented  16%  (3/19)  of  the  total  num-
ber  of  strains  isolated  from  this  room.  The  same  percentage
of  resistance  was  observed  for  only  one  or  two  antimicrobial
classes  and  52%  (10/19)  strains  were  multidrug  resistant.  How-
ever,  in  Rooms  1,  2,  and  4,  100%  (26/26),  87%  (20/23),  and  93%
(28/30),  respectively,  of  the  Salmonella  spp.  strains  were  mul-
tidrug  resistant.  The  highest  numbers  of  ESBL-positive  strain
were  isolated  from  Room  4,  corresponding  to  54%  (24/44)  of
the  positive  strains.

Recently,  incidence  of  antimicrobial  resistance  in  Salmonella
spp.  isolated  from  foods  of  animal  origin,  especially  poultry
products,  has  increased.27–29 In  this  study,  all  strains  were
sensitive  to  ciproﬂoxacin  and  95%  of  them  were  resistant  to
nalidixic  acid  (Fig.  2).  Hamidiam  et  al.30 suggested  that  the
low  in  vitro  resistance  to  ciproﬂoxacin  may  be  due  to  a  muta-
tion  in  the  gyrA  gene  and  that  in  vitro  resistance  to  nalidixic
acid  may  be  used  to  detect  the  actual  level  of  resistance  to
ciproﬂoxacin.  The  CLSI22 recommends  that  resistance  to  this
class  of  antimicrobials  should  be  considered  as  collective,  that
is,  resistance  to  one  drug  implies  that  the  microorganism  is
resistant  to  the  whole  class.  This  information  is  of  great  impor-
tance  because  ﬂuoroquinolones  are  considered  as  the  drug  of
ﬁrst  choice  for  the  treatment  of  infections  caused  by  Salmonella
spp.  in  human.31

isolated  from  the  poultry  production  chain 

High  levels  of  resistance  were  also  observed  against  tetra-
cycline  (Fig.  2).  Worldwide  incidence  of  resistance  in  Salmonella
spp. 
is  vari-
able  with  percentages  ranging  from  96.6%  to  21.8%.32–34 In
Brazil,  Oliveira  et  al.35 reported  low  resistance  indexes  in
Salmonella  Enteritidis 
isolated  from  humans,  poultry  car-
casses,  poultry-related  samples,  and  food  items  involved  in
food  borne  disease  outbreaks  in  the  southern  region  of  the
country.

Additionally,  97%  of  the  strains  tested  were  sensitive  to
chloramphenicol  (Fig.  2),  which  is  one  of  the  ﬁrst  drugs  used
in  veterinary  medicine  and  which  has  been  banned  from  ani-
mal   production  in  Brazil  since  1998.36 The  use  of  tetracycline
as  a  growth  promoter  in  poultry  production  is  also  prohibited
in  Brazil.37

All  strains  were  sensitive  to  the  carbapenems  tested;
this  is  an  important  ﬁnding  because  carbapenems  are  the
drugs  of  ﬁrst  choice  in  the  treatment  of  ESBL-producing
microorganisms.38 ESBL  production  was  detected 
in  45%
(44/98)  of  the  strains.  These  ESBL-positive  strains  were  also
multidrug  resistant.  Clemente  et  al.17 analyzed  1120  iso-
lates  of  Salmonella  spp.  from  food  items  of  animal  origin
and  found  only  ﬁve  ESBL-producing  strains.  However,  they
used  a  methodology  that  was  different  from  the  present  one.
Nogueira-Miranda  et  al.10 compared  six  methodologies  for  the
detection  of  ESBL  in  Enterobacter  spp.  and  concluded  that  the
double  disk  diffusion  test  showed  sensitivity  of  89.2%  and
speciﬁcity  of  100%  for  this  species.  Due  to  the  absence  of  a
standard  methodology  approved  by  any  of  the  international
committees  for  the  evaluation  of  Salmonella  spp.,  ESBL  produc-
tion  may  result  in  underestimation  of  the  occurrence  of  this
phenotype.  It  is  also  difﬁcult  to  compare  different  studies.  The
phenotypic  conﬁrmatory  tests  are  highly  sensitive  and  spe-
ciﬁc  as  compared  to  the  genotypic  conﬁrmatory  tests.39 This
study  was  aimed  to  screen  ESBL  producing  organisms.  Fur-
ther  research  is  required  for  the  genotypic  characterization
of  ESBL-producing  Salmonella  spp.  found  in  broiler  processing
plants.

In  conclusion,  the  present  study  demonstrated  multidrug
resistance  in  86%  and  ESBL  activity  in  45%  of  the  Salmonella
spp.  isolated  from  the  studied  broiler  processing  plants.  These
results  should  be  taken  as  a  precautionary  warning  for  the
