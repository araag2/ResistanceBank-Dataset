Abstract In Egypt, poultry production constitutes
one of the main sources of pollution with veterinary
antibiotics (VAs) into the environment. About 80 %
of meat production in Egypt is of poultry origin,
and the potential environmental risks associated
with the use of VAs in these farms have not yet
been properly evaluated. Thus, the main purpose of
this research was to evaluate the prevalence of
antibiotic-resistant enteric key bacteria and the in-
cidence of residual antibiotics in poultry farm en-
vironmental samples and to determine whether fer-
tilizing soils with poultry litter from farms poten-
tially brings ecological risks. From December 2011
to September 2012, a total of 225 litter, bird
dropping, and water samples were collected from
75 randomly selected boiler poultry farms. A high
prevalence of Escherichia coli (n=179; 79.5 %) in
contrast to the low prevalence of Salmonella spp.
(n=7; 3.1 %) was detected. Amongst E. coli iso-
lates, serotypes O142:K86, O125:K70, O91:K, and
O119:K69 were the most common. Meanwhile,
Salmonella enterica serotypes emek and enteritidis
were recovered. The antibiograms using the disc
diffusion method revealed significantly more com-
mon resistant and multi-resistant isolates in broiler
poultry farms. Residues of tetracycline and cipro-
−1
floxacin were detected at 2.125 and 1.401 mg kg
mean levels, respectively, in environmental samples
contaminated with E. coli-resistant strains by

HPLC. The risk evaluations highlighted that tetra-
cycline residues in poultry litter significantly dis-
play environmental risks with a hazard quotient
value above 1 (1.64). Our study implies that inef-
fective implementation of veterinary laws which
guide and guard against
incorrect VA usage may
potentially bring health and environmental risks.

Introduction

Poultry industry has steadily expanded in Egypt as
it has been encouraged by local governments to
ensure a stable supply of animal products and
farmers’ income. By 2006,
it was estimated that
84 % of the total meat production was of broiler
chicken origin (Maged and Hamdey 2006). Unfor-
tunately,
the expanding poultry production is in-
creasing not only the protein source for the local
demand but also the use of antimicrobials in these
regions. During the last decades, numerous veteri-
nary antibiotics (VAs) have been used globally as
growth promoters and therapeutic agents in live-
stock production because of their positive effects
(Arikan et al. 2007). VAs are used in poultry prac-
tice to prevent and control diseases and assist in
combating stress due to environmental changes and
in management practices (Pavlov et al. 2008). An-
timicrobial agents are among the commonly used
drugs in poultry production. In the USA, for exam-
ple,
the use of VAs as feeding supplements has

 2

increased by 109-fold from 1950 to 2004 (Arikan
et al. 2009), and 60 to 80 % were used for non-
therapeutic purposes (Mellon et al. 2001).

In Egypt, excessive and incorrect use of antimi-
crobials in veterinary medicine plays a key role in
the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, especially
enteric pathogens (Escherichia coli and Salmonella
species), that increasingly threatens the successful
treatment of infectious diseases (Anderson 2003).
On the other hand, many studies have shown that
antibiotics administered to livestock were usually
excreted without metabolism (Halling-Sørensen
et al. 1998). Residues of VAs can enter the envi-
ronment with the excreta of treated chickens when
poultry litter is spread on agricultural land to fer-
tilize it. Soil, thus, is the environmental compart-
ment primarily exposed (Spaepen et al. 1997). Con-
sequently,
the active ingredients reach the upper
soil
layer where they either may accumulate, be
rinsed off into surface waters, or leach to ground-
water where they can impact both human and en-
vironmental health (Boxall et al. 2003). Currently,
there is no legislation in the European Union for
limits of antibiotics in soils.

Recently, the safety of VAs in the environment
has become a matter of increasing public scrutiny
and legal requirements. Therefore, the residues of
the veterinary antibiotics in poultry farm environ-
mental samples were taken into account
in our
there have been many
research work. In Egypt,
studies on the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant
bacteria and antibiotic residues in food of poultry
origin including meat and table eggs (Okerman
et al. 2007; Mahmoud and Mohsen 2008); howev-
er, little is known about the prevalence and resi-
dues in environmental samples.

therefore,

The aims of the present cross-sectional study
to provide information on the
were,
prevalence and sources of key pathogens in farms,
to provide data for risk assessment, and to deter-
mine the sensitivity of isolates to commonly used
antimicrobial agents in the poultry industry in
Egypt. Moreover, a questionnaire was structured
to reflect
the rate of awareness to VAs health
hazards used in poultry farming. Finally, the resi-
dues and potential risks of VAs were evaluated to
understand whether the poultry litter poses risks to
the environment when they were introduced into
fields by agricultural practices.

Materials and methods

Sample collection

The study was carried out in Sharkia Governorate which
has one of the major sources of animal protein, the
poultry sector, in Egypt. Out of 13 agricultural poultry
sector zones in Sharkia district, four (Zagazig, Bilbeis,
Minya Al Qamh, and Mashtool) were selected by simple
random sampling method. Multi-stage random sam-
pling technique was used to select farms per zone. The
research was carried out in two stages: questionnaire
administration and cross-sectional study.

The survey

Structured questionnaires were administered to 75 poul-
try farmers that represent the four investigated districts.
The questionnaires were designed to assess the level of
awareness of legislation guiding and guarding the use of
veterinary antimicrobials with particular reference to
tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. The questionnaires, for
example, include pattern and frequency distribution of
VAs usage in poultry farms, nature of drug preparations,
staff administrating drugs, mode of administration, etc.

The cross-sectional study

A total of 225 litter, bird dropping, and water
samples were collected from 75 broiler poultry
farms during the period between December 2011
and September 2012. From each farm, pooled sam-
ples of litter, bird dropping, and water were taken.
The litter sample was collected in a zigzag manner
from different areas of the farm floor, then pooled
to form one uniform sample, and packed separately
in sterile plastic bags. Meanwhile, water samples
were collected in 150-ml sterile glass bottles from
drinkers in front of birds. Near the end of the
rearing period, bird dropping samples were freshly
collected from the litter surface and placed on ster-
ile buffered peptone water. After the samples were
mixed properly, they were lyophilized and sieved
through a 2 mm sieve before further handling.
Samples were immediately transported under
cooled conditions to the laboratory and stored in
the dark at 4 °C prior to analysis.

Bacterial isolation

Salmonella was isolated according to a standard method
described in ISO 6579 (2002), and an appropriate meth-
od was used to isolate E. coli. Twenty-five grams from
each sample was homogenized well with 225 ml buff-
ered peptone water and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C for
pre-enrichment. For isolation of Salmonella, 0.1 ml
from each pre-enriched broth was transferred to tubes
containing 10 ml Rappaport–Vassiliadis selective en-
richment broth (Oxoid CM699) and incubated at
41 °C for 24 h. The broth cultures were then streaked
on xylose lysine desoxycholate (XLD) agar (Oxoid
CM469) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Typical
colonies were chosen for confirmatory biochemical tests
and serotyped using the Kauffmann–White typing
scheme by slide agglutination with standard antisera
(Murex Biotech Ltd., Dartford, England, and Dade-
Behring Gmbh, Marburg, Germany).

For E. coli isolation, 1 ml of pre-enrichment broth
was transferred to 10 ml MacConkey broth (Oxoid
CM5a) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h for enrichment.
Then, a loopful was streaked on Eosine methylene blue
(EMB) agar (Oxoid CM69) and incubated at 37 °C for
24 h. Typical E. coli colonies were confirmed with a
biochemical identification test. All isolates identified as
E. coli species were serotyped. Serotyping was carried
out by a national reference laboratory (Animal Health
Research Institute, Doki, Giza, Egypt) using published
methods.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

All recovered isolates of Salmonella enterica and E. coli
were tested for their antimicrobial susceptibility using
the disc diffusion method on Mueller–Hinton agar
(Oxoid 337) according to the standard procedure of the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI
2006). The antibiotics used in this study were ampicillin
(10 mg), amoxicillin (25 mg), enrofloxacin (10 mg),
gentamicin (10 mg), erythromycin (15 mg), ciprofloxa-
cin (5 mg), neomycin (30 mg), trimethoprim–sulfameth-
oxazole (1.25/23.75 mg), chloramphenicol (30 mg), and
tetracycline (30 mg). All antibiotic discs were provided
by bioMerieux, F6980 Marcy l’Etoile, France. After
incubating the inoculated plate aerobically at 37°C for
18–24 h in an aerobic atmosphere, the susceptibility of
the isolates to each antimicrobial agent was measured
and the results were interpreted in accordance with

Page 3 of 10  2 

interpretive criteria provided by CLSI (2006). E. coli
ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923,
and E. coli ATCC 35218 were used as quality control
strains.

Screening of antibiotic residues

The determination of antibiotic residues was done in a
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) appa-
ratus (a constant liquid chromatography pump, an
autosampler, a wavelength UV detector set,
ChemStation software; Agilent Thermo Scientific Co.,
USA) to analyze tetracycline and ciprofloxacin residues
in samples that harbored E. coli phenotypically resistant
to tetracycline and/or ciprofloxacin.

Sample extraction

For determination of tetracycline residues, frozen sam-
ples were thawed; then, 2 g of each sample was cut into
very small pieces, ground into fine particles using a
Sartorius mincer, and consequently homogenized in a
blender for 2 min, and 0.1 ml citric acid was added. To
this mixture, 1 ml nitric acid (30 %), 4 ml methanol
(HPLC grade), and 1 ml deionized water were added,
respectively. The suspension with solid particles was
placed in a vortex, kept in an ultrasonic bath for
15 min, and centrifuged for 10 min at 5300 rpm. After
filtration through a 0.45-μm nylon filter, 20 μl of solu-
tion was injected into HPLC for analysis according to
Senyuva et al. (2000).

For the detection of ciprofloxacin residues, 2 g of
each thawed frozen sample was cut into very small
pieces and ground into fine powder using the Sartorius
mincer. After that, it was homogenized in a blender for
2 min and then 8 ml citric acid was added. The suspen-
sion with solid particles was placed in a vortex for
ground mixing for 1 min, then rotary agitated for
10 min, and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm. After
filtration through a 0.45-μm nylon filter, 25 μl of solu-
tion was injected into HPLC for analysis according to
Gigososa et al. (2000).

Chromatographic condition and calibration curve

The separation was done on a Hypersil GOLD C18
(10 μm, 100×4.6 mm) column with mobile phase com-
posed of methanol (HPLC grade) and formic acid 0.1 %
−1
using a gradient method with a flow rate of 1.5 ml min

−1 at 25 °C for tetracycline and
at 25 °C and 0.3 ml min
ciprofloxacin, respectively. Detection was performed
with a UV detector set at 350 and 294 nm wavelengths
for tetracycline and ciprofloxacin, respectively. Quanti-
fication of residues in samples was obtained and calcu-
lated from areas under curves extrapolated automatical-
ly by the software (ChemStation). The detection param-
eters for antibiotic residues are summarized in Table 1.
The concentration of antibiotic residue in the samples
was calculated with reference to calibration curves that
were prepared from work solutions of tetracycline and
ciprofloxacin using concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 2.5,
−1 in methanol eluent. For the preparation
5, and 10 mg l
of the work solutions, tetracycline hydrochloride (Sig-
ma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis, USA) and ciprofloxacin
(Bayer Pharmaceuticals, West Haven, CT, USA) stock
−1) were diluted to various concentra-
solutions (1 μg l
tions as previously mentioned. The detection limit for
both was 0.01 ppm, while the retention time was 3.7 and
7.15 min for tetracycline and ciprofloxacin, respectively.

Method validation

Although the liquid chromatography (LC–MS–MS)
method was found to be more sensitive than HPLC with
the UV detector method, we used the latter for the
detection of VAs based on the following two consider-
ations: firstly, this study aimed to investigate the VA
residues in poultry litter from poultry plant operations in
which most residues may be high enough to be detected
by HPLC; secondly, the expected detection limitation in
−1 which is the critical concen-
this study is 100 μg kg
tration for further risk assessment, and it could be real-
ized by HPLC. Furthermore, in essence where plasma
concentrations are high and rapid turnaround of data is
not required, the use of the LC–UV is more than
adequate.

Quality assurance measures including blanks; litter,
water, and dropping-spiked recovery; and experimental
repeatability and reproducibility were conducted to en-
sure the accuracy and precision of this method. Blanks
were employed to quantify the concentrations of antibi-
otics in solution. Calibration curves were established
−1.
with six points along the range of 0.01–10 mg kg
The correlation coefficients of the objectives were all
above 0.999.

Spiked samples were analyzed in four replicates. The
recovery of individual antibiotics was calculated by
dividing the detected concentration by the spiked

concentrations in the samples. The average recovery
was 89, 99, and 93 % for tetracycline and 85, 98, and
90 % for ciprofloxacin in litter, water, and bird dropping,
respectively. RSDs and intra-days and inter-days for
tetracycline and ciprofloxacin were 3 and 3.6 % and
4.2 and 3.9 %, respectively.

Hazard risk assessment

The ecological risk of VAs in broiler chicken litter to soil
microorganisms was assessed by the value of a hazard
quotient (HQ) (Eq. 1) (Park and Choi 2008). The pre-
dicted environmental concentrations (PECs) of antibi-
otics in soil (milligrams per kilogram) were calculated
according to the method by Spaepen et al. (1997)
(Eq. 2). The predicted no-effect concentrations
(PNECs) of antibiotics in soil (milligrams per kilogram
or milligrams per liter) were calculated using Eq. (3). If
the value of the hazard quotient is below 1 unit, no
ecological risks are expected; otherwise, potential eco-
logical risks may be observed.

where M is the amount of broiler chicken litter applied in
farmland annually (kilograms per hectare) which is in-
directly calculated by determining the limit rates for
nitrogen (MN, kilograms excreta per hectare per
year—nitrogen): MN=AN/PN×PE

where AN, kilograms N per hectare per year=170;
PN, kilograms N per place per year=0.21; and PE, the
yearly manure output=37.2 kg place year (Spaepen
et al. 1997).

C is the current concentration of veterinary antibi-
otics in broiler litter (milligrams per kilogram) and D is
the mass of the top 0–20 cm of soil in farmland (kilo-
grams per hectare). For this study, a soil depth of 5 cm
−3 was used. As in the
with a density of 2.65 kg m
procedure presented by Spaepen et al. (1997), the
weight of this soil (W, kilograms per hectare) is calcu-
lated using the soil volume (V, cubic meters per hectare)
and bulk density (ρ, kilograms per cubic meter). The
volume of the top 5 cm is calculated by converting
centimeter into meter and hectare into square meter, that

is, V=500. The weight of the soil is then described by
the relation: Ws=V×ρ (Kelly et al. 2003).

TOX (milligrams per kilogram or milligrams per
liter) is the toxicity of antibiotics to soil microorganisms.
It can be substituted with the lowest median effective
concentration (EC50) or pollution-induced community
tolerance. The values of median effective concentration
were adopted according to studies by Thiele-Bruhn and
Beck (2005). AFs are the assessment factors. The value
is 1000 if the risk assessment is conducted by an acute
toxicity test or 100 if based on a chronic toxicity test
(EMEA 2006).

Since median effective concentrations are currently
only available for six of the antibiotics, between which
ciprofloxacin is not located, the potential risks of only
tetracycline antibiotic were estimated. Since the risks
were estimated by acute toxicity tests, assessment fac-
tors of 1000 were used here.

Results and discussion

Bacteriological examination

Of the 225 broiler chicken farm samples, 179 (79.5 %)
samples for each of litter (66/75), drinking water (46/
75), and bird dropping (67/75) were positive for E. coli
as shown in Table 2. The most common isolated E. coli
serotype was O142:K86 (20.1 %), followed by
O125:K70 (13.95), O91:K and untypable (12.8 %),

and O119:K69 (7.8 %). Meanwhile, S. enterica species
was isolated in 7 (3.1 %) of 225 samples; 3 and 4
isolates were recovered from litter and bird dropping
samples, respectively. No Salmonella was detected from
water of investigated poultry farms (n=75) (Table 2).
S. enterica serotypes emek and enteritidis were recov-
ered in a percentage of 85.7 and 14.3 %, respectively.
The results demonstrated that poultry farms in Egypt
were heavily contaminated with enteric bacteria partic-
ularly pathogenic and non-pathogenic E. coli serotypes.
The detection frequency of E. coli was higher than other
prevailing studies in Egypt (Draz et al. 1996). This was
not a surprise since the organism is part of the normal
flora of the intestinal tracts of poultry; however, the
recovery of E. coli in high prevalence from farm drink-
ing water indicates unhygienic conditions.

Although Salmonella spp. prevalence from poultry
farms was low, the detected serovars pose a significant
public health threat because they are indicative that
broiler poultry farms in Egypt harbor zoonotic organ-
isms that have the potential of entering the food chain.
Herikstad et al. (2002) considered S. enterica serovar
enteritidis is the most common species of Salmonella
isolated from humans worldwide. Furthermore,
Hang’ombe et al. (1999) isolated S. enteritidis from
chicken carcasses processed for human consumption
and indicated that S. enterica serovar enteritidis are
potential sources of infection to humans. Moreover, S.
emek was one of the most common Salmonella sero-
types in the poultry environment (Vo et al. 2006).

Hence, it is imperative that disease control strategies
should not only focus on reducing the occurrence of
bacterial infections in poultry but should also include the
need to reduce the threat of zoonotic pathogens infecting
humans.

Susceptibility testing

Prevalence of resistance of E. coli (n=179) and Salmo-
nella spp. (n=7) isolated from broiler poultry farm
samples for the ten VAs tested indicated that E. coli
serogroups had the highest resistance to ampicillin
(97.2 %), followed by amoxicillin (94.9 %), erythromy-
cin (89.4 %), sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim (86.6 %),
tetracycline and neomycin (78.2 %), and chloramphen-
icol (72.6 %), but resistance to gentamicin and
enrofloxacin (61.4 %), and ciprofloxacin (59.7 %) was
the lowest (Table 3). Salmonella isolate resistance pat-
terns to all tested antimicrobials had the nearly similar
levels of resistance compared to those of E. coli
serogroups as serovars exhibited the highest resistance
to ampicillin, followed by amoxicillin, tetracycline, and
sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim. However, the lowest
resistance was recorded against ciprofloxacin and
enrofloxacin (Table 3).

Unfortunately, it is obvious that almost all E. coli and
S. enterica isolates were resistant to more than three
classes of antibiotics (multi-drug resistant), which may
be attributed to the misuse of these antibiotics in veter-
inary treatment in Egypt. Besides, E. coli and Salmonel-
la isolates were nearly similar in resistance, and this may
be due to the potential transmission of resistant genes in
between via plasmid trans-conjugation (Dahshan et al.
2010). The emergence and spread of antimicrobial re-
sistance in bacteria of medical importance impose seri-
ous constraints on the options available for treatment of
many infections, and this raises a concern among gen-
eral practitioners and pediatricians in developing
countries.

Questionnaire response

Based on the questionnaire survey of the farmers during
the study, all farms were of deep litter management
system and large scale (above 2000 bird capacity), and
use commercial feeds. Regarding the pattern and fre-
quency distribution of drug usage, farmers used various
antimicrobial groups as all the investigated farms
(100 %) use different groups of antibiotics in the same
rearing cycle in the form of veterinary and human

preparations, staff administration of drugs were done by
untrained personnel, lack of awareness of legislation
guiding the use and marketing of veterinary drugs, and
non-observance of withdrawal periods. This question-
naire depicts the true state of misuse of veterinary drugs
amongst unqualified competitors in the poultry indus-
tries in Egypt, which eventually leads to high chances of
antibiotic resistance and residue occurrences on many
farms. These findings concurred with a previous report
that stated chances of residue occurrence are higher
when drugs are wrongly administered outside the rec-
ommendation of experts (Van Dresser and Wilcke
1989). Therefore, antibiotic residues were assessed to
provide some preliminary information on the occur-
rence of VA residues in broiler poultry farms in Egypt
as there is scanty number of studies related to VA
residues in poultry farm environmental samples.

Veterinary antibiotic residues in poultry litter

From ten VAs that revealed resistance, only two (tetra-
cycline and ciprofloxacin) were assessed for residues.
As tetracycline is one of the most widely used antimi-
crobial drug groups in poultry farming, all the farms
(100 %) screened use tetracycline as it is used as both
antimicrobial and anticoccidial agent. Moreover, tetra-
cycline commercial preparations are utilized extensively
in egg production because it is believed to enhance egg
production and give brown coloration to eggshells.
Concerning ciprofloxacin, the quinolones group are po-
tent inhibitors of DNA gyrase enzyme, which is critical
for DNA replication and transcription (Suto et al. 1992).
The toxicity and side effects of quinolones are well
established in animals and humans (Khadra et al. 2012).
In this study, the mean levels of tetracycline and
ciprofloxacin antibiotic residue were found to be 2.125
−1 in positive samples [contaminated
and 1.401 mg/kg
with E. coli phenotypically resistant to tetracycline (n=
140) and ciprofloxacin (n=107)], respectively (Table 4).
However, no residues for tetracycline were detected in
drinking water (n=40). Consequently, we cannot affirm
that the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a
farm sample means the existence of residues in the same
positive sample. The possible reasons for high antibiotic
residues in broiler poultry farms in the study area may
be attributed to lack of veterinary drug control, avail-
ability of numerous trade names, and forms to the same
antibiotic active principles (tetracycline, ciprofloxacin)
in Egyptian markets, and also poverty plays a key role in

the latter case because most farmers cannot afford the
services of a veterinarian and so resort to treating the
birds themselves.

Potential risk assessment

There are several limitations to the HQ approach as HQs
are combined for substances with Subchronic Reference
Doses (RfDs) based on critical effects of varying toxi-
cological significance. Also, it will often be the case that
RfDs of varying levels of confidence that include dif-
ferent uncertainty adjustments and modifying factors
will be combined (e.g., extrapolation from animals to
humans, from one exposure duration to another). More-
over, the application of the HQ equation to a number of
compounds that are not expected to induce the same
type of effects or that do not act by the same mechanism
could overestimate the potential for effects. This possi-
bility is generally not of concern if only one or two
substances are responsible for driving the HQ above
unity as in our study risk assessment. Although the
HQ approach has limitations, it is still one of the base-
line health risk assessment processes.

According to a recommendation in the European
Union (Directive 92/18/EEC 1992), a risk assessment
of applying broiler chicken litter on farmlands is neces-
sary if the concentration of veterinary antibiotics in
−1; therefore, the study
broiler litter is over 100 μg kg
area was evaluated for the environmental risk of residual
−1) in broiler chick-
VAs (tetracycline, conc. 2394 μg kg
en litter. As shown in Table 5, the results of predicted
environmental concentrations, predicted no-effect con-
centrations, and hazard quotients for tetracycline resi-
dues in poultry litter significantly display environmental
risks as it is estimated to have a hazard quotient value
above 1 (1.64). Based on this study, tetracycline might
be one of the dangerous VAs for soil microorganisms in
Egypt. The risks of tetracyclines from poultry litter in

this region should be paid special attention. On the other
hand, various types of VAs and other coexisting pollut-
ants in soils may alter the toxicity of a single pollutant.
Therefore, further research is strongly recommended to
simulate the behaviors of poultry litter veterinary anti-
biotics in an actual environmental system.

Conclusions

This study identified litter, water, and bird dropping as
sources of potentially clinically significant pathogens.
As there are currently no validated technologies to elim-
inate Salmonella or E. coli in poultry farms (Horchner
et al. 2006), good farming practice should focus on
reducing the risk of the dissemination of these pathogens
in the farming environment. Besides, it is also very
obvious that poultry farmers (without consulting a vet-
erinarian) in the study area do not adhere to withdrawal
periods of antimicrobial drugs; most times, farmers do
not even bother reading the manufacturer’s instructions
before the use of a drug. Therefore, strict regulations
must be implemented to control the usage of antibiotics
in order to stop the emergence of resistant strains. Public
education and awareness of the risk of misuse of antimi-
crobial drugs are crucial. Residues, resistance patterns,
and potential risk assessment indicated that VAs pose a
potential for transmission of resistance through the food
chain and environmental risks on local farmland.
