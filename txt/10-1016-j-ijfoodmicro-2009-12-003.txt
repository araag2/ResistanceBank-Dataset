The presence of broad-spectrum-cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli isolates and the implicated mechanisms of
resistance were investigated in 79 food samples of animal origin obtained in different supermarkets and local
butcheries in Tunisia. Ten of these samples (12.6%) harbored extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing
E. coli isolates and 13 ESBL-positive isolates were recovered (one or two/sample), which exhibited nine different
Pulsed-Field-Gel-Electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. ESBLs detected were the following: CTX-M-1 (10 strains), CTX-
M-1+TEM-1b (2 strains) and CTX-M-1+TEM-20 (1 strain). The orf477 sequence was identiﬁed downstream of
blaCTX-M-1 gene in all 13 strains and ISEcp1 upstream in 9 strains. All ESBL-positive strains were included into
phylogenetic group A or B1 (4 and 9 strains, respectively). Three of the 79 food samples (3.8%) contained broad-
spectrum-cephalosporin-resistant and ESBL-negative E. coli isolates with AmpC phenotype. One isolate per sample
was studied, and they showed unrelated PFGE patterns. The CMY-2 type beta-lactamase was identiﬁed in one of
these 3 strains and speciﬁc point mutations in the promoter/attenuator region of ampC gene (at positions −42,
−18, −1 and +58) were detected in the remaining two strains. Twelve ESBL-positive and one ESBL-negative E. coli
strains contained class 1 integrons with the following gene cassette arrangements: dfrA1+aadA (6 strains) and
dfrA17+aadA5 (7 strains). E. coli strains from food samples could represent a reservoir of ESBL-encoding genes
and integrons that could be transmitted to humans through the food chain.

1. Introduction

Escherichia coli is a normal inhabitant of the intestinal tract of most
animals and humans (Tannock 1995), and it can easily contaminate food
products during animal evisceration at slaughter or during food
manipulation. This microorganism can also be implicated in human
infections and broad-spectrum cephalosporins are important agents
used for the treatment of serious human E. coli infections. Previous
studies have reported that E. coli isolates from animals and from food
products can harbor resistance determinants to many classes of
antimicrobial agents, constituting an important reservoir for transmis-
sible resistance genes (Sáenz et al., 2004a; Smet et al., 2008). The
inclusion of different antimicrobial resistance genes on mobile elements
such as plasmids, transposons, and integrons facilitates the rapid
dissemination of these genes among bacteria. E. coli strains are highly
capable of acquiring and transferring antimicrobial resistance genes to
other microorganisms (Sunde and Norström 2006).

In the past few years, there has been an important concern in the
scientiﬁc community about the emergence and dissemination of E. coli
isolates producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) in human
medicine, especially of the CTX-M class, very frequently associated to
community infections (Pitout et al., 2005; Livermore et al., 2007). ESBLs
hydrolyze broad-spectrum cephalosporins and aztreonam, but not
cephamicins (as cefoxitin), and these enzymes are inhibited by
clavulanic acid. CTX-M-class beta-lactamases hydrolyze cefotaxime
very efﬁciently, and six different groups of enzymes have been
described, being those of the CTX-M-1 and CTX-M-9 groups the most
prevalent ones in human infections (Livermore et al., 2007). In the last
few years, different reports have alerted about the dissemination of
ESBL-positive E. coli isolates among the intestinal microbiota of healthy
humans (Vinué et al., 2009), as well as of food-producing animals and
also in food products (Briñas et al., 2003, 2005; Blanc et al., 2006; Girlich
et al., 2007; Jouini et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2007; Smet et al., 2008; Escudero
et al., 2009). These resistant bacteria could enter the food chain,
representing a problem for food safety because they can transfer
resistance genes to pathogenic bacteria.

Plasmidic class C beta-lactamases constitute an important mech-
anism of resistance that inactivates broad-spectrum cephalosporins as

well as cephamycins (cefoxitin), and these enzymes are not inhibited
by clavulanic acid. Among them, those of the CMY class are acquiring
great relevance in the last years, due to the problems they cause for
therapy in E. coli infections (Haldorsen et al., 2008). Few data do exist
in the literature about the dissemination of this type of enzymes
among E. coli isolates of food origin.

It is known that all E. coli isolates harbor a chromosomal ampC
beta-lactamase gene, and due to its low natural expression level, it is
not associated to beta-lactam resistance. Nevertheless, speciﬁc
nucleotidic point mutations in the promoter/attenuator region of
this gene (speciﬁcally at the −42 or −32 positions) with respect to
the one of E. coli K12 are associated with the hyperproduction of the
chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase (Caroff et al., 2000; Haldorsen
et al., 2008). Hyperproduction of this AmpC beta-lactamase is
associated with resistance to some beta-lactam antimicrobials as
ampicillin, amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, and cefoxitin, and also confer
low level resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins. The preva-
lence of this mechanism of resistance among food E. coli isolates has
been scarcely analyzed (Briñas et al., 2002).

In a previous study carried out by our group (Jouini et al., 2007),
the prevalence of ESBL-containing E. coli isolates was analyzed in a
small number of food samples of animal origin obtained in 2006, but
the presence of plasmidic class C beta-lactamases or the hyperpro-
duction of chromosomal ampC beta-lactamase were not tested. The
aim of the present study was to characterize the mechanisms of
broad-spectrum cephalosporin resistance in E. coli isolates recovered
from food samples of animal origin in Tunisia during 2007, and to
characterize the type of ESBL genes implicated in resistance, their
genetic environments and the associated antimicrobial resistance
genes and integrons. It was also our interest to determine if the ESBL-
producing E. coli isolates detected in this study harbored the shiga-
toxin genes or belonged to the O157 serotype, due to the importance
of these characteristics in food safety. The present study will provides
more information about the real problem of ESBL and of other
mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance in food E. coli isolates, and will
represent a valuable help to control this emerging problem and to
track its future evolution.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Samples and E. coli isolation

Seventy-nine food samples of animal origin (26 of poultry, 28 of
sheep, 14 of beef, 10 of ﬁsh, and 1 of horse) were obtained between
February and November 2007. They were recovered in 41 butcheries,
7 local markets and one sheep farm from 12 different cities all around
Tunisia. Refrigerated samples were transported to the laboratory, and
all of them were tested within 24 h of collection. A 30 g portion of
each sample was vigorously homogenized with 270 ml of buffered
peptone water and incubated for 6 h at 42 °C; 100 µl of the suspension
was streaked onto MacConkey agar plates (Oxoid, LTD, England)
supplemented with cefotaxime (2 µg/ml), and incubated for 24 h at
37 °C. Two suspected E. coli colonies from each sample (on the basis of
colony size and morphology) were selected for identiﬁcation by
biochemical tests, and also by a speciﬁc PCR ampliﬁcation of uidA gene
(Jouini et al., 2007).

2.2. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Susceptibility testing to 15 antimicrobial agents was carried out in
E. coli isolates by the disk diffusion method according to the CLSI
criteria (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2008). The
antimicrobial agents tested were the following ones (concentration
of the disks used, expressed in µg): ampicillin (10), cefoxitin (30),
ceftazidime (30), cefotaxime (30), aztreonam (30), gentamicin (10),
amikacin (30), tobramycin (10), streptomycin (10), nalidixic acid (30),

ciproﬂoxacin (5), sulfonamides (200), trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole
(SXT, 1.25+23.75), tetracycline (30), and chloramphenicol (30). E. coli
ATCC 25922 was used as a control strain. Isolates showing a phenotype
of resistance (or reduced susceptibility) to broad-spectrum-cephalos-
porins were further characterized. Isolates were tested for ESBL
production by the double-disk test with cefotaxime, ceftazidime and
aztreonam in the presence or absence of clavulanic acid (Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute, 2008).

2.3. Pulsed-Field-Gel-Electrophoresis (PFGE)

The clonal relationship among E. coli isolates was determined by
PFGE using XbaI enzyme as previously described (Sáenz et al., 2004a).
XbaI macrorestriction patterns were visually analyzed and interpreted
according to previously reported criteria (Tenover et al., 1995).

2.4. Phylogenetic classiﬁcation of E. coli strains

The isolates were assigned to the phylogenetic groups A, B1, B2 or
D using a PCR strategy with speciﬁc primers for chuA, yjaA and TspE4.
C2 genes as previously recommended (Clermont et al., 2000).

2.5. Characterization of β-lactamase genes and genetic environment of
blaCTX-M genes

Genes encoding TEM, SHV, OXA, CTX-M, and CMY enzymes, and
the genetic environment of blaCTX-M genes were analyzed by PCR and
sequencing of both strands (Vinué et al., 2009). Nucleotide segments
and their deduced amino acid sequences were compared with those
included in the GenBank database as well as with those deposited at
the website http://www.lahey.org/Studies in order to conﬁrm the
speciﬁc type of beta-lactamase gene. The mutation in the promoter/
attenuator region of the chromosomal ampC gene, associated with its
overexpression, was also analyzed by PCR ampliﬁcation, sequencing
and comparison to the same region of the E. coli K12 (Briñas et al.,
2005). Positive and negative controls from the bacterial collection of
the University of La Rioja were included in all PCR assays.

2.6. Detection of virulence genes and genes conferring resistance to
non-beta-lactam antimicrobial agents

The presence of genes encoding shiga toxin 1 and 2 (stx1–stx2)
was studied by a speciﬁc PCR assay (Bastian et al., 1998). In addition, it
was determined if our E. coli isolates corresponded to the serotype
O157 using an allele-speciﬁc PCR ampliﬁcation of the 5′ region of the
rfb locus (Clermont et al., 2007).

The presence of genes associated with tetracycline- [tet(A) and tet(B)],
streptomycin- [aadA1 and aadA2], sulfamethoxazole- [sul1, sul2, and
sul3], and gentamicin-resistance [aac(3)-I, aac(3)-II, and aac(3)-IV] was
determined by PCR (Sáenz et al., 2004a), including in all cases positive and
negative controls from the collection of the University of La Rioja. The
detection of dfr genes,
implicated in trimethoprim resistance, was
performed by PCR–RFLP analysis (Sáenz et al., 2004a).

2.7. Detection and characterization of integrons

The presence of intI1 and intI2 genes (encoding class 1 and class 2
integrases, respectively) was examined by PCR in all sulfonamide-
resistant isolates with unrelated PFGE patterns and also with indistin-
guishable PFGE patterns but different antimicrobial resistance proﬁles.
The variable regions of class 1 and class 2 integrons were characterized
by PCR and sequencing in all intI1- or intI2-positive isolates, respectively,
and sequences were compared with those included in GenBank to
identify gene cassettes. The presence of qacEΔ1-sul1genes in the 3′-
conserved region of class 1 integrons was also investigated in all intI1-
positive isolates (Sáenz et al., 2004a).

3. Results and discussion

3.1. E. coli recovery from food samples

E. coli

isolates with a phenotype of resistance or reduced
susceptibility to broad-spectrum-cephalosporins (speciﬁcally cefo-
taxime) were recovered in 13 of the 79 food samples analyzed
(16.4%), and 20 isolates were further characterized. Seventeen of the
20 cefotaxime-resistant isolates (obtained from 10 of the 13 positive
food samples) exhibited a positive ESBL-screening test (Table 1). The
remaining 3 cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates (obtained from 3 of
the 13 positive food samples) showed an AmpC phenotype charac-
terized by resistance to cefoxitin and amoxicillin–clavulanic acid in
addition to reduced susceptibility to broad-spectrum cephalosporins
and a negative ESBL-screening test (Table 1). As a consequence, the
prevalence of ESBL-positive E. coli isolates in food samples in this
study was 12.6%, and the prevalence of ESBL-negative E. coli isolates
with an AmpC phenotype was of 3.8%.

not due to the dissemination of a clonal strain but to the emergence of
this mechanisms of resistance in clonally-unrelated strains. It is known
that ESBL-encoding genes are included in transferable plasmids and this
could explain the high clonal diversity found in this study.

All our 20 cefotaxime-resistant isolates of food origin (ESBL-
producers and AmpC phenotype) belonged to the phylogenetic groups
A (31% of strains) or B1 (69% of strains) and no strain was identiﬁed in
the phylogroups B2 or D (Tables 2 and 3). It has been previously
indicated that commensal E. coli, as is the case of our strains, are more
frequently ascribed to phylogroups A and B1 (Johnson et al., 2005).

The presence of speciﬁc genes encoding shiga toxins 1 and 2 as
well as the serotype O157 was checked by speciﬁc PCRs using positive
and negative control strains. All 16 cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates
showed a negative result in both PCR assays indicating that those
isolates did not belong to this virulence serotype and also did not
harbor the shiga toxin genes.

3.3. Mechanisms of resistance in ESBL-positive E. coli strains

3.2. Clonal relationships among cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates and
detection of virulence determinants

The clonal relationship among the 20 cefotaxime-resistant E. coli
isolates was established based on PFGE of XbaI-digested genomic DNA.
One E. coli strain per sample was maintained for further studies or two
strains of the same sample if they presented different PFGE patterns. As a
consequence, 13 ESBL-positive and 3 ESBL-negative/AmpC-phenotype-
positive E. coli isolates with 12 different PFGE patterns were included in
the study and further characterized (Table 1).

It is remarkable the high clonal diversity of the ESBL-positive E. coli
isolates detected in this study indicating that this type of resistance is

The presence of genes encoding beta-lactamases was studied in
the 13 ESBL-positive E. coli strains by PCR and sequencing and the
following beta-lactamases were identiﬁed: CTX-M-1 (10 strains),
CTX-M-1+TEM-1b (2 strains) and CTX-M-1+ TEM-20 (1 strain)
(Table 2). Negative PCR results for genes encoding SHV and OXA type
beta-lactamases were obtained for all analyzed strains.

The resistance percentages to non-beta-lactam antibiotics observed
in the 13 ESBL-positive E. coli strains were as follows: sulfonamides and
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 100%; nalidixic acid, 84.6%; ciproﬂox-
acin, 69.2%; tetracycline, 76.9%; streptomycin, 30.8%; gentamicin, 23.1%;
and chloramphenicol, 7.7%. Nine ESBL-positive strains showed simul-
taneous resistance to tetracycline, nalidixic acid, ciproﬂoxacin,

trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and sulfonamides, four of them were
also resistant to streptomycin, and other two also to gentamicin
(Table 2). A previous study carried out by our research group on E. coli
isolates recovered from food samples in Tunisia during 2006 demon-
strated the prevalence of CTX-M-1 with the concomitant presence of
isolates producing CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-8 beta-lactamases (Jouini
et al., 2007). A high prevalence of CTX-M-1 was also found in E. coli
recovered from chicken samples in France (Girlich et al., 2007). In
addition, previous studies showed that CTX-M-1 producing E. coli
strains were obtained from piglets and slaughter pigs from farms that
used ceftiofur but could not be detected on control farms without a
recent history of ceftiofur usage (Jørgensen et al., 2007).

The ISEcp1 insertion sequence was found upstream of the blaCTX-M-1
gene in nine of our strains (Table 2). The upstream region of the blaCTX-M-1
gene could not be identiﬁed in the remaining four E. coli strains (C1103,
C1106, C1116 and C1615) because all performed PCRs were negative. In
addition, orf477 (an open reading frame with unknown function) was
detected downstream of blaCTX-M-1 in all thirteen ESBL-positive strains
(Table 2), whereas none of the PCRs performed to detect IS26 sequence
surrounding the blaCTX-M-1 gene were positive. Similar structures with
ISEcp1 and orf477 surrounding the blaCTX-M-1 gene have been described in
previous reports (Abbassi et al., 2008; Eckert et al., 2004; Jouini et al.,
2007). ISEcp1 was ﬁrstly identiﬁed upstream of the plasmid-mediated
cephalosporinase gene blaCMY-4 from an E. coli isolate from the United
Kingdom (Eckert et al., 2006). Subsequently, several reports identiﬁed
ISEcp1-like sequences upstream of other blaCTX-M-type genes. These
results raise the question of the role of ISEcp1-like sequences in the
mobilization and expression of blaCTX-M genes, as has also been previously
indicated (Poirel et al., 2003; Eckert et al., 2006).

Speciﬁc culture media supplemented with broad-spectrum cepha-
losporins (cefotaxime or ceftazidime) is used in most studies which
analyze the carriage of ESBL-positive E. coli isolates in food samples;
this is the case of our study as well as of other studies (Weill et al.,
2004; Jouini et al., 2007), and a relatively high percentage of food
samples are found contaminated with ESBL-positive E. coli isolates.
Nevertheless, other studies analyze the prevalence of ESBL-positive
bacteria among E. coli isolates recovered from food samples in culture
media not supplemented with broad-spectrum cephalosporins; being
the prevalence very low or null in those studies (Jouini et al., 2009;
Souﬁ et al., 2009). All these results taken together indicate that the
proportion of ESBL-positive E. coli isolates among the total E. coli
population that could contaminate a food sample must be low and for
this reason, resistant strains are only detected when antimicrobial-
supplemented agar media is used for ESBL-positive E. coli detection.

3.4. Mechanisms of resistance in ESBL-negative E. coli strains with AmpC
phenotype

Three PFGE-unrelated E. coli strains, obtained from 3 different food
samples, showed resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid,
ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and cefoxitin and exhibited a negative screening
test for ESBL production. A positive PCR result for CMY-type beta-
lactamase was obtained in only one of these E. coli strains (C1619), and
sequencing of the identiﬁed amplicon resulted in identiﬁcation of the

CMY-2 type beta-lactamase (Table 3). The regulatory region of the
chromosomal ampC gene was ampliﬁed by PCR and sequenced in the
three ESBL-negative strains. Mutations in the promoter/attenuator region
of the ampC gene (at positions −42, −18, −1 and +58) were identiﬁed
in two of these three isolates (Table 3). It is known that speciﬁc mutations
in the ampC promoter region render an increase in the MIC values of
broad-spectrum cephalosporins as well as of cephamycins. In this sense,
mutations at positions −42 (C→T) and at −18 (G→A) create new −35
and −10 boxes separated by 17 bp, the optimal distance to enhance the
expression, resulting in the formation of a strong promoter (Caroff et al.,
2000; Haldorsen et al., 2008). The mutations at positions +58 and −28 of
the ampC attenuator region were found in E. coli C1619 which also
contained the blaCMY-2 gene (Table 3). An association between a mutation
at position −28 and over-expression of the ampC gene has not been
previously demonstrated.

E. coli and Salmonella strains carrying the CMY-2 type β-lactamase
have already been reported in food-producing animals and humans in
different countries and continents (Koeck et al., 1997; Winokur et al.,
2001; Blanc et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007). In USA, CMY-2 is highly prevalent
among E. coli and Salmonella strains from food-producing animals and
humans. The transfer of CMY-2 among different bacterial species and
between animals and humans has been suggested (Winokur et al., 2001).
Although CMY-2 enzyme has been already detected from a hospitalized
patient from the Libyan–Tunisian border region (Bauernfeind et al.,
1996), our work is the ﬁrst description of the CMY-2 beta-lactamase in
E. coli from food samples of animal origin in Tunisia.

3.5. Characterization of integrons and mechanism of resistance to
non-beta-lactam antimicrobial agents

The pattern of resistance to non-β-lactam antimicrobial agents in all
16 cefotaxime-resistant E. coli strains (ESBL-producers and ESBL-non-
producers) is shown in Tables 2 and 3. Fourteen E. coli strains showed
resistance to SXT and they were tested for the presence of class 1 and class
2 integrase genes. Thirteen strains contained the class 1 integrase gene
(intI1) and all of them were negative for class 2 integrase gene. The
variable region of class 1 integrons was characterized in all intI1-positive
strains (Tables 2 and 3). The dfrA1+aadA gene cassette array, conferring
resistance to trimethoprim and streptomycin/spectinomycin, respective-
ly, was identiﬁed in 6 strains (ﬁve ESBL-producers and one non-ESBL-
producers). The dfrA17+aadA5 gene cassettes were detected in the
remaining seven intI1-positive strains. The 3′-conserved segments of the
class 1 integrons usually contain the genetic determinants qacEΔ1 and
sul1 (Carattoli 2001). It is important to underline that eight of the 13
integron-positive isolates did not contain the conserved qacEΔ1-sul1
region, and the dfrA17+aadA5 gene cassettes were identiﬁed in most of
these strains. Similar to our study, class 1 integrons including dfr and aadA
gene cassettes have been the most prevalent type of integrons in E. coli
isolates from humans, animals and food in other studies (Trobos et al.,
2008; Vinué et al., 2008), even in E. coli isolates from food origin in Tunisia
(Jouini et al., 2007). A signiﬁcant association was shown between the
resistance to several antibiotics and the presence of class 1 integrons in E.
coli isolates. Resistance genes included in integrons constitute a reservoir
of antimicrobial resistance genes within microbial populations (Bass et al.,

K. Ben Slama et al. / International Journal of Food Microbiology 137 (2010) 281–286

285

1999) and integrons may contribute to the horizontal transfer of
resistance genes between bacteria of the same or of different species.

The results obtained in this study show that 93% of SXT-resistant
strains harbored a dfr gene conferring trimethoprim resistance. A
previous study demonstrated that integrons containing this gene
cassette contribute to the spread of trimethoprim resistance genes in
clinical isolates (Petersen et al., 2000). A probable explanation for the
high prevalence of dfr genes as cassettes could be that trimethoprim
associated with sulfamethoxazole is widely used in human and
animal medicine. According to previous studies, the aadA streptomy-
cin/spectinomycin resistance gene cassette detected in our study is
highly conserved in class 1 integrons among E. coli isolates of different
types and origins (Bass et al., 1999; Zhao et al., 2001). Streptomycin/
spectinomycin is scarcely used in humans, but continues to be
extensively used in agriculture and food animals and may contribute
to the selection of the corresponding resistance genes by the
horizontal transfer of some plasmids (Su et al., 2006).

A variety of other resistance genes were observed among our strains.
In this sense, tet(A) and tet(B) genes were detected in 7 and
5 tetracycline-resistant strains, respectively. Fifteen of the 16 cefotax-
ime-resistant strains harbored sul genes, and in most of the cases
contained more than one sul gene (sul1+sul2: 2 strains; sul1+sul3: 1
strain; sul1+sul2+sul3: 3 strains; sul2: 7 strains; sul2+sul3: 1 strain
and sul3: 1 strain). The aac(3)-II gene was identiﬁed in four gentamicin-
resistant strains.

The predominance of the tet(A) gene has already been described in
previous studies performed in Tunisia, Germany and Spain (Guerra et al.,
2003; Sáenz et al., 2004b; Jouini et al., 2007). Several studies showed that
tet efﬂux determinants were predominantly carried by plasmids and
associated with transposons (Chopra and Roberts 2001). Conjugative
plasmids contribute to the spread of efﬂux gene classes among Gram-
negative bacteria. The sul2 gene was the most prevalent gene detected in
our isolates (Tables 2 and 3), in accordance with previous observations
(Hammerum et al., 2006; Sunde and Norström 2006). However, sul1 gene
was the most prevalent in E. coli isolates from food origin in Tunisia
according to a previous investigation (Jouini et al., 2007).

The aac(3)-II gene, detected in three of our E. coli strains, had been
previously detected in E. coli isolates from food origin in Tunisia
(Jouini et al., 2007). It has been previously reported the inclusion of
this gene into mobile genetic elements and integrons that can
facilitate their horizontal transfer among bacteria (Heuer et al.,
2002; Carattoli 2003; Díaz et al., 2006).

In summary, the detection of ESBL-positive E. coli isolates in a high
percentage of food samples analyzed in this study (12.6%) is of special
relevance, indicating that food of animal origin represents a reservoir
of this type of resistant bacteria that potentially could be transferred
to humans through the food chain. In addition, it is also relevant the
detection of broad-spectrum-cephalosporin-resistant E. coli isolates
due to the production of plasmidic class C beta-lactamases or to over-
expression of the chromosomal ampC gene. More studies should be
performed in the future to analyze the ﬂow and evolution of broad-
spectrum-cephalosporin-resistant E. coli isolates in different ecosys-
tems in order to assess its implication in human health.
