Abstract

In two branches of poultry culture; small local ones and big industrial ones, tetracycline is a common antibiotic, which 
has been taken as a standard antibiotic in this study. 20 isolates were taken from big poultry farms like Agha Ltd and 
Denm Poultry. 10 isolates were taken from small local poultry farms like Rahat Poultry and Star Poultry. After collection 
of samples, total numbers of bacteria with and without tetracycline were counted. In both cases numerous bacterial 
growths were observed. The normal dose of tetracycline is 30 µg/ml which failed extremely to regulate high bacterial 
growth. Two dilutions (10-3 and 10-4) of sample 1, 2, 3 and 4 were taken and allowed to grow at different concentrations 
of tetracycline like 30,60 and 100 µg/ml, where bacterial growth was observed. High concentration of antibiotics for 
example,  above  100  µg/ml  may  be  harmful  to  humans  and  animals. After  performing  sensitivity  test  against  other 
commonly used antibiotics in poultry, it was found that isolated tetracycline-resistant E. coli were 100% resistant to 
penicillin and erythromycin,100 sensitive to imipenem, 93.34% resistant to tetracycline, 23.03% resistant to gentamycin 
and  53.33%  resistant  to  chloramphenicol. These  indicated  the  multidrug  resistant  property  of  isolates.  Subsequent 
agarose gel electrophoresis showed no plasmid DNA band in the gel indicating non-existence of any bacterial plasmid 
and also proved that the observed resistance was chromosomal gene-mediated or at least not plasmid mediated. 

The  hope  ushered  by  the  discovery  of  antimicrobials  has  been 
tainted by the emergence of bacterial strains which are able to resist this 
therapeutics. Due to the use and misuse of antimicrobials in the last 
few decades, today’s clinically important bacteria are not only single 
drug resistant but also multiple antibiotics resistant. These multidrug 
resistant bacteria are increasing public health hazard all over the world 
[1]. Antimicrobial susceptible bacteria are substantially less responsible 
for causing infections compared to the antimicrobial-resistant bacteria 
which  actually  cause  infections  leading  to  higher  rates  of  morbidity 
and  mortality  [2].  The  reason  behind  this  high  rate  is  that,  these 
antimicrobial-resistant  microorganisms  are  resistant  to  conventional 
treatment and can cause serious infection resulting in prolonged illness 
and greater death risk. Annually, about 440,000 new cases of Multidrug-
resistant  Tuberculosis  (MDR-TB)  are  reported,  causing  no  less  than 
150,000  deaths.  In  most  malaria-endemic  countries,  widespread 
resistance  to  earlier  generation  antimalarial  medicines,  such  as, 
chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is seen [3]. Over the past 
decade, intercontinental spread of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus  [4]  and  penicillin  resistant  Streptococcus  pneumonia  [5],  has 
progressed and has given rise to concerns about increasing resistance 
of Salmonella typhi [6]. It has proved the parochial approach to be a 
failure. Most antibiotic use is in two areas: in humans in the community, 
and in animals for growth promotion and prophylaxis. 20-50% human 
uses  of  antibiotics  are  unnecessary  and  40-80%  agricultural  uses  of 
antibiotics are highly questionable [7]. In the Southern Netherlands, 
almost 80 percent of raw chicken supplied by the grocery stores was 
found to be containing multidrug-resistant bacteria. When these germs 
were compared with the speciments collected from hospital patients, 
researchers found that, the predominant resistant genes were identical 
[8]. Antimicrobial resistance has been recognized by the World Health 
Organization (WHO) as a global problem that calls for global response. 

Keeping the problem in view, WHO issued the global principles for the 
containment of antimicrobial resistance in animal intended for food. 
After  some  recommended  interventions,  the  WHO  global  strategy 
for the containment of antimicrobial resistance will hopefully enable 
local  authorities  to  reduce  the  spread  of  resistance  and  slow  down 
its emergence in diverse setting [9,10]. These guidelines recommend 
prudent  use  of  antimicrobials  and  the  establishment  of  surveillance 
programmes for antimicrobial consumption and resistance and further 
research as well.

(Rahat Poultry) are small local poultry farms. Samples collected from 
each of these poultries were- a) raw feces from the inside of the farms, 
b) feces from the open fields beside the farms which were thrown away 
as waste products.
Transportation of the sample

After  collection  the  samples  were  placed  in  a  sterile  ice-bag 
containing ice and were transported to the laboratory of Department of 
Microbiology, University of Chittagong. 
Processing of samples

Samples  were  allowed  to  reach  room  temperature  and  then  10 
gm of fresh fecal sample was mixed with 90ml of sterile normal saline 
and shook to form homogenous mixture. All samples were mixed by 
vigorous shaking.
Bacteriological count

All  the  bacteriological  enumerations  were  carried  out  by  pour 
plate method. In this case total number of bacteria and total number of 
resistant bacteria were counted [11].
Total Viable Count (TVC) with and without antibiotic

1  ml  of  from  10-2,  10-3,  10-4 and  10-5  dilutions  were  poured  into 
different  sterile  Petri  plates.  The  Nutrient  agar  media  (temperature 
45°C) were poured into each petri-plate. After solidification, the plates 
were  incubated  at  37°C  for  24  hours  at  inverted  position.  After  24 
hours, plates with 30-300 bacterial colonies were counted.

 There is a difference between total viable count without antibiotic 
and  total  viable  count  with  antibiotic.  In  case  of  total  viable  count 
with antibiotic, antibiotics (30 µg/ml tetracycline) were mixed to the 
sterilized  media  (temperature  45°C)  and  were  shaken  well  before 
plating.
Transferring  single  colonies  from  NA  plates  to  EMB  agar 
media

Single colonies were picked up randomly by sterile tooth picks from 
plates (with different concentration of Tetracycline). The colonies were 
then streaked on individual EMB agar containing 30 µg/ml tetracycline. 
The EMB plates were incubated at 37° C for 24 hours.
Transferring to broth culture

After  incubation,  presence  of  growth  with  green  metallic  sheen 
was  observed  on  the  EMB  plates.  One  loopful  from  such  growths 
was  transferred  randomly  to  3  ml  of  nutrient  broth  (in  10ml  screw 
cap tubes) containing 30 µg/ml tetracycline samples. 30 such growths 
(10  from  sample-1,  10  from  sample-2,  5  from  sample-3  and  5  from 
sample-4) were transferred patching from all of the samples. The 30 
culture tubes were then allowed for incubation at 37°C for 24 hours 
with loose capping and vigorous shaking of over 250 rpm.
Identification of the Isolated E. coli 
Microscopic examination of morphology bacteria

The size, shape, arrangements and Gram reactions of the 24 hour 

bacterial cultures were observed in a microscopical field [12].
Conventional biochemical test for the identification of E. coli 

tests  were  carried  out 

Conventional  Biochemical 

the 
identification  of  E.  coli.  The  tests  are-  Indole  test,  Methyl-red  test, 
Voges-proskauer test, Citrate test and Motility test. Tetracycline (30 µg/
ml) was present in all biochemical tests.
Antimicrobial  susceptibility  of  the  microorganisms  to 
antibiotics

for 

The  standard  disc  diffusion  method  also  known  as  Kirby  Bauer 
method [13] was used for the in vitro determination of the sensitivity 
to the antimicrobial agents.
Antibiotic disc used

Antibiotics were chosen so  that some of  them were used  during 
sample collection (e.g. tetracycline), some of them were continuously 
used in the poultry in addition to the running antibiotics, some of them 
were moderately or rarely used in poultry farms, some of them were not 
used (e.g. Imipenem and Gentamycin) (Table 1).
Plate preparation

A cotton swab was dipped in the suspension prepared in compliance 
with  McFarland  solution,  excess  fluid  was  removed  by  pressing  and 
rotating the cotton bar inside the wall of the tube just above the fluid 
level. Then the swab was streaked over the surface of the Muller-Hinton 
agar medium to obtain uniform inoculums and some plates were also 
prepared by pour plate method.
Preparation and application of the disc to the plates

The discs were then placed on the surface of the seeded plates at 
appropriate  spatial  arrangement  by  using  a  sterile  forceps.  Then  the 
plates were inoculated at 37°C for 24 hours and observed for the clear 
zone of inhibition.
Observation of clear zone of inhibition

After incubation the zones of complete inhibition were measured 

by using MD8 Scan Zone Reader.
Plasmid isolation

Plasmid extraction procedure was carried out following the protocol 
developed by ICDDRB. The extracted plasmid was then isolated using a 
horizontal 1% Agarose Gel Electrophoresis technique.
Preparation of the sample

The  pure  cultures  were  transferred  to  10  ml  screw  cap  tubes 
containing 3 ml Luria Bertani (LB) broth with 30 μg/ml tetracycline. 
The  broths  were  then  incubated  at  37°C  with  loose  capping  and 
vigorous  shaking  (200  rpm)  for  overnight.  Then  inoculums  were 
transferred to another 3 ml LB broth at a 1:200 ml rate containing same 
concentration of tetracycline and incubated for 4-6 hours at 37°C with 
loose capping and vigorous shaking (200 rpm). After sufficient growth

with slight turbidity the incubation stopped and the cells were prepared 
for extraction.
Plasmid extraction 

1.0ml of overnight culture was taken in an Eppendorf’s tube (1.5ml) 
and cells were collected by centrifugation for 7 minutes at 12,000 rpm. 
The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was thoroughly suspended 
in 100 μl of solution I and the solution was kept at room temperature 
(32°C) for 10 min.

Then  200  μl  of  solution  II  (lysis  solution)  was  added  and  mixed 
gently by inverting the tube for a few times. After that 150 μl of ice-cold 
solution III (neutralizing solution) was added and mixed vigorously by 
vortexing for a few seconds. The tubes were kept on ice for 5 minutes. 
The  mixture  was  then  centrifuged  at  12,000  rpm  for  15  minutes  to 
pellet  the  chromosomal  DNA.  The  clear  supernatant  (approximately 
400 μl) was taken to fresh Eppendorf’s tubes. Then two volumes of cold 
95% ethanol (800 μl) were added in each tube and vortexes for a few 
seconds to mix well. It was then kept in room temperature for about 
20 minutes for DNA precipitation. The precipitated DNA was collected 
by centrifugation for 15 minutes at 12,000 rpm. The supernatant was 
discarded and the pellet was dried in a drier at 45°C for 20 minutes. 
Finally the dried DNA was dissolved in 30 μl TE buffer and kept at 4°C.
Separation of plasmid DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis

Plasmid  DNA  was  separated  by  horizontal  electrophoresis  in 
1%  agarose  slab  gels  in  a  Tris-Acetate  EDTA  (TAE)  buffer  at  room 
temperature at 80 volt (50 mA) for 3 h. briefly, 30 µl of plasmid DNA 
solution was mixed with 3 µl of tracking dye (Appendix) and was loaded 
into the individual well of the gel. The gel (5mm thick) was stained with 
0.5 µg/ml of ethydium bromide for 15 min at room temperature and 
then distained with distilled water for 10 min.

Other  most  common  type  of  antibiotics  like  penicillin,  imepenem, 
chloramphenicol, erythromycin and gentamycin were used to observe 
multi-drug resistance. 20 isolates were taken from big poultry farms 
like  Agha  Ltd  and  Denm  Poultry.  10  isolates  were  taken  from  small 
local poultry farms like Rahat Poultry and Star Poultry. After collection 
of sample, total number of bacteria with and without antibiotics was 
counted.  In  both  cases  numerous  bacterial  growths  were  observed. 
The normal dose of tetracycline is 30 µg/ml which failed extremely to 
regulate high bacterial growth. The samples labeled with number 1, 2, 
3, and 4 were allowed to grow at different concentrations of tetracycline 
(30, 60 and 100 µg /ml) where bacterial growth was observed. After 
performing sensitivity test against other commonly used antibiotics in 
poultry, it was found that isolated tetracycline-resistant E. coli were 100% 
resistant to penicillin and erythromycin, 100% sensitive to imipenem, 
93.34%  resistant  to  tetracycline,  23.03%  resistant  to  gentamycin  and 
53.33%  resistant  to  chloramphenicol.  These  indicated  the  multidrug 
resistant  property  of  isolates.  A  statistically  significant  [12]  Increase 
in antibiotic resistance was observed among outpatient and inpatient 
isolates of E. coli. Subsequent Agarose Gel Electrophoresis showed no 
plasmid-DNA band in the gel indicating non-existence of any bacterial 
plasmid  proving  that  observed  resistance  was  chromosomal  gene-
mediated or at least not plasmid mediated. Observation of the multi-
drug resistance character of poultry fecal isolates is a terrible warning 
to natural environment [15,16]. The poultry feces used by farmers as 
manure can poison the crop. Poultry feces is also used as a common 
feed  for  fish,  so  these  fish  containing  multi-drug  resistant  culture  of 
bacteria like E. coli can be deadly for humans and animals, that is, for 
any  fish  eaters.  Antibiotics  resistance  in  bacteria  associate  with  food 
animals and the use of antibiotics for agricultural purposes, particularly 
for  growth  enhancement,  contributed  to  the  increased  prevalence 
of  antibiotic-resistant  bacteria.  Our  finding  proposed  that  proper 
antibiotics should be used at proper doses to avoid the development 
of  multi-drug  resistant  bacteria.  To  perform  these,  skilled  workers

chloramphenicol (Figure 8 and Tables 6-8). 

Total  30  isolates  were  subjected  to  plasmid  DNA  extraction  and 
they were analyzed in 1% Agarose. The results are negative and no band 
was found (Figure 9).
Discussion

Random use of antibiotics without medical indication in Poultry 
and  adult  dairy  cows  are  a  common  phenomenon  these  days.  This 
contributes  to  the  increase  of  antimicrobial  resistance  and  indirectly 
exposes human beings to these pathogens [14]. In this study, poultry, 
a  popular  and  widespread  business  was  selected  to  observe  its 
contribution to the development of multi-drug resistant E. coli. We have 
divided  Poultry  two  branches-small  local  culture  and  big  industrial 
culture.  Various  types  of  antibiotics  are  being  used  in  these  poultry 
industry. The most common types of antibiotic that is used in poultry 
are  tetracycline-which  was  used  as  standard  antibiotic  in  this  study.

with sound knowledge of antibiotics are essential. For personal-small 
poultry farm, the related individuals should take training on the use 
antibiotics.  The  waste  of  poultry  should  be  disposed  off  properly  to 
avoid the spread of multi-drug resistant bacteria in the environment.
