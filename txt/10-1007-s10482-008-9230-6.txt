Abstract Fifteen (15) backyard farms were inves-
tigated to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility
and invasion ability of S. aureus isolates from cows
with subclinical mastitis in Me´xico. A total of 106
cows were sampled and 31 S. aureus isolates were
recovered. S. aureus isolates were resistant to peni-
cillin class antibiotics and susceptible to gentamicin
and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. STA9 and
STA13 isolates were resistant
to erythromycin
(MIC [ 25 lg/ml) and lincomycin (STA13, MIC [
25 lg/ml; STA9, MIC [ 100 lg/ml). STA9 isolate
harbors the erm(B) and msr(A) genes, whereas
STA13 isolate harbors the erm(C) gene. STA9 and
STA13 isolates contains the lnu(A) gene. Only 5
isolates
(STA11, STA13, STA14, STA15 and
STA21) were able to internalize in bovine mammary
epithelial cells. These results indicate that S. aureus
isolates from dairy backyard farms showed differ-
ences in the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and
invasion ability in bovine mammary epithelial cells.
This kind of evaluations should be performed in

Introduction

Bovine mastitis is a major disease affecting the dairy
industry that results in economic loses and decreased
animal health (Ruegg 2003). This disease is charac-
terized by an inﬂammatory response of the mammary
tissue. The predominantly contagious pathogens
responsible for clinical and subclinical infections in
lactating cows are the Gram positive bacteria Staph-
ylococcus aureus (Kerro-Dego et al. 2002). Some
bacteria responsible of mastitis have the ability to
invade the mammary epithelium and the limited
success of antibiotic therapy may be due to the ability
of S. aureus to invade and survive within the cell
(Buzzola et al. 2007). In addition, bacterial isolates
associated with mastitis have different capacity to

invade isolated bovine mammary epithelial cells
(bMEC) (Wanasinghe 1981; Watts 1988; Yancey
1999; Anaya-Lo´pez et al. 2006).

Antimicrobial

therapy is a valuable tool

for
controlling mastitis and several studies regarding to
susceptibility patterns of different mastitis pathogens
have been reported elsewhere (De Oliveira et al.
2000; Anderson et al. 2006; Srinivasan et al. 2007).
Different studies have demonstrated an increasing
resistance frequency among mastitis pathogens (Myl-
lys et al. 1998) or a growing susceptibility (Erskine
et al. 2002), whereas others reporting no change
(Makovec and Ruegg 2003). In the antimicrobial
therapy of mastitis, macrolides,
lincosamide, and
streptogramin (MLS) antibiotics are used in the
treatment of staphylococcal infections (Lu¨thje and
Schwarz 2006). As a consequence, resistance to MLS
antibiotics is prevalent among S. aureus and coagu-
lase negative staphylococci
(CoNS) and a large
number of genes mediating resistance by different
mechanisms have been identiﬁed (Khan et al. 2000;
Lu¨thje et al. 2007; Lu¨thje and Schwarz 2007).

backyard farms in Morelia, Michoaca´n, Me´xico
(Table 1). Isolates were collected from March 2004
to January 2005. Aliquots (200 ll) from milk samples
were collected aseptically and distributed on Blood
agar plates (Bioxon, Me´xico), then were incubated at
37°C for 24 h. Staphylococcus aureus isolates were
identiﬁed by standard biochemical tests. The isolates
were further characterized by molecular analysis
amplifying the gene nuc encoding staphylococcal
thermostable nuclease (Table 2)
(Brakstad et al.
1992). The American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) S. aureus subsp. aureus 27543 strain,
isolated from a case of clinical mastitis was included
as a positive control. Prior to invasion assays bacteria
were grown at 37°C overnight in Luria-Bertani broth
(LB, Bioxon, Me´xico) and colony forming units
(CFU) were adjusted by measuring the optical density
at 600 nm. Isolates were identiﬁed by the letters STA
followed by an arabic number.

In Me´xico, milk production from dairy backyard
systems contribute for
the national
production, however these systems have been poorly
studied. In contrast
the
backyard systems are conﬁned to small spaces mainly
in the house’s backyards, the livestock does not have
a high genetic quality and the practices of genetic
improvement or preventive medicine are scarce
(Me´ndez y Cazarı´n et al. 2000). Conversely, only
limited information is available about the antimicro-
bial susceptibility and invasive ability of bacteria
isolated from bovine maintained in dairy backyard
systems (Lo´pez-Meza et al. 2006). The aim of the
present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial
resistance and invasive ability of S. aureus isolates
associated with mastitis from dairy backyard systems
in Morelia, Michoaca´n, Me´xico.

Materials and methods

Staphylococcus aureus isolates

A total of 106 cows were analyzed and 31 S. aureus
isolates were obtained from raw milk composite
samples of cows with subclinical mastitis (deter-
mined by California mastitis test) maintained in 15

All S. aureus isolates were tested for antibiotic and
quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC) suscepti-
bility. Antibiotics susceptibility was determined by
the disk diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton (MH)
agar plates (Bioxon, Me´xico). The following disks
were used (Gram positive multidisc, Bio-Rad, Me´x-
30 lg;
ico):
cefotaxime, 30 lg; ceftazidime, 30 lg; cefuroxime,
30 lg; dicloxacillin, 1 lg; erythromycin, 15 lg;
gentamicin, 10 lg; peﬂoxacin, 5 lg; penicillin, 10
U; tetracycline, 30 lg; trimethoprim, 25 lg. Isolates
were classiﬁed as
intermediate and
resistant according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Susceptibility to lincomycin and QAC was tested on
MH agar plates containing different concentrations of
lincomycin (1–20 lg/ml, Pharmacia) and cetyltri-
methylammonium bromide (1–10 lg/ml, CTAB,
Sigma). A MH agar plate without antimicrobials
was used as a control for each isolate. Plates were
incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Isolates with conﬂuent or
semiconﬂuent growth on MH agar containing linco-
mycin at 10 lg/ml or CTAB at 6 lg/ml were
considered resistant. The minimum inhibitory con-
centrations

The ﬁrst dilution with no visible growth was consid-

PCR ampliﬁcation of resistance genes

Genomic DNA was extracted from S. aureus isolates
as reported previously and used as a template for
ampliﬁcation (Pospiech and Neumann 1995). Primers
(Invitrogen) and PCR conditions used in this study
were those reported by Lina et al.
(1999). The
primers allow the identiﬁcation of 6 determinants of
resistance to macrolides (erythromycin) and lincosa-
mides (lincomycin) (Table 2). PCR was carried out
on a GeneAmp PCR System 2400 (Perkin-Elmer).
DNA ampliﬁcation of gyrA was used to test
the

quality of the DNA extraction and for the absence of
PCR inhibitors. PCR products were analyzed by
electrophoresis through 1% agarose gels (Invitrogen).

Cell cultures

The isolation of primary bovine mammary epithelial
cells (bMEC) was performed from alveolar tissue of
udders of lactating cows as described previously
(Anaya-Lo´pez et al. 2006). Cells from passages 2nd
to 8th were cultured in Petri dishes (Corning-Costar)
in growth medium composed by DMEM medium/

Results

Collect of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from
backyard systems and evaluation of antimicrobial
susceptibility

In a regional program for the study of mastitis, 106
cows from 15 backyard systems were analyzed

during the period of March 2004 to January 2005.
According to California mastitis test, 29% of cows
analyzed showed subclinical mastitis (31 cows).
Samples of raw milk from these cows were collected
and used to obtain S. aureus isolates. Thirty one S.
aureus isolates were identiﬁed according to growth
and biochemical properties
(catalase, coagulase,
gelatinase, and mannitol fermentation). The identiﬁ-
cation of
the isolates was conﬁrmed by PCR
amplifying the gene nuc encoding staphylococcal
thermostable nuclease. The environmental pathogens
responsible of mastitis, Escherichia coli and Klebsi-
ella pneumoniae, were also isolated but no were
included in this study.

Antimicrobial susceptibility of standard S. aureus
ATCC 27543 strain and 31 S. aureus isolates to 14
antimicrobials was evaluated (Table 1). The standard
S. aureus ATCC 27543 strain showed resistance only
to ampicillin and penicillin. In general, the S. aureus
isolates from mastitis showed a variable susceptibility
behavior towards the antibiotics tested. Isolates that
were resistant to two or more antimicrobials belonging
to different antimicrobial groups were considered as
multidrug resistant. All S. aureus isolates were resis-
tant to two or more antimicrobials. The 31 S. aureus
isolates were resistant
to ampicillin, ceftazidime,
dicloxacillin and penicillin; many were resistant to
cefuroxime (35%), cefotaxime (29%) and cephalotin
(29%); and \10% were resistant to erythromycin,
trimethoprim, peﬂoxacin, lincomycin and tetracycline
(Table 1). All S. aureus isolates were susceptible to
gentamicin (10 lg). Regarding to CTAB tests, all
isolates showed growth in the presence of 1 lg/ml
CTAB. Nevertheless, none of the isolates grew at
concentrations [5 lg/ml CTAB. These results mean
that all isolates are susceptible to CTAB.

We found that only STA9 and STA13 S. aureus
isolates were resistant to erythromycin and lincomy-
cin antibiotics
(Table 1) and were selected to
determined the MIC values. The STA9 isolate
showed MIC values of [25 lg/ml to erythromycin
and [100 lg/ml to lincomycin, whereas the STA13
isolate showed MIC values of [25 lg/ml to erythro-
mycin and lincomycin. Further, STA9 and STA13
macrolides and lincosamide resistant isolates were
investigated for the genetic basis of resistance. PCR
analyses revealed that STA9 isolate harbors the
erm(B) and msr(A) genes consistent with an eryth-
romycin resistance phenotype. Also, the lnu(A) gene

was detected in the same isolate. In relation to STA13
isolate, the genes erm(C) and lnu(A) were detected.
The other macrolides and lincosamide resistance
genes were not detected in these isolates.

Invasion assays of Staphylococcus aureus isolates
in bMEC

Bacterial invasion into epithelial cells is an important
pathogenic mechanism for the establishment of the
disease, due to this, the invasive ability of 31 S. aureus
isolates and the standard S. aureus ATCC 27543 strain
was evaluated in bMEC monolayers. According to CFU
recovered, only 5 isolates (STA11, STA13, STA14,
STA15 and STA21) were able to internalize into bMEC
(Table 1) with values higher than 20% relative to the
invasive ability of S. aureus ATCC 27543 strain. From
these 5 isolates, the STA15 isolate showed the highest
invasion ability (80%). The other isolates evaluated in
this study have values \9% and were considered not
able to penetrate bMEC cells. The internalization of S.
aureus into bMEC was also demonstrated by transmis-
sion electron microscopy (Fig. 1).

Discussion

In this study, we assessed the antimicrobial resistance
and invasion abilities of S. aureus isolates from cases
of bovine mastitis in dairy backyard farms. This
bacterium is one of the most frequently isolated
pathogen causing clinical or subclinical mastitis

In Me´xico the dairy
(Kerro-Dego et al. 2002).
backyard farms are very important for milk produc-
tion, but the studies on antimicrobial resistance in
bacteria associated to mastitis in these systems are
poor (Me´ndez y Cazarı´n et al. 2000). Antimicrobial
susceptibility evaluation for mastitis pathogens is
complicated by the lack of
interpretive criteria
speciﬁc for most mastitis antimicrobials, and fre-
quently
antimicrobial
susceptibility data uses the criteria applied with
human data (De Oliveira et al. 2000). In this study,
we detected a high level of resistance to penicillin
class antibiotics, the 31 S. aureus isolates analyzed
showed resistance to ampicillin, ceftazidime, diclox-
acillin and penicillin (Table 1). In this region of
study, penicillin class antibiotics have been fre-
quently used for the control of mastitis, and exert a
high selection pressure on the bacteria resulting in the
development of resistance. Nevertheless, all isolates
showed high sensitivity levels to gentamicin, and in
less proportion to erythromycin and lincomycin. On
the other hand, the dairy industry commonly uses
quaternary ammonium-based detergents, such as
CTAB and benzalkonium chloride,
to clean and
wash dairy equipment. As consequence, S. aureus
isolates have developed resistance to such detergents
(Bjorland et al. 2001). All 31 S. aureus isolates
evaluated were susceptible to CTAB at concentrations
[5 lg/ml detergent. The milk samples were from
backyard farms where the application of disinfectant
elaborated with QAC’s is not a common practice.
Thus,
the absence of a selection pressure could
explain the lack of resistance to CTAB.

A detailed evaluation of susceptibility to antibiot-
ics of different classes is important in order to obtain
basic information leading to the identiﬁcation and
characterization of the gene or gene pools that confer
resistance to one particular antibiotic class. MLS
antibiotics are widely used in the treatment of
staphylococcal infections and resistance to antibiotics
is prevalent among staphylococci (Lina et al. 1999;
Lu¨thje and Schwarz 2006). We found two isolates
(STA9 and STA13) with resistance to MLS erythro-
mycin and lincomycin antibiotics. PCR analysis
showed that isolate STA9 harbors the erm(B) and
msr(A) erythromycin resistance determinant whereas
the isolate STA13 only has the erm(C) gene. erm(B)
and erm(C) genes confer resistance to MLS type B
(MLSB) by target site alteration of the ribosome,

these gene
determinants have been reported in staphylococci
from bovine subclinical mastitis in Germany (Lu¨thje
and Schwarz 2006). Likewise, both isolates have the
lnu(A) genes which confer resistance to lincosa-
mides. In this trend, we previously have reported the
complete sequence of the lnu(A)-carrying plasmid
pBMSa1 of S. aureus isolate from bovine mastitis
collected in an extensive farm,
responsible for
lincomycin resistance (Loeza-Lara et al. 2004). In
addition, recently several lnu(A)-carrying plasmids of
staphylococci isolates from bovine mastitis have been
characterized (Lu¨thje et al. 2007).

Although S. aureus is the most frequently isolated
pathogen causing clinical or subclinical mastitis
worldwide, in vitro studies have shown the invasion
ability of only a few isolates into bovine mammary
epithelial cells (Almeida et al. 1996; Hensen et al.
2000; Anaya-Lo´pez et al. 2006). We found that 5
isolates were able to internalize into bMEC cells
(Table 1). This invasion was corroborated by trans-
mission electron microscopy (Fig. 1). In different
countries only a limited number of
isolates of
S. aureus are responsible for most of the cases of
bovine mastitis, which could be related to differences
in their invasion or adhesion capability (Kerro-Dego
et al. 2002). Even so, the pathogenesis of S. aureus
infection is very complex, it has been demonstrated
that S. aureus isolates belonging to different agr
groups showing different abilities to invade MAC-T
cells (Buzzola et al. 2007). However, the isolates
used in our study need further molecular character-
ization in order to explain the differences detected in
the degrees of internalization into bMEC cells.

In conclusion, antimicrobial resistance evaluation
could be a usual practice in dairy backyard farms
management. Additionally,
the characterization of
intracellular invasion of bacteria associated to bovine
mastitis could be important for the understanding of this
disease. This kind of evaluations should be performed in
different dairy regions, since resistance patterns and
isolate diversity vary on a per-region basis.
