Livestock-associated  meticillin-resistant  Staphylococcus  aureus  (LA-MRSA)  is  an  increasingly  important 
public health concern worldwide; however, data on LA-MRSA from Asian countries is scarce. As such, 
a comprehensive molecular epidemiological survey of S. aureus along a pork production chain and in 
the community was undertaken in Shandong Province, China. spa typing and whole-genome sequencing 
were used to survey the occurrence and potential transmission of S. aureus in various sectors, including 
899 porcine samples (snout or skin swabs, carcass swabs and pork portions), 845 human nasal samples 
and 239 environmental samples from commercial farms, a slaughterhouse, a pork wholesale market and 
the surrounding community. MRSA was detected in higher frequencies in samples from two commercial 
pig farms (pigs, 49%; farm workers, 64%; environmental samples, 16%) than in samples from the slaugh- 
terhouse (fatteners, 8.2%; carcasses, 1.1%; operation workers, 0%; environmental samples, 3.8%), the pork 
wholesale market (pork, 14%; sellers, 0%) and individuals in the community (6.8%). There were signiﬁcant 
differences in population structures, antimicrobial susceptibility proﬁles, and the presence of resistance 
and virulence genes between human- and pig-associated isolates. The phylogenetic analysis conﬁrmed the 
dissemination of LA-MRSA between various segments along the pork production chain. However, MRSA 
of the same sequence type was not found to be disseminated between the commercial farms and the 
surrounding communities. Furthermore, one MRSA ST398 was observed, and a novel CC9 variant ST3597 
was detected within the chain. The high MRSA carriage rates and the emergence of a new MRSA CC9 
variant identiﬁed in this study highlight the need for MRSA surveillance.

ognized public health concern [1–4] . In China, the occurrence and 
epidemiology of LA-MRSA have not been studied extensively com- 
pared  with  European  countries.  One  major  difference  noted  in 
China is that the LA-MRSA identiﬁed mainly belong to clonal com- 
plex (CC) 9 [4] , whereas LA-MRSA CC398 dominates in Europe [5] . 
CC9 isolates were ﬁrst reported in pigs and people with occupa- 
tional contact with pigs in 2008 in China [6,7] , but only a limited 
number of studies have described CC9 from livestock or slaugh- 
terhouses  in  China  [4,8] .  These  studies  do  not  generally  provide 
in-depth molecular data, which are needed to understand the re- 
latedness and adaption of LA-MRSA CC9 within the pig industry

and other settings. Since more than half of the world’s pig stock 
∼435  million)  resides  in  China  [9] ,  these  animals  could  repre- 
( 
sent  the  largest  LA-MRSA  reservoir  in  the  world.  It  is  therefore 
important to gain insight into the occurrence and potential spread 
of LA-MRSA in pork production, its environment and surrounding 
community in China. 

To improve knowledge about the LA-MRSA situation in China, 
a  cross-sectional  study  investigating  both  MRSA  and  meticillin- 
susceptible  S.  aureus  (MSSA)  was  conducted.  The  study  included 
samples from a typical Chinese pork production chain, operation 
workers,  the  environment  and  surrounding  community  residents 
in Shandong Province, China. To give insight into the epidemiology 
of MRSA and MSSA from pig to pork in the environment and sur- 
rounding community, spa typing, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) 
and bioinformatic analysis were performed. 

2. Materials and methods 

2.1. Study population and sample collection 

In April 2016, samples were collected from a typical commercial 
pork production chain attached to a local pork producing company 
in  Shandong,  the  fourth-largest  pig-producing  province  in  China 
[10] . The production chain was part of a vertically integrated sys- 
tem, meaning that pigs at commercial farms are produced exclu- 
sively for a local slaughterhouse and the pork wholesale market. 
Samples were collected from two pig farms, designated Farm A and 
∼4.5 km apart) with capacities of 1500 and 30 0 0 pigs, re- 
Farm B ( 
spectively; a slaughterhouse, processing 10 0 0–150 0 pigs/day; and a 
pork wholesale market. Samples were also collected in three com- 
munities adjacent to the investigated pork production chain: Com- 
∼1.5 
munity 1, 
∼2.0 km from Farm A. Each 
km from Farm B; and Community 3, 
∼150 households and, based on an esti- 
community consisted of 
mated detection rate of 10% (from local Centre for Disease Con- 
trol and Prevention), 40 random households were contacted. In the 
∼20  households  per  community  participated.  A  nasal  swab 
end, 
was collected from one adult volunteer from each household (Fig. 
S1, see online supplementary material).

For  pig  snout  and  human  nasal  swabs,  the  ESwab  system 
(Copan,  Brescia,  Italy)  was  used  according  to  the  manufacturer’s 
instructions.  Snout  swabs  were  collected  randomly  from  sows

Pork portions ( n

tem, respectively. Air samples were collected in each pig pen in

ing a Sennon JWL-S6 air sampler (Beijing, China) with CHROMagar 
MRSA  and  CHROMagar  Staphylococcus  aureus  (CHROMagar  Com- 
pany, Paris, France) plates, respectively (Table S1 and Fig. S1, see

included  in  this  study  [11]  for  comparison  of  the  epidemiology 
of MRSA and MSSA from humans with and without backyard pig 
farms,  as  well  as  from  pigs  between  the  commercial  farms  and 
backyard farms. These samples were collected in July 2015 from

pigs (skin swabs behind the ear, n 
 404) and humans (nasal swabs, 
=
n 
 753) from 245 and 753 households, respectively (Table 1 and 
Fig. S1, see online supplementary material) [12] . 

2.2. Cultivation and veriﬁcation of MSSA and MRSA 

From ESwab tubes, 0.2 mL of transport liquid was transferred 
to  1.3  mL  of  7.5%  sodium  chloride  broth  (Land  Bridge,  Beijing, 
China) and incubated overnight at 35 °C, after which cultures were 
plated  on  CHROMagar  MRSA  and  CHROMagar  S.  aureus  (CHRO- 
Magar Co.), respectively. One single putative MRSA and S. aureus 
colony was selected from the respective plate and subcultured on 
Baird–Parker agar (Land Bridge) overnight at 35 °C. The suspected 
colonies  were  conﬁrmed  as  S.  aureus  using  matrix-assisted  laser 
desorption  ionization-time  of  ﬂight  mass  spectrometry  (Bruker, 
Bremen, Germany), with the suspected MRSA conﬁrmed by poly- 
merase chain reaction [13] . 

Eﬄuents,  soil,  pork  portions  and  surface  samples  were  pre- 
enriched in BHI broth (Land Bridge) for 2 h at 35 °C to collect sus- 
pected S. aureus isolates within those fractal samples. A total of 
0.2  mL  of  pre-enriched  BHI  broth  was  transferred  to  1.3  mL  of 
7.5% sodium chloride broth for further enrichment, and was sub- 
sequently processed as the samples collected with Eswab. 

2.3. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing 

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using broth 
microdilution, and interpreted according to the Clinical and Labo- 
ratory Standards documents VET08 [14] and M100-S28 [15] . S. au- 
reus ATCC 29213 was used as the control strain. 

2.4. Genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis 

MRSA and MSSA isolates identiﬁed were subjected to spa typ- 
ing  [16] ,  and  spa  type  was  assigned  using  spa -plugin  in  BioNu- 
merics  v7.6  (Applied  Maths,  Sint-Martens-Latem,  Belgium).  Min- 
imum  spanning  trees  based  on  spa  types  were  constructed  in 
BioNumerics.  Based  on  spa  types  and  background  information 
regarding  source  and  location,  representative  MSSA  and  MRSA 
isolates were selected for WGS and sequenced using Illumina tech- 
nology [17] . Multi-locus sequence types (MLST) were assigned ac- 
cording  to  the  S.  aureus  MLST  database  [18]  by  mapping  reads 
to  alleles  using  SRST2  [19] .  Antimicrobial  resistance  (AMR)  and 
virulence genes were screened using a mapping approach imple- 
mented  in  SRST2  against  the  ResFinder  2.1  (17  February  2017) 
[20]  and  VirulenceFinder  1.6  (18  February  2016)  [21]  databases. 
De-novo  assembly  was  performed  in  CLC  Genomics  Workbench 
9  (CLC  Bio,  Aarhus,  Denmark)  with  de  Bruijn  graphs.  Sequence 
data  were  submitted  to  GenBank  and  are  registered  under  Bio- 
Project  accession  no.  PRJNA433074.  Based  on  the  draft  genome 
sequences, a core-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)- 
based maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree was constructed 
for all sequenced MSSA and MRSA isolates, with the genome of ST9 
LA-MRSA QDCD9 used as a reference. The tree was constructed us- 
ing Parsnp in the Harvest package [22] with default parameter set- 
tings, and visualized using iTOL [23] . 

2.5. Deﬁnitions and statistical analysis 

Human and porcine samples from a previous study located in 
12  rural  villages  neighbouring  the  production  chain  (slaughter- 

MRSA isolates were classiﬁed as human or pig associated based 
on the dominant origin of each ST/CC, while MSSA isolates were 

10 

C. Sun, B. Chen and A. Hulth et al. / International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents 54 (2019) 8–15 

classiﬁed  based  solely  on  their  origin.  Transmission  events  were 
deﬁned as isolates with core-genome SNP divergence of less than 
20 [24–26] . 

Descriptive and comparative analyses were performed in Graph- 
Pad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA), and statis- 
tical analyses were performed in SPSS 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, 
NY, USA). Differences in the total number of AMR genes, virulence 
genes and the number of resistance traits among human- and pig- 
associated isolates were assessed using the Wilcoxon test. Fisher’s 
exact test was used to test whether differences in frequencies of 
individual genes encoding resistance or virulence and drug resis- 
tance phenotypes were signiﬁcant. 

2.6. Ethical approval 

A signed consent form was obtained from all human partici- 
pants, and animal sampling was conducted in accordance with the 
principles of the Beijing Municipality Review of Welfare and Ethics 
of Laboratory Animals (BAOLA 2005). Ethical approval was given by 
the First Aﬃliated Hospital of Zhejiang University (2015#185 and 
2015#283). 

3. Results 

3.1. Prevalence of MRSA in the pork production chain and the 
community 

In total, 223 MRSA and 199 MSSA isolates were recovered from 
1983 samples collected from various sources and locations (Table 
S1, see online supplementary material), with all MRSA carrying the 

mecA  gene.  MRSA  isolates  were  detected  in  pigs  from  commer- 
cial farms (49%, 146/298), the slaughterhouse (fatteners, 8.2%, 7/85; 
carcass, 1.0%, 1/91) and pork meat (14%, 2/14) from the wholesale 
pork market ( Fig. 1 a). In Farm B, 80% (132/166) of pigs were posi- 
tive for MRSA, while on Farm A, 11% (14/132) of pigs were MRSA- 
positive (Table S1, see online supplementary material). Workers in 
the production chain also carried MRSA – farm workers (64%, 9/14; 
Farm A, 33%, 2/6; Farm B, 88%, 7/8), slaughterhouse workers (0%, 
0/16) and pork market sellers (0%, 0/3) – with an average nasal 
carriage of 27% (9/33). MRSA detection rate of residents from the 
surrounding community was 6.8% (4/59), and in rural villages, it 
was 1.7% (13/753) ( Fig. 1 b and Table S1, see online supplementary 
material) [11] . 

Environmental samples, eﬄuent, air and surface samples from 
the commercial farms were also MRSA-positive with average de- 
tection rates of 5.0% (7/140) and 36% (26/73) at Farms A and B, 
respectively. Most environmental samples from the slaughterhouse 
tested negative for both MRSA and MSSA, except for one MRSA- 
positive eﬄuent sample ( Fig. 1 c and Table S1, see online supple- 
mentary material). 

3.2. Population structure of MRSA and MSSA 

In  total,  51  spa  types  were  identiﬁed  among  the  422  S.  au- 
reus  isolates,  with  MSSA  isolates  (47  spa  types)  showing  greater 
diversity  than  MRSA  (four  spa  types)  ( Fig.  2 a  and  Table  S1,  see 
online supplementary material). Most MRSA isolates belonged to 
t899 (93%, 207/223), with the remaining MRSA isolates belonging 
to t437, t034 and t3527. MRSA spa type t899, t437 and t034, but 
not t3527, were also detected among MSSA isolates ( Fig. 2 a).

MRSA isolates of human origin were predominantly t899 (54%, 
14/26)  and  t437  (39%,  10/26)  ( Fig.  2 b),  while  the  clear  major- 
ity  of  porcine  MRSA  isolates  were  t899  (98%,  159/162)  ( Fig.  2 c). 
Of  the  MSSA  isolates,  the  top  four  spa  types  corresponded  to 
59% (117/199) of all MSSA isolates: t034 (35%, 70/199), t899 (13%, 
25/199), t458 (6.0%, 12/199) and t002 (5.0%, 10/199). The 87 human 
MSSA isolates belonged to 41 different spa types ( Fig. 2 b), while 
the 99 porcine MSSA isolates belonged to 12 spa types ( Fig. 2 c). 

In  total,  128  isolates  – 92  MRSA  belonging  to  four  spa  types 
and  36  MSSA  belonging  to  eight  spa  types  – were  subjected  to 
WGS (Fig. S2a and Table S2, see online supplementary material). 
Most  MRSA  isolates  belonged  to  ST3597-t899  (62%,  57/92),  fol- 
lowed  by  ST9-t899  (20%,  18/92)  and  ST59-t437/t034/t3527  (16%, 
15/92), with one t437 isolate identiﬁed as ST398. Most MSSA iso- 
lates were ST398 (53%, 19/36), followed by ST9 (22%, 8/36), ST188 
(14%, 5/36), ST59 (2.8% 1/36) and ST3597 (2.8% 1/36). Three isolates 
belonged to new sequence types: one MRSA isolate, a single locus 
variant of ST3597; and two MSSA isolates, single locus variants of 
ST9 and ST59, respectively. These were assigned as ST5051, ST5052 
and ST5053, respectively. 

MRSA ST3597-t899 isolates were frequently identiﬁed in sam- 
ples collected from commercial farms, including isolates from pigs 
(98%, 4 8/4 9) and workers (78%, 7/9), while ST9-t899 isolates were 
predominantly obtained from rural backyard pigs (86%, 6/7) and 
the slaughterhouse (57%, 4/7). In contrast, ST59-t437 isolates were 
primarily  found  in  samples  from  humans  in  rural  villages  (47%, 
7/15)  and  in  the  community  surrounding  the  production  chain 
(27%, 4/15). MSSA isolates from commercial farms, the slaughter- 
house, the pork wholesale market and the rural villages were pre- 
dominantly of the same MLST type, ST398, but representing a dis- 
tinct set of spa types (Table S2, see online supplementary material). 
Core-genome-based ML phylogenetic analysis of the 92 MRSA 
and the 36 MSSA isolates identiﬁed four groups, corresponding to 
sequence types identiﬁed as CC9, ST188, ST59 and ST398 ( Fig. 3 ). 
SNP divergence among various isolates was calculated from a total 
of 31 564 core-genome SNPs. 

All  MRSA  and  MSSA  isolates  from  the  surrounding  commu- 
nity  were  phylogenetically  separated  from  those  in  the  produc- 
tion  chain.  However,  indication  of  MRSA  transmission  along  the 
production chain was observed. For example, ST3597-t899 MRSA 

isolate 2AY27 recovered on Farm A was closely related to DY67- 
1 recovered from the slaughterhouse (19 SNPs difference). Further, 
within the commercial farms, an overlap of LA-MRSA was observed 
between  pigs,  farm  workers,  the  environment,  and  between  the 
two farms. For example, ST3507-t899 MRSA AB4 recovered from 
a worker on Farm A was closely related to BY2 of porcine origin 
on Farm A (one SNP difference). This was also observed on Farm 
B, as ST3597-t899 MRSA 2AB6-1 (farm worker) and BY78 (weaner) 
were closely related (one SNP difference). Also, on Farm B, ST3597- 
t899 MRSA isolates 2AY7-1, 2AY20, 2AY36, 2AY41 and 2AY47 re- 
covered from sows were closely related to isolates recovered from 
weaners (BY53, BY56-1, BY80, BY69 and BY68) (zero to four SNPs 
difference), and ST3597-t899 MRSA isolates BY54 and BY74 recov- 
ered from weaners were closely related to isolates recovered from 
growers (2CY8 and 2CY4) (zero to two SNPs difference). Further, 
ST3597-t899 MRSA isolate 2BA2-1 recovered from an air sample 
on Farm B was closely related to the porcine isolate BY48-1 (one 
SNP difference) of the same farm. In addition, ST3597-t899 MRSA 
isolate BY7 recovered from a weaner on Farm A was identical to 
isolates recovered from sows (2AY7-1 and 2AY20) on Farm B (zero 
SNP divergence) ( Fig. 3 ). 

Within the backyard farms, MRSA from humans at two house- 
holds  in  the  rural  villages  (AK046,  ST59-t437;  AH022,  ST9-t899) 
were closely related to those from pigs within the same house- 
hold (YK046, ST59-t437; YH022, ST9-t899) (10–12 SNPs difference). 
Potential  MSSA  overlaps  were  also  detected  between  individual 
humans  within  the  same  village,  such  as  isolates  AD057  (ST59- 
t437) and AD016 (ST59-t437) from Village D (zero SNP difference), 
S1AH011 (ST9-t899) and S1AH053 (ST9-t899) from Village H (zero 
SNP difference) ( Fig. 3 ). 

3.3. Distribution of AMR and virulence genes in MRSA and MSSA 

In total, 23 AMR genes and 24 virulence genes were detected 
among  the  isolates  ( Fig.  4 a  and  b).  Acquired  AMR  genes  were 
widespread in isolates of both human and porcine origin. Except 
for the widely distributed resistance genes in this collection, such 
as blaZ and norA , the distribution of individual AMR genes varied 
among isolates of human- and pig-associated groups. Among the 
MRSA isolates, acquired AMR genes were more frequently detected

4. Discussion 

To the authors’ knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study in China to as- 
sess the epidemiology and transmission of S. aureus in a pork pro- 
duction chain, operation workers, the environment and surround- 
ing community. Along the pork production chain, MRSA-CC9 was 
detected from commercial farms, the slaughterhouse and the pork 
wholesale market, but the occurrence of MRSA decreased along the 
chain.  The  results  indicate  that  MRSA-CC9  can  spread  along  the 

pork production chain, but that the potential spread between com- 
mercial farms and the surrounding community and villages is lim- 
ited as no closely related MRSA-CC9 were identiﬁed in the commu- 
nity or villages. The MRSA identiﬁed in humans in the surrounding 
community and villages belonged instead to ST59-t437, which is a 
common community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) strain in China 
[27] . The high MRSA carriage among farm workers (64%) combined 
with a lack of MRSA-CC9 isolates in the community is in accor- 
dance with an earlier Chinese study which showed that the general 
population without livestock contact are less likely to carry MRSA- 
CC9 [28] . The high occurrence in pig production is still of concern 
because increased incidence of LA-MRSA-CC398 has been observed 
among humans without livestock contact in Europe [1–3] . 

A large difference in the prevalence of MRSA among pigs of the 
two investigated farms, 80% (Farm B) and 11% (Farm A), was ob- 
served, potentially connected to the larger size of Farm B [29] . This 
observation was not surprising as a previous study in Shandong 
Province described great variations in MRSA-positive pigs between 
different farms: 0–45% [8] . Other Chinese studies have also shown 
that the occurrence of MRSA differs geographically, with estimates 
ranging from 3.6% (Ningxia) to 47% (Shanghai) [6,8,30] . 

Most MRSA isolates retrieved from the production chain were 
ST3597-t899,  a  single  locus  variant  of  ST9.  ST3597  were  widely 
distributed in the two commercial farms among pigs, farm work- 
ers and environmental samples, and occurred sporadically at the 
slaughterhouse  (Fig.  S2b,  see  online  supplementary  material).  In 
contrast, the MRSA-positive backyard pigs in the same area all car- 
ried ST9-t899 [11] . Furthermore, all ST3597 isolates were closely 
related and were phylogenetically separated from ST9 isolates (Fig. 
S2b, see online supplementary material). These results indicate a 
recent clonal expansion of ST3597 in Farms A and B, rather than 
multiple introductions into these farms. To the authors’ knowledge, 

14 

C. Sun, B. Chen and A. Hulth et al. / International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents 54 (2019) 8–15 

this is the ﬁrst description of this speciﬁc CC9 variant in Chinese 
pig farms, although there is a previous report of another ST9 single 
locus variant, ST1376, from one pig farm [7] . 

(SCHW382/11-1),  Shandong  Provincial  Natural  Science  Founda- 
tion  (BS2014SW020),  and  China  Postdoctoral  Science  Foundation 
(2018M640206). 

In contrast to the MRSA situation, ST398 was the most frequent 
porcine and human MSSA sequence type identiﬁed in the current 
study.  In  China,  ST398  is  primarily  associated  with  community- 
and hospital-acquired MSSA infections in humans [27,31] . Similar 
to a previous ﬁnding [32] , four of seven ST398-MSSA isolated from 
humans carried genes related to the immune evasion gene cluster 
(IEC), while none of the 12 isolates from pigs carried these genes 
(Table S2, see online supplementary material). This indicates that 
two different ST398 populations are circulating in the area, one in 
humans and another in pigs. Furthermore, one ST398-MRSA isolate 
(DY77) was identiﬁed in fatteners from the slaughterhouse in the 
current study. Interestingly, this ST398-MRSA belonged to spa type 
t437,  which  was  associated  with  ST59  in  this  and  other  studies 
[11,33] . Although MRSA-ST398 is uncommon in pigs in China, there 
is one recent report of MRSA-ST398 from a pig farm in Southern 
China, but the respective isolates belonged to spa types t034 and 
t571 [34] . 

The occurrence of resistance genes in MRSA and MSSA porcine 
isolates  was  generally  higher  than  that  in  the  isolates  from  hu- 
mans. The resistance phenotypes also differed between isolates of 
human-  and  pig-associated  groups  (e.g.  resistance  to  ﬂorfenicol, 
gentamicin, tetracycline, tiamulin and ciproﬂoxacin), and there was 
concordance between AMR genotypes and phenotypes for most of 
the isolates. The differences in AMR between human and porcine 
isolates could be due to differences in antimicrobial use. Interest- 
ingly,  the  tetracycline  resistance  gene  tet (L)  was  associated  with 
pig-associated MRSA isolates (99% of isolates), while both human- 
and  pig-associated  MRSA  were  negative  for  tet (M),  which  is  a 
well-known genetic marker for livestock-associated S. aureus CC398 
[32,35] . The occurrence of tet (L), erm (B), together with the lack of 
IEC genes ( sak and scn ) in MRSA-CC9,  may function similarly as 
markers  for  LA-MRSA  in  China.  In  addition,  CC9-MRSA  was  also 
characterized by its high occurrence of staphylococcal enterotoxin 
coding genes ( seg, sei, sem, sen, seo and seu ) which are due to the 
enterotoxin  gene  cluster  egc  [36] .  However,  additional  studies  in 
CC9  from  both  human  and  animal  populations  are  necessary  to 
validate the markers observed in this study. 

This  study  provides  a  comprehensive  molecular  epidemiology 
portrait  of  MRSA  and  MSSA  along  a  typical  Chinese  commercial 
pork  production  chain  and  the  potential  overlap  with  the  sur- 
rounding population. The WGS-based approach conﬁrmed dissem- 
ination of CC9 between pigs, farm workers and the environment 
within the commercial farms, between pigs in commercial farms 
and  the  slaughterhouse,  and  between  pigs  and  humans  within 
households, while it did not reveal any indications that MRSA and 
MSSA from the production chain are circulating in the surrounding 
community. Instead, this study found two separate MRSA popula- 
tions in this region of China: one connected to pigs with mainly 
MRSA CC9 carrying tet (L) but lacking erm (B) and ICE genes, and 
one in humans with primarily MRSA ST59 carrying erm (B) and IEC 
genes  but  lacking  tet (L).  In  addition,  two  different  MSSA  ST398 
populations  are  circulating  in  humans  and  pigs  differing  in  IEC 
genes. To better understand the occurrence of LA-MRSA in pigs in 
China and to monitor its epidemiological changes, surveillance and 
further research studies in pigs, humans and their environment are 
needed.
