Abstract
The aim of this work was the genetic characterization of ce-
fotaxime-resistant  enterobacteria  from  animals  (53  sam-
ples), the surface water of rivers (17 samples), and wastewa-
ter  treatment  plants  (43  samples)  in  Tunisia.  A  total  of  48 
(42.4%) cefotaxime-resistant isolates were recovered. An ex-
tended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype with a 
positive double-disk synergy test (DDST) was exhibited by 34 
(70.8%) and 14 (29.1%) isolates from water and animal ori-
gins,  respectively.  Isolates  from  water  were  identified  as: 
Escherichia coli (n = 17), Hafnia spp. (n = 13), Citrobacter spp. 
(n = 1), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 1), Klebsiella pneumoniae  
(n = 1), and K. oxytoca (n = 1). Animal isolates were identified 
as: E. coli (n = 11), E. cloacae (n = 1), Hafnia spp. (n = 1), and  
K. pneumoniae (n = 1). PCR investigation of blaCTX-M, blaTEM, 
and  blaSHV  genes  showed  that  amongst  the  48  isolates  

with a positive DDST, 41 (87.5%) carried the blaCTX-M gene,  
1 isolate harbored the blaSHV gene, and 1 isolate coharbored 
blaCTX-M with blaSHV genes. The class 1 and 2 integrons were 
detected in 27 (56.2%) and 1 (2%) isolates, respectively. Our 
study  showed  a  significant  occurrence  of  ESBL-producing 
enterobacteria in animals and aquatic environments with a 
predominance of blaCTX-M genes.

Introduction

The treatment of infections caused by the opportunis-
tic or strict pathogenic enterobacteria is primarily based 
on the use of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and quino-
lones [Bush, 2015]. Enterobacteriaceae have acquired re-
sistance to most of the antibiotic classes that were previ-

B.H.  and  S.S.  contributed  equally  to  the  experimental  part  of  this 
work.

ously used in its treatment, mainly due to the abuse and 
misuse of antibiotics in different settings [Nhung et al., 
2016]. This fact has been amplified by some intensive an-
tibiotic use in animal husbandry to treat or prevent dis-
eases  or  as  growth  promoters.  These  practices  favored 
probabilistic  selection  and  expression  of  the  resistant 
stocks  of  bacteria  [Hernandez  and  González-Acuña, 
2016].

The major problem associated with Enterobacteriaceae 
is  the  resistance  to  extended-spectrum  cephalosporins 
(cephalosporins of the third and fourth generation, such 
as cefotaxime [CTX] and ceftazidime), generally due to 
the  production  of  extended  spectrum  beta-lactamase 
(ESBL) and plasmid-mediated cephalosporinase (pAmpC) 
[Biehl et al., 2016]. In addition, these strains are mainly 
multidrug resistant, being strongly associated with fluoro-
quinolone,  aminoglycosides,  and  trimethoprim-sulfa-
methoxazole resistance [Harada et al., 2016]. The ESBL or 
some pAmpC-producing strains are currently isolated in 
hospital settings, in animals and food products of plant 
and animal origin, as well as from water circles (lakes, riv-
ers, urban water runoff) [Ben Said et al., 2015].

The aim of this work was to isolate CTX-resistant en-
terobacteria collected from multiple nonclinical settings 
(wastewater, rivers, and animals) and to investigate the 
occurrence of class 1 and 2 integrons as well as genes en-
coding ESBL.

Results

Isolation and Phenotypic Identification of Strains of 
Enterobacteria
Amongst 60 samples of water from wastewater treat-
ment plant (WWTP) and rivers, 34 (56.7%) CTX-resis-
tant isolates were found. The isolates were identified as: 
Escherichia coli (17 isolates, 50%), Hafnia spp. (13 iso-
lates, 38.2%), Citrobacter spp. (1 isolate, 2.9%), Entero-
bacter cloacae (1 isolate, 2.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1 
isolate, 2.9%), and K. oxytoca (1 isolate, 2.9%).

From 53 samples of various animal origins, 14 (26.4%) 
CTX-resistant  isolates  were  detected  and  identified  as  
E. coli (11 isolates, 78.6%), E. cloacae (1 isolate, 7.1%), 
Hafnia spp. (1 isolate, 7.1%), and K. pneumoniae (1 iso-
late, 7.1%; Table 1).

Antibiotic Susceptibility
Among the 34 isolates recovered from WWTP and riv-
ers, 18 (85%) showed an ESBL phenotype by the double-
disk synergy test (DDST), and the remaining exhibited 

202

ESBL and AmpC (by confirmatory phenotypic testing) 
phenotypes. In contrast, all 14 isolates from animals were 
only ESBL producers. Imipenem and colistin resistance 
were not detected. In addition, most isolates were multi-
drug resistant (resistant to three or more antibiotic class-
es). Indeed, in addition to beta-lactams resistance, iso-
lates  were  mainly  coresistant  to  trimethoprim/sulfa-
methoxazole, sulfonamide, streptomycin, nalidixic acid, 
norfloxacin, and tetracycline. Thus, 33 isolates were clas-
sified as multidrug resistant independently of their ori-
gins (Table 1). 

Occurrences of blaCTX-M, blaSHV and blaTEM Genes
PCR  showed  that  42  (87.5%)  isolates  carried  the  
blaCTX-M gene; 1 of them coharbored the blaSHV gene. One 
isolate harbored only the blaSHV gene. The remaining 5 
isolates did not harbor any of the investigated genes (Ta-
ble 1).

Occurrences of Integrons
Amongst  the  48  isolates,  28  (58.3%)  were  integron-
positive amongst the isolates with a positive synergy test. 
Overall, the class 1 integron was detected in 27 isolates 
whereas the integron of class 2 was only detected in 1 iso-
late (Table 1).

Discussion

In this study, the analysis of the 60 different samples of 
waste and surface water revealed 34 (56.7%) CTX-resis-
tant Enterobacteriaceae isolates. E. coli and Hafnia spp. 
were the predominant species (50 and 38.2%, respective-
ly) followed by Citrobacter spp., E. cloacae, K. pneumoni-
ae, and K. oxytoca (each 1 isolate). Amongst them, 18 and 
16 isolates showed ESBL and ESBL/AmpC phenotypes, 
respectively.

From the 53 samples of animal origin, only 14 (26.4%) 
isolates were CTX resistant and showed a phenotypic trait 
of ESBL producers. Herein, E. coli was also the predomi-
nant species (78.6%, 11 isolates). The remaining 3 isolates 
were E. cloacae, Hafnia spp., and K. pneumoniae. These 
species have been increasingly reported as ESBL or AmpC 
producers independently of their origins, and E. coli re-
mains the most predominant species in many studies so 
far [Harris, 2015].

WWTPs are considered as genuine “hot spots” that pro-
mote the horizontal exchange of genetic elements due to 
significant bacterial numbers and the coexistence of bacte-
ria from different origins (human, animal, environment),

Predominance of blaCTX-M in  ESBL-Producing EnterobacteriaceaeJ Mol Microbiol Biotechnol 2018;28:201–206DOI: 10.1159/000495409in an environment rich in organic matter and in the pres-
ence of hundreds of antibiotic molecules or their metabo-
lites [Baquero et al., 2008]. The WWTP considered in this 
study is located in Tunis City, where municipal wastewater 
is treated, and therefore the occurrence of CTX-resistant 
isolates is highly predictive. Other works have also report-
ed a high prevalence of CTX-resistant enterobacterial pop-
ulations in WWTPs [Conte et al., 2017]. Beta-lactam-resis-
tant enterobacteria from animal origins (livestock, domes-
tic animals, wild animals) as well as in certain food products 
of animal origin (meat, eggs, and derivatives, etc.) have also 
been increasingly reported worldwide, especially in por-
cine and poultry husbandries [García-Cobos et al., 2015; 
Kilani et al., 2015; Tekiner and Özpınar, 2016].

Interestingly, we found five CTX-resistant E. coli iso-
lates from feces of healthy sheep; to the best of our knowl-
edge, this finding is uncommon in ovine E. coli either in 
Tunisia or worldwide [Ben Sallem et al., 2012; Pehlivano-
glu et al., 2016]. Similarly, one CTX-resistant E. coli was 
also recovered from bovine milk, a finding rarely report-
ed from commensal enterobacteria from bovine or food 
products of bovine origin [Skočková et al., 2015].

Over the last decade, CTX-M-type beta-lactamases en-
coded by blaCTX-M genes have become a rapidly growing 
type  of  ESBL  in  Enterobacteriaceae.  Interestingly,  this 
phenomenon has not been limited to enterobacteria in 
human clinical settings, but also from animals, vegeta-
bles, and aquatic environments [Ben Said et al., 2015]. 
Similarly, the majority of our isolates harbored enzymes 
of CTX-M type (42 isolates, 87.5%), whereas one isolate 
coharbored  both  blaCTX-M  and  blaSHV  genes.  Unfortu-
nately, owing to many financial limitations, we were un-
able  to  sequence  these  genes.  However,  it  is  worthy  of 
note that in Tunisia blaCTX-M-1 and blaCTX-M-15 are pre-
dominant in enterobacteria isolates, especially in E. coli, 
from animal and human origins, respectively [Chouchani 
et al., 2012; Kilani et al., 2015]. Therefore, it is likely that 
most  blaCTX-M  genes  found  in  our  isolates  might  be  of 
blaCTX-M-1 type. Further investigation is needed to con-
firm  this  hypothesis.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  
K. pneumoniae strain harboring only blaSHV genes was 
isolated  from  an  ornamental  bird  imported  from  the 
Netherlands. This blaSHV gene would probably encode a 
blaSHV-ESBL owing to the ESBL phenotype exhibited by 
this strain. This result could be related to a difference of 
the  epidemiological  dissemination  of  ESBL-encoding 
genes between Tunisia and the Netherlands, considering 
the  predominance  of  blaCTX-M genes  in  Tunisia  and  of 
blaSHV genes in the Netherlands [Al Naiemi et al., 2006; 
Kilani et al., 2015]. The ESBL producer isolates lacking

blaSHV, blaTEM, or blaCTX-M genes might carry other ESBL 
genes(s) not investigated in our studies, such as the SFO 
(Serratia fonticola), BES (Brazilian ESBLs), BEL (Belgium 
ESBLs),  TLA  (Tlahuicas;  Indian  tribe),  GES  (Guyana  
ESBLs),  PER  (Pseudomonas  extended  resistance)  and 
VEB (Vietnam ESBLs) types [Naas et al., 2008].

Sixteen strains of animal origin showed an AmpC phe-
notype associated with an ESBL phenotype, as has been 
reported  previously  [Reich  et  al.,  2013].  These  strains 
might harbor genes encoding plasmidic cephalosporinas-
es such as blaCMY or hyperproduction of chromosomal 
cephalosporinases [Corvec et al., 2007].

According  to  many  reports,  Enterobacteriaceae-pro-
ducing  ESBL  or  AmpC  are  mainly  multidrug  resistant 
[Muzslay et al., 2017]. Indeed, 33 out of the 48 (68.8%) 
CTX-resistant isolates were multidrug resistant. Coasso-
ciated  resistance  was  observed  for  quinolones,  tetracy-
cline, sulfonamides, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 
and similar results have been reported elsewhere [Blaak et 
al., 2015]. It is worthwhile noting that an exception oc-
curred for some isolates from water, where 4 (11.8%) iso-
lates were resistant only to beta-lactams antibiotics.

Genes encoding antibiotic resistance are mainly car-
ried by mobile genetic elements such as transposons and

easy dissemination within the same species or between 
different genera. Twenty-nine isolates of our strains con-
tained integrons, with integron of class 1 being the most 
predominant (28/29). This finding is similar to many re-
ports where drug-resistant bacteria mainly harbored class 
1  integrons  [Mehdipour  Moghaddam  et  al.,  2015].  In-
deed, gene cassettes encoding resistance to sulfonamides, 
trimethoprim, and aminoglycosides are mainly found as 
a part of class 1 integrons, which explains in part the re-
sistance to these antibiotics in our strains.

Experimental Procedures

Sampling and Bacteria Isolation
One hundred and thirteen samples were collected from mul-
tiple nonclinical settings from January 2014 to June 2014. Forty-
three samples of wastewater were collected from WWTPs located 
in the region of Sahel cities (Sousse City, Mahdia City, Sidi Bouali 
village, El Djem village, and Kssour el Essef village; south-east of 
Tunis City), and the great Tunis region (Charguia and El Menzeh; 
Table 2). These wastewater sites are sampled at various levels of 
processing. In addition, 17 samples of surface water were collected 
from some rivers or “Wadis” (“Wadi” or “Oued” is a generic term 
for a North African river and semi-desert region with a very ir-
regular hydrological regime), such as the Wadi Hammam Zriba 
(area of Zaghouan) and the Wadi Chafreau (Area of Ariana, zone 
of the Grand Tunis). Fifty-three samples of animal origin (feces, 
organs, and milk) were also analyzed (Table 2).

Five grams of feces or 2 mL of water were added to 5 mL of 
brain-heart infusion broth and incubated overnight at 37  ° C, and 
then 1 mL from each sample was inoculated on a MacConkey agar 
containing 2 µg/mL of CTX [Ben Sallem et al., 2012] for the isola-
tion of CTX-resistant enterobacteria, and incubated at 37  ° C for 
18–24 h. According to the form and the color of the colonies, one 
or several colonies were selected and re-isolated on the same selec-
tive medium to obtain pure cultures. Each colony was examined 
by Gram staining and the oxidase test, and later identified by the 
API system 20E test (Bio-Mérieux).

Antibiotic Susceptibility Study
Antibiotic susceptibility was carried out by the method of disk 
diffusion on Mueller-Hinton agar plates as recommended by the 

National  Committee  for  Clinical  Laboratory  Standards  [2012] 
guidelines. E. coli ATCC 25922 was used as a quality control for 
the antibiograms. The screening of ESBL producers was tested by 
the DDST. Isolates resistant to cefoxitin and amoxicillin/clavula-
nate  were  submitted  for  confirmatory  phenotypic  testing  for 
AmpC enzymes using cloxacillin (200 μg) as an inhibitor [Peter-
Getzlaff et al., 2011; Tan et al., 2009].
