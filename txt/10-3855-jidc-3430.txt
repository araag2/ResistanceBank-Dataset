Abstract 
Introduction: The main objective of the study was the molecular characterization of extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) in Escherichia 
coli isolates collected from human and bovine samples in Oyo state, Nigeria.  
Methodology:  Between  August  2010-2011,  114  E.  coli  isolates  were  collected  from  hospitals  (n  =  57)  and  bovine  (n  =  57).  PCR  and 
sequencing were used for identification of ESBLs, upstream sequences, plasmid-mediated quinolone  resistance (PMQR) genes and class 1 
integrons.  Plasmid  incompatibility  groups  were  identified  among  ESBL-positive  isolates  by  PCR.  Genetic  relatdness  was  assessed  by  rep-
PCR and MLST. Transfer of ESBL determinants to the recipient strain E. coli J53 was performed by broth mating assays. 
Results: CTX-M15 was the unique ESBL found in eight human isolates. Six CTX-M-15 producers also carry the aac(6’)-lb-cr gene and/or 
qnrB  gene,  and  class  1  integrons.  FIA,  FIB,  H11,  H12,  F,  Y  and  K  were  the  plasmid  replicon  types  found.  CTX-M-15  and  PMQR 
determinants were transferred by conjugation in two E. coli assigned by MLST to ST131 and ST2695, a new allele.  
Conclusions:  The  study  highlights  the  dissemination  hability  of  CTX-M-15  associated  with  PMQR,  and  the  presence  of  class  1  integrons, 
able to capture additional genes, justifying the urgent need of antimicrobial resistance surveillance in Nigeria.

Methodology 
Bacterial isolates 

Between August 2010 and August 2011, 57 E. coli 
isolates  were  collected  from  different  inpatients  from 
four  hospitals  located  in  Oyo  state,  Nigeria:  two 
tertiary  care  hospitals  (University  College  Hospital 
Ibadan and Bowen Teaching Hospital Ogbomoso), and 
two  secondary  hospitals  (Oluyoro  Catholic  Hospital 
Ibadan  and  General  Hospital  Adeoyo  Ibadan).  During 
the same period, 57  E. coli isolates were also isolated 
from fecal samples of different healthy bovine animals 
from  diverse  farms  at  slaughter  in  Oyo  state,  Nigeria. 

Extended-spectrum  β-lactamases 

(ESBLs)  are 
plasmid  borne,  and  are  harbored  by  Gram-negative 
bacteria. They can be divided into three major groups: 
TEM,  SHV,  and  CTX-M  types  [1].  ESBL-producing 
strains  can  increase  morbidity  and  mortality  rates,  in 
part  as  a  result  of  associated  resistance  to  other 
antibiotic  families,  which  limits  therapeutic  options 
and  raises  healthcare  costs  [2].  Plasmid-mediated 
quinolone  resistance  genes  (PMQRs)  have  been 
reported  to  be  associated  with  ESBLs  (and  other  β-
lactamases)  [3].  Many  reports  have  described  and 
characterized  ESBLs 
and 
Escherichia  coli,  including  reports  from  African 
countries 
the 
prevalence  of  ESBL  and  PMQR  determinants  in  both 
human  and  bovine  isolates  in  Nigeria  have  been 
documented.  A  recent  study  reported  high  rates  of 
resistance  to  quinolones  in  association  with  β-lactams 
among E. coli isolates from healthy animals in Nigeria 

[4,5].  However,

Susceptibility testing and phenotypic ESBL detection 

Susceptibility 

testing  for  12  antibiotics  was 
performed  using  the  Kirby-Bauer  method.  Results 
were 
interpreted  using  Clinical  Laboratory  and 
Standards  Institute  criteria  [7].  The  double  disk 
synergy  test  was  used  to  screen  the  production  of 
ESBLs in all isolates [8]. 

 

Identification of ESBL genes and upstream sequences, 
PMQR genes, and class 1 integrons 

PCR  was  used  to  screen  for  blaTEM,  blaCTX-M,  and 
blaSHV types of β-lactamases using specific primers [9] 
in  presumptive  ESBL  producers.  E  coli  39FFC 
(blaTEM),  E.  coli  144FFC  (blaCTX-M),  and  Klebsiella 
pneumoniae  339FFC  (blaSHV)  were  used  as  positive 
controls.  PCR  products  were  purified  with  Exosap  IT 
(Affymetrix,  Santa  Clara,  USA),  and  sequenced  in 
both  strands  (Macrogen,  Seoul,  Korea).  Nucleotide 
sequences  were  analyzed  with  BioEdit  software,  and 
database  searches  were  performed  using  the  National 
Center 
Information  website 
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).  

for  Biotechnology 

All  isolates  were  screened  by  multiplex  PCR  for 
the  most  common  qnr  genes:  qnrA,  qnrB,  and  qnrS 
[10].  Two  simplex  PCRs  were  carried  out  to  detect 
aac(6’)-lb  and  qepA  genes  [12-13].  Human  isolates 
positive for the  aac(6’)-lb gene were further analyzed 
by  digestion  with  a  BtsCI  enzyme  (New  England 
Biolabs  Ipswich,  USA)  to  identify  aac(6’)-lb-cr, 
which  lacks  the  BtsCI  restriction  site  present  in  the 
wild  type  gene  [11].  ISEcp,  Is26,  and  Is903  elements 
were investigated in the ESBL-positive isolates [9]. 

Integrase  gene,  intI1,  was  screened  by  PCR  in 
ESBL-positive and Qnr-positive isolates [12]. Isolates 
positive for intI1 were subjected to amplification with 
5´-CS  and  3´-CS  primers  [13]  to  amplify  the  variable 
region  of  class  1  integrons.  PCR  products  were 
purified and sequenced as previously described.  

 

Plasmid replicon typing 

Plasmid  incompatibility  groups  were  identified 
among positive ESBL isolates. The PCR-based Inc/rep 
typing  method  consists  of  five  multiplex-PCRs 
recognizing  three  different  replicon  types  and  three 
simplex PCRs for K, F, and B/O replicon types [14].  

 

Conjugation experiments 

The transfer of ESBL determinants to the recipient 
strain  E.  coli  J53  (sodium  azide  resistant)  was 

performed  by  broth  mating  assays,  at  a  bacterial  cell 
ratio of 1:10. Overnight cultures were centrifuged, the 
sediment  suspended  in  50  µL  of  PBS  buffer,  and  20 
µL  were  plated  in  duplicates  of  Luria-Bertani  agar 
containing  sodium  azide  (100  mg/L)  and  cefotaxime 
(1  mg/L).  The  antibiotic  susceptibility  profile  was 
determined  for  transconjugants  by  the  disk  diffusion 
method. PCR amplification of the ESBL determinants 
and  plasmid  replicon  types  was  also  performed  to 
confirm  the  transfer  of  resistance  determinants  and  to 
identify  the  plasmid  replicon  type  involved  in  the 
transfer  of 
the  methodology 
described.

Genetic relatedness and sequence typing by MLST 

The  rep-PCR  genomic  fingerprinting  method  was 
performed  on  the  ESBL  producers  to  assess  their 
genetic  relatedness  [15].  Multilocus  sequence  typing 
(MLST)  analysis  was  performed  [16]  on  the  two 
ESBL-positive  strains 
that  were  successful  on 
conjugation assays. 
 
Results 
Origin  of  bacterial  isolates,  antibiotic  susceptibility, 
and phenotypic detection of ESBLs 

Of  the  isolates  from  human  clinical  samples,  34 
were  from  urine,  10  were from  high  vaginal  swabs,  9 
were from stool, 3 were from suptum, and 1 was from 
an  endocervical  swab.  The  majority  of  the  human 
samples  (54%)  were  isolated  from  the  University 
College  Hospital  (UCH),  the  first  teaching hospital in 
Nigeria. Seventy-four percent of the bovine samples (n 
=  42)  were  obtained  from  farms  in  Ibadan,  which  is 
the  capital  city  of  Oyo  state  and  the  third-largest 
metropolitan area in Nigeria. 

Table  1  shows  the  susceptibility  profiles  obtained 
for  the  isolates.  As  shown,  the  bovine  isolates  were 
more susceptible to the antimicrobials tested than were 
the  human  isolates.  ESBLs  were  only  detected  in  the 
human  E.  coli  isolates.  ESBL-positive  strains  were 
also  resistant  to  gentamicin  (87.5%),  nalidixic  acid 
(62.5%),  and  ciprofloxacin  (50%),  but  susceptible  to 
cefoxitin and imipenem (100%). The ESBL-producing 
isolates  were  predominantly 
isolated  from  urine 
samples, followed by high vaginal swabs. 

 

Characterization of ESBL and PMQR 

Table 2 summarizes the molecular characterization 
of  ESBL  producers  and  a  bovine  isolate.  CTX-M-15 
enzyme was identified in eight human E. coli isolates, 
confirming  the  resistance  phenotype.  All  isolates  also 
carried  the  non-ESBL  blaTEM-1.  Two  and  six  E.  coli

blaCTX-M-15 producers showed the qnrB and aac(6’)-lb-
cr-variant  genes,  respectively.  Two  isolates  carried 
both  the  qnrB  and  aac  (6’)-lb-cr  genes.  A  single 
bovine  strain  carried  the  qnrS  gene.  ESBLs  and  other 
PMQRs were not found in the bovine isolates.  

An  ISEcp1  element  was  detected  upstream  of  the 
blaCTX-M-15 gene. The IS26 element was located in three 
of  the  ESBL  producers,  and  one  isolate  had  both  the 
IS26 and IS903 elements.  

Rep-PCR identified three DNA fingerprint patterns 
among  the  blaCTX-M-15 producers.  They  were  from  two 
hospitals in Oyo state; UCH had the highest number of 
isolates (n = 7). Most of the isolates shared a common 
fingerprinting pattern (data not shown). 

 

Plasmid identification  

Plasmids carrying the CTX-M-15 β-lactamase and 
the  PMQRs  determinants  were  assigned  to  the  FIA, 
FIB,  HI2,  F,  and  K  replicon  types  (Table  2).  In  the 
bovine strain, plasmids were assigned to the HII, FIB, 
and Y incompatibility groups.

The 
transconjugants showed resistance profiles identical to 
the  donors.  The  blaTEM-1,  blaCTX-M-15,  aac(6’)-lb-cr-
variant, and qnrB genes were confirmed to be present 
in  transconjugants.  The  transferred  plasmids  were 
assigned to the FIB and HI2 replicon types (Table 2). 
E. coli with conjugative plasmids belonged to different 
sequence  types;  H15,  carrying  aac(6’)-lb-cr,  blaTEM-1, 
and blaCTX-M-15, was identified as ST131, while E. coli 
H1,  harboring  qnrB,  aac(6’)-lb-cr-variant,  blaTEM-1, 
and blaCTX-M-15, was assigned to ST2695, a new allele.

The  intI1  gene  was  present  in  the  qnrS-borne 
bovine strain (no gene cassettes inserted in the variable 
region)  and  in  87.5%  of  the  human  ESBL-positive 
isolates.  Two  different  gene  cassette  arrays  were

disseminated  worldwide.  This  study  confirmed  the 
presence  of  CTX-M-15  in  human  clinical  isolates  in 
Nigeria,  though  at  a  moderate  prevalence.  A  strong 
association  between  ESBL  production  and  quinolone 
resistance  has  been  reported  in  Enterobacteriaceae 
[2].  In  this  study,  the  resistance  to  nalidixic  acid  and 
ciprofloxacin  shown  by  the  CTX-M-15  producers 
could  be  linked  partially  to  the  simultaneous  carriage 
of PMQRs. The aac(6’)-lb-cr-variant was shown to be 
prevalent;  qnrB  was  found  in  two  isolates.  Five 
different  plasmid  replicon  types  (H12,  FIA,  FIB,  F, 
and K) were identified, but only FIB, H12, and K were 
shown  to  conjugate.  Both  CTX-M-15  and  TEM-1 
determinants,  as  well  as  the  qnrB  and  aac(6’)-lb-cr-
variant,  could  be  transferred  (Table  2),  demonstrating 
the  potential  of  co-dissemination  by  horizontal  gene 
transfer  of  resistance  to  β-lactams  and  quinolones. 
Recently, a study reported high rates of resistance to β-
lactams and quinolones among Gram-negative isolates 
from  different  hospitals  in  Nigeria  [17],  which  may 
support  our 
level..

types,  as 
determined  by  MLST.  ST131  was  identified  as 
carrying  blaCTX-M-15 and  aac(6’)-lb-cr.  The  first  report 
recently  made  in  West  Africa  of  E.  coli  ST131 
harboring  blaCTX-M-15  and  aac(6’)-lb-cr 
found 
predominantly  among  hospital  isolates,  was  from 
Lagos,  Nigeria  [18].  Our  results  support 
the 
dissemination  of  this  strain  in  the  country,  since  they 
were collected in a different state. The other  blaCTX-M-
15 E. coli, harboring the qnrB and aac(6’)-lb-cr genes, 
was  assigned  to  ST2695,  a  new  allele,  not  previously 
reported to be associated with CTX-M-15. 

, 

 

The  IncF  plasmidic  family  was  the  most  common 
found  in  this  study;  it  includes  the  F1A  and  F1B 
groups frequently reported to be associated with CTX-
M  and  aac(6’)-lb-cr  resistance  genes  [14].  However, 
reports  about  the  association  of  the  qnrB  with  the 
plasmid replicon types found in this study are limited, 
as  are  reports  about  the  qnrS  association  with  HII, Y, 
and/or  FIB  plasmid  types  detected  in  bovine  isolates. 
The  lack  of  conjugative  transfer  of  the  CTX-M-15 
determinant  (and  PMQR  associated  genes)  may 
indicate that in the other E. coli isolates, the resistance 
determinants  were  encoded  on  non-conjugative 
plasmids. 

Class  1  integrons  coding  for  resistance  to  other 
antibiotic  families  were  also  associated  with  CTX-M-
15  producers,  though  their  genetic  location  was  not 
investigated.  However,  this  finding  shows  the  higher 
ability  of  the  strains  to  capture  additional  resistance 
genes.  

E.  coli  is  commonly  associated  with  urinary  tract 
infections, and the majority of CTX-M-15 strains were 
found  in  urine,  followed  by  high  vaginal  swab 
samples.  Samples  were  mainly  collected  at  the  UCH. 
This  may  be  due  to  the  fact  that  most  patients  in  this 
tertiary care hospital are referred from other hospitals, 
where they have been started on antibiotherapy. Also, 
in  developing  countries  like  Nigeria,  resources  are 
limited  and  antibiotics  are  indiscriminately  used  both 
in  humans  and  animals,  which  could  result 
in 
dissemination of ESBL producers.  

In  contrast  with  other  Nigerian  reports  [6,19,20], 
bovine  E.  coli  isolates  did  not  show  considerable 
resistance,  which  may  be  attributed  to  less  bovine 
antibiotic  dosing  in  this  geographic  location.  The 
predominant  resistance  rate  was  seen  for  tetracycline 
(44%), followed by trimethoprim (25%). Resistance to 
amoxicillin  was  detected  in  23%  of  the  strains, 
correlating with data obtained from reports on bacteria 

isolated from meat tables in  the geographical location 
where the study was conducted [20].  

the  high 

the  wide  use  of  ampicillin 

The  use  of  cephalosporins  and  fluoroquinolones 
for prophylaxis and treatment of bovine animals is rare 
in  Nigeria,  which  supports 
rates  of 
susceptibility  of  E.  coli  bovine  isolates.  However, 
these resistance determinants may be selected by other 
drugs frequently used in food animals. Chah et al. [19] 
reported 
in  poultry 
production  in  Nigeria,  which  may  provide  a  selective 
pressure favoring the emergence of E. coli strains that 
carry plasmids with TEM-1/2 and ESBL determinants. 
These  other  food  animals  may  serve  as  reservoirs  of 
ESBL-producing  E.  coli  strains 
that  could  be 
transferred to humans and other animals. However, in 
this study, we could not find an association between E. 
coli from human and bovine origins.

human  clinical  Nigerian  E.  coli  strains  carrying 
genetic mobile elements such as conjugative plasmids 
and  class  1  integrons  that  can  amplify  the  spread  of 
resistance  in  the  country,  reinforcing  the  crucial  need 
for antimicrobial surveillance in a country where over-
the-counter  antibiotic  sales  and  indiscriminate  use  of 
antibiotic are common.
