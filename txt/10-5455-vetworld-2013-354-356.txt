Abstract

Aim: The present study was undertaken to ascertain the prevalence and drug sensitivity pattern of causative agents of mastitis 
in and around Namakkal, Tamilnadu, India.
Materials and Methods: A total of 74 milk samples were collected and bacterial isolates from 72 samples were obtained and 
subjected to in-vitro chemotherapeutic sensitivity test.
Results: Out of 72 samples, 32 (44.44%) were found positive for Staphylococci species, 4 (5.5%) for Streptococci species, 30 
(41.66%) for E.coli and 6 (8.33%) for Klebsiella species. The drug sensitivity test performed irrespective of isolates, revealed 
sensitivity of organisms to various antibiotics and none of the isolates were found to be sensitive to penicillin G.
Conclusion: Enrofloxacin was found to be more effective antibiotic among all the tested antibiotics.

Introduction

development  of  resistance  to  antimicrobials.  The 
multiplicity of the cause and emergence of resistance 
due to indiscriminate and prolonged use of antibiotics 
in  absence  of  antibiogram  is  a  major  hurdle  in  the 
control of mastitis. 

To  overcome  this  problem  and  with  due 
consideration to the economic losses, the present study 
was  undertaken  to  ascertain  current  drug  sensitivity 
pattern of causative agents of mastitis.

Mastitis  is  the  inflammation  of  udder  tissue 
causing pathological changes in udder parenchyma and 
characterized  by  physical,  chemical  and  microbio-
logical  changes  in  milk  [1].  It  is  one  of  the 
economically  important  diseases  of  dairy  animals 
affecting quality and quantity of milk. Mastitis in dairy 
animals leads to economic losses in different forms viz. 
reduction in milk production (70%), premature culling 
(14%), veterinary expenses (9%) and milk discarded or  Materials and Methods

Resutls and Discussion

susceptibility test of bacterial isolates revealed the 
sensitivity in the descending order of Enrofloxacin 
(94.44%),  Ciprofloxacin  (91.66%),  Oxytetracycline 
(88.55%),  Amoxicillin  (80.55%),  Gentamicin 
(80.55%),  and  Streptomycin  (55.5%).  Enrofloxacin 
has  been  found  to  be  the  most  sensitive  (94.44%) 
among  the  battery  of  antibiotics  used  in  the  invitro 
study which was in accordance to some of the reports 
[16, 20-23]. Few reported [8,11,13,14,24] antibiotics 
other than enroflooxacin as most effective drug from 
the studies done in various parts of country contrary to 
the present findings. The studies [25-28] from different 
parts of Tamil Nadu reported the sensitivity of mastitis 
causative organisms to other antibiotics. Isolates in the 
present  study  showed  moderate  sensitivity  or 
resistance to Gentamicin, Streptomycin and Penicillin 
–  G.  Indiscriminate  and  frequent  use  of  these 
antibiotics  in  animals  could  be  the  reason  for  their 
ineffectiveness  against  bacterial  isolates.  A  similar 
observation  of  resistance  to  Penicillin  was  also 
observed [10,11,23,25,28,29].

Out of 74 samples of mastitic milk, 72 samples 
showed bacterial growth and two samples showed for 
yeast (Candida species) growth. Growth of yeast was 
confirmed  by  inoculating  the  milk  sample  in 
Sabourads-dextrose  agar.  Out  of  72  samples,  32 
(44.44%)  were  found  positive  for  Staphylococci 
species, 4 (5.5%) for Streptococci species, 30 (41.66%) 
for E.coli and 6 (8.33%) for Klebsiella species. The 
drug sensitivity test performed irrespective of isolates, 
revealed sensitivity of organisms to various antibiotics 
and none of the isolates were found to be sensitive to 
penicillin G (Table-1). The result of biochemical tests 
are given in Table-2. 

The present study revealed that Staphylococci sp.
