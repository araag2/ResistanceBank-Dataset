Enterobacteriaceae  were  isolated  from  tripe  purchased  from  five  butcher  shops  within  the  Mafikeng 
Municipality.  Samples  were  subjected  to  bacteriological  examination  using  standard  methods.  Mean 
counts (log10 cfu/g) obtained from bleached and unbleached tripe samples for aerobic plate counts (5.62 
and 7.00),  Enterobacteriaceae (4.09 and 4.61),  Pseudomonas (4.20 and  4.57), lactic acid bacteria (2.15 
and 2.35) and Micrococci/Staphylococci (3.82 and 5.61) were noted. Enterobacteriaceae on Violet  Red 
Bile  Agar  were  identified  as;  Enterobacter  spp.,  Escherichia  spp.,  Klebsiella  spp.,  Serratia  spp., 
Providencia stuartii (0.85%), Hafnia alvei (7.63%), Citrobacter spp., Salmonella arizonae (3.39%), Erwinia 
spp. (0.85%), Moellerella wisconsensis (3.39%), Pantoea spp. (0.85%), and Yersinia kristensii (0.85%). A 
large  percentage  of  Enterobacteriaceae  (98.48%)  strains  tested  against  nine  antibiotics  showed 
resistance to one or more. Some species from the genera Serratia, Enterobacter and Escherichia coli 
were resistant to seven out of the nine antibiotics. Highest resistance patterns were observed against 
nalidixic  acid  (96.4%)  and  ampicillin  (75%).  All  isolates  were  susceptible  to  gentamicin  and 
ciprofloxacin. Inadequate processing of bovine tripe sold at some butcher shops in Mafikeng poses a 
potential  health  risk  to  consumers  due  to  their  poor  bacteriological  quality  and  high  frequency  of 
antibiotic resistant agents. Resistant strains can be passed to the human population via consumption 
of such products. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Tripe  is  an  edible  offal  obtained  from  the  first  two 
chambers  of  a  cattle's  stomach:  the  rumen  and  the 
reticulum. It is a common and inexpensive product of high 
nutritional  value  with  a  distinguished  taste.  It  is  used  to 
prepare stew. Such stew is eaten with pap (maize meal). 
There are two common and distinct grades of bovine tripe 
sold  at  most  butcher  outlets  in  Mafikeng  in  the  North 
West Province of South Africa: bleached and unbleached 
tripe.  Each  of  these  products  corresponds  to  a  peculiar 
standard  of  sanitary  quality  that  is  based  mainly  on  the 
processing technique employed during preparation. Tripe 
production  generally  involves  four  main  steps  which 
include  disembowelment  in  which  the  stomach  of  a 
slaughtered  cow  is  excised  and  its  contents  emptied;

selected  portions  of  the  stomach  wall  are  washed  with 
water  and  may  be  treated  with  chemicals  (for  example, 
diactolate)  to  get  rid  of  the  odours  and  characteristic 
greenish  colour.  The  cleaned  stomach  is  then  scalded 
and  trimmed  into  several  tripe  pieces  which  are  rinsed 
and packaged (Bensink et al., 2002). During this deconta-
mination  process,  however,  prior  to  packaging,  the  tripe 
may  be held at temperatures that favour the growth  and 
multiplication  of  contaminating  bacteria.  The  growth  of 
such  undesired  organisms  which  may  include  spoilage 
and  pathogenic  bacteria  may  be  hazardous  to  con-
sumers.  Spoilage  organisms  are  well  known  to  reduce 
the shelf life of a food product causing it to lose its market 
value consequently causing economic loss to suppliers.  

The  Enterobacteriaceae  family  is  one  of  the  main 
bacterial groups implicated in the contamination of bovine 
tripe. Their presence in a food is an indication of improper 
hygienic  measures  during 
the  entire  sequence  of 
processing (Gill  and  Landers,  2004)  and  inappropriate 

 
 
 
 
food storage. Within this group are found a wide range of 
Gram-negative  bacilli  of  clinical  significance.  Many 
species  of  bacteria  which  are  frequently  encountered  in 
hospital  settings  are  found  in  this  family  and  prominent 
members include Shigella spp., Yersinia spp., Salmonella 
spp.  and  Escherichia  coli  (Kornacki  and  Johnson,  2001; 
Miranda  et  al.,  2008).  These  bacteria  are  causative 
agents of many food borne infections in humans and this 
includes  diarrhoeal  diseases,  urinary  tract  infections,  to 
more severe diseases such as respiratory tract infections 
and plague (Seral et al., 2002).

These organisms have a striking ability to grow in a food

et  al.,  2000) 
the 
organoleptic properties of meat and other food products. 
The  mode  of  action  of  these  enzymes  involves  rapid 
degradation  of  structural  components  in  a  food  with 
subsequent  production  of  foul  odours  generally  making 
the food unacceptable to the consumer and also reducing 
its marketing range (Brightwell et al., 2007). 

that  have  negative  effects  on 

The  development  of  antibiotic 

resistance  among 
bacteria  presents  a  serious  health  problem  as  resistant 
pathogens  can  be  transferred  to  the  human  population 
when food contaminated by such undesirable organisms 
is  consumed  (Schwarz  and  Chaslus-Dancla,  2001;  van 
den  Bogaard  and  Stobberingh,  2000).  The  treatment  of 
infections caused by drug resistant pathogenic bacteria is 
generally  difficult  and  much  more  expensive  especially 
amongst  the  elderly,  infants  and  immuno-comprised 
people (Holmberg et al., 1984). In South Africa and other 
developing countries, food-borne diseases cause psycho-
logical  suffering  and  loss  of  productivity.  This  problem 
could  be  further  aggravated  by  an  increasing  resistance 
to antibiotics in many Enterobacteriaceae spp. which may 
cause  infections  in  humans  upon  consumption  of  conta-
minated  food  leading  to  prolonged  illnesses  that  may 
ultimately  end  in  treatment  failure.  Moreover,  some 
members  of  the  Enterobacteriaceae  family  have  the 
potential to cause spoilage. This results in short shelf life 
of tripe and may cause economic loss to suppliers. 

The ruminant stomach is divided into four gastric com-
partments:  rumen,  reticulum,  omasum  and  abomasum. 
These  subdivisions  act  as 
fermentation  vessels 
particularly  for  the  degradation  of  cellulose  (Teixeira  et 
al.,  2009).  Microbiological  examination  has  been  used 
constantly  to  make  sure  that  beef  products  entering  the 
food chain do not contain bacteria that pose a health risk 
to the consumers. During the evisceration of the stomach 
of  a  slaughtered  cow,  bacterial  contamination  of  tripe, 
especially  by  enteric  bacteria  is  inescapable  through 
direct  contact  with  faecal  material.  Cross-contamination 
by  numerous  bacteria  species  may  also  happen  as  a 
result  of  improperly  washed  processing  equipment  and 
poor  personnel  hygiene.  A  number  of  important  bacteria

products  have  also  been  found  in  tripe.  These  include 
Pseudomonas,

and 
Clostridium  spp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella  and  many 
other members of the Enterobacteriaceae family (Bensink

A  biological  indicator  is  a  microorganism  or  group  of 
microorganisms  which  are  used  as  a  tool  during  food 
analysis  to  gain  insight  about  the  level  of  contamination 
that may arise as a result  processing and storage. They 
provide information about the safety of a product (Brown 
et  al.,  2000;  Ingham  et  al.,  2000;  Moore  and  Griffith, 
2002).  Researchers  have  often  considered  the  direct 
examination  of  food  products  for  pathogenic  bacteria  as 
impractical.  This 
the  amount  of 
pathogens  present  in  a  food  can  be  so  small  that  they 
may  not  be  detected.  This  problem  is  compounded  by 
sampling  errors  and 
time  period. 
However,  the  occurrence  of  indicator  bacteria  on  a  food 
product does not necessarily mean that the food certainly 
contains  pathogens  but  rather  it  indicates  the  possible 
presence of food poisoning bacteria.

The objectives of the present study were: (1) to assess 
the  microbiological  profile  of  fresh  beef  tripe  sold  in  five 
butcher  shops 
to 
characterize  isolates  of  Enterobacteriaceae  from  beef 
tripe and thereby identify them at genus and species level 
in  order 
to  ascertain  which  strains  are  potentially 
responsible  for  contamination  and  spoilage  of  tripe  and;

Enterobacteriaceae strains obtained. 
 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Sample collection and preparation  
 
Twenty  two  samples  of  bovine  tripe  were  purchased  from  each  of 
five  butcher  shops  in  Mafikeng,  South  Africa.  Each  establishment 
was visited on two occasions. Total number of samples consisted of 
eleven  samples  each  of  bleached  and  unbleached  tripe.  Each 
sample was placed in a separate sterile plastic bag and placed on 
ice  in  a  cooler  box  which  was  immediately  transported  to  the 
laboratory.  Upon  arrival  at  the  microbiology  laboratory,  samples 
were held at 5°C, examined and analyzed within 2 h from the time 
of purchase.  
 
 
Enumeration and isolation of bacteria 
 
25 g of each sample was weighed aseptically and placed in a sterile 
masticator  bag  and  homogenised  with  225  ml  of  buffered  peptone 
water  (Merck,  Darmstadt)  for  2  min  in  a  homogeniser  (T-18  basic 
ULTRA-TURRAX). Serial dilutions up to 10-9 were prepared using 9 
ml  aliquots  of  the  same  diluent.  Dilutions  were  done  with  an 
automatic  pipette  (100  to  200  ml).  The  aerobic  plate  count  was 
determined by spread plating 100 µl of the appropriate dilutions (10-
1  to  10-9)  onto  a  Plate  count  agar  (PCA).  Plates  were  incubated 
aerobically at 35°C for 48 to 72 h and plates containing between 30 
and 300 colonies were counted. Average counts were recorded as 
log10 colony forming unit (CFU) per gram.

The prevalence of Pseudomonas spp. was determined by spread 
the  appropriate  dilutions  unto 
plating  100  µl  portions  of 
Pseudomonas  agar  supplemented  with  cemetridine 
fucidine 
cephaloridine (CFC) incubated at 35°C for 48 h. Lactic acid bacteria 
(LAB)  were  enumerated  by  plating  100  µl  on  de  Man  Rogosa 
Sharpe  agar  (MRS)  overlaid  with  5  ml  of  the  same  medium  and 
incubated  anaerobically  at  30°C  for  72  h  and  Staphylococci  and 
Micrococci spp. on mannitol salt agar at 37°C for 72 h. Enumeration 
of  Enterobacteriacae  was  performed  by  spread  plating  100  µl 
portions  of  appropriate  dilutions  onto  Violet  Red  Bile  glucose  agar 
which was incubated at 37°C for 24 h.  
 
 
Characterization and identification of Enterobacteriaceae 
 
Typical  colonies  (pink  red  to  purple  with  yellow  zones)  were 
considered  as  Enterobacteriaceae  and  counted.  Counts  were 
expressed  as  log10  CFU/g.  Up  to  12  colonies  (red  to  purple  with 
yellow zones) on Violet Red Bile Agar with glucose (VRBG) plates 
were selected at random and streaked twice on nutrient agar plates 
which were  incubated at 35 to 37°C for 24 h in order to obtain pure 
cultures 
isolate  was 
characterized by testing for their Gram reaction and were examined 
for cellular morphology using a light microscope. Complementarily, 
motility, catalase, and oxidase test were performed to characterize 
the  colonies  at 
level.  Presumptive 
Enterobacteriaceae  isolates  were  then  identified  to  genus  and 
species  by 
Index  (API)  20E  System 
(Biomerieux, France). 
 
 
Antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) 
  
This  test  was  performed  by  using  the  disk  diffusion  method  on 
Mueller-Hinton  agar  plates.  A  lawn  of  the  diluted  bacteria  was 
spread  in  Muller  Hinton  plates  with  a  cotton  swab,  then  the 
antibiotic  disks  were  dispensed  into  each  plate  with  a  disk 
dispenser  and  the  plates  were  incubated  at  35°C  for  24  h.  After 
incubation,  zones  of  inhibition  around  each  disk  were  measured 
(mm)  and  recorded.  Isolates  were  classified  as  susceptible, 
intermediate  and  resistant  strains  according 
to  Clinical  and 
Laboratory Standards Institute’ Guidelines. Resistance of an isolate

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
The  stomach  of  a  cow  is  home  to  millions  of  microbes 
and  therefore  contamination  of  tripe  derived  from  the 
rumen and reticulum is difficult to avoid especially during 
the  evisceration  process  (Bensink  et  al.,  2002).  In  the 
present study, the microbiological profile of both bleached 
and  unbleached  tripe  sold  at  selected  butcher  shops  in 
Mafikeng  was  evaluated.  A  total  of  22  samples  of  tripe 
(bleached and unbleached) were collected and analyzed. 
This  study  was  undertaken  for  a  time  period  of  eight 
weeks,  during  the  summer.  Table  1  presents  the  counts 
for  the  Aerobic  Plate  Counts  (APC),  Enterococci  spp., 
Micrococcus/Staphylococcus  spp.,  lactic  acid  bacteria 
and Enterobacteriaceae in log CFU/g.  
 
 
Counts of the different bacterial groups 
 
The log means for the APC were high, 5.62 and 7.00 for 
bleached  and  unbleached  tripe,  respectively  (Table  1). 
This  difference  in  APC  between  both  grades  of  tripe 
could be due to the method of processing employed. The 
high APC particularly from unbleached tripe was possibly 
as  a  result  of 
inadequate  washing,  high  ambient 
temperature in Mafikeng to support bacterial growth  and 
possible handling contamination. 

Enterobacteriaceae mean counts ranges between were 
log10 4.09 and 4.61. These counts were  much  similar  to 

 
 
 
 
those  in  the  literature  (Crowley  et  al.,  2005)  on  the 
investigation  on  beef  products  from  retail  outlets  in  the 
Republic of Ireland. Crowley et al. (2005) obtained mean 
counts  in  a  range  of  2.20  to  4.64  log10  Cfu/g  which 
indicated inadequate processing, handling and storage of 
the products. Also, such high counts could be potentially 
responsible for the short shelf life of tripe. 

The  occurrence  of  Micrococcus  and  Staphylococcus 
was  found  at  3.82  for  the  bleached  and  5.61  for  the 
unbleached tripe. The presence of Staphylococci in such 
high numbers could be as a result of cross contamination 
particularly  poor  personal  hygiene  amongst  the  food 
handlers  during  slaughtering,  dressing  and  evisceration 
or recontamination of the finished product through flies. 

Lactic acid bacteria counts averaged 2.35 for bleached 
tripe  and  2.15  Cfu/g  for  unbleached  tripe.  The  average 
counts  for  LAB  found  on  tripe  samples  were  slightly 
higher than results obtained by Garcia  et al. (2000) who 
reported  counts  of  2  log  Cfu/g  in  spoiled  and  unspoiled 
ham. 

Finally,  the  mean  log  counts  of  Pseudomonas  were 
4.20  to  4.57.  The  isolation  of  Pseudomonas  spp.  is  of 
high  significance  because 
this  organism  plays  a 
substantial  role  as  a  pathogen  and  as  an  indicator  of 
meat  spoilage  (Buys,  2000).  Jeyasekaran  et  al.  (2006) 
isolated and identified these organisms as good spoilage 
indicators and this is primarily because they are capable 
of  growing  on  meat  stored  under  aerobic  conditions  at 
low temperatures (Buys, 2000). The numbers observed in 
this survey may be as a result of dirty processing equip-
ment and a lack of proper refrigeration at butcheries.

the  API  data  showed  values 

Generally,  bacterial  counts  on  unbleached  tripe  were 
significantly  higher  than  those  obtained  from  bleached 
tripe  samples.  This  indicated  that  the  bacteriological 
quality  of  tripe  depends  on  the  method  of  processing 
employed during production (Bensink et al., 2002).

(Adesiyun  et  al.,  2006;  Brightwell  et  al.,  2007;  Dromigny 
et  al.,  2003).  Besides,  E.  sakazakii,  K.  oxytoca  and 
Pseudomonas  have  been  isolated  from  soil  (Babalola  et 
isolates  used  o-nitrophenyl-b-galacto-
al.,  2004).  All

the  (cid:1)-galactosidase  enzyme.  Few  strains 
reduced 
nitrates,  whereas  all  the  species  produced  acid  from 
glucose. The fermentation patterns of all isolates together 
with percentages of occurrence of species of the genera 
Enterobacter,  Citrobacter,  Escherichia,  Klebsiella, 
Serratia  and  Salmonella  in  tripe  samples  was  of  great 
significance  due  to  their  spoilage  and  pathogenic  poten-
tials  (Brightwell  et  al.,  2007;  Ridell  and  Korkeala,  1997). 
Hafnia  alvei,  Enterobacter  amnigenus  and  Serratia 
liquefaciens have been reported to be capable of growth 
at  low  temperatures  and  have  been  shown  to  be  a 
potential  cause  of 
food  spoilage  and  opportunistic 
infections (Tallgren et al.,  1999; Tamagnini et al., 2008). 
Contamination of tripe by these organisms could  without 
question yield significant economical losses. 

K.  pneumoniae  and  K.  oxytoca  are  also  opportunistic 
pathogens  that  have  been  linked  over  the  years  as  the 
main cause of diseases in humans such as septicaemia, 
pneumonia,  urinary 
tissue 
infections (Cai et al., 2008; Kovtunovych et al., 2003). 

infections  and  soft 

tract 

E. sakazakii, E. cloacae and C. freundii are associated 
with illnesses such as necrotizing enterocolitis, diarrhoea, 
meningitis,  urinary  tract  infections,  intra-abdominal  and 
ophthalmic  infections  and  septicaemia  (Lai,  2001;  Van 
Acker et al., 2001; Yu et al., 2000).  

The  presence  of  these  bacteria  groups,  especially  E. 
coli,  indicated  contamination  with  faecal  material  and 
environmental pollution and these supported the findings 
of  Herrera  et  al.  (2006)  who  isolated  similar  organisms 
from fish and fish products.  
 
 
Antibiotic resistance levels 
 
Antibiotic resistance is a global problem and has always 
been  a  major  concern  for  bacterial  infections  in  clinical 
environments. Since drug resistance in zoonotic bacteria 
has  limited  treatment  options  against  bacterial  infections 
or diseases in humans, antibiotic resistance in food-borne 
pathogens  has  become  a  significant  health  issue.  The 
frequencies  of  resistance  of  87  Enterobacteriaceae 
strains  are  presented  in  Table  2.  As  shown  in  the  table, 
majority of the isolates were resistant to NA acid, 96.4% 
and AMP, 75%. All isolates were susceptible to GEN and 
CIP  whereas  SXT,  CHL  and  CXM  were  consistently  the 
most active agents against most of the isolates, 60.2, 86 
and  83.1%,  respectively.  The  resistance  frequencies 
presented  in  this  study  for  AMP  were  much  higher  than

The incidence of TET resistance was 41%. Tetracycline 
resistance  mainly  occurs  when  an  organism  acquires 
tetracycline  resistance  (Roberts,  1996)  determinants 
such  as  efflux  proteins  and  enzymatic  alterations. 
Resistance  to  SXT  (39.8%)  is  probably  as  a  result  of 
alterations  in  chromosomal  genes  (Huovinen  et  al., 
1985).  The  high  rate  of  resistance 
to  quinolones 
according to Charles (2006) is primarily caused by gene 
mutation  of 
target  enzymes.  Most  organisms  were 
resistant to at least three antibiotics but many E. coli and 
Serratia  spp.  showed  resistance  to  7  out  of  9  antibiotics 
tested  while  only 
isolates  were 
susceptible to all antibiotics (Table 3). 

five  Enterobacter 

Citrobacter spp. exhibited high rates of susceptibility to 
most  agents  except  for  TET,  CHL  and  SXT.  Among  E. 
coli isolates, 75% were susceptible to nalidixic acid, 25% 
to ampicillin and 58.3% to CTM, 83.4% to CHL, 66.7% to 
SXT and 91.7% to CXM. Only 28.6% of Hafnia spp. were 
sensitive to  AMP  while  42.9%  were  sensitive  to  CTM, 

85.7% to tetracycline, 71.4% to CHL, 85.7% to SXT and 
71.5% to CXM.   For Enterobacter  isolates,  the suscepti-
ble  percentages  of  the  the  six  agents  were  58.6,  37.9, 
41.4,  82.2,  72.4  and  41.4%,  respectively,  with  79.5% 
sensitivity  to  NA.  Klebsiella  spp.  were  more  sensitive  to 
NA  and  SXT  (86.3%)  than  any  other  isolate.  40%  was 
sensitive to AMP, 73.3% to CXM and only 26.7% to CTM.

Resistance to multiple antibiotics by Enterobacteriacae 
spp.  have  also  been  reported  by  other  researchers 
(Dromigny et al., 2003; Sarter et al., 2007) and according 
to Baquero et al. (1998), this may be primarily due to the 
ability of the bacteria to adapt and survive in a constantly 
changing  antibiotic  environment.  This  gives  rise  to  a 
phenomenon  called  selective  pressure.  It  is  well  known 
that  Gram-negative  bacteria  posses  efflux  pumps  which 
aid  them  to  resist  many  antibiotics  by  actively  pumping 
out  the  drug  from  the  cell  before  it  reaches  its  target 
(Okusu et al., 1996). 

The  successful  completion  of  this  task  will  aid  this 
research  toward  its  long-run  objective  which  is  intended 
to increase the body of scientific knowledge regarding the 

 
 
 
 
safety and quality of retail beef tripe. This information will 
help  expand  the  body  of  scientific  knowledge  regarding 
microbial  physiology,  which  may  inform  us  about  micro-
bial physiology as well as the biochemical characteristics 
of bacteria found in the Enterobacteriaceae family  which 
will  further  help  to  evaluate  possible  risks  involved  with 
the consumption of beef tripe. 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
The findings from this study show that the bacteriological 
quality of tripe varies and depends on the technique used 
in processing. Secondly, post process contamination may 
occur during evisceration of the stomach, or as a result of 
the  hygiene  conditions  in  the  butchery.  The  temperature 
and general conditions of storage play important roles in 
the  hygiene  conditions  in  the  butchery.  Bacteria  counts 
together with API data obtained, indicated relatively high 
levels  of  contamination  of  tripe  and  different  species  of 
pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae most of which have been 
described  to  cause  serious  infections  and  diseases  in 
humans. Furthermore, many isolates recovered from tripe 
samples  demonstrated  resistance  to  commonly  used 
antibiotics  with  some  being  resistant  to  7  out  of  the  9 
antibiotics tested.  All these information make bovine tripe 
a  concern  for  consumers,  suppliers  as  well  as  an  issue 
for public health especially if it is not properly cooked and 
consumed as resistant pathogens can be passed into the 
human population. For this reason, effective programs to 
prevent  contamination  and  growth  of  these  undesired 
organisms should be established  in the meat industry  to 
control the incidence of food contamination with resistant 
pathogens.  Lastly,  efforts  should  be  made  to  inform  the 
public  on  good  sanitary  practices  in  handling  tripe  and 
consumption of only properly tripe product.
