Abstract

Background and Aim: Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) has emerged as significant foodborne pathogens. 
Ruminants are the primary reservoir of the zoonotic STEC. In Bangladesh, previous studies reported the presence of STEC 
in  cattle,  goat,  and  sheep;  however,  there  is  little  information  about  STEC  carriage  by  buffaloes. This  study  aimed  to 
determine  the  occurrence  of  STEC  in  healthy  (absence  of  clinical  signs  and  symptoms)  buffaloes  on  smallholdings  in 
Bangladesh and to assess the antimicrobial resistance pattern of identified STEC isolates.
Materials  and  Methods:  A  total  of  100  rectal  swab  samples  were  obtained  from  randomly  selected  buffaloes  on  40 
smallholdings in Chittagong Division, Bangladesh. Samples were subjected to bacteriological screening to identify E. coli. 
All E. coli isolates were examined for the presence of the Shiga toxin-producing genes - Shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and Shiga toxin 
2 (stx2) using polymerase chain reaction. The antimicrobial susceptibility of identified STEC isolates was tested using the 
disk diffusion method.
Results: Results show that 71 fecal samples were positive for E. coli in bacteriological screening. The proportion of buffaloes 
harboring STEC isolates was 11% (11/100) (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.1-18.8], of which 7% (7/100) (95% CI 3.2-
13.9) and 4% (4/100) (95% CI 1.2-10.2) carried stx1 and stx2 genes, respectively. Antibiogram revealed that 91% (10/11), 
73%  (8/11),  55%  (6/11),  and  55%  (6/11)  STEC  isolates  were  resistant  to  tetracycline,  sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, 
erythromycin,  and  ampicillin,  respectively.  In  contrast,  91%  (10/11)  STEC  isolates  were  sensitive  to  ciprofloxacin, 
chloramphenicol, and gentamicin, whereas 73% (8/11) isolates were sensitive to ceftriaxone.
Conclusion: This study highlights, for the first time, a significant proportion of fecal samples from healthy buffaloes on 
smallholdings in Bangladesh harboring antimicrobial-resistant STEC. Transmission of antimicrobial-resistant STEC from 
buffaloes to humans could pose an added risk to public health in rural Bangladesh.

Introduction

Escherichia coli is primarily harmless gut flora 
in  warm-blooded  animals.  However,  some  E.  coli 
serotypes may cause foodborne illness in humans [1]. 
Among  the  toxigenic  serotypes,  Shiga  toxin-pro-
ducing  E.  coli  (STEC)  is  the  most  significant  one 
in  public  health  perspective. A  number  of  serotypes 
produce  Shiga  toxins,  and  these  include  enterohem-
orrhagic E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, enteroaggre-
gative E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, and entero-
invasive E. coli [2]. The primary virulence factor of 
STEC is called verotoxin, Shiga-like toxin, or Shiga 
toxin. There are two distinct types of Shiga toxins pro-
duced by STEC: Shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and Shiga toxin

2 (stx2) [3]. Shiga toxins cause the host cellular death 
by  suppressing  the  protein  synthesis  [4],  which,  in 
turn, manifested by mild gastroenteritis to life-threat-
ening hemolytic uremic syndrome in human.

STEC infection in human is primarily foodborne. 
The food product from the reservoir animals and water 
contaminated by their feces can pose the high risk of 
contamination  with  STEC  either  with  their  feces  or 
intestinal contents [5,6]. Meat products such as sau-
sage, minced meat, luncheon, and hamburger and also 
dairy  products  are  mainly  responsible  for  high-risk 
transmission  of  STEC.  Cattle  are  recognized  as  the 
natural reservoirs of STEC; however, other ruminants 
are also important [7].

Buffaloes,  as  a  reservoir  of  STEC,  have  been 
reported in many countries in Asia, Europe, and South 
America  [8-10].  In  Bangladesh,  the  occurrence  of 
antimicrobial-resistant STEC in healthy cattle, sheep, 
and  goat  on  smallholdings  has  been  described  pre-
viously  [11-13];  despite  38%  buffalo  sampled  after 
the  slaughter  in  an  urban  area  of  Bangladesh  found 
STEC  positive  [14],  buffaloes  on  smallholdings  in

of STEC.

The present study aimed to assess the presence 
and  the  antimicrobial  resistance  pattern  of  STEC  in 
healthy buffaloes on smallholdings in Bangladesh.
Materials and Methods

Ethical approval

Ethical  approval  for  the  study  was  granted  by 
the  Institutional  Animal  Ethics  Committee,  Faculty 
of  Veterinary  Medicine,  Chittagong  Veterinary  and 
Animal  Sciences  University,  Chittagong  4225, 
Bangladesh.
Study area

The study was conducted between July 2015 and 
June 2016, in the coastal area in Chittagong Division, 
Bangladesh.
Collection of samples

In total, 100 buffaloes on 40 smallholdings were 
sampled for the study. From each animal, fecal mate-
rials were collected by placing a sterile swab into rec-
to-anal junction. The collected swab then dipped into a 
tube (5 ml) containing buffered peptone water (Oxoid, 
UK). Sample tubes were placed in ice-box until they 
shipped  to  the  laboratory  at  the  Microbiology  and 
Veterinary  Public  Health  Department,  Chittagong 
Veterinary 
and  Animal  Sciences  University. 
Demographic data (age, sex, and health status) on the 
animals  sampled  were  also  recorded.  Sampled  ani-
mals were divided into six subclasses - adult (≥1 year) 
and calf (<1 year); male and female; animal with poor 
farm hygiene; and animals with good farm hygiene.
Isolation and identification of E. coli

For  enrichment,  samples  in  buffered  peptone 
water were incubated at 37° C for 24 h in an incubator. 
A loopful from each of the overnight bacterial broth 
was  then  inoculated  onto  MacConkey  agar  (Oxoid, 
UK) and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Pink-colored col-
onies on MacConkey agar were suspected as E. coli 
colonies.  Smears  from  the  suspected  colonies  were 
examined  microscopically  to  detect  Gram-negative 
rods  using  gram  staining  method.  Colonies  positive 
for Gram-negative rods were then streaked onto Eosin 
Methylene Blue (EMB) Agar (Oxoid, UK) and pre-
sumptively  identified  E.  coli  by  observing  charac-
teristic green colonies with metallic sheen. The pre-
sumptive  isolates  were  subcultured  into  tryptic  soy 
broth (TSB) at 37°C for 24 h. Then, TSB cultures for 
each  presumptive  isolate  were  preserved  by  adding 
15% glycerin and stored at −80°C for further use.

DNA extraction

Total  DNA  was  extracted  using  boiling 
method  [15].  Briefly,  a  loopful  of  overnight  E.  coli 
colonies from 5% bovine blood agar was transferred 
into the 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and mixed in 200 μl of 
deionized water. The mixture was vortexed and heated 
in boiling water for 5 min followed by centrifugation 
at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was collected 
as a DNA template and stored at −20°C until use.
Detection of Shiga toxin-producing genes

To  detect  the  Shiga  toxin-producing  genes  in 
E.  coli  isolates,  uniplex  polymerase  chain  reaction 
(PCR) was performed using specific primers for stx1 
and stx2 genes (Table-1) [16,17]. Each PCR reaction 
was run with a final volume of 50 μl containing 1 μl 
(each) primer (20 pmol), 1 μl of dNTPs, 0.2 μl Dream 
Taq  DNA  polymerase,  5  μl  of  20  mM  magnesium 
chloride, 40.8 μl molecular grade water, and 1 μl DNA 
template. PCR was performed using a Thermocycler 
(2720  Thermal  cycler,  Applied  Biosystems,  USA) 
with an initial DNA denaturation at 95°C for 3 min 
followed by 30-cycle amplification at 94°C for 30 s 
(denaturation), 58°C for 40 s (primer annealing), and 
72°C for 1 min (DNA synthesis). The PCR products 
were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel stained 
with  0.5  μg/ml  ethidium  bromide  (Sigma-Aldrich, 
USA). The sizes of PCR products in comparison with 
a  1  kb  ladder  (Thermo  Scientific  Fermentas)  were 
inspected using an ultraviolet transilluminator (BDA 
digital,  Biometra  GmbH,  Germany). A  STEC  strain 
isolated by Das Gupta et al. [11] was used as a posi-
tive control in gel electrophoresis.
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Antimicrobial susceptibility of the STEC isolates 
was investigated using the disk diffusion method [18]. 
Commercial discs for ten commonly used antimicro-
bial  agents  in  Bangladesh  were  used:  Amoxicillin 
(AML, 10 μg), ampicillin (AMP, 10 μg), ceftriaxone 
(CRO,  30  μg),  chloramphenicol  (CHL,  30  μg),  cip-
rofloxacin  (CIP,  5  μg),  doxycycline  (DOX,  30  μg), 
erythromycin  (E,  15  μg),  gentamicin  (CN,  10  μg), 
tetracycline (TE, 30 μg),  and trimethoprim/sulfame-
thoxazole  (SXT,  30  μg).  The  susceptibility  pattern 
was denoted as “resistant ” and “sensitive” based on 
inhibitory zone and comparing with the standard from 
the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [19].
Statistical analysis

All data were entered into a spreadsheet program 
(Excel  2007,  Microsoft  Corporation).  The  propor-
tion of animals carrying STEC with 95% confidence

Results

Cultural characteristics of E. coli

Of the 100 fecal samples cultured in this study, 
71 produced bright pink colonies on MacConkey agar 
plates  and  found  as  Gram-negative  rods  with  gram 
staining. All 71 suspected isolates produced character-
istic green colonies with the metallic sheen on EMB 
agar.
Proportion of animal carrying STEC

PCR results show that seven isolates were posi-
tive for the stx1 gene (Figure-1) and four for the stx2 
(Figure-2), and hence, the proportion of animal har-
boring E. coli carrying stx1 and stx2 genes was 7% 
(95% CI 3.2-14.0) and 4% (95% CI 1.2-10.2), respec-
tively. In total, 11% (95% CI 6.1-18.8) buffaloes were 
positive for STEC. The distribution of STEC in dif-
ferent  categories  of  buffaloes  sampled  is  presented 
in Table-2. Two calves and nine adult buffaloes were 
positive  for  STEC  (p=0.323).  The  isolation  rate  of 
STEC  from  buffaloes  with  poor  farm  hygiene  was 
significantly higher compared to buffaloes with good 
farm hygiene (Table-2).
Antimicrobial resistance pattern

Antimicrobial susceptibility test of 11 STEC iso-
lates shows that 91% of the STEC isolates were resis-
tant  to TE, 73% to SXT, 55% to E, 55% to AMP, 45% 
to AML, 45% to DOX, and 27% to CRO (Table-3). 
Results also show 91% of STEC isolates to be sensi-
tive  to CHL, 91% to CIP, and 91% to CN. Eight (73%) 
STEC  isolates  showed  multidrug  resistance  (MDR) 
as they were resistant to more than one antimicrobial 
agent. Results revealed seven different resistant pat-
terns among STEC isolates (Table-3).
Discussion

In the study area, the proportion of buffaloes car-
rying STEC was 11% (95% CI, 6.1-18.8%). Although 
the first report of STEC in slaughtered buffaloes dates 
back to 2008 [14], to the best of our knowledge based 
on  exhaustive  literature  searches,  there  are  no  other 
reports  from  Bangladesh  that  predate  our  detection 
of  the  STEC  in  healthy  buffaloes  in  Bangladesh. 
Previous studies in the same study area reported that 
2% of the Black Bengal goat [11] and 5.4% of cat-
tle  [12]  on  smallholding  were  positive  for  sorbitol 
non-fermenting STEC, which suggest that, compared 
to cattle and goat, buffaloes have a higher probabil-
ity of carrying STEC. This higher carriage of STEC 
in  buffaloes  in  Bangladesh  further  supported  by  the 
study is conducted on slaughtered animals [14]. Islam 
et al. [14] reported a higher prevalence (38%) in the 
buffaloes  sampled  after  slaughter.  This  variation  in 
STEC  carriage  could  be  attributed  to  the  status  of 
Veterinary World, EISSN: 2231-0916 

the animal sampled (live or dead) and contamination 
during the slaughtering process. In the present study, 
the proportion of buffaloes carrying STEC was higher 
than  the  ranges  reported  from  buffaloes  in  India 
(6.6%) [21], Italy (6.8%) [22] and Iran (7.2%) [23]. 
However, higher proportions of STEC carriage were 
reported  in  buffaloes  from  Brazil  (64%)  [9]  and 
Vietnam  (27%)  [24].  The  observation  of  this  study, 
together  with  the  finding  by  Islam  et  al.  [14],  indi-
cated that probably the carriage proportion of STEC is 
widespread among buffaloes in Bangladesh.

In this study, 71% of fecal samples were posi-
tive for E. coli. This result might be due to two rea-
sons: First, one possible reason is that some sampled 
animals  might  have  been  treated  with  antimicrobial 
before  we  collected  the  fecal  samples  from  those 
animals. Second, up to 10% of E. coli isolates have 
historically  been  reported  to  be  slow  or  non-lactose 
fermenting, which probably contribute to the outcome 
since we have considered only pink color colonies on 
MacConkey agar (lactose fermentation positive) and 
time was 24 h which might be not sufficient for the 
slow lactose-fermenting E. coli.

The distributions of Shiga toxin-producing genes 
in E. coli isolated in the present study indicated that 
the proportion of buffalo calves carrying STEC was 
lower than adult animals; however, the probability of 
carriage of STEC between calves and adult buffaloes 
did  not  differ  significantly.  This  distribution  STEC

by age is corroborated by the previous investigation 
on goats [11] in the study area. This study recorded a 
significant difference (p=0.003) for the proportion of 
carriage of STEC in buffaloes with poor farm hygiene 
compared to buffaloes with good farm hygiene. This 
result of the present study implies good farm hygiene 
probably  leading  to  the  reduction  of  STEC  carriage 
in animals [25]. We did not perform any risk factors 
analysis.  Additional  epidemiological  investigations 
are required to identify the risk factors and their asso-
ciation with STEC carriage in animals.

Antimicrobial  resistance  profile  of  STEC  can 
be  a  valuable  indicator  for  assessing  the  status  of 
emerging MDR STEC strains since we observed high 
MDR  in  STEC  isolated  from  healthy  buffaloes.  We 
observed the highest antimicrobial resistance against 
TE (91% [10/11]) followed by SXT (73% [8/11]). This 
resistance profile is supported by the previous study 
on the caprine STEC isolated from the study area [26]. 
More  than  half  of  the  STEC  isolates  (6/11)  showed 
resistance  against  E  and  AMP.  Johura  et  al.  [27] 
reported a higher resistance against E (87%) in STEC 
isolated from livestock species in Bangladesh. A sub-
stantial proportion of STEC (73% [8/11]) isolated in 
the present study was resistant to more than one antimi-
crobial agent. The occurrence of MDR STEC in live-
stock species is corroborated by other studies [26,27]. 
Veterinary World, EISSN: 2231-0916 

These observations from the present study reflect the 
widespread and prolonged use of both antibiotics for 
the  treatment  of  infectious  diseases  and  in  animal 
feeds as a growth promoter. Interestingly, 91% (10/11) 
STEC isolates were sensitive to CHL, CIP, and CN. 
This observation agrees with the study of Hamed et al. 
[28] who reported that CHL, CIP, and CN were sen-
sitive to all STEC isolated from some food products 
and human stool in Egypt. These observations suggest 
CHL, CIP, and CN probably the choice of antibiotics in 
the control of STEC infection in animals and human; 
however, more clinical trials are required.
Conclusion

This study is the first to confirm the occurrence 
of  E.  coli  carrying  Shiga  toxin-producing  genes  in 
healthy  buffaloes  on  smallholdings  in  Bangladesh. 
The proportion of buffaloes carrying STEC was about 
11%.  The  high  frequency  of  antimicrobial-resistant 
STEC found in buffaloes, together with other livestock 
species,  probably  poses  added  challenges  to  STEC 
infection control at the source in Bangladesh. Effort 
should be focused on the detection of resistance genes 
in STEC from animal and human cases to establish an 
effective MDR STEC surveillance in Bangladesh.
