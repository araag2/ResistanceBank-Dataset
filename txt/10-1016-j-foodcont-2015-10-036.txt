The present study analyzed the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella along an integrated
broiler chicken supply chain. A total of 172 Salmonella isolates were recovered from 1148 samples
collected from four sample sources (breeder farms, broiler farms, abattoir, and retail markets), repre-
senting nine production stages. These Salmonella isolates were examined for antimicrobial susceptibility
to 12 different antimicrobial agents using a disk diffusion assay. Among them, 168 were identiÔ¨Åed as six
different serotypes of Salmonella enterica. The predominant serotype was S. Enteritidis (n ¬º 116), fol-
lowed by S. Infantis (n ¬º 18), S. Gueuletapee (n ¬º 16), S. Derby (n ¬º 12), S. Meleagridis (n ¬º 4), and S.
London (n ¬º 2). The remaining four isolates were serogroup-untypeable. A majority of the 172 isolates
(96.51%) was resistant to one or more antibiotics and 61.05% of the Salmonella isolates showed a
multidrug resistance phenotype. Statistical analysis indicated the one risk product stage for Salmonella
contamination occurred in the sample source at the abattoir, speciÔ¨Åcally the stage of Carcasses after
chilling. The majority of S. Enteritidis isolates shared the same pulsed-Ô¨Åeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
cluster, suggesting that the S. Enteritidis strain might spread along the broiler chicken supply chain. The
prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella in different production stages suggest the
importance of controlling Salmonella in the broiler chicken supply chain for public health, underlying the
need for improved measures of reducing carcass contamination in abattoirs and the appropriate use of
antimicrobials in broiler Ô¨Çocks.

1. Introduction

Salmonellosis, caused by Salmonella enterica, is one of the most
frequently reported foodborne illnesses worldwide (Scallan et al.,
2011; Shao, Shi, Wei, & Ma, 2011). Oral transmission is one of the

most common routes of Salmonella infection; humans are infected
through the ingestion of contaminated animal-derived food, indi-
cating that Salmonella from animals can be transmitted to humans
via the food chain (Fearnley, Raupach, Lagala, & Cameron, 2011).

The increase of antibiotic resistance in Salmonella has become a
worldwide problem in recent decades (White, Zhao, Simjee,
Wagner, & McDermott, 2002).
Food contamination with
multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria poses a major threat to public
health, as there is an abundance of evidence showing that
antibiotic-resistant bacteria of animal origin can be transmitted to
humans (Khemtong & Chuanchuen, 2008).

Chicken is one of the most widely consumed animal meats in
the world; however, it is also recognized as an important reservoir
of Salmonella (Adu-GyamÔ¨Å, Torgby-Tetteh, & Appiah, 2012; Thai &

M. Cui et al. / Food Control 62 (2016) 270e276

271

Yamaguchi, 2012). In addition, previous research has indicated the
importance of considering slaughter and other stages in the meat
supply chain for preventing Salmonella contamination (Arguello,
Alvarez-Ordonez, Carvajal, Rubio, & Prieto, 2013; Marin, Balasch,
Vega, & Lainez, 2011; Schmidt et al., 2012). During the various
stages of chicken slaughter and processing, all potentially edible
tissues are at risk of contamination from sources both within and
outside the animal, including the environment, equipment, and
operators. Thus, due to the high consumption of chicken meat and
increased occurrence and invasiveness of MDR Salmonella, the
prevalence and antibacterial resistance of Salmonella spp. in the
broiler chicken supply chain need to be monitored.

In order

to collect

information on Salmonella

cross-
contamination along the broiler chicken supply chain in Qingdao
City, China, the prevalence of Salmonella spp. in nine distinct stages
of the chicken supply chain and antimicrobial resistance were
investigated. Pulsed-Ô¨Åeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was per-
formed to study genetic relatedness of the dominant serotype S.
Enteritidis isolates from different production stages. The study
describes the characteristics of Salmonella in the broiler chicken
supply chain, which contributes to the understanding of antimi-
crobial resistance in this supply chain and may aid the creation of
strategies to prevent Salmonella contamination.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sample collection

and cleaning, Carcasses after chilling, Segmented chicken: leg or
breast Ô¨Ållet of butchered carcass, and Retail chicken: whole carcass
packaged and sold to consumers, purchased the same day or day
after delivery to the market.

One sample was collected from each animal or meat product as
appropriate. At farms, rectal swabs were collected from randomly
selected individual animals at three of the stages (Breeder, 5-day-
old broiler, and 20-day-old broiler). Broiler cecal samples, repre-
senting samples of the Adult broiler stage, were collected from
random animals at the abattoir. We chose the swab sampling
method because previous reference noted that whole-carcass
sampling by swabbing is necessary for optimum Salmonella re-
covery (McEvoy, Nde, Sherwood, & Logue, 2005). Additionally,
Salmonella contamination at abbatoirs often occurs on the surface
of the carcass. We used large swabs moistened with buffered
peptone water and swabbed the entire surface of the carcass.
Whole carcasses or meat from the next four stages (Pre-cleaning
carcasses, Post-cleaning carcasses, Carcasses after chilling, and
Segmented chicken) were sampled in the chicken processing chain,
using cotton swabs across the surface of the meat. Carcasses from
the Retail chicken stage were collected from three markets, and
were swabbed in the same manner. Sampling was timed to follow
folks through rearing and processing, and sampling on farms
included numerous locations to ensure a representative sample. All
samples obtained were immediately transported to the laboratory
in an insulated ice chest containing ice packs. Microbial analysis
was performed immediately upon arrival at the laboratory.

A total of 1148 samples (detailed in Table 1) were collected
during August and September, 2013, from a vertically-integrated
commercial broiler chicken supply chain in Qingdao City, China,
in which more than 90,000,000 broiler chickens are reared,
slaughtered, and sold per year. In this study, we selected related
breeder and broiler farms that constitute a vertically integrated
broiler supply chain; all animals were part of the same cohort
through this chain. Samples were collected from four types of
sources (three breeder farms (approximately 8000 birds/Ô¨Çock), two
broiler farms (approximately 15,000 birds/Ô¨Çock), one abattoir, and
three retail markets), including nine production stages (Breeder, 5-
day-old broiler, 20-day-old broiler, Adult broiler: 45 days old,
sampled after slaughter but prior to evisceration, Pre-cleaning
carcasses: carcasses sampled after evisceration but prior to clean-
ing, Post-cleaning carcasses: carcasses sampled after evisceration

2.2.

Isolation and serotyping of Salmonella

Pre-enrichment of the sample for Salmonella was performed
according to a method described previously (Li et al., 2013), with
modiÔ¨Åcations. BrieÔ¨Çy, cotton swab samples or 5 g of fecal matter
were placed into sterile 5 mL plastic tubes containing 2 mL of
buffered peptone water and incubated at 37 C for 6e12 h. A 0.2-mL
aliquot of these pre-enriched cultures were then inoculated into
2 mL of selenite cysteine broth, which was incubated at 37 C for
24 h. Selenite cysteine broth cultures were then streaked onto
CHROMagar Salmonella plates (CHROMagar, Paris, France) and
incubated at 37 C for 24 h. Isolates with a typical phenotype
(mauve colony) were conÔ¨Årmed by PCR using a previously
described method (Rahn et al., 1992). Salmonella isolates were
serotyped by slide agglutination for O and H antigens using

commercially available antiserum (Tianrun Bio-Pharmaceutical,
Ningbo, China), according to manufacturer's instructions.

SAS software (version 9.0, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used
to analyze the prevalence of Salmonella isolates obtained from
different stages. Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test was used to test
for an association between processing stage and the prevalence of
Salmonella isolates, which tells us whether the processing stage
affects the likelihood of contamination; that is, if contamination is
likely to enter the processing chain at one or more speciÔ¨Åc points
rather than randomly.
there was a signiÔ¨Åcant association
(p  0.05) between stages and Salmonella prevalence, then multiple
comparisons of two related stages were performed by partitioning
chi-squares to determine if prevalence of Salmonella at one stage
was correlated with the prevalence at the next. Raw p values were
corrected using the Bonferroni method. Differences were consid-
ered signiÔ¨Åcant when adjusted p  0.008 and highly signiÔ¨Åcant
when adjusted p  0.002.

2.3. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

The disk diffusion test, as described by the Clinical and Labo-
ratory Standards Institute (CLSI, 2013), was performed using
Mueller-Hinton agar plates with disks containing the following 12
antimicrobial agents (Oxoid, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK): amoxi-
cillin/clavulanic acid (AMC), 20 mg/10 mg; nalidixic acid (NAD),
30 mg; ampicillin (AMP), 10 mg; cefazolin (CFZ), 30 mg; doxycycline
(DOX), 30 mg; gentamicin (GEN), 10 mg; trimethoprim/sulfameth-
oxazole (SXT) 1.25 mg/23.75 mg; ceftazidime (CAZ), 30 mg; chlor-
amphenicol (CHL), 30 mg; ciproÔ¨Çoxacin (CIP), 5 mg; meropenem
(MEM), 10 mg; polymyxinB (PB), 300 units. The interpretive cate-
gory for each isolate (susceptible, intermediate, or resistant) was
determined according to the CLSI guidelines (CLSI, 2013). Escher-
ichia coli ATCC 25922 was used as a quality control strain. Salmo-
nella isolates showing resistance to three or more antibiotics were
deÔ¨Åned as MDR isolates.

2.4. Pulsed-Ô¨Åeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE)

Among the 116 S. Enteritidis isolates from the eight broiler
production stages, 40 S. Enteritidis isolates were selected from 73
Salmonella spp. isolates with the predominant antimicrobial resis-
tance pattern for each stage (numbers with boldface type indicated
in Table 3) for PFGE analysis. In addition, six S. Enteritidis isolates
with an NAD-AMP pattern and two S. Enteritidis with an NAD-
AMP-DOX pattern from the Adult broiler stage were chosen for
PFGE analysis, as S. Enteritidis isolates did not have the predomi-
nant antimicrobial resistance pattern for this stage (Table 3). PFGE
analysis was performed according to the PulseNet standardized

protocol for subtyping Salmonella (Hunter et al., 2005; Ribot,
Fitzgerald, Kubota, Swaminathan, & Barrett, 2001), using 50 U of
XbaI restriction endonuclease and the reference strain Salmonella
Braenderup strain H9812. The restriction fragments were separated
using a CHEF Mapper XA pulsed Ô¨Åeld electrophoresis system (Bio-
Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufac-
turer's instructions. Gel images were analyzed using InfoQuest FP
software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Isolates were considered geneti-
cally related if the Dice correlation coefÔ¨Åcient was 80% or greater,
according to Tenover's criterion (Tenover et al., 1995).

3. Results

3.1. Prevalence and serotyping of Salmonella isolates

The prevalence of Salmonella isolates from the broiler chicken
supply chain is summarized in Table 1. A total of 172 Salmonella
isolates were recovered from 1148 samples (14.98%). Approxi-
mately 41.25% of Segmented chicken samples were contaminated
with Salmonella, followed by Carcasses after chilling (26.26%) at the
abattoir. The lowest prevalence of Salmonella was observed in
breeder animals (1.33%). The prevalence of Salmonella at the other
sampling stages varied from 8.00% to 23.02%. Notably, while the
highest prevalence of Salmonella contamination was observed in
the Segmented chicken stage (41.25%), the level of Salmonella
contamination at the Retail chicken stage was signiÔ¨Åcantly lower
(23.02%). In addition, of the 172 Salmonella isolates from the nine
stages, 168 were identiÔ¨Åed as belonging to one of six serotypes,
while the remaining four isolates were untypeable.

Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test showed a signiÔ¨Åcant associa-
tion (p < 0.01) between stage and the prevalence of Salmonella
isolates. Table 1 shows the distribution of Salmonella isolates
among the nine stages. There is a trend of increasing rates of Sal-
monella from the Breeder stage on breeder farms to the Segmented
chicken stage at the abattoir. Further statistical analysis revealed
that the Salmonella infection in the 5-day-broiler stage showed a
highly signiÔ¨Åcant increase (p < 0.0001) over the Breeder stage, and
the Salmonella contamination in Carcasses after chilling presented a
signiÔ¨Åcant increase (p < 0.0001) from Post-cleaning carcasses.
Consequently, these two stages were determined as two important
risk stages. However, the detection rate of Salmonella at the stage of
Retail meat presented a signiÔ¨Åcant decline (p ¬º 0.004), when
compared to that in the stage of Segmented chicken.

3.2. Characterization of antimicrobial susceptibility

All 172 Salmonella isolates were tested for susceptibility to 12
antimicrobial agents. Resistance is summarized in terms of

sampling stages in Table 2. In total, 166 (96.51%) of the 172 isolates
were resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents. All six sus-
ceptible Salmonella isolates came from the Segmented chicken
stage. The highest rate of resistance was for nalidixic acid (88.95%),
followed by ampicillin (76.16%), while resistance to the other
antimicrobial agents was relatively low: doxycycline, 34.88%;
cefazolin, 29.07%; trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 22.67%; genta-
micin, 20.93%; chloramphenicol, 14.53%; amoxicillin/clavulanic
acid, 8.14%; ceftazidime, 4.07%; ciproÔ¨Çoxacin, 1.16%; and mer-
openem, 0.58%.

Antimicrobial resistance patterns of the Salmonella isolates are
outlined in Table 3. Among 172 tested isolates, 22 different patterns
of susceptibility were observed in 166 isolates,
in which 105
exhibited 17 MDR phenotypes, covering all nine broiler supply
stages. All stages, apart from the Carcasses after chilling and Retail
chicken stages, showed a high prevalence (50%) of MDR Salmo-
nella isolates. The two isolates derived from the Breeder stage both
exhibited an MDR phenotype. In addition, the result of relationship
between serotype and MDR phenotype (Table 4) showed that MDR
phenotypes were most commonly associated with S. Enteritidis
isolates (64; 37.20%), followed by S. Infantis isolates (18; 10.47%).

3.3. PFGE analysis of S. Enteritidis from the broiler chicken supply
chain

The 48 S. Enteritidis isolates were subdivided into 14 different
clusters by PFGE analysis. The clusters were named X1eX14, and

consisted of 32 XbaI proÔ¨Åles with coefÔ¨Åcient of similarity values of
36.59%e100% (Fig. 1). The majority of XbaI proÔ¨Åles were assigned to
cluster X1, which represented 20 isolates from the Adult broiler,
Pre-cleaning carcasses, Post-cleaning carcasses, Carcasses after
chilling, and Retail chicken stages. Both the isolates with different
PFGE clusters representing the same antimicrobial resistance pat-
terns and the isolates with identical cluster representing the same
or different antimicrobial resistance patterns were observed
(Fig. 1), indicating no correlation between PFGE pattern and anti-
microbial resistance pattern in S. Enteritidis isolates.

4. Discussion

Many S. enterica serotypes can cause disease in humans. The
serotypes S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium, and S. Heidelberg
contributed to the majority of salmonellosis cases reported in
Canada and the United States (Sivaramalingam, Pearl, McEwen,
Ojkic, & Guerin, 2013). Notably, S. Enteritidis was the most com-
mon serotype isolated along the broiler supply chain in the current
study, which agrees with European Food Safety Authority reports
(EFSA, 2007), and with previous research from Eastern Spain and
China (Marin et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2014). However, this result
differs from Ô¨Åndings in other countries such as South Korea, Viet-
nam, and Cambodia, where S. Hadar, S. Infantis, and S. Anatum are
most prevalent, respectively (Choi et al., 2014; Lay, Vuthy, Song,
Phol, & Sarthou, 2011; Thai & Yamaguchi, 2012). Most interest-
ingly, previous investigations of Salmonella contamination of

broiler chicken supply chains in the Netherlands and Eastern Spain
(Marin et al., 2011; van Asselt, Thissen, & van der Fels-Klerx, 2009)
revealed a much greater diversity in the serotypes of the Salmonella
isolates identiÔ¨Åed compared with the present case. This suggests
that geographical differences exist in the occurrence and domi-
nance of various Salmonella serotypes.

Prevention of Salmonella contamination at any stage requires
detailed knowledge of the most important risk factors associated
with its presence in the broiler chicken supply chain. In our case,
the data about Salmonella-positive isolates has provided detailed
information about contamination along an integrated broiler
chicken supply chain. The riskiest stage for Salmonella contamina-
tion of the Ô¨Çock was the 5-day-old broiler stage, in agreement with
previous Ô¨Åndings about risk factors in Eastern Spain (Marin et al.,
2011). The second important risk stage (Carcasses after chilling)
was found in the abattoir, which may be related to cooling equip-
ment contamination. Similarly, the evidence for contamination of
equipment on a slaughter line and subsequent cross-contamination
to non-infected chickens has been reported previously (Olsen,
Brown, Madsen, & Bisgaard, 2003), which may partly support our
Ô¨Ånding that the contamination becomes more serious with the
increasing degree of mixing in the abattoir. To minimize cross-
contamination, slaughtering equipment is sterilized once a day,
the pool of water used to cool the carcasses is disinfected with
sodium hypochlorite, and organs are conveyed to a separate pro-
duction chain immediately after evisceration. However, these
protocols are not always followed and thus cross-contamination is
allowed. Another major source of Salmonella contamination and
cross-contamination is the hatchery (Davies et al., 1997). Unfortu-
nately, we were unable to obtain permits to collect chicken or egg
samples at the hatcheries in this supply chain.

Antimicrobial resistance represents a serious public health
problem. Increasing antibiotic resistance in S. enterica has led to a
shift in the choice of antibiotics used against this organism, from
chloramphenicol
trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole, Ô¨Çuoroquinolones,
and extended-spectrum
cephalosporins in clinical settings (Roy, Rawat, & Malik, 2015).
Currently,

to

salmonellosis include Ô¨Çuoroquinolones or extended-spectrum
cephalosporins (Folster et al., 2015). In the study, a very high rate
(88.95%) of nalidixic acid resistance was observed in Salmonella
isolates, which is similar to the rate (89.28%) found in Turkey
(Siriken, T√ºrk, Yildirim, Durupinar, & Erol, 2015). Nalidixic acid
resistance plays a role in the initial steps of the development of
ciproÔ¨Çoxacin resistance, although a low rate (1.16%) of ciproÔ¨Çoxacin
resistance was observed in the isolates. It is worth noting that third-
generation cephalosporins have become the primary drugs for the
treatment of salmonellosis because of the recent increase in Ô¨Çuo-
roquinolone resistance (Mawatari et al., 2013). In this study, there
was a high prevalence (29.07%) of resistance to cefazolin, while a
relatively low rate of resistance was observed for ceftazidime
(4.07%), which is a third-generation cephalosporin. Farm managers
the antibiotic usage. Penicillins,
provided information about
amphenicols,
cephalosporins,
tetracycline, and polymyxin were used to treat and prevent bac-
terial diseases during the poultry-rearing period. This study
showed high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella isolates
and MDR Salmonella isolates along the integrated broiler chicken
supply chain, which can likely be attributed to the extensive use of
antibiotics during intensive rearing (Economou & Gousia, 2015). In
addition, to some extent, antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella is
serotype-dependent (Clemente et al., 2014). The data also provided
evidence that S. Enteritidis, the dominant serotype, was strongly
associated with MDR phenotypes. However, these Ô¨Åndings were
contrary to a previous study showing that S. Enteritidis rarely dis-
plays multiple resistance while S. Derby is commonly associated
with multidrug resistance (Newell et al., 2010).

sulfanilamide Ô¨Çuoroquinolones,

Molecular characterization of 48 S. Enteritidis isolates from
eight different stages (all except Breeder) demonstrated that ge-
notype diversity is associated with broiler chicken production
stages. PFGE pattern diversity within a serotype is useful
in
assessing the effectiveness of control measures (Sandt et al., 2013).
PFGE is the most widely used molecular subtyping method for
Salmonella; previous studies using this method have shown that S.
Infantis could be transmitted along the food chain and represent a
hazard to human health (Hauser et al., 2012; Nogrady et al., 2008).

In the present study, we did not Ô¨Ånd a single PFGE pattern covering
all investigated stages, however, 20 of 48 S. Enteritidis strains from
Ô¨Åve of nine different stages (Adult broiler, Pre-cleaning carcasses,
Post-cleaning carcasses, Carcasses after chilling, and Retail chicken)
assigned to the dominant cluster X1, suggesting that the S. Enter-
itidis strain may spread along the broiler chicken chain. In addition,
the diversity of PFGE patterns in the current study may be attrib-
uted to either different S. Enteritidis clones or no correlation among
the samples along the broiler chicken supply chain.

5. Conclusions

The prevalence of Salmonella and its antimicrobial resistance
during the chicken supply chain are always potential risks for hu-
man health. The data presented in this study demonstrate that
samples of a broiler chicken supply chain in Qingdao City, China
were commonly contaminated with Salmonella, especially with the
serotype S. Enteritidis. The result of PFGE suggested that S. Enter-
itidis might spread along the broiler chicken supply chain. Cleaning
procedures on abattoir lines should be reinforced to control Sal-
monella contamination in the broiler chicken supply chain. In
addition, characterization of Salmonella isolates and determination
of high-risk stages will contribute to the implementation of hazard
analysis and critical control point (HACCP) measures for preventing
Salmonella infection of chicken products. The high levels of anti-
biotic resistance and multiple MDR patterns observed amongst
Salmonella isolates suggest that control measures for antimicrobial
usage and surveillance should be put into place to avoid the inap-
propriate use of antibiotics in animal husbandry.
