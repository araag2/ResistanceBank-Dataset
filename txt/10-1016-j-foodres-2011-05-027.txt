A preliminary epidemiological study of Salmonella contamination in laying-hen ﬂocks was carried out in the
regions of Annaba and Eltarf, Algeria, from March to October 2008 and March to November 2009. Our
objectives were (i) to estimate the prevalence of infection by Salmonella spp. in seven pooled samples during
the hens' laying period (ii) to identify the serotypes and antimicrobial resistance phenotypes of isolates, and
(iii) to characterize the factors that may be related to Salmonella contamination in Algerian henhouses. For
this purpose, 18 out of 22 operational laying-hen houses were sampled one to three times during these
periods: once at the start of laying (pullets aged 22–31 weeks), once in the middle of laying (47–60 week) and
once at the end of laying prior to depopulation (70–86 week). The ﬂocks'Salmonella status was assessed by
collecting 2754 environmental samples that were analyzed according to the ISO 6579 method. The antibiotic
resistance of Salmonella strains was tested as per the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI). The relationship between each potential risk factor and the Salmonella status of laying-hen
ﬂocks was evaluated by calculating the relative risk with 95% conﬁdence intervals. Eight ﬂocks tested positive
for Salmonella spp., with a higher prevalence at the end of laying than at either the beginning or middle. Only
19 isolates were recovered from the 2754 samples analyzed and nine different serotypes identiﬁed.
S. enteritidis (n =4) was the most prevalent serovar, along with S. Kentucky and S. Hadar (n=3), followed by
S. Heidelberg, S. Manhattan and S. Virchow (n=2), whereas S. Dublin, S. Typhimurium and S. Albany were
found only once. Thirteen isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent. Of these, six were
resistant to at least three different antimicrobial classes. Salmonella serovar Kentucky isolates were resistant
to ﬂuoroquinolones with ciproﬂoxacin MIC≥ 8 mg/L. Six risk indicators were identiﬁed as potentially related
to the Salmonella status of layer houses.

1. Introduction

Non-typhoid Salmonella is a major bacterial pathogen and the
second cause of
food-borne diseases in Europe and worldwide
(Bouwknegt et al., 2004; Collard et al., 2007; EFSA, 2007a). In France,
Salmonella was isolated from 64% of food-borne outbreaks between
1996 and 2005. These Salmonella outbreaks were the cause of 49% of
all reported cases (Delmas et al., 2006). In the United States, the
Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that
approximately 40,000 cases of human salmonellosis were diagnosed
annually in the 1990s, and that the annual number of non-typhoidal

salmonellosis cases was about 1.4 million (Voetsch et al., 2004). In
addition to the health consequences, human Salmonella infections
have a signiﬁcant ﬁnancial
impact. A study in the Netherlands
estimated the costs of Salmonella infections in 1999 at € 4 million
(Van den Brandhof, de Wit, de Wit, & Van Duynhoven, 2004). An
American study (Bryan & Doyle, 1995) estimated that the costs per
human salmonellosis case range from approximately US $ 40 for
uncomplicated cases to US$ 4.6 million for those ending with
hospitalization and death. There are no accurate data on Salmonella
prevalence in developing countries.

One of the most common sources of human gastroenteritis is the
consumption of Salmonella-infected poultry products, especially eggs
and poultry meat (EFSA, 2009). S. Enteritidis is, together with
S. Typhimurium, the most commonly isolated serotype in human
cases of salmonellosis in Europe (EFSA, 2007a; WHO, 2006), and
contaminated eggs still remain the biggest source of infection from

Salmonella Enteritidis for humans (De Jong & Ekdahl, 2006; Gillepsie
et al., 2005).

The combination of stringent hygiene measures and vaccination has
considerably reduced vertical transmission of Salmonella infection from
parent ﬂocks (Van Immerseel et al., 2004) Horizontal transmission
remains the major source of Salmonella contamination in broiler hen
and egg productions (Chadﬁeld, Permin, Nansen, & Bisgaard, 2001;
Shirota, Katoh, Murase, & Otsuki, 2001). Only a few epidemiological
studies have been carried out to investigate Salmonella infection risk
factors in laying-hen farms. Various risk factors were identiﬁed in these
studies, including (1) large ﬂocks (Mollenhorst, Van Woudenbergh,
Bokkers, & de Boer, 2005; Namata et al., 2008) (2) the age of the sampled
hens, older hens being more likely to be contaminated by Salmonella
(Castellan et al., 2004; Namata et al., 2008), and (3) inefﬁcient cleaning
and disinfection after depopulation for ﬂock renewal (Davies & Breslin,
2003).

It is a common practice in modern food animal husbandry to use
antimicrobials for both therapeutic and prophylactic purposes
(Aarestrup, 2004; Berge, Atwill, & Sischo, 2003; EFSA, 2008). The
subsequent emergence of antimicrobial resistance compromises
animal health by causing therapeutic failure. Furthermore, there
may be adverse consequences for public health because of the spread
of antimicrobial resistance from animals to humans,
leading to
treatment failure in human infectious diseases (EFSA, 2009; Jordan
et al., 2009).

In Algeria, poultry and egg productions have increased substan-
tially since the mid-1980s, supported by an incentive policy. Poultry
production has increased from 162,000 t in 1985 to 270,000 t in 1995,
largely due to state subsidies. It currently provides 10 kg of poultry
meat annually per capita, and fresh egg production is self-sufﬁcient.
According to Algerian agricultural ministry data, egg production
increased from an average 32,000 t in 1982 to 120,000 t in 1995
(Anonymous, 2003). Egg consumption has also increased from 96
eggs annually per capita to 120 in 1989 (Anonymous, 2003).

Concomitantly, several outbreaks of salmonellosis have been
observed in Algeria during recent years in both humans and food
animal production, particularly poultry (Aboun et al., 2003; Ayachi,
Alloui, Bennoune, & Kassah-Laouar, 2010). However, the public health
consequences and economic impact of Salmonella in the Algerian
poultry breeding sector are unknown because there are no epidemi-
ological surveillance systems or monitoring programs for Salmonella
infections in this country.

The main aims of this study were therefore (i) to determine the
prevalence of Salmonella in laying-hen ﬂocks in 2 regions of Algeria,
(ii) identify the serotypes present in these regions and their
antimicrobial resistance, and ﬁnally (iii) to evaluate the risk factors
that might inﬂuence the Salmonella contamination of laying-hen
ﬂocks.

2. Material and methods

2.1. Study design

The study was conducted in two regions in the eastmost part of
Algeria from March 2008 to November 2009. The list and location of
farms were obtained from ofﬁcial veterinary authorities for these
regions and through our epidemiological investigation. During these
two years, 22 operational layer houses were studied in both regions.
All henhouse owners were invited to participate in the study, with
absolute anonymity guaranteed for the farmer. A positive result
would not have any adverse consequences. In all, 18 out of 22 layer
houses with only one laying ﬂock participated in the study for both
years. Two farm owners (representing four layer houses) did not wish
to participate. Flock sizes ranged from 2400 to 7200 hens. Pullets were
loaded when 18 weeks old. Thirteen ﬂocks comprised Isa Brown hens
and ﬁve comprised Hy-Line hens. No sign of disease or pathology was

found on the farms. Started pullets were typically vaccinated against
Newcastle, Marek and Gumboro diseases. None of the sampled ﬂocks
was vaccinated against Salmonella. In most cases, owners are not just
farmers and consider poultry farming a secondary occupation. The
exact number of farmers may therefore ﬂuctuate each year depending
on the egg market and feed price.

All the henhouses in these regions are ﬁtted out with conventional
battery cages. Most of the buildings (16/18) have natural ventilation.
Six out of 18 buildings had mixed structures: solid brick and cement
walls, with a roof of zinc sheets. Fourteen layer houses were
connected to the public electricity network and only four had an
electric generator. One farmer raises his own pullets, but all the other
farmers in these regions buy started pullets from rearing farms either
in the same regions (7/18) or in neighboring regions (10/18). Most
farmers obtained feed from a single public company or from ﬁve
private organizations in these regions. The productive lifespan of
laying hens is around 15 months.

2.2. Time of sampling

Samples were taken in two successive years, from May to October
2008 and March to November 2009. Thirteen hen ﬂocks were sampled
three times, but layer house access difﬁculties resulted in two ﬂocks
being sampled twice and three only once. The ﬁrst visit was scheduled at
the beginning of the laying period (pullets aged 22–31 weeks) for 15
hen ﬂocks, the second about halfway through laying (47–60 weeks) for
14 ﬂocks, and the third visit was late in the laying period, prior to
depopulation (maximum 9 weeks before) for 17 ﬂocks. The age of hens
in the last henhouse sampled ranged from 70 to 86 weeks. Four
henhouses were sampled at the end of laying (74–82 week) for an initial
ﬂock and at the beginning and middle of the laying period in the
subsequent ﬂocks living in the same henhouses. A ﬂock was considered
Salmonella-positive when the bacterium was isolated from at least one
sample in the ﬂocks.

2.3. Questionnaire design

A questionnaire was ﬁlled in during an onsite interview while
collecting samples. It was used to gather information on the general
characteristics of laying-hen ﬂocks, dead-bird management, control of
rodents and other domestic animals, biosecurity measures, farm staff
and visitors, vaccination and administration of antibiotics. Of the
questionnaire's 95 questions, 75% were closed-ended. The visit was
completed by ﬁlling in a questionnaire based both on personal
observations and on information obtained from the employees in
charge of looking after the laying-hen ﬂocks. A supplemental Table
includes the questionnaire's 95 questions.

2.4. Sample collection

A total of 2754 samples were collected over two periods. The
following seven pooled samples were collected from each ﬂock at
each visit: two pools of 15 fresh feces samples from under the cages,
one pool of ﬁve fecal samples from the cages themselves, one pool of
seven surface swabs, one pool of seven dust swabs from inside and
outside the cages, and two pools of feed and water samples. On each
sampling visit, 61 samples were collected from henhouses containing
4800 to 7200 hens, and 57 samples from henhouses containing 2400
to 3100 hens.

Pools of 15 fresh feces samples were collected randomly
throughout the henhouse from the ground under the cages. To ensure
that the samples were representative, the building was divided into
ﬁve sectors and three fresh feces were collected from each sector.
Each pooled feces sample weighed approximately 150 g. Fecal
samples were scraped off the ﬂoor under the cages. These samples
weighed approximately 50 g.

899

One pool of seven samples was collected on swabs from cages, and
1 pool of seven surface samples was collected from different places in
each henhouse, such as walls, water and feeding equipment.

For technical and economic reasons, during the ﬁrst visit, we used
cotton-tipped swabs for environmental samples. The cotton-tipped
swab was moistened with sterile water and used to swab 5–10 cm of
cage surfaces, beneath and inside empty cages or troughs under nipple
lines. The cotton-tipped swabs were also used to wipe 20 cm² of feeding
and watering equipment. For this, each layer house was divided into
seven subsections, with three cotton-tipped swabs for each subsection.
four drag swabs (AES
Chemunex, Combourg, France) were used to collect dust from seven
cages in various places within each henhouse. Each swab was
sufﬁciently absorbent to collect the dust and dry manure from the
surfaces beneath and inside two empty cages per swab.

During the second sampling period,

Three drag swabs were also used to swab a 0.5 m2 surface area of
feeding equipment and approximately 30 cm² per swab of henhouse
walls. One pool of four samples of feed and one pool of four samples of
water were collected from ﬂocks with 2400 to 3100 hens. Four 5 g sub-
samples of feed were collected from feeders, and four 5 mL sub-samples
of water were collected from nipples and reservoirs. For ﬂocks with
4800 to 7200 hens, six 5 g sub-samples of feed and six 5 mL sub-samples
of water were collected from feeders, nipples or reservoirs.

Samples were taken from different places on each sampling visit.
The pooled samples were placed individually in sterile recipients or
sterile plastic pouches. Gloves were changed between each collection
of pooled samples. The samples were transported to the laboratory in
an icebox with freezer packs within 2 h of collection. Bacteriological
analysis was usually initiated on the day of sampling but sometimes
stored in the fridge at 4 °C for analysis the following day.

2.5. Bacteriological analysis of samples

The bacteriological analysis of samples was carried out according
to standard norm ISO 6579: 2002 (ISO (Comité international de
normalisation AW/9), 2002). Twenty ﬁve grams of each pooled feces
and feed sample was weighed before adding 225 mL of buffered
peptone water (BPW) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Each pool of
drag swabs used to sample dust and surfaces was immersed
separately in 100 mL BPW per swab. Each cotton-tipped swab was
placed in 9 mL BPW, and 25 mL water samples were placed in sterile
bags containing 225 mL buffered peptone water. Pooled feces and
feed samples were mixed in a Stomacher bag for 1 min. All the
samples were incubated for 18±2 h at 37 °C. Two milliliters of this
pre-enrichment broth was then used to inoculate a 20 mL Mueller-
Kauffmann tetrathionate-Novobiocin (MKTTn) broth (AES Chemu-
nex, Combourg, France) and 100 μL of the pre-enrichment broth was
used to inoculate 10 mL Rappaport-Vassiliadis broth (Biokar, Beau-
vais, France). Both media were incubated for 24 h at 37 and 42 °C
respectively. Following incubation, one loopful from each selective
enrichment tube was streaked over two selective media – Hektoen
and Xylose Lysine Deoxycholate agar plates (AES Chemunex,
Combourg, France) – prior to incubation at 37 °C for 18 to 24 h. Two
typical colonies of Salmonella were conﬁrmed by biochemical assays
on Triple Sugar Iron (Biokar, Beauvais, France) and API20E strips
(BioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Salmonella isolates were then
serotyped by a slide agglutination test with polyvalent O and H
antiserum (Bio-Rad, Marne la coquette, France). The Kauffmann–
White scheme was used to serotype the different isolates (Popoff,
2001).

2.6. Antibiotic resistance analysis

Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by the disk diffusion
method on Mueller-Hinton agar (Bio-Rad) in accordance with the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) standard (CLSI,

2006). The antimicrobial agents tested were ampicillin (10 μg),
amoxicillin+clavulanic acid (20, 10 μg), cephalothin (30 μg), cefo-
taxime (30 μg), ceftazidime (30 μg), sulphonamides (300 μg), cotri-
moxazole (1.25/23.75 μg), gentamicin (10 μg), streptomycin (10 μg),
kanamycin (30 μg), tetracycline (30 μg), chloramphenicol (30 μg),
nalidixic acid (30 μg), oﬂoxacin (5 μg) and enroﬂoxacin (5 μg). Zone
diameters were read using the automated Osiris scanner (Bio-Rad),
interpreted as per CLSI guidelines (CLSI, 2009). Escherichia coli ATCC
25922 was used as quality-control organism.

2.7. Statistical analyses for factors associated with Salmonella ﬂock
contamination

Data were analyzed using Epi-Info® software (Epi Info 3.5.1, Centers
for disease control and prevention (CDC), Atlanta, Freeware). Only
univariate analyses were performed due to the small sample. Links
between a certain factor and the presence of Salmonella did not
therefore take into account potential confounders as multivariate
regression models do. However, univariate associations suggest risk
indicators, and are a preliminary but necessary step in the investigation
of risk factors for any disease. Statistical analyses were limited to Fisher's
Exact tests and calculation of Relative Risks (RR) with their 95%
conﬁdence intervals in order to quantify the relationship between each
factor and the Salmonella status of laying-hen ﬂocks. Discrepancies may
exist between p-values and 95% conﬁdence interval boundaries because
Fisher's Exact test is a non-parametric test and 95% conﬁdence intervals
are calculated using a parametric method. The signiﬁcance of
associations is based on Fisher's Exact test, and not on the presence or
absence of 1 in the conﬁdence intervals. Only factors with a RR≥2 are
presented. All tests were two-tailed and p-values b0.05 were considered
signiﬁcant.

3. Results

3.1. Salmonella prevalence

Eight of the 18 ﬂocks tested positive for Salmonella spp. Table 1 gives
a detailed overview of the laying-hen ﬂocks sampled. Salmonella
contamination was higher at the end of the laying period than at the
beginning or middle. The 70- to 86-wk-old hens had the highest
prevalence of Salmonella (7/17, 41.17%), followed by the 22- to 31-wk-
old hens, which had a prevalence of 20% (3/15). Salmonella prevalence
was lowest halfway through laying (47–60 week) with 7.14% (1/14).
Furthermore, of the three layer houses tested positive at the beginning
of laying, Salmonella had been isolated at the end of laying in the
previous two ﬂocks reared in the same layer houses. However, no
statistical analysis on the association of Salmonella prevalence and the
hens' three age classes could be performed because of the relatively
small number of ﬂocks sampled.

The number of positive samples within ﬂocks was very low. Only
19 out of 2754 samples analyzed tested positive for Salmonella.
Thirteen isolates (0.80%) were recovered from the 1610 feces samples
and four (1.24%) from the 322 dust samples. Salmonella was also
isolated from two (0.80%) out of 250 water samples (Table 2).

3.2. Serovars encountered and antimicrobial resistance patterns

The serotyping of 19 Salmonella strains revealed nine serovars
from eight positive ﬂocks, but no clearly dominant serovar emerged.
One serovar was isolated in ﬁve positive ﬂocks, and two serovars were
isolated in three other ﬂocks (Table 1). The six most prevalent
serovars were S. Enteritidis (n=4), S. Kentucky (n=3), S. Hadar
(n=3), S. Virchow (n=2), S. Heidelberg (n=2) and S. Manhattan
(n=2) (Table 2). S. Enteritidis and S. Virchow were each recovered
from two successive ﬂocks reared in the same two houses (ﬂocks no. 2

S. Kentucky and two isolates of S. Hadar were resistant to ampicillin,

cephalotin too. The three S. Kentucky isolates were also resistant
to ﬂuoroquinolones (enroﬂoxacin, oﬂoxacin, and ciproﬂoxacin were
tested, MICcipro≥ 8 mg/L). S. Typhimurium was resistant to ampicil-
lin. S. Manhattan, S. Virchow and S. Dublin isolates were 100%

3.3. Risk indicators associated with the Salmonella status of ﬂocks

Six out of ﬁfteen risk indicators were considered as pertinent
indicators since their RR was ≥2. However, none was found to be
signiﬁcantly related to contamination (p b0.05; Table 3), probably
because of the small population. Salmonella contamination of ﬂocks
was more frequent when (i) the layer house was easily accessible
(RR=3.5, CI 95%=0.5, 25; p=0.1), (ii) the buildings were not
disinfected before pullets were loaded (RR=2.7, CI 95%=0.4, 16.9,
p=0.2), (iii) ventilation was poor (RR=2.6; CI 95%=1.03, 6.5;
p=0.08), (iv) dead hens were stored on the farms for at least 1 week
(RR=2.6; CI 95%=1.0, 6.5; p=0.08), (v) we observed living or dead
rodents inside the henhouse on each sampling visit (RR=2.6; CI
95%=0.8, 7.6; p=0.08), and when (vi) cages were dry cleaned only
before pullets were loaded (RR = 2, CI 95% = 0.7, 5.3; p = 0.2)
(Table 3).

4. Discussion

4.1. Prevalence

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst epidemiological study of
Salmonella contamination in laying-hen ﬂocks ever carried out in
the Annaba and Eltarf regions of Algeria. Prior to this research, very
little information was available on Salmonella prevalence in Algerian
poultry farms. Although the study by Elgroud et al. (2009) and the
present study are not strictly comparable in terms of breeding type,
housing system and methodology of sampling, it might be worth
pointing out that the prevalence estimated by Elgroud et al. (2009)
emphasizes quite a high level of Salmonella contamination in Algerian
poultry farms. The results of our own study show that eight ﬂocks
(44.4%) tested positive for Salmonella during the laying period. Within
the European Union, a baseline study conducted by EFSA between
October 2004 and September 2005 on laying-hen ﬂocks at the end of
the rearing period showed an average prevalence of Salmonella-
positive ﬂocks of 30.8% (EFSA, 2007b). The Salmonella prevalence in
this kind of ﬂock varied widely between member states: 17.9% in
France (Huneau-Salaün et al., 2009), 31.08% in Belgium (Namata et al.,
2008), 79% in Portugal (Hald, 2008) and 0% in Sweden and
Luxembourg (Van Hoorebeke et al., 2010).

Our results should be interpreted with caution because of the
relatively small number of sampled ﬂocks, and because the sample
was not randomized from the Algerian laying-hen population, which
restricts comparability with research in developed countries on
Salmonella prevalence in egg-laying ﬂocks. It should nevertheless be
emphasized that our study is practically exhaustive with respect to
these two regions, and that poultry breeding in these regions is similar
to poultry breeding nationwide. We consequently consider that our
study may be representative enough for a preliminary estimation of
the prevalence of Salmonella contamination in Algerian laying-hen
ﬂocks. It should also be noted that the same person was responsible
for visiting all the farms and collecting all the data, which should make
data collection and interpretation more uniform.

Our results show that Salmonella prevalence was higher at the end
of the laying period than at the beginning or middle. It is well known
that the chance of detecting Salmonella in a ﬂock increases as the hens
get older (Namata et al., 2008). It can be attributed to the fact that the
layers are physiologically stressed when reared in close conﬁnement
in caged systems and particularly during egg production. Several
authors have reported that the stress factors such as the onset of lay,
high temperatures, induced molting, ﬁnal stages of the production
period or transportation to the slaughterhouse can cause recurrences
of Salmonella excretion (Golden et al., 2008; Humphrey, 2006; Van de
Giessen et al., 2006). Furthermore, in this work, two out of three
henhouses that tested positive at the beginning of laying had been
declared positive at the end of the previous ﬂocks' laying period. Four
Salmonella isolates were recovered from dust samples when subse-
quent ﬂocks were housed in the same henhouses. It was previously
thought that dust samples can give more accurate information on the
layer house's past Salmonella status (Arnalod, Carrique-Mas, & Davies,
2009). The result of the current study clearly corroborates this ﬁnding.
The proportion of positive samples in our study is quite low—only
19, or 0.68%. Despite the relatively short transportation time and the
larger number of samples taken in our study, Salmonella was only
found in a few sampled environments. However, several studies have
shown that the intensive sampling of laying-hen environments is
regarded as an effective method for detecting Salmonella in laying-hen
ﬂocks with a low contamination level (Aho, 1992; Carrique-Mas et al.,
2009; Musgrove & Jones, 2005). The low proportion of Salmonella in
seven pooled samples in this study may be explained by the low
degree of shedding at the time of sampling and/or the intermittent
excretion of Salmonella by infected birds (Van Immerseel et al., 2004).
Furthermore, this ﬁnding indicates that this sampling protocol

(limited to pooled feces, dust and environmental samples) used in
our study is not sufﬁciently sensitive in ﬂocks where the bacterium is
only shed in very small amounts, or not shed at all. We might suppose
that in layer houses which are apparently Salmonella-negative, on the
basis of the results from the bacteriological analysis of all pooled
samples, a proportion of the hens may still carry the pathogen without
shedding it, leading to an underestimation of the actual prevalence of
Salmonella in the studied ﬂocks. This is suggested by the data reported
by Van Hoorebeke et al. (2009), which indicate that the post-mortem
examination of hens (cecal and/or ovary/oviduct samples) is the most
accurate test to determine the infection status of laying-hen ﬂocks
with a low Salmonella contamination level.

4.2. Serovars and antibiotic resistance

The distribution of Salmonella serovars identiﬁed in the present
study was particularly heterogeneous. Salmonella Enteritidis was the
most commonly isolated serovar in terms of number of isolates
(n=4), but it was recovered in only one henhouse. A single isolate of
Salmonella Typhimurium was recovered during our investigation.
Nationally, S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium serotypes are the most
frequently isolated from poultry samples.
In a study conducted
between 1998 and 2002 by the Pasteur Institute in Algiers on 51,826
samples from all types of poultry farms including hens, eggs
and turkeys, 112 out of positive strains belonged to the serovar
S. Enteritidis (Aboun et al., 2003). In 2006, 26 conﬁrmed outbreaks
involving Salmonella Enteritidis and Typhimurium were reported in
northern regions of the country in different poultry farms, including
laying-hen ﬂocks (Anonymous, 2006), and 25 conﬁrmed outbreaks in
2008 involved Salmonella Enteritidis (Anonymous, 2009). During this
study (March 2008 to November 2009), 50 strains of S. Typhimurium
and eight strains of S. Enteritidis were recovered in human patients
from both Annaba and Eltarf regions. Unfortunately, no information is
available about the possible link between these clinical cases and egg
consumption. It is also worth mentioning that many cases may not be
reported because the ill person either does not visit a doctor or no
sample is obtained for laboratory tests. Voetsch et al. (2004) estimated
that for each laboratory-conﬁrmed case of Salmonella, there are 38
cases that are missed through a lack of surveillance. In the European
Union, S. Enteritidis was the most commonly reported serovar in 2008
(58.0% of all conﬁrmed cases), followed by Salmonella Typhimurium
(21.9%) (EFSA, 2010). The number of S. Enteritidis cases is tending
to decrease in EU member states, increasing the relative proportion of
S. Typhimurium cases.

In our research project, Salmonella Kentucky was recovered from
three different laying-hen ﬂocks, two isolates of S. Manhattan and one
isolate of S. Albany were found in a single ﬂock respectively. The
serotypes S. Kentucky, S. Manhattan, and S. Albany are not usually
isolated from poultry samples in Algeria. These isolates may have
been acquired from the environment or animals' sources indicating
the diversity of the potential reservoirs of nontyphoidal Salmonella.
Unfortunately, no investigations have been conducted to identify the
origin of contamination. A single strain of Salmonella Dublin was
isolated once in a water sample in our study. This serotype is rarely
encountered in poultry, and more frequently associated with bovine
production. Its presence may be the consequence of the presence of
other animals on the farm and the absence of precautionary measures
by farm staff. Serovar diversity could suggest a plethora of sources: the
environment, feed, water, easy access to other animal species, carried
by farm workers and more.

In this study, the number of isolates resistant to at least three
antimicrobials is relatively small and could indicate that the use of
antibiotics in laying-hen ﬂocks remains moderate. None of the ﬂocks
was treated with antimicrobials according to farmers' statements. The
overall limited antimicrobial usage in egg-producing laying hens in
our study is in accordance with previous studies on laying hens

902

N. Bouzidi et al. / Food Research International 45 (2012) 897–904

(Kojima et al., 2009; Schwaiger, Schmied, & Bauer, 2008, 2010), which
showed that the levels of antimicrobial resistance in laying hens are
relatively low compared to broilers, pigs and, to a lesser extent, cattle
(Bywater et al., 2004; De Jong et al., 2009; Persoons et al., 2009). In the
current study, seven Salmonella isolates were found to be resistant to
tetracycline and streptomycin. Resistance to these antimicrobials is
commonly observed among Salmonella isolates and has been reported
by several studies in poultry products (Manie, Khan, Brozel, Veith, &
Gouws, 1998; Nayak et al., 2004). In the present study, resistance to
nalidixic acid was detected in twelve isolates belonging to ﬁve
serotypes, and resistance to ciproﬂoxacin was only detected in three
isolates of S. Kentucky with MIC≥8 mg/L. The presence of isolates
resistant to ﬂuoroquinolones is more worrying, as this class of
antimicrobials is often used to treat severe human salmonellosis. To
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst isolation of ciproﬂoxacin-resistant
S. Kentucky in Algeria, but no investigation has been conducted to
identify the source of contamination. This coincides with ﬁndings of
similar ciproﬂoxacin-resistant isolates of S. Kentucky isolated by the
Pasteur Institute in Paris at the same time and related to travelers
returning from northeast and eastern Africa (Le Hello et al., 2010). In
poultry, this ciproﬂoxacin resistant Kentucky clone was isolated from
chickens and turkeys in three noncontiguous African countries
(Ethiopia, Morocco, and Togo), suggesting that poultry may be an
important vehicle for infection by this strain (Le Hello et al., 2010). A
possible source of contamination of African poultry could be the
aquaculture farms in the North–East or East of Africa, as they use
antimicrobial agents intensively. This ciproﬂoxacin-resistant S. Ken-
tucky clone may have spread to poultry through ﬁsh meal feeds
originating from these aquaculture farms. In our investigation, the
antimicrobial resistance tests revealed a resistance to cephalotin in
ﬁve isolates from two serotypes, S. Hadar and S. Kentucky. No isolate
resistant to third-generation cephalosporin has been isolated, unlike
human isolates from these regions (data not shown) that showed a
considerable increase in resistance to third-generation cephalospo-
rins in hospitals.

4.3. Risk Indicators associated with the Salmonella status of ﬂocks

In accordance with documented research, we identiﬁed six risk
indicators with RR values ≥2. None were statistically signiﬁcant, but
we cannot rule out a lack of statistical power due to our restricted
sample.

The absence of a fence at the entrance of henhouses appears to
inﬂuence the Salmonella status of laying-hen ﬂocks. Salmonella was
found more frequently on farms where non-essential visitors have
easy access to the layer houses (58.3% vs 16.7%). A fence also seems to
be effective in protecting the buildings from access by domestic or
wild animals. A fence also restricts admittance of persons, especially
visitors not on the farming staff, who could be indirect mechanical
vectors of the bacteria, as seen in previous studies (Cardinale, Tall,
Gueye, Cisse, & Salvat, 2004; Hald, Wedderkopp, & Madsen, 2000;
Hunneau-Salaün, Denis, Balaine, & Salvat, 2007).

The absence of disinfection before new pullets were loaded
appeared to be a risk indicator and revealed a potential link to
Salmonella contamination. Seven out of 13 ﬂocks where no disinfec-
tant was used were found to be Salmonella-positive (53.8% vs 20%).
This result might indicate an inadequate cleaning and disinfection
procedure. The persistence of Salmonella contamination between two
successive ﬂocks housed in the same building was probably a
consequence of this ineffective cleaning procedure. Research on
broiler chickens (Baggesen, Olsen, & Bisgaard, 1992; Lahellec et al.,
1986) has demonstrated that ineffective cleaning and disinfection
could be the predominant risk factor of Salmonella contamination.

Salmonella is found more often in layer houses where dead birds
are stored on the farm for at least 1 week (80% vs 30.8%). Keeping the
dead birds on the farms may increase the number of insects, ﬂies,

beetles and pests which can act as a vector for several diseases and
pathogenic bacteria. For the farms evaluated in this study, four out of
ﬁve henhouses where numerous ﬂies were observed inside the layer
houses during sampling visits tested positive for Salmonella. This
observation underlines the importance of biosecurity measures to
protect birds from infections and their dissemination. It is also in
agreement with previous studies (Craven et al., 2000; Hoover,
Kenney, Amick, & Hypes, 1997; Liljebjelke et al., 2005).

The layer house ventilation system appeared to be a risk indicator
for the ﬂock's Salmonella contamination in our study. It may be
indirectly an evidence of a potential link between high temperature
inside the henhouses, due to the poor ventilation, and the presence of
Salmonella.
In the current study, 16 henhouses were ventilated
naturally by windows and doors, and only two featured a mechanical
ventilation system. Of the ﬁve henhouses where there were not
enough windows and where air renewal was insufﬁcient and the
temperature high (N30 °C), four were contaminated (80% vs 30.8%).
The lack of fresh air circulating inside the henhouse leads to high
inside temperatures, especially in summer. High temperatures can
cause agitation and stress in hens, which can subsequently lead to
Salmonella excretion. Stress has already been shown to have an
immunosuppressive effect in laying hens (El-Lethey, Huber-Eicher, &
Jungi, 2003; Humphrey, 2006), with possible negative consequences
on Salmonella shedding.

The observed presence of living or dead rodents inside the
henhouses appears to inﬂuence the Salmonella contamination of
layer ﬂocks in our study (71.4% vs 27.3%). It has been reported that
conventional battery cage housing is a more attractive environment
for pests because the caged hens cannot move around as much
(Carrique-Mas, Marin, Breslin, McLaren, & Davies, 2009). In our study,
rodents inside the layer house may be a risk factor because they can
act as vectors for Salmonella. The number of ﬂocks studied is too small
to conﬁrm this tendency. However, studies carried out on broiler
chickens and laying-hen ﬂocks identiﬁed rodents as a potential source
of Salmonella contamination and persistence in poultry houses
(Henzler, Ebel, Sanders, Kradel, & Mason, 1994; Henzler & Opitz,
1992).

The dry cleaning of cages appears to inﬂuence the Salmonella
contamination of ﬂocks in our study (53.8% vs 20%), and reveals a
potential link to Salmonella prevalence in layer houses. It is a well-
known fact that the cage systems are not dismantled and are
consequently extremely difﬁcult to clean and disinfect because of
the restricted access to cage interiors, feeders, egg belts and so forth
(Carrique-Mas, Breslin, et al., 2009; Davies & Breslin, 2003). In the
current study, the fact that two Salmonella serovars were present in
dust samples from cages in the second hen ﬂocks reared in the same
layer houses was probably the result of this difﬁculty in efﬁciently
cleaning the cages.

5. Conclusion

The current study provides baseline data on the Salmonella
contamination of Algerian laying-hen ﬂocks and some useful
information on the presence of Salmonella, antimicrobial resistance
and the associated risk factors for laying-hen farms. We showed that
eight ﬂocks tested positive for Salmonella among 18 ﬂocks sampled
and that layer life stages also affected the prevalence of Salmonella
recovered from the seven pooled samples. The results of this study
also illustrate that, despite using an extended sampling protocol on
ﬂock (3 pooled feces samples, 2 pools of dust and environmental
swabs, 2 pools of water and feed samples), the proportion of positive
samples remains very low (19/2754). We also revealed the presence
of multiple Salmonella serovars, and a small proportion of antibiotic-
resistant isolates, which may suggest a moderate use of antibiotics in
Algerian laying-hen ﬂocks. Unfortunately, no published data is
available regarding the use of antimicrobial on Algerian farms. In

N. Bouzidi et al. / Food Research International 45 (2012) 897–904

the present study, we report here the presence of ciproﬂoxacin-
resistant S. Kentucky in the studied ﬂocks that coincide with its
emergence in other countries throughout Africa and the Middle East.
However, the low number of isolates that may be due to limitation of
the Algerian area studied does not allow assessing the potential
introduction of ciproﬂoxacin Kentucky clone at a national level. Six
risk indicators were identiﬁed as being potentially linked to the
Salmonella contamination of laying-hen houses. Most have already
been reported as potential risk factors for Salmonella contamination in
laying-hen ﬂocks. In the future, these initial ﬁndings may be used as
the basis for national epidemiological studies to determine the
prevalence of Salmonella spp. in Algerian laying-hen ﬂocks and to
investigate the risk indicators implicated in Salmonella spp contam-
ination, the different serovars present and even any relationship
between egg production and human outbreaks of Salmonella.
