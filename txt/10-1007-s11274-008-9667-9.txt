Abstract The study was conducted to quantify the con-
cordance of antibiotic resistance and ERIC-PCR DNA
ﬁngerprint pattern in Escherichia coli (E. coli) isolated from
farmers and their broilers of 95 broiler farms in Songkhla
province, Thailand. Four hundred and ﬁfty-seven and 460
E. coli isolates from both groups produced 35 patterns of
antibiotics
resistance. Mono-resistance to doxycycline
(23.2%) in isolates from farmers and multiple resistance to
doxycycline, nalidixic acid, norﬂoxacin and ciproﬂoxacin
(17.8%) were the most common ﬁnding in broilers. Twenty-
seven farms had 44 within-farm concordant patterns of
resistance. From simulation, the frequency of concordance
was signiﬁcantly higher than concordance by chance alone
(P \ 0.05). Out of these 44 matched sets, only four had the
same DNA ﬁngerprint pattern. Concordance by DNA pattern
was also not associated with phenotypic resistance. Clonal
spread is therefore not a good explanation of the concordance
in this population. Other mechanisms need further analysis.

humans and animals, antimicrobial resistance has become a
global public problem leading to treatment failure and
severity of infection (WHO 1997). Many studies have
shown the spread of antimicrobial resistance from animal
to human (Miles et al. 2006; Ojeniyi 1989; Oppegaard
et al. 2001; Saida et al. 1981; van den Bogaard et al. 2001,
2002). Yet the extent at the population level is not known.
Studies are often based on animals alone without close
contact with human. Same phenotypical resistance patterns
can be a result of chance alone and are often not supported
by genotyping matching. Thus the evidence of cross
infection is not strong. A population-based study on anti-
biotic resistance in humans in close contact with animals
with phenotypic and genotypic matching is needed to assist
control programs in the planning and for the evaluation of
this problem.

Thailand has a large amount of poultry production. In
2005,
there were over 30,000 households producing
approximately 150 million broilers (Department of Live-
stock Development 2006c). Antibiotic use is known to be
heavy. The amount of antibiotics used in 1998 was
approximately USD 23 million (Thai Drug Control Divi-
sion 2003) but details on animal species and the level of
antibiotic resistance among the bacteria in the farm has
rarely been reported. From our previous study, antibiotic
use in broiler farms of southern Thailand is very common.
Since broiler farmers are in close contact with the animals,
they are good candidates to test the existence of animal to
human transmission of antibiotic resistance microbials. The
objectives of this study were (1) to document the preva-
lence and pattern of antibiotic resistance,
to test
whether the concordance could be explained by chance and
(3) to examine the extent of clonal spread of antibiotics
resistance to E. coli within the same farm sampled from
farmers and broilers in farms in rural southern Thailand.

from farms with E. coli from the farmers and broilers were
used in the analysis.

The study is a cross-sectional survey conducted from
November 2004 to April 2005.

Antibiotic resistance testing

Study site

Songkhla is a province with a population of 1.5 million and
is located in the southern part of Thailand bordering
Malaysia to the west. It plays an important role in the food
industry as the number of households involved in animal
food production was 34,976 (Department of Livestock
Development 2006b). Out of these, 402 broiler farms
produced 1,223,264 broilers in 2005 (Department of
Livestock Development 2006a, c). The products are both
locally consumed and exported to nearby provinces.
Antibiotic use has been reported to be heavy. Major types
include enroﬂoxacin, amoxicillin, doxycycline and colis-
tine (Na Lampang et al. 2007).

Sampling technique

From the list of the farms registered at the Songkhla Pro-
vincial Livestock Ofﬁce, 101 broiler farms were selected
by simple random sampling. Selection criteria included: at
least 500 broilers in the farm, safety from political unrest
and accessibility by paved road. After giving consent at
each selected farm, a randomly selected farmer who had
been in close contact with the broilers and had never taken
antibiotics in the previous 2 months was asked permission
for a fecal swab. Three broilers were randomly selected
from the same farm and cloacal swabs were carried out. All
swabs were kept in transport media and sent to the labo-
ratory on the same day.

E. coli isolation

On the day of arrival at the laboratory, the cloacal swabs
from the broilers were mixed with 0.9% sterile normal
saline solution and cultured on MacConkey agar (Merck) at
37°C overnight. Suspected E. coli colonies were inoculated
onto Urea agar (Merck), Triple iron agar, Simmons’ citrate
agar and Motility-indole-lysine media (Difco). Identiﬁca-
tion of E. coli was done based on biochemical reactions
standard (Quinn et al. 1994). Three to ﬁve colonies were
randomly selected and subcultured for antibiotics resis-
tance pattern and genotype analysis. Only isolates

123

Antibiotic resistance tests were performed by the standard
disc diffusion technique recommended by the National
Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS).
The selection criteria of antibiotics testing discs depended
on the regularly use of antibiotics in the broiler farm,
potential public health importance and recommended from
the guideline of antibiotic susceptibility testing from
NCCLS. Resistance testing discs contained amoxicillin/
clavulanic (20:10 lg), nalidixic acid (30 lg), norﬂoxacin
(10 lg), ciproﬂoxacin (5 lg), doxycycline (30 lg), ceftri-
axone (30 lg), cefuroxime (30 lg) and cephalothin
(30 lg) (Oxoid). The isolates were considered resistant if
the diameter of inhibition zone was less than or equal to the
resistance breakpoint recommended by NCCLS guidelines.
Quality control of diameters of inhibition zone against the
level of resistance was based on standard E. coli (ATCC
25922) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923).

Genotyping E. coli isolates

Isolates from farmers and broilers from the same farm with
the same antibiotics resistance pattern were used for geno-
type matching test by Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic
Concensus (ERIC) Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
described by Meacham et al. (2003). This method does not
require the large quantities of DNA, is not time consuming
and the equipment is not expensive. E. coli DNA was
extracted from overnight growth of a pure culture. The cells
were lysed by boiling for 15 min. The lysate was then cen-
trifuged at 15,000g for 1 min. PCR ampliﬁcations were
performed in 25 ll volumes containing 5 mM MgCl2, 2 U of
Platinum Taq polymerase, 0.4 mM (each) deoxynucleoside
triphosphates, 10 ng of crude template DNA and 25 pmol of
(50-AAGTAAGTGACTGGGGTGA
the ERIC2 primer
GCG-30). The PCR ampliﬁcation started with hot start at
94°C for 2 min, denature at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 60°C
for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 4.5 min after 35 cycles a
ﬁnal extension for 1 min at 72°C. The ampliﬁcation products
were resolved by gel electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels
stained with 10 mg/ml ethidium bromide and normalized
using a 100 base pair ladder (Invitrogen). Gels were run at
80 V for 1.5 h. Strips of ERIC-PCR DNA patterns of E. coli
from the same farms were read under direct inspection and of
the bands belonging to the broilers and the farmers were
compared.

Data management and statistical analysis

resistance testing was complete,

After
the data were
entered into a computer using Epidata version 2.1 (The
Epidata Association, Odense, Denmark) using a double-
entry validation process followed by data cleaning. The
data set was subsequently analysed using Stata Version 7.0
(Stata Corporation, College Station, Tx, USA) and R
software version 2.4.1 (R development Core Team, R
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

Tables were created to display the prevalence of indi-
vidual resistance, frequency of various multiple resistance
patterns and the numbers of concordant resistance and
DNA ﬁngerprints.

To test whether concordance of resistance pattern took
place beyond chance alone, a ‘‘Monte Carlo’’ simulation
approach was used. Patterns of resistance of individual
E. coli isolate were sorted by species of hosts and farm.
Within the same farm, on same species of host, any pattern
duplicating with an existing one was removed to obtain
unique records by pattern, host species and farm. The total
number of concordant patterns was calculated and taken as
the ‘‘observed pairs of concordance’’. In the simulation
process, records of patterns from the same host species were
reordered at random and consecutively allocated into the
farm. The total number of concordant patterns was calcu-
lated to obtain ‘‘the pairs of concordance from simulation’’.
The sampling process was repeated 10,000 times giving
10,000 pairs of concordance farm simulations. A P-value or
the probability of getting an extreme concordant pair as
much as or beyond the observed value was calculated. We
would reject the null hypothesis that the observed concor-
dance would have occurred purely by chance, if the P-value
(2 sided) is less than 0.05. Finally, contingency tables
between concordance of resistance pattern and of DNA
ﬁngerprint were created. The amount of agreement was
determined using an odds ratio and 95% CI.

resistance was most frequently observed among the isolates
from broilers (87.8%). The prevalence of resistance for
amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone and cefuroxime
was low in both groups. Isolates from broilers were gen-
erally more resistant than those from the farmers. Table 2
shows that half of E. coli isolates from farmers, in contrast
to only 6% of those from broilers, were sensitive to all
agents tested. The highest level of multi-drug resistant of
six combination agents was found in E. coli from broilers.

Pattern of antibiotics resistance from E. coli

From Table 3, there were 35 patterns of resistance. Eigh-
teen patterns were found in isolates from the farmers and
31 patterns in those from the broilers. The ﬁrst ﬁve most
common combinations comprised 51.8% of the resistance
patterns of all isolates.

among the farmers E. coli and 310 among those from the
broilers. Thirty-three farms had at least one concordance
pair. The observed number of pairs of concordance was 44.

Results of simulation

The 10,000 simulated samples gave a mean and standard
deviation of pairs of concordance of 34.6 and 4.4, respec-
tively, with a distribution resembling a normal distribution
(Fig. 1). For a one-sided analysis, 134 simulation records
gave 44 pairs or higher giving a P-value of 0.016. On the
low end, the number of records within the concordance of

25 pairs (equidistant from the mean as those as the high
extreme) was 178. Combining these and the afore-
mentioned high end gave a two-sided P-value of 0.032,
thus rejecting the hypothesis that the observed concordance
occurred by chance alone.

The concordance of DNA ﬁngerprint in E. coli

Nine of the 44 observed concordant pairs were actually
fully sensitive to all antibiotics tested. Of the remaining 35
concordant pairs with at least one antibiotic resistance,
only four had a concordant DNA ﬁngerprint. Two of these
four were mono resistant to doxycycline. The other two
were resistant
to the combination of doxycycline and
nalidixic acid.

On the other hand, there were 20 farms with concordance
DNA ﬁngerprint but different resistance pattern with same
ﬁngerprint matched set. Table 4 summarizes the relationship
between concordance of DNA ﬁngerprint and that of resis-
tance pattern. There was no evidence of association between
the two concordance assessment techniques.

Discussion

Antibiotic resistance is common among study E. coli from
both species of hosts. The prevalence and the level of
multiple drug resistance are more serious among the iso-
lates from the broilers than those from the farmers. With
eight common antibiotics tested, identical antibiotic resis-
tance pattern was found in a quarter of isolates from the 44
matched sets. Observed concordance was signiﬁcantly
higher than by chance alone. Sharing both phenotype and
genotype pattern was rare (4.2%). Concordance of pattern
by both methods has no association with each other.

E. coli

isolates from broilers in our study clearly
exhibited a higher resistance rate than those from farmer.
While antibiotic use was heavy among broilers, only
farmer who had not taken antibiotic within the previous
2 months were selected for our study. The difference in
prevalence of resistance might be explained by this dif-
ference in selection criteria of antibiotic exposure. Lower
levels of exposure to antibiotics in the farmers increase the
likelihood that the transmission of an antibiotic resistance
organism would be in a downward direction, i.e. from
broiler to farmer rather than in the opposite direction.

Resistance to antibiotic agents classiﬁed as critically
important for human medicine (WHO 2005), such as cef-
triaxone and amoxicillin/clavulanic, were rare in our study
sample. However, the high prevalence of resistance to
quinolones and doxycycline, which are important agents for
public health control of infectious diseases such as cholera,
ricketsia infection and leptospirosis, are worrisome.

Multi-drug resistance was found in E. coli from farmers
and broiler, but was more frequent in broiler isolates. The
evidence of E. coli resistance to multiple drugs in this study
is not different from those results from other countries
(Al-Ghamdi et al. 1999; Miles et al. 2006; Saenz et al. 2001).
The rate of the identical resistance pattern of E. coli
isolates from humans and animals in the same farm was
more common in our study (26.3%)
than previously
reported (4%) by Nijsten et al. (1996). Most previous
studies failed to consider the explanation of concordance
by chance. Such probability would be high if the number of
antibiotics tested is small or the prevalence of full sensi-
tivity is high. With eight agents of antibiotic tested and the
prevalence of full sensitivity being 50.3 and 6.1% in E. coli
from farmers and broilers, our simulation shows that there
was an average of 34.6 concordant pairs out of 95 farms
being tested. Thus concordance by chance should never be
ignored. However, in our study population, the concor-
dance of the resistance pattern was not caused by chance
alone.

Our identical ﬁngerprint pattern across E. coli from the
two types of hosts of 25.3% were more common than that
in previous studies (Stobberingh et al. 1999; van den

Bogaard et al. 2001, 2002), with all had small sample sizes.
With internal inconsistency between results from our two
methods, clonal spread, although was possible in four
incidence, was not the main mechanism for multiple-drug
resistance transmission in our study sample.

While we could reject the hypothesis of concordance by
chance and could prove that clonal spread plays very little
role, if any, yet the mechanisms of plasmid conjugation and
transposon transfer need to be further examined for these
isolates. Additionally, concordance in the same farm may
be the result of co-evolution, i.e. exposure to the same
antibiotics in the same farm environment. This would need
further investigation.
