Abstract: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and clonal typing of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-
producing Escherichia coli in healthy broilers in Turkey. Three hundred broiler cloacal samples were collected from various broiler 
slaughterhouses and inoculated on Levine agar plates supplemented with 2 µg/mL cefotaxime. Suspected strains were identified using 
a BBL Crystal Enteric/Nonfermenter ID Kit (Becton Dickinson, USA) and ESBL production was confirmed using an ESBL phenotypic 
confirmatory test. ESBL types were analyzed using PCR and sequencing. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed with 
XbaI for the clonal typing of ESBL-producing E. coli isolates. While 33 phenotypic ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were identified, eight 
of them had only the blaTEM-1. Twenty-five ESBL-producing isolates were detected. This research is the first on the investigation and 
detection of ESBL-producing E. coli isolates from broilers in Turkey. In this study, 8.3% ESBL-producing E. coli were isolated from the 
cloacal samples of broilers collected from slaughterhouses in Turkey. CTX-M-15 (80%) was the most frequently isolated ESBL type. 
Using PFGE analysis, it was determined that these isolates had clonal similarity. 

1. Introduction
Escherichia coli strains are important pathogens in animals 
and  humans,  and  are  normal  commensals  in  intestinal 
tracts. The β-lactam group of antibiotics has been intensely 
used  in  human  and  veterinary  medicine  as  infectious 
disease 
(1).  Extended-spectrum  beta-
lactamases  (ESBLs)  hydrolyze  oxyimino-cephalosporins 
and  give  resistance  to  bacteria  against  the  penicillins, 
cephalosporins (first, second, and third generations), and 
aztreonam. They are repressed by β-lactamase inhibitors. 
ESBLs  are  classified  as  β-lactamases  containing  three 
main families: TEM (named after the patient Temoneria), 
SHV (sulfhydryl reagent variable), and CTX-M (active on 
cefotaxime, first isolated in Munich) (2). The prevalence of 
CTX-M-type β-lactamase-producing E. coli has increased 
in poultry over the last decade (3). 

Increasing  prevalence  of  ESBL-producing  E.  coli  in 
poultry  has  become  a  major  zoonotic  risk  because  of 
possible  transmission  from  broilers  to  humans  (3).  In

addition,  ESBL-producing  E.  coli  strains  that  may  have 
multidrug  resistance  (MDR)  and  cause  therapeutic 
problems  have  been  reported  in  human  and  veterinary 
practice  (4).  The  alarming  spread  of  ESBL-producing 
Enterobacteriaceae poses a serious public health threat and 
has attracted the attention of scientists, politicians, and the 
general public globally. There was no previous study about 
the presence, prevalence, and molecular epidemiology of 
ESBL-producing  E.  coli  isolates  from  broilers  in  Turkey. 
The  aim  of  the  present  study  was  to  investigate  the 
resistance  phenotype  and  genotyping  characteristics  of 
ESBL-carrying E. coli strains in healthy broilers in Turkey. 

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Samples, isolations, and identification
From January to April 2012, 300 samples were collected 
from  cloacal  samples  of  healthy  slaughterhouse  broilers 
in  two  regions  of  Turkey.  Broiler  cloacal  samples  were 
obtained  from  a  total  of  30  different  poultry  houses 

from  three  integrated  firms  (two  firms  in  the  Aegean 
region: 200 samples, one firm in the Black Sea region: 100 
samples). Swab samples in Cary Blair transport medium 
was  brought  to  the  laboratory  under  cold  chain.  Each 
cloacal swab sample was inoculated on Levine agar plates 
supplemented with 2 µg/mL cefotaxime (Sigma, USA) and 
incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. One typical colony showing 
E.coli  morphology  per  plate  was  selected  and  identified 
by  conventional  methods  (Gram  staining,  morphology, 
catalase,  oxidase,  indole,  urease,  methyl  red,  Voges-
Proskauer,  and  citrate)  (5)  and  confirmed  using  a  BBL 
Crystal Enteric/Nonfermenter ID Kit (Becton Dickinson, 
USA).
2.2. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using the 
Kirby-Bauer  disk  diffusion  method  on  Mueller-Hinton 
agar (Merck, Germany), and the results were interpreted 
according  to  the  Clinical  Laboratory  Standards  Institute 
Guidelines  (CLSI)  (6).  E.  coli  isolates  were  tested  for 
resistance  agents.  The  16  antimicrobial  agents  were 
ampicillin  (AM,  10  µg),  amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid 
(AMC, 20 + 10 µg), ceftazidime (CAZ 30 µg), cefotaxime 
(CTX, 30 µg), cefoxitin (FOX, 30 µg), aztreonam (ATM, 
30  µg),  imipenem  (IPM,  10  µg),  gentamicin  (GM, 
10  µg),  tobramycin  (NN,  10  µg),  amikacin  (AN,  30 
µg),  streptomycin  (S,  10  µg),  tetracycline  (TE,  30  µg), 
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole  (SXT,  12.5  +  23.75  µg), 
nalidixic acid (NA, 30 µg), ciprofloxacin (CIP, 5 µg), and 
chloramphenicol (C, 30 µg). E. coli ATCC 25922 was used 
as  an  internal  quality  control  strain  for  antimicrobial 
susceptibility testing. 
2.3. ESBL phenotypic confirmatory tests
A ≥5 mm increase in the inhibition zone diameter for either 
cefotaxime/clavulanic acid or ceftazidime/clavulanic acid 
tested versus its zone when tested alone was considered as 
the phenotypic confirmation test for ESBL production (6).

2.4. Characterization of ESBL genes
Randomly  choosing  a  colony  from  each  cloacal  sample, 
blaCTX-M (CTX-M groups 1, 8, 9, and 10), blaTEM, blaOXA-1, 
blaFOX, blaCMY, blaSHV, and ampC beta lactamase genes were 
studied  using  PCR  (7,8).  All  obtained  amplicons  were 
sequenced on both strands, and sequences were compared 
with those included in the GenBank database and on the 
website http:/www.lahey.org/Studies/ to identify the beta-
lactamase genes.
2.5. PFGE patterns of E. coli isolates producing ESBL
The  clonal  relationship  between  the  strains  was  studied 
by PFGE, using XbaI as a restriction enzyme (9). PFGE 
patterns  were  analyzed  with  BioMumerics  software.  The 
results were discussed according to the criteria given by 
Tenover et al. (10). 

3. Results
The results demonstrated that decreasing susceptibility for 
cefotaxime to E. coli isolates was detected in 101 of the 300 
healthy broiler cloacal samples of our study, representing 
33.6% of the total samples. A phenotypic confirmation test 
for detection of ESBL-producing isolates was carried out 
and 33 (11%) of all samples were determined to produce 
ESBL.  Thirty-three  phenotypic  ESBL-producing  E.  coli 
isolates were further analyzed to examine the presence of 
beta-lactamase genes blaCTX-M (CTX-M groups 1, 8, 9, 
and 10), blaTEM, blaOXA-1, blaFOX, blaCMY, blaSHV, 
and ampC beta-lactamases and sequencing. Eight of the 
33 E. coli isolates were designated as only harboring the 
blaTEM-1 gene. However, the blaCMY gene was not detected 
by PCR in these isolates. TEM-1, SHV-1, and OXA-type 
β-lactamases  have  been  frequently  described  as  broad-
spectrum  β-lactamases.  It  was  observed  that  25  isolates 
had  ESBL  genes.  The  25  ESBL-producing  isolates  were 
detected as 23 CTX-M (92%) (20 CTX-M-15, 1 CTX-M-1, 
1 CTX-M-9, 1 CTX-M-16), 4 OXA-1 (16%), and 2 SHV-
12 (8%) (Table 1).

ÜNAL et al. / Turk J Vet Anim SciThe  25  ESBL-producing  E.  coli  isolates  were  tested 
against  16  antimicrobial  agents  using  the  disk  diffusion 
method.  All  isolates  were  determined  to  be  resistant 
against  multiple  antibiotics  (at 
least  six  antibiotic-
resistant).  The  prevalence  of  antibiotic  resistance  of 
ESBL-positive  E.  coli  isolates  to  ampicillin,  amoxicillin/
clavulanic  acid,  cefotaxime,  ceftazidime,  aztreonam,

and 80% (20), respectively. All of the ESBL E. coli isolates 
were susceptible to cefoxitin and imipenem.

According to a similarity rate of 85% or over, 25 isolates 
was  divided  into  two  main  groups,  namely  A  and  B,  by 
PFGE  analysis.  Main  group  A  contained  A1  (6  isolates) 
and  A2  (6  isolates),  while  main  group  B  involved  B1  (3 
isolates) and B2 (10 isolates) (Figure; Table 1). The PFGE 
analysis illustrating the distribution of ESBL-producing E. 
coli is presented in Table 2.

4. Discussion
This subject has gained importance due to the idiopathic 
increase  in  ESBL-producing  E.  coli  prevalence  among 
healthy  farm  animals,  especially 
in  poultry.  ESBL-
producing E. coli of poultry origin is a zoonotic risk factor 
for humans, as it could be directly or indirectly transmitted 
to humans and the environment by poultry breeding and 
products.

It  has  been  reported  that  the  prevalence  of  ESBL-
producing E. coli in healthy broilers was 3.6% in Britain 
(11), 10.7% in France (12), 38.2% in Portugal (13), 45% 
in  Belgium  (1),  and  60.8%  in  China  (14).  There  has 
been  no  research  on  antibiotic  resistance  phenotypes 
and  genotyping  characteristics  of  ESBL-carrying  E.  coli 
strains in healthy broilers in Turkey. In the present study, 
which was the first report in Turkey (25/300) about ESBL-
producing  E.  coli  prevalence  among  healthy  broilers, 
it  was  detected  as  8.3%.  Differences  in  prevalence  of 
ESBL-producing  E.  coli  among  various  countries  could 
result from antimicrobial use policies relating to poultry. 
In  addition,  the  results  reported  by  Dierikx  et  al.  (15) 
demonstrated  that  the  prevalence  of  ESBL-producing  E. 
coli in the Netherlands varied between 0% and 100% in the 
poultry  production  pyramid  during  all  stages:  0%–24% 
in  2-day-old  chicks,  96%–100%  in  18-week-old  pullets, 
and 100% in 31-week-old hens. According to the results 
of that study (15), there was no correlation between the 
increasing prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli and the 
use of antimicrobial agents in poultry; this situation could 
occur by vertical–horizontal transmission.

as 
cefotaxime  and  ceftazidime  (16).  ESBL  type  CTX-M 
group  are  the  most  common  currently,  although  SHV 
or TEM were common in the past (2). The genes coding 
CTX-M group β-lactamase are harbored by plasmids as IS 
Ecp1. After determining the presence and transmitting by 
conjugation of ESBL type CTX-M groups in healthy food-
producing  animals,  this  issue  has  become  increasingly 
important (12,17). 

The first ESBL-producing E. coli (CTX-M-14, SHV-12, 
and CMY-2) in poultry were isolated from healthy chick 
feces in Spain in 2000 and 2001 (7). Recently published 
literature  reported  that  the  most  common  ESBL-type  E. 
coli in healthy poultry were CTX-M-1 in France (12) and 
Britain (11); TEM-1, SHV-12, CTX-M-32, and CTX-M-1 
in Italy (18); and CTX-M groups (CTX-M-14, CTX-M-24,

CTX-M-65)  and  TEM  in  China  (14).  In  other  studies, 
however,  CTX-M-15  type  ESBLs  were  reported  as  the 
most common: Panpan et al. (19) identified that the most 
common type of ESBL in China was the CTX-M-15 gene, 
while  Maciuca  et  al.  (20)  conducted  a  study  in  poultry 
and people in Romania, reporting that the most common 
type  in  clinical  isolates  was  also  the  CTX-M-15  gene. 
Results from the present study, indicating that the highest 
prevalence for ESBL types was the CTX-M-15 gene, were 
consistent with the newly published research (19,20). This 
result was also similar to findings in the study on human 
medicine by Gür et al. (21).

In conclusion, from broiler cloacal samples collected 
from slaughterhouses in Turkey, 8.3% ESBL-producing E. 
coli  were  isolated.  These  isolates  had  multiple  antibiotic 
resistance.  CTX-M-15  (80%)  was  the  most  frequently 
isolated ESBL type. Twenty-five isolates were divided into 
two main groups, namely A and B, by PFGE analysis. It 
was determined that these isolates had clonal similarity by 
PFGE analysis.
