ABSTRACT

The  objectives  of  this  study  were  to  characterize 
Staphylococcus  aureus  isolated  from  artisanal  and  in-
dustrialized  Minas  frescal  cheeses,  to  determine  their 
antimicrobial  susceptibility  profile  as  well  as  the  ge-
netic  similarity  among  the  isolates.  The  isolates  were 
also  tested  for  staphylococcal  enterotoxin  genes  and 
other  virulence  factors.  Fifty-six  artisanal  raw  milk 
cheeses sold at street fairs and 10 industrialized cheeses 
commercialized  in  supermarkets  of  Goiânia,  Goiás, 
were analyzed. Staphylococcus aureus was confirmed in 
19 samples (33.9%) of artisanal cheese by detection of 
femA gene, in which 29 isolates were obtained. These 
isolates were submitted to the antimicrobial suscepti-
bility test and classified into 9 different profiles (A–I). 
Thirteen  isolates  (44.8)  were  resistant  to  penicillin 
and 3 (10.3) to tetracycline, with 2 (7.4) resistant to 
both.  The  multiplex  PCR  technique  was  performed 
to detect virulence genes that code for the production 
of  hemolysins  (Hla  and  Hlb),  toxic  shock  syndrome 
toxin (TSST-1), exfoliative toxins (ETa and ETb), and 
staphylococcal enterotoxins [SE; SEA–SEE, SEG–SEJ, 
SEM–SEO]. All the isolates amplified for the hla gene 
and 14 (48.3%) for the hlb gene. The seh gene was the 
most frequently detected (n = 11, 37.9%), followed by 
seo gene (n = 3; 10.3%). In one isolate (3.4%), 4 entero-
toxins  genes  were  detected,  and  in  another,  6  (3.4%) 
were  detected.  The  comparison  performed  by  pulsed-
field gel electrophoresis of the 29 isolates revealed 18 
genotypic profiles, which were grouped into 5 clusters. 
The  genotyping  found  high  genetic  similarity  among 
the isolates. Identical isolates were obtained from dif-
ferent samples and one sample showed more than one 
genetically different isolate. The high prevalence of S. 
aureus in the Minas Frescal cheese samples, as well as 
the detection of toxin encoding genes identified in this 
study, warns of the necessity to reduce the contamina-

INTRODUCTION

 

Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most important 
human  and  animal  pathogens.  It  has  a  broad  set  of 
virulence mechanisms associated with infectivity, pro-
duction of toxins, and antimicrobial resistance (Argu-
din et al., 2010).

Some  strains  of  S.  aureus  can  produce  toxins  that 
are  members  of  pyrogenic  toxin  superantigen  family, 
such as the staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin 
(TSST-1), which is responsible for generating an im-
mune hyper-response in the host and has already been 
detected in S. aureus isolated from foods (Cha et al., 
2007).  These  bacteria  can  produce  exfoliative  toxins, 
which promote the cleavage of the skin extract, caus-
ing severe cutaneous syndromes (Zschöck et al., 2005). 
Most  strains  secrete  enzymes  and  cytotoxins  that  in-
clude coagulase and 4 hemolysins (α, β, gamma, and 
delta).  Alpha  and  β  hemolysins  (Hla  and  Hlb)  are 
dermonecrotic and neurotoxic, turn off the immune sys-
tem by direct cytotoxic effect, and degrade soft tissues 
(Vandenesch et al., 2012).

Among the toxins produced by S. aureus, staphylococ-
cal enterotoxins are a concern, because when produced 
in  foods  staphylococcal  enterotoxins  can  cause  food 
poisoning, which is one of the most prevalent foodborne 
diseases around the world (ECDC, 2015). These toxins 
present emetic activity and are called classic staphylo-
coccal enterotoxins (SE; SEA–SEE), which occur more 
frequently  in  cases  and  outbreaks  of  food  poisoning, 
along with other more recently identified (SEG, SEH, 
SEI, SER, and SET (Wallin-Carlquist et al., 2010; Xu 
and  McCormick,  2012).  In  addition  to  these,  other 
enterotoxins called staphylococcal enterotoxin-like pro-
teins (SEl) include the SEl J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, 
U, and V. Although the SEl toxins are homologous and 
structurally similar to the staphylococcal enterotoxins,

emesis activity has not yet been confirmed in humans 
(Xu and McCormick, 2012).

Staphylococcus aureus was the second most common 
pathogen  responsible  for  foodborne  diseases  in  Brazil 
between 2000 and 2014. Milk and its derivatives were 
among the foods most frequently involved in outbreaks 
of foodborne diseases (ANVISA, 2015).

Minas  frescal  cheese  is  one  of  the  most  consumed 
cheeses  in  Brazil  and  presents  high  susceptibility  to 
microbiological and proteolytic changes due to its high 
moisture  content  and  handling  (Chalita  et  al.,  2009). 
According  to  Brazilian  law,  this  type  of  cheese  must 
be produced in dairy industry with pasteurized milk. 
However, this food is also manufactured from raw milk 
and  marketed  in  the  informal  sector,  without  regula-
tion and sanitary supervision. For these reasons, it is 
frequently  involved  in  the  transmission  of  pathogenic 
bacteria  and  staphylococcal  food  poisoning  outbreaks 
(Dorigon, 2010).

Additionally, bacteria isolated from foods of animal 
origin  may  show  resistance  to  several  antimicrobial 
agents used to treat diseases, which may influence the 
effectiveness for treatment (Delsol et al., 2010; Araújo 
et al., 2011).

The aims of the study were to (1) evaluate the preva-
lence of S. aureus in artisanal and industrialized Minas 
frescal  cheese  sold  in  the  municipality  of  Goiânia, 
Brazil;  (2)  determine  the  antimicrobial  susceptibility 
profile of the isolates; (3) molecularly characterize the 
isolates for the presence of virulence genes and genetic 
similarity  by  macrorestriction  analysis  using  pulsed-
field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cheese Sampling

In  this  study,  56  artisanal  and  10  industrialized 
samples of Minas frescal cheese were purchased from re-
tail sale sites along the market streets and from super-
markets,  respectively,  in  the  municipality  of  Goiânia, 
Goiás, Brazil, from June to August 2012. All samples 
were immediately transported to the laboratory in a re-
frigerated box (4 to 8°C) and kept at 4°C until analysis.

Isolation of Coagulase-Positive Staphylococci

To 

enumerate 

coagulase-positive 

staphylococci 
(CPS), the samples were processed by surface plating 
on Baird-Parker agar with egg yolk tellurite emulsion 
and  incubated  at  37°C  for  48  h  under  aerobic  condi-
tions. Up to 5 typical or atypical (or both) presumptive 
colonies were selected and tested using standard micro-

Journal of Dairy Science Vol. 99 No. 11, 2016

biological procedures such as Gram staining, catalase, 
and  thermostable  nuclease  detection.  The  coagulase 
production  was  performed  by  tube  test  using  rabbit 
serum  (Bennett  and  Lancette,  2001).  A  pure  culture 
of  each  isolate  was  kept  frozen  at  −80°C  for  further 
analysis.

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test–Disk  
Diffusion Method

All  CPS  isolates  were  subjected  to  an  antimicro-
bial  susceptibility  test  by  the  disc  diffusion  method 
on  Müeller  Hinton  agar  (CLSI,  2015).  Penicillin  (10 
UI), cefoxitin (30 µg), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 
(1.25/23.75 µg), rifampin (5 µg), ciprofloxacin (5 µg), 
tetracycline (30 µg), erythromycin (15 µg), quinupris-
tin/dalfopristin (15 µg), and clindamycin (2 µg) were 
used  as  antimicrobial  agents.  Staphylococcus  aureus 
ATCC 25923 was used as a reference strain for antimi-
crobial susceptibility testing.

DNA Extraction

The  DNA  extraction  procedure  was  performed  ac-
cording to Aires-de-Sousa et al. (2007). The pure cul-
ture was thawed and streaked onto Tryptone Soya Agar 
culture  and  incubated  at  35°C  for  18  to  24  h.  Three 
to 4 colonies were suspended in 50 µL of TE 1× buf-
fer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) with 1 µL of 
lysostaphin (10 mg/mL) and incubated at 37°C. After 
30 min, cell suspensions were placed in a boiling-water 
bath at 95°C for 15 min. Then, 150 µL of H2O Milli-Q 
was added and the solution was centrifuged (13,000 × 
g) for 5 min at 4°C. The resulting supernatants were 
used as DNA templates in the PCR reactions.

Identification of Staphylococcus aureus

The CPS isolates were screened by PCR for the pres-
ence of femA gene, which is specific for S. aureus, accord-
ing to Mehrotra et al. (2000). The primers used for gene 
amplification  were  femA-F:  5′AAAAAAGCACATAA-
CAAGCG  3′  and  femA-R:  5′GATAAAGAAGAAAC-
CAGCAG 3′, to obtain a 132-bp amplicon.

The PCR reaction was performed in a reaction mix-
ture  with  a  final  volume  of  50  µL  containing  10  µL 
of  5×  reaction  buffer  [20  mM  Tris-HCl  (pH  8.4),  50 
mM KCl], 1.5 mM MgCl2, 100 µM of each dNTP, 0.2 
mM of femA primers, 2.5 U of Taq polymerase, and 20 
ng of template DNA. The volume of this mixture was 
adjusted to 50 µL with sterile deionized water. As posi-
tive controls, PCR reactions were carried out in paral-

lel  and  contained  template  DNA  extracted  from  the 
standard strains of S. aureus ATCC 25923. The PCR 
was  performed  under  the  following  conditions:  initial 
denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, subsequently followed 
by 35 cycles at 94°C for 2 min, 57°C for 2 min, and 72°C 
for 1 min, with a final extension of 7 min at 72°C. The 
amplified products were detected by electrophoresis on 
1.5% gel agarose containing ethidium bromide (0.5 µg/
mL). The electrophoresis was carried out at 100 V for 
1  h.  The  PCR  products  were  visually  examined  and 
photographed under UV illumination.

Detection of Virulence Genes

The multiplex PCR technique was performed on all 
S. aureus isolates to detect virulence genes that code 
for the production of hemolysins (Hla and Hlb), TSST-
1, exfoliative toxins (ETa and ETb), and enterotoxins 
(SEA–SEE, SEG–SEJ, SEM–SEO), through 4 sequen-
tial  reactions,  according  to  Jarraud  et  al.  (2002)  and 
Holtfreter  et  al.  (2007)  with  modifications.  All  the 

primer pairs used in this study and the multiplex reac-
tions are listed in Table 1.

The PCR reactions were performed in a total volume 
of 25 µL containing reaction buffer (5×; 10 mM Tris-
HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), 5.0 mM MgCl2, 
100 mM of dNTP, 150 to 400 nM of each primer, 1.0 
U of Taq DNA polymerase, and 10 to 20 ng of DNA 
template.

The PCR samples were subjected to amplification us-
ing a thermocycler (Axygen, Tewksbury, MA) accord-
ing  to  the  following  program:  initial  denaturation  at 
95°C for 15 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation 
at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 56°C for 30 s, 72°C for 50 
s, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. Amplicons 
were separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis in 
1×  Tris-borate-EDTA  (TBE)  at  100  V  for  90  min 
and  viewed  under  Gel  Doc  XR  UV  transilluminator 
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The gel images 
were  analyzed  with  the  QuantityOne  software  (Bio-
Rad Laboratories) after ethidium bromide (0.5 µg/mL) 
staining.

Molecular Subtyping of S. aureus Isolates

FERREIRA ET AL.

S. aureus Identification

Strains identified as S. aureus by PCR were submit-
ted  to  PFGE  using  20  U  of  SmaI  restriction  enzyme 
according to Chung et al. (2000). Electrophoretic run 
was  performed  in  0.5×  TBE  buffer  (90  mM  Tris,  90 
mM boric acid, and 2 mM EDTA) using CHEF DRII 
System  (Bio-Rad  Laboratories,  Hercules,  CA),  under 
the following conditions: 6 V/cm for 22 h, pulse times 
from  5  to  35  s  at  14°C.  Staphylococcus  aureus  strain 
NCTC 8325 was used as the reference standard.

After being run, the gels were stained with ethidium 
bromide  (0.5  µg/mL)  and  viewed  with  a  UV  trans-
illuminator.  Gel  images  were  captured  by  Molecular 
ImagerGelDoc  XR  (Bio-Rad)  and  analyzed  with  the 
BioNumerics  program  (version  5.1;  AppliedMaths, 
Ghent,  Belgium).  Clustering  was  performed  by  un-
weighted pair group method using arithmetic averages. 
Similarity of strains was estimated using the Dice cor-
relation  coefficient  with  0.7%  optimization  and  1.0% 
tolerance setting. For clustering of strains, a cut-off of 
80% was applied (Carriço et al., 2005). Identical PFGE 
profiles  (100%  of  similarity)  were  defined  as  a  pulso-
type.  Gels  were  also  analyzed  by  visual  examination 
of  the  banding  patterns  to  differentiate  between  the 
undistinguishable  closely  related  strains,  which  were 
possibility related or unrelated (Tenover et al., 1995).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Coagulase-Positive Staphylococci

From 10 industrialized Minas frescal cheese samples 
analyzed, 2 (20.0%) presented CPS counts higher than 
the  limits  established  as  maximum  legal  limit  (1.0  × 
103 cfu/g) by Brazilian legislation (Brasil, 2001). The 
artisanal Minas frescal cheese was found to be poten-
tially hazardous to public health because levels of con-
tamination ranged from 1.2 × 103 to 1.5 × 107 cfu/g in 
19 (33.9%) of the evaluated samples. Eight (14.3%) of 
them were higher than 105 cfu/g, presenting a high risk 
of food poisoning (Balaban and Rasooly, 2000).

The presence of CPS in cheeses made from pasteur-
ized  milk  may  indicate  a  failure  in  pasteurization  or 
recontamination after pasteurization due to insufficient 
hygienic and sanitary practices (O’Brien et al., 2009). 
High  counts  of  CPS  in  raw  milk  cheese  are  expected 
because that milk can be contaminated directly from 
the  production  environment,  infected  animal,  or  food 
handler (Spanu et al., 2014). Variable results have been 
observed by other authors in samples obtained in Bra-
zil such as 21.0% in Bahia and 31.2% in Pernambuco 
(Evêncio-Luz et al., 2012) and 54.2% in Goiás (André 
et al., 2008).

Journal of Dairy Science Vol. 99 No. 11, 2016

Of the 19 samples of artisanal and 2 of industrialized 
cheeses  that  were  positive  for  CPS,  29  isolates  were 
identified as S. aureus by phenotypic characterization 
and femA detection. All of these isolates were recovered 
from artisanal cheeses.

The presence of S. aureus in fresh raw milk cheeses 
is a frequent finding around the world, and the preva-
lence varies, for example, 2.2% (Vitale et al., 2015) and 
35.0% (Bianchi et al., 2014) in Italy, 10.9% (Jamali et 
al., 2015) and 45.0% (Saadat et al., 2014) in Iran, 37.5% 
in  Turkey  (Gücükoğlu  et  al.,  2012),  54.2%  in  Brazil 
(André et al., 2008), and 69.0% in Sweden (Rosengren 
et al., 2010). In Switzerland, between 1996 and 2006, 
63.6% of the staphylococcal food poisoning outbreaks 
reported  were  associated  with  cheese  consumption 
(Baumgartner, 2008).

The handmade process in Brazil does not involve the 
step of milk pasteurization, which is very important for 
the quality control and safety of this product. André et 
al. (2008) observed that the main source of contamina-
tion of the final product was the raw milk used in its 
production, compared with strains isolated from han-
dlers in artisanal cheese produced in the Goiás State, 
Brazil.

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Profile

The  resistance  patterns  of  S.  aureus  to  the  tested 
antimicrobial agents are presented in Table 2. The tests 
demonstrated the susceptibility of all S. aureus isolates 
to cefoxitin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, rifampin, 
and erythromycin. Twelve (41.4%) isolates were suscep-
tible to all 9 antimicrobials tested, and 13 (44.8%) and 
3 (10.3%) were resistant to penicillin and tetracycline, 
respectively.  Intermediate  susceptibility  was  observed 
in one isolate (3.4%) for ciprofloxacin and clindamycin 
and in 5 (17.2%) for quinupristin/dalfopristin.

In  this  study,  12  isolates  (41.4%)  were  resistant  to 
1, and 2 isolates (6.9%) were resistant to 2 antimicro-
bial  agents.  The  resistance  to  penicillin  remains  the 
most  common,  as  observed  in  other  studies  (André 
et  al.,  2008;  Spanu  et  al.,  2014;  Jamali  et  al.,  2015). 
The prevalence of resistance to β-lactam antibiotics is 
frequent  in  S.  aureus  strains  obtained  from  milk  and 
related products as reported by Daka et al. (2012), Hu 
et al. (2013), and Xu et al. (2014).

Several  mechanisms  are  involved  in  β-lactam  resis-
tance, such as production of penicillinases or alteration 
of the target protein (Spanu et al., 2014). We did not 
find  any  isolate  resistant  to  cefoxitin,  indicating  that 
the high resistance to penicillin observed should be as 
result of β-lactamase production.

Tetracycline resistance observed in this study (10.3%) 
was also found in Italy by Spanu et al. (2014) in strains 
isolated  from  cheese  (10.6%).  Tetracycline  is  used  in 
intensive livestock production, which may explain the 
resistance  observed  in  the  literature  in  bacteria  ob-
tained  from  animal  products  (Schneider  et  al.,  2009; 
Lee et al., 2014).

According to the patterns generated by the antimi-
crobial susceptibility tests, the 29 isolates were grouped 
into  9  distinct  profiles,  A  to  I  (Table  2).  Profile  A 
grouped 13 isolates (44.8%), and profile B grouped 9 
(31.0%).

Detection of Virulence Genes

Staphylococcus  aureus  groups  are  characterized  by 
different virulence factors and by large variations in the 
presence of these virulence genes (Aydin et al., 2011). 
In this study, the presence of tst, eta, and etb genes was 
not found in the isolates. The hla gene was found in all 
isolates, and hlb gene was found in 14 (48.3%) of them 
(Table 3). Silva et al. (2012) also found 100.0% of he-
molytic activity among S. aureus isolated from bovine 
mastitis and most of them presented co-production of 
toxins.

According to Lo et al. (2011), the cytolysin produc-
tion, including hemolysins, determines the pathogenic-
ity  of  several  bacterial  agents  and  is  associated  with 

the pathogenesis of diseases caused by S. aureus. The 
hemolysins can be produced by the most S. aureus iso-
lates (Burnside et al., 2010).

The synergistic effect between α and β hemolysins is 
recognized as a determinant of the severity of S. aureus 
diseases, particularly bovine mastitis, with great abil-
ity of the pathogen to persist in the mammary gland, 
which  may  contaminate  the  milk  and  milk  products 
(Aarestrup  et  al.,  1999).  The  Hlb  is  characteristic  of 
isolates obtained from bovine mammary gland; there-
fore, the findings suggest the probable source of cheeses 
contamination evaluated in this study.

From  29  S.  aureus  isolates,  13  (44.8%)  presented 
genes  coding  for  enterotoxins.  The  seh  gene  was  the 
most frequently detected (n = 11, 37.9%), followed by 
the seo gene (n = 3; 10.3%), seg, sem, sen genes (n = 2; 
6.9%), and sec, sei genes (n = 1; 3.4%). In one isolate 
(3.4%), 4 genes coding for SEG and SEl M, N, and O 
were detected. In another isolate (3.4%), 6 genes were 
present  (staphylococcal  enterotoxins  C,  G,  I  and  SEl 
M,  N,  O).  Both  the  isolates  were  obtained  from  the 
same artisanal raw milk cheese (Table 3).

The identification of new staphylococcal enterotoxins 
and SEl greatly increases the frequency of enterotoxi-
genic  S.  aureus  isolates,  which  suggests  an  improve-
ment on pathogenic potential of this bacteria (Bianchi 
et  al.,  2014).  Among  the  staphylococcal  enterotoxins, 
SEH has been responsible for staphylococcal food poi-

soning involving milk products (Jørgensen et al., 2005; 
Ostyn  et  al.,  2010).  Ikeda  et  al.  (2005)  described  an 
outbreak due to the consumption of reconstituted milk, 
which was contaminated with enterotoxigenic S. aureus 
producing SEA and SEH. Another outbreak was attrib-
uted to SEH produced by S. aureus in mashed potatoes 
made with raw milk (Jørgensen et al., 2005).

The SEH has been described as the most prevalent 
staphylococcal  enterotoxin  in  bovine  milk.  Liu  et  al. 
(2014), who analyzed 116 isolates from bovine mastitis, 
detected the seh gene in 36.3% and sec gene in 3.4% 
isolates. This is similar to the results obtained in the 
present  study,  and  reinforces  the  possible  source  of 
cheese contamination. Bianchi et al. (2014) evaluating 
milk  products  found  genes  sea,  sed,  and  sec  in  23.1, 
47.0, and 12.9% of the isolates, respectively, as well as 
the genes seg, seh, sei, sej, sep, and ser in 33.3, 4.7, 34.5, 
46.7, 1.17, and 52.5%, respectively.

Several studies focused on the detection of genes cod-
ing  classical  staphylococcal  enterotoxins  (SEA–SEE). 
In those studies, the major prevalence was observed for 
the sea gene, although at low percentages such as 12.8% 
(Spanu et al., 2014), 5.0% (Saadat et al., 2014), 4.8% 
(Gücükoğlu  et  al.,  2012),  2.2%  (Vitale  et  al.,  2015), 
and 1.6% (Ertas et al., 2010). Our study expanded the 
investigation for 7 more staphylococcal enterotoxins or 
SEl (G, H, I, J, M, N, O), and we observed that only 
sec gene among the classical staphylococcal enterotox-
ins was detected in 3.4% of the cheese samples. This 
fact demonstrates the importance of searching for other 
staphylococcal enterotoxins, especially in S. aureus ob-
tained from food samples.

The presence of enterotoxins in milk products is con-
sidered a potential risk to public health. Several factors 
such  as  processing  failures,  inadequate  refrigeration, 
improper  hygienic  practices,  and  contamination  after 
processing  are  associated  with  S.  aureus  multiplica-
tion and enterotoxin production (Saadat et al., 2014). 
Therefore,  the  establishment  and  implementation  of 
safety regulations is essential to prevent staphylococcal 
food poisoning.

supplier in different street fairs. André et al. (2008) and 
Tondo et al. (2000) found more diversity among isolates 
obtained from dairy products in the Middle West and 
Southern Brazil.

We observed that some samples (Q3, Q9, Q15, Q18, 
Q24,  Q35)  presented  more  than  one  genetically  dis-
tinct  isolate,  and  genetically  identical  isolates  (100% 
similarity)  were  obtained  from  different  samples.  As 
demonstrated in Figure 1, one sample (Q35) contained 
4 isolates that, although grouped in the same cluster, 
presented  distinct  pulsotypes,  different  susceptibility, 
or  different  virulence  profile.  This  observation  shows 
that during the cheese production chain, contamination 
could occur from several sources in the milk and cheese 
production  environment,  as  well  as  from  the  animal 
or  food  handler  (Spanu  et  al.,  2014).  This  could  be 
minimized if hygienic processing was intensified to pre-
vent cross-contamination among the potential sources 
of food contamination.

All  11  S.  aureus  isolates  harboring  the  seh  gene, 
obtained  from  10  different  samples,  were  grouped  in 
cluster  1,  which  demonstrates  high  similarity  among 
these  isolates,  although  they  were  isolated  from  sam-
ples produced in distinct places at different times. The 
genes coding for other staphylococcal enterotoxins (C, 
G,  I,  M,  N,  O),  detected  in  2  isolates  obtained  from 
the same sample, were grouped in cluster 3 with 92.7% 
similarity. It has been demonstrated that the seh gene 
is the most prevalent in S. aureus isolates from bovine 
mastitis (Liu et al., 2014). The present study found the 
seh gene in 37.9% of the S. aureus isolated from raw 
milk cheeses, which indicates the most probable source 
of the bacteria for the product was the bovine milk.

The  association  of  distinct  molecular  typing  tech-
niques is helpful to improve the knowledge about the 
dynamics of infections caused by S. aureus. The com-
bination of PFGE with PCR is an important tool for 
epidemiological diagnosis as well as to understand the 
patterns of pathogen transmission and sources of pos-
sible food contamination (Said et al., 2010).

Molecular Subtyping of S. aureus

The comparison of the 29 S. aureus isolated during 
the study were performed by PFGE. The isolates were 
assigned to 18 pulsotypes and grouped into 5 clusters 
(each cluster grouped 2 or more isolates with ≥80% of 
similarity; Figure 1). Cluster 1 grouped 20 isolates ob-
tained from 13 different raw milk cheese samples. The 
other 4 clusters grouped 2 isolates each, and one isolate 
was not related to any cluster. This shows high genetic 
similarity  among  the  isolates.  This  similarity  can  be 
explained by a possible sale of products from the same

CONCLUSIONS

The presence of S. aureus above the limit established 
by  law  and  at  levels  compatible  with  the  production 
of enterotoxins in artisanal raw milk cheeses points to 
the potential risk to public health. Consumption of this 
product is still widespread in Brazil; therefore, an effec-
tive reduction of contamination levels could be achieved 
by improving sanitation and hygiene procedures. The 
consumption  of  artisanal  raw  milk  cheese  should  be 
considered a potential risk of foodborne disease because 
genes coding for enterotoxin production were detected. 
The identification of enterotoxins, other than the classic

ones, highlights the importance of expanding research 
to detect these virulence factors for food safety assur-
ance.  The  combination  of  genotypic  and  phenotypic 
methods used helps to trace the origin of the strains. 
The virulence pattern observed in most of the isolates 
led us to conclude that the contamination of traditional 
and artisanal raw milk cheese with S. aureus, despite 
the handmade production, is probably of animal origin. 
Therefore, milk pasteurization, as recommended by the 
supervisory agencies, should solve most of the problem.
