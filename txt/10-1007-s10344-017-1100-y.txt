Abstract Due to limited data available on the presence of
antibiotic-resistant (ABR) bacteria in faeces of wild herbi-
vores in South Africa, this study analysed resistance patterns
for Escherichia coli isolates from wildebeest, zebra and gi-
raffe in addition to pet and farm pig faeces. Total and faecal
coliforms and E. coli were quantified in faecal matter using a
most probable number (MPN) guideline procedure. Antibiotic
resistance profiles against 12 selected antibiotics representing
seven classes were determined for 30 randomly selected E.
coli isolates from each animal using the European Committee
on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) disk dif-
fusion procedure. While log10 MPN values per gram of animal
faeces for total/faecal coliforms ranged from 4.51/4.11 to
5.70/5.50, the E. coli MPN values were in a range of 3.43–
5.14. The proportion of ABR E. coli isolates ranged from 43%
(giraffe) to 93% (zebra). About 47% of E. coli isolates from
zebra faeces were categorized as multidrug-resistant (MDR),
while for wildebeest and giraffe, no MDR isolates were de-
tected. In comparison, 10% of E. coli isolates from pet pig and
about 7% from farm pig faeces were categorized as MDR.
Although most MDR isolates were resistant to at least one
β-lactam antibiotic, only one MDR isolate from farm pig fae-
ces was resistant to both norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, the
two fluoroquinolones tested. However, no resistance was de-
tected to the tested carbapenems and tigecycline. The results

of this study indicate that indigenous South African herbi-
vores may serve as potential reservoirs and vectors for the
dissemination of ABR E. coli strains.

Introduction

The extensive use of antibiotic compounds in human and vet-
erinary medicine has led to the presence of antibiotic residues
in food and the environment (Welch 1957; Kümmerer 2003;
Kemper 2008; Martinez 2009). Consequently, recent research
has focused on the transfer and detection of antibiotic-resistant
microorganisms and their genes in the environment (Sørum
and L’Abée-Lund 2002; Garcia-Alvarez et al. 2012). Only
recently, the World Health Organization (WHO), the
European Food and Safety Authority (EFSA) and even the
President of the USA highlighted antibiotic resistance as a
serious global health problem (White House 2014; WHO
2014; EFSA 2017). As zoonotic bacteria can acquire resis-
tance to antibiotics typically utilized in human and veterinary
medicine, farm animals can serve as a potential reservoir for
antibiotic-resistant (ABR) bacterial strains as well as potential
vectors for transferring such resistant bacteria or their genes
into the environment (Sørum and L’Abée-Lund 2002;
Silbergeld et al. 2008; EFSA 2017). Zoonotic bacteria present-
ing resistance to antibiotics critical in human medicine such as
fluoroquinolones and third and fourth generation cephalospo-
rins are of particular concern, as they may compromise the
effective treatment of infections in humans (Hammerum and
Heuer 2009; WHO 2016). Humans can acquire infections
with such antibiotic-resistant zoonotic bacteria either via

contact with animals or through ingestion of contaminated
food products of animal and non-animal origin.

Escherichia coli is an intestinal bacterium commonly asso-
ciated with the digestive system of animals and therefore con-
sidered a useful hygiene indicator (Leclerc et al. 2001).
However, pathogenic strains of E. coli can be a serious threat
to public health as was observed in 2011 and 2016, when
Shiga-toxin-producing strains of E. coli caused outbreaks in
European countries, ultimately attributed to the consumption
of sprouts made from contaminated fenugreek seeds (EFSA
2011) and soft cheese (Peron et al. 2016). The pathogenic
E. coli strain causing the 2011 outbreak exhibited multidrug
resistance against ampicillin, ceftriaxone, streptomycin and
tetracycline (King et al. 2012), further highlighting the prob-
lem of multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli.

Antibiotic usage in the diets of food animals as prophylac-
tic or therapeutic means can promote the horizontal transfer of
antibiotic resistance genes (Silbergeld et al. 2008; Wellington
et al. 2013), which might even take place in the absence of
selective pressure imposed by the use of antibiotics (Allen
et al. 2010). Human-livestock contact taking place in rural
areas in developing countries might promote exposure to
and transfer of such zoonotic bacteria due to the close contact
between the population and livestock (Rwego et al. 2008;
Klous et al. 2016). Additionally, studies in South Africa by
Schellack et al. (2011) indicated that social issues including
widespread poverty and lack of access to safe potable water
and proper sanitation might stimulate the dissemination of
MDR bacterial strains. However, ABR bacteria are even
found in the faeces of wild animals, ranging from primates
(Rolland et al. 1985) and rodents (Guenther et al. 2010) to
wild boars (Literak et al. 2010) and various wild birds
(Costa et al. 2008), with even extended spectrum β-
lactamase (ESBL) containing E. coli being detected (Literak
et al. 2010). It was assumed that the presence of such ABR
bacteria is most likely due to anthropogenic activities or con-
tact with anthropogenic waste material; for example, seagulls
that scavenge food wastes (Cole et al. 2005; Radhouani et al.
2009) or wild baboons feeding on human refuse (Rolland et al.
1985). The ribotyping patterns of the majority of E. coli iso-
lates from seagulls in New Hampshire (USA) had a ≥90%
similarity to those of E. coli strains isolated from proximate
wastewater treatment plants and landfill sites (Nelson et al.
2008), suggesting a potential for transfer of faecal bacteria to
recreational areas frequented by humans. Moreover, consider-
ing the ability of long distance migration, birds can act as
efficient transporters for the dissemination of antibiotic-
resistant bacteria and mirror the spectrum of such bacteria
found in humans and human waste materials (Radhouani
et al. 2009).

Antibiotic resistance profiles of E. coli isolates from vari-
ous African wild animals—ranging from buffalo, eland and
primates to the smaller mongoose and warthog—have been

reported (Rolland et al. 1985; Skurnik et al. 2006; Pesapane
et al. 2013; Jobbins and Alexander 2015; Katakweba et al.
2015). However, to the best of our knowledge, no information
on the resistance profiles of E. coli from the three herbivores
zebra, giraffe and wildebeest is available for KwaZulu-Natal,
South Africa. To estimate the extent of antibiotic resistance
among bacteria associated with these herbivores, which might
serve as potential reservoirs and vectors, surveillance is nec-
essary. Therefore, this study reports initial screening data
pertaining to antibiotic resistance profiles of E. coli isolates
from the three selected indigenous herbivores zebra, giraffe
and wildebeest, in comparison to farm and pet pig.

Materials and methods

Sample collection

Faecal samples (pooled from at least three faecal samples per
animal) of giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), zebra (Equus
burchellii) and wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) were ob-
tained from the Bisley Valley Nature Reserve (S29°66′18.99″
E30°39′10.95″), while pig (Sus scrofa domesticus) faeces
were collected from a commercial pig farm in KwaZulu-
Natal and a private household (pig kept as a pet) situated in
Pietermaritzburg (KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa). All samples
were collected between February and May 2015 using sterile,
labelled plastic bags and immediately transferred on ice to the
laboratory with sample analysis taking place within 12 h.

Quantification of total and faecal coliforms and E. coli
from faecal samples

Enumeration of total and faecal coliforms as well as E. coli
was carried out in a single analysis for each of the five faecal
samples according to the most probable number (MPN) guide-
line procedure MFHPB-19 (Health Canada 2002).
Confirmation of presumptive E. coli isolates was done via
biochemical confirmation (GIMViC) and by PCR as de-
scribed previously (Gemmell and Schmidt, 2012). For the
PCR-based detection of the glutamate decarboxylase A
(gadA) gene, cells were harvested by centrifugation
(13,500×g, 5 min) from 1 ml of overnight cultures of pre-
sumptive E. coli isolates (nutrient broth, 35 °C, 120 rpm),
re-suspended in 100 μl sterile water followed by DNA extrac-
tion using a simple freeze and thaw technique (Gemmell and
Schmidt 2012). The amplification reactions, using primers
reported by Kim et al. (2006), were done in 25 μl volumes,
containing 1.5 μl template DNA, 0.5 μl of each primer
(10 μM, Inqaba), 12.5 μl 2× DreamTaq Green PCR Master
Mix (Thermo Scientific) and nuclease-free water (KAPA),
with the following cycling conditions (Labnet MultiGene II
thermocycler): initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min followed

by 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s,
72 °C for 1 min and a final extension cycle at 72 °C for 7 min.
PCR products were analysed by electrophoresis on 1% (w/v)
agarose gel with addition of SYBR Safe stain (Life technolo-
gies) and visualized under UV light using a Gbox Chemi
XRQ system (Syngene) and GeneSnap software. A ready-to-
use 100 bp DNA ladder (KAPA) was used as size marker, and
E. coli ATCC 8739 served as positive PCR control with
Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 14028 and sterile Milli-Q
water employed as negative controls.

Antibiotic susceptibility disk diffusion assay

The disk diffusion method (version 5, 2015) from the
European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Testing (EUCAST 2015) was used to assess the antibi-
otic resistance patterns of E. coli isolates. The following
12 antibiotics were tested employing ready-to-use 6-mm
disks (Oxoid): ampicillin (AMP 10 μg), amoxicillin-
clavulanic acid (AMC 20/10 μg), cefotaxime (CTX
5 μg), ceftazidime (CAZ 10 μg), ertapenem (ERT
10 μg), meropenem (MEM 10 μg), aztreonam (ATM
30 μg), ciprofloxacin (CIP 5 μg), norfloxacin (NOR
10 μg), gentamicin (GEN 10 μg),
tobramycin (TOB
10 μg) and tigecycline (TIG 15 μg). Antibiotics utilized
in this study were categorized into classes based on
therapeutic relevance, as suggested by Magiorakos
et al. (2012). For the disk diffusion assay, suspensions
from each E. coli
isolate were prepared from nutrient
broth cultures after incubation at 35 °C (120 rpm,
14 h) and adjusted to approximately 2 × 108 cells per
ml (corresponding to approximately 0.5 McFarland stan-
dard suggested by EUCAST) using a Helber-type bac-
terial counting chamber (Marienfeld, Germany). One
hundred microlitres of cell suspension was spread plated
onto Mueller-Hinton agar (Oxoid) plates containing
25 ml of agar per sterile 90 mm Petri dish. Four differ-
ent antibiotic test disks (adjusted for approximately 1 h
to ambient temperature) were firmly placed equidistantly
onto the agar surface. Plates were sealed using Parafilm
and incubated inverted in stacks of two at 35 °C for
20 h as specified (EUCAST 2015). Inhibition zones
were measured to the nearest millimetre using digital
Vernier callipers (Marshall Tools, India) and analysed
using the EUCAST antibiotic breakpoint
tables
(EUCAST 2016). All isolates were analysed in duplicate
against all 12 antibiotics.

Chemicals

Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals used were of the highest
purity commercially available.

Results

In this study, both total and faecal coliforms as well as E. coli
were quantified in faeces collected from zebra, wildebeest,
giraffe and farm and pet pig. The MPN values of total coli-
forms for wild herbivores were in the range from 4.51 to 5.36
log10 MPN/g, while values for pig faeces were slightly higher
at 5.50 and 5.70 log10 MPN/g (Table 1). Faecal coliform levels
were lower than the corresponding total coliform values, rang-
ing from 4.11 (wildebeest) to 5.50 log10 MPN/g (pet pig)
(Table 1). The log10 MPN/g values for E. coli in zebra, wilde-
beest and giraffe faeces were 4.69, 3.43 and 4.89 log10 MPN/
g, respectively, while the values for pet and farm pig faeces
were slightly higher at 5.11 and 5.14 log10 MPN/g (Table 1).
From each of the five tested animals, 30 randomly selected
confirmed faecal E. coli isolates were further analysed for
their antibiotic resistance patterns. In total, 106 out of 150
selected E. coli isolates from all animal faeces were resistant
to at least one of the 12 antibiotics tested (Tables S1 and 2).
The highest proportion of E. coli isolates showing resistance
to at least one antibiotic was found in zebra faeces (93%)
followed by isolates from pet pig and wildebeest faecal sam-
ples, with 90 and 80% resistance. In contrast, isolates from
farm pig and giraffe showed the lowest proportion of resis-
tances with 47 and 43%, respectively (Table 2). More than
half (56.6%) of all 106 E. coli isolates from wild herbivore
and pig faeces presenting antibiotic resistance possessed only
one resistance, followed by about 23% (24/106 isolates) with
a combination of two antibiotic resistances. The remaining 22
E. coli isolates showed resistances ranging from three (19
isolates) up to even five (one isolate) antibiotic compounds.
With few exceptions (four isolates), all antibiotic-resistant
(ABR) E. coli isolates possessed resistance against at least
one of the following tested β-lactam antibiotics: ampicillin,
amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime or aztre-
onam (Table S1). Of all antibiotics tested, amoxicillin-
clavulanic acid was the least effective as a large proportion
(94 isolates) of the ABR E. coli isolates obtained from all five
animals showed resistance against this compound (Fig. 1).
However, no resistances were observed for the two tested
carbapenems ertapenem and meropenem, the cephalosporin
cefotaxime and the glycylcycline tigecycline (Table S1).
Interestingly, only six out of all 106 ABR E. coli isolates were
resistant to ampicillin, 50% of which originated from farm pig
faeces (Table S1). The proportion of ceftazidime-resistant
E. coli isolates from zebra faeces was clearly higher than that
observed in all other animals (Fig. 1). Among the non-β-
lactam antibiotics tested, the least effective was the aminogly-
coside compound tobramycin and, to a lesser degree, genta-
micin (Fig. 1). Noticeably, one out of all 150 E. coli isolates
analysed—from farm pig faeces—presented resistance to both
ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, the two fluoroquinolones
tested.

The prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli iso-
lates—those showing resistance to antibiotics from at least
three different classes—was considerably lower with 19
MDR isolates detected among the 150 E. coli isolates
analysed (Table 2). Approximately 73% (14/19) of all these
MDR isolates originated from zebra faeces (hence 47% of the
30 zebra E. coli isolates), while the analysis of giraffe and
wildebeest faeces resulted in no E. coli isolates with multiple
drug resistance. The analysis of pet pig faeces established 10%
(3 out of 30) MDR isolates. Interestingly, the proportion of
MDR E. coli isolates obtained from farmed pig was also in the
lower range at about 7% (2 out of 30). The phenotypic resis-
tance profiles for all MDR E. coli isolates are summarized in
Table 3. Nearly all MDR E. coli isolates (18 out of 19) fea-
tured resistance against the antibiotic amoxicillin-clavulanic
acid, and 11 isolates (8 isolates from zebra and 3 from pet
pig) showed the same resistance profile of amoxicillin-
clavulanic acid, ceftazidime and tobramycin (AMC-CAZ-
TOB). One MDR E. coli isolate from farm pig faeces was
resistant to five different antibiotics: amoxicillin-clavulanic
acid, ampicillin, aztreonam, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin
(AMC-AMP-ATM-NOR-CIP). Moreover, this was the only
E. coli isolate displaying resistance to both fluoroquinolones
tested.

However, high levels of intermediate resistance were ob-
served for the aminoglycoside antibiotics gentamicin (136
isolates) and tobramycin (116 isolates), as well as for the β-
lactam antibiotics ceftazidime (101 isolates) and aztreonam

(98 isolates) (Table S1). In contrast to this, only one E. coli
isolate—from wildebeest faeces—presented an intermediate
resistance phenotype for tigecycline. In addition, less than
10 isolates showed an intermediate phenotype for the carba-
penem antibiotic meropenem and the fluoroquinolones
norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. As the EUCAST breakpoint
tables (2016) do not provide an intermediate resistance cate-
gory for ampicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, interme-
diate resistance phenotypes were not established for these two
antibiotics.

Discussion

As expected on microbiological grounds, the MPN values
established for faeces from all five animals were higher for
total and faecal coliforms than for E. coli. The level of E. coli
in pet and farm pig faeces in the current study was similar to
counts reported for E. coli in fresh pig slurry from a Bulgarian
pig farm (Petkov et al. 2006) and somewhat higher than the
numbers of E. coli established for faeces of zebra, giraffe and
wildebeest (Table 1). A similar scenario was observed in
France by Smati et al. (2015) when comparing E. coli counts
in faeces of wild and domesticated animals, which was
attributed to the variation in diet. Katakweba et al. (2015)
quantified in Tanzania E. coli in zebra faeces as 4.25 log10
CFU/g and in wildebeest faeces as 4.60 log10 CFU/g, which

observed against selected
antibiotics for Escherichia coli

is similar to the values obtained for the same animals in the
current study.

The overall degree of resistance to one or more of the 12
tested antibiotics observed in the current study was 71%. It
ranged from 43% for faecal E. coli isolates from giraffe to
93% for isolates from zebra. Among these faecal E. coli iso-
lates from the five animals, only a small proportion exhibited
ampicillin resistance (6/150). Similarly, less than 10%
ampicillin-resistant E. coli were reported for cattle in Serbia
(Knezevic and Petrovic 2008), while much higher percentage
values were reported for ampicillin-resistant faecal E. coli iso-
lates from wildebeest (58.8%) and zebra (47.6%) in Tanzania
(Katakweba et al. 2015).

In contrast to ampicillin resistance, the degree of
amoxicillin-clavulanic acid resistance among E. coli isolates
from zebra and wildebeest in the current study was at >70%
much higher than for E. coli isolates from wildebeest (14.7%)
and zebra (11.9%) in Tanzania (Katakweba et al. 2015).
Similarly, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid resistance for E. coli
isolates from pet and farm pig in the current study amounted
to 80 and 43%, respectively, while for pets and farm pigs from
Spain, only 6% of isolates were resistant to the same antibiotic
(Sáenz et al. 2001). Resistance levels for a given antibiotic
exceeding 70% are considered as extremely high for those
antibiotics considered important in human and veterinary
medicine (EFSA, 2017).

Antibiotic-resistant (ABR) E. coli isolates were identified
for the cephalosporin ceftazidime, ranging from about 7%
(wildebeest) to 53% (zebra) of isolates. Similar to pets and
farm pigs analysed in Spain (Sáenz et al. 2001), no resistance
was detected in the current study for the cephalosporin cefo-
taxime, although such resistance was reported for E. coli iso-
lates from herbivores in Tanzania (Katakweba et al. 2015).
About 21% of all E. coli isolates analysed in the current study
displayed intermediate resistance to cefotaxime and about
67% of the isolates for ceftazidime. This is concerning as third
generation cephalosporins are considered as critically impor-
tant antibiotics by the WHO (2016), and the EUCAST expert
rules suggest categorizing certain intermediate resistances as
resistant to avoid potential treatment failure (Leclercq et al.,
2013).

For the monobactam aztreonam, resistance levels observed
for E. coli isolates from faeces ranged from 0% for giraffe to
about 17% for zebra. Again, intermediate phenotypes were
detected for about 65% of E. coli isolates for aztreonam.

Carbapenems are intended for use in human medicine,
while their application in veterinary medicine should be
avoided (Poirel et al. 2014; WHO 2016). The absence of re-
sistance against the carbapenems meropenem and ertapenem
among all 150 tested E. coli isolates is therefore reassuring.
However, several E. coli isolates with intermediate resistance
against these two carbapenems were detected in our study.
Costa et al. (2008) detected no resistance to another carbapen-
em, imipenem, when analysing 112 E. coli isolates from a
large range of wild animals from nature reserves in Portugal,
thereby matching our data for the three herbivores analysed in
KwaZulu-Natal.

Only small numbers of ABR phenotypes were detected for
the fluoroquinolones norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. The only
incidence of resistance to both ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin
was detected for one E. coli isolate from farm pig faeces, with
two additional isolates from the same animal showing inter-
mediate resistance for ciprofloxacin and ciprofloxacin plus
norfloxacin, respectively. This is in line with Sáenz et al.
(2001), who identified 3% of E. coli isolates from farm pigs
as ciprofloxacin resistant, which may be due to the use of
fluoroquinolones for treating food animals (Collignon 2005).
Surprisingly, E. coli isolates showing an intermediate pheno-
type for fluoroquinolones were mostly present in zebra faeces
(Table S1).

Regarding aminoglycosides, the E. coli isolates from the
five animals tested showed resistance levels ranging from 3%
(farm pig, wildebeest) to 60% (zebra) for tobramycin, while
not exceeding 3% for gentamicin (Fig. 1). In contrast, genta-
micin resistance levels for E. coli from zebra and wildebeest in
Tanzania were higher at 23.8 and 20.6%, while this amounted
to only 3.2% in buffalo (Katakweba et al. 2015). Similar to our
results for farm pig, Knezevic and Petrovic (2008) found that
only 1% of E. coli isolated from swine presented resistance to
gentamicin and tobramycin. Remarkably high levels (>75%)
of intermediate phenotypes were detected for both aminogly-
cosides. As both gentamicin and tobramycin are approved for
use in veterinary medicine in South Africa (Eagar et al., 2012),
the somewhat higher incidence of tobramycin resistance in pet
pig isolates in our study might be due to veterinary treatment.
While no tigecycline resistance was detected among the
150 E. coli isolates analysed in this study, one isolate from
wildebeest faeces presented an intermediate resistance pheno-
type. Tetracycline resistance was reported in Africa for E. coli
isolates from impala (Mariano et al. 2009), wildebeest, zebra
and buffalo (Katakweba et al. 2015). However, tigecycline is a
newer-generation tetracycline-type antibiotic not usually con-
sidered for use in veterinary medicine (Papich 2012) and typ-
ically able to overcome tetracycline resistance mechanisms
(Fluit et al. 2005). Although mutations in tetracycline resis-
tance genes can confer increased minimum inhibitory concen-
tration values for tigecycline in E. coli (Linkevicius et al.
2016), no tigecycline resistance was detected among more

than 360 clinical isolates of E. coli from South Africa,
highlighting its efficiency (Kanj et al. 2014).

About 43% of antibiotic-resistant (ABR) faecal E. coli iso-
lates possessed resistance against more than one antibiotic,
and 19 isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR). The highest
proportion of multidrug resistance was observed for zebra
faecal E. coli isolates at 47%, while no MDR E. coli isolates
were detected in faeces from wildebeest and giraffe. Other
studies in Africa also showed a large variability in the
degree of multidrug resistance among E. coli isolates from
different wild animals. Pesapane et al. (2013) identified 40%
of faecal E. coli isolates from banded mongoose in the Chobe
National Park (Botswana) as MDR, attributing this to contact
between mongoose and guest and staff accommodations.
Similar to our results, Jobbins and Alexander (2015) detected
no MDR E. coli in giraffe faeces in Botswana. However, the
same study detected 100% MDR E. coli when analysing spot-
ted hyena faeces, suggesting that the variability of MDR prev-
alence between different animals was due to dietary factors,
water-proximity and association with urban areas. Similarly,
the presence of E. coli with extended spectrum β-lactamases
(ESBL) in wild boars in Europe was attributed to their omniv-
orous diet and access to animal and human waste (Literak
et al. 2010). Kozak et al. (2009) showed in Canada for ABR
E. coli and Nhung et al. (2015) demonstrated in Vietnam for
MDR E. coli phenotypes that these were manifold higher in
wild mammals trapped on farms than among mammals
trapped in natural areas such as forests, highlighting that anti-
biotic usage on farms and contact to humans contributes to
antibiotic resistance.

In the present study, the incidence of faecal E. coli isolates
resistant to at least one antibiotic was much lower in farm pig
(47%) and giraffe (43%) than in pet pig (90%), wildebeest
(80%) and zebra (93%). A possible reason for the higher per-
centage of ABR E. coli in pet pig faeces might be due to close
contact with humans and regular veterinary care as it is well
established that the treatment of pet animals can elevate anti-
biotic resistance levels in bacteria (Guardabassi et al. 2004).
Generally, elevated levels of ABR E. coli in faeces of the
three herbivores analysed in the present study might be due to
residents of Pietermaritzburg visiting the Bisley Valley Nature
Reserve for recreational purposes. The presence of ABR
E. coli in zebra faeces was linked in an earlier study to fre-
quent contact between animals and staff and visitor lodging
areas in Tanzania (Katakweba et al. 2015), while the transfer
of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to animals has been associated
with staff and their clothing (Bosman et al. 2014; Poirel et al.
2014).

Zebra and wildebeest preferentially graze close to the
soil—with possible additional exposure to human waste pres-
ent—while giraffe preferentially browse leaves from trees.
This in addition to geophagy, which is established for herbi-
vores and might lead to the uptake of antibiotics produced by

microorganisms present in the soil consumed (Mahaney et al.
1999), might explain to some degree why the level of faecal
ABR E. coli was clearly higher in the grazers zebra and wil-
debeest than in the browser giraffe.

Additional factors potentially contributing to the presence
of ABR E. coli in faeces from wild herbivores in the current
study are (i) horses from a stable adjacent to the Bisley Valley
Nature Reserve likely receiving veterinary attention that can
enter the park, (ii) other animal vectors such as small mam-
mals or migratory birds entering the park, (iii) herbicides such
as glyphosate used in the proximity of the nature reserve or
within it as these can cause elevated antibiotic resistance levels
in E. coli after exposure (Kurenbach et al. 2015) and (iv) water
bodies within the nature reserve with ABR E. coli, resistance
genes or even antibiotic residues present.

The data obtained in this study show that wild herbivores
from KwaZulu-Natal might serve as reservoirs and vectors for
ABR and even MDR E. coli strains. However, further research
is required in order to identify the factors involved in estab-
lishing the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the her-
bivores targeted in this study.
