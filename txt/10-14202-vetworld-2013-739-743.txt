Abstract

Aim: The present study was aimed to isolate and evaluate the continuous change in the pattern of drug resistance showed by 
different mastitogenic organisms, isolated from clinical and subclinical cases of mastitis.
Materials and Methods: The study was carried out using 150 milk samples received from various clinical and subclinical 
cases, from which the causative organisms were isolated and subjected to in vitro antibiotic sensitivity test.
Results: The bacteriological analysis of the samples indicated the presence of both Gram positive and Gram negative 
organisms followed by isolation of isolates like Staphylococcus, E. coli, Streptococcus, Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Listeria, 
Klebsiella. The in vitro sensitivity of Staphylococcus, E. coli and Streptococcus isolates revealed that they were more sensitive 
towards newer antimicrobials like Levofloxacin and Enrofloxacin.
Conclusion: The prevalence of Staphylococcus was found to be maximum followed by Streptococcus and E. coli among the 
isolated organisms. Levofloxacin and Enrofloxacin were found to be most effective against the targeted isolates.

        Since  the  isolation  of  organism  and  choice  of 
antimicrobial agent is often considered empirical in the 
management  of  mastitis,  the  present  study  was 
conducted  to  observe  the  sensitivity  and  resistance 
profile  of  mastitis  causing  isolates  (particularly 
Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Escherichia coli) 
within  and  around  Bhubaneswar,  against  various 
commonly used antimicrobials.
