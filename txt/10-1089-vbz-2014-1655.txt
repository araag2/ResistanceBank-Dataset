Abstract

A total of 261 healthy farm and pet animals (75 cattle, 52 goats, 100 dogs, and 34 cats) from different regions of
Tunisia were screened for Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage. Molecular typing of isolates (by spa- and
multilocus sequence-typing) was performed, and their antimicrobial resistance and virulence genotypes were
determined by PCR and sequencing. S. aureus isolates were detected in 17 of 261 tested samples (6.5%). All
S. aureus isolates recovered were methicillin-susceptible (MSSA), and one isolate/sample was further studied.
Eight different spa types were detected (t189, t279, t582, t701, t1166, t1268, t1534, and t1773), and eight
different sequence types were identiﬁed (ST6, ST15, ST45, ST133, ST188, ST700 [clonal complex CC130],
ST2057, and a new ST2121). MSSA from pets (six isolates) showed resistance to (number of isolates, resistance
gene): penicillin (six, blaZ), tetracycline (one, tet[M]), erythromycin one, erm[A]), streptomycin (one, ant[6]-
Ia), and ciproﬂoxacin (one). All isolates from farm animals showed susceptibility to the tested antimicrobials,
except for two penicillin-resistant isolates. Five S. aureus isolates from goats and cats harbored the lukF/lukS-
PV genes, encoding the Panton–Valentine leukocidin, and six isolates from goats harbored the tst virulence
gene. In addition, diverse combinations of enterotoxin genes were detected, including two variants of the egc
cluster. Goats and cats could represent a reservoir of important toxin genes, with potential implications in
animal and human health.

Introduction

S taphylococcus aureus is a common nasal and skin

colonizer of healthy humans and of different animal
species. However, it is also one of the most important op-
portunistic pathogens responsible for a variety of infections
in both humans and animals. It is frequently associated with
mastitis in cattle, sheep, and goats, causing chronic infections
in cows and clinical and subclinical infections in goats and
sheep. Most infections in pets usually involve skin and other
soft tissues, with postoperative infections of surgical wounds
being very common (Peton et al. 2013).

S. aureus is able to produce numerous adhesins and viru-
lence factors that facilitate cell invasion and bacterial growth,
and they are associated with the severity of S. aureus infec-
tions. One of these virulence factors is the Panton–Valentine
leukocidin (PVL), a cytotoxin that causes leukocyte de-
struction and tissue necrosis related to staphylococcal skin
and pulmonary infections. Other important virulence factors
are the toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST-1) and staphylo-
coccal enterotoxins (SEs) responsible for food poisoning
(Argudin et al. 2010, Zecconi and Scali 2013). It is also im-
portant to consider the capacity of S. aureus to acquire an-
tibiotic resistance; therefore, methicillin-resistant S. aureus

(MRSA) represents a major therapeutic problem with an
increasing frequency in severe infections.

The epidemiology and ecology of this bacterial species in
animals has gained interest in the last years, not only for its
importance in veterinary medicine but also for increasing
evidence of its zoonotic potential. The presence of S. aureus
in animals plays an important role in its epidemiology, and
contact with positive animals, especially MRSA carriers,
may pose a risk to human health (Weese 2010, Graveland
et al. 2011, Fitzgerald 2012). Animal-associated clonal lin-
eages of S. aureus are emerging, as it is the case of MRSA
ST398 among farm animals, mainly pigs, or CC97 among
bovines (Fitzgerald 2012). People exposed to livestock have
a greater risk of colonization and subsequently of infection.
Molecular typing techniques have demonstrated that isolates
from pets usually show similar characteristics to those of the
human isolates of the same geographic region (Haenni et al.
2012). Cases of S. aureus transmission between humans and
animals have increasingly been reported (Van Duijkeren
et al. 2005, Vitale et al. 2006, Fitzgerald 2012, Walther et al.
2012, Go´mez-Sanz et al. 2013).

During last decade, most studies on S. aureus in humans
and animals have focused on the molecular epidemiology of
MRSA. Recently, there have been an increasing number of
studies focused on clonal lineages of methicillin-susceptible
S. aureus (MSSA) in different countries. It is thought that
MRSA emerged by the acquisition of mecA or mecC genes in
MSSA and, for that, it is highly interesting to study the clones
and the characteristics of MSSA strains in diverse ecosys-
tems. Thus, we will be able to know more about the evolution
of this microorganism.

The objective of this study was to determine the nasal
carriage of S. aureus in healthy farm and pet animals in Tu-
nisia, to carry out the molecular typing of recovered isolates,
and to determine their content in antimicrobial resistance and
virulence genes.

Materials and Methods

Sampling and microbiological isolation

Nasal swabs of 127 healthy farm animals (75 cattle and 52
goats) were obtained during 2010–2011 from two farms of
the north and central region of Tunisia and one abattoir of
Tunis (Tunisia) that received cattle and goats from the entire
country. In addition, nasal samples of 134 healthy pets (100
dogs and 34 cats) were obtained in the National School of
Veterinary Medicine of Sidi Thabet and in two veterinary
clinics of Tunis. These animals came from Tunis and several
regions around Tunis and were brought in by their owners for
vaccination. The ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of
In Vivo Experiments) guidelines were followed in this study.

The origin of the 261 samples is shown in Table 1. All nasal
swabs were incubated in tryptone soy broth (TSB) and later
subcultured on Baird–Parker (BP) agar and on oxacillin-
resistance screening agar base (ORSAB) supplemented
with oxacillin (2 mg/L) for S. aureus and MRSA recovery,
respectively. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24–48 h.
One S. aureus–suspected colony per positive plate was
selected and identiﬁed by conventional methods (Gram-
staining, catalase test, oxidase test, DNase production, and
ability to coagulate rabbit plasma [BioRad]). S. aureus
identiﬁcation and methicillin resistance/susceptibility were
then conﬁrmed by ampliﬁcation of the species-speciﬁc nuc
gene and the mecA gene by multiplex PCR (Gharsa et al.
2012a). No clinical studies or patient data were included in
this study.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Susceptibility to 18 antimicrobial agents was performed
using the disk-diffusion method in accordance with the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recom-
mendations (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
2012). Antimicrobial agents tested were (charge in lg/disk,
except unit/disk for penicillin): Penicillin (10), oxacillin (1),
cefoxitin (30), kanamycin (30), gentamicin (10), tobramycin
(10), tetracycline (30), chloramphenicol (30), trimethoprim–
sulfamethoxazole (1.25/23.75), erythromycin (15), clin-
damycin (2), amikacin (30), ciproﬂoxacin (5), mupirocin (5),
vancomycin (30), teicoplanin (30), fusidic acid (10), and
streptomycin (10).

Detection of antimicrobial resistance genes

The presence of several genes that confer resistance to
penicillin (blaZ), tetracycline (tet[K], tet[L], tet[M], and
tet[O]), macrolides/lincosamides (erm[A], erm[B], erm[C]),
and streptomycin (ant[6]-Ia) was analyzed by PCR (Gharsa
et al. 2012a). In addition, isolates that belonged to the lineage
CC130 were tested for the presence of the novel mecC gene
(formerly named mecALGA251) (Cuny et al. 2011, Garcı´a-
Alvarez et al. 2011).

Pulsed-ﬁeld-gel-electrophoresis

All S. aureus isolates were characterized by pulsed-ﬁeld-
gel-electrophoresis (PFGE) with SmaI restriction enzyme
digestion as previously described (Bouzaiane et al. 2008).
Samples were run on a 1% agarose gel in 0.5 · Tris-borate-
EDTA (TBE) buffer at 14°C on a CHEF DR-II PFGE system
using switching times ranging from 5 to 40 s during 20 h at
6 V/cm. The DNA ﬁngerprints generated by PFGE were
analyzed visually and digitally according to Tenover criteria

(Tenover et al. 1995) and by Gel-Pro v. 3.1 software, re-
spectively. The obtained results were submitted to MVSP
software generating a dendrogram according to simple
matching coefﬁcient and the unweighted pair group method
with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) algorithm.

Other molecular typing methods of S. aureus isolates

S. aureus protein A (spa) typing was performed in all
S. aureus isolates as described elsewhere (Harmsen et al.
2003). The polymorphic X region of the spa gene was am-
pliﬁed by PCR, and sequences were analyzed using Ridom
Staph-Type software v.1.5.21 (Ridom GmbH), which auto-
matically detects spa repeats and assigns a spa type according
to http://spaserver.ridom.de/. The identiﬁcation of the allele
group of the accessory gene regulator locus (agr) was de-
termined by two duplex PCRs, as previously described
(Shopsin et al. 2003).

Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed in all
S. aureus isolates detected. The allelic proﬁle of each isolate
was obtained by sequencing internal fragments of seven
unlinked housekeeping genes (arcC, aroE, glpF, gmk, pta,
tpi, and yqiL) to determine the sequence type (ST) and clonal
complex (CC) assigned by MLST and BURST (Based Upon
Related Sequence Types) analyses (www.mlst.net).

Detection of staphylococcal toxin genes

All isolates were tested by PCR for the presence of 18
genes coding for staphylococcal enterotoxins (sea, seb, sec,
sed, see, seg, seh, sei, sej, sek, sel, sem, sen, seo, sep, seq, ser,
and seu). The presence of the enterotoxin gene cluster egc
was considered when ﬁve SE genes (seg, sei, sem, sen, and
seo) were detected; the egc-like cluster included six SE genes
(seg, sei, sem, sen, seo, and seu) ( Jarraud et al. 2001, Hwang
et al. 2007).

Isolates were also screened for the presence of tst gene
encoding the TSST-1 (Jarraud et al. 2002), lukF/lukS-PV
genes encoding PVL, lukE-lukD genes encoding the bicom-
ponent leukotoxin LukE-LukD, lukM gene encoding leuko-
cidin M, as well as eta and etb genes encoding exfoliative
toxins A and B, respectively, and genes encoding hemolysins
A, B, D, G, and Gv ( Jarraud et al. 2001, Lozano et al. 2011).

Results

Field survey results for S. aureus isolates
from healthy animals

To isolate S. aureus from nasal samples, each enrichment
culture of nasal swabs was subcultured on BP medium. At
48 h postinoculation, S. aureus-like colonies were identiﬁed
in 17 of the 261 nasal samples (6.5%), including 10 goats
(19.2%), four dogs (4%), two cats (5.9%), and one cow
(1.3%). From each putative S. aureus–positive sample, one
S. aureus–like colony was selected and further tested for
identiﬁcation of the species using both conventional methods
and a species-speciﬁc PCR method, as described in Materials
and Methods. All 17 isolates were conﬁrmed as S. aureus and
all of them were MSSA.

The enrichment cultures of nasal swabs were also tested
for MRSA recovery by inoculating to ORSAB plates. No
staphylococcal colonies were detected on ORSAB plates for
all samples tested.

Characteristics of S. aureus isolates detected
in healthy farm animals

S. aureus isolates were recovered from 11 of the 127 tested
samples (8.7%) of farm animals. These isolates were recov-
ered from 10 goat samples and one cow sample. The char-
acteristics of the 11 MSSA recovered isolates are shown in
Table 2. Four different spa types were detected among these
S. aureus isolates (t1534, t1268, t1773, and t1166), and four
different STs were identiﬁed by MLST (ST2057, ST45,
ST700, and ST133). The STs detected among these MSSA
isolates of farm animals were classiﬁed into four clonal
complexes: CC522 (four isolates), CC45 (three isolates),
CC130 (three isolates), and CC133 (one isolate). Typing of
the agr locus showed that S. aureus isolates were ascribed to
agr type I (eight isolates), to agr type II (two isolates), and to
a nontypeable agr (one isolate).

Analysis of SmaI macrorestriction proﬁles of the 11 MSSA
isolates revealed ﬁve different PFGE patterns (P1–P5) (Fig. 1
and Table 2).

Two isolates from goat samples showed resistance to
penicillin (with the bla[Z] gene), and the remaining isolates
from farm animal samples were susceptible to all tested an-
timicrobial agents. The three MSSA isolates that belonged to
the clonal complex CC130 were tested by PCR for the mecC
gene, obtaining a negative result.

Three S. aureus isolates from goats harbored the lukF/lukS-
PV genes and six isolates presented the tst gene. Other virulence
genes carried by MSSA isolates were (number of isolates): hla
(eleven), hlb (eight), hld (eleven), hlg (three), hlgv (three),
lukED (eight), lukM (six), sec (six), sed (two), seg (one), sei
(one), sej (three), sel (nine), ser (four), and egc-like cluster: seg-
sei-sem-sen-seo-seu (three) (Table 2). The remaining PCR vir-
ulence genes tested were negative among these isolates.

Characteristics of S. aureus isolates detected
in healthy pets

S. aureus isolates were recovered from six of the 134 tested
samples of healthy pets (4.5%), obtained from four dogs and
two cats, all of them of the National School of Veterinary
Medicine. The characteristics of the six MSSA isolates from
pet animals are shown in Table 2. Four different spa types
were detected among these isolates (t189, t279, t582, and
t701), and four STs were also identiﬁed by MLST (ST6,
ST15, ST188, and a new ST registered as ST2121). ST2121
showed the allelic proﬁle numbered as follows: arcc(2)-
aroe(2)-glpf(2)-gmk(2)-pta(7)-tpi(3)-yqil(2). The sequence
types detected among these S. aureus isolates of pet animals
were classiﬁed into three clonal complexes: CC5 (three iso-
lates), CC15 (two isolates), and CC30 (which enclosed the
new ST2121). Typing of the agr locus showed that S. aureus
isolates were ascribed to agrI (four isolates), agrII (one iso-
late), and agrIII (one isolate).

Analysis of SmaI macrorestriction proﬁles of the six MSSA
isolates revealed four different PFGE patterns (P6–P9), and
three subtypes in pulsotype P7 (P7a–P7c) (Fig. 1 and Table 2).
The three isolates with closely related PFGE patterns corre-
sponded to those typed as ST6, spa type t701, and agrI, and
they were recovered from two unrelated dogs and one cat.

All MSSA isolates showed penicillin resistance (harboring
the blaZ gene); one isolate also exhibited tetracycline and
erythromycin resistance (with the tet[M] and erm[A] genes),

and one additional isolate presented streptomycin resistance
(containing the ant[6]-Ia gene) (Table 2).

The two S. aureus isolates from cats harbored the lukF/
lukS-PV genes encoding the PVL. Other virulence genes
carried by MSSA from pets were (number of isolates): hla
(six), hlb (four), hld (six), hlg (one), hlgv (one), lukED (ﬁve),
sea (three), see (two), sei (two), ser (four), and an egc cluster
variant that included the seg-sei-sem-sen-seu genes (one)
(Table 2). The remaining virulence genes tested were nega-
tive among these isolates from pets.

Discussion

A relatively low recovery rate of S. aureus isolates was
detected among nasal samples of healthy animals in this study
(6.5%), with different rates depending on the animal species.
However, MRSA was not detected in the analyzed samples. To
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study of this type performed in
Tunisia. Higher S. aureus nasal carriage rates in goats ( > 64%)
and cows (7.5%) were identiﬁed by others in Norway, Canada,
or Denmark (Barbour et al. 1997, Mork et al. 2010, Eriksson
et al. 2013). Regarding pets, a study performed in Canada
showed a rate of 14% in dogs and 4.3% in cats, MRSA being
detected in 1.5% of analyzed dogs (Hanselman et al. 2009).
Other studies carried out in healthy pets detected a rate of 8.8%
in China (four) and 12% in Spain (Go´mez-Sanz et al. 2013).
However, lower values have been also detected in other studies
(Wan et al. 2011). These different carriage rates might be due
to the different animal population studied or to the employed
methodologies, among other factors.

The high diversity of genetic lineages of S. aureus detected
among farm animals and pets is noteworthy. In these terms,
the results of molecular typing by MLST, PFGE, and spa
typing (Table 2 and Fig. 1) exhibited elevated variability.
Higher diversity in the different molecular typing approaches
has been previously shown in MSSA isolates in comparison
with MRSA (Grundmann et al. 2010).

Four STs distributed in four CCs were identiﬁed among
our S. aureus isolates from goat and bovine samples. Lineage
ST700 detected in three MSSA isolates (from two goats and
one cow) belonging to CC130, which was mainly related to
bovine animals. However, this ST has been also identiﬁed in
goats (Smyth et al. 2009, Porrero et al. 2012, Eriksson et al.
2013). It is important to remark that our CC130 isolates did
not harbor the recently described mecC gene. This gene was
ﬁrst described in MRSA (mecA negative) of this lineage in
cattle in 2011 (Garcı´a-Alvarez et al. 2011), and since then
several studies have reported its presence in MRSA of a wide
range of mammal species in Europe, the majority of them be-
longing to the same lineage (Cuny et al. 2011, Paterson et al.
2012). Alternatively, the clonal complex CC522, also detected
in isolates from goats in our study, had previously been iden-
tiﬁed in samples of this animal species in Spain (Porrero et al.
2012). CC133, detected in one MSSA from goats, is considered
as one of the major small-ruminant lineages (Guinane et al.
2010, Eriksson et al. 2013). The three PVL-positive MSSA from
goats belonged to the clonal complex CC45 and to the agr type
I, characteristics previously detected among human MRSA
strains (Seidl et al. 2011). A possible human origin of this clonal
complex has been previously suggested (Sobral et al. 2012).

The four STs identiﬁed among MSSA from pets were
distributed in three different CCs, as is the case of CC5,

CC15, and CC30. The presence of S. aureus that belongs to
CC5 among pets is becoming unexceptional (Haenni et al.
2012, Walther et al. 2012), and its presence in other animals
as poultry is commonly observed (Hasman et al. 2010). The
clonal complex CC15, identiﬁed in two MSSA isolates in our
study (one dog and one cat), has been recently described in
MSSA of pets in France and in a recent study on S. aureus
of donkeys in Tunisia (Gharsa et al. 2012a, Sobral et al. 2012).
In addition, a new ST belonging to CC30 was identiﬁed
(ST2121). This CC is one of the predominant hospital- and
community-associated MRSA clones, and MSSA isolates of
this lineage have also been described (Monecke et al. 2011), its
presence in swine isolates being also unexceptional (Hasman
et al. 2010). These data and our results illustrate the spread of
S. aureus human lineages among different animal species.

The detection of PVL-positive MSSA isolates in farm
animals (6% of tested goats) and pets (6% of tested cats) is of
relevance due to the important role that this toxin seems to
have in serious infections (Melles et al. 2006). A high
prevalence of the PVL genes in MRSA isolates recovered
from dogs has been detected in other studies (Rankin et al.
2005, Van Duijkeren et al. 2005). On the other hand, none of
the canine S. aureus isolates harbored the PVL genes in other
reports (Boost et al. 2008, Hanselman et al. 2009, Walther
et al. 2012, Go´mez-Sanz et al. 2013). Regarding its detection
in cats, there are several studies that have identiﬁed these
toxin genes in MRSA of these animals, but not in MSSA
isolates (Rankin et al. 2005, Vitale et al. 2006). The existence
of the PVL genes in three S. aureus isolates from goats in our
study population is also relevant. A recent study revealed the
presence of lukF/lukS-PV genes in ewe isolates (Van Duij-
keren et al. 2005), but not in goats.

Our results showed that S. aureus isolated from goats had a
high enterotoxigenic potential. Similar results were found in
S. aureus isolated from goat and bovine mastitis in Turkey
(Unal et al. 2012). S. aureus isolates from our goat and sheep
population contained sec and sel genes, whereas those from
cows carried mainly sea, sej, and sed genes. Moreover, six
S. aureus isolates of goats that harbored the sec gene were
simultaneously positive for the tst gene. These combinations
of toxin tst/sec genes have been described before in S. aureus
isolated from goats (Scherrer et al. 2004). The frequency of
other enterotoxins (sed, seg, sei, sej, sel, sem, sen, seo, ser,
seu) in our goat isolates is in agreement with previous studies
(Valle et al. 1990), which described healthy goats as an im-
portant reservoir of enterotoxigenic staphylococci. An egc-
like cluster was detected in three of our 10 isolates from
goats. Similarly, the detection of this egc cluster was reported
in goats, and it has been suggested that its presence may
confer a survival advantage of S. aureus in animals by
modulating the immune response (Smyth et al. 2005).

With regard to the enterotoxin genes detected in isolates
from pets, a previous study performed in Egypt revealed that
10% and 2.1% of dogs and cats, respectively, carried en-
terotoxigenic S. aureus isolates (Abdel-Moein et al. 2011).
Additionally, a recent report from Spain revealed that 75% of
pet animals (dogs, cats) investigated presented at least one
enterotoxin gene (Go´mez-Sanz et al. 2013). These data
highlight the potential role of enterotoxigenic S. aureus–
positive pets in the epidemiology of household food poi-
sonings. An egc cluster variant carrying seg-sei-sem-sen-seu
was detected in one S. aureus isolate of a dog. The egc cluster

114

and its variants are considered as a putative source of su-
perantigens in S. aureus ( Jarraud et al. 2001).

All of our MSSA isolates showed susceptibility to the
tested antimicrobials, with few exceptions. Penicillin resis-
tance was detected in a high proportion of tested isolates of
pets. However, this result contrasts with the low rate detected
in farm animals in the current study and in a recent report on
sheep isolates in Tunisia (Gharsa et al. 2012b). The low
penicillin resistance among these animals is in agreement
with other authors (Unal et al. 2012). However, elevated rates
of penicillin resistance are very common among the general
S. aureus population.

It should be taken in consideration that in this study the
data were obtained from two farms and one abattoir. How-
ever, more extensive studies with farms and abattoirs in the
entire country are necessary to determine the global situation
in this country.

Conclusions

The data reported here demonstrate that the nares of
healthy pets, goats, and cows could be reservoirs of PVL-
positive and TSST-1–positive S. aureus isolates and other
virulence genes, such as those encoding enterotoxins. It is
noteworthy that not only MRSA but also MSSA isolates from
these animals should be studied. More studies should be
performed in the future to expand the knowledge on the ge-
netic lineages of S. aureus circulating among healthy farm
animals and pets, as well as on the capacity of these isolates to
produce virulence factors, due to the risk of animal-to-human
bacterial transference and therefore its potential animal and
human health implications.
