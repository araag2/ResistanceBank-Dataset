ABSTRACT

The  aim  of  this  study  was  the  characterization  of 
a  collection  of  8  methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus 
aureus  (MRSA)  isolates,  obtained  from  samples  of 
fresh  cheese  (Doble  Crema)  elaborated  from  raw  cow 
milk  in  small  dairies  in  Colombia.  All  the  isolates 
harbored  the  mecA  and  Panton-Valentine  leukocidin 
(PVL) genes, presented with SCCmec type IV, and be-
longed to multilocus sequence type 8 and spa type 024. 
Seven  isolates  presented  3  closely  related  pulsed-field 
gel electrophoresis profiles. Three of them carried the 
staphylococcal  enterotoxin  B  gene.  The  isolates  were 
resistant  to  cefoxitin,  oxacillin,  penicillin,  and  ampi-
cillin  and  susceptible  to  all  non-β-lactams  antibiotics 
tested, with minimum inhibitory concentration values 
for oxacillin of 4 to 8 mg/L. The isolates belonged to the 
community-acquired MRSA group, suggesting a human 
source of contamination. The risk of human infection 
by  MRSA  via  contaminated  foods  is  considered  low, 
but contaminated food commodities can contribute to 
the  worldwide  dissemination  of  clones  of  community-
acquired MRSA.
Key  words:  methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus

Short Communication

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 
is a microorganism of concern as an important cause 
of  nosocomial  infections  (hospital-associated  MRSA). 
In  recent  years,  the  appearance  of  cases  outside  the 
hospital environment has put the focus in the so-called 
community-associated  or  community-acquired  MRSA 
strains (CA-MRSA). The CA-MRSA are considered 
a serious threat to public health because they can be 
easily  spread  through  healthy  carriers  and  they  pres-

ent additional virulence factors that make them more 
likely to cause disease (Weber, 2005). The CA-MRSA 
strains generally carry the Panton-Valentine leukocidin 
(PVL) gene, staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec 
(SCCmec) type IV, and are susceptible to antimicro-
bials  other  than  β-lactams  (Vandenesch  et  al.,  2003). 
The third significant type of MRSA is associated with 
livestock animals, which was initially detected in swine 
farms in Europe and nowadays is distributed worldwide 
and  has  spread  to  humans  and  other  animal  species. 
Most livestock-associated MRSA isolates are resistant 
to tetracyclines and do not carry either the PVL gene 
or staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) genes (EFSA, 2009; 
Doyle et al., 2011).

 

Even  though  the  isolation  of  MRSA  from  livestock 
and  foods  of  animal  origin  has  been  reported  exten-
sively, the effect of MRSA in food-related illness is very 
low. To date, only 2 outbreaks of MRSA involving food 
have been reported (Kluytmans et al., 1995; Jones et al., 
2002). However, there are some concerns whether food 
can constitute a reservoir of MRSA and food handlers 
can become infected with MRSA via food manipulation 
(EFSA, 2009; Doyle et al., 2011).

The prevalence of MRSA in cattle appears to be low 
(Alves et al., 2009), but there are reports of isolation 
of MRSA as an agent of intramammary infection (Lee, 
2006; Luini et al., 2015) and also from bulk tank milk 
and  dairy  products  (Normanno  et  al.,  2007;  Virgin 
et  al.,  2009;  Can  and  Çelik,  2012).  Strains  of  MRSA 
are disseminated worldwide and S. aureus remains as 
an  important  foodborne  pathogen  in  Latin  America 
(Pires et al., 2012); however, studies on the prevalence 
of  MRSA  in  food  commodities  in  Latin  America  are 
scarce (Rizek et al., 2011; Vanegas López et al., 2012). 
In a study carried out in Colombia by Vanegas-López et 
al. (2012), they identified 5 MRSA strains (one of them 
from milk cream) among 149 isolates.

Doble  Crema  (double  cream)  cheese  is  one  of  the 
most popular cheeses in Colombia, accounting for more 
than  30%  of  total  cheese  consumption.  It  is  a  fresh 
cheese similar to mozzarella and other stretched curd

cheeses and traditionally made from raw cow milk in 
small  dairies  in  Colombia.  In  research  carried  out  on 
Doble  Crema  cheese,  we  characterized  65  isolates  of 
coagulase-positive  staphylococci  and  18.5%  of  them 
were MRSA carrying the mecA gene (Herrera and San-
tos, 2015a,b). The aim of this study was to characterize 
the collection of 8 MRSA isolates by genetic typing and 
antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

The isolates were obtained from samples of raw milk 
cheese (Doble Crema cheese) collected at the retail level 
between  April  2012  and  April  2013  and  identified  as 
coagulase-positive  staphylococci  and  MRSA  as  previ-
ously described (Herrera and Santos, 2015a,b). Briefly, 
S. aureus counts were determined on Baird Parker Agar 
with  egg  yolk-tellurite  (Oxoid,  Basingstoke,  UK)  and 
up to 3 typical colonies were confirmed as coagulase-
positive by coagulase test (Lancette and Bennet, 2001). 
Isolates from 8 cheese samples carried the mecA gene 
and were considered as MRSA. Bacterial strains were 
preserved at −80°C in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI; Ox-
oid) broth plus 30% glycerol and routinely cultured in 
BHI broth at 37°C.

Antimicrobial  susceptibility  testing  of  the  isolates 
was performed using the disk diffusion method recom-
mended  by  EUCAST  (www.eucast.org)  against  the 
following  antimicrobials:  cefoxitin,  oxacillin,  penicil-
lin,  ampicillin,  gentamicin,  ciprofloxacin,  levofloxa-
cin,  norfloxacin,  ofloxacin,  teicoplanin,  vancomycin, 
clindamycin,  azithromycin,  clarithromycin,  erythro-
mycin,  chloramphenicol,  nitrofurantoin,  rifampicin, 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 
trimethoprim,  and 
tetracycline, using S. aureus CECT 794 as the control 
strain. Isolates were classified as susceptible or resistant 
according to the EUCAST breakpoint Table 2016 v6.0. 
Minimum inhibitory concentration values for oxacillin 
were determined with M.I.C. Evaluator strips (Oxoid) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Amplification  of  genes  responsible  for  production 
of selected enterotoxins (SEA, SEB, SEC, SED, SEE, 
SEG, SEH, and SEI), resistance to methicillin (mecA 
and mecC), production of PVL (lukS/F), and the pres-
ence of the arcA gene of the arginine catabolic mobile 
element (ACME) was carried out from a fresh culture 
of each isolate. An aliquot of 1 mL was centrifuged and 
the pellet was treated with 200 µL of InstaGene matrix 
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) to release the DNA. Primers 
and  conditions  of  the  PCR  protocols  were  described 
elsewhere (Lina et al., 1999; Smyth et al., 2001; Jarraud 
et  al.,  2002;  Diep  et  al.,  2008;  García-Álvarez  et  al., 
2011).

The SCCmec type was determined by the multiplex-
PCR  procedure  described  by  Boye  et  al.  (2007).  The 
spa type was established by amplifying and sequencing 

the spa gene (Shopsin et al., 1999) and sequences were 
analyzed  with  spaTyper  (http://spatyper.fortinbras.
us/).  Pulsed-field  gel  electrophoresis  (PFGE)  was 
carried  out  as  described  by  McDougal  et  al.  (2003). 
Comparison of profiles was done with the GelCompar 
6.5 software (Applied Maths, St. Martens Latem, Bel-
gium). Similarities were obtained using the Dice coef-
ficient at 0.5% optimization and 1.25% tolerance, and a 
dendrogram was constructed with the unweighted-pair 
group  method  using  the  arithmetic  mean  clustering 
method. Multilocus sequence typing was performed fol-
lowing the procedure of Enright et al. (2000), and the 
allele  number  and  sequence  type  of  the  isolates  were 
assigned by comparison with data available in the mul-
tilocus sequence typing database (http://saureus.beta.
mlst.net/).

The  8  isolates  were  resistant  to  cefoxitin  (30  µg), 
oxacillin  (1  µg),  and  the  β-lactam  antibiotics  and 
susceptible to all non-β-lactam antibiotics tested. The 
MIC  values  for  oxacillin  were  4  mg/L  for  6  isolates 
(FH 30, FH 32, FH 34, FH 44, FH 65, and FH 67) and 
8 mg/L for 2 isolates (FH 38 and FH 61), which are 
values  that  allow  classification  of  isolates  as  MRSA. 
All the isolates harbored the mecA and the PVL lukS/
lukF genes, which are characteristic features of the CA-
MRSA group (Vandenesch et al., 2003). The mecC gene 
was not detected in any MRSA  isolate; this homolog 
of mecA was reported recently (García-Álvarez et al., 
2011) and few studies are available on the prevalence 
of  mecC  in  humans  and  animals  (Diaz  et  al.,  2016). 
Strains carrying the mecC gene have been isolated from 
cattle in different European countries, but not on the 
American continent; however, it is advisable to check 
for its presence to monitor its dissemination over time 
and  to  discover  potential  animal  reservoirs  (García-
Álvarez et al., 2011; Petersen et al., 2013; Ariza-Miguel 
et al., 2014; Diaz et al., 2016).

Genetic  typing  revealed  that  the  isolates  presented 
with  the  same  SCCmec  type  IV  and  belonged  to  se-
quence type 8 and spa type t024, related to the USA300 
type, the predominant cause of CA-MRSA infection in 
the United States (Tenover and Goering, 2009), which 
is disseminated in Latin America, particularly in Co-
lombia (Reyes et al., 2009; Márquez-Ortiz et al., 2014). 
The isolates we studied failed to amplify the arcA gene, 
an ACME-specific gene often found in USA300 isolates 
(Planet  et  al.,  2013),  but  that  seems  to  be  absent  in 
the Latin American strains (Márquez-Ortiz et al., 2014; 
Hidalgo  et  al.,  2015).  Moreover,  USA300  isolates  are 
showing increasing tetracycline resistance (Tenover and 
Goering, 2009), which can be related to the presence of 
ACME (Planet et al., 2013), thus explaining the lack 
of tetracycline resistance found in our isolates and in

other studies carried out with USA300-related strains 
isolated in Colombia (Hidalgo et al., 2015).

Seven isolates (FH 65-FH 67, FH 30-FH 32-FH 34, 
and FH 38-FH 61) presented 3 closely related PFGE 
profiles  with  94.4%  similarity,  whereas  isolate  FH  44 
presented  a  different  band  pattern  (Figure  1).  Visual 
comparison  of  pulsotypes  showed  similarities  with 
those obtained by Márquez-Ortiz et al. (2014) among 
Colombian pediatric patients.

Three  isolates  (FH  61,  FH  65,  and  FH  67)  carried 
the SEB gene. The presence of genes responsible for SE 
production in food isolates of MRSA has been described 
by other authors (Normanno et al., 2007; Can and Çe-
lik, 2012) and there is a reported outbreak of foodborne 
intoxication due to an enterotoxigenic strain of MRSA 
producing  SEC  (Jones  et  al.,  2002).  Methicillin-resis-
tant S. aureus is a pathogen of concern due to the se-
verity of the illnesses caused and its worldwide spread. 
Its presence in foods of animal origin adds additional 
threats, as it may cause staphylococcal intoxication if 
the strains are able to produce enterotoxin, and may 
contribute  to  the  dissemination  along  the  food  chain 

(Doyle et al., 2011). On the other hand, the SEB is a 
toxin  type  rarely  associated  with  staphylococcal  food 
poisoning (Seo and Bohach, 2013). The characteristics 
of the isolates are summarized in Table 1.

The results of the present study show the presence of 
USA300-related strains of CA-MRSA in Doble Crema 
cheese,  indicating  a  human  source  of  contamination. 
Transmission of MRSA strains between farm workers 
and farm animals has been reported (Juhász-Kaszany-
itzky et al., 2007; Lim et al., 2013) and also between 
food handlers and foods (Jones et al., 2002). The risk 
of human infection by MRSA via contaminated foods 
is considered low (EFSA, 2009), but food-related out-
breaks of MRSA infection and intoxication have been 
reported  (Kluytmans  et  al.,  1995;  Jones  et  al.,  2002) 
and contaminated food commodities can contribute to 
the  worldwide  dissemination  of  clones  of  CA-MRSA 
(Ogata  et  al.,  2012;  Rodríguez-Lázaro  et  al.,  2015). 
Improved hygienic measures in food processing plants 
are needed to ensure the microbiological safety of foods. 
More studies must be conducted to identify the sources 
of contamination and to implement control mechanisms.
