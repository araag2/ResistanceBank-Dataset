Salmonella enterica is a well-known pathogen commonly acquired from the consumption of contami-
nated food. It has been estimated to affect millions of humans and cause hundreds of thousands of deaths
per year globally. Pork, one of the most commonly consumed meats worldwide, has been identiÔ¨Åed as
one of the main sources of human salmonellosis. In this study, we aimed to detect and characterize
S. enterica from slaughtered swine and generate antimicrobial resistance proÔ¨Åles of select isolates. Tonsils
and jejunum with mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were collected from a total of 240 swine from eight
abattoirs (Ô¨Åve accredited and three locally registered abattoirs) across Metro Manila. S. enterica were
isolated using conventional culture methods and conÔ¨Årmed by PCR ampliÔ¨Åcation of the invA gene.
Isolates were further characterized based on somatic antigen by multiplex PCR. We report that there is
no signiÔ¨Åcant difference (P ¬º 0.42) between the incidences of S. enterica in swine slaughtered in
accredited (44.0%) and in locally registered abattoirs (46.7%). Most samples were contaminated with
S. enterica under serogroup O:3,10. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 183 isolates using the VITEK¬Æ 2
system revealed high resistance to ampicillin (67.8%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (80.3%).
Multidrug-resistance was found in 124 (67.8%) isolates.

1. Introduction

Pork is one of the most commonly consumed meats worldwide
(OECD, 2015; FAO, 2014). In 2015, world consumption of pork was
118,230 metric tons. In the Philippines alone, 1006 metric tons of
pork was consumed in the same year. Next to chicken, pork has
been consistently the most consumed meat in the Philippines since
2000 (OECD, 2015). Consequently, the swine industry has been the
biggest contributor in Philippine livestock production since 1980,
and total hog production in the Philippines has been increasing
since (CountrySTAT Philippines, 2016). Pork, both raw and pro-
cessed, is considered as one of the main sources of salmonellosis in
humans (de Freitas Neto et al., 2010). Several outbreaks of Salmo-
nella from pork have been reported worldwide.

outbreak of S. Typhimurium was identiÔ¨Åed in Denmark, Norway,
and Sweden. It was later conÔ¨Årmed that pork from Denmark was
the source of S. Typhimurium (Bruun et al., 2009). This case dem-
onstrates the potential of Salmonella to cause international out-
breaks due to meat export and import. Outbreaks of S.
Typhimurium have also been reported in Sydney in 1995 (Delpech
et al., 1998) and in Denmark in 2010 (Kuhn et al., 2013). From 1998
to 2008, pork has been implicated to 37 Salmonella outbreaks in the
United States (US) (Jackson et al., 2013). More recently in 2015,
another Salmonella outbreak from pork occurred in Ô¨Åve states in the
US (CDC, 2015).

The risk of S. enterica contamination in pork increases along the
production chain and peaks during slaughter at the abattoir
(Arguello et al., 2012; Gomes-Neves et al., 2012). It is therefore
necessary that abattoirs maintain proper sanitation and high levels
of hygiene to prevent the spread of the pathogen. In the Philippines,
abattoirs are regulated either by the national or the local govern-
ment. Abattoirs that have adequate facilities and operational pro-
cedures are ‚Äúaccredited‚Äù by the national government, while those

52

that have failed to meet the standards are regulated by the local
government (locally registered).

In the Philippines, routine testing of Salmonella is often limited
to culture techniques (Ng and Rivera, 2015). Application of molec-
ular methods rarely occurs, and is limited only to genus or species
identiÔ¨Åcation. Serogrouping is almost never conducted. Molecular
characterization often starts with PCR-based detection methods
and then followed by subtyping (Adzitey et al., 2013). PCR-based
detection of Salmonella commonly targets the invA gene, and its
sensitivity and speciÔ¨Åcity have been validated by several studies
(Chiu and Ou, 1996; Malorny et al., 2003; Rahn et al., 1992). The invA
gene is unique to Salmonella and plays a critical role in the invasion
of epithelial cells (Galan and Curtiss, 1991; Rahn et al., 1992). It
encodes a highly conserved protein component of the Salmonella
type III secretion system which translocates bacterial proteins
across the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm of the host cell
(Lilic et al., 2010). The invA gene is found in almost all strains of
Salmonella which makes it a suitable detection marker. Molecular
subtyping of Salmonella begins with serogrouping. Multiplex PCR-
based serogrouping is most commonly employed, and is based on
the sequence of the somatic (O) antigen, the outermost component
of the lipopolysaccharide layer in Gram-negative bacteria. In Sal-
monella, a considerable amount of diversity is found in O antigens
which contribute to its antigenic diversity (Fitzgerald et al., 2003).
Monitoring the antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella is
important in determining the choice of treatment for salmonellosis
in pigs and to shed light on the resistant Salmonella that may be
transferred to humans (Van der Wolf et al., 1999). In the Philippines,
clinical non-typhoid Salmonella resistant to ciproÔ¨Çoxacin and cef-
triaxone has been generally increasing since 2005. In 2014, 21.6%
and 13.0% of non-typhoid Salmonella isolates were resistant to
ciproÔ¨Çoxacin and ceftriaxone, respectively (RITM, 2014).

The objective of the present study was to estimate the incidence
of S. enterica from freshly slaughtered swine in selected accredited
and locally regulated abattoirs in Metro Manila, Philippines. Spe-
ciÔ¨Åcally, this study aimed to (i) detect and isolate S. enterica from
the tonsils and jejunum with mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) of
slaughtered swine using both culture and PCR-based methods, (ii)
determine the serogroup of S. enterica isolates using a PCR-based
characterization of the somatic antigen, (iii) generate antimicro-
bial resistance proÔ¨Åles of selected S. enterica using VITEK¬Æ 2, and
(iv) compare the incidences of S. enterica contamination in swine
slaughtered in accredited and in locally registered abattoirs.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sample collection

A total of 240 swine from Ô¨Åve accredited and three locally
registered abattoirs in Metro Manila were analyzed in the study.
These establishments were located in the four districts of Metro
Manila: Capital District (1), Eastern Manila (1), Northern Manila (4),
and Southern Manila (2). Thirty hogs, all coming from the same
farm, were randomly selected for sample collection from each
abattoir. Upon evisceration, tonsil tissues and a 15-cm segment of
the jejunum including its contents and MLN were collected from
each hog using sterile scissors and forceps. The samples were
transferred into sterile plastic bags and chilled in a cooler during
transport to the laboratory. All samples were processed immedi-
ately upon arrival at the laboratory.

2.2. Bacterial enrichment and isolation

and transferred to 225 mL buffered peptone water (BPW), agitated
for 2 min, and incubated at 35 C for 18e24 h. For the selective
enrichment of S. enterica, 100 mL of pre-enriched S. enterica in BPW
was inoculated in 10 mL Rappaport-Vassiliadis broth, and then
incubated at 42 C for 18e24 h. After incubation, broth cultures
were streak-plated onto brilliant green agar (BGA) and xylose lysine
deoxycholate agar (XLD), and then incubated at 35 C for 18e24 h.
Pink to red colonies in BGA and clear to pinkish red colonies (with
or without black center) in XLD were considered presumptive
S. enterica and were subjected to PCR-based identiÔ¨Åcation.

2.3. DNA extraction

Presumptive S. enterica were grown on nutrient agar overnight
at 35 C. After incubation, 3e5 colonies were harvested and sus-
pended in 100 mL TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Cell
suspensions were heated at 100 C for 10 min, and then cooled to
room temperature. Afterwards, cell suspensions were pelleted by
centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was
collected and then transferred into a new tube.

2.4. PCR-based identiÔ¨Åcation and characterization of S. enterica
isolates

PCR-based identiÔ¨Åcation of S. enterica targeting the invA gene
was performed as previously described by Ng and Rivera (2015)
with the following modiÔ¨Åcations: annealing at 60 C for 30 s and
extension at 72 C for 30s. For Salmonella O-serogrouping, a
multiplex PCR-based assay was adapted from Soguilon-Del Rosario
and Rivera (2015).
In the present study, the latest serogroup
designation was used: O:4 (B), O:7 (C1), O:8 (C2-C3), O:9 (D1-D4),
and O:3,10 (E1). For each run, a no template control (NTC) and a
positive control, S. Typhimurium UPCC 1360, was included.
Amplicons were analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis. BrieÔ¨Çy,
5 mL amplicons were loaded into 2% agarose gels containing
10,000  SYBR¬Æ Safe DNA Gel Stain (1:10,000). Amplicons were
allowed to separate at 100 V for 45 min, and then viewed in a gel
documentation system.

2.5. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

A total of 183 randomly selected S. enterica isolates were sub-
jected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the VITEK¬Æ 2
Compact system and VITEK¬Æ 2 AST-GN70 cards. Each card contains
16 antimicrobials including amikacin, ampicillin, ampicillin/sul-
bactam, aztreonam, cefazolin, cefepime, ceftriaxone, ciproÔ¨Çoxacin,
ertapenem, gentamicin, meropenem, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin/
tazobactam, tigecycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxa-
zole, and an extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) conÔ¨Årmation
test. For the antimicrobial susceptibility testing, S. enterica isolates
were grown in nutrient agar and incubated at 35 C for 18e24 h.
Three to four colonies were suspended in 3 mL of 0.45% sterile saline
solution using sterile applicator sticks. The turbidity was adjusted to
0.5 McFarland using DensiChek‚Ñ¢. Bacterial suspensions and test
cards were loaded in a cassette, and then loaded into the VITEK¬Æ 2
system. The cards were then automatically Ô¨Ålled with the bacterial
suspension, sealed, and then incubated at 35.5 C. The duration of
the analysis can take around 7e18 h where turbidity is automatically
measured at 15-min intervals using kinetic analysis. The VITEK¬Æ 2
system applies the most recent breakpoints published by the Clin-
ical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) in interpreting data.

2.6. Data analysis

Twenty-Ô¨Åve grams each of tonsil tissue and intestinal samples
were weighed in sterile aluminum foil. The samples were minced

abattoir (e.g. from farm or transport) was measured as the number
of Salmonella-positive jejunum (including contents and MLN).
Presence of S. enterica in both or either tonsils or jejunum indicates
contamination of the end product. Differences between observed
contamination in the jejunum and in the end product were
assessed using a paired T-test. The total contaminated end products
in accredited and locally registered abattoirs were compared and
the values were expressed in percentages. Fisher‚Äôs exact test was
used to determine the signiÔ¨Åcance of the difference between the
two types of abattoir. All data analyses were performed using SPSS
16.0. SigniÔ¨Åcance was determined to be P < 0.05.

3. Results

3.1. PCR-based detection and characterization of S. enterica from
slaughtered swine

A total of 333 S. enterica isolates were recovered from 108 out of
240 (45.0%) slaughtered swine. Multiple strains of S. enterica were
isolated from several samples. It is evident that there is an increase
in S. enterica contamination after slaughter where the number of
contaminated end products is always greater than the number of
contaminated jejuna regardless of the type of abattoir (Fig. 1).
Paired T-test revealed that there is a statistically signiÔ¨Åcant increase
in end product contamination in both accredited and locally
registered abattoirs (P > 0.034 and P > 0.049, respectively), sug-
gesting that an external factor contributes to the increase in
S. enterica contamination. Of the 150 swine from accredited abat-
toirs (A1-A5), 66 (44.0%) were positive for S. enterica. On the other
hand, 42 out of 90 (46.7%) swine slaughtered in locally registered
abattoirs (L1-L3) were carrying S. enterica (Fig. 1). Fisher‚Äôs exact test
revealed that there is no statistical difference between the observed
incidences of end product contamination in the two types of ab-
attoirs (P ¬º 0.42).

Serogrouping was conducted only on the isolates obtained from
140 tonsil and jejunum samples and revealed that 104 (74.3%) were
contaminated with a single serogroup of S. enterica. Most of these
samples were contaminated with S. enterica under serogroup
O:3,10 (51.0%) and O:7 (23.1%). Multiple serogroups were present in
36 (34.6%) samples (Table 1).

jected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing using VITEK¬Æ 2.

were non-susceptible to nitrofurantoin (93.4%), trimethoprim/sul-
famethoxazole (80.3%), and ampicillin (70.5%) (Table 2). Non-
susceptibility to the late cephalosporins ceftriaxone and cefepime,
and the Ô¨Çuoroquinolone ciproÔ¨Çoxacin was also observed.
Multidrug-resistance was found in 124 (67.8%) out of 183 isolates
(Table 3). While all of the multidrug-resistant isolates were resis-
tant to ampicillin, most of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin,
ampicillin/sulbactam, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Results
of the ESBL test were not shown as there are currently no ESBL
breakpoints for S. enterica set by the CLSI (2014).

4. Discussion

In swine, S. enterica is commonly isolated from the tonsils,
digestive tract, lymph nodes, and feces (Ng and Rivera, 2015).
Presence of S. enterica in the jejunum including its contents and the
MLN would indicate that the contamination was acquired before
the animals were brought to the abattoir (Botteldoorn et al., 2003).
To determine S. enterica contamination at the abattoir, tonsils were
collected since they are one of the Ô¨Årst organs to come in contact
upon ingestion of contaminated feedstuff or feces (Ng and Rivera,
2015).

In this study, 44.0% and 46.7% Salmonella-positive pigs were
detected from accredited and locally registered abattoirs, respec-
tively. While the incidence of S. enterica in swine slaughtered in
locally registered abattoirs was higher, the difference was not sta-
tistically signiÔ¨Åcant. Contrastingly, a recent study reported that the
incidence of Salmonella-positive pigs was signiÔ¨Åcantly higher in
locally registered abattoirs than in accredited abattoirs (Ng and
Rivera, 2015). This could be due to the difference in sample loca-
tions between the two studies. In the Philippines, accreditation of
abattoirs is based on the appropriate facilities and operational
procedures applied in the establishment. Abattoirs that have not
met these standards are supervised by the local government and
are only allowed to distribute meat within the city where the
establishment is located. The insigniÔ¨Åcant difference observed be-
tween the incidences of end product contamination in the two
types of abattoirs could reÔ¨Çect either poor implementation of
slaughter policies or contamination acquired during transport.
Whichever the case, abattoir accreditation may be disregarded as

either type has been found to yield essentially the same number of
contaminated end products. Such Ô¨Åndings must be addressed
because accredited abattoirs are allowed to distribute meat on a
national level. The risk that a multi-city Salmonella outbreak occurs
due to trade, as was observed in the multi-country Salmonella
outbreak involving Denmark, Norway, and Sweden (Bruun et al.,
2009), may not be unlikely.

Because of the risk of resistant bacteria due to the use of anti-
microbials on livestock production, numerous efforts have been
made to regulate the use of antimicrobial growth promoters
(AGPs). Sweden was the Ô¨Årst to impose a ban on AGPs in 1986,
followed by Denmark (Cogliani et al., 2011). The European Union
banned avoparcin in 1997 upon discovery of vancomycin-resistant
Enterococcus (Cogliani et al., 2011). Remaining AGPs were banned in
the European Union in 2006 (Cogliani et al., 2011; Maron et al.,
2013). Other countries, such as Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, and
New Zealand, also have a ban on AGPs (Maron et al., 2013; Van
Boeckel et al., 2015). However, in the United States, the use of
AGPs is only discouraged. While there is no ban on AGPs, the FDA
has issued voluntary guidelines to withdraw the use of medically
important antimicrobials in growth promotion (FDA, 2013). In the
Philippines, the use of chloramphenicol, carbadox, olaquindox,

nitrofurans, and human b-agonist drugs has been banned in live-
stock production.

To evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility of select S. enterica
isolates, we used the highly automated VITEK¬Æ 2 system which can
be used for identiÔ¨Åcation and antimicrobial susceptibility testing
(AST). It has an optical system which combines multichannel
Ô¨Çuorimeter and photometer readings and reads each test at 15-
minute intervals using kinetic analysis. The accuracy of VITEK¬Æ 2
AST for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria has been
evaluated in several studies (Garcia-Garrote et al., 2000; Gherardi
et al., 2012; Ligozzi et al., 2002; Ling et al., 2001). In this present
study, 183 randomly selected S. enterica isolates were subjected to
VITEK¬Æ 2 AST. Excluding the Ô¨Årst generation cephalosporin cefa-
zolin and the aminoglycosides amikacin, gentamicin, and tobra-
mycin, most
isolates were non-susceptible to nitrofurantoin
(93.4%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (80.3%), and ampicillin
(70.5%) (Table 3). Cefazolin and the aminoglycosides were excluded
because they are not clinically effective for Salmonella and must not
be reported susceptible (CLSI, 2014).

Nitrofurantoin is used to treat urinary tract infections.

In
contrast to other studies wherein nitrofurantoin non-susceptibility
in Salmonella from pork appears to be low to moderate (Ibar et al.,
2008; Yan et al., 2010), the present study reports a very high rate of
non-susceptibility despite its ban on food-producing animals more
than a decade ago. This would suggest that pig farmers do not
strictly adhere to veterinary policies set by the government.
Ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are antimicrobials
traditionally used to treat invasive non-typhoid salmonellosis
(Chen et al., 2013). In the Philippines, these antimicrobials are also
used as anti-infective agents in veterinary medicine which could
explain the high rates of non-susceptibility to ampicillin and
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Ampicillin- and trimethoprim/
sulfamethoxazole-resistant Salmonella have become increasingly
common which, in turn, present clinical dilemma in the treatment
of invasive salmonellosis (Chen et al., 2013).

The emergence of Ô¨Çuoroquinolone and ceftriaxone resistance
presents an even bigger problem since these are the drugs of choice
for non-typhoid salmonellosis in cases where ampicillin or
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is clinically ineffective (Chen et al.,
2013). In the present study, non-susceptibility to ciproÔ¨Çoxacin
(7.1%) and ceftriaxone (2.2%) was observed. For invasive Salmonella
infections that are resistant to both ciproÔ¨Çoxacin and ceftriaxone,

A.M.B. Calayag et al. / Food Microbiology 65 (2017) 51e56

carbapenems may be the last drug of choice (Chen et al., 2013).
However in the present study, non-susceptibility to ertapenem
(1.6%) and meropenem (0.5%) was also detected. While these iso-
lates were susceptible to ciproÔ¨Çoxacin, the possibility of acquiring
Ô¨Çuoroquinolone resistance due to mutation or horizontal gene
transfer should not be overlooked.

5. Conclusion

The incidence rates of S. enterica in swine end products from
both types of abattoirs in the present study appeared to be high.
Several factors can be considered to contribute to end product
contamination such as farms or origin of the animals, transport, or
the abattoir itself. While the abattoir has been identiÔ¨Åed as the
peak of S. enterica contamination (Arguello et al., 2012), we cannot
exclude the possibility that contamination was acquired during
transport from the farm to the abattoir. Collecting swabs from
transport trucks and at different points in the slaughtering process
(e.g. lairage, dehairing, evisceration) must be done in order to
determine exactly where the greatest risk of contamination occurs.
Nevertheless, our results show that high rates of S. enterica
contamination occur regardless of the abattoir accreditation. On
the other hand, the results of the antimicrobial susceptibility assay
suggest that antimicrobial use in swine farms be closely moni-
tored. While nitrofurantoin has long been banned for use in vet-
erinary practices in the Philippines, a high rate of non-
susceptibility to the agent was still observed suggesting that ef-
forts in the regulation of nitrofurantoin use by farmers was not
effective. The observed non-susceptibility to ciproÔ¨Çoxacin and
ceftriaxone, although low, is also alarming. Monitoring the anti-
microbial susceptibility of bacterial isolates from livestock animals
is therefore necessary to determine the effects of the withdrawal of
AGPs in the livestock industry and to identify emerging resistant
strains in the pork production chain.
