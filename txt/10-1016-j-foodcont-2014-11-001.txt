Here, we evaluated Campylobacter contamination on chicken carcasses and phenotypic and genotypic
proÔ¨Åles of antimicrobial resistance of the isolated strains. A total of 95 of samples were collected from 19
slaughterhouses from Minas Gerais - Brazil, and analyzed by MPN-PCR method. Campylobacter was found
in 16.8% of samples with microbial load ranging from 60 to 184 MPN/carcass. All isolates were resistant to
at least 5 (31.2%) of the antimicrobials screened using the disk diffusion method. Thr-86-Ile gyrA mu-
tation, blaOxA-61 and tet(O) genes were found in 95%, 100% and 40% resistant isolates to ciproÔ¨Çoxacin,
ampicillin and tetracycline, respectively. Almost all isolates (90%) showed the three genes required to
synthesize the CmeABC efÔ¨Çux system. The use of efÔ¨Çux pump inhibitor (PAbN) resulted in a signiÔ¨Åcant
reduction in the MICs of antimicrobials (2e128 fold), indicating the importance of efÔ¨Çux systems in
conferring antimicrobial resistance. Campylobacter were detected at low concentrations in Brazilian
chicken carcasses. However, high-levels of antimicrobial resistance were observed and associated with
several mechanisms. This study provides a baseline survey on contamination of Campylobacter in Bra-
zilian chicken carcasses and its antimicrobial resistance, giving support for actions directed at reducing
this pathogen in the food chain.

1. Introduction

Campylobacter spp. has been recognized as a major cause of
foodborne disease worldwide. In 2011 the European Food Safety
Authority (EFSA, 2013) reported that the total number of campylo-
bacteriosis cases was 220,209 in the European Union, and it has fol-
lowed a signiÔ¨Åcant increasing trend in the last years. In the United
States, this pathogen was the second most common infection with
14.3 cases reported per 100,000 population in FoodNet in 2012 (CDC,
2013). Although it is generally recognized that there are many
contamination sources of this pathogen, chicken meat and by-

products are the most important vehicles for human campylo-
bacteriosis (Humphrey, O'brien, & Madsen, 2007). Poultry are
considered natural reservoirs for this pathogen, and carcass
contamination occurs more frequently via crop leakage and intestinal
rupture during the evisceration stage in slaughterhouses (Smith
et al., 2007). A world literature survey showed that about 58% of
chicken carcasses and by-products are contaminated by Campylo-
bacter spp., but great variations in the Ô¨Åndings were observed (Suzuki
& Yamamoto, 2009). Despite the importance of this pathogen, the
epidemiological and risk assessment studies are recent in Brazil, and
there are no legal standards yet established for its presence or counts
in foods. Researches in this Ô¨Åeld become absolutely necessary in
Brazil because this country is the world's largest exporter of chicken
meat since 2004 and it is the third producer, surpassed only by United
States and China. The largest chicken meat producing states are
Parana, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul, S~ao Paulo and Minas
Gerais, according to the 2014 annual report of Brazilian Poultry

Association (UBABEF, 2014). More recently, concern regarding
Campylobacter contamination in foods has increased because of high
levels of antimicrobial resistance, including the frequent isolation of
multidrug-resistant strains (Mozina, Kurincic, Klancnik, & Mavri,
2011). Antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens isolated
from foods has been attributed to the indiscriminate use of antimi-
crobials in animal husbandry for preventive or therapeutic purposes
as well as for increasing the growth rate of animals (Alfredson &
Korolik, 2007). The dissemination of resistant Campylobacter to
other environments via livestock and foods of animal origin may
contribute to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in humans
and complicate effective clinical treatment of campylobacteriosis
(Aarestrup & Engberg, 2001). Multiple mechanisms for antibiotic
resistance are present in Campylobacter spp., which may be associ-
ated with mutational alteration or modiÔ¨Åcation of target molecules,
repression of uptake systems, activation of efÔ¨Çux pumps, and inac-
tivation of the antibiotic (Iovine, 2013). Among these, the CmeABC
efÔ¨Çux system plays a key role in resistance to a wide variety of
compounds including antibiotics, bile salts, dyes and detergents, and
has been broadly studied and characterized as a potential target to
reduce antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter spp. (Lin, Michel, &
Zhang, 2002).

Resistance of Campylobacter isolates from chicken and by-
products to antibiotics such as quinolones, macrolides, tetracycline
and ampicillin as well as the molecular mechanisms of this resis-
tance have been reported in several studies (Griggs et al., 2009;
Mackiw, Korsak, Rzewuska, Tomczuk, & Ro _zynek, 2012; Obeng
et al., 2012). However, there is a lack of information regarding the
molecular basis of antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter isolates
in Brazil. Most studies have focused on the prevalence of Campylo-
bacter in food and animals and its phenotypic proÔ¨Åles of antimi-
crobial resistance (Biasi, Freitas De Macedo, Scaranello Malaquias, &
Franchin, 2011; Kuana, Santos, et al., 2008; de Moura et al., 2013).
Therefore, to our knowledge, there are no published data about
genotypic resistance in Campylobacter isolates from chicken car-
casses in Brazil. The objectives of this study were to evaluate
Campylobacter contamination on chicken carcasses slaughtered in
Minas Gerais State - Brazil and to determinate phenotypic and
genotypic proÔ¨Åles of antimicrobial resistance of the isolated strains.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sample collection

A total of 95 chicken carcasses were collected from 19 slaugh-
terhouses localized in Minas Gerais state, Brazil, during January and
February 2012. This is the Ô¨Åfth largest producer and exporting
Brazilian state of chicken meat, surpassing 930,000 and 185,000
tons of carcasses produced and exported in 2013, respectively
(UBABEF, 2014). All selected establishments were representative of
slaughterhouses located in Minas Gerais state, Brazil, regarding
slaughtering frequency, numbers of slaughtered poultry and
geographical distribution into state. They were previously selected
by simple random sampling, representing 56% of the total number
of federally inspected slaughterhouses in this Brazilian state. Five
samples were randomly selected from each slaughterhouse after
the chilling stage. Each carcass was aseptically packed in a sterile
plastic bag and transported to the laboratory under cooled condi-
tions. Upon arrival at the laboratory, the carcass samples were
weighed and subject to Campylobacter enumeration.

2.2. Enumeration of Campylobacter spp

 1 polymyxin B and 2 mg l

 1 of cephalothin, 20 mg l

peptone water e BPW (Himedia, Mumbai, India), and vigorously
shaken by hand for 1 min. This chicken carcass rinse was serially
diluted (10-fold) using BPW and analyzed by the Most Probable
Number Method (MPN) as described by Scherer, Bartelt,
Sommerfeld, and Hildebrandt (2006a) with some modiÔ¨Åcations.
 1
BrieÔ¨Çy, aliquots of 1 ml from each dilution (direct homogenate, 10
 2) were brought into three MPN-tubes containing 9 ml
and 10
Preston Enrichment Broth Base (Himedia, Mumbai, India) con-
 1
taining 0.4% charcoal and supplemented with antibiotics (20 mg l
 1 of
of trimethoprim lactate, 15 mg l
 1 of amphotericin
vancomycin, 2.500 UI l
B e SigmaeAldrich, Saint Louis, USA) and 5% reductive solution FBP
(0.5% of ferrous sulfate, sodium metabisulÔ¨Åte, and sodium pyruvate
e Vetec, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). The MPN-tubes were incubated
under microaerobic conditions (approximately 2% H2, 5% O2, 10%
CO2 and 83% N2) at 42 C for 24 h using an anaerobic chamber
(Forma 1025 Thermo ScientiÔ¨Åc, USA). Then, 10 ml from each tube
were streaked onto Campylobacter Agar Base (Himedia, Mumbai,
India) supplemented as previously described for Preston broth.
After an incubation time of 48 h at 42 C under microaerobic
conditions, plates were examined for presence of presumptive
colonies. At least Ô¨Åve colonies per plate were selected, Gram
stained and examined by phase-contrast microscopy for typical
Campylobacter morphology. One colony per tube-NMP showing
typical cellular morphology was isolated and conÔ¨Årmed using po-
lymerase chain reaction (PCR). After molecular conÔ¨Årmation of
these colonies, the number of positive tubes at each dilution was
determined and the Campylobacter spp. counts present in the rinse
Ô¨Çuid and, consequently,
in the chicken carcass samples were
computed from the statistical MPN table of de Man (1983) (95%
conÔ¨Ådence interval).

2.3. ConÔ¨Årmation and species identiÔ¨Åcation

The isolates were conÔ¨Årmed and identiÔ¨Åed using genus- and
species-speciÔ¨Åc PCR assays. DNA extraction was carried out using a
boiled-cell method. Fresh cultures of isolates were suspended in
500 ml of sterile ultra-pure water and boiled at 95 C for 10 min.
After centrifugation at 13,000 g for 2 min, the supernatants were
collected and stored at  20 C until use as template DNA in the PCR
reactions. Primer sequences for the 16S rRNA gene were used to
conÔ¨Årm isolates as belonging to the Campylobacter genus. The
species were identiÔ¨Åed using primer sequences to detect hippuri-
case gene (hipO) speciÔ¨Åc for Campylobacter jejuni, and siderophore
transport gene (ceuE) speciÔ¨Åc for Campylobacter coli. AmpliÔ¨Åcations
were carried out in 25 ml reactions containing 2.5 ml of 10  PCR
 1 of deoxynucleoside triphosphate mix (ATP,
buffer; 0.2 mmol l
 1 of each primer; 2.5 U Taq PCR
GTP, TTP and CTP); 0.4 mmol l
polymerase (Promega, Madison, USA) and 2 ml of DNA preparation.
PCR reaction mixtures were heated at 96 C for 2 min as an initial
denaturation step followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 C for
30 s, annealing for 45 s and extension 72 C for 60 s, and a Ô¨Ånal
extension at 72 C for 5 min. The sequence of primers and annealing
temperatures are listed in Table 1. The ampliÔ¨Åed products were
electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide
 1) at 90 V for 40 min and visualized using a UV gel
(0.5 mg ml
documentation system (Quantum ST4 1100/26MX e Vilber Lour-
mat). A 100-bp DNA ladder (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) was
used as a standard for molecular size determinations.

2.4. Antibiotic susceptibility screening

Previously, each carcass was aseptically transferred into a new
sterile plastic bag, to which was added 200 ml of 0.1% buffered

The Campylobacter isolates were analyzed for antimicrobial
resistance using the agar disk diffusion method (CLSI, 2010). The
bacterial suspension was prepared in sterile saline solution (0.85%

625 nm equivalent to 108 CFU ml
were used to transfer the inoculum onto M H blood plates to
produce a conÔ¨Çuent lawn of bacterial growth. After the inoculum
the plates were dried, the antibiotic disks were distributed over the
inoculated plates and these were incubated at 42 C for 48 h under
microaerobic conditions. The standard disks (Laborclin, Brazil)
containing the following antibiotics were used in this assay: cip-
roÔ¨Çoxacin (5 mg); nalidixic acid (30 mg); chloramphenicol (30 mg);
tetracycline (30 mg); gentamicin (10 mg); imipenem (10 mg);

2.5. Detection of antibiotic resistance genes

All the Campylobacter spp. were tested for the presence of tet(O),
blaOxA-61, gyrA (Thr-86-Ile mutation), cmeA, cmeB, and cmeC genes,
representing resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin and quinolones,
and CmeABC efÔ¨Çux system components, respectively. Each ampli-
 1
Ô¨Åcation reaction consisted of 2.5 ml of 10  PCR buffer; 0.2 mmol l
of deoxynucleoside triphosphate mix (ATP, GTP, TTP and CTP);
 1 of each primer; 2.5 U Taq PCR polymerase (Promega,
0.4 mmol l
Madison, USA) and 2 ml of DNA preparation in a total reaction
volume of 25 ml. Simplex PCR assays for each gene were performed
using the following protocol: initial denaturation step of 96 C for

17
1 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 C for 30 s, speciÔ¨Åc annealing
temperature for 45 s, and 72 C for 1 min, and a Ô¨Ånal extension step
at 72 C for 5 min. The sequence of primers and annealing tem-
peratures are listed in Table 1. The various amplicons were elec-
trophoresed and visualized as previously described.

2.6. Effect of efÔ¨Çux pump inhibitor on antimicrobial resistance

To investigate the contribution of efÔ¨Çux systems to resistance to
ampicillin, tetracycline, ciproÔ¨Çoxacin (SigmaeAldrich, Saint Louis,
USA) and bile salts (50% sodium cholate and 50% sodium deoxy-
cholate) (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, USA), the minimum inhibitory
concentrations (MIC) of these antimicrobials were determined in
all isolates using broth microdilution method (CLSI, 2010) in the
presence and absence of phenylalanineearginine b-naphthylamide
(PAbN) (SigmaeAldrich, Saint Louis, USA), a well-known efÔ¨Çux
pump inhibitor. The resistance assays were carried out in the 96-
well microtiter plates containing a Ô¨Ånal volume of 100 ml per well
of Mueller Hinton broth (Himedia, Mumbai, India), with addition of
 1. Two-fold serial
testing agents and Ô¨Ånal inoculum of 105 CFU ml
dilutions of antibiotics and bile salts were performed in the 96-well
 1 and
plates for concentrations from 0.125 to 512 mg ml
 1, respectively. The PAbN was used to a Ô¨Ånal con-
0.05e25 mg ml
 1 deÔ¨Åned by a preliminary microdilution
centration of 5 mg ml
assay, and that had no inhibitory effects on bacterial growth for any
of the isolates. All of the MIC measurements were carried out in
triplicate, and positive and negative control wells were included.
The microtiter plates were incubated at 42 C for 48 h under
microaerobic conditions. Antibacterial activity was detected using a
colorimetric method by adding 30 ml of resazurin staining (0.01%)
aqueous solution in each well at the end of the incubation period
(at least 4 h before). The MICs were deÔ¨Åned as the lowest con-
centration of an antimicrobial where no metabolic activity is seen
after the incubation period, and they were determined by visual
observation on the basis of change in resazurin staining (living cells
e red; dead cells e blue) (Salvat, Antonnacci, Fortunato, Suarez, &
Godoy, 2001).

3. Results

A total number of 95 chicken carcasses from 19 slaughterhouses
were analyzed for the presence of Campylobacter spp. by the Most
Probable Number Method (MPN) associated with PCR conÔ¨Årma-
tion. Sixteen samples from nine slaughterhouses were contami-
 1
nated with microbial load ranging from 60 to 184 MPN carcass
(Table 2). The overall contamination of chicken carcasses with
Campylobacter spp. was 16.8%, while the variation in positive
samples between the slaughterhouses was 20e60%. C. jejuni was
the species most frequently isolated, representing 93.8% of the
positive samples, whereas C. coli was present in only one sample. A
total of 20 Campylobacter isolates made up of 18 C. jejuni and 2
C. coli isolates were obtained during sampling of typical colonies
grown on Campylobacter agar, corresponding to one isolate per
positive MPN-tube. An initial screening was performed to identify
the antimicrobial susceptibility of 20 Campylobacter strains against
16 antimicrobial agents by using the disk diffusion test. All isolates
were resistant to at least 5 (31.2%) of the antimicrobial agents tested
(Table 3). The highest resistance rates were noted for cephalospo-
rins (75e100%), ciproÔ¨Çoxacin (95%), nalidixic acid (95%) and
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (100%). A similar level of resis-
tance was found for tetracycline (50%) and ampicillin (45%),
whereas a lower frequency of resistance was observed toward
amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (10%). On the other hand, no resistance
to chloramphenicol, gentamicin, imipenem, cefepime or erythro-
mycin was observed in any of the isolates. From these data, we

Eight ampicillin-resistant isolates had a b-lactamase gene (blaOxA-
61), and this fact was also observed in ten sensitive isolates. More-
over, we also investigated the presence of the three genes that
encode the CmeABC efÔ¨Çux pump in Campylobacter spp. These three
genes, named cmeA, cmeB and cmeC, are arranged in an operon, and
encode for a periplasmic fusion protein, an inner membrane drug
transporter and an outer membrane protein, respectively. The cmeB
gene was found in all isolates, whereas cmeA was absent in two
isolates, one of which also showed no cmeC.

We used phenylalanine-arginine b-naphthylamide (PAbN) to
inhibit the CmeABC efÔ¨Çux system from Campylobacter isolates in
order to evaluate its effect on transport and resistance to antimi-
crobials. A correlation between this efÔ¨Çux system and resistance to
bile salts was observed for almost all isolates, whereas with other
antibiotics it was not so evident. Approximately 90, 55, 50 and 25%
of the isolates had transport of bile salts, ciproÔ¨Çoxacin, ampicillin
and tetracycline affected by PAbN, respectively. In combination
with PAbN, the MIC of ciproÔ¨Çoxacin, tetracycline and ampicillin
decreased from 2 to 8-fold for at least one of the isolates evaluated,
whereas for bile salts the decrease ranged from 2 to 128-fold
(Table 4). In addition, our results revealed that the absence of
cmeA and cmeC genes in two isolates did not inÔ¨Çuence the resis-
tance or transport of antimicrobials.

4. Discussion

Our results revealed low prevalence (16.8%) and low numbers
 1) of Campylobacter spp. in chicken carcasses
(60e184 MPN carcass
obtained from slaughterhouses from Minas Gerais state, Brazil.
However, high resistance levels were observed in isolates for most
of the antibiotics, which proved to be caused by different molecular
mechanisms. Campylobacter contamination rates in this type of
food vary widely among countries, including Brazil. In a study of 13
European Union member states performed in 2011, the chicken
carcass contamination rate was 31.3% on average, but ranged from
3.2% to 84.6% (EFSA, 2013). Likewise, a literature survey of studies
performed in Brazil also showed that the occurrence of Campylo-
bacter spp. in chickens and by-products is widespread and ranges
from 6.7 to 100% (Franchin, Ogliari, & Batista, 2007; Gon√ßalves,
Yamanaka, Almeida, Chano, & Ribeiro, 2013; de Moura et al.,
2013; Oliveira & Oliveira, 2013). These variations in the preva-
lence rates of Campylobacter may be attributed to poultry breeding
methods, hygienic practices during slaughter, sampling strategies
and differences in analytical methods (Daskalov & Maramski,
2012).

Although many studies have conÔ¨Årmed the prevalence of
Campylobacter in chicken carcasses, a quantitative risk assessment
of human campylobacteriosis depends on quantitative data, which
has been highlighted as a major hindrance in carrying out such an
assessment in developing countries (FAO/WHO, 2002). The choice
of most appropriate quantiÔ¨Åcation method depends on the ex-
pected level of Campylobacter in the sample examined and any
competitive bacterial Ô¨Çora that may be present (Son, Englen,
Berrang, Fedorka-Cray, & Harrison, 2007). In this study, we chose
to use the Most Probable Number Method (MPN) associated with
identiÔ¨Åcation of Campylobacter by using a species-speciÔ¨Åc PCR
technique, which proved to be more suitable for enumeration of
this pathogen in Brazilian chicken carcasses. Our results showed
that the concentration of Campylobacter spp. in chicken carcasses
was low and similar to results reported by Tang et al. (2010), Wong
et al. (2007) and Scherer, Bartelt, Sommerfeld, and Hildebrandt
(2006b), who found the contamination of most samples ranging
 1,
from <100 MPN g
respectively. However, even a low contamination of chicken car-
casses may be of concern to food safety authorities as because

selected three antibiotics (ciproÔ¨Çoxacin, tetracycline and ampi-
cillin) and bile salts for an investigation of the MICs and molecular
mechanisms contributing to antimicrobial resistance. Eight isolated
strains (40%) showed multi-drug resistance to ampicillin, tetracy-
cline and ciproÔ¨Çoxacin, and only one was sensitive to the three
antibiotics evaluated using the broth microdilution method
(Table 4). The MIC values of bile salts were highly variable, with
resistance rates between 0.390 and >25 mg ml

The results of phenotypic and genetic analysis of ciproÔ¨Çoxacin
susceptibility were sufÔ¨Åciently compatible, which was not
conÔ¨Årmed for
tetracycline and ampicillin. All ciproÔ¨Çoxacin-
resistant isolates had a point mutation Thr-86-Ile in gyrA gene of
DNA gyrase, except for one. In contrast, ten isolates were resistant
to tetracycline, but only four showed the tet(O) gene responsible for
the synthesis of a ribosomal protection protein that confers resis-
tance to the inhibitory effect of tetracycline on protein synthesis.

Campylobacter strains are highly infectious, with the infective dose
being as low as 800 cells (Black, Levine, Clements, Hughes, and
Blaser, 1988). A number of authors have quantiÔ¨Åed Campylobacter
on chicken carcasses using enumeration methods other than MPN,
and they observed that counts ranged from <1.0 to 8.0 log10 CFU
 1 (Chrystal, Hargraves, Boa, & Ironside, 2008; Figueroa,
carcass
Troncoso, Lopez, Rivas, & Toro, 2009;
Johnsen,
√òkland, Cudjoe, & Hofshagen, 2007; Kuana, Dos Santos, et al.,
2008; Stern et al., 2007). However, it is difÔ¨Åcult to compare re-
sults across studies, owing to the use of different materials and
enumeration methods, which consequently impedes the risk
assessment studies (Scherer et al., 2006a).

Johannessen,

The most prevalent species in this study was C. jejuni detected in
93.8% of positive Ô¨Åndings, similar to what has been observed in
other studies researching prevalence of this pathogen in chicken
and by-products (Garin et al., 2012; Tang et al., 2010; Zhao et al.,
2010). The higher rate of detection of C. jejuni in several studies
may be a reÔ¨Çection of the methods used, rather than the actual
incidence in food (Lynch, Cagney, Mcdowell, & Duffy, 2011). Besides
C. jejuni and C. coli, other Campylobacter species were not detected
by our study. Nonetheless, Campylobacter lari, Campylobacter
upsaliensis, Campylobacter concisus and Campylobacter fetus have
also been isolated from chicken and by-products in other studies,
even if at a lower frequency (Garin et al., 2012; Lynch et al., 2011).
Our study also represents one of the few reports on antibiotic
susceptibility of Campylobacter spp.
in chicken carcasses from
Minas Gerais, Brazil. We used disk diffusion test to perform an
initial screening in order to investigate antimicrobial resistance of
20 Campylobacter isolates against 16 antimicrobials. All Campylo-
bacter spp. evaluated in this study were resistant to at least Ô¨Åve
antimicrobials, thus characterized as multidrug-resistant isolates.
The percentage of antibiotics to which a particular isolate was
resistant ranged from 31% to 69%. We observed a generalized
resistance to Ô¨Årst- and second-generation cephalosporin, namely
cephalothin, cefoxitin and cefuroxime, whereas some isolates were
susceptible to third-generation cephalosporin, cefotaxime and
ceftazidime. Surprisingly, all isolates were susceptible to cefepime,

a fourth-generation cephalosporin. Similar results were observed
by Gritchina, Mishchuk, and Pozhalostina (2005), who demon-
strated high resistance of Campylobacter to the Ô¨Årst-generation
cephalosporins, and general susceptibility to cefepime. The ceph-
alosporins belong to a diverse class of compounds named b-lactam
antibiotics and individual differences among these molecules, such
as the amount and variety of side chains, may explain the variation
in antimicrobial resistance (Iovine, 2013). In addition, high resis-
tance of Campylobacter to b-lactams may be a consequence of se-
lective pressure caused by isolation and quantiÔ¨Åcation methods,
whose culture media are supplemented with antibiotics of this
class to inhibit enteric Ô¨Çora contaminants (Corry, Post, Colin, &
Laisney, 1995; Jacob, Mdegela, & Nonga, 2011).

Resistance to a large number of b-lactam antimicrobial agents is
becoming more widespread in foodborne bacteria,
including
Campylobacter (Li, Mehrotra, Ghimire, & Adewoye, 2007). Besides
cephalosporins, we evaluated the antimicrobial resistance of
Campylobacter to other b-lactams, including ampicillin, amoxicillin-
clavulanic acid and imipenem. We observed a high level of resis-
tance to ampicillin, which was similar to that reported in other
studies (Griggs et al., 2009; Obeng et al., 2012). In contrast, all
isolates were susceptible to imipenem, and most of them also to
amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. In previous studies, these antimicrobial
groups have also shown excellent in vitro activities against
Campylobacter spp. (Griggs et al., 2009; Hakanen, Lehtopolku,
Siitonen, Huovinen, & Kotilainen, 2003). Our results suggest that
these agents might be candidates for clinical trials in enteritis
caused by multi-drug resistant Campylobacter. Nevertheless, there
are few data on the clinical efÔ¨Åcacy of b-lactams for the treatment
of infections of this nature (Hakanen et al., 2003).

Campylobacter isolated in the present study were also suscep-
tible to gentamicin, erythromycin and chloramphenicol. Results
similar to ours were reported by other authors, who observed that
Campylobacter isolated from chicken were highly sensitive to these
three antibiotics (EFSA, 2012; NARMS, 2011; Zhao et al., 2010). In
contrast, higher resistances to these three antimicrobials were
observed by de Moura et al. (2013) and Nobile, Costantino, Bianco,

20

H.M. Hungaro et al. / Food Control 51 (2015) 15e22

Pileggi, and Pavia (2013) from Campylobacter isolated from chicken
carcasses in Brazil and Italy, respectively.

Alarmingly, we observed high resistance to quinolones (cipro-
Ô¨Çoxacin and nalidixic acid) and tetracycline. High levels of
Campylobacter resistant to these antibiotics have also been reported
by other authors (EFSA, 2012; Mackiw et al., 2012). The rates of
resistance to quinolones and tetracycline vary worldwide, and in
the last years the high prevalence of Campylobacter spp. resistant to
these drug classes has been increasingly frequent and worrying
(Alfredson & Korolik, 2007; EFSA, 2012; Mackiw et al., 2012). These
concerns have become more severe because Ô¨Çuoroquinolones and
tetracycline, along with macrolides, are used for treating human
infections (Mackiw et al., 2012; Obeng et al., 2012).

Overall, we observed both similarities and differences amongst
our results for antimicrobial resistance and those reported by other
authors. These variations in resistance proÔ¨Åles of Campylobacter
spp. might be expected, and occur due to the variations in the use of
antibiotics among countries, the origin and type of the samples, the
geographical distribution of resistant species and the methodology
applied to evaluate susceptibility (Wassenaar et al., 2009; Wilson,
2003; Zhao et al., 2010). The occurrence of high resistance rates
to some of the antibiotics investigated in this study could be
explained by their use as growth promoters in animal feed and
veterinary medicine (Iovine & Blaser, 2004), and reÔ¨Çects the extent
to which these antimicrobial agents are used in Brazil.

In order to investigate the molecular basis of antimicrobial
resistance of Campylobacter isolates, we evaluated the presence of
resistance and efÔ¨Çux system genes as well as the minimum inhib-
itory concentrations in the absence and presence of the efÔ¨Çux
pump inhibitor for three antibiotics selected and bile salts. Bile salts
were included in this last assay because their resistance in
Campylobacter has proved to be mediated by CmeABC efÔ¨Çux system
(Lin, Sahin, Michel, & Zhang, 2003). The high resistance to cipro-
Ô¨Çoxacin observed in this study was strongly correlated with the
Thr-86-Ile modiÔ¨Åcation of GyrA. This mutation is the main mech-
anism of resistance to Ô¨Çuoroquinolones in Campylobacter, and has
been frequently reported in other studies (Mackiw et al., 2012;
Wieczorek, Kania, & Osek, 2013; Zirnstein, Li, Swaminathan, &
Angulo, 1999). In our study only one isolate was resistant to cip-
roÔ¨Çoxacin and did not show the Thr-86-Ile mutation, and therefore
its resistance may be associated with other mechanisms, such as
other mutations in the gyrA, and multidrug efÔ¨Çux systems (Lin
et al., 2002; Luo, Sahin, Lin, Michel, & Zhang, 2003). On the other
hand, a relatively low percentage (40%) of the tetracycline-resistant
isolates showed the tet(O) gene, which encodes a protein that pro-
tects the ribosome from the inhibitory effect of this antibiotic (Dasti
et al., 2007). Low correlation between tetracycline resistance and
tet(O) gene was also observed by Obeng et al. (2012). Whilst, in other
studies high levels of phenotypic resistance to tetracycline were
attributed almost solely to presence of this gene (Mackiw et al.,
2012; Wieczorek et al., 2013). Beyond the tet(O) gene, nonspeciÔ¨Åc
efÔ¨Çux systems such as CmeABC multidrug efÔ¨Çux pump may
decrease susceptibility to tetracycline (Gibreel, Wetsch, & Taylor,
2007; Iovine, 2013).

Concerning the genetic basis of ampicillin resistance, all resis-
tant isolates showed the blaOxA-61 gene, which is associated with b-
lactamase production (Alfredson & Korolik, 2005). Griggs et al.
(2009) observed that 91% of the ampicillin-resistant isolates car-
ried the blaOxA-61 gene. However, it is worth noting that in our study
many susceptible isolates also showed this ampicillin resistance
gene. These results were in agreement with a previous observation
by Obeng et al. (2012). They reported that 10 of the ampicillin-
susceptible Campylobacter isolates from chicken were able to
encode the blaOxA-61 gene. Such Ô¨Åndings indicate that the blaOxA-61
gene in these Campylobacter isolates may has been inactivated or is

not being expressed. Beyond synthesis of b-lactamases, b-lactam
resistance may also be conferred by reduced uptake due to alter-
ations in outer membrane porins and efÔ¨Çux systems (Iovine, 2013).
Great variations in bile salts resistance were observed among
Campylobacter isolates, which was consistent with the Ô¨Åndings
from previous studies by Dzieciol, Wagner, and Hein (2011) and
Mavri and Smole Mozina (2013). The CmeABC efÔ¨Çux system plays a
key role in mediating bile salts resistance and is essential for
Campylobacter growth in bile-containing media such as the animal
intestinal tract (Lin et al., 2003). The observed difference in bile
salts resistance in our study could not be explained by failures in
the CmeABC efÔ¨Çux system, since most of the isolates showed the
three genes (cmeA, cmeB and cmeC) required for its synthesis, and
even the absence of some of them did not inÔ¨Çuence the levels of
resistance. Therefore, other mechanisms of resistance to bile salts
such as the presence of porins (Omp50 and PorA) and other efÔ¨Çux
systems (CmeDEF and CmeG) are probably involved in these results
(Akiba, Lin, Barton, & Zhang, 2006; Bolla, De, & Dorez, 2000; Bolla,
Loret, Zalewski, & Pages, 1995; Jeon, Wang, Hao, Barton, & Zhang,
2011).

The efÔ¨Çux inhibitor (PAbN) slightly decreased the MIC of cip-
roÔ¨Çoxacin, tetracycline and ampicillin, but did not restore the
susceptibility to either of them in the Campylobacter isolates. The
effects of PAbN were mostly of 2e4 fold MIC reduction for these
antibiotics. The activity of PAbN on quinolone resistance in C. jejuni
and C. coli is controversial. Our results showing the effect of PAbN
on ampicillin resistance were similar to those reported by Martinez
and Lin (2006), who observed that the MIC of b-lactams (cefotax-
ime and ampicillin) decreased 2-fold using this EPI. In another
study performed by Griggs et al. (2009) the presence of PAbN had
no effect on the MICs of b-lactams, including ampicillin, for the
Campylobacter isolates or their respective blaOxA-61 mutants. Simi-
larly, Corcoran, Quinn, Cotter, and Fanning (2005) have demon-
strated that PAbN did not produce a signiÔ¨Åcant decrease on the
resistance to quinolones in Campylobacter. However, signiÔ¨Åcant
decreases in the MIC of Ô¨Çuoroquinolones and restoration of sus-
ceptibility in Campylobacter isolates were reported by Kurincic,
Klancnik, and Smole Mozina (2012a). With regards to tetracy-
cline, Kurincic et al. (2012a) demonstrated that PAbN caused MIC
reductions of at least 2-folde64-fold, and this EPI also restored
susceptibility to some tetracycline-resistant isolates. In contrast,
lower effects of PAbN on tetracycline MIC (1.3e2.6-fold decrease)
were observed by Gibreel et al. (2007). Although our data, as well as
those from other studies, demonstrate a lack of efÔ¨Åcacy of PAbN in
reversing Ô¨Çuoroquinolone and tetracycline resistance, cmeB mu-
tants of Campylobacter have shown a signiÔ¨Åcant decrease in their
resistance to these antibiotics classes (Lin et al., 2002; Luo et al.,
2003). This fact suggests that the CmeABC system acts synergisti-
cally with other mechanisms to contribute to antimicrobial
resistance.

On the other hand, PAbN had a strong effect on bile salts resis-
tance in almost all isolates in our study, causing MIC reductions of
up to 128-fold. Other studies performed by Lin and Martinez (2006)
and Mavri and Smole Mozina (2013) also demonstrated that the
MICs of bile salts were dramatically decreased in the presence of
PAbN, around 16e512 fold and 2e64 fold, respectively. The
different effect of PAbN on susceptibility of antimicrobials indicates
that the inhibition occurs via binding site speciÔ¨Åc on the CmeABC
system and in a competitive manner, as suggested in previous
studies (Lomovskaya & Bostian, 2006). It has been proposed that
inhibition of multidrug efÔ¨Çux systems by EPIs is a novel approach to
enhance drug accumulation inside the bacterial cell, thereby
increasing bacterial susceptibility to antimicrobials (Lomovskaya &
Watkins, 2001). In recent years, some studies have been developed
in order to Ô¨Ånd out new compounds which exhibit such properties

5. Conclusion

This work provides a baseline study on Campylobacter contam-
ination and its antimicrobial resistance and molecular basis in
chicken carcasses in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Despite the low
prevalence and the low concentration of Campylobacter in chicken
carcass samples, the identiÔ¨Åcation of high levels of antimicrobial
resistance and multidrug-resistant isolates make this issue even
more serious. Our results point to the need for more frequent
monitoring of the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of
Campylobacter in order to provide support for actions directed at
reducing this pathogen in the food chain. In addition, we also
suggest that efÔ¨Çux pump inhibitors may be an important tool to
reduce the antimicrobial resistance and colonization of Campylo-
bacter in animals raised for food purposes.
