Abstract 
This  study  aimed  to  investigate  the  prevalence,  serotype  distribution,  and  antibiotic 
resistance,  and  to  characterize  the  extended  spectrum  β-lactamases  (ESBLs) 
producing  Salmonella  isolates  from  chicken  and  pork  meats  from  retail  markets  in 
Guangdong province, China. A total of 903 retail meat samples (475 chicken and 428 
pork meats) were obtained from six cities (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Heyuan, Shaoguan, 
Foshan, and Yunfu) of Guangdong province between May 2016 and April 2017. High 
levels  of  Salmonella  contamination  were  detected  in  chicken  (302/475,  63.6%)  and 
pork  (313/428,  73.1%).  Thirty-eight  serotypes  were  identified  in  615  detected 
Salmonella,  and  the  serotypes  varied  greatly  between  chicken  and  pork  samples. 
Agona  (55/302,  18.2%),  Corvallis  (45/302,  14.9%),  Kentucky  (38/302,  12.6%), 
Mbandaka (32/302, 10.6%) was the dominant serotypes in chicken samples. However, 
Typhimurium (78/313, 24.9%), Rissen (67/313, 24.1%), Derby (66/313, 21.1%), and 
London (48, 15.3%) were the most common in pork samples. High rates of antibiotic 
resistance  were  found  to  sulfisoxazole  (468/615,  76.1%),  tetracycline  (463/615, 
75.3%),  ampicillin  (295/615,  48.0%),  and  ofloxacin  (275/615,  44.7%).  Notably, 
antimicrobial susceptibility tests identified resistance to polymyxin B (12/615, 2.0%) 
and 
in 
Salmonella isolated from chicken (245/302, 81.1%) and pork (229/313, 73.2%).  The 
resistance  rate  of  different  Salmonella  serotypes  varied  widely.  Especially,  isolates 
such as Typhimurium, Agona, Corvallis and Kentucky exhibited highly resistance to 
antibiotics.  The  MDR  rate  of  Salmonella  isolates  from  chicken  was  significantly 
higher  than  that  from  pork  isolates  (P  <  0.05). Twenty-one  Salmonella  isolates  were 
identified  as  ESBLs-producing,  covering  six  Salmonella  serotypes  and  displaying 
different pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) genotypes. BlaOXA-1 was the dominant 
ESBLs  gene  (9/21,  42.9%),  followed  by  blaCTX-M-55  (5/21,  23.8%).  This  study 
indicated that Salmonella was widespread in chicken and pork from retail markets in 
Guangdong province and the isolates showed high multidrug-resistance, especially the 
known multidrug-resistant Salmonella serotypes. Therefore, it is important to focus on 
Salmonella  serotypes  and  strengthen  the  long-term  monitoring  of  MDR  Salmonella 
serotypes in animal-derived foods.

INTRODUCTION 
Salmonella  is  a  foodborne  pathogen  that  causes  morbidity  and  mortality  worldwide 
(Scallan  et  al.,  2011).  Until  now,  more  than  2,600  serovars  have  been  identified 
among Salmonella worldwide and almost all Salmonella can cause illness in humans 
and  animals  (Guibourdenche  et  al.,  2010).  In  China,  about  70  to  80%  of  foodborne 
disease  outbreaks  are  caused  by  Salmonella,  and  the  majority  of  diseases  are 
associated with the ingestion of contaminated livestock and poultry products (Wang et 
al.,  2007).  Animal-derived  foods,  especially  chicken  and  pork,  are  considered  the 
major reservoirs of Salmonella dissemination (Vo et al., 2006; Jackson et al., 2013).   
 

At  the  same  time,  antibiotic  resistance  of  Salmonella  is  also  one  of  the  most 
important public health problems worldwide. In recent years, studies have shown that 
because  of  long-term  antibiotic  use  during  animal  breeding,  antibiotic  resistance  has 
markedly  increased.  Multidrug-resistant  Salmonella  could  pose  a  serious  threat  to 
humans  through  the  food  chain  (Barza,  2002;  Lai  et  al.,  2014).  In  particular, 
extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing Salmonella have been frequently 
isolated  from  food  animals  in  many  countries, including  China  (Dahms  et  al.,  2015; 
Ben Said et al., 2016; Ibrahim et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2017). 

 
For animal-derived foods, tracking the source of Salmonella infections can help to 
identify  potential  problems  in  food  production,  processing,  preparation,  or  the  sales 
process to prevent the introduction of other pathogens into food (Swaminathan et al., 
2006;  Russell  et  al.,  2014).  Guangdong  is  a  livestock  production  and  consumption 
province;  furthermore,  Guangdong  is  China’s  foremost  livestock  production  area.  In 
2009,  laboratory-based  surveillance  for  Salmonella  infection  was  established  in 
Guangdong  Province,  which  mainly  monitors  the  prevalence  and  outbreak  of 
Salmonella in various hospitals (Deng et al., 2012). However, limited information on 
surveillance  studies  of  Salmonella  in  animal-derived  foods  from  retail  markets  in 
Guangdong is available, and there is a lack of epidemiological data.

The main aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, serotype distribution, 
antibiotic 
the  phenotype  and  genotype  of 
ESBLs-producing  Salmonella  isolated  from  chicken  and  pork  meat  from  retail 
markets in Guangdong. The results could lay the foundation for follow-up research for 
public health security and food safety problems caused by Salmonella.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Sample collection 
A total of 903 retail meat samples (including 475 chicken and 428 pork sample) were 
randomly collected from retail markets in six cities (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Heyuan, 
Shaoguan,  Foshan,  and  Yunfu;  chosen  from  three  retail  markets  in  each  district)  of 
Guangdong province between May 2016 and April 2017. Sampling methods were as 
follows: In Guangzhou City, different regions were sampled monthly; in other cities, 
samples were taken monthly from three selected retail markets. Samples were taken of 
different chicken types (i.e., whole chickens and chopped chickens), pork types (i.e., 
dressed pork) and during different seasons (i.e., spring, summer, autumn and winter). 
Each  sample  was  placed  in  a  sterile  plastic  sample  bag  and  transported  to  the 
laboratory on ice. All samples were analyzed on the day of their collection.

Salmonella  isolation  and  identification  was  performed  according  to  the  Standard 
ISO-6579 (International Organization for Standardization, 2002) method, as described 
previously (Yang et al., 2010; Ren et al., 2016) with some modifications. Briefly, 25 g 
of  samples  was  placed  into  a  sterile  plastic  bag  containing  225  mL  of  buffered 
peptone water and shaken for 3 min. The suspension was then cultivated at 37 °C in a 
Shaker  at  100  rpm  for  6–8  h  and  then  1  mL  of  the  suspension  was  added  to  10  mL 
Tetrathionate Broth and Rappaport–Vassiliadis soya broth and incubated at 42 °C for 
18-24  h,  separately.  After  selective  enrichment,  the  suspensions  were  streaked  onto 
xylose  lysine  tergitol  4  agar  and  CHROMagar™  incubated  at  37  °C  over  night. 
Isolates  with  typical  Salmonella  phenotypes  were  further  confirmed  using  API  20E 
test strips (bioMerieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France). 
 
Salmonella serotyping   
All  the  Salmonella  isolates  were  serotyped  according  to  the  White  Kauffmann  Le 
Minor  scheme  or  National  Food  Safety  Standard-Food  microbiological examination: 
Salmonella (GB 4789.4-2016) by slide agglutination, using specific O and H antisera 
(S&A Reagents Lab Ltd., Bangkok, Thailand). 
 
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and screening for ESBLs strains 
All Salmonella isolates were tested for antibiotic susceptibility using the Kirby-Bauer 
disk diffusion method, and the results were interpreted according to the standards of 
the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, 2013). 
 

Agar diffusion assays were performed on Muller-Hinton agar with disks containing 
18  different  antibiotic  agents  (Oxoid,  Basingstoke,  UK):  ampicillin  10  µg  (AMP), 
amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 30 µg (AMC), cefotaxime 30 µg (CTX), ceftazidime  30 
µg (CAZ), cefepime 5 µg (FEP), gentamicin 10 µg (GEN), streptomycin 10 µg (STR), 
amikacin  30  µg  (AMK),  sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim  23.75/1.25  µg  (SXT), 
sulfonamides  300  µg  (S3),  nalidixic  acid  30  µg  (NAL),  ofloxacin  5  µg  (OFX), 
ciprofloxacin  5  µg  (CIP),  florfenicol  30  µg  (FFC),  chloramphenicol  30  µg  (CHL), 
imipenem  10  µg  (IPM),  polymyxin B  300  IU  (PB),  and  tetracycline  30  µg  (TET)  . 
Escherichia  coli  ATCC  25922  and  ATCC  35218  were  used  as  quality  control 
organisms.  Isolates  exhibiting  resistance  to  three  or  more  antibiotic  classes  were 
defined as multidrug-resistant (MDR). 

P r o v i

 
The Salmonella isolates were screened for ESBLs production using cefotaxime and 
cefotaxime (30 µg)/clavulanic acid (10 µg) disks and ceftazidime and ceftazidime (30 
µg)/clavulanic  acid  (10  µg)  disks  (Oxoid)  according  to  the  double-disk  synergy  test 
method (Emery and Weymouth, 1997). Phenotypic presence of ESBLs of the isolates 
was  determined  by  detecting  enhancement  of  the  diameter  of  the  inhibition  zone  of 
the  clavulanate  disk  and  corresponding  β-lactam  antibiotic  disk.  If  there  was 
difference  of  ≥  5  mm  between  the  inhibition  zone  of  the  clavulanic  acid  and  the 
β-lactam antibiotic disk, the isolate confirmed as having a positive ESBLs phenotype 
(CLSI, 2013). 
 
PCR detection and DNA sequencing 
Salmonella isolates showing ESBLs phenotypes were further confirmed by PCR and 
DNA sequencing. ESBLs encoding genes detected included blaTEM, blaCTX-M, blaCMY, 
blaOXA, blaPSE, and blaSHV. The primers for the ESBLs encoding gene and the reaction 
conditions were as previously described (Li et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2016; Qiao et

al.,  2017).  The  PCR  products  were  stained  with  ethidium  bromide,  visualized  under 
UV  light  after  gel  electrophoresis  using  1%  agarose,  purified,  and  sent  to  Sangon 
Biotech  Co.,  Ltd.  (Shanghai,  China)  for  sequencing.  The  ESBLs  encoding  gene 
fragments  were  analyzed  and  aligned  at  GenBank  using the online  BLAST  software 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). 
 
Pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) 
ESBLs-producing  Salmonella  isolates  were  subtyped  by  PFGE  to  determine  their 
genetic  relatedness,  according  to  the  Pulse-Net  protocol  recommended  by  the  CDC 
(Ribot  et  al.,  2006).  PFGE  was  preformed  after  digestion  of  the  genomic  DNA  with 
the restriction enzyme XbaI, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Braenderup 
(CDC  no.  H9812)  was  used  as  standard  control  strain.  PFGE  results  were  analyzed 
using  BioNumerics  Software  (Version  5.1;  Applied-Maths,  Sint-Martens-Latem, 
Belgium). 
 
Statistical analysis 
The isolation rates and antibiotic resistance rates among the different food types and 
isolates  were  analyzed  using  the  Chi-squared  test  in  SPSS  Statistics  18.0  software 
(SPSS Inc., USA). A P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
 
RESULTS 
Prevalence and Serotypes of Salmonella 
In this study, a total of 615 Salmonella isolates (615/903, 68.1%) were recovered from 
the  meat  samples.  High  levels  of  Salmonella  contamination  were  detected:  302 
(302/475,  63.6%)  in  chicken  samples  and  313  (313/428,  73.1%)  in  pork  samples 
(Table 1). The isolation rate from pork was higher than that from chicken (P< 0.05).

P r o v i

Thirty-eight  Salmonella  serotypes  were  identified  among  the  615  Salmonella 
isolates (Table 1). More serovars were found in chicken samples (27 serovars) than in 
pork  samples  (25  serovars).  The  serotypes  varied  greatly  between  the  chicken  and 
pork samples. In the chicken samples, the most common serovars were Agona (55/302, 
18.2%), Corvallis (45/302, 14.9%), Kentucky (38/302,12.6%), and Mbandaka (32/302, 
10.6%);  and  in  the  pork  samples  they  were  Typhimurium  (78/313,  24.9%),  Rissen 
(67/313,  24.1%),  Derby  (66/313,  21.1%),  and  London  (48,  15.3%).  Importantly, 
serovar Rumford was detected in meat samples for the first time in China. 

 

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing 
The 615 isolated strains were tested for their susceptibility to 18 antibiotics (Table 2). 
The most resistance was to sulfisoxazole (468/615, 76.1%) and tetracycline (463/615, 
75.3%),  followed  by  ampicillin  (295/615,  48.0%),  ofloxacin  (275/615,  44.7%),  and 
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole  (248/615,  40.3%).  All  isolates  were  susceptible  to 
cefepime, ceftazidime, amikacin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Notably, the results 
showed very low rates of resistance to polymyxins and carbapenem antibiotics, such 
as polymyxin B (12/615, 2.0%) and imipenem (3/615, 0.5%).   
 

Resistance  to  ampicillin,  tetracycline,  streptomycin,  sulfisoxazole,  Florfenicol, 
Chloramphenicol, and Ofloxacin was frequently observed in the Salmonella serovars 
isolated  (Table  3):  588  (95.6%)  isolates  were  resistant  to  at  least  one  antibiotic  and 
474 (77.1%) were multidrug-resistant (MDR) (Table 4). Resistance to 4–9 antibiotics 
was detected in 331 isolates (53.8%), whereas 57 isolates (9.3%) were resistant to ≥

10 antibiotics. More of the serovars isolated from chicken showed MDR ≥ 3 (n=245) 
than  did  the serovars isolated from  pork  (n=229)  (P < 0.05). The MDR  rates  for the 
Salmonella  serovars  are  shown  in  Table  5.  Notably,  MDR  was  widespread  serovars 
Kentucky,  Typhimurium,  Derby,  Agona,  and  Corvallis  isolated  from  retail  meat 
samples.   
 
Prevalence of ESBLs-producing isolates and ESBLs genes 
Six  serotypes  were  detected  among  21  ESBLs-producing  Salmonella  isolates  (Table 
6). The most prevalent serotype was Indiana (7/21, 33.3%) followed by Typhimurium 
(5/21, 23.8%), Kentucky (3/21, 14.3%), Litchfield (3/21, 14.3%), Derby (2/21, 9.5%), 
Schwarzengrund  (1/21,  4.8%).  The  resistance  profiles  are  shown  in  Table  6.  Eight 
β-lactamases  and  ESBLs  encoding  genes,  including  blaTEM-1,  blaTEM-206,  blaTEM-214, 
blaCTX-M-15, blaCTX-M-55, blaCTX-M-64, blaCTX-M-123, and blaOXA-1 were identified in the 21 
ESBLs-producing  Salmonella  isolates  (Table  7).  Among  them,  42.9%  (n  =  9)  were 
found  to  harbor  blaOXA-1,  followed  by  blaCTX-M-55  (5/21,  23.8%),  blaTEM-206  (4/21, 
19.0%),  blaTEM-214  (4/21,  19.0%),  blaCTX-M-123  (3/21,  14.3%).  Moreover,  100%  of 
ESBLs-producing  isolates  carried  at  least  one  of  the  β-lactamases  and/or  ESBLs 
encoding  genes,  including  blaOXA-1  (n  =  9),  blaCTX-M-55 (n  =  5),  blaCTX-M-123 (n  =  3), 
blaTEM-206  (n  =  4),  and  blaTEM-214  (n  =  4).  Seven  isolates  (33.3%  were  detected  as 
carrying  two  β-lactamases  and/or  ESBLs  encoding  genes.  None  of  the  isolates  were 
positive for blaSHV, blaPSE, or blaCMY. 
 
PFGE 
Twenty-one  PFGE  patterns  were  identified  among  the  21  ESBLs-producing  isolates 
(Fig.  1).  Seven  ESBLs-producing  Indiana  isolates,  five  Typhimurium  isolates,  three 
Kentucky 
isolates  and,  one 
Schwarzengrund  isolate  were  analyzed  via  PFGE  with  the  enzyme  XbaI.  The  PFGE 
profile  analysis  demonstrated  that  Salmonella  of  the  same  serotype  isolated  from 
different  times  and  locations  have  markedly  different  genotypes.  Similarly,  serovars 
isolated from the same time and place also showed diverse genotypes.   
 
DISCUSSION 
We  found  the  high  levels  of  Salmonella  contamination  rate  in  chicken  (63.6%)  and 
pork  (73.1%)  collected  from  retail  markets  in  Guangdong  Province,  China.  These 
prevalences  were  significantly  higher  than  those  reported  in  similar  studies  in  other 
districts in China, such as Hebei (Yan et al., 2010), Sichuan (Li et al., 2013), Henan 
(Li et al., 2014), Beijing (Wang et al., 2014), Jiangsu (Bai et al., 2015), and Shandong 
(Cui et al., 2016). Meanwhile, the Salmonella contamination rate was higher than that 
of other parts of Asia, such as South Korea (Choi et al., 2015), Tokyo (Katoh et al., 
2015),  and  Northern  Vietnam  (Thai  et  al.,  2012),  and  higher  than  that  reported  in 
Egypt  (Gharieb  et  al.,  2015).  This  indicated  that  contamination  by  Salmonella  in 
animal-derived foods in Guangdong Province is more serious, which greatly increases 
the risk of humans being infected. The results suggested that Salmonella in livestock 
and poultry products should be a priority area for supervision in Guangdong Province. 
It  is  also  a  reminder  that  animal-derived  foods  in  the  tropics  should  be  paid  more 
attention and reflected the need for strengthening of the monitoring of Salmonella the 
animal-origin  food  supply;  for  example,  improving  environmental  sanitation  in  food 
processing  and  health  awareness  among  employees  should  be  enhanced,  and  the 
disinfection  management  of  processing  equipment  and  tableware  containing  food 
should be improved.

Thirty-eight Salmonella serovars were found in retail meat samples, among which, 
serovars  Typhimurium,  Rissen,  Derby  (pork),  and  Agona,  Corvallis,  and  Kentucky 
(chicken) were the most common serotypes, respectively. The serotypes found in the 
pork  samples  were  the  same  as  those  identified  in  previous  studies  in  China  and 
abroad (Liang et al., 2015). The distribution of  the  serotypes in the chicken samples 
was very different from those in other regions. It was reported that serovars Enteritidis 
and Typhimurium were two predominant serotypes in chickens from other regions (Li 
et  al.,  2017).  Interestingly,  Agona,  Corvallis,  and  Kentucky  were  reported  less 
frequently  in  previous  studies  (Arnedo-Pena  et  al.,  2016),  whereas  they  were  the 
dominant  isolates  in  the  current  investigation. Additionally,  serovar  Agona  is  one  of 
the  top  10  serotypes  responsible  for  nosocomial  infections  in  China  (Zhang  et  al., 
2014);  serovar  Corvallis  has  been  reported  in  Brazil,  Germany,  and  Turkey 
(Kocabiyik  et  al.,  2006;  Fischer  et  al.,  2013;  Yamatogi  et  al.,  2015);  and  serovar 
Kentucky  was  the  most  common  serovar  in  the  USA  (van  Duijkeren  et  al.,  2002; 
Galanis  et  al.,  2006).  The  results  suggest  that  Agona,  Corvallis,  and  Kentucky  may 
cause  public  health  concerns  in  Guangdong.  Importantly,  serovar  Rumford  was 
detected in animal-derived food for the first time in China. The detection of this strain 
not  only  fills  the  blank  of  the  bacterial  species  library  in  China,  but  also  provides  a 
new basis for diagnostic tests and epidemiological investigation of this strain. Notably, 
Typhimurium  is  the  most  frequently  isolated  serovar  from  infants  in  Guangdong 
(Deng et al., 2012). Therefore, further study is required to determine the source of this 
serovar  (Liang  et  al.,  2015;  O'Leary  et  al.,  2015).  Our  results  also  showed  that  an 
association might exist between Salmonella-contaminated food and the sample source. 
Guangdong  is  mainly  involved  in  yellow  broiler  production  and  its  breeding, 
production  mode,  and  climatic  conditions  are  different  from  those  in  other  regions, 
which might explain the different serotype distribution. Thus, China should strengthen 
yellow  chicken  monitoring  and  pay  attention  to  changes  in  serotypes  in  different 
regions.

The  susceptibility  results  showed  more  than  75%  of  the  Salmonella  isolates  were 
resistant  to  tetracycline  and  sulfisoxazole.  These  high  resistance  rates  reflect  their 
widespread use in animal feed and are consistent with other reports (Bai et al., 2015). 
In  addition,  resistance  to  florfenicol  and  chloramphenicol  in  47.0%  and  48.3%  of 
chicken  isolates,  in  30.7%  and  31.6%  of  the  pork  isolates  deserves  our  attention 
because resistance to  these antibiotics may cause human resistance. In this study, all 
of  the  Salmonella  isolates  were  susceptible  to  amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid  and 
amikacin,  possibly  because these antibiotics are not  used for therapeutic purposes in 
clinical veterinary medicine; this result was consistent with previous reports (Sinwat 
et  al.,  2015).  Different  serotypes  of  Salmonella  showed  different  resistance  rates.  In 
the present study, we observed a high prevalence of MDR Salmonella isolates among 
those isolated from  chicken and pork. Serovars Agona, Corvallis, and Kentucky  had 
higher  resistance  rates  to  the  third-generation  cephalosporins  (CTX,  CAZ)  and 
fluoroquinolones than did the serovars Rissen and Derby. Serovars Agona, Corvallis, 
and Kentucky also exhibited higher resistance rates to ofloxacin. They also provided 
more 
or 
fluoroquinolones-resistant Salmonella. The increasing prevalence of MDR Salmonella 
involving multiple resistances to various antibiotics could cause Salmonella to evolve 
towards becoming a super bacteria (Campioni et al., 2014). The association between 
antibiotic  resistance  and  specific  serotypes  should  that  Kentucky,  Typhimurium, 
Corvallis,  and  Agona  were  strongly  associated  with  MDR  phenotypes.  In  addition,

resistant  strains  were  found  for  first  line  of  drug  used  in  human  medicine,  such  as 
Carbapenems and Polymyxins, which showed that Salmonella had a tendency toward 
drug resistance Hence, there is a need to strengthen epidemiological investigations of 
Salmonella  infections  and  further  studies  are  required  to  improve  our  knowledge 
concerning the development of MDR.

In  the  present  study,  the  most  commonly  detected  ESBLs  encoding  genes  were 
(encoding 
OXAs 
cefotaximases;  23.8%).  This  was  similar  to  the  results  of  previous  studies  in  which 
CTX-M-  types  were  the  main  family  of  ESBLs  (Nguyen  et  al.,  2016;  Qiao  et  al., 
2017).  Furthermore,  reports  indicated  that  CTX-Ms  have  been  disseminating  rapidly 
among  populations  of  gram-negative  bacteria  in  clinical  settings  in  recent  years 
(Shahid  et al.,  2009). The 21  ESBLs-producing isolates  identified in this study were 
subjected  to  PFGE  analysis.  The  resultant  dendrograms  of  isolate  patterns  showed 
clusters with a high level of diversity. This indicated that the Salmonella prevailing in 
Guangdong's  retail  market  during  this  period  not  comprised  diverse  serotypes,  but 
also  strains  of  the  same  serotype  have  more  complex  genotypes  and  exhibit  diverse 
features.  Thus,  we  should  pay  attention  to  this  easily  overlooked  repository  of 
multidrug-resistant  genes,  and  to  the  food  safety  issues  they  invoke  in  terms  of 
consumers'  health.  Moreover,  more  research 
the 
dissemination of Salmonella and antibiotic resistance genes is warranted. 
 
CONCLUSION 
In conclusion, our results indicated the diversity of Salmonella serotypes and the high 
prevalence  and  antibiotic  resistance  that  existed  among  Salmonella  recovered  from 
chicken and pork meat at retail markets. In particular, multidrug-resistant Salmonella 
serotypes Agona, Corvallis, and Kentucky may indicate the potential risk of resistant 
Salmonella foodborne infections in Guangdong, China. Thus, this study suggests that 
epidemic  trends  information  about  the  Salmonella  serovars  in  Guangdong  province 
should be further monitored and studied.
