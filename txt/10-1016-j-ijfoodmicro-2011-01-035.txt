Antimicrobial resistance

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance and molecular epidemiology of
Campylobacter coli isolated from swine in China. A total of 190 C. coli isolates obtained from two slaughter houses
and ten conventional pig farms in Shandong (SD, n=95) and Ningxia (NX, n=95) provinces were tested for their
susceptibility to 14 antimicrobials. A high prevalence (N95%) of ciproﬂoxacin and tetracycline-resistant strains
was observed in both SD and NX. The erythromycin and clindamycin resistance rates of C. coli from NX (ERY: 54.7%
CLI: 43.2%) were higher than those from SD (ERY: 37.9%, CLI: 35.8%). A signiﬁcant difference (Pb 0.05) was
observed in erythromycin resistance rate, but not (PN0.05) in clindamycin resistance rate. while the resistance
rates of ampicillin and kanamycin in NX (AMP: 34.7%, KAN: 43.2%) were signiﬁcantly lower (P b0.05) than those in
SD (AMP: 51.6%, KAN: 71.6%). None of the tested isolates were resistant to phenicols. The majority of the isolates
from both provinces (SD: 80% and NX: 73.7%) showed multi-drug resistance proﬁles. The point mutations of
A2075G in the 23S rRNA and C257T in the gyrA gene were detected in 98% (87/89) of macrolide resistant isolates
and all ciproﬂoxacin resistant isolates, respectively. In addition, all tetracycline-resistant isolates harbored the tet
(O) gene. The high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in C. coli strains derived from pigs in China was observed
and was likely due to the extensive use of various antimicrobials. Prudent use of antimicrobial agents on farms
should be further emphasized to control the dissemination of antimicrobial resistant C. coli.

1. Introduction

Campylobacter is one of the most common food-borne pathogens
causing bacterial diarrhea in humans. Campylobacter jejuni and
Campylobacter coli are the main species responsible for most Campylo-
bacter infections (Alfredson and Korolik, 2007). The majority of the
infections caused by Campylobacter are self-limiting, however, antimi-
crobial treatments are required for Campylobacter infections causing
appendicitis, bacteremia, or other severe complications (Luber et al.,
2003). As enteric organisms, Campylobacter spp. are exposed to
antimicrobial agents that are widely used to control, treat and prevent
diseases in food producing animals. Under the selection pressures of
antimicrobials, antibiotic resistant Campylobacter emerges and can be
transmitted to humans through the food chain, which potentially
compromises the efﬁcacy of antimicrobial treatment of human infec-
tions (Desmonts et al., 2004; Piddock et al., 2008).

As an important Campylobacter species associated with food-borne
diseases, C. coli isolates show higher levels of resistance than C. jejuni
isolates (Bywater et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2010; Van Looveren et al.,
2001). Pigs were considered the primary reservoir of C. coli (Harvey et al.,
1999; Thakur and Gebreyes, 2005a,b), and multiple studies have
reported the prevalence of antimicrobial resistant C. coli from pigs in
both developed countries and developing countries (Bywater et al., 2004;
Ishihara et al., 2006; Padungtod et al., 2006; Payot et al., 2004a,b; Pezzotti
et al., 2003; Sáenz et al., 2000; Schuppers et al., 2005; Shin and Lee, 2007;
Thakur and Gebreyes, 2005a,b; Varela et al., 2007). However, no data
have been reported on the prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility proﬁle
and antimicrobial resistance mechanism of C. coli isolates from pigs in
China. In this study, we analyzed 190 C. coli isolates collected from swine
slaughter houses and conventional pig farms in Shandong (East China)
and Ningxia (West China) provinces.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Origin and identiﬁcation of Campylobacter isolates

A total of 1143 samples were collected from ten conventional pig
farms and two pig slaughter houses in Shandong (SD) (six conventional

S.-S. Qin et al. / International Journal of Food Microbiology 146 (2011) 94–98

95

pig farms and one pig slaughter house) and Ningxia (NX) (four
conventional pig farms and one pig slaughter house) provinces during a
period from November 2008 to June 2009 (Table 1).

The fresh feces (farm origin) and intestinal contents (slaughter plant
origin) were placed on ice and transported to the laboratory within 5 h
of collection and cultured for Campylobacter species. Samples (loopful,
approximately 10 μl) were plated directly onto Campylobacter Selective
Agar (Base) (Oxoid Lte., Basingstoke, England) containing 5% fresh
sterile deﬁbrinated sheep blood and Campylobacter supplement III
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), (Chen et al., 2010; Thakur and
Gebreyes, 2005a,b) and then incubated under microaerobic conditions
(CO2:10%, O2:5%, N2:85%) at 42 °C for 48 h. Presumptive Campylobacter
colonies were selected for further identiﬁcation by using API-Campy
(BioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) kits and PCR strategies as
previously described (Keramas et al., 2003; Linton et al., 1997). All the
isolates were stored in 20% glycerol-Mueller–Hinton broth at −80 °C
until further required for use.

2.2. Antibiotic susceptibility testing

The standard agar dilution method as described by Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, 2008) was used to determine the
Minimal
inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Campylobacter to 14
antibiotic agents including nalidixic acid, ciproﬂoxacin, enroﬂoxacin,
levoﬂoxacin, erythromycin, azithromycin, tetracycline, doxycycline,
gentamicin, kanamycin, ampicillin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol and
ﬂorfenicol. All the antimicrobial agents except nalidixic acid (Sigma)
were obtained from the China Institute of Veterinary Drug Control
(Beijing, China). The MIC ranges of antimicrobial agents and the
resistance breakpoints for all antimicrobial agents are summarized in
Table 2. C. jejuni ATCC33560 and C. coli ATCC33559 were used as
quality control strains. A C. coli isolate resistant to three or more
classes of antimicrobials was deﬁned as a multi-drug resistant isolate.

2.3. Detection of resistance determinants

According to the MIC results, antimicrobial resistant isolates were
selected to analyze the genetic determinants associated with quinolone,
macrolide, or tetracycline resistance. Mismatch ampliﬁcation mutation
assay (MAMA) - PCR was employed to detect the mutations of A2074C
and A2075G in 23S rRNA gene responsible for macrolide resistance
(Alonso et al., 2005) and the C257T (Thr-86-Ile) mutation in the
quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) associated with high-
level quinolone resistance (Zirnstein et al., 2000). A 505 bp gyrA QRDR
region and a 697 bp 23s rRNA region containing the resistance associated
mutations were ampliﬁed and sequenced (Alonso et al., 2005; Zirnstein
et al., 2000). The negative and positive controls for MAMA PCR were
designed according to the sequencing results. In addition, the tet(O) gene
was examined by PCR in all tetracycline-resistant C. coli strains. The
primers tet(O)-F:5′-AGTTTCTGCAAAGGATGGCAT-3′ and tet(O)-R:5′-

GATTGACCTTCAGGCGTTGAT-3′ were designed from the conserved
regions of tet(O) gene in Campylobacter spp. The PCR mixture contained
25 μl Premix Taq™ (ea. 0.4 mM dNTP Mixture, 4 mM Mg2+, and 1.5 U of
Ex Taq™ DNA polymerase, TaKaRa), 0.5 μM of each forward and reverse
primer (1 μl each) and 1 μl of DNA template (ca. 100 ng of genomic DNA)
prepared by the boiling method, and water was added for a ﬁnal PCR
mixture of 50 μl. PCR was performed on a veriti 96 well Thermal Cycler
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with the following cycling
condition: Initial activation at 94 °C for 5 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s,
58 °C for 35 s, and 72 °C extension for 45 s, and a ﬁnal extension at 72 °C
for 8 min.

2.4. Statistical analysis

Prevalence and frequency of antimicrobial resistance proﬁles of
C. coli isolates obtained between SD and NX were compared by using
the chi-square test at a P signiﬁcance level of 0.05.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Campylobacter prevalence

A total of 192 (16.8%) Campylobacter isolates including 190 C. coli
and 2 C. jejuni strains were obtained from 1143 collected samples after
identiﬁcation. The overall isolation rate of C. coli was 16.6%. Prevalence
of C. coli in SD (13.4%) and NX (21.4%) were signiﬁcantly different
(P b0.01), and the isolation rates varied greatly from region to region,
ranging from 8.6 to 24.6%.(Table 1) Overall, more than 98.9% of our
isolates were C. coli, which was consistent with previous ﬁndings that
pigs mainly harbor C. coli (Thakur and Gebreyes, 2005a,b).

3.2. MIC and resistance determinants of C. coli

The distribution of MIC values at which 50% and 90% of C. coli
growth was inhibited is summarized in Table 2. The resistance to
ciproﬂoxacin (SD: 99%, NX: 95.8%) and tetracycline (SD: 99%, NX:
95.8%) was high among the 190 C. coli isolates. Isolates obtained from
SD (n=95) exhibited signiﬁcantly higher resistance rates against
levoﬂoxacin (91.6%) than isolates from NX (n=95) (60%) (P b0.01).
The frequency of ciproﬂoxacin and tetracycline-resistant C. coli
was over 95% from both provinces evaluated, which was only similar
to that of Spain (CIP: 100% TET:94.4%) (Sáenz et al., 2000), but higher
than that of Canada (CIP: 2.4% TET:63.7%) (Varela et al., 2007), Korea
(CIP: 83.3% TET:56.1%) (Shin and Lee, 2007), Thailand (CIP: 86%
TET:81%) (Ekkapobyotin et al., 2008), Italy (CIP: 36.2% TET:76.6%)
(Pezzotti et al., 2003), Sweden (CIP: 21.1% TET: 1.9%) (Bywater et al.,
2004) and Switzerland (CIP: 26.1% TET:9.4%) (Schuppers et al., 2005).
Fluoroquinolones are widely used for treatment and disease control
in the pig production in China.
It has been documented that
ﬂuoroquinolone-resistant mutants can develop rapidly during treatment

aBoldface numbers indicate breakpoints for antimicrobial resistance. MIC breakpoints for Campylobacter for ciproﬂoxacin, nalidixic acid, erythromycin, azithromycin, clindamycin,
tetracycline, doxycycline, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, ﬂorfenicol were described by the NARMS Annual Report 2005. The breakpoints for enteric bacteria for ampicillin and
kanamycin were also from the NARMS Annual Report 2005. MIC breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae for levoﬂoxacin and enroﬂoxacin were recommended by CLSI (2008).
bTest ranges were based on the approved CLSI (2008) standards for Campylobacter.
c SD: isolates were collected in Shandong (SD) (n=95); NX: isolates were collected in Ningxia (NX) (n=95).

and lead to the emergence of ﬂuoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter
(Luangtongkum et al., 2009). In addition, ﬂuoroquinolone-resistant
clones could persist stably for long periods in the absence of
antimicrobial selection pressure and may outcompete susceptible clones
(Luangtongkum et al., 2009), which was another possible reason that a
high ﬂuoroquinolone resistance rate was observed among C. coli isolated
from pigs in both provinces in this study. The point mutation C257T (Thr-
86-Ile) in QRDR of the gyrA gene was considered the main mechanism for
high-level resistance to ﬂuoroquinolone in Campylobacter (Piddock et al.,
2003). This mutation was found in all of the 185 ciproﬂoxacin resistant
isolates (SD: n=94 and NX: n=91) with the MICs ranging from 4 to
64 μg/ml in our study. Furthermore, 20 C. coli isolates were randomly
chosen from the ciproﬂoxacin resistant isolates for sequencing the QRDR
region. The sequencing results showed that no other amino acid
mutations like Asp-90, Ala-70, and Pro-104 (Payot et al., 2006; Piddock
et al., 2003) in QRDR region linked to ciproﬂoxacin resistance were
detected except for the Thr-86-Ile change. Only two silence mutations in
QRDR region were detected at position 157 (serine; AGC replaced by
AGT, detected in all sequenced isolates) and position 99 (Phenylalanine;
TTT replaced by TTC, detected in half of the sequenced isolates).

Tetracyclines were commonly used as feed additives in conventional
pig farms in China, and tetracycline resistance is usually associated with
the tet(O) gene located either on chromosome or on transmissible
plasmids in both C. coli and C. jejuni (Pratt and Korolik, 2005). All of the
185 tetracycline-resistant isolates (SD: n=94 and NX: n=91) with
MICs ranging from 32 to ≥128 μg/ml harbored the tet(O) gene as
determined by PCR. This gene was highly prevalent among the
tetracycline-resistant isolates examined in this study, suggesting that
the high resistance rates to tetracycline was due to the presence of the
tet(O) gene in the isolates.

The prevalence of macrolide resistance was signiﬁcantly higher in
NX (55%) than in SD (38%) (P b0.05). The frequency of erythromycin

resistant C. coli observed in this study (SD: 38%, NX: 55%) was lower
than that found in Canada and Spain (Sáenz et al., 2000; Varela et al.,
2007), but comparable with the ﬁndings reported in other countries (e.g.
US, Italy, Belgium, Japan and Korea) (Ishihara et al., 2006; Pezzotti et al.,
2003; Shin and Lee, 2007; Thakur and Gebreyes, 2005a,b; Van Looveren
et al., 2001). In addition, most of the erythromycin resistant isolates (100%
in SD and 94% in NX) in this study demonstrated high-level resistance to
erythromycin (MIC≥128 μg/ml). The point mutation A2075G in 23S
rRNA was associated with high-level (MIC≥128 μg/ml) erythromycin
resistance and mutation A2074T/C was responsible for low-level
erythromycin resistance in Campylobacter (Payot et al., 2006). No
A2074C mutations were detected among the 89 erythromycin resistant
C. coli isolates, however, most of the erythromycin resistant C. coli isolates
(87 out of 89 isolates; NX: n=53, SD: n=36) except ZC113 and YC18
harbored A2075G mutations in their 23S rRNA gene as determined by
using MAMA PCR. Sequencing of the two A2075G negative isolates
revealed no mutations in their 23S rRNA gene, which is consistent with
the results of MAMA PCR. In addition, no mutations were detected in the
rplD and rplV genes encoding L4 and L22 proteins in the two strains (data
not shown). Further investigations are required to study whether the
CmeABC efﬂux pump (Cagliero et al., 2006) or other unknown
mechanisms contribute to the high-level resistance to macrolide in the
two isolates. The resistance rate of clindamycin (36% in SD and 43% in NX)
in the C. coli strains was similar to that of erythromycin (38% in SD and 55%
in NX), which could be explained by cross-resistance between erythro-
mycin and clindamycin in Campylobacter (Varela et al., 2007).

All 190 C. coli isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol and
ﬂorfenicol. Both MIC50 and MIC90 of the two antimicrobials were lower
than their breakpoints of MIC. The resistance rates for gentamicin were
similar in both provinces (SD: 23.2% and NX: 24.2%), which showed
relative low level compared with other antimicrobials except phenicols
in our test.

Isolates obtained in SD (n=95) exhibited signiﬁcantly higher
resistance rates against kanamycin (71.6%) than isolates from NX
(n=95) (43.2%) (Pb0.01), and similar observation was found in
ampicillin resistant C. coli. (SD: 51.6%, NX: 34.7%) (Pb0.05). The
difference of antimicrobial agents used for treatment in conventional
swine production practice in different provinces may have contributed
to the difference resistance rates between the two provinces. We
observed that all gentamicin resistant isolates showed resistance to
kanamycin. Furthermore, all of the kanamycin resistant C. coli isolates
were resistant to tetracycline. The coexistence of the kanamycin
resistant aphA-3 gene and tetracycline-resistant tet(O) gene on the
same plasmids may explain the association of the antibiotic resistance
(Gibreel et al., 2004). The genetic basis for ampicillin resistance was not
investigated in this study and the potential implication of β-lactamase
genes in the C. coli strains needs further investigation.

3.3. Multi-drug resistance proﬁle

A high proportion (146 out of 190) of the C. coli (76.8%) isolates
was multi-drug resistant strains (MDRS), which displayed as many as
19 resistance patterns. Different multi-drug resistance patterns (19 in
total) of C. coli isolates from SD and NX were summarized in Table 3. In
general, the frequency of MDRS observed in SD (80%) and NX (73.7%)
were not signiﬁcantly different (P N0.05). The rate of MDRS in this
study was much higher than those reported from Korea (56.1%) (Shin
and Lee, 2007), Canada (29.7%) (Varela et al., 2007), France (37%)
(Payot et al., 2004a,b), and the UK (3.8%) (Randall et al., 2003). The
predominant resistance pattern of the isolates from SD was
quinolone–kanamycin–tetracycline (68/76 MDRS; 89.5%), while
quinolone–macrolide–tetracycline (50/70 MDRS; 71.4%) was the
predominant pattern among MDRS from NX. The difference in
major multi-drug resistance patterns between two provinces might
be due to different preferences with regard to the use of antimicro-
bials in each province. In this study, 45.3% of the MDRS showed the
quinolone–macrolide–tetracycline (QMT) resistance pattern, which
was the most common pattern reported previously (Payot et al.,
2004a,b; Thakur and Gebreyes, 2005a,b). Acquired resistance to

multiple antimicrobials was associated with over expression of multi-
drug resistant efﬂux pumps or possession of multiple resistance
determinants (Quinn et al., 2007). Payot et al. (2004a,b) described
overexpression of CmeB in a number of C. coli MDRS from pigs, but the
expression level of cmeABC in the isolates obtained in this study was
not determined and remains to be examined in future work.

In conclusion, our study represents the ﬁrst report on the high
prevalence of antimicrobial resistant C. coli isolated from pigs in China.
Notably, many of the isolates are resistant to multiple antimicrobial
agents with high MIC values. The high prevalence of antimicrobial
resistance in the C. coli isolates suggests a high antibiotic selection
pressure in the swine production system. Thus, prudent measures
should be implemented to reduce the emergence, transmission and
persistence of antimicrobial resistant C. coli.
