This  study  was  conducted  to  analyze  the  prevalence  and 
quantitative loads of Salmonella spp. on pig farms in Chiang 
Mai,  Lamphun,  Thailand  to  assess  loading  levels  before 
slaughtering. The serotype diversity, antimicrobial-resistance 
pattern  and  pulse-field  type  of  Salmonella  spp.  were  also 
characterized  to  assess  the  dynamic  propagation  of  the 
pathogen.  The  Salmonella-positive  prevalence  was  246/805 

(30.56%), and the quantitative loads varied from 1.48∼4.04 

Log10MPN/g, with a mean ±  standard deviation of 2.11 ±  0.57. 
AMP/S/TE  (ampicillin/streptomycin/tetracycline)  was  the 
highest frequency antimicrobial resistance pattern found in 
this  study.  In  addition,  Salmonella  Rissen  was  the  primary 
serotype in this region. PFGE results indicated the occurrence 
of  infection  by  cross  contamination  among  pig  farms.  Our 
study  showed  that  pork  is  easily  contaminated  with  this 
pathogen.  Farm  control  programs  must  be  based  on  strict 
biosecurity  and  hygienic  measures,  which  could  further 
reduce  the  contamination  pressure  at  slaughterhouses  or 
retail shops.

Introduction

  Salmonella  spp.  comprises  one  of  the  most  important 
bacterial-zoonotic  pathogens,  causing  acute  food-borne 

diseases  in  humans  [28],  and  is  recognized  as  a  major 
public health problem [10]. Salmonellosis is the group of 
clinical  conditions  caused  by  Salmonella  spp.,  and  an 
estimated 80.3 million cases of foodborne Salmonellosis 
occur worldwide annually [23]. Clinically, Salmonellosis 
in humans may start with an acute onset of fever, nausea, 
headache, vomiting and profuse diarrhea within 8∼48 h of 
ingesting the pathogen. The severity of the disease depends 
on the ingested dose and the host’s immune status [14]. 
Although  contaminated  eggs  and  raw  or  undercooked 
poultry  are  the  primary  sources  of  Salmonellosis  in 
humans, pork causes an estimated 15∼20% of all cases 
[16]. While contamination can occur during any process 
along the food production line [1,21], infected pigs on the 
farm are the origin of the contaminated pork that leads to 
human infections [12]. 
  Several studies have assessed Salmonella prevalence on 
farms. García-Feliz reported a Salmonella prevalence of 
43.1%  in  finishing  pig  herds  in  Spain  [9].  In  contrast, 
Visscher  reported  a  Salmonella  prevalence  of  5.58%  in 
fattening pigs in Lower Saxony, Germany [28]. However, 
Salmonella  spp.  data  is  insufficient  for  quantitative 
measurement and development of strategies to reduce the 
risk of this pathogen.
  Pig farmers routinely use antibiotics for both treatment 
and prophylactic purposes. Excessive and incorrect uses of 
antibiotics  are  probably  a  primary  cause  of  increasing 
bacterial resistance [23,27]. In addition, further study of

develop antibiotic resistance profiles of pigs for porcine 
and human cases.
  Pathogen characterization is essential for investigation of 
foodborne bacteria epidemiology. Serotyping is one of the

most 
characterization.  However,  this  technique  has  a  lower 
discriminatory power than molecular techniques such as 
pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). PFGE has long 
been accepted as a molecular characterization method for a 
wide range of bacterial species, including Salmonella. This 
technique  clearly  and  precisely  distinguishes  bacterial 
genotypic  diversity  and

epidemiological  investigations  of  foodborne  pathogens, 
such as Salmonella spp. [8].
  The  objectives  of  this  study  were  to  determine  the 
prevalence and quantitative loads of Salmonella spp. at the 
farm  level  in  Chiang  Mai  -  Lamphun  to  assess  loading 
levels before going to the slaughterhouse and define the 
diversity of Salmonella spp. by phenotypic and serotypic 
characterizations. In addition, the pulse-field types were 
assessed  to  determine  dynamic  propagation,  including 
origin,  evaluation  and  common  source  of  infection  or 
transmission patterns of Salmonella spp. in the study area.

Materials and Methods

Sample collection

  The present study was performed on six farms (A∼F) in 
Chiang Mai - Lamphun (Thailand). A total of 606 fecal 
samples were randomly collected from the rectum of pigs 
by the individual finger palpation method. Fecal samples 
from pigs aged 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 weeks, sows and boars 
were  collected  for  further  microbiological  assay  for 
detection  and  quantification  purposes.  In  addition,  199 
environmental  samples  were  collected,  including  swabs 
from the floor of the animal house, feeder, nipple-drinker, 
and worker’s hands and boots (100 cm2/samples). Samples 
were also collected from the drinking water, feed and pests 
(such as flies). All samples were shipped in an icebox to the 
Central  Laboratory,  Chiang  Mai  University, 
for 
Salmonella isolation within 24 h of collection.

Salmonella  isolation  (qualitative  and  quantitative 
assays)
  Isolation  and  identification  of  Salmonella  spp.  was 
conducted  following  the  ISO  6579:2002  Amendment 
1:2007, Annex D technique (Detection of Salmonella spp. 
in  animal  feces  and  environmental  samples  from  the 
primary production stage) to determine the prevalence and 
numbers of positive samples [13].
  For the qualitative assay, solid samples of fresh feces, 
feed and flies were obtained. Next, nine times the amount 
of buffered peptone water (BPW; Merck, Germany) was 

times 

into  nine 

added as pre-enrichment media (25 g of solid sample was 
added  to  225  mL  of  BPW).  The  mixture  was  then 
homogenized  using  a  stomacher  machine  for  2  min. 
Following incubation at 37oC for 24 h, an aliquot of 0.1 mL 
was  transferred  to  a  Modified  Semi-solid  Rappaport- 
Vassiliadis (MSRV; Oxiod, UK). The samples were then 
incubated at 42oC for 24 h, after which the material from 
this  agar  was  streaked  onto  xylose  lysine  deoxycholate 
agar (XLD; Oxiod) and brilliant-green phenol red lactose 
sucrose agar (BPLS; Merck) and incubated at 37oC for 24 
h.  The  presumptive  Salmonella  colonies  were  further 
processed for biochemical tests, including measurement of 
triple sugar iron (TSI; Oxiod), urease and motile indole 
lysine decarboxylase (MIL; Merck).
  Environmental samples such as drinking-water were also 
added 
the  quantity  of  BPW  as 
pre-enrichment  media  and  incubated  at  37oC  for  24  h. 
Next, aliquots of 0.1 mL and 1 mL were transferred to 9.9 
mL of Rappaport-Vassiliadis broth (RV; Merck) and 9 mL 
of  tetrathionate  broth  (TT;  Merck),  respectively.  After 
incubation at 42°C for 24 h for RV and 37oC for 24 h for TT, 
material taken from each broth was streaked onto selective 
solid media (XLD and BPLS agar), and a biochemical test 
for presumptive colonies was conducted. 
  Environmental swab samples were subjected to the same 
procedure  used  for  drinking-water  samples,  except  that 
these samples were prepared with 100 mL of BPW, rather 
than nine times the weight, in the pre-enrichment process. 
  In the quantitative assays, the number of Salmonella was 
determined  using  the  most  probable  number  (MPN) 
technique.  From  each  positive  sample,  which  was  kept 
refrigerated, three replicates in three portions (3 × 0.1 mL, 
3 × 0.01 mL and 3 × 0.001 mL) were taken aseptically and 
added individually to tubes with BPW. All processes of 
Salmonella  identification  were  performed  as  qualitative 
tests, and all suspected colonies from selective media were 
continually confirmed as Salmonella by biochemical tests. 
Salmonella-positive  results  were  used 
to  estimate 
Salmonella quantification with the MPN calculator [17]. 

Serotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility testing
  A total of 200 Salmonella-positive isolates were randomly 
serotyped as appropriate by the WHO National Salmonella 
and  Shigella  Center  Laboratory  (NSSC),  Nonthaburi, 
Thailand.  In  addition,  each  serotype  was  submitted  to 
antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Susceptibility to a panel 
of ten antimicrobial agents was investigated and interpreted 
by  disk  diffusion  [4].  If  isolates  showed  intermediate 
resistance  [4],  they  were  grouped  with  the  susceptible 
isolates  to  avoid  overestimation  of  resistance.  The 
antibiotics were abbreviated as follows: ampicillin (AMP); 
amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AUG); chloramphenicol (C); 
ciprofloxacin  (CIP);  cefotaxime  (CTX);  nalidixic  acid 
(NA);  norfloxacin  (NOR);  streptomycin  (S);  tetracycline 

(TE); sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SXT) (Oxoid).   

PFGE genotyping
  DNA fingerprinting of the first major serotype isolated in 
this  study  was  conducted  using  PFGE  at  the  Infectious 
Diseases Molecular Epidemiology Laboratory (IDMEL) 
of  Ohio  State  University.  Twenty-five  isolates  were 
selected at random and subjected to PFGE according to the 
CDC’s  standardized  PulseNet  protocol  for  Salmonella 
[19]. The PulseNet “Universal” standard strain Salmonella 
enterica  serovar  Braenderup  H9812  was  used  as  a 
reference  marker,  and  XbaI  was  used  as  a  digestion 
enzyme.  Gel  images  were  transferred  to  Bionumerics 
software ver. 3.5 for cluster analysis. Cluster analysis was 
performed using the unweighted pair group method, with 
optimization with 1.0% band position tolerances and 2.5% 
optimization values. Similarity coefficients were obtained 
within  Bionumerics  by  calculating  Dice  coefficients. 
PFGE  banding  patterns  with  a  similarity  index ＞75% 
were grouped within the same genotypic cluster. 

Statistical analyses 
  The  data  were  collected  and  analyzed  for  descriptive 
statistical analysis of Salmonella in both prevalence and 
numbers by Microsoft Excel and PHstat2. A Chi-square 
test and ANOVA were used to compare the proportion of 
the  presence  of  Salmonella  and  the  mean  of  the  MPN

StataSE9.0 (StataCorp, USA).

Results

  The overall prevalence of Salmonella spp. in pig farms in 
Chiang Mai - Lamphun was 30.56% (246/805). For the 
fecal samples, 34.98% (212/606) of the positives samples 
were  included.  These  were  classified  into  seven  groups 
included in this study. According to the Chi-square test, the 
greatest prevalence was in finishing pigs aged 12 weeks 
(57.73%,  95%  CI:  47.90∼67.56).  The  prevalence  of 
Salmonella-positive  samples  in  the  environment  was 
17.08% (34/199), which was lower than that of the fecal 
samples.  No  positive  results  were  observed  in  the  feed 
samples,  and  the  prevalence  of  Salmonella  in  the 
environmental  samples  was  not  significantly  different 
among the six farms (p ＞ 0.05).
  We were unable to re-isolate Salmonella spp. from 87 
samples (74 fecal samples and 13 environmental samples) 
during  the  quantification  assays.  Consequently,  some 
sample  types  could  not  be  quantified,  including  the 
drinking-water,  worker’s  hands  and  fly  samples.  In  the 
remaining 159 positive samples, the number of Salmonella 
ranged  from  1.48∼4.04  Log10MPN/g,  with  a  mean  ± 
standard deviation (SD) of 2.11 ± 0.57 (data not shown). In 
addition,  there  was  no  significant  difference  between

  Table 2 shows the serodiversity of 200 randomly selected 
Salmonella strains. Up to 20 serotypes were found in this 
study.  The  highest  frequency  isolate  was  Salmonella 
Rissen  (28%),  followed  by  Salmonella  Typhimurium 
(15.5%) and Salmonella I. 4,5,12 : i : - (13.5%). Salmonella 
I.  4,12  :  i  :  -,  Salmonella  IV.  ser  43:z4z23,  Salmonella 
Agona,  Salmonella  Krefeld  and  Salmonella  Mbandaka 
were  present  at  the  lowest  frequencies  (0.5%  each).  In 
addition, 9 of 20 serotypes were found in both the fecal and 
environmental samples. However, 9 and 2 serotypes were 
unique 
to 
fecal  and  environmental  samples, 
respectively.
  Fig.  1  shows  the  percentage  of  antimicrobial  resistant 
Salmonella strains (n = 200). Most isolates were resistant 
to  ampicillin  (AMP)  (81.5%),  followed  by  tetracycline 
(TE) 
and 
sulfa-trimethoprim (SXT) (35.5%). However, none of the 
isolates  showed  resistance 
to  norfloxacin  (NOR), 
ciprofloxacin (CIP) or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AUG).

(53 samples in 15 resistance-patterns). Only two patterns 
were observed in only one isolate from each environmental 
sample.  The  highest  frequency  antimicrobial  resistance 
pattern  among  the  tested  isolates  in  this  study  was 
AMP/S/TE (ampicillin/streptomycin/tetracycline).
  Salmonella Rissen, the most common type observed in 
this  study,  was  randomly  selected  (n  =  25)  from  fecal 
samples for pulse-field gel electrophoresis characterization. 
The  PFGE  XbaI  macrorestriction  banding  patterns 
consisted of 10∼12 DNA fragment bands. PFGE generated 
two major genotypic clusters (X-Y) with a dice coefficient 
index cut-off point of 75% (Fig. 2). The similarity among 
cluster  X  was  about  75∼100%,  and  represented  the 

predominant  group  in  this  study,  which  comprised  18 
isolates (from farms A, B and D in 8, 2, and 8 isolates, 
respectively). The Salmonella Rissen isolated from farm A 
and B showed identical DNA fingerprint profiles clustered 
in only one genotypic group (cluster X). Cluster Y contained 
two indistinguishable isolates from farm C. Interestingly, 
among samples from farm D, all isolates (8/8) from cluster 
X and all isolates from cluster Y (5/5) belonged to different 
pig type samples, suggesting a different source of infection 
among  starters  and  sows  in  farm  D.  Finally,  the 
antimicrobial resistance patterns of isolates from the same 
farm were partially different, except for six isolates from 
farm  A  and  two  isolates  from  farm  C,  which  showed  a

  The overall prevalence of Salmonella spp. was 30.56%, 
comprised of 34.98% from fecal samples and 17.08% from 
environmental samples. The prevalence of Salmonella in 
the  fecal  samples  was  similar  to  the  43.1%  prevalence 
reported in finishing pigs from a study of fattening units in 
Spain [9], with comparable isolation technique. However, 
our  study  revealed  substantially  lower  prevalence  than 
other  studies  in  Northern  Thailand,  which  recorded 
prevalence in pre-slaughter pigs of 55% [20] and 63% [6]. 
These differences might be due to the timing of sampling 
(“on farm” in our study and pre-slaughter in their study), 
with the stress during transportation and lairage potentially 
increasing the shedding of Salmonella from the intestinal 
lumen  [15,26].  In  contrast,  a  study  of  finishing  pigs 
conducted in Germany revealed lower prevalence (5.65%) 
than our study [28]. Fecal swabs from the rectum may not 

be sufficient to compare with the amount of feces (up to 25 
g) collected in our study, and good management practices 
in Germany may reduce pathogen levels on farms.
  Upon  comparison  of  sample  types,  prevalence  from 
environmental  samples  was  generally  lower  than  fecal 
samples, except for flies and worker’s boot samples. Flies 
are a major vehicle for foodborne pathogens, and boots of 
workers easily come into contact with animal feces; thus, 
their  prevalence  may  be  higher  than  that  of  other 
environmental samples.
  In this study, Salmonella spp. could not be recovered from 
87 
samples  using  quantitative  assays,  although 
corresponding portions of the same samples were positive 
in the qualitative assays. The heterogeneous distribution 
and the overall low number of Salmonella in the samples 
may have been due to a failure of re-isolation procedures 
[16].  The  MPN  range  of  the  remaining  Salmonella- 
positive samples was quite low (1.48∼4.04 Log10MPN/g 
for the fecal samples and 1.56∼3.38 Log10MPN/g for the 
environmental  samples).  However,  under 
the  right 
conditions, even 1 CFU can grow to several million [25]. 
Therefore, relatively low levels of Salmonella at any point 
in the production process can have a large impact if they 
have the opportunity to proliferate to hazardous numbers 
under  improper  conditions  [21].  Some  such  conditions 
may include longer waiting times in lairage, contributing 
to increased shedding of the pathogen from the intestinal 
lumen [15,23], inadequate processing of the carcasses in 
the  slaughterhouse,  such  as  evisceration,  resulting  in 
carcass contamination [3,15,26], and temperature abuse in 
retail  shops,  leading  to  increasing  contamination  levels 
[2,5,7,11,15]. 
  This  study  demonstrated  that  two  major  serotypes, 
Salmonella Rissen and Salmonella Typhimurium, were the 
most common observed during pig production in Chiang 
Mai  -  Lamphun,  Thailand.  These  serotypes  have  been 
reported  as  the  dominant  serotype  in  pigs  in  the  same 
region [6,18], and Salmonella Rissen was also the most 
common Salmonella serotype found in healthy humans in 
Upper  Northern  Thailand  [18].  The  serodiversity  of 
Salmonella-positive  samples 
the 
environment  were  quite  similar,  suggesting  that  the 
environment is a potential source of Salmonella infection 
in  pigs  [28].  The  post-infected  animal  could  be  highly 
susceptible 
the 
environment [6]. Interestingly, Salmonella Typhimurium 
was  only  found  in  fecal  samples,  which  differs  from 
several  studies  in  which  Salmonella  Typhimurium  was 
also present in the environment [6,21,28]. Organisms in 
these samples may have been destroyed by exposure to 
sunlight  or  disinfectants,  or  there  may  have  been  no 
common source of infection with this serotype between 
pigs and the environment. In this study, some serotypes 
were found only in environmental samples, suggesting that

other  sources  not  sampled  in  this  study  played  roles  as 
important  shedders,  such  as  wild  birds,  lizards  or 
invertebrates.
  We  also  demonstrated  the  widespread  occurrence  of 
antimicrobial resistance. Specifically, resistance (21.5% to 
81.5%) 
streptomycin, 
sulfa-trimethoprim  and  chloramphenicol  was  observed, 
which is concordant with the results of previous studies of 
Salmonella  epidemiology  in  pigs,  pork  and  humans  in 
Belgium and Thailand [22,27]. Antimicrobial drugs from 
the same groups as ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline 
and  sulfa-trimethoprim  have  been  widely  used  on  pig 
farms in Thailand. Sub-dosing or extra-label usage could 
explain the high rates of resistance [23,24,27]. In contrast, 
chloramphenicol  was  banned  from  animal  production 
more  than  10  years  ago;  however,  resistance  to  this 
antibiotic  could  be  due  to  horizontal  gene  transmission 
[27]. The observed absence of resistance to norfloxacin, 
ciprofloxacin  and  amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid  may  have 
been due to the limited use of these antimicrobial drugs in 
pig  production  in  Thailand.  The  highest  frequency 
resistance was reported in AMP/S/TE, and in both sample 
types (pigs and environment). This finding suggests that 
there  is  horizontal  transmission  of  the  antimicrobial 
resistance-gene between Salmonella strains from feces to 
the environment.
  PFGE  profiling  was  used  to  identify  similarities  of 
Salmonella in the Salmonella Rissen isolates. The results 
also  indicated  the  occurrence  of  cross  contamination 
among pig farms. There were 12 isolates with identical 
PFGE  patterns  (similarity  indexes  of  ≥95)  from  two 
different  farms  (A  &  D)  classified  in  the  same  group 
(cluster  X).  This  finding  demonstrated  that  sources  of 
Salmonellosis may spread over a wide area via the same 
supply  chain  (e.g.,  gilt,  feed  or  feed-ingredients)  or  a 
common  source  of  infection  among  farms  (e.g.,  a 
transportation truck). In addition, all isolates from farm D 
were separated into two distinguishable genotypic groups 
among starters and sows, indicating no common source of 
infection between the two age groups. This may indicate 
that there is no common source of infection between the 
fattening  and  farrowing  units,  which  are 
located 
approximately  10  km  apart.  However,  in  this  study, 
infection in pigs resulting from environmental exposure 
could  not  be  determined  precisely.  Thus,  further 
investigation  might  be  needed  to  assess  the  genotypic 
profiles of the positive environmental samples. When we 
compared the PFGE results and antimicrobial resistance 
patterns, the same antimicrobial resistance patterns with 
the same farm origin were observed, contrary to a previous 
study by Pulsrikarn et al. [22], who demonstrated that there 
was  no  association  between  PFGE  and  antimicrobial 
resistance patterns. This finding suggests that horizontal 
resistance  gene  transmission  may  be  occurring  among

these farms. 
  Salmonella on farms is the first-origin of Salmonellosis in 
human cases, and is unlikely to be alleviated effectively in 
the short term. Farm control programs must be based on 
strict biosecurity and hygiene measures to minimize the 
risk of Salmonella exposure to many potential infection 
sources. Moreover, these findings highlight the need for 
continuous  monitoring,  along  with  greater  focus  on 
problem solving at the farm level, which can reduce the 
contamination  pressure  downstream  at  slaughterhouses 
and retail shops.
