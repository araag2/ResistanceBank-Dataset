ABSTRACT.  Salmonella  and  Campylobacter  are  common  bacterial  pathogens  associated  with  human  gastro-enteritis;  and  raw  poultry  is
considered to be an important source of these bacteria.  To evaluate whether the Salmonella serovars and Campylobacter spp. bacteria
could be monitored for the purpose of microbial presence, enumeration and antimicrobial resistance in raw poultry, 152 poultry carcasses
were randomly selected from 10 markets in retail outlets of Phnom Penh during March 2006 to February 2007.  The majority of poultry
samples was contaminated by Salmonella serovars (88.2%) and Campylobacter spp. (80.9%).  A very high contamination of Salmonella
was found at 3–4 log10 CFU/g for 22.4% of samples and of Campylobacter at 7–8 log10 CFU/g for 1.3% of samples.  Fifty nine different
Salmonella serovars contaminated 134 poultry carcasses; five most prevalent serovars covered 29.1% of serovars isolates (Anatum, Typh-
imurium, Corvallis, Stanley and Enteritidis).  Three Campylobacter species contaminating 123 raw poultry were Campylobacter jejuni
(50.0%), Campylobacter coli (29.0%) and Campylobacter lari (21.0%).  High antibiotic resistance percentages were found among Sal-
monella serovars and Campylobacter spp. isolates.  This study revealed that raw poultry at the retail outlets in Phnom Penh markets are
contaminated  with  high  prevalences  of  food-borne  pathogens, and  communicating  the  importance  of minimizing this  risk  in  reducing
human infections.
KEY WORDS: antimicrobial susceptibility, Campylobacter, poultry, prevalence, Salmonella.

Salmonella and Campylobacter are both the most impor-
tant food-borne diseases and cause substantial medical and
economic burdens worldwide.  In developing countries,
investigations have shown that infection caused by Campy-
lobacter spp. may be as serious as those by Salmonella sero-
vars, both in frequency and severity symptoms [3].  Poultry
is one of the principal reservoirs of non typhoid human Sal-
monella infection and causes potential of food-poisoning
hazards [5, 14].  Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter
coli infecting also poultry carcasses are major causes of gas-
troenteritidis in human [7, 17].  To prevent poultry carcass
contaminations, it is crucial to control Salmonella serovars
and Campylobacter spp. infections along the food produc-
tion chain.  But in spite of improved hygiene at the farm and
slaughterhouse levels, numerous poultry carcasses remain
infected in retail outlets [3].  Because of this, a number of
actions have been taken to reduce the prevalence of Salmo-
nella and Campylobacter with public health significance in
food-producing animals.  Quantitative microbiology risk
assessment is still hampered by the lack of quantitative data.
The generation of appropriate data with high sensitivity is a
challenge for microbiologists since currently used bacterio-
logical quantitation methodologies are laborious.  Further-
more, quantitative Salmonella data for food associated with
severe outbreaks have shown that the type of food plays a
major role in the severity of illness.  Salmonella in fatty food
may have an advantage during passage through the acidic
environment of the stomach to the intestine, where the cells

become invasive regardless the damage caused by the acids.
In Cambodia, very little is known regarding the occur-
rence of food borne disease caused by enteric bacteria.  For
this, the authors processed to evaluate prevalence’s, num-
bers and antimicrobial susceptibilities of Salmonella sero-
vars and Campylobacter spp. in retail outlets of Phnom Penh
markets during one year period.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Samples: Between March 2006 to February 2007, 152
poultry carcasses were collected from retail outlets of 10
markets in Phnom Penh city of Cambodia.  Poultry were
slaughtered directly in these markets sites.  Every week,
three samples were selected from each fixed retail outlet
within three different markets, and another week, three other
markets will be interested.  The random was processed like
this along 10 markets during one year period.  Neck skin of
poultry carcasses were selected, because the small hair of
poultry neck skin retained micro-organisms.

Isolation and identification of Salmonella: Culture and
isolation  of  Salmonella  was  conducted  using  standard
method ISO 6579 as previously described [11].  Transparent
well-isolated colonies with black center typical Salmonella
morphology were collected from selective media and identi-
fied by using biochemical reactions.  Isolates with typical
Salmonella were confirmed to be Salmonella serovars based
on detection of somatic and flagella antigens.

Enumeration  of  Salmonella:  A  semi-quantitative
approach using modified semisolid Rappaport Vassiliadis
(MSRV) agar was applied [18] by practice successive dilu-
tions and by aspired 0.5 ml of aliquot (1/10) from the 1st

serial to 4th serial of wells.  After incubation the microplates
at 37°C for 20 hr, 20 µl of each dilution was peripheral
transferred to the 2nd microplate to corresponding wells fill-
ing with 2 ml of MSRV media.  The 2nd microplate was
incubated at 41.5°C for 24–48 hr.  Wells of agar semisolid-
MSRV presenting a range of migration with a discoloration
were presumed to be positive.  The positive or doubtful
wells were cultured onto Hektoen (Difco) agar plate at 37°C
for 20 hr, for a confirmation of positive Salmonella as
above.  For the Salmonella enumeration, the positive and
negative result for each sample should be seized in the mask
of MNP calculator, the weight of each sample and serials of
dilution rates included in the test from 1st to 4th well were
noted as 0.2 g at 1/10, 0.04 g at 1/5, 0.008 g at 1/25 and
0.0016 g at 1/125, a number 1 was noted for a positive well
and a number 0 for a negative well.

Isolation and identification of Campylobacter: Culture of
Campylobacter was conducted using standard method ISO
10272–1 as previously described [15] and characteristic col-
onies (grayish on Karmali and grey on CCDA) were sus-
pended in Brucella broth; Campylobacter bacterium was
identified as curved bacterium with Gram (–) coloration and
a spin movement under the microscope.  Biochemical iden-
tifications were done on TSI agar (Difco) slant tubes, oxy-
dase test, catalase test, sensibility to nalidixic acid and
cefalotin disks, hydrolysis of hippurate and growth test at
25°C in Brucella broth.  The sensitivity to nalidixic acid dif-
ferentiated C.lari from C. jejuni and C. lari.

Enumeration of Campylobacter: The method ISO/CD
10272–2 was used to enumerate Campylobacter as previ-
ously described [10] and a loopful of suspect positive ali-
quot  was  cultured  on  Colombia  plates  (Oxoid)  in
microaerophilic atmosphere at 42°C during 24 hr.  Bio-
chemical identifications of Campylobacter spp. were done
identically as above.

Antimicrobial susceptibility test: All Salmonella and
Campylobacter isolates were tested for antimicrobial sus-
ceptibilities by the disk diffusion method [16].  The follow-
ing antimicrobials were tested at the indicated concentration
(in µg/disk except where specified) for Salmonella isolates:
amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ticarcillin, cefalo-

tin,  cefoxitin,  cefotaxim,  gentamicin,  streptomycin,
chloramphenicol, sulfonamide,  cotrimoxazol,  nalixidic
acid, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline.  For Campylobacter
isolates, the disks tested were amoxicillin, cefalotin, gen-
tamicin, erythromycin, azithromycin, nalidixic acid and
ciprofloxacin.

The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the
antimicrobial agents against isolates and the breakpoints
were determined by NCCLS criteria and read by Osiris sys-
tem (Biorad).

Statistical analysis: The prevalence of Salmonella and
Campylobacter was calculated by using Microsoft Excel.
The general formula for Salmonella count (MNP method)
and Campylobacter spp. colonies count using for plates con-
tained between 15 to 150 colonies were applied.

RESULTS

Salmonella were isolated from 134 (88.2%) out of 152
samples processed with 201 isolates, whereas Campylo-
bacter were isolated from 123 (80.9%) samples including
139 isolates.

Different quantitative contaminations of Salmonella were
displayed by 34 samples (22.4%) at 3–4 log10CFU/g, 56
samples (36.8%) at 2–3 log10CFU/g, 32 samples (21.1%) at
1–2 log10CFU/g, and 12 samples (7.9%) at 0–1 log10CFU/g
(Fig. 1).

Among 134 positive samples, seven samples harbored
four different species of Salmonella (5%), 12 samples of 3
different species (9%), 49 samples of 2 different species
(37%) and 66 samples of one specie (49%).

Fifty nine Salmonella serovars from positive samples are
listed in the Table 1.  The most prevalent serotypes are Sal-
monella Anatum, Salmonella Typhimurium, Salmonella
Corvallis, Salmonella Stanley and Salmonella Enteritidis
that covered 29.1% of all isolated serovars.

The contamination of raw poultry by Campylobacter spp.
was found successively from high to low quantitative rates:
2 samples (1.3%) at 7–8 log10CFU/g, 6 samples (3.9%) at 6–
7 log10CFU/g, 33 samples (21.7%) at 5–6 log10CFU/g, 50
samples (32.9%) at 4–5 log10 CFU/g, 25 samples (16.4%) at

One hundred thirty nine isolates of Campylobacter recov-
ered from three species contaminated poultry carcasses;
Campylobacter jejuni was more frequently isolated (50.0%)
than Campylobacter coli (29.0%) or Campylobacter lari
(21.0%).

Table 2 shows the results of antimicrobial susceptibility
tests for Salmonella serovars circulating among raw poultry
in Phnom Penh markets.  All Salmonella isolates were sen-

sitive to cefotaxim and cefoxitin.  About 23.1–53.8% of Sal-
monella  Anatum  presented  high  resistant  rates  to  six
antimicrobials (amoxicillin, cefalotin, cotrimoxazol, nalid-
ixic acid, sulfonamid and tetracycline).  In other hand Sal-
monella Typhimurium were resistant to four antimicrobials
from 15.4–23.1% (amoxicillin, nalidixic acid, sulfonamid
and tetracycline).  Salmonella Corvallis presented high pro-
portions of resistance to nalidixic acid, sulfonamid and tet-
racycline (respectively 42.0, 75.0 and 75.0%).  Salmonella
Stanley displayed a resistance only to tetracycline (90.0%).
The resistance of Salmonella Enteritidis was important and
varied from 10.0–90.0% to amoxicillin, ticarcillin, nalidixic
acid, streptomycin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline.

The antimicrobial resistance was apparent for Campylo-
bacter jejuni (97.1%), Campylobacter coli (97.5%) and
Campylobacter lari (96.7%) displaying to cefalotin.  About
90.0%, 69.6% and 15.0% of Campylobacter lari, Campylo-
bacter jejuni and, Campylobacter coli were resistant to nali-
dixic  acid.    Three  antimicrobial  agents  (amoxicillin,
azithromycin and erythromycin) were completely inhibiting
by Campylobacter coli.  Otherwise, Campylobacter jejuni
was sensitive to gentamicin (Table 3).

DISCUSSION

The present study conducted over 1 year period shows
high prevalences and numbers of 2 major enteric bacteria
contaminating raw poultry in retail outlets among 10 Phnom
Penh city markets.  These bacteria resulted from a cross con-
tamination of the kitchen environment bacteria and direct
hand-to-mouth exposure of enteric pathogens [6].  The prev-
alence (88.2%) of Salmonella serovars in Cambodia from
poultry carcasses was at the same level as the prevalence of
Salmonella in other developing countries, 72.0% in Thai-
land from retail chicken meat samples and 80.0% of poultry
in open markets [1], although only 4.6% of farming ducks in

antimicrobials tested were completely inhibiting by Salmo-
nella Stanley.  The same level of resistance of Salmonella
Typhimurium to nalidixic acid (23%) was observed in a
study performing in France [2].  Our results on the resis-
tance of Salmonella Enteritidis to nalidixic acid were higher
than what was seen in Europe in raw poultry (15.0%) [2].

Results of this study show important information regard-
ing the contamination of Salmonella and Campylobacter
spp in poultry among Phnom Penh markets, and the dissem-
ination of resistance of these bacteria to major antibiotics
confirming the crucial role of raw animal as the source of
resistance to antimicrobial spread.  Thus, it is important to
increase the awareness of veterinary authorities to promote
the hygiene practices at the slaughter of poultry within Cam-
bodian markets.  It is also recommended to monitor the
poultry farming as a preventive measure to avoid the micro-
organism development in the initial chain of poultry con-
sumption.

Taiwan were positive for Salmonella [20].  In developed
countries, the level of Salmonella contamination of raw
chicken was 30.8% in poultry layer feces in North Carolina
(U.S.A.) [12], a mean of prevalence was 22.4% in reproduc-
tive laying hens in Poland, over a 5 year period (2001–2005)
[19] and 13.4% of laying hens were positive in the Nether-
lands [21].

The numbers of Salmonella in our study varied from less
than 1 to 4 log10 CFU/g for 134 samples.  Nevertheless, no
spoilage was observed in the poultry meat before processing
and it was thought that competition among the micro-organ-
isms in the poultry meat might suppress the growth of Sal-
monella cells [8].  A previous study showed that inoculated
105 CFU/g of Salmonella cells in minced meat, they grew to
a high population level (109 CFU/g) [13].  Another study in
U.S.A. showed also same range of Salmonella number
which varied from <1.00 to 3.76 log 10 CFU/g in layer feces
hens [12].

A high prevalence of Campylobacter spp. was calculated
in the study (80.9%).  In Thailand a high prevalence rate of
Campylobacter jejuni  was  also observed  from broilers
flocks that correlated with the results of our study (65.0%)
[4].    In  the  Netherlands  a  previous  study  showed  that
Campylobacter spp. were positive for 27.1% of chicken
broilers [21].  Our results showed high quantitative numbers
of Campylobacter spp. in Cambodian markets that varied
from <1–8 log10CFU/g in poultry carcasses.  In Europe
Campylobacter spp. were found in moderate rates, from less
than 1–4.5 log10CFU/g in Belgium chicken meat [9] and in
Italian  broilers,  the mean  rates  varied  from  3.93–6.13
log 10CFU/g [14].

High multiple antimicrobial resistance profiles were
observed for Salmonella Anatum, Salmonella Typhimu-
rium, Salmonella Corvallis, Salmonella Enteritidis and
other Salmonella serovars to amoxicillin (8.3–90.0%), nali-
dixic acid (16.9–80.0%), sulfonamide (8.5–75.0%) and tet-
racycline (15.4–90.0%).  Only  Salmonella Stanley was
