Abstract

foods.  Shiga 

Lack of proper hygiene and using from
low quality raw materials cause high pres-
ence  of  food-borne  pathogens  in  ready  to
eat 
toxin  producing
Escherichia coli is one of the most common
cause of food-borne diseases in the world.
The present research was done to study the
prevalence  and  distribution  of  virulence
factors  in  the  STEC  strains  isolated  from
various types of ready to eat food samples.
Seven-hundred  and  twenty  food  samples
were collected and cultured. Isolated E. coli
bacteria were approved another time using
the  16S  rRNA-based PCR  amplification.
Approved  strains  were  subjected  to  multi-
plex PCR for identification of putative viru-
lence  factors.  Twenty-six  out  of  720  food
samples (5.20%) were positive for E. coli.
Salad (15%), candy (12.50%) and barbecue
(10%)  were  the  most  commonly  contami-
nated.  Prevalence  of  STEC  strains  was
2.63%.  Prevalence  of  EHEC  and  AEEC
subtypes were 36.84% and 52.63%, respec-
tively. EHEC strains harbored all three stx1,
eae and ehly genes. High presence of EHEC
strains besides the considerable distribution
of  multiple  virulence  factors  showed  an
important public health issue regarding the
consumption of ready to eat foods.

Introduction

Food  hygiene  in  restaurants  and  fast-
foods are one of the most important critical
issue. Using from low quality raw materi-
als,  cooking  of  foods  more  than  daily
requirement and their storage in unsuitable
conditions  and  finally  lack  of  the  proper
hygiene  are  the  main  factors  causing
enhancement of the microbial spoilage and
growth of dangerous food-borne pathogens

bacterium  of 

in  foods.1 Among  all  pathogenic  agents
causing  food-borne  diseases,  Escherichia
coli (E. coli) strains had a significant posi-
tion.2-8 E. coli is a Gram-negative, non-spo-
rulating, flagellated, rod-shaped and facul-
tative 
the
Enterobacteriaceae family.  Shiga  (vero)
toxin  (Stx)-producing  E.  coli  (STEC)  is  a
subdivision  of  a  significant  pathogenic
group of this bacterium named enterohem-
orrhagic  E.  coli  (EHEC).2-8 In  the  other
hand,  STEC  strains  are  divided  into  two
separate 
and
Attaching and  Effacing  E.  coli (AEEC).
EHEC strains are responsible for high mor-
bidity  and  mortality.  AEEC  strains  are
described by their ability to occur attaching-
and-effacing (A/E) lesions in the gastroin-
testinal  tract  of  humans  and  animals.2-8
STEC  bacteria  are  responsible  for  severe
clinical  syndromes 
like  Hemorrhagic
Colitis (HC), Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome
(HUS), bloody and non-bloody diarrhea and
Thrombotic  Thrombocytopenic  Purpura
(TTP).2-8

of  EHEC 

Presence  of  latent  virulence  factors
including  Shiga  toxins  (stx1 and  stx2),
intimin (eaeA) and hemolysin (hlyA) in the
STEC strains of food products make them
dangerous  pathogens  for  human  health.
These  genes  are  responsible  for  bacterial
adhesion, colonization and invasion into the
gastric epithelial cells.2-8

According  to  the  uncertain  role  of
STEC strains in ready to eat foods and lack
of  epidemiological  and  microbiological
investigations in this field in Iran, the pres-
ent  research  was  done  to  study  the  preva-
lence and distribution of virulence factors in
the  STEC  strains  isolated  from  various
types of ready to eat food samples.

(n=60), traditional ice-cream (n=60), barbe-
cue (n=70), soup (n=75) and spices (n=70)
were  randomly  collected  from  various
restaurants  in  the  Isfahan  province,  Iran.
Samples  were  immediately  transferred  to
laboratory in cooler with ice-packs. 

Totally,  10-g  of  crushed  food  samples
were homogenized for 2 min in 90 mL of
Peptone  Water  (PW,  Merck,  Germany).
Then  the  samples  were  cultured  on  5%
sheep blood and MacConkey agar (Merck,
Germany) and incubated for 18 to 24 h at
37°C.  Colonies  with  the  typical  color  and
appearance  of  E.  coli  were  picked  and
streaked again on blood agar plates and re-
streaked on EMB agar (Merck, Germany).
All plates were further incubated for 24 h at
37°C.  The  green  metallic  colonies  were
considered  as  E.  coli.  The  presumptive
colonies  were  biochemically  tested  for
growth on triple sugar iron agar (TSI) and

ships. The prevalence of virulence factors in
the  E.  coli strains  isolated  from  various
types of ready to eat food samples were sta-
tistically  analyzed.  Statistical  significance
was regarded at a P value <0.05.

Results

Table  2  indicates  the  prevalence  of  E.
coli in  various  types  of  ready  to  eat  food
samples.  Twenty-six  out  of  720  (5.20%)
food  samples  were  positive  for  E.  coli.
There were no positive results for sausage,

salami,  roast  mouthful  and  soup  samples.
Salad (15%), candy (12.50%) and barbecue
(10%) had the highest prevalence of E. coli.
Statistically  significant  differences  were
seen  between  the  types  of  samples  and
prevalence of E. coli (P<0.05). 

Figures 1 and 2 represent the results of
the  gel  electrophoresis  for  stx1,  eaeA and
also stx2 and ehly virulence factors, respec-
tively. Table 3 represents the distribution of
virulence factors in the E. coli strains isolat-
ed from various types of ready to eat food
samples. We found that 19 out of 26 E. coli
strains (73.07%) had Shiga toxigenic viru-
lence factors and were determined as STEC

various types of food samples were 2.63%.
Results  showed  that  the  prevalence  of
EHEC  and  AEEC  subtypes  in  the  E.  coli
strains  of  ready  to  eat  food  samples  were
36.84%  and  52.63%,  respectively.  EHEC
strains harbored all three stx1, eae and ehly
genes.  Statistically  significant  difference
was seen between the prevalence of EHEC
and AEEC subtypes (P<0.05). 

Discussion

The present research showed that viru-
lent  STEC  strains  had  a  significant  preva-
lence in various types of ready to eat food
samples  and  especially  Salad,  candy  and
barbecue. We found that the prevalence of
E. coli strains and also STEC strains in var-
ious types of ready to eat foods were 5.20%
and  2.63%,  respectively.  Using  from  low
quality  and  contaminated  raw  materials,
application  of  contaminated  dishes  and
equipment  used  for  food  preparation  and
finally lack of adequate time and tempera-
ture for well cooking of foods are the most
important reasons for the high prevalence of

E.  coli and  STEC  strains  in  our  study.
However,  the  role  of  infected  staffs  as  a
sources  of  STEC  strains  could  not  be
ignore. 

The main source of human EHEC and
AEEC  contaminations  are  contaminated

and  undercooked  ready  to  eat  foods  and
especially foods with animal origin like raw
and under-cooked meat.9-12 All of the ready
to  eat  food  samples  of  our  investigation
were meat-based ready to eat foods. Some
of them like sausage, salami and soup were

produced in high temperature and therefore
were  free  from  any  pathogenic  bacteria.
Barbecue is a meat-based Kebab produced
by  roasting  of  beef  on  the  charcoal.  This
cooking style cause superficial roasting and
the interior parts of the meat remains raw.
This is the main reason for the high preva-
lence of STEC strains in this food product.
Using  from  un-washed  vegetables  caused
high  prevalence  of  STEC  strains  in  salad
samples of our study. 

Another  part  of  our  findings  revealed
the high prevalence of STEC virulence fac-
tors  and  especially  stx1 and  eaeA.  High
presence  of  these  factors  in  EHEC  and
AEEC  subtypes showed  their  significant
pathogenicity  for  people  who  consumed
from these foods. Simultaneous presence of
stx1 and eaeA and stx2 and eaeA virulence
factors in some strains of E. coli of ready to
eat  foods  represented  an  important  public
health  issue  regarding  the  consumption  of
ready to eat foods.  

Several  investigations  have  been  con-
ducted in this field al-around the world.13-16
Momtaz et al.13 reported that the prevalence
of E. coli strains among meat samples was
29.02%.  They  showed  a  considerable
prevalence  of  E.  coli
in  sheep  meat
(35.45%). The results of their investigation
revealed  the  higher  prevalence  of  AEEC
than EHEC subtypes and also considerable
distribution of stx1 and eaeA virulence fac-
tors.  Hemmatinezhad  et  al.14 reported  that
the prevalence of E. coli in various types of
foods had a range of 9-28%. They showed
that  the  prevalence  of  stx1 gene  in  the
AEEC  strains  was  100%  and  EHEC-posi-
tive strains harbored all three stx1, eaeA and
ehly genes. Ranjbar et al.15 showed that the
prevalence of E. coli in various types of raw
and cooked food samples was 6.72%. They
showed  that  prevalence  of  E.  coli in  raw
meat,  raw  chicken  and  raw  fish,  cooked
meat, cooked chicken, cooked fish and soup
samples  were  20%,  16.66%,  1.42%,  6%,
3%,  2.72%  and  5%,  respectively.  They
showed  that  prevalence  of  EHEC  and
AEEC  subtypes  in  raw  meat  and  chicken,
cooked  meat,  chicken  and  fish  and  soup
samples  were  16.66%  and  50%,  20%  and
60%,  25%  and  50%,  0%  and  33.33%,0%
and 50% and 33.33% and 66.66%, respec-
tively.  Their  findings  showed  that  EHEC
strains  harbored  all  three  stx1,  eaeA and
ehly genes  together  (100%),  while  AEEC
strains  harbored  different  percent  of  these
genes. Shayegh et al.16 reported that 22 out
of 200 samples studied (11%) were positive
for E. coli. They represented that 54.54% of
E. coli isolates were STEC. In addition to
our  results  and  also  finding  of  Momtaz  et
al.,13 Hemmatinezhad  et  al.14 and  Ranjbar
et  al.,15 simultaneous  presences  of  stx1,

stx2, eaeA and ehly virulence factors have
also  been  reported  by  Franz  et al.,17 Jay-
Russell et al.18 and Kabiru et al.19

Conclusions

In  conclusions,  we  identified  a  large
numbers  of  virulence  factors  in  the  STEC
strains  isolated  from  ready  to  eat  foods.
High contamination rate of salad, candy and
barbecue  and  considerable  prevalence  of
stx1 and  eaeA virulence  factors  were  the
most  commonly  determined  properties  of
STEC  strains  of  ready  to  eat  foods.
Presence  of  EHEC  strains  in  majority  of
food samples represents inadequacy of time
and  temperature  used  for  cooking  of  food
samples and also transmission of pathogen-
ic  agents  from  animal  sources  to  them.  It
seems that there were no firm managements
on the principles of food hygiene in Iranian
ready to eat foods. However, further studies
are required to determine the distribution of
serotypes  and  antibiotic  resistance  proper-
ties of STEC strains and also their sequenc-
ing to found important epidemiological data
about the presence of STEC strains in ready
to eat foods.
