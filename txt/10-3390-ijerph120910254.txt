Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence, antibiotic susceptibility 
profiles, and virulence genes determinants of S. aureus isolated from milk obtained from 
retail outlets of the North-West Province, South Africa. To achieve this, 200 samples of raw, 
bulk and pasteurised milk were obtained randomly from supermarkets, shops and some farms 
in the North-West Province between May 2012 and April 2013. S. aureus was isolated and 
positively identified using morphological (Gram staining), biochemical (DNase, catalase, 
haemolysis and rapid slide agglutination) tests, protein profile analysis (MALDI-TOF mass 
spectrometry)  and  molecular  (nuc  specific  PCR)  methods.  The  antimicrobial  resistance 
profiles of the isolates were determined using the phenotypic agar diffusion method. Genes 
encoding enterotoxins, exfoliative toxins and collagen adhesins were also screened using 
PCR. Among all the samples examined, 30 of 40 raw milk samples (75%), 25 of 85 bulk 
milk  samples  (29%)  and  10  of  75  pasteurised  milk  samples  (13%)  were  positive  for  S. 
aureus. One hundred and fifty-six PCR-confirmed S. aureus isolates were obtained from 75 
contaminated milk samples. A large proportion (60%–100%) of the isolates was resistant to 
penicillin  G,  ampicillin,  oxacillin,  vancomycin,  teicoplanin  and  erythromycin.  On  the

contrary, low level resistance (8.3%–40%) was observed for gentamicin, kanamycin and 
sulphamethoxazole. Methicillin resistance was detected in 59% of the multidrug resistant 
isolates and this was a cause for concern. However, only a small proportion (20.6%) of these 
isolates possessed PBP2a which codes for Methicillin resistance in S. aureus. In addition, 
32.7% of isolates possessed the sec gene whereas the sea, seb sed, see, cna, eta, etb genes 
were not detected. The findings of this study showed that raw, bulk and pasteurised milk in 
the North-West Province is contaminated with toxigenic and multi-drug resistant S. aureus 
strains. There is a need to implement appropriate control measures to reduce contamination 
as well as the spread of virulent S. aureus strains and the burden of disease in humans.

1. Introduction 

Milk is high in nutrients such as vitamins, proteins, lactose, fat, minerals and water. It plays an important 
role in assisting individuals meet their nutrient requirements [1–4]. It has been reported worldwide that 
foods of animal origin, particularly milk and other dairy products, are often associated with food-borne 
diseases if proper sanitary and health care procedures are not implemented during the production and 
marketing of these products [5–7]. This is mainly due to the fact that milk may serve as an excellent 
medium  for  the  survival  and  growth  of  many  different  types  of  pathogenic  microorganisms.  Milk  is 
regarded as a potential vehicle for the transmission of bacteria, including staphylococci to humans [8,9]. 
Staphylococci are bacteria that easily grow and establish themselves as commensals on the skin and 
mucous membranes of warm-blooded animals [10–14]. In line with this, a number of coagulase positive 
and coagulase negative species have been isolated from humans and animals [11,12,15–17]. However, 
S. aureus is well known as a pathogen in both human and animal medicine, and it is currently considered 
as  one  of  the  world’s  most  important  pathogens  [18].  S.  aureus  is  known  to  cause  a  number  of 
pathological  conditions  in  humans  and  animals  that  range  from  mild  skin  infections,  bacteremia, 
systemic diseases, osteomyelitis to the more complicated toxic shock syndrome and staphylococcal food 
poisoning (SFP) [18–20]. 

S. aureus is reported to be one of the most common causative agents of food poisoning associated 
with the consumption of raw milk and milk products [21]. Foodstuff contamination may occur directly 
from infected food-producing animals or may result from poor hygiene during production processes, or 
the retail and storage of food, since humans may also harbour microorganisms [8,9,22]. As such, food 
products such as milk, cheese, yoghurt and other dairy products have been implicated as potential sources 
for  the  transmission  of  the  pathogen  to  humans  [8].  Moreover,  foods  contaminated  with  antibiotic 
resistant bacteria represent ideal vehicles for the transmission of antibiotic resistant strains [23,24]. 

Antimicrobial  resistance  is  an  important  health  problem  worldwide  [25,26].  The  development  of 
resistance, both in human and animal bacterial pathogens, has been ascribed to the extensive therapeutic 
use  of  antimicrobials  or  with  their  use  as  growth  promoters  in  animal  feed  production  [27–30].

Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was first described in 1961, shortly after the introduction of 
methicillin [31]. S. aureus becomes methicillin resistant by acquisition of the mecA gene which encodes 
a  modified  penicillin  binding  protein  (PBP2a)  that  has  a  low  affinity  for  β-lactams  [8,32,33].  The 
modified PBP2a in MRSA isolates is therefore capable of replacing the biosynthetic functions of normal 
penicillin binding proteins even in the presence of β-lactam antibiotics, thereby preventing cell lysis. As 
such, S. aureus strains producing PBP2a are resistant to all β-lactam antibiotics [32] as well as other 
classes of antibiotics. Since the development of MRSA, vancomycin has been used as the antibiotic of 
choice to treat infections caused by S. aureus strains that are resistant to methicillin and oxacillin. In 
addition, the emergence of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus has been reported in some studies [16,34,35]. 
The multi-drug resistant S. aureus strains may have an increased ability to spread, especially if they 
are also enhanced with virulence genes. This does not only provide therapeutic challenges for clinicians 
but may be very detrimental to human health [36]. The study was designed to determine the occurrence 
of S. aureus and MRSA strains in milk products obtained from some supermarkets, shops and farms in 
the North West Province of South Africa. Moreover, the possible health risks to consumers based on the 
presence of virulence genes and antibiotic resistance profiles of the isolates were also investigated. 

2. Experimental Section 

2.1. Study Design 

A cross-sectional study design was used to determine the bacteriological analysis of raw, tank and 

pasteurised milk in the North-West Province of South Africa. 

2.2. Study Site 

This study was conducted in Mafikeng town, North-West Province of South Africa. The province has 
an estimated population of 3,509,953 million inhabitants [37]. The North-West province is located in 
the north of South Africa, on the Botswana border. It is surrounded by the Kalahari desert to the west, 
Gauteng province to the east, and the Free State to the south. 

2.3. Sample Collection 

From May 2012 to April 2013, a total of 200 milk samples including raw, bulk and pasteurised milk 
were randomly collected from 18 sources (supermarkets, shops and farms) in the four districts of the 
North-West province of South Africa (Table 2). Two to five (the number depends on the size of the 
district) representative stores were chosen in each district for sampling. Each milk sample (500 mL) was 
collected, labelled properly, kept at 4 °C in an insulated ice box and transported to the laboratory for 
analysis. Upon arrival in the laboratory, samples were analysed for S. aureus within 4 h of collection. 

2.4. Enrichments and Isolation of S. aureus 

Isolation  of  S.  aureus  was  done  as  described  [38].  Isolation  involved  a  non-selective  enrichment 
procedure [39] where a 5 mL aliquot of each milk sample was mixed with 5 mL double strength Trypticase 
Soy Broth (TSB) (Biolab, Wadeville, South Africa). This preparation was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Ten 

 

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 
 
milliliters of a single-strength TSB supplemented with 20% NaCl was later added and incubated for 24 h 
at 37 °C. Aliquots of 0.1 mL were spread-plated onto mannitol salt agar (MSA) (Biolab, Modderfontein, 
South Africa). The plates were incubated aerobically at 37 °C for 24 h. Presumptive S. aureus colonies 
that were yellow in colour from each MSA (Biolab, Modderfontein, South Africa) plate were sub-cultured 
onto  fresh  MSA  (Biolab,  Modderfontein,  South  Africa)  plates  for  isolate  purification  and  incubated 
aerobically at 37 °C for 24 h. Isolates were retained for further identification.

2.5. Bacterial Identification 

Presumptive  S.  aureus  colonies  were  identified  by  standard  microbiological  tests  which  included 
Gram-staining; catalase testing (using 3% hydrogen peroxide); slide agglutination test; DNase test; and 
the oxidation and fermentation of mannitol salt agar (Biolab, Modderfontein, South Africa) [40]. 

2.5.1. Biochemical Identification of Staphylococci 

Isolates were Gram-stained using standard techniques [41]. Colonies that were Gram-positive cocci, 
arranged in clusters, were further identified. S. aureus isolates were screened for DNase production using 
the  DNase  agar  (Fluka®  Analytical:  Sigma-Aldrich  Chemie  GmbH,  Buchs,  Switzerland)  [42],  the 
catalase test [43], haemolysin test using 5% (w/v) sheep blood agar [44] and slide agglutination test 
using  the  PASTOREXTM  STAPH-PLUS  (Bio-Rad  Laboratories  Diagnostics  Group,  Redmond,  WA, 
USA)  which  facilitates  simultaneous  detection  of  bound  coagulase  also  known  as  clumping  factor; 
protein  A;  and  capsular  polysaccharides  that  are  specific  for  S.  aureus.  All  tests  were  performed 
according to standard guidelines and S. aureus (ATCC® 25923) was used as a positive control in each 
test protocol. 

2.6. Determination of the Identities of Isolates using the Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization 
Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) 

Pure isolates were sub-cultured on MSA agar and plates incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The plates were 
transported to the Microbiology Laboratory of the University of Pretoria (South Africa) for MALDI-TOF 
MS analysis by the equipment specialist using standard protocols and procedures. The MALDI Biotyper 
identifies  organisms  using  the  Matrix-Assisted  Laser  Desorption/Ionization  Mass  Spectrometry  by 
measuring the unique protein fingerprint of highly abundant proteins in an organism. The characteristic 
patterns  of  these  proteins  are  used  to  reliably  identify  the  particular  microorganism  by  matching  the 
respective patterns with an extensive open database. Analysis was performed and isolates identified to 
species level. 

2.7. Molecular Identification by PCR 

2.7.1. DNA Extraction 

Genomic DNA was extracted using a ZR Genomic DNATM–Tissue MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research 
Corp, Irvine, CA, USA). The extraction protocol used was as instructed by the manufacturer. The quality 
and quantity of the extracted genomic DNA was determined using a Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer 

 

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 
 
(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and diluted to a working concentration of 50 ng/μL. The eluted 
DNA was stored at −20 °C and used for molecular identification of the isolates.

2.7.2. 16S rRNA Specific PCR for the Detection of Staphylococci 

The identities of organisms belonging to the genus staphylococci were determined using a 16S rRNA 
specific PCR assay that amplifies the 16S rRNA gene sequence specific for staphylococci [45]. Primer 
sequences used are shown in Table 1. PCR was conducted using a C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler (Bio-
Rad, Johannesburg, South Africa) and the cycling conditions were an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 
min; followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 seconds, 64 °C for 30 seconds, 72 °C for 60 seconds and a 
final elongation step of 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were stored at 4 °C and later separated by 
agarose gel electrophoresis. 

2.7.3. Specific PCR for the Identification of Staphylococcus aureus 

The  identities  of  S.  aureus  isolates  were  confirmed  using  a  specific  PCR  that  targeted  the 
thermonuclease (nuc) gene specific for S. aureus [46] using primers sequences listed in Table 1. PCR 
was conducted using a C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, Johannesburg, South Africa) and the 
cycling  conditions  utilized  were  initial  denaturation  of  94  °C  for  5  min;  followed  by  30  cycles  of  
94 °C for 30 seconds, 55 °C for 30 seconds, 72 °C for 60 seconds and a final elongation step of 72 °C 
for 5 min. The PCR products were stored at 4 oC and later separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. After 
identification, each S. aureus strain was stored at −80 °C in Brain Heart Infusion broth (BHI) (Oxoid, 
Basingstoke, UK) with glycerol (15% v/v). 

2.8. Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Detection of Gene Sequences that Encode Virulence 
Determinants in S. aureus 

Multiplex PCR was used to screen for the presence of genes encoding different virulent determinants: 
staphylococcal  enterotoxins  A  to  E  (sea,  seb,  sec,  sed  and  see)  [47],  exfoliative  toxins  A  and  B  
(eta and etb) [48] and cna gene [49]. Primer sequences used for the PCR assays are listed in Table 1.  
Two sets of multiplex PCR mixes containing enterotoxins A to E primers and another with eta, etb and 
cna  primers  were  prepared.  Each  of  the  multiplex  PCR  mix  contained  10–50  ng  of  template  DNA,  
1.5 µL of 25 mM MgCl2 (Promega Corporation, Madison, USA), 1.5 µL of 5 × Green Go Taq® reaction 
buffer (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA), 12.5 µL of 2 × PCR master mix (Thermo Scientific, 
Johannesburg, Sounth Africa) and 50 pmol of each primer (Inqaba Biotech, Pretoria, Sounth Africa). 
The volume of this reaction mixes was adjusted to 25 µL with nuclease free water. DNA amplification 
was carried out in a C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, Johannesburg, South Africa) with the 
following cycling conditions: an initial denaturation of 94 °C for 5 min was followed by 35 cycles of 
amplification (denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, annealing at 57 °C for 2 min and extension at 72 °C for 
1 min), ending with a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min.

2.9. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis of DNA Extracted and PCR Products 

10259 

DNA extracted and PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% (w/v) and 2% (w/v) 
agarose (Sigma-Aldrich, Seakme®, Rockland, ME, USA) gel. A 100 bp or 1 kb DNA ladder (Fermentas, 
Glen Burnie, GB, USA) was included in all PCR and fingerprinting gels as a molecular weight standard. 
ChemiDocTM MP Imaging system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) was used to visualise and capture  
the images.

2.10. Determination of the Antibiotic Resistance Profiles of S. aureus Isolates 

Antibiotic Disc Susceptibility Test, Detection of Multiple Antibiotic Resistant (MAR) Phenotypes and 
Penicillin Binding Protein (PBP2a) 

An antibiotic susceptibility test was performed using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method [50]. 
Susceptibilities of the isolates to a panel of 11 different antimicrobial agents that include penicillin G 
(10  μg),  oxacillin  (5  μg),  ampicillin  (10  μg),  streptomycin  (10  μg),  kanamycin  (30  μg),  gentamicin  
(10 μg), erythromycin (15 μg), oxytetracycline (30 μg), vancomycin (30 μg), teicoplanin (30 μg) and 
sulphamethoxazole  (15  μg)  (Mast  Diagnostics,  Merseyside,  UK)  were  determined.  The  test  was 
performed and results were interpreted according to standard guidelines [51]. All isolates were tested for 
the  production  of  PBP2a,  the  protein  encoded  by  mecA,  using  the  PBP2a  latex  agglutination  assay  
(Bio-Lab, Pretoria, South Africa) that employs a serological procedure for the detection of Methicillin 

 

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 
 
and Oxacillin resistant S. aureus. The test was performed as instructed by the manufacturer. The MAR 
phenotypes were generated for isolates resistant to three and more antibiotics using the abbreviations 
that appear on antibiotic discs [52]. A methicillin susceptible S. aureus (ATCC® 25923) and an MRSA 
strain (ATCC® 43300) were used as a negative and positive control, respectively.

3. Results 

3.1. Presumptive Detection of Staphylococcus Species in Milk Samples Based on Cultural Characteristics 

A total of 200 milk samples were collected and screened for the presence of Staphylococcus species. 
This comprised of 40 samples from raw milk, 85 from tank milk and 75 from pasteurised milk. The 
bacterium was detected in 75% (30/40), 29% (25/85), 13% (10/75) of raw milk (RM), tank milk (TM) 
and pasteurised milk (PM), respectively. The overall occurrence of S. aureus contamination in the milk 
samples was 32.5% (65/200).  

A  total  of  380  isolates  obtained  from  the  contaminated  milk  samples  were  screened  for  the 
characteristics of S. aureus. Only isolates that satisfied both preliminary and confirmatory biochemical 
tests, such as Gram staining, catalase test, slide agglutination test, DNase test were considered. A large 
proportion 56% (211/380) of the isolates were positively identified by using the slide agglutination test. 
All the isolates were Gram-positive and catalase-positive and a large number 65% (138/211) of the 
isolates  were  positive  for  DNase  production.  The  majority  of  the  isolates  74%  (156/211)  showed 
haemolytic  activity  on  sheep  blood  agar  plates:  50%  (78/156)  of  the  haemolytic  S  aureus  isolates 
produced  α-haemolysin  while  44%  (69/156)  displayed  β-haemolysis  and  6%  (9/156)  were  α  and  
β-haemolytic. The results revealed that S. aureus was frequently isolated from milk samples obtained 
from the North-West Province. Although all the milk samples were contaminated with S. aureus, isolates 
obtained from Coligny, Wolmaranstad, Lehurutshe and Madibogo were not positively identified by the 
slide agglutination test and thus not included in the study. The results in Tables 5A and 5B indicate the 
number  of  isolates  screened  from  the  different  sampling  areas  and  those  that  were  positive  for  the 
different tests. All the isolates that were positively identified as S. aureus by the slide agglutination test 
were subjected to confirmatory identification using molecular methods. In this study, staphylococci were 
detected in all the different types of milk samples analysed. Bacteria were more frequently isolated from 
raw milk than tank milk and pasteurised milk obtained from the supermarkets. 

3.2. Molecular Characterisation of S. aureus Isolates from Milk 

3.2.1. Specific PCR for the Identification of Staphylococcus aureus 

A total of 211 S. aureus isolates that were positively identified by the Staph Xtra Latex agglutination 
test  were  subjected  to  specific  simplex  PCR  analysis  for  the  detection  of  16S  rRNA  gene  and  the  
S. aureus thermonuclease (nuc) gene. The 16S rRNA gene is specific for the genus Staphylococcus while 
the  nuc  gene  is  species  specific  for  S.  aureus.  A  Figure  of  a  2%  (w/v)  agarose  gel  depicting  the  
16S rRNA gene fragments amplified by PCR using genomic DNA extracted from S. aureus isolates was 
reported as Supplementary Material. The 16S rRNA and nuc gene fragments with the expected amplicon 
sizes of 228bp and 279bp were respectively obtained and the agarose gel pictures were reported as 

 

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 
 
Supplementary Material. Table 2 shows the number of isolates screened from the different sampling 
sites and those that were positive for the targeted genes. 

10261 

As shown in Table 2, the proportion of isolates that was positive for the 16S rRNA gene (100%) PCR 
analysis was higher than those that possessed the nuc gene (74%). This is not surprising since the nuc 
gene is more specific in detecting isolates belonging to the species S. aureus compared to the 16S rRNA 
gene  that  is  common  to  the  genus  Staphylococcus  and  will  detect  other  Staphylococcus  species  in 
addition to S. aureus. 

3.2.2. Detection of Virulence Genes in Staphylococcus aureus Isolates 

A  total  of  156  S.  aureus  isolates  were  subjected  to  multiplex  PCR  analysis  for  the  detection  of 
virulence genes. Results obtained are shown in Table 2. Only the sec virulence gene was amplified from 
isolates screened and the sea, seb, sed, see, cna, eta and etb genes were not detected in any of the isolates. 
Generally, 51 (32.7%) of the isolates possessed the sec gene and a large proportion of the isolates were 
obtained from Rooigrond (47%) and Disaneng (24%). None of the isolates from Rustenburg, Mabule, 
Taung and Lehurutshe possessed the sec virulence determinant. A 2% (w/v) agarose gel depicting the 
sec virulence gene fragments amplified by PCR using genomic DNA extracted from S. aureus isolates 
was reported as Supplementary Material. Amplicons obtained were of the expected sizes (451 bp).

3.3. Identification of S. aureus Isolates Using the MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry 

A total of 36 S. aureus isolates that were positive for the 16S rRNA gene and the nuc gene PCR 
analysis  were  subjected  to  the  MALDI  Biotyper  identification  tool  using  the  Matrix-Assisted  Laser 
Desorption/Ionization  Mass  Spectrometry.  Using  the  isolates  obtained  from  the  present  study  as 

 

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 
 
unknowns, highly reproducible mass spectral profiles were obtained and compared with those of the 
reference  spectra  deposited  in  an  extensive  open  database.  Unique  protein  fingerprints  of  highly 
abundant proteins in each isolate were obtained. A representation of the proteins profiles, peaks and 
mass  spectral  profiles  of  representative  S.  aureus  isolates  from  milk  obtained  from  Rooigrond  was 
reported as Supplementary Material. The identities of isolates obtained after analysis and the scores used 
to determine the reliability of the technique in classifying an isolate as member of a particular genus and 
species are shown in Table 3. All the isolates were positively identified as S. aureus to species level.

As shown in Table 3, the score value for best match organism of all the isolates screened ranged from 
2.027 to 2.338 indicating a reliable genus and species identification. Moreover, the greatest peak density or 
hits of mass ions were detected at about m/z 2800 and all the isolates correctly identified to genus and species 
level as S. aureus. Generally, all the isolates showed similar profiles and it is suggested that the consistent 
mass ions at m/z 2000 to m/z 10000 appear to be biomarkers specific for the S. aureus specie. When the nuc 
specific PCR and the MALDI-TOF MS data were compared, it was evident that both could be used for 
correct identification of bacteria isolates under controlled laboratory and experimental conditions. 

3.4. Antibiotic Resistance of S. aureus Isolates from Milk Samples 

A total 156 S. aureus isolates from milk obtained from different sampling sites in the North-West 
Province that possessed the nuc gene were tested to evaluate their susceptibilities against a panel of  
11 antimicrobial agents. Data depicting the susceptibilities of the isolates were presented in percentages 
as  shown  in  Table  4.  A  large  proportion  (60%–100%)  of  the  S.  aureus  isolates  obtained  from 
Carletonville,  Potchefstroom  and  Zeerust  were  resistant  to  penicillin  G,  ampicillin,  oxacillin, 
streptomycin, vancomycin, and erythromycin. In addition, a similarly large proportion of isolates from 
Swartruggens, Rustenburg, Stella, Setlagole, Vryburg, Taung and Disaneng were resistant to penicillin 
G and oxacillin (Table 4). Despite the fact that a relatively large proportion (50%–71%) of the isolates 
from  Vryburg,  Setlagole  and  Disaneng  were  resistant  to  gentamicin,  on  the  contrary,  only  a  small 
proportion (8.3%–40%) of isolates from the other stations sampled were resistant to this antimicrobial 
agent. With the exception of Disaneng, Carletonville and Potchefstroom all isolates obtained from the 
other sample sites were highly susceptible to kanamycin. Similar low level resistance was observed 
against sulphamethoxazole (Table 4). A cause for concern is the fact that multiple antibiotic resistant 
(MAR) isolates that are also resistant to oxacillin were detected in this study. These isolates could serve 
as reservoirs for the transmission and spread of antibiotic resistant determinants within a population. 

3.5. Latex Agglutination Assay for the Detection of Penicillin Binding Protein 2a (PBP2a) in S. aureus 
Isolates from Milk Samples 

A total of 92 MAR antibiotic resistant S. aureus strains isolated from milk obtained from different 
sampling sites in the North-West Province were subjected to a serological test using the Latex PBP2a 
test kit. This aim was to detect PBP2a which is used to identify Methicillin resistance in S. aureus and 
the Latex technology provides an alternative to the PCR technique to detect the mecA gene product 
serologically. All the 92 isolates were resistant to oxacillin based on the antibiotic disc susceptibility 
test. Results obtained are shown in Table 5. Despite the fact that only a small proportion (19) 20.6% of 
the  isolates  were  positively  identified  to  possess  the  gene  responsible  for  Methicillin  resistance  in  
S. aureus, the presence of this gene was a cause for concern. Moreover, the ability to determine whether 
a test is positive or not depends on the person interpreting the results and therefore the actual occurrence 
of PBP2a may be higher than the reported value. Consequently, the isolates were also screened by PCR 
analysis for the mecA gene.

3.6. Multiple Antibiotic Resistance Phenotypes of S. aureus Isolates from Milk Samples 

Multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) phenotypes were generated from 110 S. aureus isolates showing 
resistance to three or more antibiotics [52]. Data indicating the predominant MAR phenotypes are shown 
in Table 6. The MAR phenotype PG-AMP-VA-TEC-TE-E was observed in 60% of isolates from Taung, 
while 25% of those from Mafikeng displayed this phenotype. The MAR phenotypes PG-AMP-OX-S-
VA-TEC-E  was  dominant  among  50%,  30%  and  29%  of  samples  from  Potchefstroom,  Zeerust  and 
Carletonville,  respectively.  The  predominant  MAR  phenotypes  for  isolates  from  raw  milk  from 
Disaneng and pasteurized milk from Vryburg were PG-AMP-OX-S-K-CN-VA-TEC-E and PG-AMP-
SK-VA-TEC-TE-E-SMX obtained at 20% and 30%, respectively. These results reveal that MAR S.

aureus were isolated from milk samples. It is therefore suggested that these MAR isolates may have 
severe health implications in individuals who consume such milk products.

4. Discussion 

The primary objective of this study has been to isolate and identify S. aureus from milk obtained from 
supermarkets, shops and farms around the North-West Province, South Africa. The main motivation is 
that  food-borne  pathogens,  including  S.  aureus,  have  been  isolated  from  milk  and  dairy  products 
worldwide [53–56]. Moreover, a baseline study previously conducted in the area revealed the presence 
of S. aureus in milk collected from a communal farm and two commercial farms [35]. Despite the fact 
that outbreaks and even sporadic cases of staphylococcal food poisoning have rarely been reported to 
date in South Africa, the pathogen has been isolated from milk and food products in the area [35,56]. 
This therefore indicates that there is a possibility of transmitting S. aureus and their associated virulence 
determinants to consumers when unpasteurised milk or its associated products are consumed as is the 
case in some rural communities in the North West Province of South Africa. 

Reasonable attention has been given to pathogenic S. aureus strains, especially those equipped with 
virulence factors even in developed countries that have proper public health facilities [5,57,58]. There is 
currently little information on the occurrence of this pathogen and its associated virulence determinants 
in South Africa [35,56]. Data on the occurrence of S. aureus and MRSA in South Africa among animals 
and humans is limited and the determination of its presence in milk may provide an indication of the 
health risks associated with the consumption of these products and serve as a tool for assessing its public 
health  risks.  Previous  studies  have  evaluated  the  presence  of  S.  aureus  in  milk  using  conventional 
microbiology  methods  [35].  The  present  study  is  the  first  in  the  area  in  which  a  combination  of 
phenotypic,  genotypic  and  proteomic  tools  were  used  to  concurrently  determine  the  occurrence, 
antibiotic resistance profiles and virulence gene profiles of S. aureus strains isolated from milk samples 
obtained from retail outlets and farms in the North-West Province, South Africa. Data obtained could 
provide options for developing S. aureus control strategies in the study area. 

In  the  present  study,  the  overall  presence  of  the  pathogen  was  32.5%  among  samples  screened. 
However, the proportion of S. aureus was higher (75%) in raw milk than in pasteurised milk (29%). This 
observation was not surprising although it is a cause for concern. The presence of these bacteria, after 
pasteurisation,  can  be  attributed  to  inefficacy  of  the  thermal  process  or  post-process  contamination. 
Similar observations have been noticed in which there was a high occurrence of S. aureus from raw and 
pasteurised  milk  [5,49,59,60].  However,  contrary  to  observations  made  in  some  studies,  lower 
proportions of the pathogen have been reported [61,62]. It is therefore suggested that the occurrence of 

 

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 
 
S.  aureus  in  milk  samples  greatly  depends  on  the  methods  used  for  isolation,  the  sample  size  and 
geographical region. 

10267 

In  this  study,  the  Pastorex  Staph-plus  serological  assay,  amplification  of  Staphylococcus  genus 
specific 16S rRNA gene fragment and the thermo nuclease gene (nuc) specific for S. aureus, and the 
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry were used for positive identification of S. aureus strains. Traditionally, 
bacteria species are identified using phenotypic traits based on results obtained for biochemical tests. 
Despite the fact that biochemical protocols and assays are constantly being refined, results obtained from 
these  tests  are  usually  not  very  reliable,  and  are  time  consuming  [63].  The  matrix-assisted  laser 
desorption/ionisation  time  of  light  mass  spectrometry  (MALDI-TOF  MS)  of  intact  cells  has  been 
reported  to  be  an  attractive  alternative  method  that  is  accurate,  rapid,  and  requires  minimal  sample 
preparation time for the correct identification of bacteria isolates. 

Different studies have been conducted in which various identification tools were employed for detecting 
S. aureus [62–64]. Regardless of the isolation and identification techniques employed, the presence of 
these pathogens in milk highlights the need for both strict farm management practices and proper sanitary 
procedures to be implemented during milking operations such as storage, handling and transportation, 
which are considered to be critical points for S. aureus cross contamination. It is therefore suggested that 
the presence of S. aureus in pasteurised milk samples that have not gone past their expiry dates could be 
attributed to improper handling and holding temperatures during the storage and retail of the products. 

Another  objective  of  the  study  was  to  determine  and  compare  the  antibiotic  resistance  profiles  of  
S. aureus strains isolated from milk samples which may enter the food chain and be transmitted to humans. 
A motivation for this is that recent studies have revealed an increasing trend towards the occurrence of 
multiple antibiotic resistant S. aureus isolates worldwide [8,35,65]. S. aureus isolates that harbour multiple 
antibiotic  resistant  traits  have  been  reported  to  negatively  impact  on  the  treatment  of  staphylococcal 
infections, especially in immune-compromised individuals, the elderly and young children [66]. In the 
present study, multiple antibiotic resistant S. aureus strains defined as isolates resistant to three or more 
antibiotics  were  obtained  in  a  large  proportion  of  milk  samples  analysed.  Development  of  multiple 
antibiotic resistance among most of these isolates may be attributed to the acquisition of resistance (R-
factor) which is plasmid-mediated [67]. Usually, S. aureus is known to contain a number of multiple 
antibiotic  resistant  plasmids  that  may  account  for  the  phenotypes  observed  [67].  In  general,  a  large 
proportion (60%–100%) of the isolates from different areas and sample types were resistant to penicillin 
G,  ampicillin,  oxacillin,  streptomycin, vancomycin, tetracycline and erythromycin.  Similar  patterns  of 
resistance have been reported against S. aureus in previous studies [65,68]. 

The misuse of antibiotics in dairy farms is currently known to be one of the major factors responsible 
for the emergence of drug resistant bacteria worldwide. Ampicillin and tetracycline are mostly used on 
dairy cattle farms in the study area and this may account for the resistance levels observed. Furthermore, 
isolates  that  are  resistant  to  ampicillin  may  cross-select  for  resistance  to  other  β-lactam  antibiotics 
including  penicillin  and  ampicillin  resistant  isolates  may  portray  β-lactam  characteristics  and 
phenotypes. Despite the fact that erythromycin and vancomycin are not used in the area, it has been 
reported that the use of macrolides tylosin and avoparcin as growth promoters in animals was associated 
with the emergence of Erythromycin and vancomycin resistance in S. aureus [69]. 

Contrary  to  the  above  trends,  smaller  proportions  (22.8%–28%)  of  the  isolates  were  resistant  to 
Gentamicin,  Kanamycin  and  sulphamethoxazole.  Similar  observations  have  been  previously  
 

10268

reported [63,70]. In addition, these trends may be due to the fact that the antimicrobial agents are rarely or 
not used at all in animal and human medicine.  However, a cause for concern was the detection of 
oxacillin resistant S. aureus isolates in the study using the antibiotic disc susceptibility phenotypic assay 
despite the fact that the drug is rarely used in both human and animal medicine worldwide. Similar 
observations have been reported for S. aureus from animals, humans, food and water sources [60,62]. 
Methicillin resistance in staphylococci is due to the presence of the mecA gene that encodes for an altered 
penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a) and therefore, has reduced affinity for β-lactam antibiotics [16]. 
However, in the present study, only a small proportion (12.1%) of the isolates that exhibited phenotypic 
resistance to Oxacillin expressed the PBP2a and thus carried the mecA gene. Similar observations have 
previously been reported and it is suggested that in some S. aureus strains, phenotypic resistance to 
oxacillin is not intrinsically mediated by the mecA gene [48,71,72], but it is executed through other 
mechanisms.  This  non-mecA  mediated  resistance  is  caused  by  modifications  to  the  penicillin  binding 
proteins, which results in hyper-production of beta-lactamase or methicillinase enzymes [71]. However, the 
detection of non-mecA, S. aureus strains that are phenotypically resistant to oxacillin and methicillin are 
known to pose serious health concerns and are of great clinical relevance [72]. Moreover, these non-mecA S. 
aureus strains are still classified as MRSA isolates [72]. Therefore, epidemiological investigations are needed 
to constantly monitor the antibiotic resistance profile of S. aureus strains isolated from different sources 
in a given area and to implement reliable genetic tracking tools that would facilitate the detection of 
point source contamination within the food chain. This would greatly reduce the transmission of these 
pathogens to consumers and reduce the incidence of staphylococcal infections in humans. 

A further objective of the study was to determine the presence of staphylococcal virulence genes that 
include  enterotoxin  genes,  exfoliative  genes  and  collagen  adhesin  (cna)  genes  using  specific  PCR 
analysis.  Enterotoxin  genes  are  known  to  be  the  major  virulence  factors  of  S.  aureus  and  therefore 
responsible for most of the pathogenicity observed in humans, especially when the pathogen is consumed 
in food products [18]. These toxins are known to modulate immune response through super antigen 
activity and various diseases caused by strains that produce them [73]. 

Previous reports designed to detect these toxin genes (enterotoxins, eta and etb genes) in S. aureus 
revealed great diversity of these genes among isolates from different areas [74,75]. Despite the fact that 
in  the  present  study  32%  of  isolates  tested  possessed  the  sec  gene,  none  of  the  other  virulence 
determinants were detected.  This is not very surprising since the sec gene has been previously reported 
to be the most prevalent virulence factor among S. aureus isolates [75,76]. However, the detection of S. 
aureus strains that harbour the sec virulence gene indicates that these isolates have the potential to cause 
either sporadic cases or food borne outbreaks of infections [68]. 

Similar to previous reports, none of the eta, etb and cna virulence genes were detected in this 
study [57,77]. In S. aureus, the exfoliative toxin genes are associated with bullous impetigo [78] 
while the collagen adhesin protein (cna) gene mediates the binding of clinical isolates to host specific 
matrix [73]. The cna gene is frequently associated with clinical S. aureus isolates, although it has 
also been detected in isolates from both food and environmental sources [75]. Moreover, the cna 
gene product is not easily detected S. aureus strains by PCR analysis [79]. 

In the present study, isolates were assayed for other putative virulence factors including haemolytic 
activity,  the  presence  of  the  coagulase  enzyme  and  DNase  production  that  enhance  the  pathogenic 
characteristics of S. aureus isolates [80]. All the isolates were positive for coagulase activity, which enables 
 

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 
 
them to promote the clotting of fibrin in the blood stream and this is a mechanism by which pathogens 
protect themselves from destruction during infection [81]. It is therefore suggested that these isolates may 
present health complications to humans if consumed in contaminated milk or its associated products.

5. Conclusions 

In the present study, S. aureus was successfully isolated from milk samples and a large proportion of 
S. aureus isolates exhibited resistance towards the 11 different antibiotics tested. Thus, it is evident that 
most of the isolates possessed multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) attributes. Though the development 
of antibiotic resistant determinants in S. aureus is associated with the uncontrolled usage of antibiotics 
in human and veterinary medicine, the incidence of drug-resistant S. aureus in raw, tank and pasteurised 
milk samples warrants closer monitoring. 

The MAR isolates obtained in this study possessed a number of virulence factors such as haemolysin, 
coagulase, DNase, catalase, but only few of them carried the enterotoxin gene (sec). This supports the 
notion that though the epidemiological statistics of milk-borne diseases are unavailable, milk products 
possess pathogenic S. aureus strains and may be cause foodborne diseases in consumers. In addition, the 
sec gene was found to be the predominant enterotoxin gene in this genetically diverse South African 
milk isolates and the presence of this gene is not genotype specific.
