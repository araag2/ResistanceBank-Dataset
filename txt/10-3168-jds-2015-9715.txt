ABSTRACT

The  objectives  of  this  study  were  to  examine  the 
diversity of Staphylococcus spp. recovered from bovine 
intramammary infections and humans working in close 
contact with the animals and to evaluate the suscepti-
bility of the staphylococcal isolates to different antimi-
crobials. A total of 3,387 milk samples and 79 human 
nasal  swabs  were  collected  from  13  sampling  sites  in 
the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. In total, 
146 Staph. aureus isolates and 102 coagulase-negative 
staphylococci (CNS) were recovered from clinical and 
subclinical  milk  samples.  Staphylococcus aureus  was 
isolated from 12 (15.2%) of the human nasal swabs and 
95 representative CNS were recovered for further char-
acterization. The CNS were identified using multiplex-
PCR  assays,  matrix-assisted  laser  desorption/ioniza-
tion  time-of-flight  mass  spectrometry  (MALDI-TOF 
MS),  and  tuf  gene  sequencing.  Seven  Staphylococcus 
spp. were identified among the CNS of bovine origin, 
with  Staph. chromogenes  (78.4%)  predominating.  The 
predominant  CNS  species  recovered  from  the  human 
nasal swabs was Staph. epidermidis (80%) followed by 
Staph. chromogenes (6.3%). The antimicrobial suscepti-
bility of all staphylococcal isolates was evaluated using 
disk diffusion and was supplemented by screening for 
specific  antimicrobial  resistance  genes.  Ninety-eight 
(67.1%)  Staph. aureus  isolates  of  bovine  origin  were 
pansusceptible;  39  (26.7%)  isolates  were  resistant  to 
a single class, and 7 (4.8%) isolates were resistant to 
2 classes of antimicrobials. Two Staph. aureus (1.4%) 
isolates were multidrug-resistant. Resistance to penicil-
lin was common, with 28.8% of the bovine and 75% of 
the human Staph. aureus isolates exhibiting resistance. 
A similar observation was made with the CNS, where 
37.3% of the bovine and 89.5% of the human isolates 
were  resistant  to  penicillin.  Multidrug-resistance  was

common  among  the  human  CNS,  with  39%  of  the 
isolates  exhibiting  resistance  to  3  or  more  classes  of 
antimicrobials. The antimicrobial susceptibility results 
suggest  that  resistance  among  staphylococci  causing 
bovine intramammary infections in South Africa is un-
common and not a significant cause for concern. In con-
trast, antimicrobial resistance was frequently observed 
in  staphylococcal  isolates  of  human  origin,  highlight-
ing a possible reservoir of resistance genes. Continued 
monitoring  of  staphylococcal  isolates  is  warranted  to 
monitor changes in the susceptibility of isolates to dif-
ferent classes of antimicrobials.

INTRODUCTION

Bovine  mastitis,  or  inflammation  of  the  mammary 
gland,  is  one  of  the  most  common  and  economically 
important diseases affecting the dairy industry world-
wide (Barkema et al., 2006). Mastitis primarily occurs 
in response to microbial infections, although chemical, 
physical, or traumatic factors may also lead to inflam-
mation. A variety of bacteria have been implicated in 
bovine IMI (Gentilini et al., 2000), with staphylococci 
being considered one of the most significant and preva-
lent groups (Pyörälä et al., 2011).

Staphylococcus aureus is a contagious udder pathogen 
that readily spreads between cows at milking (Akineden 
et al., 2001). The main source of the bacterium is milk 
from infected quarters, with milking machine teat lin-
ers playing a significant role in the transmission of the 
bacteria among cows and mammary quarters (Zadoks 
et  al.,  2002).  It  is  imperative  that  infected  cows  are 
promptly  identified  so  that  appropriate  control  mea-
sures can be implemented to curb bacterial transmis-
sion (Barkema et al., 2006). Other Staphylococcus spp., 
the so-called CNS, have traditionally been regarded as 
opportunistic pathogens of minor importance. This per-
ception has arisen because mastitis caused by CNS is 
very mild and usually remains subclinical (Tenhagen et 
al., 2006). However, the significance of the CNS is being

reassessed because, in many countries including South 
Africa, CNS have become the most common bacteria 
isolated from bovine IMI (Petzer et al., 2009; Taponen 
and Pyörälä, 2009; Piessens et al., 2011; Sampimon et 
al., 2011).

At present, the CNS group comprises 51 species and 
25 subspecies (LPSN, 2015). In routine mastitis diag-
nostic  laboratories,  CNS  are  usually  not  identified  to 
the species level but are reported as a single group (Ta-
ponen  et  al.,  2012).  Consequently,  limited  knowledge 
is available regarding the epidemiology, pathogenicity, 
and  relative  importance  of  different  species  in  this 
group.  Research  emanating  primarily  from  European 
countries has suggested that some of the CNS species re-
covered from IMI are specifically adapted to the udder, 
whereas  other  species  are  environmental  opportunists 
that only sporadically cause infections (Taponen, 2008; 
Thorberg et al., 2009; Piessens et al., 2011). Accurate 
identification  of  CNS  is  paramount  in  order  for  the 
epidemiology of the different species to be elucidated 
and appropriate control strategies to be implemented in 
dairy herds where CNS mastitis is a problem (Sawant 
et al., 2009). Although the importance of species-level 
identification  of  CNS  is  recognized,  the  heterogeneity 
of the species within this group presents challenges in 
diagnostic  laboratories.  Biochemical  identification  of 
staphylococcal  isolates  is  labor  intensive  because  of 
the large number of tests required to differentiate the 
number of species within the genus (Vanderhaeghen et 
al.,  2015).  Furthermore,  commercial  phenotyping  sys-
tems have been found to have limited accuracy when 
identifying CNS of veterinary origin, presumably due to 
the limited number of veterinary isolates incorporated 
into the databases (Zadoks and Watts, 2009). Matrix-
assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass 
spectrometry  (MALDI-TOF  MS)  has  been  used 
successfully to identify mastitis pathogens (Barreiro et 
al., 2010; El Behiry et al., 2013); however, the capital 
costs of the instrumentation limit the use of MALDI-
TOF MS to specialized research facilities (Wieser et al., 
2012). Molecular methods, such as PCR and sequencing 
of housekeeping genes, have been shown to have higher 
discriminatory  power,  reproducibility,  and  typeability 
than  conventional  phenotyping  methods  and  are  now 
recommended  for  the  accurate  identification  of  CNS 
(Zadoks and Watts, 2009). Amplification and sequenc-
ing of the tuf gene, which encodes the elongation factor 
Tu, has been used successfully to differentiate CNS spe-
cies (Capurro et al., 2009).

Antimicrobials are commonly used for the treatment 
of cows with IMI or as a preventative measure during 
the dry-cow period (Sawant et al., 2009). Staphylococ-
cus aureus  is  intrinsically  susceptible  to  most  classes 

of  antimicrobials  but  has  the  extraordinary  potential 
to  develop,  or  acquire,  resistance  to  virtually  any 
antimicrobial  to  which  it  is  exposed  (Chambers  and 
DeLeo, 2009). Many of the genes encoding antimicro-
bial  resistance  determinants  reside  on  mobile  genetic 
elements,  which  can  be  exchanged  between  bacteria 
of  the  same  or  different  species  occupying  the  same 
ecological niche (Lindsay and Holden, 2006). This is of 
great clinical significance, as the transfer of resistance 
genes can lead to the emergence of more resistant and 
virulent bacterial strains (Lindsay and Holden, 2006). 
Although  less  pathogenic  than  Staph.  aureus,  CNS 
often  exhibit  greater  resistance  to  antimicrobials  and 
also  have  a  greater  tendency  to  develop  multidrug 
resistance (MDR) (Taponen and Pyörälä, 2009). The 
CNS are believed to serve as reservoirs of antimicrobial 
resistance genes, which can transfer and integrate into 
the genome of Staph. aureus (Otto, 2013; Vitali et al., 
2014).

Evaluating the antimicrobial susceptibility of staphy-
lococcal  isolates  recovered  from  IMI  is  important 
to  guide  therapeutic  treatment  of  infected  animals 
(Barkema et al., 2006). Moreover, monitoring the an-
timicrobial resistance of Staphylococcus spp. in animals 
is  important  from  a  public  health  perspective.  The 
proximity  of  humans  and  animals  in  the  dairy  envi-
ronment  presents  opportunities  for  the  transmission 
of bacteria between animal and human hosts (Juhász-
Kaszanyitzky  et  al.,  2007).  The  recent  description  of 
livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus 
(LA-MRSA; Graveland et al., 2011) and Staph. aure-
us strains harboring a novel methicillin-resistance gene, 
mecC (García-Álvarez et al., 2011), have renewed pub-
lic concerns regarding the role of animals, particularly 
livestock,  as  a  reservoir  and  source  of  antimicrobial-
resistant  bacteria,  which  can  infect  humans  (Fitzger-
ald, 2012). Both LA-MRSA and Staph. aureus strains 
harboring  the  mecC  gene  have  been  recovered  from 
bovine milk samples in several studies (Vanderhaeghen 
et al., 2010; García-Álvarez et al., 2011; Unnerstad et 
al., 2013). Inasmuch as the zoonotic transfer of bacteria 
is of concern from a human health perspective, the re-
verse scenario—the anthroponotic transfer of bacteria 
from humans to animals—warrants equal consideration 
(Fitzgerald, 2012). It is therefore important that bacte-
rial populations at the animal–human interface should 
be monitored.

Antimicrobial-resistant  Staph.  aureus,  particularly 
methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA), represent 
a significant public health burden in both hospital and 
community settings worldwide (Chambers and DeLeo, 
2009). The treatment options for infected patients are 
complicated by the fact that MRSA strains are MDR

because they carry other resistance genes on the cas-
sette  chromosome  harboring  the  mecA  gene  (Holmes 
and  Zadoks,  2011).  Resistance  to  frontline  antimicro-
bials  such  as  the  glycopeptide  vancomycin  has  been 
documented and the alarming lack of new antimicrobi-
als is a cause of great concern (Pantosti et al., 2007). 
Significant efforts are therefore aimed at conserving ex-
isting antimicrobials by promoting good antimicrobial 
stewardship in both human healthcare and veterinary 
medicine (Morley et al., 2005).

The purpose of this research was to investigate the 
diversity of Staphylococcus spp. responsible for IMI in 
South African dairy cows and to assess the susceptibil-
ity of the different species to antimicrobials commonly 
used  in  the  veterinary  field  as  well  as  antimicrobials 
relevant to human medicine. Concomitantly, individu-
als  working  in  close  contact  with  the  animals  were 
sampled and the diversity and susceptibility profiles of 
staphylococcal isolates determined and compared with 
staphylococcal species of animal origin.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample Collection and Processing

Ethical clearance for this investigation was obtained 
from  the  Animal  Ethics  Committee,  Faculty  of  Vet-
erinary Science, University of Pretoria (H010–13) and 
the University of Pretoria, Faculty of Health Sciences 
Research Ethics Committee (No.295/2013).

KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) is 1 of 9 provinces in the Re-
public of South Africa. Commercial dairy herds (n = 9; 
identified by the letters A, B, C, E, F, G, I, J, and L), 
communal animal herds (n = 2; collectively identified 
by the letter M), and agriculture college herds (n = 2; 
identified by the letters D and H) in KZN were recruited 
to participate in this study through private and state 
veterinarians in the province. Participation was volun-
tary. For commercial dairy herds, the sole criterion for 
inclusion in this study was a history of staphylococcal 
mastitis. Because of the limited number of agriculture 
college herds in the province and the limited accessibil-
ity to communal animals, no specific selection criteria 
could  be  implemented.  Herd  sizes  ranged  from  95  to 
1,450 (commercial herds), 40 to 50 (agriculture college 
herds), and 3 to 8 (communal herds). A single sampling 
was carried out at each site between October 2013 and 
March 2014.

Milk  samples  were  aseptically  collected  into  sterile 
sample tubes following cleaning and disinfection of the 
teat ends and stripping of the first 2 to 3 squirts of milk. 
At each of the sampling sites, close-contact workers in-
cluding animal owners, dairy laborers, and veterinary 

practitioners were approached and asked to participate 
in  the  study  by  providing  a  self-collected  nasal  swab 
(Copan,  Brescia,  Italy).  Following  collection,  all  milk 
samples and nasal swab specimens were packed on ice 
and transported to the laboratory.

All  milk  samples  were  visually  inspected  following 
receipt  in  the  laboratory.  Milk  samples  showing  any 
visual  evidence  of  abnormality,  such  as  the  presence 
of  clots,  flakes  or  blood,  were  classed  as  clinical.  No 
SCC  was  performed  on  clinical  samples.  All  milk 
samples  with  a  normal  appearance  were  analyzed  by 
flow cytometry using a Somacount instrument (Bentley 
Instruments, Chaska, MN), and the number of somatic 
cells per milliliter of sample was determined.

Microbiological Analysis of Milk Samples  
and Nasal Specimens

Ten microliters of each milk sample was inoculated 
onto  one  quadrant  of  a  Columbia  blood  agar  plate 
(Oxoid,  Basingstoke,  UK)  supplemented  with  5% 
ovine  blood.  Culture  plates  were  incubated  (NuAire, 
Plymouth, MN) at 37°C for 48 h. Nasal specimens were 
transferred to brain heart infusion broth (Oxoid) and 
incubated at 37°C overnight before being streaked onto 
Columbia  blood  agar  (Oxoid)  supplemented  with  5% 
ovine blood, BBL Columbia nalidixic acid agar (Bec-
ton  Dickinson,  Sparks,  MD),  and  oxacillin-resistance 
screening  agar  (Oxoid).  All  plates  were  incubated  at 
37°C for 48 h before being examined for the presence 
of  staphylococcal-like  colonies  (Quinn  et  al.,  1999). 
Preliminary testing of staphylococcal isolates included 
Gram staining and testing for catalase production. All 
catalase-positive,  gram-positive,  coccus-shaped  bacte-
rial isolates were tentatively identified as Staphylococ-
cus  spp.  and  tested  for  coagulase  production  using 
rabbit plasma (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and for clump-
ing  factor  using  a  commercial  latex  agglutination  kit 
(Pastorex StaphPlus kit, Bio-Rad (Quinn et al., 1999).
Only  staphylococcal  isolates  recovered  from  milk 
samples with an SCC ≥200,000 cells/mL were selected 
for further characterization. Additional selection crite-
ria for CNS included the occurrence of isolates in pure 
growth and the presence of 5 or more colonies (≥500 
cfu/mL of milk) on primary culture. When more than 
one type of CNS was isolated from different quarters of 
the same cow, based on phenotypic appearance, both 
isolates were retained for further testing. With respect 
to the staphylococcal isolates recovered from human na-
sal swabs, all Staph. aureus isolates were retained along 
with representative CNS colonies from each individual. 
All isolates were stored in 25% glycerol (Merck, Darm-
stadt, Germany) at −80°C (NuAire) until required.

Identification of Staphylococci and Screening  
for mecA and pvl Genes Using PCR

SCHMiDT eT AL.

One or two bacterial colonies were suspended in 50 µL 
of sterile deionized water. Bacterial DNA was extracted 
using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, 
Germany)  in  accordance  with  the  manufacturer’s  in-
structions.  All  staphylococcal  isolates  were  amplified 
using a multiplex PCR assay (multiplex 1) to confirm 
genus identification, to identify Staph. aureus isolates, 
and to simultaneously screen isolates for the methicillin 
resistance gene, mecA, and the Panton-Valentine leuko-
cidin encoding gene, pvl. Each PCR assay was carried 
out in a 25-µL volume comprising 1× PCR buffer (Pro-
mega, Madison, WI), 0.3 mM deoxynucleotide triphos-
phate mixture (Promega), 3 mM MgCl2 (Promega), 0.2 
µM of each primer, 1.5 U of HotStart GoTaq (Promega) 
and 2 µL of DNA extract. Reactions were cycled in a 
MJ Mini thermocycler (BioRad, Chaska, MN) with the 
following  parameters:  initial  denaturation  (95°C  for  2 
min) followed by 30 cycles of amplification (94°C for 45 
s, 51°C for 90 s, and 72°C for 90 s) and ending with a 
final extension step at 72°C for 10 min. A positive con-
trol and negative control (deionized water) was set up 
with every batch of PCR samples amplified. Details of 
all oligonucleotide primers and PCR controls are sum-
marized in Table 1. The PCR products were resolved in 
a 1.5% agarose gel (SeaKem, Lonza, Rockland, ME), in 
1× Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer (Melford, Ipswich, 
UK). Following staining in a 1 µg/mL ethidium bromide 
solution (BioRad), the PCR products were visualized 
and documented (UVIPro, Uvitec, Cambridge, UK).

Speciation of CNS Using PCR, MALDI-TOF MS,  
and tuf Gene Sequencing

Following  genus-specific  identification,  CNS  were 
identified  to  the  species  level  using  a  combination  of 
methods. All test isolates were amplified using 1 of 2 
multiplex PCR assays (multiplex 2 and 3) based on the 
origin  of  the  isolates.  Reactions  were  prepared  in  25-
µL volumes using the Qiagen Multiplex PCR kit and 
amplified according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
The PCR products were analyzed as described above 
with the exception that a 1.8% agarose gel (SeaKem, 
Lonza) was used to resolve the PCR amplicons.

With the exception of one bovine CNS isolate that 
failed  to  grow,  overnight  cultures  of  all  isolates  were 
preserved  in  chromatography-grade  ethanol  (Merck) 
and submitted for MALDI-TOF MS analysis (Bruker 
Daltonics GmbH, Bremen, Germany). Coagulase-nega-
tive staphylococcal isolates that could not be identified 
using the multiplex-PCR assay or MALDI-TOF MS or 

Journal of Dairy Science Vol. 98 No. 9, 2015

where discordant species identifications were obtained 
using  the  2  methods  were  analyzed  further  using  tuf 
gene  sequencing.  The  tuf  gene  was  amplified  accord-
ing to the method described by Heikens and coworkers 
(2005), and PCR amplicons were submitted to Inqaba 
Biotechnical Industries (Pretoria, South Africa) for se-
quencing. Consensus sequences were analyzed in Gen-
Bank and cut-off values for the percentage of identity 
were adjusted to ≥97% sequence similarity.

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing  
of Staphylococcal Isolates

The antimicrobial susceptibility of the staphylococcal 
test isolates to 15 antimicrobials was carried out using 
the agar disk-diffusion method according to the Clini-
cal and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, 2008). 
The antibiotics tested (Oxoid) included amoxicillin and 
clavulanate (20 µg/10 µg), ampicillin (10 µg), cefoxi-
tin  (30  µg),  ceftaroline  (30  µg),  cephalothin  (30  µg), 
clindamycin (2 µg), erythromycin (15 µg), gentamicin 
(10 µg), linezolid (30 µg), moxifloxacin (5 µg), penicil-
lin (10 U), streptomycin (10 µg), tetracycline (30 µg), 
and  trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole  (1.25/23.75  µg). 
The  clindamycin  and  erythromycin  disks  were  placed 
within 25 mm of each other on the agar surface to facil-
itate the detection of inducible clindamycin resistance 
or  the  “D-effect”  (Fiebelkorn  et  al.,  2003).  A  control 
isolate, Staph. aureus ATCC 25923, was tested together 
with  each  batch  of  field  isolates  to  ensure  the  valid-
ity of the test results. The zone measurements for all 
antimicrobials, with the exception of fusidic acid and 
streptomycin,  were  compared  with  CLSI  breakpoints 
based  on  data  derived  from  human  medicine  (CLSI, 
2008, 2014). In the case of fusidic acid, the breakpoint 
recommended  by  the  European  Committee  on  Anti-
microbial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST, 2014) was 
used and for streptomycin a breakpoint of ≥14 mm was 
used  as  described  by  Kim  and  coworkers  (2004)  and 
Shittu and Lin (2006). The production of β-lactamase 
by  Staph.  aureus  isolates  was  determined  by  examin-
ing the edge of the zone of inhibition surrounding the 
penicillin disk. Isolates showing abrupt, heaped edges 
were recorded as being resistant to penicillin, irrespec-
tive of the zone diameter (CLSI, 2014). Beta-lactamase 
production  by  CNS  isolates  was  determined  using 
nitrocefin-impregnated  sticks  (Oxoid)  in  accordance 
with the manufacturer’s instructions.

Resistance categories were defined based on recom-
mendations  made  by  Schwarz  and  coworkers  (2010). 
Briefly,  isolates  showing  susceptibility  to  all  classes 
of  antimicrobials  tested  were  termed  pansusceptible; 
isolates  showing  resistance  to  1  or  2  classes  or  anti-

microbials were termed resistant; and isolates showing 
resistance to 3 or more classes of antimicrobials were 
termed MDR.

PCR Screening of Staphylococcal Isolates  
for Antimicrobial Resistance Determinants

Staphylococcal  isolates  were  screened  for  a  com-
bination  of  7  antimicrobial  resistance  genes  using  2 
multiplex  PCR  assays.  Reactions  were  prepared  in 
25-µL  volumes  using  the  Qiagen  Multiplex  PCR  kit 
and included primers specific for the blaZ, mecC, vanA, 
and vanB (multiplex 4) and tetK, tetM, and aacA-aphD 
(multiplex  5)  genes.  Amplification  of  PCR  reactions 
was carried out in a MJ Mini thermocycler (BioRad) 
using  the  thermocycling  conditions  recommended  by 
the kit manufacturer. Electrophoresis was carried out 
as described above.

RESULTS

Microbiological Analysis

A total of 3,387 milk samples from 1,374 cows and 
79 human nasal swab specimens were collected from 13 
dairy herds. One hundred forty-six Staph. aureus and 
102 CNS isolates cultured from the milk samples ful-
filled the selection criteria and were retained for further 
analysis. Staphylococcus aureus was recovered from 12 
(15.2%) of the human nasal swabs. All 12 Staph. aureus 
isolates  and  the  95  CNS  isolates  recovered  from  the 
nasal swabs were retained for analysis.

Identification of Staphylococci and Screening  
for mecA and pvl Genes by PCR

All  of  the  analyzed  staphylococcal  isolates  were 
genotypically  identified  as  Staphylococcus  spp.  using 
the first multiplex PCR assay. Furthermore, all of the 
isolates phenotypically identified as Staph. aureus were 
confirmed to be Staph. aureus using the same multiplex 
PCR  assay.  None  of  the  bovine  or  human  staphylo-
coccal  isolates  was  positive  for  the  Panton-Valentine 
leucocidin-encoding  gene,  pvl.  Fifteen  CNS  of  human 
origin tested positive for the mecA gene.

Speciation of CNS Using PCR, MALDI-TOF MS,  
and tuf Gene Sequencing

A combination of 2 multiplex PCR assays and MAL-
DI-TOF MS was used to identify the 102 CNS isolates 
of bovine origin and 95 CNS isolates of human origin. 
Five bovine isolates originating from 2 farms were not 

identified  using  either  the  multiplex  PCR  assay  or 
MALDI-TOF MS and were analyzed further using tuf 
gene  sequencing.  The  consensus  tuf  DNA  sequences 
of  the  5  isolates  showed  99  to100%  agreement  with 
sequences  already  deposited  in  GenBank  (accession 
no.  EU571021.1).  The  sequences  corresponded  to  an 
unidentified Staphylococcus species recovered from bo-
vine mastitis cases deposited by Capurro and coworkers 
(2009).

A  further  9  CNS  were  analyzed  using  tuf  gene  se-
quencing to confirm the species identification obtained 
using MALDI-TOF MS. The percentage distribution of 
CNS species isolated from both the milk samples and 
human specimens is presented in Table 2. Seven differ-
ent Staphylococcus spp. were identified among the CNS 
isolates of bovine origin, with the majority of the isolates 
being identified as Staph. chromogenes (78.4%). Other 
species identified included Staph. xylosus (4.9%), Staph. 
hyicus  (3.9%),  Staph.  simulans  (3.9%),  Staph. haemo-
lyticus  (1.9%),  Staph.  lugdunensis  (0.9%),  and  Staph. 
epidermidis (0.9%). Nine species were identified among 
the  CNS  recovered  from  the  human  specimens,  with 
Staph. epidermidis  (80%),  Staph. chromogenes  (6.3%), 
and Staph. haemolyticus (5.3%) predominating.

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing  
of Staphylococcal Isolates

All  staphylococcal  isolates  were  evaluated  for  sus-
ceptibility to antimicrobials used for the treatment of 
bovine IMI as well as antimicrobials relevant to human 
medicine.  The  antimicrobial  susceptibility  profiles  of 
the Staph. aureus isolates of bovine and human origin 
are summarized in Table 3. Isolates showing intermedi-
ate  susceptibility  were  grouped  together  with  isolates 
showing resistance to the antimicrobial evaluated.

The  Staph.  aureus  isolates  of  bovine  origin  were 
divided into 8 antibiotypes based on their susceptibil-
ity  patterns  to  the  different  classes  of  antimicrobials 
evaluated. Ninety-eight (67.1%) Staph. aureus isolates 
of bovine origin were susceptible to all of the antimi-
crobial classes evaluated (pansusceptible). Thirty-nine 
(26.7%)  isolates  were  resistant  to  a  single  class  of 
antimicrobials,  whereas  7  (4.8%)  were  resistant  to  2 
classes. Two (1.4%) Staph. aureus isolates, from differ-
ent  herds,  exhibited  MDR.  One  of  these  isolates  was 
resistant to the β-lactams penicillin and ampicillin, as 
well as tetracycline and potentiated sulfonamides. The 
second MDR isolate showed resistance to penicillin and 
ampicillin, tetracycline, and streptomycin. The Staph. 
aureus isolates of human origin were divided into 4 an-
tibiotypes. Three (25%) of the 12 Staph. aureus isolates 
were  pansusceptible;  4  Staph.  aureus  isolates  (33.3%)

were  resistant  to  a  single  class  of  antimicrobials;  and 
a further 4 isolates (33.3%) were resistant to 2 classes 
of  antimicrobials.  A  single  Staph.  aureus  isolate  was 
found to be MDR, showing resistance to penicillin and 
ampicillin, as well as tetracycline and the potentiated 
sulfonamides.  None  of  the  Staph.  aureus  isolates  of 
bovine or human origin showed resistance to cefoxitin 
(surrogate for methicillin and other penicillinase-resis-
tant β-lactams), ceftaroline, cephalothin, clindamycin, 
erythromycin,  fusidic  acid,  gentamicin,  linezolid,  or 
moxifloxacin.

The antimicrobial susceptibility of the different CNS 
species of bovine and human origin are summarized in 
Tables 2 and 4. Phenotypic resistance to penicillin and 
ampicillin  was  observed  in  37.3%  of  the  bovine  CNS 
isolates and 89.5% of the human CNS isolates. Among 
the 102 bovine CNS isolates evaluated, only 2 Staph. 
chromogenes (1.9%) isolates showed MDR. None of the 
bovine  CNS  isolates  showed  phenotypic  resistance  to 
cefoxitin, cephalothin, clindamycin, erythromycin, gen-
tamicin, linezolid, or moxifloxacin. By comparison, 37 
(39%) of the human CNS isolates were MDR. The resis-
tance profiles of the MDR isolates are detailed in Table 
4.  None  of  the  CNS  isolates  of  human  origin  showed 
phenotypic resistance to cephalothin or linezolid. The 
15 human CNS isolates, which tested positive for the 
presence  of  the  mecA  gene  using  the  first  multiplex 
PCR assay and were subsequently identified as Staph. 
epidermidis (n = 12) and Staph. haemolyticus (n = 5), 
were found to be phenotypically resistant to cefoxitin.

PCR Screening of Staphylococcal Isolates  
for Antimicrobial Resistance Determinants

The blaZ gene was detected in 172 of the 355 (48.5%) 
staphylococcal isolates examined. All 172 isolates were 
found to be resistant to penicillin when tested pheno-
typically. Two isolates, 1 Staph. sciuri (human origin) 
and  1  Staph.  chromogenes  (bovine  origin),  that  were 
found  to  be  phenotypically  resistant  to  penicillin  did 
not test positive for the blaZ gene using the multiplex 
PCR assay. None of the staphylococcal isolates tested 
positive  for  the  presence  of  the  tetM  gene.  The  tetK 
gene  was  detected  in  76  of  79  (96.2%)  isolates  that 
were phenotypically resistant to tetracycline. Three of 
the  staphylococcal  isolates  that  were  phenotypically 
resistant to tetracycline did not carry either the tetK or 
tetM gene. Nine isolates of human origin (4 Staph. epi-
dermidis, 5 Staph. haemolyticus) tested positive for the 
presence of the aminoglycoside resistance determinant 
aacA-aphD. None of the bovine isolates were found to 
be  carrying  this  specific  gene.  None  of  the  staphylo-
coccal isolates were positive for the mecC gene or the 
vancomycin resistance determinants vanA and vanB.

DISCUSSION

Staphylococci  are  a  common  cause  of  bovine  IMI 
worldwide, including South Africa (Petzer et al., 2009). 
This study was not designed to carry out a prevalence 
study but rather to facilitate the collection of a represen-
tative number of staphylococcal isolates from different 
dairy  operations  in  KZN  for  further  characterization. 
Consequently, the selection of participating commercial 
dairy herds was based on the criterion that each of the 
herds  had  a  history  of  IMI  caused  by  Staphylococcus 
spp.

A combination of methods was used to identify the 
CNS  isolates  of  bovine  and  human  origin.  This  ap-
proach was used to improve the accuracy of bacterial 
identification  at  the  species  level.  The  predominant 
CNS species recovered from the milk samples analyzed 
in this study was Staph. chromogenes, which accounted 
for 78.4% of the isolates examined. The proportion of 
different Staphylococcus species recovered from bovine 
IMI has varied between studies carried out in different 
countries.  In  general,  Staph. chromogenes,  Staph. hae-
molyticus,  Staph.  epidermidis,  Staph.  simulans,  and 
Staph. xylosus are usually among the most commonly 
isolated species (Vanderhaeghen et al., 2015). In Swe-
den, Persson-Waller and coworkers (2011) found Staph. 
chromogenes (24%) and Staph. epidermidis (22%) to be 
the most common CNS species identified among a col-
lection  of  isolates  assembled  from  2  national  mastitis 
surveys. A study in Switzerland reported Staph. xylosus 
(36.0%) and Staph. chromogenes (16.8%) to be among 
the  most  common  CNS  causing  mastitis  (Frey  et  al., 
2013). In the United States, Park and coworkers (2011) 
identified 11 CNS species from cases of mastitis, with 
Staph.  chromogenes  (72.2%),  Staph.  xylosus  (9.1%), 
and  Staph.  haemolyticus  (6.1%)  being  the  most  com-
mon species identified. It has been suggested that the 
distribution of CNS species causing IMI is herd-specific 
and may be influenced by specific management prac-
tices that may vary between countries (Thorberg et al., 
2009; Supré et al., 2011). Species-level epidemiological 
studies conducted in European dairy herds have shown 
that Staph. chromogenes is a more specific udder patho-
gen than the other CNS and tends to cause persistent 
IMI  (Supré  et  al.,  2011).  Staphylococcus  chromogenes 
was also found to have a significant effect on the SCC 
of infected quarters, comparable to counts induced by 
Staph. aureus infections (Supré et al., 2011).

Five  of  the  CNS  isolates  remained  unidentified  fol-
lowing PCR, MALDI-TOF MS, and sequencing of the 
tuf  gene.  All  5  of  the  isolates  had  the  same  tuf  gene 
sequence  and  in  all  likelihood  are  the  same  species. 
The  tuf  gene  sequence  showed  99  to  100%  similarity 
with sequence data deposited by Capurro and cowork-

ers  (2009),  which  interestingly  belonged  to  an  isolate 
recovered  from  mastitic  milk  samples  in  Finland.  In 
recent  years,  several  new  Staphylococcus  species  have 
been described. Supré and coworkers (2010) described 
a novel Staphylococcus species, Staph. devriesei, which 
had  been  isolated  from  bovine  teat  apices  as  well  as 
milk  from  study  herds  in  Belgium  and  the  Nether-
lands. Taponen and coworkers (2012) published details 
describing  a  new,  previously  unidentified  Staphylococ-
cus  species,  named  Staph. agnetis.  Isolates  represent-
ing  this  newly  described  species  were  recovered  from 
bovine  milk  samples  (Taponen  et  al.,  2012).  Further 
genotyping  studies  will  be  undertaken  to  identify  the 
unidentified  Staphylococcus  spp.  recovered  from  the 
milk samples analyzed in the current study.

The  predominant  CNS  recovered  from  the  human 
nasal swab samples was Staph. epidermidis. This is not 
surprising as Staph. epidermidis is a known commensal 
forming part of the natural microflora on human skin 
(Thorberg et al., 2006). Molecular typing studies con-
ducted  by  Thorberg  and  coworkers  (2006)  in  Sweden 
showed that Staph. epidermidis isolates recovered from 
cases of mastitis were genotypically identical to those 
recovered from the skin of milkers. This observation led 
them to suggest that Staph. epidermidis is a zoonotic 
organism. In contrast to the high prevalence of Staph. 
epidermidis in the human swab samples analyzed in the 
current study, only one of the bovine isolates tested was 
identified as Staph. epidermidis. This may indicate that 
Staph. epidermidis is not a significant causative agent 
of IMI in our study area.

Overall, 15.2% of the humans sampled in this study 
were found to harbor Staph. aureus. It is reported that 
approximately  20%  of  healthy  human  individuals  are 
persistent carriers of Staph. aureus, 30% are intermit-
tent carriers, and 50% of individuals are never colonized 
by  Staph. aureus  (Kluytmans  and  Struelans,  2009; 
Graveland et al., 2011). Nasal carriage of Staph. aureus 
is  recognized  as  a  risk  factor  for  acquiring  infections 
and  additionally  plays  a  role  in  the  dissemination  of 
Staph. aureus in hospitals and the community (Zriouil 
et al., 2012).

The β-lactam antibiotics penicillin and ampicillin are 
used  extensively  for  the  prevention  and  treatment  of 
IMI in dairy cows (IVS, 2015). In South Africa, more 
than half of the intramammary preparations available 
for use comprise penicillin or ampicillin with or without 
dihydrostreptomycin  (IVS,  2015).  Furthermore,  many 
of  the  preparations  are  available  to  farmers  over  the 
counter, making it difficult to monitor and control an-
timicrobial usage. In our study, resistance to penicillin 
was the most commonly detected resistance, with 28.8% 
of  Staph.  aureus  and  37.3%  of  CNS  isolates  showing 
phenotypic resistance to penicillin. This scenario paral-

lels reports from other countries. Pyörälä and coworkers 
(2011) indicated that generally between one-third and 
two-thirds of bovine Staph. aureus isolates are resistant 
to penicillin, with lower percentages being reported in 
countries where strict antimicrobial policies have been 
implemented. Differences in the levels of bacterial re-
sistance documented between studies are influenced by 
sampling strategies and bacterial populations but also 
by differences in test methodology and the use of dif-
ferent interpretation criteria (Barkema et al., 2006). It 
is therefore suggested that comparisons between stud-
ies  be  restricted  to  studies  that  have  used  the  same 
methodology  and  interpretation  criteria  (Schwarz  et 
al., 2010).

It is of great significance, from both an animal and 
a public health perspective, that none of the staphylo-
coccal isolates of bovine origin exhibited resistance to 
cefoxitin, the in vitro surrogate for examining the phe-
notypic susceptibility of isolates to methicillin (CLSI, 
2014).  Several  studies  have  reported  on  the  presence 
of  methicillin-resistant  staphylococci  in  milk  samples, 
raising  concerns  over  milk  as  a  source  of  methicillin-
resistant  bacteria.  In  Switzerland,  47%  of  the  CNS 
isolates  evaluated  in  vitro  were  found  to  be  resistant 
to oxacillin (Frey et al., 2013). Vanderhaeghen and co-
workers (2010) found that almost 10% of herds sampled 
in Belgium to have cases of mastitis caused by MRSA. 
The  in-herd  prevalence  of  MRSA  varied  between  0 
and 7.4%. Furthermore, all strains had characteristics 
typical of the zoonotic LA-MRSA strains belonging to 
clonal complex (CC) 398.

In South Africa, antimicrobial susceptibility data are 
sparse. Three studies have reported on the occurrence 
of  MRSA  from  cases  of  bovine  mastitis  with  preva-
lence rates varying between 1.1 and 93.2% (Petzer et 
al., 2007; Ateba et al., 2010; Schmidt, 2011). The high 
prevalence of 93.2% noted in one study is largely attrib-
utable to the sampling approach and the small sample 
size (Ateba et al., 2010). None of the studies confirmed 
the presence of the mecA gene in the isolates exhibit-
ing phenotypic resistance. Generally, it is accepted that 
screening for mecA is the most reliable method for the 
detection  of  methicillin  resistance  in  staphylococcal 
isolates.  Performing  only  phenotypic  tests  has  previ-
ously  led  to  the  reporting  of  both  false-positive  and 
false-negative results (Vanderhaeghen et al., 2010).

Phenotypic  resistance  to  antimicrobials  other  than 
penicillin  and  ampicillin  was  not  common  among  the 
bovine staphylococcal isolates evaluated in our study. A 
low percentage of Staph. aureus (8.2%) and CNS (4.9%) 
isolates exhibited phenotypic resistance to streptomy-
cin.  Resistance  to  tetracycline  was  also  noted,  with 
2.7% of the Staph. aureus and 8.8% of the CNS isolates 
showing  phenotypic  resistance  to  this  antimicrobial.

The observed resistance coincides with the availability 
of both of these antimicrobials in intramammary prepa-
rations in South Africa (IVS, 2015). None of the bovine 
Staph.  aureus  or  CNS  isolates  exhibited  resistance  to 
cephalothin,  clindamycin,  erythromycin,  linezolid,  or 
moxifloxacin, and only 2 isolates, 1 Staph. hyicus and 
1 Staph. xylosus, were found to be phenotypically resis-
tant to fusidic acid. The aforementioned antimicrobials 
have  limited  application  in  veterinary  medicine  but 
are used in human medicine to treat different types of 
staphylococcal infections (Lowy, 2013).

Multidrug resistance was more common among the 
CNS than the Staph. aureus isolates and more common 
among human isolates than bovine isolates. In total, 37 
(39%) of the CNS isolates of human origin were MDR, 
whereas  only  2  Staph.  chromogenes  isolates  of  bovine 
origin were MDR. Two Staph. aureus isolates of bovine 
origin were MDR, whereas only a single Staph. aureus 
isolate  from  the  human  nasal  swabs  was  found  to  be 
MDR.  Interestingly,  the  human  MDR  Staph.  aureus 
was isolated from a farm laborer on the same farm as 
the  MDR  bovine  Staph.  aureus  isolate  and  displayed 
the  same  antimicrobial  susceptibility  profile.  Future 
genotyping studies will be undertaken to determine the 
genetic  relatedness  of  the  bovine  and  human  isolates 
and investigate possible bacterial transmission between 
hosts.

Antimicrobial  susceptibility  testing  of  isolates  was 
supplemented  by  screening  for  specific  antimicrobial 
resistance  genes.  None  of  the  staphylococcal  isolates 
evaluated  were  shown  to  carry  the  vanA  and  vanB 
genes, which confer vancomycin resistance to isolates. 
Considering the importance and reliance on vancomy-
cin  for  the  treatment  of  MRSA  infections  in  human 
medicine, the lack of vancomycin resistance markers in 
both the bovine and human staphylococci analyzed in 
our study is therefore positive.

The correlation between the phenotypic susceptibil-
ity of isolates to penicillin with the presence of the blaZ 
gene was not absolute. A Staph. sciuri isolate of human 
origin and a Staph. chromogenes isolate of bovine origin 
were found to be phenotypically resistant to penicillin 
but negative for the presence of the blaZ gene. A possible 
explanation for this discrepancy could be a mutation of 
the primer-annealing site that prevented amplification. 
All staphylococcal test isolates were also screened for 
the presence of 2 tetracycline resistance determinants: 
tetK  and  tetM.  The  tetK  gene  was  detected  in  the 
majority of the isolates showing phenotypic resistance 
to tetracycline, whereas tetM was not detected. Three 
isolates, 2 Staph. chromogenes and 1 Staph. haemolyti-
cus, that were phenotypically resistant to tetracycline 
tested negative for the presence of both tetK and tetM. 
This discrepancy could be due to the presence of other 

Journal of Dairy Science Vol. 98 No. 9, 2015

tetracyclin-resistance  encoding  genes,  such  as  tetL  or 
tetO, or due to a mutation in the primer-annealing site. 
The  discrepancies  observed  between  the  phenotypic 
susceptibility of our test isolates and PCR screening for 
resistance genes highlight some of the shortcomings as-
sociated with the molecular detection of antimicrobial 
resistance. In many cases, antimicrobial resistance can 
be mediated by several different genes and mechanisms, 
some of which are still undescribed (Fluit et al., 2001).
One  of  the  specific  limitations  associated  with  the 
determination  of  the  antimicrobial  susceptibility  of 
veterinary bacterial isolates is the fact that there are 
currently very few antimicrobial breakpoints validated 
specifically  for  use  with  isolates  of  veterinary  origin 
(Schwarz  et  al.,  2010).  At  present,  interpretive  data 
are only available for the testing of mastitis pathogens 
against ceftiofur, penicillin-novobiocin, and pirlimycin 
(CLSI, 2008). The latter antimicrobial is currently not 
registered for use in South Africa (IVS, 2015). Because 
of the lack of data, it is common practice to make use of 
breakpoints derived from human medicine to interpret 
in vitro data. This is not ideal and should be considered 
when interpreting results.

CONCLUSIONS

This  study  provides  insight  into  the  diversity  of 
Staphylococcus  spp.  causing  IMI  in  cows  in  South 
African dairy herds and communal animals. The pre-
dominance of S. chromogenes among the CNS isolates 
warrants further investigation to elucidate the epidemi-
ology and virulence characteristics of strains circulat-
ing within herds. This study further demonstrated that 
antimicrobial  resistance  among  Staphylococcus  spp. 
causing  IMI  was  generally  low.  These  results  suggest 
the responsible usage of antimicrobials on dairy farms 
or the existence of management practices that do not 
favor  the  accumulation  of  resistance  genes,  or  both. 
Because of the propensity of staphylococci to acquire 
antimicrobial resistance through the genetic exchange 
of  DNA  with  compatible  strains  occupying  the  same 
microbiological niche, continued monitoring of bacterial 
populations is necessary.
