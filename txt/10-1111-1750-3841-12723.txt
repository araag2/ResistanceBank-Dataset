Abstract: This study investigated the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in raw meat and
ﬁsh and foods prepared from them for patient consumption in public hospitals in Salvador, Bahia, in northeastern Brazil.
A total of 114 samples of raw meat and ﬁsh (chicken, n = 30; beef, n = 30; pork, n = 24; and ﬁsh, n = 30) and
63 samples of prepared foods (made with chicken, n = 15; beef, n = 15; pork, n = 15; and ﬁsh, n = 18) were collected
from the kitchens of 10 different hospitals. Of the 114 investigated raw meat and ﬁsh samples, 28.1% were positive
for MRSA, which comprised 23.3% beef, 23.3% chicken, 37.5% pork, and 30% ﬁsh samples. Of the prepared foods,
9.5% were positive for MRSA, which comprised 5.6% chicken products, 6.7% pork products, and 22.2% ﬁsh products.
MRSA contamination was not detected in prepared beef dishes. A statistical analysis showed no association between the
presence of MRSA and the type of raw food (P > 0.05). The high prevalence of MRSA among the raw foods tested
and the presence of the microorganism in prepared foods emphasizes the necessity of enforcing hygienic practices within
hospital kitchens.

Keywords: antimicrobial resistance, hospitals’ kitchens, MRSA, prepared foods, raw meat

Practical Application: We assessed the presence of MRSA in raw and ready-to-eat meat and ﬁsh products in public
hospitals. The results of this work may be used to alert the veterinaries and health authorities that the pathogen has
entered the food chain.

Introduction

Staphylococcus aureus, a pathogen involved in severe gastrointesti-
nal disorders, is the most common etiological agent of bovine
mastitis (Perillo and others 2012). The microorganism is asso-
ciated with nosocomial and community-acquired staphylococcal
infections, primarily related to the emergence of drug-resistant
organisms (DeLeo and Chambers 2009).

Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains were 1st identi-
ﬁed in 1961, immediately after the introduction of methicillin in
clinical settings (Barber 1961). Since then, increased resistance to
methicillin among S. aureus isolates has been observed globally
(Chambers 1997). Approximately 30 to 50 kb of additional chro-
mosomal DNA, mec, which is not found in susceptible strains of
staphylococci, is present in methicillin-resistant strains. The mec
cassette contains mecA, the structural gene for penicillin binding
protein 2a (PBP2a). PBP2a interferes with β-lactam antibiotics by
preventing their effective binding to cell wall proteins (Chambers
1997; Kamal and others 2013).

Livestock-associated MRSA strains have been identiﬁed in
Europe and the 1st colonization was reported in the Netherlands
(Voss and others 2005), where pigs were thought to be a source of

MRSA infection in humans (Morcillo and others 2012). Antibi-
otics used to promote animal growth are generally administered
orally, at low doses, and for extended duration. These 3 conditions
can induce resistance in pathogenic bacteria and have the potential
to generate residues in animal tissue and meat products (Lipsitch
and others 2002). Thus, these treatments are controversial and have
been criticized by health authorities and consumer advocates in
Brazil and other countries.

Because S. aureus is highly prevalent in food and food envi-
ronments, MRSA may follow the same transmission pattern, and
although MRSA infections have not been associated with con-
sumption of contaminated meats, the pathogen has entered the
food chain. Recent studies conﬁrmed MRSA detection with
varying incidence in meat, including beef, pork, chicken, ﬁsh,
and another animals (Huijsdens and others 2006; Normanno and
others 2007; Van Loo and others 2007; De Boer and others 2009;
Lozano and others 2009).

Strategies to control and prevent the spread of MRSA in the
hospitals include the early identiﬁcation of positive patients, pa-
tient isolation, skin and nasal decontamination, hand hygiene, and
decontamination of clinical areas (Sexton and others 2006).

Because the complete eradication of MRSA may be impossi-
ble, the control of transmission seems to be an appropriate goal.
The identiﬁcation of MRSA sources, such as food, is essential
for monitoring and preventing infections. In addition, interest in
hospital-associated MRSA infections and in community-acquired
MRSA infections has been increasing in recent years (Gelatti and
others 2009). Thus, meals prepared in hospitals should receive
special attention because this food is intended for consumption by

MRSA in foods from hospitals’ kitchens . . .

patients, a population at high risk for acquiring various diseases.
This study investigated the presence of MRSA in raw ingredients
and prepared foods destined for patient meals in public hospitals
in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.

Materials and Methods
Detection of MRSA in raw meat

Sampling and laboratory procedures. A total of 114 sam-
ples of raw meat were collected in 10 of the 14 public hospitals in
the city of Salvador, Bahia, in northeastern Brazil, from July 2011
to May 2012. The samples were from different lots and were col-
lected during 3 different visits to each hospital, which comprised
one raw meat type in each hospital during each visit. In total,
30 samples of beef, 30 samples of chicken, 24 samples of pork,
and 30 samples of ﬁsh were collected. Pork was not processed in
hospitals B and C.

For the detection of MRSA, approximately 250 g of food was
aseptically collected in the hospitals’ kitchens and transported to
the laboratory for analysis. Approximately 25 g of food was added
to 225 mL of Mueller–Hinton broth (MHB) supplemented with
6.5% NaCl and homogenized in a Stomacher (240 bpm; ITR
model 1204, series 126, S˜ao Paulo, SP, Brazil) for 2 min in a class
II biosafety cabinet (Labconco Corp., Labconco Puriﬁer Class IIb,
Total Exhaust, model 36210-04, certiﬁed ISO 9002, Kansas City,
Mo., U.S.A.). This homogenate was then incubated at 37 °C for
16 to 20 h. Next, a 1-mL aliquot was added to 9 mL of phenol red
mannitol broth containing ceftizoxime (5 μg/mL) and aztreonam
(75 μg/mL; PHMB; Sigma-Aldrich Brazil Ltda, S˜ao Paulo, SP,
Brazil), followed by direct plating on the surface of MRSA-ID
medium (BioM´erieux Brazil S/A, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; De
Boer and others 2009). From the culture obtained in PHMB,
the surface of the selective MRSA-ID medium was inoculated
with a sterile loop. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C,
and if the colonies were difﬁcult to identify, the incubation was
extended for another 24 h. The plates were examined for typical
green colonies. For conﬁrmation, a maximum of 5 selected typical
colonies per plate were subcultured on trypticase soy agar (TSA,
DIFCO, Detroit, MI, USA).

Detection of PBP2a test. The SlidexR MRSA Detection
(Biomerieux, Brazil S/A, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil), which is
based on the agglutination of latex particles coated with mono-
clonal antibodies against PBP2a, was performed and interpreted
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. One S. aureus (ATCC
25923) negative control and one MRSA (ATCC 33591) positive
control were used for each set of analyzed samples.

Detection of MRSA in prepared foods

The hospital kitchens that harbored MRSA in the samples of
raw meat were investigated for the presence of MRSA in prepared
foods. A total of 63 samples of foods prepared with chicken
(n = 15, for example, roasted chicken; chicken stew; grilled
chicken; Cuban style chicken; chicken Silveirinha (chicken pieces
with carrots and seasoning); stroganoff (chicken breast cooked in
sauce containing evaporated milk, champignon mushrooms, and
seasonings), and seasoned chicken strips (chicken ﬁngers)), beef
(n = 15, for example, seasoned beef strips; beef stew [beef stew
cooked with sauce, corn, and seasonings]; roasted beef; steak;
steak wrapped in carrots, bacon, and seasonings; fried breaded
steak; and beef stew with vegetables [small pieces of beef cooked
with vegetables]), pork (n = 15, for example, pork hind legs
with mint [pork leg cooked in mint sauce]; sweet and sour sauce

M2 Journal of Food Science r Vol. 00, Nr. 0, 2014

pork hind legs; grilled brined pork [ribs]; pork shank in sauce;
roasted pork shank; roasted and shredded pork shank; pork shank
with Brazilian vinaigrette sauce; pork hind legs in wine; and
lemon-grilled brined pork), and ﬁsh (n = 18, for example, ﬁsh
stew [ﬁsh, coconut milk, tomato, and seasoning]; Escabeche of
ﬁsh [regional food made with ﬁsh ﬁllet, coconut milk, potatoes
and seasoning]; Merluza [Merluccius] grilled ﬁsh ﬁllet; Tilapia
[Oreochromis niloticus] ﬁsh ﬁllet in sauce; Gomes de S´a style ﬁsh;
ﬁsh mixture; Br´az style ﬁsh; and Merluza ﬁsh ﬁllet in sauce) were
collected and subjected to the same analysis described in section.
The ﬁsh investigated were grown in aquaculture systems and
were purchased in frozen ﬁllet (86.7%) form. All dishes were
cooked in the oven (180 to 220 °C) or on the stove (87 to
99.5 °C) and distributed to patients after 30 to 60 min.

Data analysis

We used simple logistic regression analyses and 2 tests of as-
sociation, Pearson’s chi-square (χ 2) and Fisher’s tests (SPSS 17.0
for Windows), to determine whether there were signiﬁcant dif-
ferences (P < 0.05) in MRSA contamination between the inves-
tigated raw meats.

Results

A total of 451 isolates were obtained from the 114 samples of

raw meat, and 98 were identiﬁed as positive for MRSA.

The results of the prevalence testing for the raw meat are sum-
marized in Table 1. MRSA strains were isolated from 32 (28.1%)
of the 114 samples of raw meat. All of the investigated hospitals’
kitchens contained at least one type of raw meat or ﬁsh contam-
inated by MRSA. The lowest prevalence was found in hospital
G, which had only one sample of contaminated ﬁsh. The high-
est prevalence was observed in hospitals E and I, with 5 (41.7%)
positive samples each. Considering each food separately, the per-
centages of MRSA-positive samples of beef, chicken, pork, and
ﬁsh were 23.3% (7/30), 23.3% (7/30), 37.5% (9/24), and 30.0%
(9/30), respectively.

From 63 samples of prepared foods, 92 isolates were obtained,
and 13 were positive for MRSA. In total, 9.5% of the samples tested
positive for MRSA, with the following breakdown by meat: dishes
made with chicken, 5.6%; pork, 6.7%; and ﬁsh, 22.2%. The dishes
made with beef were not contaminated by MRSA (Table 2). The
speciﬁc dishes contaminated by MRSA were pork hind legs with
mint, Tilapia ﬁsh ﬁllet in sauce, ﬁsh mixture, stroganoff, Merluza
grilled ﬁsh ﬁllet, and Tilapia ﬁsh ﬁllet in sauce.

Although the pork samples presented the highest prevalence of
MRSA, the study showed no association between MRSA con-
tamination and the type of raw meat investigated (P = 0.619).
A logistic regression analysis model was used with the pathogen
as the response variable and raw meat as the independent variable.
The model indicates that the probability for raw ﬁsh to be con-
taminated with MRSA was 1.40-fold higher than for raw beef,
and pork was 1.97 times more likely to be contaminated than beef
(data not shown).

Discussion

Results from this study indicated high prevalence of MRSA
in raw meats tested as compared to recent ﬁndings by De Boer
and other (2009), Normanno and other (2007), and Van Loo and
others (2007).

The frequency of the MRSA contamination of foods is expected
to be low, and there is often a great variety of background ﬂora;
thus, direct isolation on selective plating media is rarely successful

(De Boer and others 2009). According to Nahimana and others
(2006), the use of an enrichment broth, as in this study, increases
the detection rate of MRSA in samples.

Our results demonstrated no correlation between speciﬁc types
of raw meat and the prevalence of MRSA. These results are in
agreement with the ﬁndings reported by De Boer and others
(2009).

Although recent studies of MRSA in animals in the Netherlands
have focused on pigs, the results of the present and other recent
studies (Huijsdens and others 2006; Normanno and others 2007;
Walther and others 2008; Hammad and others 2012; Alzohairy
2011; Crago and others 2012; Shahraz and others 2012) show
that other food-producing animals are also important reservoirs of
MRSA.

Contamination of the raw meats and ﬁsh could be traced
back to abattoirs and aquaculture systems, respectively, due cross-
contamination of the meat at some point during processing. Also,
antibiotics used to promote animal growth can induce resistance
in bacteria and have the potential to generate residues in animal
tissue and meat products (Lipsitch and others 2002). This ﬁnding
demonstrates the importance of selecting suppliers of meat prod-
ucts and of warning these suppliers about the indiscriminate use
of antibiotics in animal health.

Unfortunately, we did not successfully investigate the use of
antibiotics in animal husbandry. Thus, further studies are necessary
to clarify differences in the MRSA contamination of meats from
various countries or regions and the potential relationship with
the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry.

In the preparede food, the presence of MRSA indicates that
cross-contamination occurred after cooking by an asymptomatic
food handler or by utensils used in the distribution of the meals

because the thermal processing was sufﬁcient to kill the microor-
ganism.

Dishes prepared with ﬁsh presented a higher frequency of con-
tamination by MRSA in this study. The cage-cultured tilapia
(Oreochromis niloticus) investigated were purchased in frozen ﬁl-
let (86.7%) form. All of the ﬁsh samples contaminated by MRSA
were ﬁsh ﬁllets.

Certainly, many factors are responsible for variations in preva-
lence of MRSA, and mostly, the neglected hygienic practices
were the main factors. Various studies have demonstrated that the
hygienic-sanitary proﬁle of food handlers is often unacceptable in
terms of health status, personal hygiene practices, and habits, rais-
ing the risk of cross contamination in the handled food (Campos
and others 2009; Hammad and others 2012; Kamal and others
2013; Ferreira and others 2014).

In Brazil, recent study performed by Ferreira and others (2014)
in the same hospitals where was conducted the current study
demonstrated that 28.6% of food handlers were colonized with
MRSA.

Given the recent emergence of livestock-associated MRSA
strains, such as ST398 (Fitzgerald 2012), it is likely that no single
explanation will sufﬁce and that MRSA represents a continuously
emergent phenomenon driven by multifactorial
interactions
between the classic triad of host, pathogen, and environment
(Mediavilla and others 2012).

Conclusions

The high prevalence of MRSA among the tested meats, mainly
in pork and ﬁsh, and the presence of the microorganism in
prepared foods highlighted the necessity of enforcing hygienic
practices within hospital kitchens. In the future, the molecular

and ecological characterization of isolated MRSA strains must
be performed to determine the origin of MRSA contamination.
Better knowledge of the transmission routes of MRSA in the food
chain, “from the farm to the fork,” is necessary to provide tools
for preventing the spread of MRSA in the hospital environment,
to clarify the possible health hazards for consumers related to the
presence of MRSA in foods, and to determine adequate measures
for MRSA control. Furthermore, restrictive policies on antibiotic
use in animal health are necessary for the control of MRSA.
