This study was conducted to determine the prevalence and distribution of Campylobacter species along a broiler
production chain from farm to retail, and to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance proﬁle of Campylobacter iso-
lates. A total of 259 Campylobacter isolates (C. jejuni n = 106, C. coli n = 153) were isolated from broiler ceca sam-
ples (72.5%, 103/142), broiler carcasses (34.1%, 46/135), and retail broiler meat (31.3%, 40/128) samples collected
in Shanghai, China. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of six antimicrobials were determined using the agar dilu-
tion method. High prevalence of resistance to ciproﬂoxacin (C. jejuni: 99.1%;C. coli: 100%) and tetracycline
(C. jejuni: 100%;C. coli: 98.7%) was detected among the C. jejuni and C. coli isolates. The vast majority of C. coli
were resistant to clindamycin (92.2%), gentamicin (95.4%), and erythromycin (94.1%), but only 25.5%, 53.8%,
and 16.0% of C. jejuni exhibited resistance to these three antimicrobials, respectively. In contrast, the prevalence
of ﬂorfenicol resistance in C. jejuni (37.7%) was signiﬁcantly higher than that in C. coli (7.8%) (P b 0.05). It is note-
worthy that all Campylobacter isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobials, and 71.7% of C. jejuni and
98.0% of C. coli isolates exhibited multi-drug resistance (resistant to three or more antimicrobials). Fifty-ﬁve
C. jejuni and sixty C. coli isolates, selected from different production stages, species, and antimicrobial resistance
patterns, were analyzed by pulsed ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE), among which 15 unique PFGE patterns (PFGE
patterns represented by a single strain) and 31 clusters (PFGE patterns represented by multiple strains) were de-
tected. Furthermore, nearly all of the PFGE patterns of the Campylobacter strains isolated from retail broiler meats
overlapped with those of the strains from ceca and slaughterhouse carcasses. Together, these ﬁndings revealed
the high prevalence of Campylobacter species in a broiler chicken production chain, and the concerning situation
of antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter species. The ﬁndings also indicated that Campylobacter isolates from
retail broiler meats were associated with fecal contamination in the slaughterhouse, underlying the need for im-
proved measures for reducing carcass contamination in slaughter plants.

1. Introduction

Campylobacter species, especially C. jejuni and C. coli, are the most fre-
quently identiﬁed foodborne bacteria causing gastroenteritis throughout
the world (Coker et al., 2002). Although most campylobacteriosis occurs
as self-limiting enteritis, more severe and long-lasting cases, particularly
in immune-comprised patients, may require antibiotic treatment
(Gibreel et al., 2004). The macrolides erythromycin and azithromycin
are the antimicrobials of choice when therapeutic intervention is war-
ranted. Other antibiotic options include ﬂuoroquinolones (ciproﬂoxacin),

aminoglycosides (gentamicin), and tetracyclines (Wardak et al., 2007).
Campylobacter species are increasingly resistant to these clinically impor-
tant antibiotics, which compromises clinical therapy and presents a
major threat to public health (Anderson et al., 2001; Cox and Popken,
2006). Use of antimicrobials in animal husbandry contributes to the se-
lection of antibiotic resistant Campylobacter strains that are transmitted
to humans through the food chain (Radostits and Rubinstein, 2002).

Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that handling and con-
sumption of contaminated poultry meat, particularly chicken products,
are a major source of human Campylobacter species infections (Samuel
et al., 2004; Wingstrand et al., 2006). Broiler chickens have been
regarded as one of the main reservoirs of Campylobacter species, and
the colonization level of Campylobacter species in broiler ceca can
reach as high as 109 CFU/g (Stern et al., 2008). Carcass contamination
usually occurs directly via leakage of intestinal contents during the
slaughtering process (Elvers et al., 2011). Studies have been conducted
to investigate the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of
poultry-associated Campylobacter species, and most of them have

reported the emergence of resistant strains (Andersen et al., 2006; Osaili
et al., 2011). In China, an active surveillance system to monitor the prev-
alence and antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter species from farm
to retail is not yet available, and little information has been reported on
Campylobacter species in chicken (Chen et al., 2010). The prevalence
and distribution of Campylobacter species along the broiler production
chain are unknown in China, which hamper the implementation of
interventions.

To collect information concerning Campylobacter in poultry produc-
tion in China, this study tracked Campylobacter contamination in ceca,
carcasses, and retail meats of a broiler production chain in Shanghai,
China. The isolates were proﬁled for antimicrobial susceptibility, and
PFGE was employed to explore the diversity and linkage of Campylobacter
species isolates from different production stages.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sample collection

The investigation was conducted during October and November of
2012 in a vertically-integrated commercial poultry production continu-
um in Shanghai, China, in which more than 1,000,000 broiler chickens
were reared, slaughtered, and sold per year. A total of 142 broiler
cecal samples (one from each broiler), representing samples of broiler
at the farm level, were collected at a slaughterhouse after evisceration.
One hundred and thirty-ﬁve whole broiler carcasses were also sampled
at the end of the processing steps (after chilling) in the slaughterhouse.
Furthermore, 128 whole broiler chicken carcasses were randomly col-
lected from two supermarkets. All of the samples were transported to
the laboratory on ice within 3 h of collection and were analyzed imme-
diately. Although the samples collected from the three stages were
probably derived from different broiler ﬂocks, they belonged to the
same broiler production chain from farm to retail.

2.2. Isolation and Identiﬁcation of Campylobacter species

For each cecal sample, a loopful of fecal material was directly
streaked onto a Campylobacter selective agar plate (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, USA) containing 5% fresh sterile deﬁbrinated sheep blood and
Campylobacter supplement III (Sigma), and then incubated at 42 °C in
a microaerophilic chamber (10% CO2, 5% O2, 85% N2) for 48–72 h
(Chen et al., 2010).

Each whole broiler carcass obtained from the slaughterhouse or su-
permarkets was put into a sterile bag containing 100 mL of nutrient
broth no. 2 (CM0067; Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK). The carcass was mas-
saged for 1 min, then 25 mL of the rinsate was added to 225 mL of
Preston broth (nutrient broth no. 2 CM0067, Campylobacter selective
supplement SR0117E, and Campylobacter growth supplement
SR0232E; Oxoid) containing 5% deﬁbrinated sheep blood. The broth
was then incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, and an additional 44 h at 42 °C
under microaerophilic conditions. A loopful of broth was then streaked
onto a Campylobacter selective agar plate and incubated for 48–72 h at
42 °C under microaerophilic conditions. For each positive plate, up to
three presumptive Campylobacter colonies were selected for further
identiﬁcation using multiplex PCR, as previously described (Keramas
et al., 2003), and API-Campy kits (BioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France).
A primer set speciﬁc for the C. jejuni hippuricase gene and the primer
sets for the 16S/23S rRNA internal regions were used in the multiplex
PCR to identify C. jejuni and C. coli, respectively. Where isolates from
the same sample, only one of the isolates that belonged to the same spe-
cies and had the same antibiotic resistance pattern was selected for the
subsequent analysis. All conﬁrmed isolates were stored at −80 °C in
Brain Heart Infusion broth (Land-bridge, Beijing, China) containing
20% (v/v) glycerol.

2.3. Antibiotic susceptibility testing

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using a standard
agar dilution method in Mueller–Hinton agar supplemented with 5%
sheep blood, as described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Insti-
tute (CLSI, 2008). The agar plates were incubated at 42 °C for 24 h under
a microaerophilic atmosphere. The following antimicrobial agents were
used: ﬂorfenicol, ciproﬂoxacin, tetracycline, clindamycin, gentamicin,
and erythromycin. All the antimicrobial agents were obtained from
the China Institute of Veterinary Drug Control (Beijing, China). C. jejuni
ATCC33560 was used as the quality control organism. Breakpoints for
each antimicrobial agent and quality control (QC) minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) ranges with ATCC 33560 are shown in Table 1.

2.4. Pulsed ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE)

PFGE analysis was performed as previously described (Ribot et al.,
2001), using SmaI as the restriction endonuclease and Salmonella
H9812 as the reference marker (digested with XbaI) (Hunter et al.,

2005). PFGE results were analyzed using the InfoQuest FP software ver-
sion 4.5 (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and the banding patterns were clus-
tered using Dice coefﬁcients with a 2% band position tolerance and
1.5% optimization. A PFGE pattern was deﬁned as a group of strains
with a Dice coefﬁcient similarity of 85% or greater, and the PFGE pattern
represented by multiple strains was a PFGE cluster.

2.5. Statistical analysis

Prevalence and frequency of antimicrobial resistance proﬁles of
Campylobacter isolates obtained from different stages were compared
using the Chi-square test in the statistical software SPSS 17.0
(SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Differences were considered signiﬁcant at
P b 0.05.

3. Results and Discussion

3.1. Incidence of Campylobacter species

Overall, 103 of the 142 (72.5%) cecal samples tested positive
(Table 2) for Campylobacter species, and 17 of the 142 (12.0%) positive
samples were positive for both C. jejuni and C. coli, indicating the high
prevalence of Campylobacter in broiler ceca. Considering that only
three colonies were picked from each positive plate, the real positive
rate for both species might be even higher. A total of 157 Campylobacter
isolates were obtained from ceca, including 69 C. jejuni and 88 C. coli.
Among the 135 broiler carcasses from the slaughterhouse, 46

carcass samples obtained from supermarkets, 40 (31.3%) samples
tested positive for Campylobacter species and 59 Campylobacter
isolates were obtained, among which 14 and 32 were identiﬁed
as C. jejuni and C. coli, respectively (Table 2). The prevalence of
Campylobacter species in retail broiler carcasses was lower than
that in carcasses from the slaughterhouse, but the difference was
not statistically signiﬁcant (P = 0.63). After packaging, the broiler
meats were immediately transported to supermarkets at 4 °C. The
short time of exposure to air and favorable temperature conditions
might help Campylobacter species to survive, which could explain
the similar prevalence rates between slaughterhouse carcasses
and retail carcasses.

Interestingly, this study found that C. coli (59.1%, 153/259) was
more prevalent than C. jejuni (40.9%, 106/259) (Table 2). Two recent
investigations by our laboratory carried out in Shandong and Henan
Provinces, China, in 2011 and 2013 also showed similar ﬁndings
(unpublished data). Similar results, showing that C. coli was the pre-
dominant Campylobacter species in broiler intestinal tracts, were
also reported in Grenada (Hariharan et al., 2009) and Reunion Island
(Henry et al., 2011). However, the higher prevalence of C. coli in
broiler chickens is contrary to the ﬁndings in an earlier study con-
ducted in Shandong Province (Chen et al., 2010) and in many reports
from other countries, such as Hungary (Damjanova et al., 2011),
Ethiopia (Ewnetu and Mihret, 2010), and Korea (Kang et al., 2006),

where C. jejuni was reported to be the predominant Campylobacter
species in broiler chickens. The new information from our present
work may indicate that C. coli
is becoming the predominant
Campylobacter species in chickens in China.

3.2. Antimicrobial susceptibility

All of the 259 Campylobacter isolates (106 C. jejuni and 153 C. coli)
were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing against six antimi-
crobial agents belonging to six different antimicrobial classes. The re-
sults are presented in Tables 3 and 4. All 259 Campylobacter isolates
recovered from the broiler production chain were resistant to at least
one of the tested antimicrobial agents. Notably, nearly all of the isolates
were resistant to ciproﬂoxacin (C. jejuni: 99.1%;C. coli: 100%) and tetra-
cycline (C. jejuni: 100%;C. coli: 98.7%) (Table 5). These results are consis-
tent with a previous ﬁnding that nearly 100% of Campylobacter isolates
from broiler chickens in China were resistant to ciproﬂoxacin and tetra-
cycline (Chen et al., 2010). Moreover, the vast majority of C. coli isolates
were also resistant to clindamycin (92.2%), gentamicin (95.4%), and
erythromycin (94.1%). Furthermore, 121 of the 153 (79.1%) C. coli iso-
lates exhibited high-level (MIC ≥ 256 μg/mL) erythromycin resistance.
Compared to those of C. coli, the resistance rates of C. jejuni to
clindamycin (25.5%), gentamicin (53.8%), and erythromycin (16.0%)
were relatively low. The lowest resistance observed in these Campylo-
bacter species was to ﬂorfenicol. Interestingly, the prevalence of
ﬂorfenicol resistance in C. jejuni isolates (37.7%) was signiﬁcantly higher

than that in C. coli (7.8%) (P b 0.05). The variation in antimicrobial resis-
tance between C. jejuni and C. coli might be attributed to their intrinsic
ability to develop resistance to these antimicrobials (Chen et al.,
2010). In addition, compared to C. jejuni from the other two sources,
the isolates obtained from broiler cecal samples exhibited the highest
resistance to clindamycin (31.9%), gentamicin (71.0%), and erythromy-
cin (18.8%). The variation in prevalence of antimicrobial resistance
among Campylobacter isolates derived from different production stages
could be explained by the speculation that antibiotic resistance might
has a ﬁtness cost to the organism and therefore affects survival during
the production process, which will be examined in future studies.

Antimicrobial resistance patterns of C. jejuni and C. coli isolates are
outlined in Table 6. The 259 Campylobacter strains exhibited 15 antimicro-
bial resistance patterns. It is alarming that all but one of the Campylobacter
isolates were resistant to two or more antimicrobials. Furthermore, 228 of
the 259 (88.0%) Campylobacter isolates exhibited multi-drug resistance,
higher than ﬁgures reported from other countries, including Northern
Ireland (25.0%) (Wilson, 2003), France (37.0%) (Payot et al., 2004),
Canada (29.7%) (Varela et al., 2007), and Korea (56.1%) (Shin and Lee,
2010). Considering resistance by species, multi-drug resistance was
higher among C. coli (98.0%, 150/153) than C. jejuni (71.7%, 76/106), con-
sistent with results reported by others (Noormohamed and Fakhr, 2012).
For the C. coli isolates from all three production stages, there was a single
predominant antimicrobial resistance pattern: C-T-L-G-E (resistant to cip-
roﬂoxacin, tetracycline, clindamycin, gentamicin, and erythromycin). In
contrast, the antimicrobial resistance patterns of C. jejuni varied across
the broiler production chain, and the major common patterns were C-T
and F-C-T (Table 6).

In China, ﬂuoroquinolones, tetracyclines, macrolides, and aminogly-
cosides are commonly used to treat and prevent bacterial diseases in
poultry. Most of these antimicrobials are readily available to producers,
who may not necessarily consult with veterinarians prior to their use.
Hence, inappropriate use of antimicrobials likely occurs on farms. The
high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter species
could be attributed to extensive use of antimicrobials in broiler chicken
production, which select for the emergence and spread of antimicrobial
resistant Campylobacter isolates. It is worth noting that a high preva-
lence of ﬂorfenicol resistance in C. jejuni was observed in this study.
Florfenicol resistance in Campylobacter species is rarely reported world-
wide (Ozawa et al., 2012; Perez-Boto et al., 2013), and the high preva-
lence in China might be caused by use of ﬂorfenicol in food-producing

animals. Another important ﬁnding of this study is the extremely high
prevalence of multidrug resistance in the C. coli isolates, which could ex-
plain why C. coli is replacing C. jejuni to become the predominant
Campylobacter species in chickens in China. Thus, we speculate that
C. coli is intrinsically more adaptable to antimicrobial treatment, and
the extensive use of antimicrobials in broiler production may have fa-
vorably selected C. coli over C. jejuni.

3.3. PFGE patterns of Campylobacter isolates

A total of 55 C. jejuni and 60 C. coli isolates, representing isolates of
different production stages, species, and antimicrobial resistance pat-
terns, were selected for PFGE analysis (Table 6). The 55 C. jejuni isolates

were grouped into 6 unique PFGE patterns (PFGE patterns represented
by a single strain) and 17 clusters (PFGE patterns represented by multi-
ple strains), while the 60 C. coli isolates were grouped into 9 unique
PFGE patterns and 14 clusters. Slaughterhouse samples carried the
most PFGE patterns (29 patterns), followed by retail samples (23 pat-
terns), and cecal samples (19 patterns). With the exception of the
strains with C. jejuni cluster m and unique pattern 15, and C. coli cluster
2 strains, which were only detected in retail samples, the PFGE patterns
of most of the Campylobacter isolates from retail broiler meats were also
found in strains from ceca or slaughter carcasses (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2), indi-
cating that the majority of Campylobacter contamination of retail broiler
meats occurred in the processing plants. For example, PFGE pattern q of
C. jejuni, and PFGE patterns 6 and 10 of C. coli were found in all three

stages of the production chain. Campylobacter contamination of car-
casses occurs during multiple steps of slaughtering,
including
defeathering, evisceration, and water chilling (Franchin et al., 2005). It
has been suggested that the most effective mitigation strategy is a com-
bination of chemical decontamination of carcasses and technical mea-
sures to reduce fecal contamination during slaughtering (Havelaar
et al., 2005).

In summary, this study represents the ﬁrst report describing the
prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter species in a
broiler chicken production chain in China. There is currently no infor-
mation about the prevalence of Campylobacter species in humans in

Shanghai, China. Thus, it will be very informative to investigate the rela-
tionship between Campylobacter species collected from animals and
humans, and this topic requires further study. The high prevalence of
Campylobacter in broiler chickens necessitates the implementation of
improved intervention measures at the production and processing
levels to minimize the occurrence of contamination. In addition, antimi-
crobial resistance was highly prevalent in Campylobacter species, and
the majority of Campylobacter isolates were resistant to multiple anti-
microbials, with high MIC values. The prevalence of antimicrobial resis-
tance in Campylobacter species can be attributed to extensive use of
antimicrobials in the broiler chicken production system in China. It

has been reported that resistant Campylobacter strains can be transmit-
ted to humans through the food chain (Endtz et al., 1991; Hurd et al.,
2008), which poses a serious risk for treatment failure. Given that con-
taminated broiler meat is the major source of human Campylobacter in-
fections (Guerin et al., 2007), prudent measures for antimicrobial usage
and active surveillance systems should be established to contain the
prevalence and spread of antimicrobial resistant Campylobacter in
chickens. Furthermore, most strains from retail broiler meats had the
same antimicrobial resistance proﬁles and PFGE patterns as those
from the previous stages of the production chain. These ﬁndings have
important implications for the control of Campylobacter contamination
in the food chain, and provide useful information for antimicrobial resis-
tance risk assessment in poultry.
