To   describe   the  prevalence   and   population   structure   of  Staphylococcus   aureus   bacteria   that   colonize   pigs
at  slaughterhouses   in   northeastern   China,   nose  swabs   were   collected   from   pigs   in   two   slaughterhouses   in
Harbin,   Heilongjiang   Province,   China   in   2009.   S.  aureus   isolates   were   characterized   by   multilocus   sequence
typing   (MLST),   spa  typing,   SCCmec   typing,   antimicrobial   susceptibility   testing   and  pvl  gene   detection.   A
total   of  200   S.   aureus   isolates   were   collected   from   590   pigs   (33.9%,   200/590),   of  which   162   (81%,  162/200)
were   methicillin-susceptible   S.  aureus   (MSSA)   and   38   (19%,   38/200)   were   methicillin-resistant   S.  aureus
(MRSA).   Ninety-nine   of   the   MSSA   isolates   (99/162,   61.1%)   were   ST398,   which   represented   the   dominant
sequence   type   overall.   Eighty-seven   isolates   were   ST9   (87/200,   43.5%),   and   all   MRSA   belonged   to  that
sequence   type   which   consisted   of  the   spa   types   t899   and  t2922.   Among   the   MSSA   strains,   t034,   t899  and
t4358   were   the  most   dominant   spa   types   (139/162,   85.8%).   All   MRSA   isolates   harbored   SCCmec   type   IVb.
The  pvl   gene   was   only   detected   in  3  ST7/t2119   MSSA   isolates.   All  MRSA   but   more   importantly   also   82.7%
(134/162)   of   the   MSSA   isolates   were  resistant   to   six  or   more   antibiotics.   Moreover,   a   novel   resistance
determinant-lsa(E)   was   identiﬁed   among   22%   (44/200)   of  all   isolates.   In  conclusion,   pigs   in   northeast
China   are   frequently   colonized   with   ST398   MSSA.   MRSA   with   this   sequence   type,   typically   associated
with   pigs   in   Europe,   was   not   found.   High   levels   of  multiple   antibiotic   resistance   among   MRSA   isolates   as
well   as  MSSA   isolates   are   a  public   health   concern.

Introduction

Staphylococcus  aureus  is  a  well-known  commensal  and  pathogen
of  many  animal  species,  including  humans.  Although  most  S.  aureus
are  host-speciﬁc,  the  potential  for  animals  to  act  as  a  source  of  S.
aureus  infections  for  humans  has  been  shown  for  some  clonal  lin-
eages,  such  as  sequence  type  (ST)  398  (Garcia-Alvarez  et  al.,  2011;
Van  Cleef  et  al.,  2011).  Moreover,  the  propensity  of  S.  aureus  to
develop  multiple  drug  resistance  (MDR)  has  played  the  key  role  in
triggering  pandemic  spread  (Holden  et  al.,  2013).  Hence,  farm  ani-
mals  could  be  an  important  ecological  niche  for  the  emergence  of
MDR   S.  aureus  because  massive  antibiotics  use  for  treatment,  pre-
vention  of  diseases  or  growth  promotion  provides  the  necessary
evolutionary  constraints.

Methicillin-resistant  S.  aureus  (MRSA)  in  pigs  was   ﬁrst  reported
in  France  and  was  subsequently  demonstrated  to  belong  to  a  dis-
tinct  clone,  ST398  (Armand-Lefevre  et  al.,  2005).  Later,  the  ST398
MRSA  clone  was  discovered  to  be  widespread  in  pig  farms  in  the
Netherlands,  where  transmission  to  humans  was  reported  for  the
ﬁrst  time  (Voss  et  al.,  2005;  Armand-Lefevre  et  al.,  2005).  ST398
MRSA  has  been  widely  identiﬁed  in  several  countries  in  Europe
(Witte  et  al.,  2007),  North  America  (Smith  et  al.,  2009;  Khanna  et  al.,
2008)  and  Asia  (Lim  et  al.,  2012;  Sergio  et  al.,  2007).  ST398  MRSA
possess  several  typical  features,  including  (i)  non-typability  by
standard  SmaI  pulsed-ﬁeld  gel  electrophoresis  analysis  due  to  DNA
methylation,  (ii)  t034,  t011,  and  t108  being  the  dominant  spa  types,
(iii)  presence  of  SCCmec  types  IVa  or  V,  (iv)  absence  of  lukS  and  lukF
coding  for  PVL  and  (v)  resistance  to  tetracycline  (Vanderhaeghen
et  al.,  2010;  Bens  et  al.,  2006).  Persons  in  direct  contact  with  MRSA-
positive  animals  have  an  increased  risk  of  becoming  MRSA  positive
(Morgan,  2008).

In  China,  previous  studies  revealed  ST9  MRSA  isolates  as  a  pre-
dominant  clone  in  pigs  (Wagenaar  et  al.,  2009;  Cui  et  al.,  2009),
whereas  ST398-MRSA-V-spa  t034  was   only  reported  once,  in  a  pet
hospital  in  Beijing  (Zhang  et  al.,  2011),  and  was  likely  of  human  ori-
gin.  Little  is  known  about  the  prevalence,  population  structure  and

antibiotic  susceptibility  of  methicillin-susceptible  S.  aureus  (MSSA)
carried  by  pigs  in  China.  The  objective  of  this  study  was   to  char-
acterize  the  prevalence  of  S.  aureus  and  its  population  structure
among  colonized  pigs  in  northeastern  China.

Materials  and  methods

Sample  collection

From  September  through  November  2009,  nose  swabs  were
taken  from  590  pigs  in  two  slaughterhouses  located  68  km  apart  in
Harbin  city,  Heilongjiang  Province,  northeastern  China.  Pigs  came
to  one  slaughterhouse  from  26  medium-sized  industrial  farms  and
to  the  other  slaughterhouse  from  29  small  private  farms.  Pigs  were
slaughtered  at  the  same  day  after  they  were  collected  from  different
farms.  Samples  from  individual  pigs  were  processed  separately.

Sample  preparation

Swabs  were  enriched  in  tryptic  soy  broth  (OXOID,  Basingstoke,
England)  with  7%  NaCl  at  37 ◦C  for  24  h  and  then  plated  onto  man-
nitol  salt  agar  (OXOID,  Basingstoke,  UK)  and  cultured  at  37 ◦C  for
24  h.  Presumptive  S.  aureus  colonies  were  identiﬁed  at  the  species
level  by  coagulase  production  using  the  Slidex  Staph  Plus  kit  (Murex
Biotech,  Kent,  UK)  and  PCR  for  the  nuc  gene  (Brakstad  et  al.,  1992).
The  presence  of  the  mecA  gene  was  determined  and  used  to  deﬁne
the  MRSA  genotype  (Brakstad  et  al.,  1992).

Molecular  typing

All  of  the  isolates  were  characterized  using  spa  typing  (Harmsen
et  al.,  2003)  and  multilocus  sequence  typing  (MLST)  (Enright  et  al.,
2000).  Based  Upon  Repeat  Pattern  (BURP)  analysis  was  used  to
group  spa  types  into  spa  clonal  complexes  (spa-CCs)  (Mellmann
et  al.,  2007).  The  spa  type  was  excluded  from  BURP  analysis  if  it
was  shorter  than  5  repeats.  All  MRSA  isolates  were  investigated  by
SCCmec  typing  (Zhang  et  al.,  2005).

Antimicrobial  susceptibility

A  total  of  21  antimicrobial  agents  were  tested,  including  peni-
cillin  (PEN),  cefoxitin  (FOX),  tetracycline  (TET),  chlortetracycline
(CTT),  ciproﬂoxacin  (CIP),  chloramphenicol  (CHL),  erythromycin
(ERY),  clindamycin  (CLI),  gentamicin  (GEN),  rifampicin  (RIF),
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  (SXT),  nitrofurantoin  (NIT),  quin-
upristin/dalfopristin  (Q/D),  vancomycin  (VAN),  teicoplanin  (TEC),
linezolid  (LZD),  tigecycline  (TGC),  daptomycin  (DAP),  fusidic  acid
(FUS),  fosfomycin  (FOF)  and  mupirocin  (MUP).  Eighteen  antimi-
crobial  agents  were  tested  using  the  agar  dilution  method  on
Mueller-Hinton  agar;  the  others  (quinupristin/dalfopristin,  tigecy-
cline  and  daptomycin)  were  tested  by  Etest  (AB  bioMérieux,  Solna,
Sweden).  The  MICs  for  most  of  the  antimicrobials  were  interpreted
using  CLSI  criteria  (Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards  Institute,
2010),  but  the  EUCAST  clinical  breakpoint  (www.eucast.org)  was
used  for  fosfomycin  and  chlortetracycline.  The  resistance  break-
points  for  mupirocin  and  fusidic  acid  were  deﬁned  as  previously
described  (Finlay  et  al.,  1997;  MacGowan  and  Wise,  2001).  S.  aureus
ATCC29213  was  included  for  internal  quality  control.  All  quin-
upristin/dalfopristin  resistant  isolates  were  investigated  for  the
resistance  genes  vat(A),  vat(B),  vat(C),  vga(A),  vga(A)variant,   vga(B),
vga(C),  vga(E),  cfr  and  lsa(E)  by  PCR  (Table  S1).

pvl  gene  detection

Panton-Valentine  leukocidin  (PVL)  genes  (lukS-PV  and  lukF-PV)

were  detected  by  PCR  as  previously  described  (Lina  et  al.,  1999).

Statistical  analysis

The  quantitative  variables  were  analyzed  using  chi-square  tests
in  PASW  Statistics  18.0.3  (SPSS  Inc.,  Chicago,  Illinois,  US).  P-values
≤0.05  were  considered  statistically  signiﬁcant.

Results

Prevalence  of  S.  aureus

A  total  of  200  S.  aureus  isolates  were  recovered  from  590  slaugh-
ter  pigs  (200/590,  33.9%),  including  38  MRSA  isolates  (38/590,
6.4%).  The  prevalence  of  MRSA  among  pigs  and  the  number  of
MRSA-positive  farms  were  signiﬁcantly  higher  in  Slaughterhouse
1  (Table  1).

Molecular  characterization  of  S.  aureus  isolates

MLST  typing  for  all  the  isolates  revealed  seven  ST  types:  ST7,
ST9,  ST398,  ST2113,  ST2366,  ST1375  and  ST2773  (Table  2).  Among
MSSA,  ST398  was   the  most  frequent  ST  type  and  was  identiﬁed
in  99  of  162  isolates  (99/162,  61.1%);  this  was   followed  by  ST9
(49/162,  30.2%).  ST9  was  the  only  ST  type  among  the  38  MRSA
isolates.  ST2113,  ST2366  and  ST2773  were  new  ST  types.  ST2366
represents  a  single  locus  variant  (SLV)  of  ST9,  while  ST1375  repre-
sents  a  SLV  of  ST398.  Spa  typing  of  all  of  the  isolates  identiﬁed  nine
spa  types  and  2  spa-CCs  (Table  2).  The  dominant  spa  type  was  t899
(33/38,  86.8%)  among  MRSA  isolates,  while  t034  and  t899  were  the
most  prevalent  spa  types  among  MSSA,  representing  55.6%  (90/162)
and  30.9%  (50/162),  respectively.  Based  on  spa  repeat  and  BURP
analysis,  two   new  spa  types,  t1446  and  t5462,  belonging  to  ST398
may   have  evolved  in  the  MSSA  isolates  from  t034  spa  types  that
acquired  one  new  spa  repeat  (r31)  and  three  spa  repeats  (r34-r24-
r25),  respectively.  In  MRSA  isolates,  t899  is  the  probable  ancestor
of  t4358  and  t4474,  which  have  separately  acquired  one  spa  repeat
(r02)  and  changed  one  spa  repeat  from  r07  to  r26  by  point  mutation.
All  MRSA  isolates  were  SCCmec  type  IVb  and  pvl  negative.  Three
MSSA  isolates  with  ST7  were  found  to  be  pvl  positive.

Antimicrobial  susceptibility

All  MRSA 

isolates  were  resistant  to  most  of  the  antibi-
otics  tested  (Table  3).  Importantly,  two   predominant  multidrug
resistance  proﬁles  were  identiﬁed:  PEN-FOX-TET-CTT-CIP-CHL-
ERY-CLI-GEN-QDA  and  PEN-FOX-TET-CTT-CIP-CHL-ERY-CLI-GEN-
QDA-SXT,  which  accounted  for  39.5%  (15/38)  and  36.8%  (14/38)
of  all  MRSA  isolates,  respectively.  The  majority  of  MSSA  isolates
(134/162,  82.7%)  were  resistant  to  six  or  more  antibiotics.  Com-
pared  with  MRSA  isolates,  the  resistance  proﬁles  of  MSSA  isolates
were  more  diverse.  Twenty-six  antibiotic  proﬁles  were  identiﬁed
and  PEN-TET-CTT-CIP-ERY-CLI-GEN-CHL,  PEN-TET-CTT-CIP-ERY-
CLI-GEN  and  PEN-TET-CIP-ERY-CLI-GEN  accounted 
for  59.9%
(97/162)  of  all  resistance  proﬁles  in  MSSA  isolates.  All  MRSA  and
seven  MSSA  isolates  were  resistant  to  quinupristin/dalfopristin.

Furthermore,  PCR  analysis  revealed  that  44  of  45  quin-
upristin/dalfopristin  resistant  strains  were  positive  for  the  lsa(E)
gene.  In  contrast,  the  remaining  1  isolate  harbored  none  of  the  cur-
rently  known  quinupristin/dalfopristin  resistance  genes.  ST9  was
the  only  ST  type  among  the  44  lsa(E)  positive  strains  of  which  7
(7/44,  15.9%)  were  MSSA  and  37  were  MRSA(37/44,  84.1%)(Table
S2).  Two   spa  types  were  observed  of  which  t899  was   the  dominant

Discussion

Heilongjiang  is  an  important  agricultural  province  in  China.
In  2011,  16  million  pigs  were  raised  for  food  production  in  this
province  alone.  Until  now,  no  data  have  been  available  on  the
occurrence  of  MRSA  and  MSSA  in  pigs  from  this  area.  The  preva-
lence  of  MRSA  (38/590,  6.4%)  in  pigs  observed  in  this  study  was
lower  than  the  prevalence  in  other  regions  in  China  (Cui  et  al.,
2009;  Wang  et  al.,  2012),  Europe  (Tenhagen  et  al.,  2009;  de  Neeling
et  al.,  2007;  Gomez-Sanz  et  al.,  2010)  and  North  America  (Smith
et  al.,  2009;  Khanna  et  al.,  2008),  but  higher  than  the  prevalence
in  some  other  Asian  countries  (Lim  et  al.,  2012;  Neela  et  al.,  2009;
Baba  et  al.,  2010).  Despite  this  moderate  frequency  of  MRSA  among

slaughter  pigs  in  our  study,  multiple  drug  resistance  (MDR)  pheno-
type  deﬁned  as  resistance  against  6  or  more  antibiotic  was  86%
(172/200)  among  all  isolates  suggestive  of  a  signiﬁcant  reservoir  of
antibiotic  resistance  among  farm  animals  in  China.

Differences  were  observed  in  the  prevalence  of  MRSA  and  the
number  of  farms  with  MRSA  between  the  two  slaughterhouses.  It
can  be  speculated  that  the  origins  of  these  pigs  and  their  rearing
patterns  were  different.  Slaughterhouse  1  was   much  bigger  than
slaughterhouse  2.  Most  of  the  pigs  in  slaughterhouse  1  came  from
larger  farms,  while  in  slaughterhouse  2  most  of  the  pigs  came  from
smaller  farms  where  animals  were  kept  free-range.  Although  MRSA
carriage  and  transmission  among  pigs  may   not  be  a  signiﬁcant
problem  in  this  region,  monitoring  the  occurrence  of  resistance  in
pigs  may   be  advisable  because  certain  clones  may   have  the  propen-
sity  to  expand  in  the  human  population.

This  is  the  ﬁrst  study  to  report  the  genetic  population  struc-
ture  of  S.  aureus  (MRSA  and  MSSA)  from  slaughterhouse  pigs  in

northeast  China.  We   found  that  ST398  was  the  most  frequent
ST  type  (99/162,  61.1%)  among  MSSA,  whereas  MRSA  with  this
sequence  type,  typically  associated  with  pigs  in  Europe,  was
not  identiﬁed.  ST398  MSSA  is  also  a  frequent  community  and
hospital-acquired  infections  associated  strain  among  humans  in
China  (Zhao  et  al.,  2012;  Wu  et  al.,  2010;  Chen  et  al.,  2010).
In  Europe,  ST398  MRSA  is  associated  with  animal  origin  and
is  occasionally  transmitted  to  humans  via  occupational  expo-
sure  to  farm  animals.  Whole-genome  sequencing  approaches  and
microarrays  analysis  of  a  large  amount  of  ST398  isolates  from
different  host  species  suggested  that  ST398  was  most 
likely
of  human  origin,  and  was   occasionally  transmitted  to  livestock
companied  with  acquisition  of  SCCmec   (Price  LB  et  al.,  2012;
Uhlemann  et  al.,  2012).  Our  study  did  not  sample  persons  in
direct  contact  with  pigs,  such  as  slaughterhouse  workers  and
farmers.  Whether  transmission  between  humans  and  pigs 
is
occurring  in  China  is  still  unknown,  but  such  transmission  is
likely.

Resistance  to  multiple  antibiotics,  not  only  among  MRSA  iso-
lates,  but  notably  also  among  MSSA  isolates,  is  a  matter  of  concern.
It  suggests  that  a  substantial  amount  of  antimicrobials  are  used
in  pig  farming  for  growth  promotion,  prophylactic  or  therapeutic
purposes.  A  high  prevalence  of  multiple  antimicrobial  resistance  in
pig  isolates  was  also  found  in  another  province  (Shanxi)  (Wang
et  al.,  2012),  and  an  abundance  of  diverse  antibiotic  resistance
genes  (ARGs)  have  been  found  on  Chinese  pig  farms  (Zhu  et  al.,
2013);  in  contrast,  most  MSSA  in  Chinese  hospitals  have  main-
tained  a  high  degree  of  susceptibility  to  most  antimicrobial  agents,
mainly  exhibiting  erythromycin  and  clindamycin  resistance  (Xiao
et  al.,  2011).  No  doubt,  there  remains  a  potential  threat  to  human
health  that  resistant  strains  or  resistance  genes  that  have  emerged
in  pigs  (Zhu  et  al.,  2013)  are  introduced  into  human  health  care
institutions.

In  this  study,  all  quinupristin/dalfopristin  resistant  strains
belonged  to  ST9.  This  may   be  the  result  of  clonal  expansion
most  likely  originating  from  breeding  farms  and  the  selection
of  ST9  by  the  use  of  virginiamycin  against  which  the  quin-
upristin/dalfopristin  resistant  isolates  exhibit  cross-resistance  or
deﬁciency  of  DNA  restriction  systems  likely  to  facilitate  the  hor-
izontal  gene  transfer  of  “foreign”  DNA,  as  has  been  found  in
ST398  (Schijffelen  et  al.,  2010).  Virginiamycin  belongs  to  the  same
antibiotic  group  (streptogramin)  as  quinupristin/dalfopristin.  This
compound  has  been  widely  used  for  more  than  25  years  as  an  ani-
mal   growth  promoter  (AGP)  in  poultry,  cattle  and  swine.  Because
of  concerns  that  cross  resistance  between  virginiamycin  and  quin-
upristin/dalfopristin  could  lead  to  treatment  failure  in  humans,
virginiamycin  was  banned  from  animal  use  in  Europe.  In  China,
however,  it  is  still  widely  used.  In  our  study,  98%  (44/45)  of  the
quinupristin/dalfopristin  resistant  strains  harbored  the  new  resis-
tance  gene,  lsa(E),  which  was  ﬁrst  described  recently  (Wendlandt
et  al.,  2013;  Li  et  al.,  2013).  High  homology  between  the  sequence
of  the  new  transposon  carrying  lsa(E)  in  S.  aureus  and  the  sequence
of  the  Enterococcus  faecalis  plasmid  pEF418  demonstrated  the  hor-
izontal  gene  transfer  interspecies  (Wendlandt  et  al.,  2013).  So
far,  the  gene  lsa(E)  has  been  only  described  in  ST9  strains  (both
MRSA  and  MSSA)  in  China,  but  different  spa  types,  antibiotic
resistance  proﬁle  and  genomic  location  of  the  gene  lsa(E)  were
observed.  Whether  the  transposon  has  entered  ST9  only  once
and  then  diversiﬁed  and  spread  to  different  regions  in  China  or,
more  likely,  that  the  transposon  prefers  the  ST9  background  and
has  been  acquired  by  ST9  on  several  occasions  still  need  to  be
explained.

To  our  surprise,  ST398  MSSA  was  the  predominant  clone  among
slaughterhouse  pigs  in  northeast  China.  We   hope  that  this  ﬁnding
will  improve  the  understanding  of  the  global  population  history  of
ST398.
