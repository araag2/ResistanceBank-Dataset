Abstract 

This  study  was  conducted  to  estimate  the  apparent  prevalence  of  Salmonella  spp.  in 

chicken  livers  obtained  from  markets  in  Entre  Ríos,  Argentina,  using  two  culture  methods 

(preenrichment  and  direct  selective  agar  plating).  We  also  determined  the  antimicrobial 

resistance of  Salmonella  isolated  strains  and  evaluated  the  performance  of  the  two  culture 

methods  and  selective-differential  plating  media  used  for  Salmonella  isolation.  Of  666  chicken 

livers studied, 32 organs (4.8%) related to 4 poultry slaughterhouse companies were positive for 

Salmonella sp. using one or two culture methods. Fifty Salmonella strains were isolated from the 

positive  liver  samples  and  were  typed  into  3  serovars:  S.  ser.  Schwarzengrund  (78%),  S.  ser. 

Enteritidis (18 %), and S. ser. Typhimurium 4(%). More than one Salmonella serovar was found 

in livers belonging to two chicken slaughterhouse companies. All strains were susceptible to all 

antibiotics  tested,  with  the  exception  of  erythromycin  (100%  resistant)  and  streptomycin  (22% 

intermediate sensitivity).. Overall, 32 (4.80%) and 3 (0.45%) of the chicken liver samples were 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

positive  for  Salmonella  sp.  in  pre-enrichment  method  and  direct  selective  agar  plating  method, 

respectively; these percentages were significantly different (P=0.0001; kappa= 0.16). There was 

also a statistical difference in relative accuracy, sensitivity and negative predictive value between 

the  pre-enrichment  method  and  the  direct  selective  agar  plating  method;  the  first  had  greater 

values for these parameters than the direct selective agar plating method. These parameters were 

statistically different  between MacConkey agar (MCA) and modified lysine iron (MLIA) in  the 

two  culture  methods;  the  second  had  greater  values  than  MCA  for  both  culture  methods.  This 

study  shows  that  even  though  serovars  that  are  important  for  public  health  were  isolated,  the 

prevalence  of  Salmonella  sp.  is  low  in  chicken  livers  from  Entre  Rios,  Argentina.  The  isolated 

strains  do not  have multiresistance patterns. Furthermore, the preenrichment  method and MLIA

are  superior  to  the  direct  selective  agar  plating  method  and  MCA  for  Salmonella  sp.  isolation 

from chicken liver samples, respectively.

1. Introduction 

 

 

Commercially  grown  chickens  process  large  amounts  of  feed.  The  liver  carries  out  a 

large  number  of  important  digestive,  metabolic  and  excretory  activities,  all  of  which  have  a 

significant role on the health and productivity in poultry (Dutta, 2010).  Because it is rich in iron, 

zinc and some vitamins, chicken liver is a food source and it is used in different recipes, such as 

rice,  soup  or  sauces  (Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Livestock  and  Fisheries  of  the  Republic  of 

Argentina  ,  2014).  Giblets  (edible  viscera)  includes  the  chicken  liver,  heart,  gizzard  and  neck 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

are among the food products that cause the most concern to public health authorities, because of 

the  associated  risks  of  bacterial  food  poisoning.  Contamination  with  Salmonella  in  poultry 

products  can  occur  at  any  step  along  the  food  chain,  which  consists  of  production,  processing, 

distribution,  retail  marketing,  handling  and  preparation  (Dookeran,  Baccus-Taylor,  Akingbala, 

Tameru,  &  Lammerding,  2012).  The  modernization  of  chicken  farms  and  globalization  of  the 

bird  breeding  trade  have  also  have  played  a  role  in  the  bacterial  contamination  of  poultry 

(Argentine Food Code, 2017). 

Giblets  (predominately  the  liver)  may  be  contaminated  with  bacteria,  for  example 

Salmonella  (Molla  &   Mesfin,  2003;  El-Aziz,  2013),  which  presents  an  important  global  public 

health  problem,  with  substantial  morbidity,  as  well  as  having  a  significant  economic  impact 

(Sharma & Carlson, 2000). Since the liver is the predominate organ involved, it is the preferred 

organ to  culture to  detect bacterial contamination  (Gast,  2013). Poultry meat  and its derivatives 

products (Velge, Cloeckeart, & Barrow., 2005). 

Due  to  their  widespread  use,  numerous  bacteriological  culture  media  (selective 

enrichment  broths  and  selective  agar  plates)  are  used  to  monitor  Salmonella  in  food  and  food 

ingredients.  The  media  may  contain  inhibitors  to  stop  or  delay  the  growth  of  non-target

should be used (Gast, 2013).  

 The  antimicrobials  are  used  by  the  poultry  industry  to  enhance  growth  and  feed 

efficiency and to reduce bacterial disease. Antibiotic residues in food of animal origin produces a 

potential  threat  for  direct  toxicity  in  humans  (cancer,  allergic  reaction,  etc.),  and  low  levels  of 

antibiotic  exposure  may  result  in  the  alteration  of  microflora  and  the  possibility  of  antibiotic

organisms,  have  particular  substrates  that  only  the  target  bacteria  can  degrade,  or  that  confer  a 

particular  color  to  the  growing  colonies  (Manafi,  2000).  However,  the  process  of  isolating 

Salmonella  spp.  is  to  some  extend  prone  to  failure.  Depending  on  the  type  of  competitive 

bacteria, detection of occasional colonies of Salmonella may be easier if the appropriate plating 

medium  is  used.  Unfortunately,  the  composition  of  the  flora  is  never  known  in  advance; 

therefore, the appropriate plating medium may not be used for culture (Busse, 1995). Numerous 

agar  media  are  available  for  the  isolation  of  salmonellae  so,  at  least,  two  different  media,

resistance  (Ahaduzzaman,  Hassan,  Alam,  Islam  &  Uddin  ..,  2014;  Hassan  et  al.,  2014).  During 

the  past  few  decades,  there  has  been  a  growing  public  health  concern  over  the  worldwide 

emergence  of  antibiotic-resistant  strains  of  a  number  of  pathogenic  bacteria,  including 

Salmonella  (Capita  &Alonso-Calleja,  2013).  Although  most  cases  of  human  salmonellosis  are 

self-limiting  and  typically  resolved  in  five  to  seven  days  without  antimicrobial  treatment, 

antibiotic  therapy  may  be  necessary  for  severe  cases,  extraintestinal  disease  or  if  a  person  is 

immunocompromised (Berrang et al., 2009). In this scenario, Salmonella strains that are resistant 

to antimicrobials are especially threatening because they may compromise the effective treatment 

of human salmonellosis. People infected with antibiotic-resistant strains are more likely to suffer 

an adverse health event such as prolonged illness, increased severity of illness, hospitalization or 

 

5 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

 

death than those infected with susceptible strains (Cook et al., 2009). Recently, the World Health 

Organization  (2017)  published  a  global  priority  list  of  antibiotic-resistant  bacteria  to  guide 

research, discovery, and development of new antibiotics, where Salmonella spp. fluoroquinolone- 

resistant is considered a priority 2 (high). Therefore, the monitoring of antimicrobial resistance is 

essential for providing information on the magnitude of, and trends in, resistance, and to plan and 

monitor the effect of targeted interventions.  

 

In Argentina, the National Zoonotic Disease Control Program of the Ministry of Health, 

created  in  2011,  has  incorporated  salmonellosis  into  the  main  zoonotic  diseases  of  the  country 

(Ministry of Health, 2011). Different studies in this country show the importance of Salmonella 

ser.  Enteritidis  (SE)  and  S.  ser.  Typhimurium  (ST)  in  child  and  adult  gastroenteritis  (Mancini, 

2013,Torres, Sánchez & González ., 2016). No studies have yet been conducted on chicken livers 

in Argentina, identifying Salmonella prevalence and serovars and their antibiotic resistant profile. 

Therefore, the present work was conducted to 1) estimate the apparent prevalence of Salmonella 

spp.  on  chicken  livers  obtained  from  markets  in  Entre  Ríos,  Argentina,  using  two  culture

methods,  2)  evaluate  the  performance  of  two  culture  methods  and  selective-differential  plating 

media used for Salmonella isolation, and 3) determine the antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella 

isolated from chicken liver.  

 

2. Materials and Methods 

 

2.1. Sampling 

 

Since  no  previous  studies  had  been  performed,  a  sample  size  of  666  chicken  livers  was 

determined, with an absolute error of 5%, a 99% confidence level, and an expected prevalence of

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

 

50%. Frozen chicken livers or giblets were collected from different retail markets associated with 

9  poultry  slaughter  companies  in  3  counties  (Colón,  Gualeguaychú,  Uruguay)  of  Entre  Rios, 

Argentina,  between  October  2015  and  May  2016.  Samples  were  labeled  and  transported  in  ice 

chests  to  the  INTA  Laboratory  of  Poultry  Health  (Concepción  del  Uruguay,  Entre  Ríos)  for 

Salmonella sp. culture. 

 

 

2.2. Salmonella spp. isolation and identification 

Frozen chicken livers and giblets were thawed either in the refrigerator (2-8°C)  for 18-24 

hours or at room temperature (22-25ºC) for 4 to 5 hours before analysis. In the case of the giblets, 

the  liver  was  separated  from  the  heart,  gizzard  and  neck  using  sterile  procedures.  Aseptic 

techniques were followed for all steps to avoid contamination. Once thawed, the imprint (direct 

selective  agar  plating)  method  was  used  for  Salmonella  isolation  by  direct  pressure  of  the  cut 

surface of a liver sample onto  MacConkey agar (MCA; Acumedia, Michigan, US) and modified 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

lysine iron agar (MLIA). The plates were streaked with a sterile loop, then incubated  at 35 ± 2ºC 

for 18-24 h. The composition of MLIA (g/l) was lysine iron agar 34.5 g (Acumedia), bile salt N°3 

1.5 g (Britania, Buenos Aires, Argentina), lactose 10 g (Anedra, Holland), sucrose 10 g (Biopack, 

Buenos Aires, Argentina), sodium thiosulfate 6.76 g (Biopack), and ferric ammonium citrate 0.3 

g (Carlo Erba, Milano, Italy). If there was no bacterial growth, the plates were then reincubated 

for a total time of 48 hours.  Additionally, 1- 2 g of each liver was weighed separately and placed 

in a sterile tube, in which buffered peptone water (Acumedia) was added 1:10 (weight/volume), 

homogenized using a vortex mixer and then incubated at  35± 2°C for 18-  24 h. (preenrichment 

method).  One  milliliter  of  incubated  broth  was  then  transferred  to  10  mL  of  tetrathionate  broth 

base  (Acumedia),  in  addition  to  20  mL/L  of  iodine  potassium  iodide  solution  (6  g  of  iodine  -

demineralized  water),  brilliant  green  0.1%  (Sigma,  Steinheim,  Germany),  and  40  mg/mL  of 

novobiocin  (Sigma),  and  incubated  at  35  ±  2°C  for  18-24  h.    Afterwards,  a  loopful  of 

tetrathionate broth was streaked on MCA (Acumedia) and MLIA, and incubated at 35 ± 2°C for 

18-24  h.  Following  the  same  procedure,  if  there  was  no  bacterial  growth  the  plates  were  then 

reincubated for a total time of 48 hours.  

Two  presumed  Salmonella  colonies  on  each  selective-differential  agar  plate  were 

biochemically  confirmed  using  triple-sugar  iron  agar  (Britania),  lysine  iron  agar  (Acumedia), 

Simmons  citrate  (Oxoid,  Basingtoke,  UK),  sulfide  indole  motility  medium  (Britania), 

phenylalanine agar (Hi-Media, Bombay, India) and ortho-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside (ONPG) test 

(Britania).  All  Salmonella  isolations  were  preserved  on  nutritive  (Acumedia)  slant  agar  until 

serotyping,  which  was  carried  out  according  to  the  White-Kauffmann-Le  Minor  scheme,  using 

somatic  (AgO)  and  flagellar  (AgH)  antigens  (Grimont  &Weill,  2007).  A  liver  was  considered 

positive  to  Salmonella  sp.  when  this  bacterium  was  isolated  from  at  least  one  colony  on  a

sample where Salmonella sp. is detected in at least one differential selective agar.  Relative true 

negative  is  defined  as  a  sample  where  Salmonella  spp.  was  not  detected  in  any  differential-

selective agar. Kappa coefficients were summarized, according to Dawson and Trap (2004),  as 

excellent agreement (0.93 to 1.00), very good agreement (0.81 to 0.92), good agreement (0.61 to 

0.80),  fair  agreement  (0.41  to  0.60),  slight  agreement  (0.21  to  0.40),  poor  agreement  (0.01  to 

0.20),  and  no  agreement  (<0.01).  McNemar's  test  was  calculated  using  a  chi-square

The antibiotic susceptibility test was performed  by the standard disk  diffusion method 

using  Mueller-Hinton  agar  (DifcoTM,  Sparks,  MD,  USA)  and  the  results  were  interpreted  in 

accordance with the criteria of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (2013, 

2015). The isolates were screened for resistance  to  the following  antibiotics: amikacin  (30 µg); 

ampicillin  (10  µg);  amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid  (30  µg);  fosfomycin  (50  µg);  colistin  (10  µg); 

tetracycline (30 µg); florfenicol (30 µg); enrofloxacin (10 µg); gentamicin (10 µg); erythromycin 

(15  µg);    suphamethoxazole/trimethoprim  (25  µg);  doxycycline  (30  µg);  neomycin  (30  µg); 

cephalothin (30 µg); norfloxacin (10 µg); amoxicillin (10 µg); kanamycin (30 µg); ciprofloxacin 

(5  µg);    cefixime  (5  µg);  cefotaxime  (30  µg);  cefoxitin  (30  µg);  ceftazidime  (30  µg);  

chloramphenicol  (30  µg);  imipenem  (10  µg),  nalidixic  acid  (30  µg),  streptomycin  (10  µg), 

tigecycline  (15  µg),  azithromycin  (15  µg),  cefpodoxime  (19  µg);    and  fosfomycin/tylosin  (160 

µg/40  µg).    All  the  antibiotic  disks  except  fosfomycin/tylosin  (FOSBAC  PLUS  T-BEDSONTM,

Britania) were purchased from Oxoid. The zone diameter breakpoint used for fosfomycin/tylosin 

was the same as fosfomycin.  

 

3. Results 

3.1.  Apparent  prevalence  of  Salmonella  in  chicken  liver  obtained  from  markets  in  Entre  Ríos, 

Argentina. 

Of the 666 poultry livers studied by two culture methods, 32 organs (4.8%) positive for 

Salmonella  sp.  were  from  4  poultry  slaughterhouse  companies.    Salmonella  sp  was  detected  in 

either one or two culture methods. However, 24  Salmonella  sp. positive samples were found in 

liver obtained from markets associated with one chicken slaughterhouse company (Table 1).  

Fifty Salmonella strains were isolated from the positive liver samples and were typed into 

3  serovars:  S.  ser.  Schwarzengrund  (78%),  SE  (18%),  and  ST  (4%).  Forty-seven    strains  were 

isolated from preenrichment and 3 strains from direct selective agar plating method.  More than 

one Salmonella serovar  was found in  livers from  two chicken slaughterhouse companies,  while 

only  one  serovar  was  found  in  livers  from  the  other  two  chicken  slaughterhouse  companies

(Table 2).   

 

 

3.2. Performance of two Salmonella culture methods and selective-differential plating  

Because of the absence of false positive samples, the RSp  and RPPV for the two culture 

methods and the two plating media in preenrichment method and MLIA in  direct selective agar 

plating method was 1. However, no samples were positive for Salmonella sp using MCA in direct 

selective  agar  plating  method,  so  RSp  was  1,  and  RPPV  was  indeterminate  for  this  media  and 

method.  

 

10 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

 

Overall,  32  (4.80%)  and  3  (0.45%)  of  the  666  chicken  liver  samples  were  positive  for 

Salmonella  sp.  in  the  preenrichment  method  and  direct  selective  agar  plating  method, 

respectively;  these  percentages  were  significantly  different  (P  ˂  0.05).  Although  the  three  liver 

samples, which were  Salmonella sp. positive by  direct  selective agar plating  method, were also 

positive by the preenrichment method, the agreement between the two methods was poor. There 

was  also  a  statistical  difference  in  RAc,  RSe  and  RNPV  between  preenrichment  method  and 

direct selective agar plating method. Preenrichment had greater values for these parameters than 

the direct selective agar plating method (Table 3).  

The  results  of  RAc,  RSe,  RNPV  and  the  agreement  (McNemar's  test  and  Kappa 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

coefficient)  calculation  for  the  selective-differential  media  in  the  two  culture  methods  used  are 

shown in Table 4. RAc, RSe and RNPV were statistically different between MCA and MLIA in 

the two culture methods; the second had greater values for these parameters than MCA for both 

culture  methods.  Overall,  15  (2.25%)  and  32  (4.80%)  samples  yielded  Salmonella  sp.  on  MCA 

and MLIA for preenrichment method, respectively; these percentages were significantly different 

(P˂  0.05).  Since  15  liver  samples  were  Salmonella  sp.  positive  by  MCA  and  MLIA,  the 

agreement between the two methods was good. On the other hand, overall 0 (0%) and 3 (0.45%) 

samples  yielded  Salmonella  sp.  on  MCA  and  MLIA  for  direct  selective  agar  plating  method, 

respectively;  these  percentages  were  not  significantly  different  (P  >0.05)  and  there  was  no 

agreement between MCA and MLIA. 

 

3.3. Antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella isolated from chicken liver  

 

From  50  Salmonella  isolates  studied,  all  strains  were  susceptible  to  all  antibiotics  tested 

with  the  exception  of  erythromycin  and  streptomycin.  All  Salmonella  strains  were  resistant  to 

11 

 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

 

erythromycin,  and  only  11  isolates  (22%),  which  belong  to  S.  Schwazengrund,  showed  an 

intermediate sensitivity to streptomycin.  

 

4. Discussion 

In  the  present  study,  666  samples  of  chicken  liver  were  acquired  from  different  retail 

markets  in  order  to  calculate  the  Salmonella  spp.  prevalence.  There  is  no  previously  published 

data  for  the  apparent  prevalence  of  Salmonella  sp.  in  chicken  livers  from  Entre  Rios  and 

Argentina. The study revealed a prevalence rate of 4.8%. It is known that the microbial status of 

offal, such as livers, is an indicator of slaughterhouse hygiene practices  (Kramer, Frost, Bolton, 

&  Wareing,  2000).  Varying  Salmonella  sp.  incidence  rates  in  chicken  livers  (Molla  &Mesfin, 

2003; Rodrigo, Adesiyun, Asgarali, & Swanston,  2006; Abdellah, Fouzia, Abdelkader, Rachida 

&  Mouloud,  2009;  El-Aziz,  2013)  were  reported  between  1%  and  40.0%  in  other  countries 

(Morocco, Ethiopia, Egypt and Trinidad). The variation of Salmonella contamination in chicken 

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

livers can be due to differences in sampling techniques, number of samples studied, distribution 

of  salmonellae  in  a  lot  examined,  the  detection  methods  employed,  and  cross-contamination 

during production, processing, distribution and retail marketing (Abu-Ruwaida, Sawaya, Dashti, 

Murad,  &  Al-Othman,  1994;  Bryan  &Doyle,  1995;  Dominguez,  Gomenz  &  Zumalacarregui, 

2002; Harrison,  Griffith, Tennant  & Peters,  2001; Rusul, Khair, Radu, Cheah  & Yassin,   1996; 

Russell & Walker, 1997; Uyttendaele, Debevere, Lips & Neyts, 1998).  

Our study identified three serovars found in chicken liver: S. ser. Schwarzengrund, SE and 

ST;  the  first  being  the  most  prevalent  serotype.  Other  studies  related  to  chicken  livers  from 

giblets found ST, S. ser. Braenderup, S. ser. Kiambu, S. ser. Newport, S. ser. Montevideo and/or 

S.  ser.  Heidelberg  (Molla  &Mesfin,  2003;  Rodrigo,  Adesiyun,  Asgarali,  &  Swanston,  2006

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

 

Abdellah,  Fouzia,  Abdelkader,  Rachida  &  Mouloud,  2009;  El-Aziz,  2013).  S.  ser. 

Schwarzengrund  has  been  isolated  from  infectious  in  human  and  from  animal  sources 

(Bangtrakulnonth et al., 2004; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013; ). This serovar 

is frequently associated with poultry production such as chickens (Chen, Hwang, Wang, Shih & 

Tsen, 2011), and laying hens (Poppe, Irwin, Messier, Finley, & Oggel, 1991, Soria et al. 2017). 

On the other hand, the isolation of ST and SE in our study indicates the public health significance 

of  these  serovar  in  contaminated  chicken  meat  and  meat  products.  This  risk  may  be  high  if 

chicken meat or giblets are consumed undercooked or there is cross-contamination in the kitchen 

with  Salmonella  during  meal  preparation  (D’Aoust,  1989;  Scott,  1996;  Uyttendaele,  Debevere, 

Lips & Neyts,1998).

clones  or  resistance  genes  and  diminishing  efficacy  of  some  antimicrobial  classes  recently 

introduced into medical and veterinary practice (Chiu et al., 2002; Wray & Wray, 2000). Most of 

the trends were not identified in the present study, where all Salmonella isolates were only found 

to  be  resistant  to  erythromycin.  Similar  results  were  reported  for  SE  and  ST  isolated  from  raw 

chicken  meat  at  retail  markets  (Thung  et  al.,  2016).  Resistance  to  erythromycin  (macrolide 

antimicrobials,  can  be  frequently  encountered  and  may  reduce  the  effectiveness  of  treatments 

(Frye  &Fedorka-Cray,  2007).    In  reference  of  antibiotic  resistance  in  Salmonella,  it  is  focused 

antibiotic) and penicillin has been reported as the most common resistance profile in retail meat 

products  (Sallam,  Mohammed,  Hassan,  &  Tamura,  2014).  Although,  this  could  be  due  to 

improper usage or overuse of a particular  antimicrobial causing resistance to occur, it is known 

that  Gram-negative  bacilli,  as  Salmonella  sp.,  are  usually  intrinsically  resistant  to  macrolide

antibiotics  (Chambers,  2006;  Nakajima,  1999).  On  the  other  hand,  low  levels  of  intermediate 

resistances  to  streptomycin  (22%)  were  observed.  Similar  results  were  reported  for  SE  and  ST 

strains recovered from retail chicken meats (Yang et al., 2010; Thung et al., 2016). 

In  reference  to  detection  method,  the  relative  effectiveness  of  two  culture  methods  and 

differential-selective  agars  for  the  recovery  of  Salmonella  sp.  from  naturally  contaminated 

chicken  liver  was  compared  in  this  work.  We  found  a  poor  agreement  between  the  two  culture 

methods,  and  that  the  preenrichment  method  has  a  higher  RSe,  RAc  and  RNPV  than  a  direct 

selective  agar  plating  method.  Although  Valentin-Bon,  Brackett,  Seo,  Hammack  and  Andrews 

(2003)  used  different  selective  plating  media;  they  found  that  preenrichment  method  provided 

greater  sensitivity  for  SE  isolation  in  contaminated  egg  slurries  than  the  direct  selective  agar 

plating  method.  It  is  well  known  that  pathogens  have  to  compete  with  indigenous  microflora, 

which  can  interfere  at  the  time  of  testing.  Sequential  enrichment  in  nonselective  and  selective 

media allows enhancing  detection, recovery of sublethally injured  Salmonella and also  increase

the number of cells (van Schothorst &van Leusden 1975; Chen, Anantheswaran & Knabel, 2001; 

Stephenson,  Satchell,  Allen  &  Andrews,  1991).  Salmonella  can  be  present  in  chicken  liver  in 

such  small  numbers  that  they  cannot  be  detected  by  the  direct  method.  Furthermore,  the 

preenrichment  method  studied  the  presence  of  Salmonella  sp.  in  the  entire  organ  (internal  and 

external),  while  the  direct  method  studied  only  considers  the  internal  part  of  livers.  The  results 

reported  here  are  consistent  with  those  studies  regarding  the  use  of  preenrichment  and  direct 

enrichment  for  the  recovery  of  foodborne  pathogens  (D’Aoust  Sewell  &  Warburton,  1992; 

Hammack,  Amaguaña,  June,  Sherrod,  &  Andrews,  1999;  Powrie  &  Nakai,  1986;  Stephenson, 

Satchell, Allen & Andrews, 1991).

Media  for  efficient  isolation  of  salmonellae  should  be  selective  and  have  a  reliable 

indicator system to reveal the presence of Salmonella colonies. These properties should be stable 

during the time of storage and use of the media (Rappold & Bolderdijk, 1979). In this work, best 

results  were  obtained  with  MLIA.  Edwards  and  Fife  (1961)  introduced  this  medium  to  detect 

lysine  decarboxylation  and  H2S  production  of  Arizona  spp.  Novobiocin,  bile  salts,  lactose,  and 

sucrose  were  added  to  enhance  the  selectivity  and  differentiation  capacity  of  lysine  iron  agar. 

Differentiation of Enterobacteriaceae on MLIA is based on a color change from purple to yellow 

if lysine is not decarboxylated and lactose or sucrose or both are fermented. Typical salmonellae 

decarboxylate  lysine  and  do  not  ferment  lactose  or  sucrose;  the  purple  color  of  the  medium  is

maintained.  H2S-positive  salmonellae  grow  with  black  centered  colonies.  The  United  States 

Department of Agriculture (USDA) lists DMLIA as  part of the differentiation and confirmation 

Salmonella  sp.  steps  starting  with  streaking  to  Brilliant  Green  Sulfa  agar  and  either  DMLIA  or 

Xylose- Lysine Tergitol™ 4 agar (United States Department of Agriculture, 2017). Rappold and 

Bolderdijk  (1979)  found  that  MLIA  increased  Salmonella  sp.  isolation  from  mixed  cultures  of 

different  Enterobacteriaceae  compare  to  other  selective  plating  media  (Brilliant  Green  agar, 

Deoxycholate Lactose agar, Salmonella-Shigella agar, Hektoen Enteric Agar, and Xylose- Lysine 

Deoxycholate agar). 

 

5. Conclusion 

This  study  shows  that,  although  serovars  that  have  importance  in  public  health  were 

isolated,  the  prevalence  of  Salmonella  sp.  is  low  in  chicken  livers  from  Entre  Rios,  Argentina. 

Due  to  all  Salmonella  strains  were  susceptible  to  most  antibiotics  tested  with  the  exception  of 

erythromycin,  multi-resistance  is  not  a  problem  in  theses  strains,  but  it  is  inadvisable  to  use

erythromycin  to  treat  salmonellosis.  Furthermore,  the  preenrichment  method  and  MLIA  are 

superior to the direct selective agar plating method and MCA for the recovery of Salmonella sp. 

from chicken liver samples, respectively.

Highlights 

-The prevalence of Salmonella sp. is low in chicken livers from Entre Rios, Argentina.  

- Multi-resistance is not a problem in Salmonella strains isolated from chicken livers. 

- The preenrichment method is superior to the direct selective plating method. 

-The MLIA is superior to MCA for Salmonella sp. isolation from chicken liver.
