Abstract

Aim : To find out the organisms causing endometritis in cattle and to determine their in vitro sensitivity to various antibiotics
Materials and methods: Thirty uterine secretion samples, 9 from Holstein Friesian and 21 from Jersey cows were collected in 
and around Namakkal district of Tamil Nadu from clinical cases of endometritis. The bacteria isolated both aerobically and 
anaerobically from endometritis showed the characteristic colony, were gram stained and confirmed by standard biochemical 
tests. The invitro antibiotic sensitivity test with different antibiotic discs were carried out.
Results and Discussion: Out of 30 samples, 25 contained different strains of bacteria and 5 were found bacteriologically 
sterile. Different species of bacteria isolated from these samples were, Escherichia coli (36.66%), Klebsiella spp (30%), 
Proteus spp (13.33%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.66%), Clostridium spp (3.33%). The in vitro antibiotic sensitivity test 
indicated that the highest number of isolates (64%) were sensitive to Ceftriaxone, followed by Gentamicin, Enrofloxacin and 
Chlortetracycline (32%). Chloramphenicol showed sensitivity in minimum number (8%) of isolates. 
Conclusion : This study revealed that the bacteria E.coli and Klebisella spp are more commonly isolated in endometritis in 
cows and the drug Ceftriaxone is highly effective.

Introduction

Metritis and endometritis are inflammation of the 
uterus.  Metritis  involves  the  endometrium,  the 
underling  glandular  tissues  and  the  muscular  layer 
[1,2]. While, endometritis, is involves only the endo-
metrium  with  the  underlying  glandular  tissues  [3], 
without any systemic signs [4]. Bacteriological conta-
minations of the uterus after parturition and metabolic 
changes in the transition period are important etiological 
factors for the occurrence of metritis and endometritis 
[5]. Endometritis is one of the most common reproductive 
disorder of buffaloes and cows. This problem not only 
affects  milk  yield  but  also  decreases  reproductive 
efficiency [6,7]. It is the main health problem in high 
producing  cows  [8,  9].  Subclinical  endometritis  has 
been implicated as the most common cause of failure of  Materials and Methods
conception in a high percentage of bovines in India 
[10].  Muneer  et.  al.  [11]  reported  18.20  per  cent  of 
incidence  of  endometritis  in  in  Frieswal  crossbred 
cows in Hyderabad. Postpartum bacterial endometritis 
is the most common cause of infertility in cows as it 
delays uterine involution, prolongs the time until first 
estrus, increases the number of services per conception, 
and thus prolongs the interval to calving [12]. Bacterial 
isolation has been reported from uterine secretions of 
cows suffering from endometritis [13]. A wide variety 
of bacteria has been recovered from uteri of postpartum 
cows. Most prevalent pathogens involved in the etiology

of endometritis are Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Escherichia 
coli, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Prevotella species 
[14,15]. Besides Actinomyces pvogenes, Gram-negative 
anaerobic  bacteria  like  Fusobacterium  necrophorum 
and Bacteroides spp may have an important role in the 
pathogenesis of endometritis [11]. Frazier et. al. [16] 
reported endometritis in postparturient cattle associated 
with bovine herpesvirus-4 infection.The infections of 
uterus caused by bacteria are treated with antibiotics. 
However, the efficacy of such therapeutic agents needs 
to be evaluated from time to time due to continuous 
emergence of drug resistant bacterial strains.

Objectives  of  this  study  were,  to  find  out  the 
organisms causing endometritis in cattle and to determine 
their in vitro sensitivity to various antibiotics.

Thirty uterine secretion samples, 9 from Holstein 
Friesian and 21 from Jersey cows were collected in and 
around Namakkal district of Tamil Nadu from clinical 
cases  of  endometritis.  Immediately  after  collection, 
sterile nutrient broth was added to each sample and 
incubated at 37 C for over night. These samples were 
inoculated  by  streaking  method  on  blood  agar,  Mac 
Conkey agar and Nutrient agar. The inoculated media 
were  incubated,  both  under  aerobic  and  anaerobic 
conditions, at 37  C and examined after every 12 hours 
till 48 hours post inoculation for the presence of any
