Objective: To study the occurrence and serotype diversity of Salmonella isolates in
different species of poultry (chicken, emu and duck) and determine their resistance
pattern against various antibiotics of different classes.
Methods: About 507 samples comprising 202 caecal contents and 305 fecal samples from
chicken, emu and duck were processed for isolation of Salmonella enterica. Salmonellae were
isolated and detected by standard protocol of ISO 6579 Amendment 1: Annex D. Genetic
conÔ¨Årmation was also made by using 16S rRNA genus speciÔ¨Åc PCR. Serotype speciÔ¨Åc PCR
was also done to detect the most common serovars viz. Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella
Typhimurium and Salmonella Gallinarum. All obtained isolates were subjected to a set of 25
antibiotics to study their antibiogram by using Baeur‚ÄìKirby disk diffusion method.
Results: Out of 507 samples processed, 32 isolates of Salmonella enterica (18 from
caecal contents and 14 from faecal samples) were obtained, of which 24 belonged to 6
different serovars, 6 were untypeable and 2 were rough strains. Salmonella Enteritidis
was the most predominant serotype (9), followed by Salmonella Typhimurium (5),
Salmonella Virchow (4), Salmonella Gallinarum (3), Salmonella Reading (2) and Sal-
monella Altona (1). Antibiotic resistance pattern was maximum (100%) to oxacillin,
penicillin and clindamycin, followed by ampicillin (68.75%), tetracycline (65.62%),
nalidixic acid (56.25%) and colistin (46.87%). High sensitivity of isolates was recorded
for chloramphenicol (96.87%) followed by meropenem (84.37%).
Conclusions: Occurrence of high proportion of serovars in our study which can cause
serious gastroenteritis in humans is a matter of concern. Salmonella Altona has been detected
for the Ô¨Årst time in India from poultry. This serotype is known to cause serious outbreaks of
gastroenteritis in humans. Multidrug resistant isolates were recovered at high percentage
which can be attributed to non-judicious use of antibiotics both in prophylaxis and treatment
regimen. This observation draws serious attention as poultry serves as an important source of
transmission of these multidrug resistant Salmonella serovars to humans.

Salmonellosis in poultry is an important area of study as it not
only affects the poultry industry but can also occur in humans
by consumption of contaminated poultry meat and eggs [3].
Poultry comprises
species which include
chickens, ducks and emus. Salmonellosis has been endemic in
poultry industry of India [4]. Several researchers have reported
variable prevalence rates of Salmonella infection in different
parts of India [5,6]. Diverse number of serovars of Salmonella

Typhimurium),
and
Salmonella Newport are important nontyphoidal causes of
human salmonellosis caused by consumption of contaminated
poultry products. Salmonella Gallinarum (S. Gallinarum) and
Salmonella Pullorum are the only two host-speciÔ¨Åc true patho-
gens of poultry birds and they affect the poultry industry to a
great extent resulting in huge economic losses in terms of
morbidity and mortality. Isolation and identiÔ¨Åcation of Salmo-
nella are very tedious and take several days before coming to the
Ô¨Ånal conclusion. There has been great demand in terms of quick
and sensitive detection of Salmonella from poultry in order to
take timely therapeutic and prophylactic measures. Several PCR-
based assays have been developed for rapid detection of Sal-
monella sp. [8,9]. Various serotype-speciÔ¨Åc PCR have also been
developed for some common serovars to reduce time and cost in
processing isolates by conventional serotyping which is very
much labor intensive and time-consuming [10].

In the past few decades, emergence of antibiotic resistance
among different species of bacteria was on the rise [11]. This
problem poses great
to public health in case of
zoonotically important bacteria transmitted from food animals.
In this context, contaminated poultry products serve as an
important threat to public health as it is an important reservoir
of
as growth
promoters in poultry is an important factor that has favored
the selection of resistant bacteria in fecal microÔ¨Çora of poultry
[12].These resistant strains are easily passed to human through
food chains resulting in serious consequences in terms of
treatment failure and rapid outbreaks of resistant salmonellae.

in suggesting proper and effective therapeutic measures.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sampling

A total of 507 samples comprising 305 fecal samples and 202
caecal contents from different species of poultry (Table 1) were
collected from March 2013 to August 2014. Freshly voided fecal
samples were collected in sufÔ¨Åcient amount in sterile test tubes
by cotton swabs while caecal contents were taken from various
slaughtered birds and transferred to laboratory as soon as
possible on ice.

2.2. Isolation

Samples were homogenized in sterile phosphate buffer solution
(pH 7.2) by stirrer to avoid contamination. Homogenized samples
were centrifuged at 1500 r/min for 15 min to settle the coarse fecal

matter. Supernatant was taken in fresh sterile tube to process ac-
cording to guidelines of standard revised protocol for Salmonella
isolation ISO 6579 Amendment 1: Annex D [13]. However, due to
the limitation of this protocol in detection of only motile serovars,
we also processed samples in less inhibitory selective broth of
selenite cystine for recovery of nonmotile serovars. The protocol
involved initial enrichment of supernatant in buffered peptone
water (1:10) for 16 h at 37
C. Three drops of each pre-enriched
samples were placed separately on modiÔ¨Åed semi
solid
Rappaport-Vassiliadis (MSRV) agar and incubated at 41.5
C for
24 h. After incubation, plates were observed for production of grey-
white, turbid zone extending from point of inoculation (Figure 1). A
loopful of culture was taken from the border of the opaque zone
formed on MSRV and streaked on xylose lysine deoxycholate agar
and Hektoen enteric agar. Plates were incubated at 37
C for 24 h
and observed for typical colonies of Salmonella. For detection of
nonmotile Salmonella, pre-enriched samples were inoculated in
selenite cystine broth and incubated at 37
C for 24 h. Selective
plating was done similarly to above. All suspected colonies were
puriÔ¨Åed and preserved on nutrient agar slants.

2.3. Biochemical characterisation

All suspected colonies were subjected to different biochem-
ical tests by HiSalmonella‚Ñ¢ identiÔ¨Åcation kit (Himedia, Mum-
bai, India). The kit contained 12 biochemical tests viz. methyl
red, Voges‚ÄìProskauer, urease, hydrogen sulphide production,
citrate utilization, lysine, o-nitrophenyl b-galactoside, lactose,
arabinose, maltose, sorbitol and dulcitol. Also, isolates were
inoculated in triple sugar iron agar slants to observe the triple
sugar iron reaction.

2.4. Latex agglutination test

All suspected colonies were subjected to polyvalent latex
for preliminary identiÔ¨Åcation by using

serotype-speciÔ¨Åc PCR

Primers targeting genus speciÔ¨Åc region of 16S rRNA gene of
Salmonella enterica (S. enterica) were used following protocol
of Lin and Tsen [14]. All the isolates of Salmonella were referred
to the National Centre on Serotyping of Salmonella, Indian
Veterinary Research Institute, Uttar Pradesh, India, for Ô¨Ånal
conÔ¨Årmation and serotyping. Serotype-speciÔ¨Åc PCR was also
used for speciÔ¨Åc identiÔ¨Åcation of S. Enteritidis and S. Typhi-
murium by following protocol of Alvarez et al. [15] while S.
Gallinarum was detected by using allele-speciÔ¨Åc PCR devel-
oped by Shah et al.
[16] with little modiÔ¨Åcations. The PCR

rough strains. Serotyping report showed that 9 isolates belonged
to S. Enteritidis, 5 of S. Typhimurium, 4 of S. Virchow, 3 of S.
Gallinarum, 2 of Salmonella Reading (S. Reading) and 1 isolate
belonged to Salmonella Altona (S. Altona). All
the isolates
showed agglutination reaction in latex agglutination test except
rough and S. Gallinarum strains (Figure 2).

The detailed distribution of isolates from different poultry
species is presented in Table 3. The biochemical reactions
showed similar results for all serovars except for S. Gallinarum
which was negative for citrate production and S. Virchow iso-
lates which were exclusively negative for dulcitol fermentation.
Besides, there was considerable variability in citrate utilization,
sugar
fermentation and hydrogen sulphide production in
untypable strains. Also, S. Gallinarum isolates were found
weakly positive for production of hydrogen sulphide and it was
observed that rough strains produced initially little amount of
hydrogen sulphide after 24 h of incubation which increased
considerably after 48 h. All the isolates showed alkaline slant,
acidic butt with blackish discolouration, pale colonies on Mac-
Conkey's agar and pink round with black centered colonies on

4. Discussion

Salmonellosis is one of the major bacterial diseases trans-
mitted from food animals. Every year, millions of salmonellosis
cases are reported worldwide [19]. In US alone, salmonellosis is
one of the most common diseases among food-borne diseases
accounting for 800 000 to 4 000 000 human infections annually
[20]. Salmonella not only poses serious threat to public health but
also causes huge economic losses by generating mortality and
morbidity to poultry industry. Monitoring and control are two
important aspects to reduce the prevalence at farm level of this
zoonotic disease. In the present study, a prevalence rate of
6.31% was recorded which is very similar to the Ô¨Åndings of Mir
et al. who reported an overall prevalence of 6.88% in Kashmir
Valley, India [21]. However, the prevalence rate was lower than
that in other studies conducted in other parts of India [22,23].
This could be due to bias in sample taking in their studies while
we collected samples randomly rather than sampling from only
suspected ill birds. It is worth to mention here that the success
of detection depends not only on choice of sampling but also on
the sensitivity of culture method. Besides, intermittent shedding
and non-uniform distribution in poultry houses may also be
responsible for variability in results [24]. Therefore, there are
always possibilities for
the high variability in results of
detection rates by different workers. The present study used ISO
6539 Annex D protocol and found it highly accurate and speciÔ¨Åc
in detection without any false positives. Many false positives
were encountered while nonmotile sensitive serovars were
isolated by direct enrichment in selenite cystine broth. This may
be either due to the development of resistance against inhibitory

effect of selenite by competing bacteria or more contaminated
samples. This draws attention in improving method for better
isolation of sensitive serovars without extra workload in
processing false positives [25].

The serotyping results showed that majority of isolates
belonged to S. Enteritidis. Infections due to S. Enteritidis have
been a major cause of food-borne salmonellosis over the last few
decades worldwide [26,27]. However, few reports are available of
human infections in India due to S. Enteritidis [28]. Yet, the high
occurrence of S. Enteritidis in our study has raised a serious
public health concern and needs
strict monitoring and
surveillance. Similar observations had been reported by Suresh
et al. who recovered S. Enteritidis
in high proportion
compared to other serovars from various poultry products [29].
The other serovars isolated in the study of S. Typhimurium, S.
Virchow, S. Reading and S. Altona have also been implicated
in non-typhoidal salmonellosis and have important public
health signiÔ¨Åcance. S. Reading and S. Altona have been asso-
ciated with several sporadic outbreaks of food-borne salmonel-
losis in humans [30,31]. To the best of author's knowledge and
records available in literature, S. Altona has not been reported
earlier in India. S. Gallinarum, a host-adapted serotype, was
only recovered from caecal contents. This observation suggests
that the serotype is poorly shed in fecal matter compared to other
serotypes. S. Gallinarum has been responsible for severe eco-
nomic losses in terms of morbidity and mortality. Majority of the
serotypes recovered in the study are capable to cause serious
gastroenteritis in humans except for S. Gallinarum [32]. Poultry
act as an important
source in transmission of various
zoonotically important serotypes of Salmonella through food
chains to humans [32]. Therefore, this study shows a serious
need of quality check and surveillance programmes in order to
reduce the risk of salmonellosis.

Non-judicious usage of antibiotics for therapeutic purpose or
as growth promoters in poultry industry has led to selective
pressure on various bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella
serovars; Enterococcus spp., Clostridium perfringens) resulting
in emergence of multidrug resistant strains which is a matter of
serious concern for public health [33,34]. Infections due to such
strains are very difÔ¨Åcult
study,
antibiogram results revealed high resistance to beta-lactam an-
tibiotics (oxacillin, penicillin, ampicillin) and clindamycin fol-
lowed by colistin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline. Diarra et al.
reported in their study the similar pattern of resistance against
beta-lactam antibiotics like ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic
acid,
[35]. Growing
resistance towards beta-lactam antibiotics has been prevalent
worldwide among members of Enterobacteriaceae from animal
origin, especially in Salmonella sp. [36]. This has been associated
with various antibiotic resistant gene determinants like ampC,
blaCMY-1, blaCMY-2, blaCTX-M, and blaTEM [37,38]. Resistance to
cephalosporins was variable in contrast
to the Ô¨Ånding of
Elhadi who did not found any resistance to any cephalosporins
used in the study [39]. This can be due to variation in source
as they isolated Salmonella sp. from freshwater Ô¨Åsh which are
not exposed to antibiotic pressure compared to poultry. The
resistance

study resistant to clindamycin [40]. The results of colistin are

brane [42]. Level of resistance against nalidixic acid was very
much in agreement to the Ô¨Åndings of Halimi et al., who found
53% of their Salmonella isolates resistant to nalidixic acid [43].
However, Campioni et al. have reported more resistance to
nalidixic acid compared to our observation which can be
explained due to high level of exposure of poultry to drug
used in study [44]. Nalidixic acid is a quinolone drug and
resistance associated with it has been due to various point
mutations in DNA gyrase enzyme where the drug acts [45].
Resistance to tetracycline was comparable to Ô¨Åndings of
Akbar and Ana [46] but less than that of Ellerboek et al. [47]
who reported 100% resistance in their study. Resistance to
tetracycline has been attributed to irrational usage of it as
growth promoter in poultry feed. In the recent past years, the
use of tetracycline has been limited in food animals which
explain the change in pattern of resistance. High sensitivity to
chloramphenicol was similar to that of Elmadiena et al. who
also found majority of their Salmonella isolates sensitive to
chloramphenicol [48]. Also, high susceptibility of isolates to
meropenem was in agreement to results of Tang et al. who
found meropenem a good therapeutic option in testing various
multidrug resistant Salmonella isolates [49].

Thus, it is mandatory to implement strict control over abuse
of antibiotics particularly in food animals. Proper scientiÔ¨Åc and
public health regulations are needed to scrutinize non-judicial
usage of antibiotics. Also, any treatment regimen should be
followed after conducting in vitro antibiotic susceptibility
testing. That will reduce the emergence of microbial bugs which
are spreading worldwide and responsible for
fatal disease
outcome in different parts of world [50].
