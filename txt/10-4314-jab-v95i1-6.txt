ABSTRACT 
Objectives:  The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  determine  the  prevalence  and  antibiotic  resistance  profile  of 
Salmonella enterica isolated from raw beef, mutton and intestines sold in Ouagadougou; Burkina Faso. 
Methodology and Results: A total of 450 samples from raw meat of beef (n=175), mutton (n=175), beef intestine 
(n=50) and sheep intestine (n=50) were analyzed using standards microbiological method for the detection of 
Salmonella. The isolates were tested for antibacterial resistance using the agar diffusion method with fourteen 
commonly used antibiotics. In this study, Salmonella contaminated 19% (86/450) of the samples with 27% 
(47/175) of beef, 18% (9/50) of beef intestine, 11% (19/175) of mutton and 22% (11/50) of sheep intestine. 
Salmonella strains isolates were most resistant to tetracycline and cefalotin than other tested antibiotics.  
Conclusion and main findings: The high rate of Salmonella strains in animals can pose a major public health 
risk in Burkina Faso. In addition, the susceptibility test confirms the circulation of antibiotic resistant pathogens 
in  raw  meat.  Interestingly,  these  findings  indicate  a  presence  of  multiresistant  strains.  The  regulation  of 
antibiotics use in animal husbandry is recommended to prevent antibiotic resistance in humans. 
Key words: Beef, Mutton, Raw Intestine, Salmonella, Antimicrobial Susceptibility, Burkina Faso. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Microbial  food  safety  is  an  increasing  worldwide 
public health problem (OMS, 2015). Problem of food 
Safety in the industrialized world differ considerably 
from those of developing countries where traditional 
methods  of  processing  and  packaging,  improper 
holding temperature, poor personal hygiene of food 
handlers  are  still  observed  during  food  marketing 
(Oladipo et al., 2010 ). The risk of the transmission of 
zoonotic  infections  is  also  associated  with  the 

consumption  of  contaminated  meat.  Salmonella 
enterica infections are the second leading cause of 
bacterial foodborne illness and approximately 95% of 
cases of human salmonellosis are associated with 
the consumption of contaminated products such as 
meat,  poultry,  eggs,  milk,  seafood,  and  fresh 
produce (OMS, 2013). These infections may cause 
significant morbidity and mortality  both in  humans 
and  production  animals  as  well  as  considerable

economic losses (Fadlalla et al., 2012; Hendriksen et 
al., 2012). In Burkina Faso, salmonella is considered 
as public health concern and is a common source of 
medical  complications  (Bonkoungou  et  al.,  2013; 
Timbiné  et  al.,  2013;  Dembélé  et  al.,  2014).  The 
utilization  of  antimicrobial  drugs  has  played  an 
important role in animal husbandry, since they are 
used in prophylaxis, treatment and growth promotion 
(EFSA, 2012). However, their abusive use in human 
and  animals  has  led  to  an  increase  bacterial 
resistance among several bacterial strains including 
Salmonella (Li et al., 2013). The husbandry practices 
used in the meat industry and the widespread use of 
medicated  feeds  in  edible  intestines  operations 
made  meat  a  major  reservoir  of  antimicrobial-
resistant  Salmonella  (Sodagari  et  al.,  2015). 
Previous studies showed that  Salmonella  enterica 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Study design and sampling: The study was conducted 
between October 2011 to October 2012, in twenty five 
(25)  open  markets  located  in  Ouagadougou,  Burkina 
Faso (Figure 1). Sampling was done by buying 125g to 
500g of beef (175), beef intestine (50), mutton (175) and 
sheep intestine (50). Samples collected were placed in 
separate  sterile  containers  and  then  in  ice  boxes, 
transported  at  4  °C  to  the  laboratory  and  processed 
within  two  hours.  The  sampling  sites  were  identified 
according to the importance and availability of meat. 
Identification of Salmonella isolates: Salmonella isolation 
was conducted according to ISO 6579: 2002 (E) methods 
lightly modified. Briefly, twenty-five grams (25 g) of each 
sample was mixed in 225 ml of buffered peptone water 
(Liofilchem,  Italy)  with  a  stomacher  lab  blender  400 
(Sewar, England). The suspension of meat was incubated 
at 37°C for 24 hours. An aliquot (1 ml) of pre-enriched 
broth was inoculated into 9 ml of Rappaport-Vassiliadis 
(RV) broth (Liofilchem, Italy) and incubated at 42°C for 24 
hours.  A  loopful  of  enriched  broth  was  streaked  onto 
Xylose-lysine desoxycholate (XLD) and Hektoen enteric 
(HEK) (Liofilchem, Italy) agar plate media and incubated 
at 37°C for 24 hours. All suspected Salmonella colonies 
were  firstly  tested  for  urea,  indole,  lactose,  glucose, 
citrate  metabolism,  gas  production,  mannitol,  mobility, 
oxidase  (Bio-Rad,  France).  Presumed 
isolated  of 
Salmonella  were  suspended  in  physiological  saline 
solution (NaCl, 9g/L in water) for identification by API 20 
E system (BioMerieux, France). The database accessed 
 

isolated from meat and several foods is resistant to 
commonly used antibiotics like amoxicillin/clavulanic 
acid,  aztreonam,  cefalotin,  ceftriaxone,  cefepim, 
gentamicin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, nalidixic 
acid  and  ciprofloxaxin.  (Kagambèga  et  al.,  2011; 
Bagré  et  al.,  2014;  Bsadjo  Tchamba  et  al.,  2015; 
Sodagari et al., 2015). Animals are the main source 
of  the  resistance  of  Salmonella  to  the  different 
antibiotics 
infections 
(kagambèga et al., 2013). Antibiotic resistance has 
been attributed to genetic and environmental factors 
(Sambe-Ba  et  al.,  2013).  In  view  of  the  great 
consumption for beef and mutton in Burkina Faso, 
this  study  was  conducted  to  assess  the  microbial 
quality  of  raw  meat  sold  in  the  local  market  of 
Ouagadougou  and  to  determine  the  antibiotic 
resistance profile of Salmonella enterica.

from the  apiweb™  software (BioMérieux,  France)  was 
used in order to interpret the results. 
Antibiotic susceptibility tests: Antibiogram was done onto 
Mueller-Hinton  agar  (Liofilchem,  Italy)  plate  media 
following  the  standardized  disk  diffusion  method  as 
described by Bauer et al. (1966). Pure colonies of each 
isolate  were  suspended  in  sterile  physiological  saline 
solution (NaCl, 9 g/l %) to prepare a suspension at the 
same turbidity to the 0.5 Mc Farland standards (~ 108 
UFC  /  ml)  and  used  to  sow  the  Mueller-Hinton  agar 
plates. A total of  14 Antimicrobials agents (Liofilchem, 
Italy) were tested: Aminopenicillins (amoxicillin/clavulanic 
acid,  30  µg);  Carboxypenicillins  (ticarcillin,  75  µg); 
Monobactams  (aztreonam,  30  µg);    Carbapenemes 
(imipenem,  10  µg);  Cephalosporins  (cefalotin,  30  µg; 
cefalexin, 30 µg; cefamandol, 30 µg; ceftriaxone, 30 µg; 
cefepim, 30 µg); Aminoglucosides (gentamicin, 30 µg); 
Phenicols 
30  µg);  Cyclines 
(tetracycline, 30 µg); Quinolones (nalidixic acid, 30 µg) 
and  Fluoroquinolones  (ciprofloxaxin,  5  µg).  Inhibition 
diameters of the antibiotics were interpreted according to 
the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility 
Instructions (EUCAST, 2014). 
Statistical analysis: Epi-Info version 3.5.1 software was 
used to calculate the prevalence and MedCalc 11.0.1.0 to 
determine p value of the various parameters. Any p value 
 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

mutton. Low resistance between 30% and 2% in beef and 
between 42% and 5% in mutton were observed for other 
antibiotics  tested.  In  addition,  strains  of  Salmonella 
isolated in intestine products resist only to tetracycline 
(78%) and cefalotin (56%) for beef intestine and (73%) to 
tetracycline for sheep intestine (Table 2).

DISCUSSION 
The present study evaluated the microbial quality of raw 
meat  sold  in  different  markets  of  Ouagadougou.  This 
finding detected the prevalence of (19%) for Salmonella 
spp. in beef, mutton and intestines raw meats slaughtered 
for human consumption in Burkina Faso. Previous study 
in Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Brazil and Iran were found that 
raw meat of beef and chicken sold in open market were 
contaminated respectively by 9%,  29%, 29% and 19% of 
Salmonella (Iroha et al., 2011; Kagambèga et al., 2011; 
Carvalho  et  al.,  2013;  Sodagari  et  al.,  2015).  Rate  of 
Salmonella reported in beef (27%) are higher than mutton 
(11%) (p = 0.0150). As far as intestines are concerned, 
the proportions of Salmonella are lower in beef intestine 
(18%)  than  sheep  intestine  (22%)  (p  =  0.635).  The 
incidence of Salmonella in meats products obtained by 
other  authors  varied  between  0  and  100%  in  Russia, 
Burkina  Faso,  China  and  Iran  (Alali  et  al.,  2012; 
Kagambèga et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2014; 
Sodagari et al., 2015). The presence of these organisms 
in food animals and in raw meat products has relevant 
public  health  implications  (Tassew  et  al.,  2010).  In 
Burkina Faso, in 2011, study conducted by Kagambèga 
et al., (2011); showed a high level of Salmonella 29%; 
where as in this study, Salmonella was found at 19%. As 
observed  in  this  study,  the  reasons  for  the  higher 
incidence of Salmonella contamination can be due to the 
widespread  habit  of  raw  meat  treatment,  the  common 
factors  such  as  overcrowding,  poverty,  inadequate 
sanitary  conditions,  and  poor  general  hygiene 

(Kagambèga et al., 2011; Abd el-Aziz, 2013). Also, it was 
observed that Salmonella was most prevalent in beef. All 
previous  studies  showed  that  Salmonella  was  widely 
distributed  in  retail  meat  globally,  which  increased 
salmonellosis  following  consumption  of  contaminated 
meat or cross-contamination. In Burkina Faso, sheep and 
others animals were mostly roam freely at pasture in the 
bush (Kagambèga et al., 2013). The risk of contamination 
may  be  higher  if  beef  meat  or  mutton  is  consumed 
undercooked (Sodagari et al., 2015). The prevalence may 
be  based  by  diversity  in  sampling  methods,  sampling 
seasons and techniques (Li et al., 2013). However, some 
variations may be due to several factors, sanitation within 
the  slaughterhouse,  and  the  cross-contamination  of 
carcasses  by  contact  with  intestinal  tracts  during 
slaughter or processing and differences among isolation 
methods  applied  to  detect  Salmonella  (Rahimi,  2012; 
Kagambèga et al., 2013). The high level of contamination 
of meat and intestine with Salmonella observed in this 
study  indicates  the  need  for  an  improvement  in  the 
microbiological quality of meat. There is also a need for a 
comprehensive  epidemiological  study  and  control  of 
Salmonella  contamination  at  various  levels  of  meat 
production 
in  Burkina  Faso.  Resistance  rates  of 
Salmonella  are  varied  from  animals’  sample.  The 
Salmonella resistance rates to ticarcillin, tetracycline and 
cefalotin found in this study was higher than resistance 
rates to others antimicrobials because of the overuse of 
these antimicrobials for treatment and growth promotion

in different fields. The resistance to tetracycline obtained 
is  higher  than  those  reported  in  Ethiopia,  Sudan  and 
China in raw meats (Tassew et al., 2010; Fadlalla et al., 
2012; Li et al., 2013). In this study, results on intestines 
strains  are  similar  with the  study  done  in  Ivory  Coast, 
Nigeria and Iran (Coulibaly et al., 2010; Iroha et al., 2011; 
Sodagari et al., 2015). This suggests a potential health 
risk  due  to  consumption  of  meat.  Such  risks  can  be 
minimized  by  avoiding  poor  handling  and  raising  the 
awareness  of  food  handlers.  The  results  of  this  study 
have disclosed two public health problems; the presence 
of  resistant  Salmonella  strains  in  the  possibility  of 
Salmonella human infections through the consumption of 
contaminated food, and the isolation of antibiotic-resistant 
strains might suggest the use of drugs in that animal’s 
environment. The occurrence of antibiotic resistant strains 
of a number of pathogenic bacteria especially Salmonella 
in foods has caused great concern in relation to public 
health (Carlvalho et al., 2013). While the antibiotics use 
has been proven an effective means for the prevention 
and control of Salmonella infection, their abusive use can 
have adverse consequences by promoting the selection 
and prevalence of drug resistant microbial populations (Li 
 
CONCLUSION 
This  study  show  the  degree  of  contamination  by 
salmonella enterica in raw meat sold in the open market 
of  Ouagadougou,  Burkina  Faso.  Of 
the  samples 
analyzed, almost all of the meat was contaminated by this 
enteropathogen. In addition, several Salmonella strains

Continuous  and  improper  use  of  this  antibiotic  may 
increase resistance of antibiotics, thereby compromising 
human  food  safety  and  creating  a  difficulty  in  treating 
human  salmonellosis  (Sodagari  et  al.,  2015).  The 
problem may be due to the natural resistance of species 
to  certain  antibiotics,  possible  transfer  of  antibiotic 
resistance among species and the use of sub-therapeutic 
doses of antibiotics in animal feeds to improve animal 
productivity, which could also select for resistant strains 
(EFSA, 2012; Sambe-Ba et al., 2013). This practice leads 
into a possibility that bacterial resistance developing in 
the  animals  or  food  animals’  transfers  to  the  human 
population  thus  posing  a  risk  for  public  health  by 
spreading of the resistance (Kagambèga et al., 2013). In 
Burkina Faso, the irrational use of antibiotics in animal 
husbandry  is  considered  a  major  cause  of  increased 
Salmonella resistance. Furthermore, unlimited access to 
these agents without a prescription or under veterinary 
control may be additional reasons for the high level of 
resistance.  Therefore,  surveillance  of  antimicrobial 
resistance should be done on food-borne pathogens. 

isolated were resistant to commonly antibiotics used. This 
study  confirms  that  beef,  sheep  and  intestines  are  a 
major reservoir of resistant Salmonella enterica in Burkina 
Faso. Special attention should be taken to prevent the 
scattering of resistant strains in the environment.
