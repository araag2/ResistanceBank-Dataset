Summary

Mastitis is one of the largest production concerns in the dairy industry world-
wide. Mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus is a major concern to the dairy
industry because of its resistance to antibiotic treatment. In this report, the
results of antibiotic susceptibility test, carried out on 236 Staphylococcus aureus
isolated from milk samples which were collected from cases of mastitis in cow
herds of China, are presented. The regions and number of isolates include
Inner Mongolia (112), Hebei (58) and Heilongjiang (66). Susceptibility to
ampicillin, penicillin G, amoxicillin, piperacillin, cephalexin, cephazolin, cefo-
taxime, ceftazidime, cefoxitin, SMZ-TMP, gentamycin, kanamycin, norﬂoxacin,
ciproﬂoxacin, oﬂoxacin, furaxone, torlamician, roxithromycin, clindamycin and
vancomycin was determined by the disc diffusion method. Antibiotic suscepti-
bility testing showed 87.30% (206 of 236) isolates were resistant to penicillin
G. This result compares with the reports from other countries; the overall level
of resistance was generally high for all antimicrobial agents tested.

Introduction

Bovine mastitis is an inﬂammation of the udder caused
by microbial infection and imposes a serious economic
burden in the dairy industry (Miles et al., 1992). Among
the mastitis pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is
considered an agent of major concern because of the low
response to treatment and its propensity to recur chroni-
cally. Targeted antimicrobial therapy plays an important
role in mastitis control by reducing the levels of herd
infection and by preventing new infections. S. aureus
isolates resistant
to antibiotics have been reported in
studies in many countries. (Owens et al., 1997; Aarestrup
et al., 1998; Lange et al., 1999; De Oliveira et al., 2000).
Hence, antimicrobial resistance monitoring of S. aureus
isolates from herds will be important for the establishment
of a more effective targeting of therapy for staphylococcal
udder infections.

The province surveyed in this study contains over
45% of the dairy cows currently in China and produces
56% of
the milk (source: National Bureau statistics,

China statistical yearbook). Eight hundred thirty-ﬁve
(835) quarter milk samples were collected from 288
dairy cows at 18 farms during 2005–2006. A cow with
a SCC ‡ 500 000 cells/ml was considered to have masti-
tis. Cultures resulted in the isolation of 285 S. aureus
strains. The regions and number of
isolates included
inner Mongolia (112), Hebei province (58) and Hei-
longjiang (66). Susceptibility to ampicillin, penicillin G,
amoxicillin, piperacillin, cephalexin, cephazolin, cefotax-

have mastitis. A total of 236 strains of S. aureus were used
in the study.

Before sampling, the teat ends were cleaned with warm
water and alcohol swabs and allowed to dry. The ﬁrst few
streams were discarded, and then 5 ml of secretion was
collected in 10-ml sterile tubes. Samples were cooled and
immediately transported to the Veterinary microbiological
laboratory (Imau, Huhhot, China). From each milk sam-
ple, 0.1 ml was plated on blood agar plate, Chapman’s
agar plate and Baird-Parker agar and incubated at 37°C
for 48 h. Suspect isolates were identiﬁed by conventional
methods,
including Gram staining, colony morphology,
coagulase, haemolysis, DNAse, tests for catalase, acetoin
and anaerobic fermentation of mannitol. The conﬁrmed
isolates of S. aureus were preserved at )70°C in LB med-
ium containing 15% of glycerol.

Antibiotic susceptibility testing

Antibiotic susceptibility test was performed using disc
diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton Agar (Oxoid) accord-
ing to the National Committee of Clinical Laboratory
Standards (NCCLS). Five colonies from the blood agar
medium, incubated at 37°C for 18 h, were suspended in
2 ml of sterile saline. The bacterial suspension was adjusted
to a density approximately equal to 1.5 · 108 CFU/ml
according to the McFarland standard. A dry sterile cotton
wool swab was placed in the bacterial suspension, and

excess liquid was expressed against the inside of the tube.
The bacterial suspension was inoculated onto Mueller-Hin-
ton agar with the swab to ensure that the whole surface of
the agar was covered. Susceptibility test discs were obtained
commercially (Beijing Tiantan Microorganism Reagent
Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). The antibiotic discs, containing
the following antibiotics: ampicillin (10 lg), penicillin G
(10 lg),amoxicillin (20 lg), piperacillin (100 lg), cepha-
lexin (30 lg), Cephazolin (30 lg), cefotaxime (30 lg),
ceftazidime (30 lg), cefoxitin (30 lg), SMZ-TMP (23.75/
1.25 lg), gentamicin (10 lg), kanamycin (30 lg), norﬂox-
acin (10 lg), ciproﬂoxacin (5 lg), Oﬂoxacin (5 lg), furax-
erythromycin (15 lg), ROX (15 lg),
one;
clindamycin (2 lg) and vancomycin (30 lg), were dis-
pensed on the surface of the medium with a sterile forceps
and incubated aerobically at 37°C for 18 h. The results were
recorded as resistant or susceptible based on the measure-
ment of
the inhibition zone diameter using a sliding
calliper according to the interpretive standards of NCCLS.
The reference strain used for antibiotic susceptibility assays
was S. aureus ATCC 25923.

(87.30%) to penicillin G, of the total province surveyed,
Inner Mongolia (91.1%), Hebei (85.4%) and Heilongjiang
(81.8%). Only four of the isolated strains were susceptible
to all antibiotics tested, while the remaining 232 isolates
were resistant at least to one of the antibiotics. Antibiotic
resistance determination revealed that 135 isolates (57.2%)
were resistant to seven or more antibiotics. Also, resistance
to SMZ-TMP (57.20%), furaxone (58.47%), roxithromycin
(58.90%), vancomycin (53.81%) and ampicillin (47.88%)
was observed among S. aureus strains. In conclusion, the
resistance demonstrated by the isolates tested was generally
high for all antimicrobial agents tested (Fig. 1).

Discussion

S. aureus has been the main subject of studies on antibiotic
resistance because of its importance for mastitis in dairy
cows. The occurrence of bovine mastitis has
serious
consequences for animal and public health. Antimicrobial
susceptibility of S. aureus isolated from bovine mastitis
varies widely by region (Makovec and Ruegg, 2003; Gill
et al., 2006). In this study, of the 236 isolates evaluated for
antimicrobial resistance, isolates resistant to multiple anti-
biotics were most common. The widespread of resistance
to penicillin G could be a consequence of the frequently
used in intramammary infections in China. In cases of
mastitis choosing the wrong antibiotic or applying an
incomplete treatment of animals also contributes signiﬁ-
cantly to the development of bacterial resistance. Countries
with a policy of prudent use of antibiotics in veterinary
practices have shown lower levels of resistance compared
with other countries (Rabello et al., 2005; Aarestrup et al.,
1998; Grave et al., 1999; De Oliveira et al., 2000).

A large number of the isolates were found to be resis-
tant to long established antibiotics (penicillin G, ampicil-
lin, roxithromycin etc.). Among the 20 antibiotics tested
against the isolated S. aureus strains, penicillin G was the
least effective. This result is similar to or higher than the
results reported from other countries’ studies (Gentilini
et al., 2000; Malinowski et al., 2002).

Resistance to more than one kind of antibiotics was
observed in approximately 98% of the S. aureus isolates
(232 out of 236) in this study. The high multiple resistance
levels must be of concern because antibiotic resistance is
carried on plasmids that can pass from one staphylococcal
species to another (Werckenthin et al., 2001).

Overall, the antimicrobial susceptibility results of the
236 strains of S. aureus tested in our study demonstrated
high resistance patterns. This might be attributed to mis-
use of antibacterial agents in China, where these are often
dispensed without a prescription. A high rate of resistance
to these antibiotics was perhaps inevitable. To date, S.
aureus mastitis has been particularly difﬁcult to treat, and
antibiotic-resistant strains have become common. Grow-
ing concerns
resistance have
spurred studies on treatment methods. Although resis-
tance level may provide important information towards
the development of effective prevention and treatment
strategies for this disease, eradication of S. aureus mastitis
has not been possible. A vaccine to protect against this
infection would be beneﬁcial in the future.
