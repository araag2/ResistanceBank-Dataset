Abstract:  Escherichia  coli  remains  a  public  health  concern worldwide as an organism that 
causes diarrhea and its reservoir in raw milk may play an important role in the survival and 
transport of pathogenic strains. Diarrheagenic E. coli strains are diverse food-borne pathogens 
and  causes  diarrhea  with  varying  virulence  in  humans.  We  investigated  the  prevalence  of 
pathogenic  E.  coli  in  raw  milk  from  two  commercial  dairy  farms.  Four  hundred  raw  milk 
samples,  200  from  each  dairy  farm,  were  screened  for  the  presence  of  fliCH7,  eagR,  ial,  
eagg,  lt,  and  papC  genes.  In  dairy  farm  A,  100  E.  coli  were  identified  based  on  culture,  
oxidase and Gram staining, while 88 isolates from dairy farm B were identified in the same 
manner. Gene detection showed fliCH7 27 (54%) to be the highest gene detected from farm A 
and  lt  2  (4%)  to  be  the  lowest.  The  highest  gene  detected  in  dairy  farm  B  was  fliCH7  16 
(43.2%) and papC 1 (2.7%) was the least. The amplification of pathogenic genes associated 
with diarrheagenic E. coli from cows’ raw milk demonstrates that potentially virulent E. coli 
strains are widely distributed in raw milk and may be a cause of concern for human health.

1. Introduction 

Escherichia coli is a commensal in the intestines of a variety of animals, including man. However, 
diarrhoeal diseases caused by the pathogenic strains of this species can be debilitating and sometimes 
fatal [1]. The mechanisms involved in the disease processes and virulence attributes have been used to 
differentiate pathogenic strains of E. coli and is divided into diarrhoeal pathogens causing diarrhoea 
(diarrhoeagenic  E.  coli)  and  extraintestinal  E.  coli  (ExPEC)  [2]  based  on  the  site  of  infection. 
However, E. coli pathotypes may cause three main types of infections: sepsis/meningitis, enteric and 
diarrheal diseases, and urinary tract infections [3].  

Enteric pathogens have been broadly divided into enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic 
E.  coli  (EPEC),  enteroinvasive  E.  coli  (EIEC),  enterohaemorrhagic  E.  coli  (EHEC)  have  been 
established, while enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), diffusely adherent E. coli, necrotoxic E. coli, and 
cell-detaching  E.  coli  [4].  Two  additional  E.  coli  pathotypes,  collectively  called  extraintestinal 
pathogenic E. coli [5] are responsible for extraintestinal infections. Extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli 
consist  of  uropathogenic E.  coli  (UPEC)  causing  urinary  tract  infections, E.  coli  strains  that  causes 
septicaemia, and neonatal meningitis associated E. coli (MNEC) [6]. In all E. coli isolates the uidA 
gene, which codes for the β-glucuronidase enzyme, serve as a target for fluorogenic PCR detection of 
E. coli in approximately 95% of naturally occurring E. coli. 

Epidemiology, treatment, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations can be used to preliminary identify 
each pathotype [7]. However, more researchers are using molecular methods such as polymerase chain 
reaction  to  identify  pathotypes.  EPEC  pathotype  has  been  sub-divided  into  typical  and  atypical  EPEC 
depending  on  their  adhesion  mechanisms  in  human  epithelial  cells  [8].  Typical  EPEC’s  adhesion  is 
mediated by bfpA found in the EPEC adhesion factors type plasmid (EAF) that makes the organism to 
adhere to human epithelia cells in a localized manner [8]. The presence of locus of enterocyte effacement 
has been used to identify atypical EPEC. This locus codes for the gene of attaching and effacing, eae.  
This gene enables the bacteria to adhere and destroy human intestinal enterocytes [9].  

Enteroaggregative  E.  coli,  producing  enteroaggregative  mechanisms  that  promotes  diarrhea  in 
humans are coded for by the eagR, the master regulator of EAEC virulence, controls the expression  
of adherence factors, a dispersin protein, and a cluster of genes encoded on the EAEC chromosome.  
One  of  the  most  common  clinical  manifestations  of  EAEC  infection  is  watery  diarrhea,  
usually unaccompanied by blood or mucus. 

EIEC  is  characterized  by  the  destruction  of  the  colonic  epithelium  caused  by  the  inflammatory 
response induced upon invasion of the mucosa by EIEC [10] using the ial (marker for invasivity) gene. 
ETEC are important causes of total diarrheal episodes worldwide. These strains cause diarrhea through 
the action of enterotoxins: the heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable (ST) enterotoxins. Some strains may 
express  an  LT  only,  an  ST  only,  or  both  an  LT  and  an  ST  coded  for  by  lt  and  st  in  the  plasmid. 
Adenylate cyclase is activated by LT, causing diarrhea while guanylyl cyclase in intestinal epithelial 

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2014, 11 
 
cells is activated by ST causing fluid secretion. E. coli strains that are capable of producing both LT 
and ST toxins (ETEC) can cause severe diarrhea [11].  

11952 

Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) is associated with foodborne outbreaks in the developed world 
and can cause bloody diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis (HC) and the Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome 
(HUS) due to the elaboration of Shiga toxin (Stx). In EHEC strains, stx-genes are typically found in 
transmissible lambdoid bacteriophages [12]. Other virulence factors such as membrane protein intimin, 
encoded by the eae gene, fliCH7 encoding flagella antigen H7 and enterohaemolysin, encoded by the 
HlyA gene [13] have been identified.  

Virulence  factors  such  as  toxins  (cytotoxic  necrotizing  factors  and  hemolysin),  adhesins  (P 
fimbriae, afrimbriae, type 1 fimbriae, S and F1C fimbriae), polysaccharide coatings (group II capsules) 
and siderophores (the aerobactin system) [14,15], associated UPEC are thought to be responsible for 
the  pathogenic  potential  of  the  organism.  Specific  adhesins  that  mediates  specific  adhesion  can  be 
differentiated  based  on  the  receptor  binding  specificity.  The  most  significant  mannose-resistant 
adhesins are the P fimbriae encoded by E. coli pap (pyelonephritis associated pilus) operon. However, 
they are expressed by few E. coli serotypes [16]. Uropathogenic E. coli strains have been identified by 
detecting urovirulence factors including those mentioned earlier using conventional PCR [15]. 

Discriminating various E. coli pathotypes from cattle and their products have been greatly studied 
in  the  last  two  decades  with  biomolecular  techniques  favoured  over  serology  in  detection  of  
E.  coli  pathotypes  because  they  are  more  sensitive  and  specific  [17‒21].  It  therefore  became  the 
objective of this study to find the prevalence of E. coli virulence genes from two dairy farms in the 
Eastern Cape, South Africa.  

2. Experimental Section 

2.1. Study Sites 

Eastern  Cape  Province  is  one  of  the  poorest  and  second  largest  provinces  in  South  Africa  and 
mainly  comprised  of  rural  settlements,  it  is  also  the  “livestock”  province  of  the  country  carrying  
46%  of  South  Africa’s  goats,  28%  sheep,  and  21%  cattle.  Dairy  farm  A  has  been  in  operation  
since 2007, it has 800 dairy cows and produces about 10,000 L of milk per day which is bought by one 
of the biggest milk companies in South Africa. Dairy farm A has a rotary milking parlour whereas 
dairy farm B has an in-line milking system. Both dairy farms are located in the Eastern Cape Province. 
Dairy farm B has been in operation since 2008, it has 600 dairy cows and produces about 8000 L of 
milk per day.  

2.2. Isolation and Identification 

We collected 400 raw milk samples from individual lactating cows showing clinical and subclinical 
signs of mastitis from the chosen two dairy farms (200 (100 from clinical and 100 from subclinical 
mastitis) from farm A and 200 (100 from clinical and 100 from subclinical mastitis) from farm B).  
Clinical mastitis occurs when visible signs of inflammation are observed in the udder of the cow or  
the teats; while Subclinical mastitis is more subtle in that no signs of infection are visible this requires 
regular  monitoring  and  laboratory  testing.  Subclinical  mastitis  was  determined  using  California 

11953 

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2014, 11 
 
Mastitis Test. Samples were collected according to the in-house procedure on each farm. Briefly, each 
milking station has a small collection bottle with a little hole for sample collection that is open and 
closed using a tap. The bottles are washed after each individual cow’s milking session. The samples 
were collected from that tap. The samples were cultured on selective medium Violet red bile—mug 
agar (Merck, Johannesburg, South Africa) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The plates were checked 
under UV light at 360–370 nm after 24 h of incubation. Light blue fluorescence indicates the presence 
of  E.  coli  [22,23].  Biochemical  tests  including  Gram  staining,  catalase  and  oxidase  test  were 
performed.  Those  organisms  that  were  Gram  negative,  catalase  positive  and  oxidase  negative  were 
identified using API 20E (BioMerieux, Marcy I’Etiole, France) following manufacturer’s instructions.  

2.3. DNA Extraction 

DNA was extracted from identified E. coli and from a positive control strains for E. coli (ATCC 
8739, South African Bureau of Standards (SABS), No. ESC 20) purchased from South African Bureau 
of Standards, Pretoria, South Africa. DNA extraction was done following the method of Maugeri et al. 
[24] and Lopez Saucedo et al. [25]. Briefly, single colonies of presumptive E. coli grown overnight at 
37 °C on EMBA plates were picked, suspended in 200 μL of sterile distilled water, vortexed for 2 min 
using MS2 Minishaker (Digisystem Laboratory Instruments Inc., New Taipei City, Taiwan). The cells 
were then centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm (ThermoFisher Scientific, Schwerte, Germany). Five 
hundred microliters (500 µL) distilled water was pipetted into the eppendorf tubes, vortexed and the 
cells were lysed using a heat on Dri-Block DB.2A (Techne, Johannesburg, South Africa) for 15 min at 
100 °C. The cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min using a MiniSpin 
microcentrifuge (ThermoFisher Scientific). The supernatant was used as a template in the PCR assay 
immediately after extraction. 

2.4. Detection of Virulence Genes in E. coli Isolates 

Oligonucleotide  primers  targeting  the  uidA  gene  were  used  to  confirm  the  isolates  in  the 
polymerase chain reaction with the conditions as shown in Table 1. PCR assay was carried out in a 25 
μL  reaction  volume  containing  a  24  µL  of  2×master  mix  (containing  0.05  U/µL  of  Taq  DNA 
polymerase, reaction buffer, 4 mM MgCl2, and 0.4 mM of each dNTP) and 1µL of template DNA. 
Oligonucleotide  primers  targeting  the  fliCH7  gene  encoding  for  structural  flagella  antigen  H7  in 
Enterohemorrhagic E.  coli, eagR  gene encoding for antiaggregative protein of Enteroaggregative E. 
coli, ial gene encoding for invasion-associated locus of Enteroinvasive E. coli, eae gene encoding for 
Enteropathogenic E. coli intimin, lt gene encoding for heat-labile toxins found in Enterotoxigenic E. 
coli and papC gene characterizing uropathogenic E. coli were used in the polymerase chain reaction 
following the conditions in Table 1. The positive control for uidA was E. coli ATCC 8739 (SABS No. 
ESC  20)  purchased 
in  Pretoria;  
positive  control  for  the  eagR  gene  is  DSM  10974,  DSM  10973  for  lt  gene,  DSM  4618  for  papC,  
DSM 8695 for eae gene and DSM 9025 for ial gene and where all purchased from Leibniz-Institut  
DSMZ—Deutsche  Sammlung  von  Mikroorganismen  und  Zellkulturen,  Braunschweig,  Germany. 
However the positive control for fliCh7 gene (EHEC) was not available at the time of purchase.

2.5. Gel Electrophoresis 

11955 

The PCR products (10 μL aliquots) were resolved in 1.8% agarose gel containing 5 μL ethidium 
bromide in 1× TAE buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM Na-acetate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8) [27,31] before 
being visualized and photographed under the Alliance 4.7 XD-79 System (Uvitec, Cambridge, UK).  
A 100-bp DNA ladder was included on each gel as a molecular size standard. The electrophoresis was 
carried out at 100 V for 1 h.

3.1.2. Molecular Characterization of E. coli 

Isolates  that  were  Gram  negative,  oxidase  negative,  and  catalase  positive  were  screened  for  
E. coli uidA gene using PCR assays. Dairy farm B showed 50 (57.5%) uidA gene amplification while 
dairy  farm  A  showed  37  (42.5%)  amplification  (Table  2;  Figure  1).  Amplification  of  several  genes 
representing E. coli pathotypes is shown in Figure 1. The E. coli isolates that were positive by PCR  
for fliCH7, eae, lt, papC, ial, and eagR genes are summarized in Table 3. Dairy farm A had the highest 
amount of virulence genes compared to dairy farm B except for lt gene, usually found in ETEC which 
was higher (13.5%) in farm B. The target gene of E. coli O157:H7 (fliCH7) was noticed in the isolates 
obtained from both dairy farms in high amounts in comparison to other virulence genes. Farm A is situated 
next  to  a  wastewater  treatment  plant  and  the  discharged  final  effluent  is  used  to  clean  the  clusters, 
milking  machines,  milking  utensils  and  the  floor  of  the  milking  parlour  this  could  explain  the  
high  occurrence  of  pathogenic  E.  coli  in  this  farm.  Also  the  milking  parlour  is  cleaned  once  a  day  
in this farm, whereas in farm B it is cleaned twice a day after every milking activity. Cattle faeces were 

 

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2014, 11 
 
observed around the farm floor, milking and feeding equipments. Poor hygiene of feeding equipment 
and contaminated feed plays an important role in milk contamination.

Mastitis in lactating dairy cows is commonly caused by E. coli strains. The severity and course of 
mastitis differs enormously depending on the individual cow’s response. However, the strain virulence 
may  also  play  a  role.  The  ability  of  E.  coli  to  pick  up  DNA  from  the  environment  and  therefore 
virulence  genes  are  well  demonstrated  [32].  E.  coli  has  been  regarded  as  an  indicator  of  fecal 
contamination  [33],  however,  in  the  milk  industry;  it  is  regarded  as  poor  hygiene  indicator  and 
insufficient sanitary practices during milking [34]. Raw unpasteurized milk can be an important source 
of food-borne pathogens because it harbors a variety of microorganisms while bulk tank raw milk may 
be contaminated by udder excretion of infected animals [35]. Unpasteurized milk is used to produce 
 

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2014, 11 
 
several types of cheese [35,36]. Consumption of unpasteurized and pasteurized milk has been blamed 
for disease in humans [37].

3.1.3. Virulence Genes from E. coli Isolates in Raw Cow’s Milk 

Different virulence genes were isolated from E. coli in diarrheic stools and water [38]. We based 
our  selection  of  virulence  genes  for  this  study  on  their  association  with  E.  coli  strains  causing  
extra-intestinal and intestinal infections. There are no biochemical difference between bovine mastitis 
E.  coli  strains  and  faecal  strains.  Approximately  30.3%  of  the  isolates  in  our  study  did  not  show 
amplification  of  examined  genes.  This  might  be  indication  that  E.  coli  strains  associated  with 
mammary  gland  infections  may  use  different  mechanisms  to  cause  diseases  [39].  In  another  study,  
E.  coli  isolates  (10.7%)  from  bovine  mastitis  were  found  to  have  a  single  virulence  gene  [40].  
Several  virulence  factors  have  been  identified  in  bovine  mastitis  associated  E.  coli  isolates  [41]  
but many bovine mastitis isolates lack any of the virulence factors [42].  

In our study all of the isolates were stx1 and stx 2 negative. This result is similar to the results of [43,44] 
where stx1 and 2 were not detected from bovine mastitis. This might not be a true reflection of the 
results since sub-types of stx 1 and stx 2 were not tested. The fliCH7 gene is one of the genes used as a 
marker  to  identify  E.  coli  O157:H7  [45]  has  been  amplified  from  27  (54%)  samples  from  farm  A  
and  16  (43.2%)  from  dairy  farm  B.  This  gene  has  also  been  isolated  in  E.  coli  from  water  by  
Okoh  and  Osode  [46].  Although  fliCH7  gene’s  associated  with  mastitis  has  not  been  isolated  from 
cows with mastitis in South Africa, its association with severe clinical symptoms, including hemolytic 
colitis,  hemolytic-uremic  syndrome  (HUS)  and  diarrhea  have  been  well  established  [47,48].  
Yogurt made on a farm from pasteurized milk was implicated in people affected by E. coli O157:H7, 
causing HUS cases among children [49]. Therefore, its presence in raw milk is a cause for concern. 

The lt gene which encodes for heat-labile toxin, found in Enterotoxigenic E. coli [50] was amplified 
from 2 (4 %) isolates in dairy farm B and 5 (13.5%) dairy farm A. These results are different from 
what Frank et al. [51] reported (3.2%) of ETEC strains in milk and milk products. As far as we know 
heat-labile  toxin  has  never  been  shown  to  be  associated  with  mastitis.  However,  the  organism  that 
produces heat-labile toxin, Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), causes infantile and travelers’ in humans 
from developed to underdeveloped countries [52]. Contaminated food including milk and water serves 
as a route of infection for ETEC [53]. The disease manifests as a severe cholera-like syndrome [53,54]. 
This gene has also been detected E. coli from water [38]. 

The ial gene (a marker for the virulence plasmid pInv) which is found in Enteroinvasive E. coli was 
also  amplified  from  4  (8%)  isolates  in  dairy  farm  A  and  2  (5.4%)  isolates  from  dairy  farm  B. 
Contaminated food and water have been implicated in the transmission of EIEC [55,56] even though 
person-to-person cases of EIEC have been noted [57]. When this organism is ingested, invasion and 
adhesion of the epithelial cells in the intestine mediated by the ial gene occurs. The characteristics of 
the illness are the appearance of blood and mucus in a condition called colitis of infected individuals [58]. 
Diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever, a generalized malaise, vomiting, chills, are some of the symptoms. 
Outbreaks have been associated with hamburger meat and unpasteurized milk [59]. This is the first report 
where  EIEC  has  been  isolated  from  raw  milk  in  the  Eastern  Cape  Province  of  South  Africa. 
Enteroaggregative E. coli was isolated and eagR amplified from 5 (10%) isolates in dairy farm A and

4 (10.8%) isolates from dairy farm B. Human clinical, animal, and environmental samples are some  
of  the  samples  where  this  organism  has  been  increasingly  isolated  and  characterized  around  the  
world  [60,61].  However,  frequencies  of  Enteroaggregative  Escherichia  coli  among  cattle  in  the  
Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, are not known.

The virulence factor, eae, is associated with EPEC strains, defined as Stx-negative E. coli strains 
able to cause “attaching and effacing” (A/E) lesions, and also characterized by bacterial adherence to 
the  intestinal  epithelium  intimately  [62].  The  eaeA  and  bfp  genes  have  been  used  for  identification  
of EPEC [63]. In our study, the ratio of eae was 9 (24.3%) in dairy farm B and 9 (18%) isolates in 
dairy farm A. However, in our study, we did not find any evidence of bfp in all the isolates tested.  
Our  results  inform  us  that  the  isolated  organisms  were  atypical  EPEC  as  they  lacked  the  gene  bfp.  
The  presence  of  this  pathogen  in  milk  proved  to  be  variable  in  different  regions.  In  Brazil,  
Aleixo and Aver [64] reported EPEC in 25% milk samples while 26 (27.7%) from bulk milk were 
EPEC in Trinidad [65]. These values were higher than the 3.09% reported by Holko et al. [66] from 
Slovakia and that of Altalhi and Hussen [41], Saudi Arabia. EPEC strains are the oldest recognized 
category of diarrheagenic E. coli [67] and are well known prominent cause of diarrhea, particularly  
in children in less developed countries [68]. 

Uropathogenic  E.  coli  (UPEC)  which  contain  papC  characterized  as  one  of  the  pathogenic  gene 
associated with the adhesion of UPEC to the upper urinary tract in humans [2] was amplified in three 
(6%) isolates from dairy farm A and one (2.7%) isolate in dairy farm B. The papC gene was reported 
to  be  associated  with  persistent  mastitis  by  Dogan  et  al.  [69].  Ingestion  of  milk  contaminated  with 
UPEC it can lead to cystitis in the bladder and acute pyelonephritis in the kidneys [3,70]. 

Act, No. 54 of 1972 in South Africa governs the safety of milk, and sets standards to which milk 
and dairy products, foodstuffs, cosmetics and disinfection must conform to. According to this Act milk 
may not contain pathogenic organisms, extraneous matter, any inflammatory product or any substance 
which may render it unfit for consumption. Bacteriologically it may not contain more than 20 coliforms or 
any E. coli per mL. This study indicates that raw milk samples from both dairy farm A and dairy farm B 
were not complying with the act and could be a course for public health concern as some pathogenic 
genes known to be associated with diarheagenic E. coli were detected.  

4. Conclusions  

The  results  obtained  in  this  study  shows  that  raw  cow’s  milk  available  to  consumers  in  the  
Eastern Cape, South Africa was contaminated with the pathogen E. coli. Regular washing of milker’s 
hands  and  animal  udders  together  with  sterilization  of  utensils  and  dairy  equipment,  is  highly 
recommended as strict preventive measures. This might help in suppression of mastitis disease from 
the herd. Teaching and training programs for those working at the dairies can possibly improve the 
situation.
