The objective of this study was to determine the minimal
from food animals and the possible underlying colistin
colistin for Escherichia coli
resistance mechanisms. During 2007–2014, 4,438 E. coli
food animal
origins were collected. The susceptibility of colistin was tested by the agar dilution
method. Mutations in pmrA, pmrB, and mgrB and the presence of mcr-1 gene were
determined by PCR and DNA sequencing. Complementation experiments were carried
out to evaluate the contribution of the mutations to colistin resistance. There was
a high frequency of colistin resistance in E. coli from pigs on farm (24.1%) and at
slaughter (24.3%) in 2013–2014, followed by chickens on farm (14.0%) and at slaughter
(9.5%). The resistance frequency of E. coli in cow isolates was the lowest (0.9%). MIC
distribution for colistin showed that most isolates (75.2%) were distributed at 0.25 mg/L–
0.5 mg/L, followed by 4 mg/L–8 mg/L (16.8%). Compared with the isolates from pigs
and chickens recovered during 2013–2014, E. coli
isolates collected during 2007–
2008 (5.5%) and 2010–2011 (12.4%) showed signiﬁcantly lower frequency of colistin
resistance (P < 0.05). DNA sequencing and complementation experiments failed to
detect any insertion inactivation or mutation in pmrA, pmrB, and mgrB associated with
colistin resistance. However, 91.0% colistin-resistant isolates were positive for mcr-1.
The high frequency of colistin resistance and mcr-1 gene among E. coli
isolates from
food animals in China urged the need to minimize potential risks of colistin resistance
development and the spread of mcr-1 gene.

INTRODUCTION

The rising prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae (GNB),
especially carbapenem- resistant, has resulted in a renewed interest in polymyxins, especially
polymyxin E (colistin), for the management of gram-negative infections in many countries (Falagas
and Michalopoulos, 2006; Cassir et al., 2014). Despite their relatively recent reintroduction in
clinical practice, reports on colistin resistant isolates are on the rise (Falagas et al., 2010; Olaitan
et al., 2014a). Resistance to polymyxins has been traditionally regarded as occurring via mutations

Colistin Resistance in Escherichia coli from Food Animals

in genes regulating the synthesis of LAra4N (Falagas et al.,
2010; Olaitan et al., 2014b). However, we recently described
for the ﬁrst time the emergence of plasmid-mediated colistin
resistance gene, mcr-1, which now has been identiﬁed in several
Enterobacteriaceae species from various sources (environment,
food, animal and humans) (Liu et al., 2016).

Colistin has been used in veterinary medicine through
prophylactic or metaphylactic practices, but the prevalence of
colistin resistance in bacteria isolated from animals in many
countries was still
low (Kempf et al., 2013; Wasyl et al.,
2013; Quesada et al., 2014).
In China, colistin has been
widely used in veterinary medicine, especially in swine and
poultry for many years. We previously detected high prevalence
of mcr-1 among E. coli
isolates from pigs at slaughter in
Guangzhou (Liu et al., 2016). Soon after, mcr-1 gene has been
reported to be present in Enterobacteriaceae from animals, food
and humans worldwide (Schwarz et al., 2001; Quan et al.,
2017; Wang et al., 2017a). However,
little is known about
the prevalence of colistin resistance and mcr-1 gene among
commensal E. coli isolates from other food animals in China.
The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of
colistin resistance among commensal E. coli isolates from farm
animals (chicken, cattle, and pig) and food animals at slaughter
recovered from 12 provinces of China and to determine the
possible underlying mechanisms among part of colistin-resistant
isolates.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Origin of E. coli Isolates
Cloacal samples from chickens (laying hens, chickens, and
broilers) and rectal swabs from pigs (piglets, weaned pigs,
fattening pigs, and sows) and cattle were collected from 107
food animal farms located in diﬀerent geographic areas of
China (Guangdong, Henan, Jiangxi, Ningxia, Jilin, Qinghai,
Sichuan, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Shandong, Beijing, and Neimeng)
from May 2013 to August 2014 (Table 1). Animals were
randomly selected for sampling on each farm based on their
age and stage of production. Ten to thirty samples per stage of
production per farm were collected. In addition, cecal contents
of chickens from seven farmers markets and two live-bird
markets and rectal swabs of pigs from two live pig markets
and eight abattoirs located in Guangdong, Henan, Shandong,
Liaoning, and Sichuan province were collected at slaughter
between April 2013 and August 2014. No more than ﬁve animal
samples per farm were analyzed. All samples were seeded on
MacConkey agar plates and were incubated at 37◦C for 24 h.
One presumptive colony with typical E. coli morphology and
size was selected and then inoculated on eosin-methylene blue
agar. After incubation, suspected E. coli colony was identiﬁed
using classical biochemical methods. In addition, 349 E. coli
isolates (91 were from chicken during 2007–2008, 86 from
chicken during 2010–2011, and 172 from pigs during 2010–2011)
from healthy food animals mentioned in our previous study
were also included in this study for comparison (Yang et al.,
2014).

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing
The minimal
inhibitory concentration (MIC) of colistin
was determined by the agar dilution method according to
the protocols recommended in M100-S25 of
the (Clinical
and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2013). For isolates from
pigs at slaughter, MICs of ampicillin, cefotaxime, imipenem,
gentamicin,
apramycin, ﬂorfenicol,
tetracycline, ciproﬂoxacin, and fosfomycin were also determined.
The results were interpreted according to epidemiological
cut-oﬀ (ECOFF) values recommended by EUCAST1 (colistin,
ﬂorfenicol, and neomycin) and the interpretative criteria
recommended by CLSI (M100-S25) (ampicillin, cefotaxime,
gentamicin, amikacin, fosfomycin, and ciproﬂoxacin) (Clinical
and Laboratory Standards Institute, 2013).

amikacin, neomycin,

Statistical signiﬁcance for the comparison of resistance
prevalence data was determined by the χ2 test. P values less than
0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.

PCR Ampliﬁcation and Sequencing
A total of 200 colistin-resistant E. coli
isolates of diﬀerent
origins (127 from pigs, 70 from chickens, and 3 from cows)
were randomly selected for PCR ampliﬁcation of mcr-1
(Liu et al., 2016). In addition, 50 of them were randomly
selected for sequencing for genes encoding PmrA, PmrB,
and MgrB. pmrA were ampliﬁed using primers described
previously (Quesada et al., 2014). The primers used for
ampliﬁcation of entire mgrB and pmrB genes were as
follows: EmgrB-F (5(cid:48)- CCGCTGAGTAATAATCCTAT -3(cid:48)) and
EmgrB-R (5(cid:48)- TACAACCAAAGACGCAAT -3(cid:48)), EpmrB-F (5(cid:48)-

ATAAGCTGAAACGGATGGC -3(cid:48)) and EpmrB-R (5(cid:48)- CATA
ATAATCAGGGCGAAAGT -3(cid:48)). PCR products of pmrA, pmrB,
and mgrB were sequenced and the nucleotides and deduced
protein sequences were analyzed at the National Center for
Biotechnology Information web site2. In addition, the pmrA,
pmrB, and mgrB sequences of ﬁve colistin-susceptible E. coli
isolates were determined as control.

Complementation Experiments
The wild-type mgrB and pmrB genes from an E. coli reference
strain ATCC 25922 (colistin MIC of 0.25 µg/ml) were ampliﬁed
by PCR using primers EmgrB-F/EmgrB-R and EpmrB-F/EpmrB-
R, respectively. The non-coding mdh sequence was ampliﬁed
by PCR using primers described previously (Jayol et al., 2014).
The PCR products were cloned into the plasmid pCR-BluntII-
TOPO (Invitrogen) encoding resistance to kanamycin and
zeocin. The resulting plasmids pTOPO-mgrB, pTOPO-pmrB,
and pTOPO-mdh were separately transformed into E. coli TOP10
strains by electroporation. Transformants were selected by on
Mueller–Hinton agar supplemented with 50 mg/L of kanamycin.
The recombinant plasmids were isolated and transformed into
electrocompetent colistin-resistant E. coli with mgrB mutation
(pTOPO-mgrB) or E. coli with pmrB mutation (pTOPO-
pmrB) via electroporation. The transformants were selected on
Mueller–Hinton agar supplemented with zeocin (25 mg/L) and
the presence of the cloned gene was conﬁrmed by PCR. The
colistin MICs of the transformants were determined by the agar
dilution method.

RESULTS

Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Overall, 4089 commensal E. coli collected from 973 chickens
on farm, 1392 pigs on farm, 325 chickens at slaughter, 1063

pigs at slaughter, and 336 cows on farm during 2013–2014 were
recovered from 4888 samples. Among them, 763 (18.7%) isolates
showed resistance to colistin (MIC ≥ 4 mg/L) (Table 1). The
MIC values were shown in Figure 1. MICs of most isolates
(75.2%) were distributed at 0.25 mg/L–0.5 mg/L, followed by
4 mg/L–8 mg/L (16.8%). Only MICs of 6.1% isolates and 1.9%
isolates were distributed at 1 mg/L–2 mg/L and ≥16 mg/L,
respectively.

There was a high frequency of colistin resistance in E. coli
from pigs on farm (24.1%) and at slaughter (24.3%), followed
by chickens on farm (14.0%) and at slaughter (9.5%). The
resistance frequency of cow isolates was the lowest (0.9%).
Compared with the isolates recovered during 2013-2014, E. coli
isolates collected during 2007–2008 and 2010–2011 showed
signiﬁcantly lower frequency of colistin resistance (P < 0.05,
Table 1).

Of the 258 colistin resistant isolates from pig at slaughter,
76.7% showed resistance to 3–9 other antimicrobial agents,
including tetracycline (93.8%), ampicillin (79.5%), ﬂorfenicol
(64.3%), cefotaxime (13.2%), neomycin (56.6%), gentamicin
(29.1%), ciproﬂoxacin (28.3%), apramycin (12.4%), fosfomycin
(7.8%), and amikacin (0.4%) (Table 2). The frequencies of
antimicrobial resistance to other antimicrobial agents among
colistin resistant isolates were signiﬁcantly higher than those of
colistin susceptible isolates (P < 0.01), except to amikacin and
gentamicin. All of the isolates were susceptible to imipenem.

mcr-1 Detection and Sequence of pmrA,
pmrB, and mgrB Genes
Of the 200 randomly seiected colistin-resistant isolates, 182
(91.0%) were positive for mcr-1. The sequences of the pmrA,
pmrB, and mgrB genes known to be involved in polymyxin
resistance were determined in 50 isolates. For PmrA, no amino
acid substitution was observed among the 50 isolates except
one isolate that had the G144S substitution. However, G144S
substitution was found to be present in colistin-susceptible

regions possessed D31G substitution. For PmrB, one isolate had
two amino acid substitutions (T246I and D282N). However, the
MICs of colistin remained unchanged upon transformation with
plasmid pTOPO-mgrB or pTOPO-pmrB.

DISCUSSION

Despite the frequent use of colistin in animal farming for over
50 years, the occurrence of colistin resistance among E. coli
strains isolated from food animals remains low (<1%) (Kempf
et al., 2013; Kieﬀer et al., 2015). However, in this study, we
found a very high prevalence of colistin resistance (18.7%) among
commensal E. coli isolates from food animals, especially pigs.
The frequency of resistance in commensal intestinal E. coli is
considered to be a good marker for the selection pressure exerted
by antibiotic use in the host animals and the resistance problems
to be predicted in pathogenic bacteria (van den Bogaard and
Stobberingh, 2000). This high prevalence of colistin resistance
may be due to the increasing use of colistin in food animals
in recent years. Our previous studies showed that most E. coli
strains from chicken and pigs in China showed resistance to
ﬂuoroquinolones and ﬂorfenicol, and over 20% isolates exhibited
resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, amikacin and
fosfomycin (Chen et al., 2014; Rao et al., 2014). Thus, in recent
years, the lack of eﬀective drugs against E. coli might be attributed
by the increased consumption of colistin in veterinary medicine,
especially in piglets which are frequently treated with colistin
sulphate for colibacillosis. This high selective pressure might
result in the highest prevalence (64.7%) of colistin resistance
among E. coli isolates from weaned piglets found in this study.
Compared with pig and chicken isolates, the prevalence of
colistin resistance among E. coli from cows was very low (0.9%)
which might be associated with the infrequent use of this drug on
dairy-farm.

To determine whether there was an increase of colistin
isolates collected in

resistance from 2007 to 2014, E. coli

our previous study were reviewed for colistin resistance. By
comparison, colistin resistance among E. coli
isolated from
chicken raised nearly three times from 2007/2008 to 2013/2014
and that among E. coli isolated from pigs raised nearly two
times from 2010/2011 to 2013/2014. Though we could not obtain
the amount of colistin consumption on each farm sampled
in this study, data from China Veterinary Drug Association
showed that the volume of colistin sales increased signiﬁcantly
from 2011 to 2013 (China Veterinary Drug Association, 2014).
Taken together, our results revealed that colistin resistance
in food animals was correlated with the consumption of
colistin.

Interestingly, MICs of most colistin- resistant isolates were
4 or 8 mg/L. The emergence and spread of E. coli with
low level of colstin resistance (MIC = 4 or 8) might
lead to the treatment
failure of diarrhea with standard
colistin dosage (2–20 mg/kg, ppm). Thus, farmers have to
illegally use medicated feed added with increased dosage of
colistin (80–100 ppm) to prevent diarrhea in piglets (personal
communication).

Colistin resistance among commensal E.

isolates
recovered from pigs at slaughter was also worrisomely high.
These resistant bacteria might contaminate meat during
slaughtering procedures and transfer to humans by food
chain or to workers via direct animal contact as indicated
in some previous studies (Angulo et al., 2004; Liebana et al.,
2013). Recently, several studies suggested the possibility of the
transference MCR-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae to humans
via food chain (Campos et al., 2016; Carnevali et al., 2016;
Figueiredo et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017b). Hence it is urgent to
limit the usage of polymyxins (colistin) in veterinary medicine
especially as feed additives in China. Fortunately, following our
discovery of mcr-1, the Chinese Government has banned the use
of colistin in animal feed since Nov 1, 2016 (Walsh and Wu,
2016).

coli

Similar to our previous results, colistin resistance is mainly
caused by mcr-1 gene. Quesada et al. have recently found
mutations in PmrAB that confer resistance to polymyxins in
E. coli (Quesada et al., 2014). However, in this study, we failed to
detect any meaningful mutation in pmrAB and mgrB conferring
resistance to colistin. Further studies are needed to understand
the possible mechanism mediating colistin resistance among
mcr-1-negative isolates.

CONCLUSION

We have detected a high prevalence of colistin resistance and
mcr-1 gene in E. coli
from food animals. Though colistin
exhibited high antimicrobial activities against GNB, including
E. coli, A. baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, and
K. pneumonia in human (Chen et al., 2015), the frequent presence
of mcr-1-positive E. coli and in food animals might be a threat to
human. As colistin is the last therapeutic option against infections
caused by MDR GNB, careful monitoring of the evolution of
colistin resistance and the spread of mcr-1 gene in isolates from
humans in China is urgently needed.
