This study examined socioeconomic and cultural factors relating to animal husbandry, antimicrobial usage and
household hygiene in 320 animal-keeping households of 16 rural and peri-urban communities of Ogun State,
Nigeria. The occurrence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in 457 samples from
animal and environmental sources within the households was investigated. Chickens (41.6%), goats (35.3%),
dogs (33.8%) and sheep (14.4%) were the most common household animals. Animals were reared mainly for
income generation (73.9%) and for household consumption (18.3%). They were reared predominantly
(60.2%–100%) under the extensive system with unrestricted access to human space, cooking utensils and foods.
Households were assessed as having good (59.4%), fair (22.2%) and poor (18.4%) hygiene. The rate of
household non-prescriptional antimicrobial usage was 69.4% in humans and 60.6% in animals. Overall, ESBL-
producing Enterobacteriaceae were detected in 53 (11.6%) of 457 samples. The ESBL-producing isolates were
identiﬁed as Escherichia coli (n = 49) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4). They harboured the ESBL gene variants
blaCTX-M-15 (n = 49), blaCTX-M-14 (n = 2), blaCTX-M-27 (n = 1) or blaCTX-M-55 (n = 1). Forty-eight ESBL-producing E.
coli were assigned into phylogenetic groups A (n = 17), B1 (n = 14), D (n = 13) and F (n = 4). All ESBL-pro-
ducing isolates demonstrated multidrug resistance to antimicrobial agents belonging to at least three diﬀerent
classes of antimicrobials. Poor regulation of antimicrobial marketing and inadequate access to veterinary care
contributed to non-prescriptional use of antimicrobials in humans and animals. Free-range household animals
harboured ESBL-producing bacteria and may facilitate the dispersal of the organisms within the community.

1. Introduction

Household animal rearing is a common practice to augment family
income and serve as ready source of animal protein in many rural and
peri-urban areas of Nigeria as well as in other developing countries
(Pica-Ciamarra et al., 2011; Owolade et al., 2013). With household
animal rearing, humans live in very close contact with animals under
compromised hygiene conditions (Rwego et al., 2008). In most African
communities, household livestock is characterised by animals having
unrestricted access to human dwellings, cooking utensils, drinking
water and food meant for human consumption (Schriewer et al., 2015;
Ercumen et al., 2017). Direct and indirect contact with animals and
contaminated environment facilitate easy transmission of microorgan-
isms between humans and animals (Herrero et al., 2012). A great

proportion of household animals in the rural and peri-urban settings are
reared under the extensive and semi-intensive systems of management
where animals are exposed to diverse populations of microorganisms in
the environment (Adesehinwa et al., 2004; Maass et al., 2012; Malatji
et al., 2016). These free-roaming animals also contribute to environ-
mental contamination by shedding of microorganisms in the environ-
ment thus contributing to widespread dissemination of microorganisms
in the community (Ogden et al., 2009; Herrero et al., 2012).

. In Nigeria, livestock are kept predominantly under the subsistence,
small-scale extensive management system with low input from farmers
(Bourn et al., 1994; FAO, 2005; Pica-Ciamarra et al., 2011). Most of
these farmers live in the rural areas. The intensively managed pro-
duction system accounts for only 11% of total chicken population; 3%
of the pig population; and less than 1% of the cattle, sheep and goat

populations (Bourn et al., 1994). Administration of antimicrobial agents
is very crucial to the sustainability of rural and peri-urban household
animal rearing due to the high level of exposure to infectious agents
(Ojo et al., 2016a). Overdependence on antimicrobial agents and
misuse are the inevitable outcome of unrestricted access and poor
regulation of the use of antimicrobial agents. The β-lactam antibiotics
are among the most commonly used antibiotics in veterinary and
human medicine. These antibiotics are relatively cheap and safe with
very low toxicity compared to other classes of drugs. The emergence
and dissemination of extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing
bacteria with resistance to penicillins and new generation cephalos-
porins have reduced the beneﬁts derivable from the use of the β-lactam
antibiotics in the treatment of human and animal diseases. Due to the
close contact between animals and humans in households, there could
be an easy exchange of commensal as well as pathogenic ESBL-produ-
cing bacteria.

The present study investigated antimicrobial usage, sociocultural
and economic characteristics as well as the presence of ESBL-producing
Enterobacteriaceae in animal-keeping households in rural and peri-
urban communities of Ogun State, Nigeria. It also examined household
hygiene and the occurrence of diseases symptoms (especially diarrhoea)
in humans cohabiting with animals within the same households.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Study area

This study was carried out in selected rural and peri-urban com-
munities of Ogun State. Ogun State is located in the Southwestern re-
gion of Nigeria (Fig. 1). The main occupation of the people in the State
is farming with high preponderance of commercial livestock production
and subsistence household animal rearing. The State is divided into four
geopolitical zones, which are Egba, Ijebu, Remo and Yewa zones. Each
geopolitical zone consisted of people of similar cultural and ethnic

background. All the four zones were included in the study. The sam-
pling sites were identiﬁed and categorized into rural and peri-urban
communities. Categorization was based on population size, major
commercial activities, major occupations and means of livelihood,
lifestyle, availability of social amenities, nearness to major cities/me-
tropolitan centres and perceived level of civilization. In the context of
this study, a rural community is an area of less than 20,000 inhabitants
predominantly of agrarian lifestyle, usually characterised by poor social
amenities and poor living standard (Agbodike, 2010). A peri-urban
community is a transition area between rural and urban that is adjacent
to an urban centre and with ready means of transportation to the urban
centre (Mandere et al., 2010). In peri-urban community, there is a clash
of interest between traditional agricultural activities and alternative
economic, residential and recreational activities (Mandere et al., 2010).
A community is a group of people of common sociocultural character-
istics living together in a clearly demarcated geographical location
identiﬁable by a name and separated from other groups. Sixteen com-
munities, comprising eight rural and eight peri-urban communities
were included in the investigation. In each of the four zones, two rural
and two peri-urban communities were included in the study. The spe-
ciﬁc communities were chosen by balloting. In balloting, names of rural
and peri-urban communities in each zone were written in separate
pieces of paper and put in two boxes; one for rural and the other for
peri-urban. The pieces of paper in each box were shuﬄed and two
pieces were blindly picked out of the box. Thus, four names (including
two rural and two peri-urban) were picked from the two boxes for each
zone. The communities picked were included in the study. Within each
community, households were selected based on informed consent.
Every ﬁfth animal-keeping household in each community was ap-
proached for informed consent until the required number of household
was completed. Only animal-keeping households were approached to
obtain informed consent for participation in the study. In each house-
hold, the head of the household was informed about the study in the
local language.

2.2. Collection of socioeconomic/cultural samples

Focus group discussions (FGD), in-depth interviews, semi-structured
questionnaire and observational studies were employed to collect data
on knowledge, attitude and practices of animal keepers in relation to
antimicrobial usage, household hygiene, disease symptoms, and factors
that favour zoonotic transmission of bacteria between humans and
animals within animal-keeping households. Available members of the
household were involved in a focus group discussion before conducting
an in-depth interview with the head of the household or his/her dele-
gate. The information collected were grouped into eight categories as
follows: household characteristics/demographic data, animal manage-
ment practices, household hygiene, consumption of animal products,
accessibility to medical and veterinary care, prevailing health issues/
challenges, antimicrobial usage pattern (including knowledge, practices
and attitude on antimicrobial usage and knowledge of zoonoses) and
experience of antimicrobial therapeutic failure (Supplementary docu-
ment S1). In total, 320 households were investigated from the 16
communities.

2.3. Analysis of socioeconomic/cultural data

To determine the level of hygiene within households, the household
heads or the owners of animals within households were asked questions
about practices on personal hygiene while handling animals. The hy-
giene level was score based on eight questions on Likert scale of four
(Sullivan and Artino et al., 2013). Points obtainable for each choice
ranged from 0 to 3 (never = 0, rarely = 1, often = 2 and always = 3)
with a maximum of 24 obtainable points. Households where the re-
spondents scored 12 points or less were categorised as having poor level
of hygiene, those with 13–18 points were categorised as having fair
level of hygiene and those with 19–24 points were categorised as
having good level of hygiene. To assess the level of knowledge in re-
lation to antimicrobial usage and animal diseases, responses to a set of
25 questions were used for scoring. Among them, correct answers to
twenty-two questions were rated with either zero or one point, two
questions had 0–2.5 points while one question had 0–3 points. Alto-
gether, the maximum obtainable points for all the 25 knowledge-based
questions was 30. Based on the scores obtained, households were rated
as having poor (≤15 points), fair (16–20 points) or good knowledge
(≥20 points).

2.4. Statistical analysis

The data from the questionnaire was assessed for normality using a
skewness test. Continuous variables were expressed in terms of means
and standard deviations while categorical variables were presented in
frequencies and percentages. Associations between the hygiene scores
(dependent variable), demographic data (independent variables) and
source of information (independent variables) were assessed with a
negative binomial regression model. Spearman rho was used to de-
termine correlation of the presence of ESBL-producing bacteria versus
the hygiene score, antimicrobial usage in humans and animals, common
diseases in humans and animals, animal access to human habitations as
well as the presence of animal faeces in the environment in each of the
communities investigated. The prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria
among the diﬀerent animal species was compared using Chi-square test
and P values of ˂0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant. All data
were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software
(SPSS version 16).

2.5. Collection of biological samples

Biological samples were collected alongside with the socioeconomic
data from households. Biological samples included faecal samples from
dogs (n = 108), goats (n = 113), chickens (n = 101), sheep (n = 46),

Veterinary Microbiology 218 (2018) 31–39

pigs (n = 7), ducks (n = 5) and turkey (n = 9). Other were pigeons
(n = 2), guinea fowl (n = 2), cat (n = 1), monkey (n = 1) and rabbit
(n = 1). Faecal samples were collected directly from the rectum of
animals within the households using sterile swabs. Where possible,
samples were collected from all animal species within a household.
However, only one sample represented each species in every household.
The swabs were inoculated directly into 9 mL of buﬀered peptone water
(BPW). In addition, environmental samples including swabs of surfaces
of shared human/animal spaces (n = 15), samples of human foods
(n = 2), drinking water (n = 15), animal feeds (n = 9) as well as
human (n = 1) and animal excreta around houses (n = 18) were col-
lected. Five grams (solid samples) or one millilitre (liquid samples) of
sample was inoculated directly into nine millilitre of sterile buﬀered
peptone water (BPW). Animal and human excreta as well as swabs of
surfaces were collected based on observed environmental contamina-
tion while feed and water samples were obtained based on availability
within the household premises. The inoculated samples were appro-
priately labelled and preserved in ice-pack for transportation to the
laboratory. In total, 457 samples were collected from 320 households.
Both socioeconomic data for assessment of antimicrobial usage and
biological samples for detection of ESBL-producing bacteria were col-
lected simultaneously during the months of September to December
2016.

2.6. Selective isolation of putative ESBL-producing bacteria from biological
samples and conﬁrmatory tests for ESBL-producing bacteria

In the laboratory, the aforementioned samples in BPW were in-
cubated at 37 °C overnight for pre-enrichment (Jazmati et al., 2016). A
loopful of the BPW culture was inoculated onto MacConkey agar sup-
plemented with ampicillin (100 mg/L; Mac-AMP100). Inoculated plates
were incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h and examined for bacterial growth.
Both lactose fermenters and non-lactose fermenters on Mac-AMP100
were selected for further screening on MacConkey agar containing ce-
fotaxime supplement (1 mg/L; Mac-CTX1). Isolates that grew on both
selective agar media were suspected as ESBL-producers. These were
preserved in tryptic soy broth with glycerol and kept at −20 °C for
further studies.

Isolates recovered following the selective culture of samples on Mac-
AMP100 and Mac-CTX1 were tested for phenotypic ESBL-production
using the cefpodoxime/cefpodoxime-clavulanic combination discs test
kit (Oxoid DD0029) according to the manufacturer’s instruction and in
line with the recommendations of Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI, 2015).

2.7. Bacterial identiﬁcation

Initial bacterial identiﬁcation was based on cultural characteristics
of lactose and non-lactose fermentation on MacConkey agar. Further
identiﬁcation of phenotypic ESBL-producers into genera and species
was based on biochemical characterization using commercial bio-
chemical kit for the identiﬁcation of Gram negative bacteria (Microbact
GNB 24E, OxoidR, Basingstoke, UK) and the MALDI-TOF MS technique
using the MALDI Microﬂex LT (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany).

2.8. Phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing

ESBL-producing isolates were tested for susceptibility to ampicillin
(10 μg), cefotaxime (30 μg), ceftazidime (30 μg), kanamycin (30 μg),
gentamicin (10 μg), streptomycin (10 μg), amikacin (30 μg),
tetra-
cycline (30 μg), chloramphenicol (10 μg), nalidixic acid (30 μg), cipro-
ﬂoxacin (5 μg), trimethoprim (5 μg), compound sulfonamides (300 μg)
and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (25 μg) by the disk diﬀusion
method. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed on Mueller-
Hinton agar according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute
document VET01-A4 (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI,

2013). Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was included as quality control
strain.

2.9. Detection of ESBL genes and determination of E. coli phylogenetic
groups

Genomic DNA was extracted from overnight culture of bacterial
cells grown in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth by thermo-lysis as
previously described (Ojo et al., 2016b). The concentration of extracted
DNA was quantiﬁed by spectrophotometry (Thermo Scientiﬁc Nano-
DropR 1000 spectrophotometer). A ﬁnal DNA working concentration of
100 ng/μL was used for all PCR protocols. Isolates were screened for the
initial detection of blaCTX-M-group1, blaCTX-M-group9, blaSHV and blaTEM
genes (Olesen et al., 2004; Gröbner et al., 2009; Cullik et al., 2010) and
were further subjected to PCR assays for sequencing of the whole
blaSHV, blaCTX-M-group1 and blaCTX-M-group9 genes (Olesen et al., 2004;
Carattoli et al., 2008; Gröbner et al., 2009). In the presence of the genes
blaCTX-M-group1 or blaCTX-M-group9, the blaTEM and blaSHV genes were not
sequenced. Gene sequencing was done by LGC Genomic, Berlin, Ger-
many. The nucleotide sequences were analysed using the bioinformatics
software Geneious® 10.1.3 (Biomatters Limited, New Zealand). To de-
termine the ESBL gene variants, analysed sequences were subjected to
comparisons with reference sequences assigned at the Lahey Clinic
website (http://www.lahey.org) and deposited at the National Center
for Biotechnology (NCBI) website by using BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).

E. coli isolates were assigned to one of seven E. coli sensu stricto
phylogenetic groups (A, B1, B2, C, D, E, and F) using a PCR-based
method described by Clermont and colleagues (Clermont et al., 2013).

3. Results

3.1. Personal attributes of household animal keepers

The demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of household
animal keepers showed that out of the 320 respondents (one person for
each animal-keeping household), 173 (54.1%) were male and 147
(45.9%) were female indicating a fair representation of both sexes.
Concerning the age, about 70% of all the 320 household animal keepers
interviewed were within the working age group of 31–60 years. The
respondents were almost of homogeneous ethnicity being pre-
dominantly (88.1%) of Yoruba descent and were mostly married
(66.2%). Some of the respondents had no formal education (24.7%),
others had a primary (19.7%) only or with secondary (37.2%) educa-
tion. Only few respondents (18.4%) had post-secondary education. The
most common primary occupations among the respondents were
trading (32.2%), artisan (20.6%) and farming (20.0%). Other primary
occupations were civil service (5.9%), teaching (9.4%), food processing
(3.1%),
(3.8%).
Concerning monthly income, 36.6% of the respondents earned less than
the national minimum wage of 18,000 naira (which corresponds to
€50) monthly while 42.8% earned above the minimum wage. Sixty-six
(20.6%) respondents did not declare their monthly income. Only 24
(7.5%) indicated to be members of cooperative groups and trade/social
associations.

3.2. Types of animals reared in households

The most commonly reared animals within household settings in the
study areas were chickens (41.6%), goats (35.3%), dogs (33.8%), sheep
(14.4%) and cattle (5.0%) (Table 1). Animals were reared pre-
dominantly under the extensive system of management and for eco-
nomic purposes to generate income (Table 1). Animals were also reared
as sources of food for household consumption, to oﬀer sacriﬁces to
deities, gifts for families and friends and for companionship. In the
extensive system of management, animals were left to freely roam

about and fend for themselves with only minimal input from the
owners. Free-range scavenging animals in the extensive management
system had access to human space, cooking utensils and foods thereby
contributing to environmental pollution. Under the semi-intensive
management system, animals were tethered within a grazing area
usually near the household or allowed to roam about in search of food
during the day but led to makeshift shelters at night. There were oc-
casional veterinary care and supplementary feeding to augment nutri-
tional supply. Intensive management entails complete conﬁnement of
animals within a pen with provision of veterinary care, feed and water.

3.3. Waste disposal methods and availability of toilet facilities in households

Waste disposal methods were generally inadequate. Two hundred
and twenty-four households (70.0%) dumped wastes in open spaces
near the house, 36 (11.8%) dumped their wastes in communal dung-
hills, while 60 (18.8%) utilised the services of government or private
waste collectors that regularly collect waste from residential buildings.
Available toilet facilities for household use included water closets
(36.9%), pit latrines (51.2%) and communal toilets (2.5%). Thirty
households (9.4%) did not have toilet facilities but members defaecated
in bushes near their houses.

3.4. Personal hygiene within households

Household members practiced some form of personal hygiene
measures such as regular hand washing with soap after handling ani-
mals (55.6%), after sneezing (55.6%), after visiting the toilet (69.4%),
before and after cooking (56.9%) and after slaughtering animals
(65.3%). However, only 78 (24.4%) households regularly cleaned an-
imal pens. Overall, 190 (59.4%) households had good, 71 (22.2%) had
fair and 59 (18.4%) had poor standards of hygiene. The mean knowl-
edge score on household hygiene was 15.27 ± 6.41 out of a maximum
of 24 obtainable points. The hygiene score was signiﬁcantly associated
(p ≤ 0.01) with Local Government Area (LGA), age, marital status,
education, ethnicity and source of information. The strongest positive
predictor of hygiene score was being from Yewa-South LGA followed by
obtaining information on animal health from veterinary personnel
(Supplementary document S2).

3.5. Household antimicrobial usage

(37.5%),

(26.6%),

amoxicillin

Antimicrobial usage was common (100%) among human members
of all the 320 animal-keeping households investigated. Antimicrobials
were used in humans for the treatment (33.8%) and prevention (19.7%)
of diseases or for both therapeutic and preventive purposes (46.5%).
Commonly used antimicrobials in humans include ampicillin (38.4%),
ampicillin/cloxacillin
penicillin
(26.9%),
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
(22.2%), chloramphenicol (10.9%) and ciproﬂoxacin (9.1%) (Table 2).
Two hundred and twenty-two (69.4%) of 320 households indicated that
they had purchased antimicrobials for use in humans without pre-
scription from a physician. Antimicrobials were purchased based on the
occurrence of familiar symptoms of diseases or past experience of drug
eﬃcacy when used in the treatment of disease symptoms. One hundred
and sixty (50.0%) households would keep antimicrobials packages and
labels for future need.

tetracycline

(28.1%),

This study showed that 206 (64.4%) of 320 households adminis-
tered antimicrobials to their animals. Antimicrobials were used for the
prevention (25.0%) and treatment (23.1%) of diseases as well as for
growth promotion (16.3%) purposes. The following are some of the
antimicrobials administered to household animals: long acting oxyte-
tracycline
tetracycline
(8.4%), ampicillin (6.9%) and ampicillin/cloxacillin (5.3%) (Table 2).
One hundred and ninety-four (60.6%) of 320 households indicated that
in animals without prescription by a
they used antimicrobials

(10.0%), penicillin/streptomycin (7.8%),

veterinarian. One hundred and seventy (53.1%) households agreed that
prescription by a veterinarian is necessary before antimicrobial usage in
animals while 150 (46.9%)
think veterinary prescription is not

necessary before antimicrobial usage.

The mean knowledge score on antimicrobial usage was 15.0 ± 5.0
out of 30 maximum obtainable points. The knowledge scores on anti-
microbials and antimicrobial usage was
signiﬁcantly associated
(p ≤ 0.01) with Local Government Area, marital status and sources of
information (Table 3). Livestock owners from Yewa South and Remo
North LGAs or those from Odeda, Porogun, Ososa and Isiwo villages
scored high on knowledge. Livestock owners who sourced information
on animal health from internet, fully divorced or monogamous (if
married), had a low knowledge score.

3.6. Household access to human and veterinary healthcare

Two hundred and sixty (81.3%) of 320 households indicated that
there was at least a human medical centre/hospital within their vicinity
of about 30 km while 286 (89.4%) indicated that there was at least one
pharmacy/patent medicine store in their community. However, only
200 (62.5%) households would go to human medical centre/hospital
for medical services. Sources of help for healthcare services included

patent medicine stores (21.9%), homemade remedies including herbal
preparations (14.1%) and spiritual healers (1.8%). One hundred and
one (31.6%) of the 320 households indicated that no human member of
their household had sought or received medical care from a medical
centre/hospital within the past ﬁve years.

Many of the households never (51.5%) or rarely (23.1%) have ac-
cess to veterinary services for their animals. Two hundred and twenty-
eight (71.3%) of the households indicated that they had no veterinary
drug store in their community. When animals showed signs of illness,
such sick animals were slaughtered and consumed by household
members (20.6%), sold to butchers/meat processor for slaughter and
the meat sold for public consumption (15.0%), treated with anti-
microbials by household members without veterinary intervention
(18.4%), treated with herbs and other homemade remedies (8.1%) or
taken to a veterinary clinic (26.2%).

3.7. Disease occurrence in humans and animals

Commonly encountered disease symptoms in human members of
households included fever (18.8%), headache (17.8%), diarrhoea
(16.6%), general body pain (10.3%), joint pain (10.3%), abdominal
cramps (9.1%), coughing with chest pain (7.8%) and backache (7.5%).
Others were nasal discharges (4.1%), skin infections (3.8%), bloody
diarrhoea (3.4%), eye infections (2.8%), ear infections (2.8%), and
toothache (0.9%). At the time of sampling, 15 (4.7%) households in-
dicated that there were ongoing cases of diarrhoea in at least one
member of the household.

Common clinical signs of disease in animals include loss of appetite
(9.4%), diarrhoea (22.5%), dullness (5.9%), nasal discharges (6.3%),
wounds (7.5%), skin infections (5.3%), emaciation (2.5%), eye infec-
tions (6.3%) and paleness (3.4%). As at the time of sampling, 16 (5.0%)
households indicated that there was at least one diarrhoeic animal
among the animals in their households.

3.8. Detection of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae from biological
samples

Overall, phenotypic ESBL-producing coliform bacteria were de-
tected in 53 (11.6%) of 457 samples collected from 320 animal-keeping
households (Table 4). These include samples from Odeda (23.1%),
Ijebu-Ode (4.1%), Remo North (10.3%) and Yewa-South (9.0%) LGAs.
The 53 ESBL-producing isolates were obtained from diﬀerent sources
including the faeces of goats (20/113; 17.7%), dogs (15/108; 13.9%),
sheep (4/46; 8.7%), chickens (3/101; 3.0%), ducks (2/5; 40.0%),
turkey (1/9; 11.1%) and human (1/1; 100%) as well as from animal
excreta within and around human residences (6/18; 33.3%) and human
food (1/2; 50.0%) sources. There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the
prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria in goat, sheep and dogs. How-
ever, the prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria was signiﬁcantly
higher (p ˂ 0.05) in each of goats, sheep and dogs than in chickens. The
ESBL-producing isolates were identiﬁed as E. coli (n = 49) and Klebsiella
pneumoniae (n = 4). The detection of ESBL-producing bacteria in bio-
logical samples did not correlate with the hygiene score, antimicrobial
usage (in humans and animals), common diseases (in humans and an-
imals), animal access to human habitations and the presence of animal
faeces in the environment of households in all the communities in-
vestigated.

3.9. ESBL genes and E. coli phylogenetic groups

In this study, the ESBL-producing isolates harboured blaCTX-M-15
(n = 49), blaCTX-M-14 (n = 2), blaCTX-M-27 (n = 1) and blaCTX-M-55 (n = 1)
ESBL gene variants (Supplementary document S3). The blaCTX-M-14
variant was detected in E. coli isolates from a chicken in Odeda, Odeda
LGA and a duck in Ajilete, Yewa-South LGA. The blaCTX-M-27 was de-
tected in an E. coli isolate from chicken in Osielle, Odeda LGA while the

blaCTX-M-55 was detected in an E. coli isolate from a duck in Ijoku-Ososa,
Ijebu-Ode LGA. In addition, blaTEM and blaSHV genes were detected in
29 and 3 isolates respectively. The blaTEM gene was present in E. coli
(n = 26) and K. pneumoniae (n = 3). The blaSHV gene was found only in
K. pneumoniae isolates (n = 3). In the presence of blaCTX-M, the ESBL
status of both blaTEM and blaSHV genes was not determined.

Forty-eight ESBL-producing E. coli isolates belonged to phylogenetic
groups A (n = 17), B1 (n = 14), D (n = 13) and F (n = 4) while the
phylogenetic group of one E. coli isolate could not be determined
(Supplementary document S3). E. coli of phylogenetic group A were
detected in goats (n = 5), dogs (n = 4), sheep (n = 2), chickens
(n = 3), an environmental sample (n = 1), a duck (n = 1) and a turkey
(n = 1). Phylogenetic group B1 isolates were from goats (n = 9), sheep
(n = 2), a chicken (n = 1), an environmental sample (n = 1) and a
human food sample (n = 1). Phylogenetic group D isolates were de-
tected in goats (n = 5), dogs (n = 7), and an environmental sample
(n = 1) while phylogenetic group F isolates originated from a goat
(n = 1) and dogs (n = 3).

3.10. Antimicrobial resistance

In addition to being resistant to the β-lactam antibiotics (ampicillin,
cefotaxime and ceftazidime), all ESBL-producing isolates were resistant
to tetracycline. They also showed varying percentages of resistance to
streptomycin (73.6%), nalidixic acid (84.9%), sulfamethoxazole/tri-
methoprim (81.1%), compound sulfonamides (81.1%), trimethoprim
(83.0%), gentamicin (35.8%), chloramphenicol (37.7%), ciproﬂoxacin
(28.3%), kanamycin (20.8%) and amikacin (9.4%). All the ESBL-pro-
ducing isolates demonstrated multidrug resistance to at least three
antimicrobial agents belonging to diﬀerent classes of antimicrobials
(Supplementary document S3).

4. Discussion

Animal owners in many households demonstrated low level of
knowledge on antimicrobials and their usage. This could lead to pro-
blems such as wrong indication for antimicrobial, over- and under-

36

dosing as well as poor storage and mishandling of antimicrobial agents.
Awareness about antimicrobial resistance and possible transmission of
antimicrobial resistant bacteria between humans and animals was poor
among household animal owners. Hence, there were no conscious ef-
forts by household animal owners to prevent the possible transmission
of microorganism between humans and animals. Human household
members engaged in unorthodox healthcare practices to treat disease
symptoms without taking advantage of the government healthcare fa-
cilities in the communities. Although medical centres were available in
the rural and peri-urban communities investigated, people preferred
self-medication and unconventional approaches (such as seeking help
from drug-store owners and attendants) in the treatment of diseases.
Non-prescriptional antimicrobial usage was a very common practice
among humans in the communities. Antimicrobial drugs could be
readily purchased from drug stores in the communities without pre-
scription. This unrestricted access to antimicrobial agents constitute a
major challenge to prudent antimicrobial usage and requires better
regulations including establishment of national programme for mon-
itoring of antimicrobial usage as well as proper enforcement of existing
legislatures with appropriate penalties for oﬀenders. Antimicrobial
usage in animals was less reported than in humans. Unlike in human
medicine, access to veterinary services and veterinary drug stores was
limited in the communities. Hence, animal owners administered human
antimicrobial preparations to their animals. Regrettably, in many oc-
casions, sick animals were culled by slaughter for household or public
consumption. Slaughtering sick animals for human consumption after
initial
the
withdrawal periods) could lead to the consumption of antimicrobial
residues deposited in animal tissues by humans and exposure of the gut
microﬂora to sub-therapeutic doses of antimicrobials. This could lead to
health hazards including development of antimicrobial resistance in the
exposed microﬂora and allergic reactions.

treatment with antimicrobials (without observation of

Phenotypic ESBL-production was detected in bacteria from animals,
environmental and food sources within households of rural and peri-
urban communities. The prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli varied
among the animal species. This could be due to the divergence in
sample sizes from these species. However, ﬁndings from this study
suggest that goats, sheep and dogs are more important as carriers of
ESBL-producing E. coli than chickens within the study area. An earlier
study has reported low detection rate of ESBL-producing E. coli in
chickens from Ogun State, Nigeria (Ojo et al., 2016b). Thus, it will be
instructive to pay more attention to goats, dogs and sheep as vehicles
for zoonotic transmission of ESBL-producing bacteria in rural and peri-
urban household settings. Any preventive strategy for the prevention of
household zoonotic transmission and environmental dissemination of
ESBL-producing bacteria in rural and peri-urban communities can
target these three species. Unfortunately, samples could not be col-
lected from humans because of cultural practices and superstitious
beliefs of the people. However, an ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae that
harboured blaCTX-M-15 was isolated from faecal sample of an apparently
healthy child in a household. The detection of ESBL-producing bacteria
was highest in animals from Odeda LGA. Thus, people from Odeda LGA
are likely to be more exposed to the risk of acquiring ESBL-producing
bacteria from household animals than people from other LGAs in-
vestigated in this study. The detection of ESBL-producing bacteria was
lowest in Ijebu-Ode LGA implying a comparative lower risk of house-
hold exposure to ESBL-producing bacteria of animal origins among
people from Ijebu-Ode LGA than in people from other three LGAs.
Studies on the molecular basis of ESBL-production in bacteria from
Nigerian animal populations are scarce (Olowe et al., 2015; Ojo et al.,
2016b). Most of the earlier studies only reported the phenotypic de-
tection of ESBL-producing bacteria in samples of animal origins without
investigating the genetic determinants of the ESBL traits (Chah and
Oboegbulem, 2007; Ugwu et al., 2015). The present study is the ﬁrst
comprehensive study detailing the ESBL gene variants in caprine, ovine,
avian and canine species as well as in food, environmental and human

samples in Nigeria. The blaCTX-M-15 variant was the most commonly
encountered being present in all sample categories and in the two en-
teric bacterial species (E. coli and K. pneumoniae) across the 12 diﬀerent
geographical locations in Ogun State, Nigeria. Other ESBL-gene variants
detected in this study were blaCTX-M-14, blaCTX-M-27 belonging to the
blaCTX-M group 9 and blaCTXM-55 in the blaCTX-M group 1. ESBL-producing
Enterobacteriaceae harbouring the blaCTXM-15 gene have been recovered
from clinical samples from humans in diﬀerent parts of Nigeria (Soge
et al., 2006; Iroha et al., 2011, 2012; Aibinu et al., 2012; Raji et al.,
2015) but the non-blaCTXM-15 ESBL variants have not been previously
reported in Nigeria. Globally, the blaCTXM-15 and blaCTXM-14 are among
the most frequently reported ESBL-gene variants and have been re-
ported in samples of human and animal origins (Carattoli, 2008). The
blaCTXM-15 tends to be more predominant in humans than in animals
(Carattoli, 2008; Valentin et al., 2014). Other studies have identiﬁed
blaCTXM-14, blaCTXM-55, and blaCTXM-27
from animals
(Carattoli, 2008; Sun et al., 2010).

in samples

lifestyle and pathogenic potentials of E. coli

Phylogenetic classiﬁcation is very useful in determining the ecolo-
gical niche,
isolates
(Clermont et al., 2015). In this study, the most frequently encountered
phylogenetic groups were A (35.4%) and B1 (29.2%). Most E. coli iso-
lates belonging to phylogroups A and B1 exist as commensals (Smith
et al., 2007). Nevertheless, intestinal pathogenic E. coli may belong to
phylogroups A and B1 (Mellata, 2013). A considerable proportion of
ESBL-producing E. coli from this study belonged to phylogroup D
(27.1%). Escherichia coli phylogroups B2 (F) and D are the most fre-
quently associated with clinical infections in humans (Bingen et al.,
1998; Mellata, 2013; Smati et al., 2013). Only ESBL-producing E. coli
isolates from goats and dogs were assigned to phylogroups D and F.
These two animal species were among the four most commonly reared
animals species in investigated households and had relatively high
prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria compared to all the animal
species investigated. Therefore, the presence of potentially human pa-
thogenic E. coli phylogroups in these two species could be a reﬂection of
their level of contact with human household members and their im-
portance in the dissemination of pathogenic ESBL-producing E. coli in
rural and peri-urban communities.

The ESBL-producing isolates showed high degrees of resistance to
tested antimicrobials similar to the reports of earlier workers in non-
ESBL producing E. coli from large scale livestock operations and sub-
sistence household animals sources within the study area (Ogunleye
et al., 2008; Amosun et al., 2012; Ojo et al., 2012; 2014). All the isolates
were multidrug resistant with resistance to more than three anti-
microbials of diﬀerent classes (Schwarz et al., 2010). Indiscriminate use
of antimicrobial agents as observed in the present study may create
selective pressure for the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria
strains. In Nigeria, indiscriminate use of antimicrobial is common in
both commercial and subsistence animal production systems (Adesokan
et al., 2015; Adebowale et al., 2016; Ojo et al., 2017).

The present study focused on blaCTX-M without further investigating
blaTEM and blaSHV. Hence, the ESBL status of the blaTEM and blaSHV genes
was not determined. The blaCTX-M ESBL is more widely distributed
across diﬀerent hosts range and geographical regions than blaTEM and
blaSHV (Carattoli, 2008). The use of cefotaxime as the sole selective
agent in screening samples for the phenotypic detection of ESBL-pro-
ducing bacteria introduced a form of limitation to this study. Screening
of samples on cefotaxime selective medium without corresponding use
of ceftazidime in the screening process may favour the detection of
blaCTX-M type ESBL-producing strains over non-blaCTX-M types such as
blaTEM and blaSHV. In the absence of blaCTX-M, cefotaxime is limited in
selecting for isolates that possessed blaTEM and blaSHV ESBL variants.
CTX-M enzymes hydrolyse cefotaxime more readily while TEM and
SHV enzymes have higher aﬃnity for ceftazidime (Bush and Jacoby,
2010).

In conclusion, this study showed that the degree of household an-
timicrobial usage as reported by farmers was higher in humans than in

37

animals probably because the people had more access to human drugs
than veterinary drugs. Free-roaming animals contributed to the dis-
persal of multidrug resistant ESBL-producing bacteria in the community
through faecal shedding and environmental contamination. Close con-
tact between humans and animals, poor household waste disposal
methods, poor environmental sanitation and other related factors could
facilitate the exchange of antimicrobial resistant bacteria between
human and animal household members. Findings from the present
study showed that obtaining information on animal health from ve-
terinary personnel signiﬁcantly improved the household hygiene score
emphasizing the importance of veterinary personnel as veritable source
of information that may be useful in promoting hygienic practices to-
wards prevention of zoonoses in rural and peri-urban animal-keeping
households. Improved access to veterinary service could lead to im-
proved household hygiene and reduced the risk of zoonotic exchange of
bacteria between animals and humans through unhygienic practices.
Therefore, veterinary services should be promoted and made accessible
to rural and peri-urban animal owners. There should be establishment
of national antimicrobial monitoring programme to document and as-
sess the marketing and consumption of antimicrobial agents including
quantity and reasons for antimicrobial usage in humans and animals.
Moreover, there should be adequate enforcement of existing anti-
microbial legislatures to ensure strict compliance.
