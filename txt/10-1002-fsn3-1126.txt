Abstract
Salmonella enterica is a common foodborne pathogen responsible for major global 
health problems such as paratyphoid fever and gastroenteritis. Here, we report the 
prevalence, antibiotic resistance phenotypes, serotypes, and molecular subtyping of 
Salmonella isolated from eggs in Guangdong, China. Out of 1,000 egg samples, 54 
(5.40%) were positive. S. Enteritidis made up the largest proportion of samples with 
11 serotypes. Antimicrobial susceptibility test indicated that most strains were re-
sistant to β-lactam, aminoglycoside, and tetracycline antibiotics (27.00%–40.00%). 
There were 37 STs based on MLST typing. MLST and ERIC-PCR classified 54 isolates 
into three and five clusters, respectively, which revealed the genetic relatedness and 
diversity. In conclusion, frequent monitoring of eggs for Salmonella, antibiotic resist-
ance profiles and genetic diversity is essential for improving food safety.

1 |  INTRODUCTION

Salmonella  enterica  is  a  major  foodborne  pathogen  that  infects 
approximately  9  million  people  worldwide  and  is  responsible  for 
155,000  deaths  annually,  causing  serious  economic  losses  (Huang 
et al., 2016; Li, Ye, et al., 2017). It is well known that this pathogen is 
mainly spread by unsafe handling of uncooked animal food products 
including egg, chicken, and pork (Gillespie, O'Brien, Adak, Ward, & 
Smith, 2005; Wang et al., 2012). As an important foodborne patho-
gen  in  China,  Salmonella  was  responsible  for  approximately  70%–
80%  of  foodborne  pathogenic  outbreaks  (Wang,  Zheng,  &  Wang, 
2007). Typhoidal Salmonella causes severe and life-threatening dis-
eases, while nontyphoidal Salmonella is associated with self-limiting 
diseases such as gastroenteritis, but still severe systemic infections 
occur in infants, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals 
(Ceyssens, Mattheus, Vanhoof, & Bertrand, 2015).

Tengfei Xie and Gang Wu contributed equally to this work and should be considered 
co-first authors. 

In  recent  decades,  antimicrobial  resistance  has  emerged  and 
evolved in many bacterial as the excessive use of antimicrobials in 
human and aquaculture systems (Kang et al., 2016; Li et al., 2013). 
The  emergence  of  antimicrobial  resistance  in  Salmonella  to  antibi-
otics  such  as  ampicillin,  chloramphenicol,  and  cotrimoxazole  will 
further complicate the treatment and management of enteric fever 
(Ejaz et al., 2017). Strains that have been detected are resistant to 
some  clinical  first-line  antibiotics  used  in  the  treatment  of  severe 
Salmonella infections (Boonkhot, Tadee, & Patchanee, 2015). As an-
tibiotic-resistant  bacteria  can  be  directly  transmitted  through  the 
food chain or transfer their antimicrobial resistance to human patho-
gens by mobile genetic elements, it is important to monitor antibiotic 
resistance among Salmonella isolates and control the risk.

Serotyping is a phenotypic characteristic that is a useful epidemi-
ological marker for Salmonella. More than 2,600 serotypes have been 
reported (Abbott, Ni, & Janda, 2012). The prevalence of Salmonella 
serovars  in  different  countries  also  varies  over  time  and  regions. 
For example, Salmonella Enteritidis is the most common serovar in

the United States. Furthermore, some serovars are also more dan-
gerous. For example, S. enterica serotype Typhimurium, which can 
cause various symptoms include diarrheal disease (Andrews & Ryan, 
2015;  El-Tayeb,  Ibrahim,  Al-Salamah,  Almaary,  &  Elbadawi,  2017). 
Molecular  subtyping  of  Salmonella  is  effective  for  epidemiological 
investigations  of  infections  and  outbreaks.  Multilocus  sequence 
typing  (MLST)  is  a  good  method  based  on  sequence  analysis  of 
some  housekeeping  genes.  Given  its  high  repeatability  in  globally 
dispersed laboratories, MLST is becoming an important method in 
the  investigation  of  various  pathogens  including  Salmonella  (Yang 
et  al.,  2015).  Researchers  have  found  that  many  bacteria  contain 
conserved  repetitive  intergenic  consensus  sequences,  which  have 
proven to be useful for subtyping pathogens. As a PCR-based finger-
printing technique, ERIC-PCR is easy, fast, and relatively cheap (Li, 
Liu, Li, Xu, & Zheng, 2017).

As eggs are a popular food and Guangdong is an economic center 
in south China with more than 110 million people, it is essential for 
us to understand the prevalence of S. enterica in this region. So far, 
little is known of the distribution of strains among eggs. The aim of 
our study was to determine the antimicrobial resistance, serotype, 
and genetic diversity of S. enterica in eggs from Guangdong, China. 
The  information  generated  in  this  study  will  aid  in  evaluating  the 
prevalence and population of S. enterica to ensure egg safety.

2 |  MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 | Sample collection, culture of Salmonella

From June 2017 to June 2018, we collected 1,000 egg samples from 
farms and markets in Guangdong, China.

Isolation  and  identification  of  strains  were  carried  out  accord-
ing  to  previous  reports  (Yang  et  al.,  2015).  Briefly,  each  egg  was 
disinfected with 75% alcohol, the shell was carefully removed, and 
the egg yolks and whites were mixed. Then, 25 g of the sample was 
added to 225 ml of buffered peptone broth, and 1 ml of the solu-
tion was incubated in 10 ml of selenite cystine broth (SC) at 37°C 
and  10  ml  of  tetrathionate  brilliant  green  broth  (TTB)  at  42°C  for 
24 hr. The SC and TTB cultures were streaked onto xylose–lysine–
tergitol 4 (XLT4) selective agar plates and chromogenic Salmonella 
agar plates (37°C, 24 hr). Presumptive colonies were stabbed into 
a  triple  sugar  iron  slant  and  incubated  at  37°C  for  24  hr.  Typical 
Salmonella  phenotypes  were  further  confirmed  with  API  20E  test 
strips (BioMerieux French).

(gentamicin, GEN, 10 μg; kanamycin, KAN, 30 μg; streptomycin, SM, 
10 μg), quinolones (ciprofloxacin, CIP, 5 μg; nalidixic acid, NA, 30 μg), 
β-lactams (amoxicillin, AMC, 10 μg; ampicillin, AMP, 10 μg; cepha-
zolin, CEP, 30 μg; penicillin, PEN, 10 μg; piperacillin, PIP, 10 μg), and 
tetracyclines (minocycline, MIN, 30 μg; tetracycline, TET, 30 μg). The 
results were expressed as sensitive (S), intermediate (I), and resistant 
(R), following the methodology of the CLSI.

2.3 | Serotyping of Salmonella isolates

All  the  Salmonella  isolates  were  serotyped  by  agglutination  tests 
on  the  basis  of  somatic-O  and  H  antisera  in  accordance  with  the 
Kauffmanne–White scheme (Boonkhot et al., 2015).

2.4 | Molecular subtyping

The strains were analyzed by MLST using seven housekeeping genes: 
aroC, dnaN, hemD, hisD, purE, sucA, and thrA. The PCR conditions were 
taken  from  the  Salmonella  MLST  website  and  database  (http://mlst.
warwi ck.ac.uk/mlst/dbs/Sente rica/;  Jolley,  Chan,  &  Maiden,  2004). 
Each reaction mixture included the following (total volume, 25 ml): 2 
*PCR Mix (Qiagen), 12.5 μl; 1 μl each primer, dd H2O, 9.5 ml; and DNA 
template, 1 μl. The PCR conditions were as follows: 96°C for 5 min; 
35 cycles for 96°C for 1 min; 55°C for 1 min; 72°C for 1 min; and final 
extension at 72°C for 10 min. The products were sequenced on BGI 
instrument. The seven gene sequences were uploaded to the MLST 
database  for  comparison  to  get  allele  numbers  and  define  STs.  The 
MLST evolution tree was built using the Kimura-2-parameter in Mega 
6.0 (Tamura, Stecher, Peterson, Filipski, & Kumar, 2013).

We used the ERIC-PCR universal primers (ERIC1: 5-ATGTAAGCT 
CCTGGGGATTCAC-3  and  ERIC2:  5-AAGTAAGTGACTGGGGTGA 
GCG-3). The PCR reaction consisted of 12.5 μl 2* TaKaRa Taq Mix; 
1 μM  primers;  and  100  ng  template  DNA.  The  PCR  program  was 
as follows: denaturation at 95°C, 5 min; 35 cycles of 94°C for 45 s, 
52°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 3 min; and then 72°C for 10 min. The 
products were separated by electrophoresis (2.0% agarose gels) for 
40 min at 90 V. Cluster result analysis used a numerical taxonomy 
and multivariate analysis software package, based on Dice's similar-
ity coefficient (SD) (James Rohlf, 2000).

2.2 | Antimicrobial susceptibility

As  per  the  guidelines  of  the  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards 
Institute (CLSI, 2018), the susceptibility of the Salmonella isolates to 
antibiotic  was  examined  by  disk  diffusion.  Briefly,  Mueller–Hinton 
agar  and  a  panel  of  14  antibiotic  disks  were  selected  for  the  re-
sistance tests. These antibiotics are commonly used in agriculture 
and  life.  Them  can  cover  among  five  classes:  macrolides  (azithro-
mycin,  AZM,  15  μg;  erythromycin,  ERY,  15  μg),  aminoglycosides 

We isolated Salmonella from 54 (5.40%) out of 1,000 eggs. Of these, 
38 strains were from farms and 16 were from markets. The strains 
were	stored	at	−80°C	in	trypticase	soy	broth	(20%	glycerol).	All	posi-
tive samples and strains information are shown in Table S1.

ate, or resistant based on the diameter of inhibition zones around

antibiotic disks as specified by the CLSI. Ampicillin (AMP) resist-
ance was the most common with 32 (59.26%) resistant strains. As 
shown in Table 1, our strains were resistant to β-lactams antibi-
otic, including amoxicillin (37.04%), cephazolin (38.89%), penicillin 
(33.33%),  and  piperacillin  (29.63%).  Following  this,  similar  levels 
of  antibiotic  resistances  were  shown  by  isolates  to  aminoglyco-
sides  and  tetracyclines  antibiotics,  such  as  gentamicin  (18.52%), 
kanamycin (53.70%), streptomycin (27.78%), minocycline (31.48%), 
and  tetracycline  (42.59%)  were  similar.  Only  a  few  strains  were 
resistant  to  macrolides  and  quinolones  antibiotics,  for  example 
azithromycin (9.26%), erythromycin (7.41%), ciprofloxacin (9.26%), 
and nalidixic acid (12.96%). Of note, only six isolates were L193 to 

any of the tested antibiotics, and most isolates were resistant to 
more than three antibiotics (Table S1). In particular, three strains 
were resistant to seven antibiotics (SalE4, SalE24, SalE54), and one 
was resistant to eight (SalE13).

3.3 | Serotypes phenotype

Somatic -O and -H antisera agglutination serotyped the 54 Salmonella 
isolates  into  11  different  serovars  (Figure  1).  Their  distribution  is 
as follows: S. Agona (3), S. Derby (5), S. Enteritidis (14), S. Give (4), 
S. Heidelberg (2), S. Meleagridis (3), S. Pullorum (12), S. Rissen (5), 
S. Senftenberg (3), S. Typhimurium(2), and S. Weltevreden (1).

3.4 | Molecular diversity patterns

After  the  seven  housekeeping  gene  sequences  were  uploaded, 
the  alleles  were  numbered  and  the  isolates  were  assigned  to  37 
sequence  types  (STs)  according  to  the  Salmonella  database.  The 
numbers of each MLST locus were aroC: 29, dnaN: 27, hemD: 22, 
hisD: 28, purE: 24, sucA: 25, and thrA: 29. A minimum evolution tree 
was constructed using the concatenated sequences of each allele, 
as shown in Figure 2. The MLST results grouped the Salmonella iso-
lates into three clusters. ST3315 (SalE28) formed its own cluster, 
which was widely separated from the others on the evolutionary 
tree.

The results of ERIC-PCR analysis of the Salmonella isolates are 
shown in Figure 3. We found bands ranging in size from 100 bp to 
about 5,000 bp. The ERIC-PCR patterns revealed that our isolates 
could  be  divided  into  five  clusters  (A,  B,  C,  D,  and  E)  with  a  rela-
tive  similarity  coefficient  of  0.65.  Analysis  of  the  ERIC-PCR  found 
the isolates to be very diverse genetically. Meanwhile, the isolates 
belonging to clusters A and B were similar to the cluster in MLST typ-
ing, including SalE7, 9, 29, and 37. However, there was no evidence 

showing  a  relationship  between  source,  serotype,  and  antibiotic 
resistance.

4 |  DISCUSSION

Eggs  were  an  important  host  of  S.  enterica.  In  the  United  States 
alone, eggs were responsible for 80% of the 371 known Salmonella 
food poisoning cases from 1985 to 1999. In 2010, more than 2,000 
people in the United States contracted food poisoning from consum-
ing eggs contaminated with Salmonella. This led to the recall of more 
than  550  million  eggs  and  resulted  in  heavy  economic  losses  (Al, 
2004). In China, about 70% of bacterial food poisoning is caused by 
Salmonella, with eggs and egg products accounting for 90% of these 
(Wu, Qin, Shi, & Zheng, 2004). Our data found that 7.6% and 3.2% 
of farm and market egg samples were contaminated with Salmonella, 
respectively. The market eggs may have a lower positive rate due to 
stricter access rules. The results were also much lower than contami-
nation pork (41.8%) and other meats (Capuano, Mancusi, Capparelli, 
Esposito, & Proroga, 2013). For the egg samples, the contamination

rate  was  similar  to  that  seen  in  Iran  and  Shaanxi,  China  (Badouei, 
Ghalejooghi, & Madadgar, 2012; Wang et al., 2012). However, the 
data on the prevalence of Salmonella in eggs still show the risk of this 
organism infection and can be useful for control of egg consumption 
in China.

Resistance  to  different  antibiotics  has  increasingly  been  re-
ported in bacteria isolated from animals and humans and has be-
come an important global issue. In particular, there is widespread 
dissemination of antimicrobial-resistant strains among S. enterica 
(Hardjo  Lugito  &  Cucunawangsih,  2017;  Yang  et  al.,  2015).  Our 
susceptibility tests revealed the Salmonella isolates obtained from 
eggs were highly resistant to β-lactams antibiotic, especially ampi-
cillin. This resistance ratio coincides with many previous reports, 
finding  that  ampicillin  resistance  was  most  serious  in Salmonella 
from some Asian countries (Chiou et al., 2014). Resistance to ami-
noglycosides and tetracyclines may be related to the use of feed 

containing  large  amounts  of  these  antibiotics  in  chicken  farms. 
Resistance to quinolones is also increasing along with prevalence 
of the resistance genes (Ben et al., 2017). Our isolates also showed 
resistance to other antibiotics including azithromycin (AZM) and 
erythromycin (ERY), which is a public health concern as these drugs 
are often used to treat human infections. In addition, many of the 
strains were multidrug resistant (MDR) with some even being re-
sistant to more than seven antibiotics. Wang et al also showed that 
84.6% of the Salmonella isolates from Shanghai, China, exhibited 
MDR and proved that resistance genes play an important role in 
MDR (Wang et al., 2017). Our findings indicate that it is necessary 
to continue monitoring the antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella 
isolates to help determine the appropriate antimicrobial therapy 
for patients infected with this pathogen.

Salmonella  enterica  has  a  wide  variety  of  serotypes,  and  their 
distribution has strong regional variation. There are differences in 

XIE Et al.2852  |    

the prevalence of Salmonella all over the world, but most common 
are  Salmonella  Enteritidis,  Salmonella  Typhimurium,  and  Salmonella 
Pullorum  (Batista  et  al.,  2015).  For  example,  S.  Senftenberg  has 
been proved to be the dominant serovar in cooked meat products 
in Chinese Henan province (Yu, Jiang, Zhou, Wu, & Wu, 2014). The 
various serotypes have different virulence characteristics. Serotype 
Enteritidis is mainly transmitted through contaminated meat and egg 
products, which is the primary cause of human salmonellosis (Foley 
et al., 2011). This serotype was also the most widespread in our study 
(Figure 1). Serotype Typhi is defined as often being resistant to some 
first-line recommended antibiotics (Hardjo Lugito & Cucunawangsih, 
2017). There are 11 serovars found in our Salmonella isolates. These 
serovars have also been frequently isolated from different sources in 
China (Gong et al., 2014). S. Pullorum, which formed a large propor-
tion of the isolates, are similar to strains isolated from gastroenteritis 
(Luo, Yi, Yao, Zhu, & Qin, 2017). As Salmonella serovars are closely 
related to pathogenicity, it is necessary to monitor changes in their 
distribution.

Molecular subtyping is widely used to analyze genetic diversity. 
MLST divided the Salmonella isolates into three clonal groups from 
different  sources,  which  differed  in  all  seven  alleles  profiled.  We 
found that diverse STs mean that the isolates originated from more 
than  one  common  ancestor  and  possess  several  distantly  related 
STs. In the database, our STs were first isolated from diverse sources. 
For example, ST31, ST39, and ST40 were from pig farms, pig slaugh-
terhouses, retail markets, and humans in China (Zheng et al., 2017). 
ST533, ST813, and ST640 were from clinics in Ethiopia and France. 
Our MLST results were used for analyzing correlations among the 
Salmonella  strains.  ERIC-PCR  fingerprinting  has  also  been  used  to 
confirm  epidemiological  relationships  between  various  Salmonella 
isolates (Li, Liu, et al., 2017). In Korea, researchers claimed that ERIC-
PCR combined with virulence profiling offered a rapid approach to 
characterize antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella (Jin & Lee, 2017). We 
did  not  find  a  significant  association  between  ERIC-PCR  clusters, 
source, and other characteristics. However, isolates in the last two 
MLST and ERIC-PCR were similar. In general, MLST and ERIC-PCR 
are useful as phylogenetic tools for investigations outbreaks of this 
pathogen.

5 |  CONCLUSION

Salmonella  enterica  food  poisoning  due  to  egg  consumption  is  a 
longstanding  problem.  Our  study  is  the  first  to  comprehensively 
analyze the prevalence, antibiotic resistance, serotype, and molecu-
lar subtype of strains isolated from Guangdong eggs, which are an 
important  local  food  of  native.  The  results  showed  contamination 
ratio of Salmonella was 5.40%. Antibiotic resistance was widespread, 
especially for β-lactam antibiotics. The isolates belonged to multiple 
serovars. MLST and ERIC-PCR typing showed genetic similarity and 
diversity within those isolates. These results provide useful informa-
tion to improve strategies to control and treat Salmonella infections.
