Currently, antimicrobial resistance is one of the most prominent public health issues.
In fact, there is increasing evidence that animals constitute a reservoir of antimicrobial
resistance. In collaboration with the Lebanese Ministry of Agriculture, the aim of this
study was to determine the prevalence of intestinal carriage of multi-drug-resistant
Gram-negative Bacilli
level. Between August and
December 2015, 981 fecal swabs were obtained from 49 poultry farms distributed
across Lebanon. The swabs were subcultured on MacConkey agar supplemented
with cefotaxime (2 µg/ml). Isolated strains were identiﬁed using MALDI-TOF mass
spectrometry. Multilocus sequence typing analysis was performed for Escherichia coli.
Phenotypic detection of extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) and AmpC production
was performed using double disk synergy and the ampC disk test, respectively.
β-lactamase encoding genes blaCTX−M, blaTEM, blaSHV, blaFOX, blaMOX, blaEBC, blaACC,
blaDHA, and blaCMY using PCR ampliﬁcation. Out of 981 fecal swabs obtained, 203
(20.6%) showed bacterial growth on the selective medium. Of the 235 strains isolated,
217 were identiﬁed as E. coli (92%), eight as Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), three as
Proteus mirabilis (1%) and three as Enterobacter cloacae (1%). MLST analysis of E. coli
isolates showed the presence of ST156, ST5470, ST354, ST155, and ST3224. The
phenotypic tests revealed that 43.5, 28.5, and 20.5% of the strains were ampC, ESBL,
and ampC/ESBL producers, respectively. The putative TEM gene was detected in 83%
of the isolates, SHV in 20%, CTX-M in 53% and CMY ampC β-lactamase gene in 65%.
Our study showed that chicken farms in Lebanon are reservoirs of ESBL and AmpC
producing Gram-negative bacilli. The level of antibiotic consumption in the Lebanese
veterinary medicine should be evaluated. Future studies should focus on the risk factors
associated with the acquisition of multi-drug-resistant organisms in farm animals in
Lebanon.

Antimicrobial Resistant Organisms in Lebanese Poultry

INTRODUCTION

Antibiotic resistance is currently a major topic of interest for
researchers and physicians. In particular, the rise of multi-
drug resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is now a serious
challenge encountered by healthcare professionals (Exner et al.,
2017). Resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is mainly mediated
via the production of extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL),
ampC β-lactamases and carbapenemases (Schill et al., 2017).
Genes encoding these enzymes are often located on plasmids
carrying resistance genes to other commonly used antibiotics in
clinical settings (Seiﬀert et al., 2013). Infections with these multi-
drug-resistant organisms (MDROs) will thus pose therapeutic
challenges; the antibiotic pipeline is drying up, and no new
antimicrobial agents are anticipated in the near future to treat
infections caused by MDROs (Bettiol and Harbarth, 2015).

In fact, it has been generally accepted that the main driver
for the rapid evolution of bacterial resistance is the uncontrolled
usage of antibiotics in human medicine. It is suggested that
this theory is also applicable to the veterinary sector (Kempf
et al., 2015). The European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Control/European Food Safety Authority/European Medicines
Agency (ECDC/EFSA/EMA) joint report stated that in 2014,
the average antibiotic consumption in animals (152 mg/kg)
was higher than in humans (124 mg/kg). Univariate analysis
showed a signiﬁcation correlation between ﬂuoroquinolone
consumption and resistance in Escherichia coli in the human
and animal sectors, between polymyxins and tetracyclines and
E. coli in animals, and for 3rd/4th generation cephalosporins
and E. coli in humans (ECDC/EFSA/EMA, 2017). Antibiotics are
heavily administered for therapeutic and prophylaxis purposes
in veterinary medicine. As growth promoters, this practice
is no longer adapted in the European Union, whereas it
persists in North America and other countries (Economou
and Gousia, 2015). In their study, Chantziaras et al. (2014)
found a signiﬁcant correlation between the use of antibiotics in
livestock and the corresponding level of resistance toward these
antimicrobials in E. coli strains isolated from pigs, poultry and
cattle. During the last years, the prevalence of ESBLs, ampC, and
carbapenemase producing Gram-negative bacteria has become
extensively reported in food producing animals (Ghodousi et al.,
2015; Gonzalez-Torralba et al., 2016; Haenni et al., 2016). In
their review paper, Schwarz et al. (2016) showed that studies
describing the epidemiology of resistant organisms in livestock
targeted mainly swine, cattle and poultry. The prevalence of
resistance varied from one country to another (Alonso et al.,
2017). Although the extent to which food of animal origin
contributes to the zoonotic transmission of multi-drug-resistant
organisms, i.e., ESBL and carbapenemase producers, has not
yet been well established (Madec et al., 2017), it suggests that
sharing the same ESBL genes, plasmids and strains constitutes
possible evidence of zoonotic transmission of MDROs from
animals to humans (Leverstein-van Hall et al., 2011; Dahms et al.,
2014). Furthermore, the increased risk of ESBL fecal carriage in
individuals with a high degree of contact with broiler chickens
is an indicator of transmission (Huijbers et al., 2014). Enteric-
resistant strains in livestock can be easily transferred to humans

through direct contact or through the handling/consumption
of undercooked/uncooked animal products (Dahms et al.,
2014).

In Lebanon, several studies addressing MDROs in hospital
settings have been conducted. One study done at the American
University of Beirut Medical Center between 2008 and 2011
reported that 1.07 and 2.45% of E.
coli and Klebsiella
pneumoniae clinical isolates, respectively, were ESBL producers
and ertapenem-resistant (Baroud et al., 2013). Another study
conducted in the north reported that over the period of
2009–2012, 9% and 28% of
the bacteraemia episodes in
febrile neutropenic patients were caused by carbapenem and
third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli,
respectively (Moghnieh et al., 2015). However, very few
studies have addressed this issue in the environment. One
study showed that Acinetobacter baumannii was detected
in 6.9% of water samples, 2.7% of milk samples, 8.0% of
meat samples, 14.3% of cheese samples and 7.7% of animal
samples (Rafei et al., 2015). Another study in which 115
stool samples were collected from livestock animals from
diﬀerent farms in north Lebanon reported the detection of
four VIM-2 producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, four OXA-
23 producing A. baumannii and one OXA-23/OXA-58 co-
producing A. baumannii (Al Bayssari et al., 2015a). Furthermore,
Al Bayssari et al. (2015b) reported the isolation of an OXA-
48 harboring E. coli
in Lebanon. More
recently, Diab et al. (2016) detected a relatively high prevalence
of CTX-M-15 producing E. coli
in Lebanese cattle. In the
above-mentioned studies in Lebanese livestock, MLST analysis
revealed the presence of sequence types common to both
humans and animals (Al Bayssari et al., 2015a; Rafei et al.,
2015; Diab et al., 2016), which suggests that Lebanese farms
are potent reservoirs of multi-drug-resistant organisms that
could be transmitted to humans. In the present study and in
collaboration with the Lebanese Ministry of Agriculture, our
aim was to determine the national epidemiology of multi-drug-
resistant Gram-negative bacilli in Lebanese chicken farms in
terms of intestinal carriage.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Ethics Statement
The Ministry of Agriculture in Lebanon granted approval
to collect chicken samples from representative farms in the
country as per the national norms for animal sampling and
manipulation. This sampling was in conformity with the
international regulations for animal safety. All of the involved
farms oﬃcially received authorization from the Ministry of
Agriculture, and this was considered, after undergoing an
acceptance process, an oﬃcial and legal document. Therefore, an
Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was obtained for the
present study.

Samples Collection
Between August and December 2015, 981 rectal swabs were
collected from 49 poultry farms distributed over the seven

districts of Lebanon. Six to seven farms were visited in each
district. The average number of samples taken from each farm
was 20 fecal swabs (Table 1). The 20 samples collected were
randomly taken from each farm. Technical assistance,
i.e.,
fecal swabs, gloves, costumes, and a portable refrigerator, were
provided by the Ministry of Agriculture team. The collected
swabs were directly placed in a portable refrigerator, and when
they arrived at the University Laboratory, they were stored at
−80◦C until use. The farms visited were selected by considering
their geographical location, presence or absence of a nearby
community and the size of the farms (at least 3,000 chickens per
breeding site). Eighty percent of the samples were gathered from
broiler chickens, while 20% were taken from layers. The mean
average age of the broilers and layers was 31 days and 14 months,
respectively.

the Microﬂex LT spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen,
Germany) (Seng et al., 2010; Singhal et al., 2015). The spectra
obtained for each strain were stored and downloaded into a
MALDI Biotyper 3.0 system to create a single main spectrum for
each bacterial isolate. Thereafter, a dendrogram was constructed
using MALDI Biotyper 3.0 software.

Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing
Using the Kirby–Bauer disk diﬀusion method, antibiotic
susceptibility testing was performed. The results were interpreted
according to EUCAST guidelines 2017 (European Committee on
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing, 2017). Sixteen antimicrobial
agents were used including ampicillin, aztreonam, cefotaxime,
ceftazidime, cefoxitin, cefepime, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid,
piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem,
imipenem, ertapenem,
colistin, tigecycline, ciproﬂoxacin, gentamicin and trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole
France).
Phenotypic detection of ESBL was performed using the double-
disk synergy test by placing an amoxicillin–clavulanic acid disk
in the center between aztreonam, cefepime and ceftazidime. The
observation of a “key hole eﬀect” was considered a positive test.
On the other hand, ampC β-lactamase detection was performed
using the ampC disk test (Black et al., 2005). In brief, a lawn
of cefoxitin-susceptible E. coli ATCC 25922 was inoculated on
the surface of a Mueller Hinton agar plate. A 30-µg cefoxitin
disk was placed on the inoculated surface. A sterile ﬁlter paper
disk was moistened by adding 20 µl of a 1:1 mixture of saline
and 100 × Tris-EDTA (catalog code T-9285; Sigma-Aldrich
Corporation, St. Louis, MO, United States). Several colonies
of the test isolate were then applied to the disk. The disk was
then positioned with its inoculated face in contact with the agar
surface. After overnight incubation, a ﬂattening or indentation of
the zone of inhibition around the cefoxitin disk was considered
a positive result, while an absence of distortion was considered

a negative one. Furthermore, for the presumptive detection of
carbapenemases, the carba NP test was performed as previously
described (Bakour et al., 2015). A bacterium was characterized
as being multi-drug-resistant when resistance to at least three
classes of antibiotics was observed (Magiorakos et al., 2012).

Molecular Characterization of
β-Lactamase Encoding Genes
All of the isolates that showed a key hole eﬀect or had cefoxitin
resistance with non-susceptibility to cefepime were subjected
to real-time PCR analysis for the detection of SHV, TEM and
CTX-M encoding genes (Roschanski et al., 2014). Simplex PCRs
for the genes encoding AmpC β-lactamases FOX, MOX, ACC,
EBC, DHA, and CMY were conducted for all strains showing
non-susceptibility to cefoxitin (Dallenne et al., 2010). Simplex
PCR was also used to test the ADC ampC β-lactamase gene
in A. baumannii (Liu and Liu, 2015). DNA extraction was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions using
EZ1 DNA extraction kits (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) with the
EZ1 Advanced XL biorobot.

Multilocus Sequence Typing
One E. coli strain from each cluster shown in the MSP
dendrogram was chosen, and MLST typing was performed based
on allelic proﬁles to determine their evolutionary relationship
(Peng and Zong, 2011). Seven housekeeping genes were used:
adk, fumC, gyrB, icd, mdh, purA, and recA. Analysis of the genes’
allelic proﬁles was performed on the MLST1 to determine the
sequence type (ST) to which each isolate belongs.

Statistical Analysis
The prevalence, identiﬁcation, and resistance proﬁles of isolated
strains are all presented as the number (percentage).

RESULTS

Bacterial Identiﬁcation
Out of 982 collected fecal swabs, 203 (20.6%) showed growth
on selective medium. In total, 235 strains were isolated. All 235
isolated Gram-negative bacilli were identiﬁed by MALDI TOF
mass spectrometry with a score value ≥1.9. The distribution at
the species level was as follows: 217 were identiﬁed as E. coli
(92%), eight as K. pneumoniae (3%), three as Proteus mirabilis
(1%), three as Enterobacter cloacae (1%), two as E. albertii, one
as E. fergusonii and one as A. baumannii. The MSP dendrogram
of the 217 E. coli isolates revealed ﬁve clusters at a distance level
of 500 (arbitrarily selected) (Figure 1). Cluster 1 was mainly
formed by isolates from the Akkar District. Cluster 2 contained
two isolates: one from Saida and the other from Baalbek. Cluster
3 was composed of three strains isolated from Jabal Lebnen
District. Cluster 4 was mainly composed of isolates from the
North Lebanon district, and Cluster 5 contained only one strain
from Saida.

Phenotypic Proﬁles of Resistance
The disk diﬀusion susceptibility testing results are summarized
in Table 2. All of the isolates were susceptible to tigecycline,
colistin and carbapenems. Phenotypic identiﬁcation using the
double disk synergy test, ampC disk test and carba NP test
revealed that 102 (43.5%) of the isolated strains were ampC β-
lactamase producers, 67 (28.5%) were ESBL producers, and 48
(20.5%) were co-producers of ESBL and ampC β-lactamases.
Both ESBL and ESBL/ampC production were detected in E. coli,
K. pneumoniae, E. fergusonii, and E. cloacae (Table 2), whereas
only AmpC production was detected in E. coli, K. pneumoniae,
P. mirabilis, E. albertii, and A. baumannii. In addition, 18
E. coli strains (7.5%) did not show a key hole eﬀect and were

resistant to cefoxitin but tested negative with the ampC disk
test. Moreover, 32% of the isolated strains were co-resistant to
gentamicin, ciproﬂoxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,
whereas 40% were resistant
two non-β-lactam
antibiotics, 19.5% were resistant to only one non-β-lactam,
and 8% were susceptible to all of the non-β-lactam antibiotics
tested.

Figure 2, the highest prevalence was detected in the north-
west of the country, with 74 and 44 isolated strains for the
North and Akkar Districts, respectively, whereas the lowest
prevalence was detected in the north–east and south–east of
Lebanon.

MLST Typing
The MLST typing of the strains, each chosen from the major
district-related isolates grouped in each cluster, revealed that they
belong to ﬁve diﬀerent STs: ST156 for Cluster 1, ST5470 for
Cluster 2, ST354 for Cluster 3, ST155 for Cluster 4 and ST3224
for Cluster 5.

DISCUSSION

PCR Screening of CTX-M, SHV, TEM, and
AmpC β-Lactamase Genes
One hundred and twelve isolates suspected to be ESBL producers
were subjected to a real-time PCR assay for the detection of
SHV, TEM, and CTX-M encoding genes. Of the 112 strains
selected, 93 (83%) harbored the TEM gene, 59 (53%) the
CTX-M gene and 22 (20%) the SHV gene. Overall, 49% (55)
of the ESBL suspected isolates harbored only one gene, 46%
(52) harbored at least two genes with the highest concordance
being between the TEM and CTX-M genes, and 4% (ﬁve)
showed the co-existence of all three genes together (Table 3). In
parallel, 152 strains including 4 K. pneumoniae, 3 P. mirabilis,
2 E. albertii, and 143 E. coli were positive for blaCMY; whereas
ﬁfteen E. coli strains were negative fall ampC β-lactamase
genes tested. Furthermore, in A. baumannii the ADC gene was
detected.

Many years ago, hospitals and health care settings were regarded
as the sole source of antimicrobial resistance. However, recent
evidence has shown that food producing animals constitute a
potent reservoir of multi-drug-resistant organisms (Belmahdi
et al., 2016; Bachiri et al., 2017). This was mainly linked to
the over-use of antimicrobial agents in veterinary medicine for
treatment, growth promotion and prophylaxis (Economou and
Gousia, 2015). Although the zoonotic transmission of multi-
drug-resistant organisms from animals to humans remains
controversial (Olsen et al., 2014), several studies have shown
a direct link between direct contact with farm animals and
the acquisition of bacterial resistance (Huijbers et al., 2014).
One study conducted by Olaitan et al. (2015) demonstrated the
zoonotic transmission of a colistin-resistant E. coli strain from a
pig to its owner. This owner usually fed his pig without wearing
any protective equipment. The two colistin-resistant isolates (in
the pig and its owner) belonged to the same sequence type and

presented with the same virulence and PFGE pattern (Olaitan
et al., 2015).

In Lebanon, very few studies have looked at the prevalence
of MDROs in farm animals (Al Bayssari et al., 2015a). Our
study is the ﬁrst epidemiological study in Lebanon quantifying
the prevalence of multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli in
chicken farms in terms of intestinal carriage at the national level.
The prevalence is similar to the one previously reported from
cattle (84%) in Lebanon (Diab et al., 2016). The ﬂock’s size did not
inﬂuence the prevalence of resistance in each farm (Table 1). On
a global level, the prevalence found in our study is approximate
to the one reported in Romania (69%) (Maciuca et al., 2015) and
Ecuador (60%) (Ortega-Paredes et al., 2016) but is higher than
the ones described in Germany (44%) (Kola et al., 2012), Japan
(23%) (Kawamura et al., 2014), and Vietnam (3.2%) (Nguyen
et al., 2015). Diﬀerences in the screening methodologies, sample
size used and the level of antibiotic consumption in each country
could explain these variations (Rhouma et al., 2016).

Escherichia coli was the most common multi-drug-resistant
organism isolated; MALDI-TOF MSP dendrogram and MLST
analysis revealed the presence of ﬁve clusters from which the
representative strains belonged to diﬀerent STs. Within each
cluster, strains isolated from farms of the same district were
grouped together; this is especially true for the Akkar and
North Lebanon strains. This observation reveals that strains
of the same region are closely related. Although PFGE is the
standard method for the detection of clones, due to the large
number of strains isolated in this study, PFGE typing was not
performed; rather, we referred to the MSP dendrogram as a
possible rapid tool for strain diﬀerentiation according to their
geographical and/or phenotypic distribution in epidemiological
studies as certain previous studies have suggested (Berrazeg et al.,
2013; Khennouchi et al., 2015). With the exception of ST155,
none of the sequence types identiﬁed in this study were among
those frequently reported in chicken such as ST10, ST23, ST48,
ST58, ST115, ST117, ST350, and ST648 (Olsen et al., 2014).
However, looking at the Warwick E. coli MLST database, we
found that the STs detected in our study were previously reported
from livestock, cats and dogs, and humans. ST155 has been
commonly reported in poultry (Pires-dos-Santos et al., 2013), and
it appears to be associated with a zoonotic risk, which has been
suggested by some studies (Lazarus et al., 2015). This emphasizes
the hypothesis that MDROs in food-producing animals can be
transmitted to humans and may be causative agents of infections
with therapeutic challenges when high resistance is encountered.
It should also be mentioned that clones in animals and humans
are not always shared; some studies have shown that E. coli
strains in food-producing animals diﬀer from those reported in
humans (Randall et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2013). This suggests that
only some bacterial clones might be transmitted to the human
population.

As our study showed, ESBL producers dominate the Lebanese
poultry sector. The prevalence of ampC producers is also elevated
(43.5%). ESBL and ampC-producing Gram-negative bacilli were
previously reported in clinical and community settings in
Lebanon (Dandachi et al., 2016). Molecular characterization
revealed that 50% of isolated strains co-harbored at least two

β-lactamase genes with the most common being CTX-M and
TEM. Moreover, the only AmpC β-lactamase encoding gene was
the CMY ampC β-lactamase. This gene was previously reported
in poultry (Dierikx et al., 2013; El-Shazly et al., 2017) as well
as in food producing animals (Sato et al., 2014; Aguilar-Montes
de Oca et al., 2015) and healthy pets (Donati et al., 2014; Liu
et al., 2016). As per the phenotypic and genotypic detection of

AmpC production, these showed that there are some strains
that were negative with the ampC disk test but positive for
an ampC β-lactamase gene and vice-versa. Phenotypically false
negatives shows the importance of the molecular testing in the
detection of AmpC production. On the other hand, in the 15
E. coli strains that were negative for plasmidic ampC β-lactamase
genes; one explanation for this might be due to an overexpression

the chromosomal ampC gene mediated by a mutation
of
in the promoter/attenuator region as described in previous
studies (Escudero et al., 2010; Haenni et al., 2014). Regarding
non-β-lactam co-resistance in ESBL and/or ampC producers,
antimicrobial resistance toward gentamicin was relatively high
in this study. In fact, 66% of ESBL and/or ampC producing
Gram-negative bacilli were gentamicin resistant. This could
possibly be linked to the frequent use of this antibiotic in
Lebanese farms as several studies have reported (El-Rami et al.,
2012; Diab et al., 2016). One study conducted by Abdelnoor
et al. (2013) found a signiﬁcant association between gentamicin
resistance in E. coli isolates and the use of this antimicrobial
agent as a food additive in poultry in Lebanon. Another study
launched a questionnaire-based survey on the most common
antibiotics used in Lebanese livestock and found that gentamicin
and streptomycin are the most common and heavily used
antimicrobial agents (Kassaify et al., 2013). Another thing to
mention is that in this study, no carbapenemase producers
were detected. There might be two possible explanations for
this: the ﬁrst one is that carbapenemase producers are really
scarce in Lebanese chicken farms; the second one is that these
isolates were missed due to the medium used for the screening
of multi-drug-resistant organisms. As has been reported, OXA-
48 carbapenemase producers are frequently found in hospitals
and nursing homes and in fowls in Lebanon (Al Bayssari
et al., 2015b). OXA-48 carbapenemases do not always confer
resistance to third-generation cephalosporins unless there is
another mechanism of resistance that co-exists in the same
bacterial cell
(Poirel et al., 2012). Therefore, Oxacillinase
producers could have been missed or under-estimated in our
study.

Our study has two main limitations. The ﬁrst one is that the
primers used for blaTEM and blaSHV screening were universal,
and thus, the possibility of having non-ESBL variants cannot
be ruled out. However, as the strains presented with a typical
ESBL phenotype,
i.e., the key hole eﬀect and resistance to
penicillin, monobactams and third-generation cephalosporins
with susceptibility to carbapenems, the TEM-positive strains
were considered as ESBL producers and were included in the
description of the MDR-GNB prevalence in this study. The
second limitation is the low number of isolates subjected to MLST
typing. MLST and PFGE analysis remain the gold standard for
clone/cluster detection in epidemiological studies regardless of

the number of strains (McGregor and Spratt, 2005; Zou et al.,
2010).

CONCLUSION

Our study illustrates the current epidemiology of multi-drug-
resistant Gram-negative bacilli in Lebanese chicken farms. ESBL
and ampC producers cross-resistant to antibiotics used in human
medicine are highly prevalent across the territory. Our study
suggests that poultry farms are potent reservoirs of antimicrobial
resistance in Lebanon. Although very few studies have reported
the detection of carbapenemase producers in Lebanese Livestock
(Al Bayssari et al., 2015a,b), it will likely only be a matter of time
before these organisms become prevalent in Lebanese animal
farms. This is especially true if no strict rules are implemented
to control the overuse and misuse of antibiotics for treatment,
growth promotion and prophylaxis in Lebanese agriculture. We
believe that the prescription of antibiotics often used in human
medicine should be reduced or even banned in the veterinary
sector.
