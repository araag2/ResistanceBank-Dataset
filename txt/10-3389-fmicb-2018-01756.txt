Objectives: The aim of the present study was to explore the prevalence and molecular
characterization of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli
collected from pig farms in Northwest China.

Methods: Between May 2015 and June 2017, a total of 456 E. coli
isolates were
collected from fecal samples of healthy and diarrheal pigs in Northwest China to screen
the ESBL producers. The β-lactamases, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR)
genes and virulence genes among ESBL producers were corroborated by PCR and
sequencing. Finally, ESBL producers were further grouped according to phylogenetic
background and genetic relatedness.

forty, thirty, seven, four, two and one isolates, respectively. Sequencing revealed the most
common blaCTX−M subtype was blaCTX−M−14 (n = 24), followed by blaCTX−M−15 (n = 14),
blaCTX−M−64 (n = 11), blaCTX−M−9 (n = 10) and blaCTX−M−123 (n = 9). qnrS (n = 23) was
the predominant PMQR gene, and all PMQR genes were detected in co-existence with
β-lactamase genes. estA (n = 18) and F4 (n = 18) were the most prevalent enterotoxin
and ﬁmbrial adhesin, respectively, and 27 different virotypes were found with respect to
the association of enterotoxins and ﬁmbrial adhesins. Twenty-four different sequence
types (STs) were identiﬁed among 44 ESBL producers, and clones ST405, ST10 and
ST648 were strongly present in more than one-third (34.1%) of ESBL producers.

The E. coli From Swine in Northwest China

Conclusion: All ESBL-producing E. coli isolates exhibited MDR phenotype, and showed
high prevalence of β-lactamase and PMQR genes. Especially, one isolate harbored ESBL
genes blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX−M−9, blaCTX−M−14, blaCTX−M−64, and carbapenemase
gene blaOXA−48 and blaKPC−2, as well as PMQR genes qnrS, qnrB, qnrD, qepA and
aac(6’)-Ib-cr.

Keywords: Escherichia coli, antibiotic resistance, β-lactamase, OXA-48, PMQR

INTRODUCTION

Escherichia coli (E. coli) is both a ubiquitous commensal
bacterium in intestinal tract and an important pathogen of
diarrhea or extraintestinal infections of humans and animals,
and both commensal and pathogenic isolates usually share
(Wu et al., 2013). Cephalosporins
the same environment
are eﬀective for gram-negative bacterial infections, especially
for infections caused by multidrug resistant (MDR) E. coli
(Silva-Sanchez et al., 2013). At present, extended-spectrum
β-lactams are not the ﬁrst-line treatment in food animals,
whereas the resistance to β-lactams, especially to the third-
and fourth-generation cephalosporins has increased markedly
accompanying their massive or inappropriate use over the
past decades, and it is also considered as an important public
health challenge (Agersø and Aarestrup, 2013). Nowadays, one
of the most worrisome resistance mechanisms to β-lactams
is the emergence of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs),
which could inactivate oxyimino-β-lactams like third-generation
cephalosporins and aztreonam (Liu et al., 2015). Moreover,
ESBLs are generally located on the transmissible plasmids,
and could be acquired between bacteria by conjugation
mechanism (Cantas et al., 2015). A recent study has further
suggested that ESBL-producing E. coli isolate, along with their
antibiotic resistance genes, can spread from food animals
and animals-derived foods to humans via food-chain (Geser
et al., 2012). Additionally, plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamase
blaCMY−2, carbapenemases blaNDM−1, blaOXA−48 and blaKPC−2
are also increasingly described (Conceição-Neto et al., 2017;
Subirats et al., 2017). As a result,
the dissemination of
ESBL-producing isolates poses a serious risk to both animal
and human health. Furthermore, ESBL producers have been
associated with resistance to non-β-lactam antimicrobials, such
as ﬂuoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and sulfonamides, which
are often used long term to treat and prevent diseases on pig
farms in China (Tian et al., 2009, 2012; Yuan et al., 2009).
Especially, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR)
genes are thought to be linked with ESBL production, and spread
of E. coli co-expressing PMQRs and ESBLs could contribute to
growing concerns about resistant E. coli isolates (Wang et al.,
2012).

The prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli isolates in food
animals has been increasing worldwide, and they pose a
serious challenge in controlling bacterial diarrhea in swine
industry. However, very little data have been reported on the
occurrence and various types of β-lactamases among E. coli
from swine in Northwest China. The main purpose of this

study was to screen ESBL-producing E. coli isolates collected
from pig farms in Northwest China, and further analyze ESBL
producers based on genetic relatedness, virulence proﬁles, and
the occurrence and transferability of β-lactamase and PMQR
genes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample Collection and Bacterial Culture
During May 2015 to June 2017, 456 E. coli
isolates (270
from healthy pigs, 186 from diarrheal pigs) were isolated from
fecal samples of diﬀerent swine in ten pig farms, which are
widely dispersed across Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. Fecal
samples were collected from individual pigs using a sterile cotton
swab and transported to laboratory within 12 h. All samples
were immediately seeded on MacConkey agar (Beijing Land
Bridge Technology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China). After incubation
at 37◦C for 18 to 24 h, three colonies with typical E. coli
morphology (bright pink with a dimple) were randomly selected
and transferred to Eosin Methylene Blue agar (Qingdao Hope
Bio Technology Co., Ltd, Qingdao, Shandong, China) for
further puriﬁcation. Finally, the suspect E. coli isolates on Eosin
Methylene Blue agar (green colonies with a metallic sheen)
were subjected to biochemical tests (indole, methyl red, oxidase,
citrate, and triple sugar iron) as described previously (Liu et al.,
2017). All conﬁrmed E. coli isolates were stored at −80◦C in
Tryptic Soy broth medium containing 30% glycerol for later
study.

The E. coli From Swine in Northwest China

Phylogenetic Grouping and Virulence
Genotyping
DNA from each ESBL producer was extracted using boiling
method, and the distribution of phylogenetic groups of ESBL
producers were determined by quadruplex PCR as described by
Clermont et al. (Clermont et al., 2013). Meanwhile, enterotoxins
(elt, estA, estB, stx1, stx2, and astA) and ﬁmbrial adhesins (F4, F5,
F6, F17, F18 and F41) as well as intimin encoded by eae gene
were detected using single or multiplex PCR with speciﬁc primers
as previously described (Boerlin et al., 2005; Toledo et al.,
2012). The E. coli strains used as positive controls were B2 (eae,
stx1, stx2), 256 (estA, estB), 281 (elt), G2077 (F4), B21523 (F5),
J7203349 (F6), 320 (F41), and B37429 (F18), and E. coli K12
C600 was used as a negative control. Part of control strains
were kindly supplied by Dr. Boothe (Auburn University, USA).
The primer sequences used for PCR detection are listed in
Table S1.

Identiﬁcation of β-Lactamase Genes and
Plasmid-Mediated Quinolone Resistance
Genes
The occurrence of β-lactamase
(blaTEM, blaSHV,
blaCTX−Ms), plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamase (blaCMY−2)
and carbapenemase genes (blaKPC−2, blaNDM−1, and blaOXA−48)
among ESBL producers were determined by PCR and sequencing
using speciﬁc primers (Table S2). The PCR products were
puriﬁed using a PCR Puriﬁcation Kit
(TianGen, Beijing,
China), and then the ampliﬁed products were sequenced by
Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China). DNA Sequences were
compared with known sequences available from the BLAST
program
(https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)(Altschul
et al., 1997). Additionally, all ESBL producers were screened
for the presence of PMQR genes (qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrD,
qnrS, aac(6’)-Ib-cr, oqxAB, and qepA) as described previously
(Liu et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2015). E. coli J53 strains containing
pMG252, pMG298, pMG306, and pMG298 were used as
positive controls for qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, and aac(6′)-Ib-cr genes,
respectively. E.
J7261205 (pSTVqepA) and S5314175
were included as positive controls for qepA and oqxAB,
respectively. The positive control strain for qnrC was not
available.

Conjugation Experiments
In order to analyze the horizontal transferability of β-lactamase
and PMQR genes, especially blaOXA−48 gene, conjugation
experiments were performed with eight ESBL-producing E. coli
isolates, including four blaOXA−48 positive isolates, from diﬀerent
pig farms in seven diﬀerent regions. Conjugation experiments
were conducted by broth mating method using E. coli J53 AZr as a
recipient (Shaheen et al., 2011). Transconjugants were selected on
Tryptic Soy agar plates containing sodium azide (150 µg/ml) and
cefotaxime (2 µg/ml). All transconjugants, recipient and donors
were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. PCR and
sequencing were performed to verify the transferability of PMQR
and β-lactamase genes.

Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST)
MLST of ESBL-producing E. coli isolates was performed as
described previously (Wirth et al., 2006). A detailed scheme of
gene ampliﬁcation, allelic type and sequence type assignment
methods is available on the MLST website (http://mlst.warwick.
ac.uk/mlst/dbs/Ecoli).

Statistical Analysis
Signiﬁcance was determined by Pearson’s Chi-squared test with
Yates continuity correction using “R” software (version 3.0.1),
and the level of signiﬁcance was set at P < 0.05.

RESULTS

Antimicrobial Susceptibility of E. coli
Isolates
The results of antibiotic resistance proﬁles of 456 E. coli
isolates are listed in Table 1, 96.1% of the E. coli isolates were
resistant to ampicillin, followed by amoxicillin-clavulanic acid
(91.2%), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (82%), oxytetracycline
(74.3%), enroﬂoxacin (70%), gentamicin (61.4%), ﬂorfenicol
(58.8%), ciproﬂoxacin (57.9%), and amikacin (52.2%). The
percentage of resistance to other antibacterial agents were
lower than 50%. It
is noteworthy that signiﬁcantly more
E. coli isolates from diarrheal pigs than those from healthy
pigs were resistant to most antimicrobials tested (P < 0.001)
with the exception of ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim
and colistin (Table 1). Of 456 E. coli
isolates investigated,
44 isolates (9.6%, six isolates from healthy pigs and 38
from diarrhea pigs) were conﬁrmed as phenotypic ESBL
producers, and exhibited MDR phenotype. 97.7% of
the
ESBL producers were resistant
followed by
oxytetracycline (93.2%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (93.2%),
enroﬂoxacin (93.2%), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (90.9%),
ceftazidime (86.4%), cefotaxime (84.1%) and gentamicin
(81.8%).

Phylogenetic Typing and Virulence
Genotyping
Phylogenetic group analysis for 44 ESBL producers revealed
that the predominant phylogenetic group was D (14/44, 31.8%),
followed by phylogenetic groups B2 (11/44, 25%), A (9/44,
20.5%), B1 (6/44, 13.6%), C (3/44, 6.8%), and E (1/44, 2.3%)
(Table 2). Groups D and B2 accounted for 56.8% of the ESBL
producers. The frequencies of major virulence genes are listed
in Table 2. 93.2% of the ESBL producers possessed at least one
virulence gene. estA (n = 18) was the most prevalent toxin gene,
followed by estB (n = 15), astA (n = 12), and elt (n = 10) genes.
The most prevalent ﬁmbrial adhesin was F4 (n = 18), followed
by F18 (n = 10), F17 (n = 4), F5 (n = 3), F6 (n = 3) and
F41 (n = 2). Furthermore, 86.4% (38/44) of the ESBL producers
carried both enterotoxins and ﬁmbrial adhesins, and 27 diﬀerent
virotypes were identiﬁed according to the combinations of
enterotoxin and adhesin genes. The eae gene was detected
in two ESBL producers (4.5%), while stx1 and stx2 were not
detected.

The E. coli From Swine in Northwest China

Characterization of ESBL and PMQR
Genes
Each ESBL producer harbored at
least one β-lactamase
gene. blaCTX−M, blaTEM, blaSHV, blaOXA−48, blaKPC−2, and
blaNDM−1were detected in forty (90.9%), thirty (68.2%), seven
(15.9%),
four (9.1%), two (4.5%), and one (2.3%) isolates,
respectively (Table 2). AmpC β-lactamase gene blaCMY−2 was not
detected. Overall, blaCTX−M−14 (n = 24) was the predominant
genotype in blaCTX−M positive isolates, followed by blaCTX−M−15
(n = 14), blaCTX−M−64 (n = 11), blaCTX−M−9 (n = 10)
and blaCTX−M−123
(n = 9), while blaCTX−M−1 gene was
not detected. The distribution of PMQR genes among 44
isolates is shown in Table 2. 88.6%
ESBL-producing E. coli
(39/44) of ESBL producers were found to harbor at
least
one PMQR gene, and seven types of PMQR were identiﬁed.
qnrS, qnrA, aac(6’)-Ib-cr, qnrB, oqxAB, qnrD, and qepA were
detected alone or incombination in 52.3% (24/44), 34.1%
(15/44), 27.3% (12/44), 20.5% (9/44), 6.8% (3/44), 4.5% (2/44),
and 4.5% (2/44) of ESBL-producing isolates, respectively.
qnrS was the most common PMQR gene, and qnrS+qnrA
was the most common combination (n = 6). No isolates
were positive for qnrC gene. Among 39 PMQR positive
isolates, 28 (80%) isolates were positive for more than one
PMQR determinant. Furthermore, all PMQR genes were
detected in co-existence with β-lactamases, and one isolate
from the intestinal content of a 15-day-old dead piglet with
serious diarrhea harbored β-lactamase genes blaTEM, blaSHV,
blaCTX−M−9, blaCTX−M−14, blaCTX−M−64 and carbapenemase
gene blaOXA−48 and blaKPC−2, as well as PMQR genes qnrS,
qnrB, qnrD, qepA, and aac(6’)-Ib-cr. blaOXA−48 gene was detected
in four meropenem-non-susceptible or meropenem-resistant
isolates.

Conjugation Experiments
Five out of eight ESBL producers successfully transferred the
β-lactamase genes to recipient strain E. coli J53 AZr. PCR
analysis showed that the presence of respective β-lactamase
genes,
including one blaOXA−48-carrying plasmids from all
transconjugants. Accordingly, PMQR genes qnr and aac-(6′)-
Ib-cr were co-transferred with β-lactamase genes (Table 3).
Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns showed that all donors and
their transconjugants were resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic
acid, ampicillin, ceftiofur, cefotaxime, and all transconjugants
exhibited an increase of at least 8-fold in MICs compared to
the recipient, E. coli J53 AZr. The enroﬂoxacin MICs for four
transconjugants harboring aac-(6′)-Ib-cr ranged from 0.125 to
0.5 mg/L, representing an increase of 4-fold to 8-fold compared
with the recipient (Table 3). Additionally, the transconjugants
remained susceptible to meropenem, enroﬂoxacin, ﬂorfenicol,
oxytetracycline,
sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim
and colistin, whereas one blaOXA−48 positive transconjugant
reduced meropenem susceptibility.

MLST Proﬁles
Forty-four ESBL producers belonged to 24 sequence types (STs)
(Table 2). The most prevalent was ST405 (n = 6), followed
by ST10 (n = 5). ST405 (n = 6), ST648 (n = 4) and ST38

Liu et al.

The E. coli From Swine in Northwest China

(n = 3) of phylogenetic group D accounted for 29.5% of the
ESBL producers. The carbapenemases blaOXA−48, blaNDM−1 and
blaKPC−2 were connected with sequence types ST405, ST131 and
ST38. The isolates with same STs have similar virotypes and
β-lactamase proﬁles.

DISCUSSION

The prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli isolates in food animals
has been increasing worldwide (Liebana et al., 2013). In China,
diarrhea caused by pathogenic E. coli, especially ESBL-producing
E. coli poses a serious threat to the swine industry and public
health (Lei et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2015). The present study is
the ﬁrst contribution to explore the detailed characterizations of
ESBL-producing E. coli isolates from pigs in Northwest China.
Forty-four (9.6%) isolates were conﬁrmed as ESBL producers,
while it is noteworthy that 456 E. coli in this study isolated from
feces of healthy and diarrheal pigs, and the prevalence of ESBL
producer were signiﬁcantly higher among isolates from diarrheal
pigs than that form healthy isolates (20.4vs. 2.2%; P < 0.001).
The detectable rate of ESBL producer in diarrheal pigs was
similar with the result in Sichuan (26.8%), a neighbor province
of Shaanxi, while it was signiﬁcantly lower than in Heilongjiang
(43.2%), a province in the northeast China (Tian et al., 2009; Xu
et al., 2015). Moreover, our results showed that ESBL producers
mainly belonged to phylogenetic groups D and B2, and to a
lesser extent to phylogenetic A, while the previous studies showed
that E. coli from pigs or duck in China also mainly fell into
phylogenetic groups A (Wang et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2012).
It is further conﬁrmed that the emergence of ESBL-producing
E. coli has a geographic variation with respect to demographic,
environmental, behavioral, socioeconomic and infectious risk
factors with the extending of ESBL-producing isolates stage by
stage.

All 456 E. coli isolates in this study were tested for their
susceptibility to 15 antimicrobial agents. Overall, the number of
resistant isolates in ESBL producers and isolates from diarrheal
pigs were higher than that from healthy pigs (P > 0.001). It
is suggested that the isolates from diarrheal pigs may be more
likely to develop antibiotic resistance than that from healthy
pigs because of the frequent use of antimicrobials in preventing
and treating diarrhea. All ESBL producers were resistant to
at least ﬁve antimicrobial agents, and vast majority of them
(>93%) remained susceptible to meropenem and colistin, which
are considered the eﬀective candidates for treatment of serious
infections caused by E. coli in pig farms of China. According to
the virotypes, 86.4% of ESBL producers carried both enterotoxins
and ﬁmbrial adhesins. It is indicated that these isolates should
be enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), which are responsible for
neonatal diarrhea and postweaning diarrhea in piglets. F4
ﬁmbrial adhesin was present 40.9% of the ESBL producers, it
is consistent with the previous studies that F4 adhesin gene is
one of the most frequently found genes in E. coli isolates from
suckling and weaning piglets (Vu Khac et al., 2006; Zhang et al.,
2007). Furthermore, the gene combinations of F4+estA/estB were
present in 34.1% of the isolates.

Since the early 2000s, CTX-M-type ESBLs have been
increasingly reported, and they have now replaced TEM and
SHV as the most common type of ESBL (Barguigua et al.,
2011). The most predominant ESBL gene in this study was
blaCTX−M (90.9%), and the similar ﬁndings showed that CTX-
Ms accounted for 87.1% of ESBL-producing E. coli isolated
from food animals based on a previous survey in China (Rao
et al., 2014). blaCTX−M−14 remained the most common genotype,
and followed by blaCTX−M−15. It is surprising that no isolate
contained blaCTX−M−1, whereas it was detected in the ESBL-
producing E. coli from dogs, retail pork and water bodies
in Shaanxi province (Xi et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2016b). In
regards to the linkage of phylogenetic group and β-lactamases,
isolates of group D harbored more β-lactamases genes, and
isolates of group A harbored less β-lactamases. Novel hybrid β-
lactamase gene blaCTX−M−123 was ﬁrstly discovered in E. coli
from pig feces in China in 2013 (He et al., 2013), and it was
detected in nine ESBL producers in this study. Moreover, four
ESBL producers were commensal isolates from healthy pigs,
it was further indicated that some commensal organisms in
animals have acquired β-lactamase genes with the increasing
use of β-lactams in animals. blaOXA−48 was detected in four
ESBL producers from diarrheal pigs. As a globally emerging
carbapenemase gene, blaOXA−48 could hydrolyze carbapenems
and β-lactamase inhibitors but has no activity toward broad-
spectrum cephalosporins (Mathers et al., 2013). blaOXA−48 was
ﬁrstly discovered in E. coli from dogs in Germany in 2013, and
afterward it was reported in E. coli from companion animals in
the United States in 2016 (Stolle et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2016a).
In 2017, it was reported in pigs in Italy (Pulss et al., 2017). Most
recently, it was detected in Enterobacteriaceae from river water
in Algeria (Tafoukt et al., 2017). Considering the importance
of blaOXA−48 gene in public health, it is necessary to further
investigate the dissemination of blaOXA−48 producing E. coli
isolates among diﬀerent sources.

PMQR genes were often found to be strongly associated with
β-lactamase genes and even in the same plasmid, and they are
not merely able to confer resistance against quinolones but also
often related to ESBLs (Jeong et al., 2011). In this study, PMQR
genes were present in 88.6% of ESBL producers, and the similar
ﬁndings have been reported in ESBL-producing E. coli isolates
form pigs in previous studies in China by Xu et al. (87.4%)
and Liu et al (83.8%) (Liu et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2015). Thirty-
seven ESBL producers (84.1%) harbored at least one qnr gene,
and qnrS was the predominant, whereas a low prevalence of
qnr genes was detected among ESBL-producing E. coli isolates
in France and Canada (1.6 and 1%, respectively). In addition,
qepA gene was detected in combination with other PMQR
and β-lactamase genes in four isolates (10%). The frequent
combination of β-lactamases and PMQRs in this study further
supported the previous studies that coproduction of β-lactamase
and PMQR genes could contribute to the dissemination of
MDR isolates, and also reﬂect the fact that genes encoding
resistance to β-lactams and quinolones are located on the same
plasmid.

Twenty-four diﬀerent sequence types were identiﬁed, and
three sequence types (ST405, ST10, and ST648) accounted for

The E. coli From Swine in Northwest China

34.1% of the ESBL producers. Sequence types ST10, ST38,
ST131, ST648, and ST405 clones were documented in diﬀerent
sources according to MLST databases, and could favor the
dissemination of CTX-M worldwide among E. coli
isolates
(Hernandez and Gonzalez-Acuna, 2016). In the present study, a
few isolates belonging to diﬀerent STs shared similar β-lactamase
and PMQR gene proﬁles, whereas several isolates belonging to
same ST exhibited diﬀerent gene proﬁles. The similar results
were observed among E. coli isolates from dogs and cats in
previous studies (Liu et al., 2016a,b). The possible explanation
is that the pig trade, personnel exchanges and water sources
among adjacent regions may lead to the dissemination of isolates
with same gene proﬁles or same ST types. Anyway, deeper
analyses for such isolates are necessary in the future. It is
noteworthy that blaOXA−48 gene were detected in four isolates
with reduced susceptibility or resistance to meropenem. The
blaOXA−48 positive isolates co-harbored variants of β-lactamase
genes, and they also were associated with sequence types ST38,
ST405, and ST131. Additionally, blaOXA−48 positive E. coli clone
ST38 had been previously reported in France, Germany and
Algeria (Poirel et al., 2011; Kaase et al., 2016; Bouaziz et al.,
2017). In the current study, we ﬁrstly reported the occurrence
of blaOXA−48 positive E. coli clone ST38 from a sucking piglet
with diarrhea in Shaanxi. Clone ST38 has achieved notoriety as
it is now rapidly and globally disseminated, and its potential to
serve as a vehicle for spread of carbapenemases is profoundly
alarming. blaNDM−1 producing E. coli isolate, emerging as a
public health threat, has gained global attention as it could
hydrolyze almost all β-lactams with the exception of aztreonam
(Nordmann et al., 2012), and it has previously been detected
in E. coli isolates from pigs (Fischer et al., 2012). Our results
revealed that blaNDM−1 and other β-lactamase genes coexisted
in one isolates, it is a potential public health concern as the pig
carrying blaNDM−1 and other β-lactamase genes may enter the
food chain.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, all ESBL-producing E. coli isolates both from
healthy and diarrheal pigs in Northwest China exhibited MDR
phenotype. The blaCTX−M−14 and qnrS were the predominant
β-lactamase gene and PMQR gene in ESBL producers,
respectively. estA and F4 were the most prevalent enterotoxin
and ﬁmbrial adhesin, respectively. One ST131 isolate harbored
β-lactamase genes blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX−M−9, blaCTX−M−14,
blaCTX−M−64,
and
blaKPC−2, as well as PMQR genes qnrS, qnrB, qnrD, qepA and
aac(6’)-Ib-cr. The ﬁndings could provide useful information for a
national monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from
food animals in China.
