Abstract
The aim of this study was to ﬁnd the prevalence of b-haemolytic Escherichia coli in milk, as well as their sources, and their
sensitivity to antibiotics. E. coli was isolated from samples of cow and camel milk, cow and camel udder surfaces, and
milking persons’ hands. The organisms were identiﬁed using API20E biochemical kit. Haemolytic activity was tested on
7% deﬁbrinated sheep blood agar while antibiotic sensitivity was tested using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. The
prevalence of b-haemolytic isolates from cow and camel milk was 25% and 32% respectively. None of the isolates from
the udder swabs, the milking persons’ hands, or water was b-haemolytic. In cow milk, the prevalence of isolates resistant to
Ampicillin, Cefotaxime, and Cefepime was 25, 37.5 and 12.5% respectively, while in camel milk it was 52.4, 23.8 and
28.6% respectively. Prevalence of b-haemolytic and multidrug resistant isolates to the three antibiotics was 12.5% for cow
milk and 19% for camel milk. None of the isolates was resistant to Ciproﬂoxacin, Piperacillin/Tozobactam, Amikacin, and
Imipenem. The prevalence of E. coli resistant to Cefotaxime and Cefepime indicates growing resistance of the microor-
ganisms to drugs that are supposed to be effective against them. The presence of b-haemolytic isolates in milk and their
absence on the animals’ udder surface and hand swabs could indicate their better survival in the udder from which they are
shed into the milk. This is a public health concern especially for pastoral communities who have a preference for
consumption of raw milk.

1 Introduction

Kenya’s dairy sector is estimated to be worth USD 1 billion
with annual milk production of 4.5 billion litres of which
86% is from cows, 10% is from camels and the rest from
goats (GOK 2010). The country’s milk production from
cows is dominated by Smallholder farmers while camel

milk production is dominated by pastoralists (FAO 2011).
Smallholder and pastoral milk producers are faced with
many challenges in delivering good quality milk to the
market. These include lack of proper hygiene during
milking due to lack of water in the arid and semi-arid
pastoral production areas. Water quality for udder prepa-
ration and cleaning of milk containers has been reported to
be either scarce or of questionable quality (Noor et al.
2013). The level of hygiene in milk is indicated by the
presence of coliforms in milk, which Escherichia coli is a
dominant member. Presence of E. coli also indicates the
presence of other enteric pathogenic microorganisms in the
milk (Baylis et al. 2011) since it is associated with the guts
of warm blooded animals and is frequently shed in the
stools of these animals (Fernandes 2008). The microbes
would then contaminate the udder and move up the teat
canal not only contaminating the milk but also causing
mastitis (Jay et al. 2005). Due to this relationship, the type
of mastitis caused by E. coli has been demonstrated to be

123

environmental mastitis rather
than contagious mastitis
(Khan and Khan 2006; Ahmed and Shimamoto 2011; Iyer
et al. 2014). The lactating animals suffering from mastitis
then shed culprit microbes with the milk (El-Ziney and Al-
Turki 2008; Fernandes 2008). It has also been shown that
cow and camels suffer from udder mastitis in the same way
and the implicated microbes are the same (Iyer et al. 2014).
Since mastitis is a disease condition in lactating animals,
the E. coli that would be implicated are the pathogenic
types with haemolysin production being one way in which
the microbes express pathogenicity (Naveen and Mathai
2005). Haemolysin production in E. coli has also been
associated with strains that cause enteric diseases in some
species of animals and extra-intestinal diseases in man
(Short and Kurtz 1971).

In Kenya, the bacteria that contribute most to human
infections are those in which drug resistance is most evi-
dent, and these include pathogenic E. coli (GARP 2011).
However, like in most of the African continent, there is no
formal system for surveillance of antibiotic resistance in
agricultural bacterial isolates (GARP 2011). E. coli has
been demonstrated to be resistant to a number of antibiotics
including ampicillin, ciproﬂoxacin, Cefepime, amikacin,
and imipenem in human patients (Neto et al. 2003; Brinas
et al. 2005; Chong et al. 2009) and dairy cows (Adefurin
et al. 2011; Davies et al. 2015). Resistance of E. coli to
third generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime is due
to the presence of plasmid mediated Extended Spectrum
Beta Lactamase (ESBL) enzymes that are capable of
hydrolyzing all beta lactams (Ahmed and Shimamoto
2011). The resistance gene can be acquired by a pathogen
via horizontal gene transfer from one organism to another
or by mutation though some organisms are inherently
resistant (Vincent et al. 2010).

Previous studies indicate increasing resistance of E. coli
to prescribed antimicrobials, especially, beta-lactams
which makes empirical treatment of infections difﬁcult
(Neto et al. 2003; Vincent et al. 2010). Many of these
studies have been done on patients with urinary tract
infections, a few in mastitis animals and even fewer in
foods. However, we are not aware of any research that has
associated b-haemolytic E. coli
to antibiotic resistance
despite the compelling evidence that food could be a
reservoir for E. coli that causes community acquired uri-
nary tract infections (Vincent et al. 2010) and also a source
of resistant bacteria (CDC 2013). Presence of pathogenic
E. coli in milk is thus a public health concern especially for
smallholder and pastoral communities where there is a lot
of human contact with milk during milking, transportation
and bulking. Pastoral communities too, have a preference
for consumption of raw milk that increases risk of infection
(Kaindi et al. 2011). The aim of this study was therefore to
ﬁnd the prevalence of b-haemolytic E.coli
in milk,

establish their sources and the sensitivity of these patho-
types to selected antibiotics.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Sample collection, study area

The study was carried out between February and June
2016. Milk samples were taken directly from the udder
during milking for both cow and camel milk. For cow milk,
milk samples were also taken from bulking centres and
milk bars while for camel milk, samples were taken from
the secondary collection centre in Isiolo town and from the
Nairobi market (Nato et al. 2018). For the purpose of this
study, samples collected during milking were labelled as
udder milk while those collected along the value chain
were labelled as post-udder milk. The value chain in this
context includes milk collection and bulking centres where
milk may be cooled while either awaiting transportation to
the processing plant or sale to consumers (Nato et al.
2018). For cow milk, samples were collected from 47 cows
on 16 farms with 2–4 lactating cows per farm. Two farms
had two milking persons while the rest had one each.
Samples of water used for handwashing, udder and
receptacle cleaning were taken from 10 farms since some
farms shared water wells. Udder swabs from the lactating
animals and hand swabs from the milking persons were
also taken, as well as water for washing milking persons’
hands, cow udders and milk receptacles. For camel milk,
samples were collected from 3 kraals, each with a popu-
lation of 9, 12 and 13 lactating camels. In each kraal, at
least 2 camel udders were swabbed, and each of the kraals
had at least two milking persons, both milking one camel at
a time. However, for camel milk, only water for receptacle
cleaning was sampled since udder cleaning and hand-
washing before milking was not practiced. For cow milk,
21 milk samples were collected from each of the 3 bulking
centres within Nakuru County. Two of the bulking centres
were owned by farmers’ co-operative societies while one
bulking centre was owned by a commercial milk processor.
The rest of the milk samples were collected from 10 milk
bars within Nakuru town, taking 3 milk samples from each
milk bar. The milk samples from the bulking centres and
milk bars constituted post-udder milk. Along the camel
milk value chain, 46 milk samples were taken from the
secondary collection centre in Isiolo town and 55 milk
samples were collected from the Nairobi market. Milk
collected from both the collection centre and Nairobi
market constituted post-udder milk.

The milk and water samples were collected in 60 ml
sterile bottles while hand and udder swabs were taken
using sterile cotton swabs and put in 10 ml peptone water

in diluent bottles. Samples from the pastoral camel milk
producers from Northern Kenya (Isiolo) were taken to the
Isiolo County referral hospital laboratories for culturing,
while samples taken from Nairobi market were cultured at
the University of Nairobi laboratories. Samples from the
Smallholder cow milk producers within Nakuru County
were cultured at the Egerton University laboratories where
isolation and biochemical identiﬁcation was done for all
isolates. All the samples were transported at 4–7 °C in a
cool box, and refrigerated before culturing.

2.2 Isolation and identification of E. coli

The isolates were cultured on Eosin Methylene Blue agar
(Oxoid, Hampshire, England) at 37 °C for 24 h. This was
repeated until discrete dark colonies with or without a
metallic sheen were isolated. Single colonies were picked
and transferred to nutrient agar slants for morphological
examination. Colonies that were Gram negative short rods
were further identiﬁed using the API20E system (bioMer-
eux SA, Lyon, France) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. The isolates were diluted to 0.5 McFarland
standards before inoculation onto the ampules. The strips
were incubated at 35 ± 2 °C for 24 h and the colour
change in the ampules recorded as positive or negative.
The microbial identity was done using an API20E software
version 4.1 (bioMereux SA, Lyon, France). The remaining
colonies were kept in 1 ml of 1 M sucrose solution in 2 ml
cryo-vials and stored at - 18 °C to await further analysis.
When required,
the stored culture was re-cultivated in
nutrient broth at 37 °C for 24 h.

2.3 Test for Beta haemolysis

Test for haemolytic activity was done by plating the iso-
lates on Blood agar (Oxoid, Hampshire, England) with 7%
deﬁbrinated sheep blood at 37 °C for 24 h. In summary,
the blood was obtained from ewes on the Egerton
University farm using sterile hypodermic syringes. The
blood was deﬁbrinated and mixed by swirling with the
blood agar base at a temperature of 45 °C then pouring
about 20 ml onto sterile plates and allowed to set. The
isolates were then streaked onto the solid plated and
incubated to at 37 °C for 24 h after which haemolysis was
observed (Fig. 1).

2.4 Antibiotic sensitivity testing

The b-haemolytic isolates were tested for antibiotic sensi-
tivity based on the principle of the Kirby-Bauer disc dif-
fusion method (Bauer et al. 1966). Ampicillin was chosen
for this study because it was reported to be the drug of
choice by the Veterinary ofﬁcers in the study areas. This

Fig. 1 A section of a Blood agar plate with 7% sheep blood
inoculated with beta-hemolytic E. coli showing a clear zone

was corroborated by a study by Lamuka et al. (2017) which
found Ampicillin administration at 27% for treatment of
camel infections in Isiolo County. To expand the study,
antibiotics recommended for treatment of Gram negative
infections in human populations were also included in the
study. These are Beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and ﬂu-
oroquinolones (Tamma et al. 2012). The Beta-lactams
included cephalosporins, with Cefotaxime and Cefepime
representing the third and fourth generation cephalosporins
respectively; and carbepenem represented by Imipenem.
Ciproﬂoxacin and Amikacin represented Fluoroquinolone
and Aminoglycosides respectively while Piperacillin/To-
zobactam (Penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor) was used to
test susceptibility in the event the test organisms were
resistant to Beta-lactams. All the antibiotic susceptibility
discs were sourced from Lioﬁlchem (Italy). Brieﬂy, sterile
solid plates of Muller-Hinton agar (Oxoid, Hampshire,
England) were prepared and a broth of E. coli adjusted to
0.5 McFarland turbidity standards spread on its surface.
Antibiotic discs were then carefully put on the solid plate,
the plate inverted, and incubated at 35 ± 2 °C for 24 h.
The inhibition zone was measured as diameter across the

in mm and interpreted according to the Clinical & Labo-
ratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommendations (CLSI
2016). E. coli ATCC 25922 was used as a standard.

2.5 Data analysis

Chi square test of equality of proportions for independent
samples was used to compare prevalence of E. coli isolates
and their antibiotic sensitivity, between cow and camel
milk, and between udder milk and post-udder milk. The
null hypothesis of equal proportions was rejected and that
proportions were unequal if p B 0.05. SAS version 9.3
(SAS institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA) was used for all
computations.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Haemolytic activity

The sample type, number of samples taken, number of
E. coli isolates and those tested for haemolytic activity and
antibiotic sensitivity are shown in Table 1. Plates which
had a clear zone around the colony were b-haemolytic,
while those without a clear zone were considered non-
haemolytic. The proportion of E. coli isolates that tested
positive for beta-haemolysis were 25% and 33.3% for cow
milk and camel milk respectively. None of the isolates
from udder swab, milking persons hand and water were
positive for beta-haemolysis.

Presence of E. coli from 142 cow milk samples was
90.1% which was signiﬁcantly lower than 96.2% in camel
milk from 136 milk samples, with p B 0.05. Prevalence for
b-haemolytic E. coli as a proportion of E. coli isolates was
not signiﬁcantly different between cow and camel milk.
The prevalence was 25.0% of 128 E. coli isolates for cow
milk and 32.1% of 131 E. coli isolates for camel milk, with

p = 0.1439. Along the chain, the prevalence of b-haemo-
lytic E. coli in milk as a proportion of total E. coli in both
cow and camel milk collected during milking (udder milk)
was not signiﬁcantly different from that isolated from milk
from the rest of the value chain (post-udder milk). Simi-
larly, prevalence of b-haemolytic E. coli as a proportion of
total E. coli isolates between cow and camel udder milk,
and between cow and camel post-udder milk was not sig-
niﬁcantly different as shown in Table 2. In both cow and
camel milk, the proportion of b-haemolytic E. coli was
signiﬁcantly higher in post-udder milk compared to that of
the udder milk. This is shown in Table 3.

It has since been established that E. coli causes infec-
tions due to the presence of virulent factors which include
beta-haemolysins, ESBL and bioﬁlms which endow it
ability to survive, multiply and cause disease (Kukanur
et al. 2015). The presence of E. coli with these virulent
factors in milk and not on the udder surface, milking per-
sons’ hands and water therefore indicate the adaptation and
colonization of these microbes in the lactating animals’
udder. It has been shown that E. coli is one of the major
microorganisms isolated from camel mastitis milk (Ab-
delgadir 2014), and in Kenya, Wanjohi et al. (2013)
reported that the prevalence of E. coli isolated from camel
milk was 60%. Indeed, a previous study by the authors
indicated high levels of coliforms, which E. coli
is a
member, in camel milk in Kenya (Nato et al. 2018).

In this study, it is probable that the b-haemolytic E. coli

diseased tissues because they have selective advantage by

pathogenicity by destroying phagocytic and epithelial cells
(Kukanur et al. 2015). The predominance of b-haemolytic
E. coli in the udder milk could be because the protein

upon receiving certain signals from the host (China and
Goffaux 1999), which in this study points at the udder of

or the plasmid, even though the virulence factor is not
expressed (Harel and Martin 1999).

3.2 Haemolytic activity and antibiotic sensitivity

Prevalence of ampicillin (AMP) resistant b-haemolytic
E. coli was 52.4% in camel milk which was signiﬁcantly
higher than 25.0% in cow milk at p \ 0.05. Resistance to
cefotaxime (CTX) was at 37.5% for isolates from cow milk
which was not signiﬁcantly different compared to 23.8%
for isolates from camel milk. Similarly, resistance to
cefepime (FEP) for isolates from cow milk was at 12.5%
and was not signiﬁcantly different from that of camel milk
which was 28.6%. Multidrug resistance to AMP/CTX/FEP
too was not signiﬁcantly different with 12.5% for isolates
from cow milk and 19.0% for those from camel milk
(Table 4). None of the b-haemolytic E. coli isolates was
resistant to Piperacillin/Tozobactam, Ciproﬂoxacin, Ami-
kacin, and Imipenem.

The emergence and spread of resistance of pathogens to
antimicrobials is a worldwide phenomenon which may
arise from their overuse, inadequate dosing, poor adher-
ence, and substandard antimicrobials (GARP 2011; Patel
and Levitin 2014). These antimicrobials are used in the
control of diseases in human, animals and crops. In Kenya,
penicillins are the most prescribed antibiotics in human
subjects (GARP 2011) despite the fact that it is rarely
recommended for treatment of serious Gram negative
infections
study, although the

(CDC 2013).

In this

resistance of b-haemolytic E. coli from cow and camel
milk to AMP was 25% and 52.4% respectively, it was
lower than 89% for E. coli isolates from healthy human
subjects in Kenya (GARP 2011). The higher resistance in
isolates from human sources is likely due to overuse of the
antibiotic in human populations with contribution of con-
sumption of animal products with high antibiotic levels.
Indeed, Lamuka et al. (2017) reported that 46% of the
pastoralists administer veterinary drugs to sick camels
without seeking services of veterinary ofﬁcers. This results
to either underdosing, overdosing, or administering the
wrong drug to the animal and lack of observation of
withdrawal periods. The signiﬁcantly higher resistance of
isolates from camel milk compared to cow milk can
therefore be attributed to the lack of antibiotic stewardship
in administration of antibiotics to camels in the study area.
The resistance to AMP can also be used to predict resis-
tance to amoxyllin (CLSI 2016) which was also found by
Lamuka et al. (2017) to be in common use among the
pastoralists for treatment of camels, and also commonly
prescribed to human populations in Kenya (GOK 2016).
From our data however, it was not possible to directly link
the cause for resistance of the pathogens to CTX and FEP
because the drugs are not used in the study area for animal
disease management, but are listed for use in human
treatment
in Kenya (GOK 2016). There is therefore a
possibility of resistant strains from human subjects being
passed on to animals. It could also be due to inherent
ESBL’s in the microbes. This is because resistance to CTX
is a good marker of ESBL prevalence (Wiedemann et al.
2014), and demonstrates the ability of the E. coli strains to
be resistant
third generation cephalosporins
(Paterson and Bonomo 2005). The level of resistance to
Cefepime is of great concern being that it was only intro-
duced into clinical practice in the 1990s and recommended
for treatment of enterobacteriaceae infections. More so, in
previous studies, FEP has been demonstrated to have
‘in
ESBL-producing

activity

123

enterobacteriaceae (Nogueria et al. 2011). This ﬁnding
therefore demonstrates the prevalence of ESBL producing
E. coli in the study area reducing treatment options for both
infected persons and animals. This is because some
ESBL’s are known to destroy AMP, second, and third
generation oxyimino-cephalosporins (Shaikh et al. 2015). It
is however positive that none of the isolates was resistant to
the second-line and last line agent, ciproﬂoxacin and Imi-
penem respectively. Ciproﬂoxacin is however restricted to
high-level facilities,
in this case, district hospitals and
above (GARP 2011) which implies that individuals infec-
ted with these microbes cannot get treatment at lower
medical facilities such as dispensaries. In addition, the use
of ciproﬂoxacin in paediatric patients has been limited due
to the possibility of arthropathy (Adefurin et al. 2011) and
therefore children remain at great risk if infected. The use
of last line carbepenem (Imipenem) would result in selec-
tion of carbepenem resistant enterobacteriaceae which is an
emerging global time-bomb.

In conclusion, this study established that the source of
b-haemolytic E. coli
in milk was inside the lactating
animals’ udder. There’s therefore need for antibiotic
stewardship so that the right antibiotic is administered in
the right way for the right infection. In this case, there
should be a shift from blanket administration of peni-
cillins to treat mastitis infections in the study areas to
pathogen-speciﬁc antibiotic prescription based on micro-
bial culture results. Meanwhile,
the veterinary ofﬁcers
should change from penicillin drugs to E. coli (Gram
negative) sensitive antibiotics for the treatment of mastitis
in case the infected animals do not respond to antibiotics
targeting Gram-positive microbes. However there is still
controversy on whether treatment regimens for mastitis
caused by Gram-negative microbes is effective or not.
Prevention of mastitis infection should be primary in
improvement of animal health. Interventions for micro-
biological contamination of milk should start from udder
health instead of focusing only on nodes along the value
chain. It is also important for pastoral communities to
desist from tasting and consuming raw milk due to the
presence of b-haemolytic E. coli strains in the milk. More
concerted efforts should be deployed towards periodical
tracking of resistant patterns of E. coli in milk.
