Abstract The aim of this study was to determine the preva-
lence and antimicrobial resistance of mecA and mecC
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in cattle,
sheep, and goat dairy farms in Jordan. Milk samples were
collected from bulk tanks at 117 dairy farms (44 cattle, 47
sheep, and 26 goat dairy farms) in each region of the country.
MRSA were isolated on mecA and mecC chromogenic media
and confirmed by PCR. The confirmed isolates were tested for
resistance toward 15 antimicrobials by the disc diffusion
method. None of the tested bulk milk samples were positive
for mecC and 26% (95% CI 20–32%) were positive for mecA
MRSA. Specifically, mecA MRSA was detected in 31.8%
(95% CI 17.5–46.1) of cattle, 29.8% (95% CI 16.2–43.4) of
sheep, and 11.5% (95% CI − 1.6–24.7%) of goat dairy farms.
All isolates (n = 86) exhibited resistance to penicillin, oxacil-
lin, cefoxitin; meanwhile, most isolates (70–85%) exhibited
resistance toward gentamicin, clindamycin, rifampicin, neo-
mycin, fusidic acid, erythromycin, tetracycline, and ciproflox-
acin. All mecA MRSA isolates were resistant to at least one
class of antimicrobials. Isolates from all goat milk, 88% of
cattle milk, and 87% of sheep milk samples exhibited resis-
tance to three classes of antimicrobials and were considered

multidrug resistant (MDR). These data demonstrate wide-
spread MDR MRSA in dairy ruminants in Jordan, and these
rates are higher than those reported in other countries. Such
high prevalence of MDR MRSA and mecA MRSA could lead
to economic losses in the dairy industry in Jordan and poses a
possible public health risk.

Introduction

Staphylococcus aureus is an important causative agent of
foodborne illness in humans and mastitis in dairy ruminants
((CDC), 2014; Painter et al. 2013). S. aureus has a unique
ability to adapt rapidly to antimicrobials and has developed
resistance to methicillin and penicillin and most recently to
daptomycin and linezolid which is a growing problem
(Pantosti et al. 2007). Methicillin resistance by S. aureus is
encoded by mecA and mecC genes. Those methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus MRSA carry the staphylococcal cas-
sette chromosome (SCCmec) and resistant beta-lactam anti-
microbials. While both mecA and mecC exhibit resistance to
cefoxitin, mecC is sensitive and mecA is resistant to oxacillin
(Cartwright et al. 2013; Kim et al. 2012).

MRSA is a significant cause of mastitis in ruminants world-
wide (Feßler et al. 2010; Vanderhaeghen et al. 2010a; Aras
et al. 2012; Pilla et al. 2013; Guimaraes et al. 2017). In the case
of subclinical mastitis, MRSA does not change the organoleptic
characteristics of milk, thus it can be transmitted through milk
and dairy products to humans. The prevalence of MRSA in
bovine milk and its zoonotic transmission between farmers
and ruminants have been reported by several studies (Feßler
et al. 2010; Vanderhaeghen et al., 2010a, b; Spohr et al. 2011;

Caruso et al. 2016). Studies have reported low prevalence of
MRSA in cattle milk, ranging from 0.3% in the UK to 9% in
Belgium (Vanderhaeghen et al. 2010a; Paterson et al. 2012;
Parisi et al. 2016). Moreover, mecC MRSA has been isolated
at low rates from bovine milk in European countries including
Spain and UK (Ariza-Miguel et al. 2014; Paterson et al. 2014).
In contrast, a limited number of studies have investigated the
prevalence of MRSA in small ruminants’ milk (Aras et al.
2012; Foti et al. 2012; Cortimiglia et al. 2015; Caruso et al.
2016). But, consumption of dairy products made from raw
sheep and goats milk is widespread, especially in
Mediterranean countries, where some traditional goat or sheep
cheeses are made exclusively from raw milk (Hilali et al. 2011).
Anecdotal evidence reported by Jordanian field veterinar-
ians suggests the high frequency of drug-resistant mastitis
cases in dairy ruminants of Jordan. This study aimed to (1)
determine the prevalence of mecA- and mecC-positive S.
aureus (MRSA) in cattle, sheep, and goat bulk milk and (2)
determine the antimicrobial resistance of the isolated mecA
and mecC-positive S. aureus.

Materials and methods

Sample population

Milk production is an important part of the agricultural sector
of Jordan and includes cattle, sheep, and goat milk. Dairy
cattle have two production systems, large (intensive)- and
small-scale systems. Both systems raise Holstein-Friesian
dairy cows and contribute $160 million annually to the nation-
al gross domestic product (DoS 2015).

The large production system uses modern management
practices with zero-grazing and located in Al-Dulial area
(East-Northern area of Jordan) which produces around 50–
60% of the milk in Jordan (DoS 2015). The small-scale sys-
tem houses cows in small traditional brick barns, with tradi-
tional management practices and is scattered throughout
Jordan but mainly located in the Badia and the Northern
highlands regions. Small ruminant dairy farms are more
scattered in Jordan compared to the dairy cattle farms. The
Badia region, which is an arid to semi-arid region, is located
in eastern and southern Jordan and occupied by nomadic or
pastoralist Bedouin people who raise small ruminants
(Tarawneh and Kadıoğlu 2003). It receives the highest
amounts of rainfall in Jordan and occupied by small herders
who rely on low production technologies (Tarawneh and
Kadıoğlu 2003). In contrast, the Northern highlands are char-
acterized by a narrow strip which is rugged and intersected by
deep valleys. The production system in the Highlands is ex-
tensive and uses rangelands under constant search for grass
and water.

Sample size

The prevalence of mecA and mecC MRSA in dairy ruminant
milk is unknown in Jordan. To detect a prevalence of
0.5 ± 0.1 at 95% confidence interval, using the formula
n = z2 p(1-p)/d2, the required sample size would be 96 farms.
A total of 117 farms were included in the study to account for
possible refusal. Specifically, 44 cattle, 47 sheep, and 26 goat
farms were randomly selected from different regions of
Jordan. The studied sheep and goat farms included 26 in
Northern Jordan, 22 in Southern Jordan, 15 in Badia, and 9
farms in the Jordan Valley. Cattle farms included 22 in Al-
Dulial area and 22 in the Northern Highlands. Data collection
occurred from December 2015 to March 2016 because during
this period, parturitions in sheep and goats in Jordan usually
occur (whereas, parturitions in cattle occur year around)
(Talafha and Ababneh 2011). In each farm, we sampled one
to two tanks based on availability for a total of 208 samples.

Sampling approach

In each governorate, private veterinarians were recruited to
assist with the data collection since they have strong ties with
the farmers (their clients). Farms were randomly selected from
a list of farms provided by the local veterinary associations for
inclusion in this study. Once a farm was selected for inclusion
in the study, we visited it and briefed the farm owner(s) about
the aims and the voluntary nature of the study. Farm owners
were assured that the study was for research purposes only and
that any data pertaining to their specific farm would be avail-
able to them upon request free of charge. Consent to collect
the milk samples was obtained from the owner of each farm
prior to starting the study.

Milk samples (100 mL) from bulk tanks were aseptically
collected by study personnel and samples were individually
packed in sterile cups and transported daily in an ice box under
cold conditions to the Food Safety and Zoonotic Diseases
Laboratory, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Jordan
University of Science and Technology. Upon arrival at the
laboratory, the samples were registered in the sample log book
and then kept in the refrigerator at 4 °C for 4 to 5 days then
frozen at − 20 °C prior to testing to help release the intracel-
lular S. aureus in milk somatic cells upon subsequent thawing
as done by others (Paterson et al. 2014).

Isolation of methicillin-resistant S. aureus from the milk
samples

MRSA was isolated from the milk samples as described pre-
viously (Paterson et al. 2014). Briefly, frozen samples were
thawed at 37 °C and 2 mL of milk was mixed with 8 mL of
Mueller-Hinton broth (Oxoid CM0405, Hampshire, England)
supplemented with 6.5% NaCl and incubated at 37 °C under

Trop Anim Health Prod

shaking at 200 rpm. Then, 100 μL of the culture was plated on
the chromogenic MRSA Brilliance 2 plates (Oxoid,
PO1210A) in triplicates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h.
Suspected MRSA colonies (blue color) were then subcultured
on the chromogenic Staph Brilliance 24 plates (Oxoid,
PO1186A). Isolated colonies were then stored in buffered
glycerol at −20 °C.

Molecular confirmation of methicillin-resistant S. aureus

Genomic DNA was extracted from the suspected isolates
using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (product code: 51304,
Qiagen, Germany) as specified by the manufacturer and using
20 mg/mL lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich; product code: L7651)
to lyse the bacterial cell wall. The DNA was then tested for
femB, mecA, and mecC by uniplex PCR using the same
primers and thermocylcing conditions as previously described
(Paterson et al. 2012). mecA and mecC produce 155- and 188-
pb products, which are close to each other on gel electropho-
resis (Paterson et al. 2012). Thus, uniplex PCR were per-
formed. The mecA-positive NCTC 12493 and the mecC-pos-
itive isolate LGA251 were used as positive controls (courtesy
of Paterson).

Antimicrobial resistance testing

Antibiotic susceptibility profiles were determined for all of
isolates by disc diffusion method on Mueller Hinton agar
(Oxoid Ltd.) using 15 different antimicrobial discs (Oxoid
Ltd . ) a c co r di ng t o th e Eur op e an Co mm itt ee o n
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAT 2016). Briefly,
pure frozen cultures were grown in on Mueller Hinton agar
overnight at 37 °C and three to five colonies were adjusted to
0.5 McFarland turbidity in normal saline tubes. The isolates
were tested for resistance to penicillins (penicillin; 10 units)
and oxacillin (ox, 1 μg)), cephalosporins (cefoxitin (FOX,
30 μg)), fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin (CIP, 5 μg)), tetracy-
clines (tetracycline (TE, 30 μg)), macrolides (clindamycin
(DA, 2 μg) and erythromycin (E, 15 μg)), phenicols (chlor-
amphenicol (C, 30 μg)), folate pathway inhibitors (sulfameth-
oxazole-trimethoprim (SXT, 25 μg)), aminoglycosides ((gen-
tamicin (CN, 10 μg)), oxazolidinones (linezolid (LZD,
10 μg)), fusidic acid (FD, 10 μg), neomycin (N, 10 μg),
mupirocin (MUP, 200 μg), and rifampicin (RD, 5 μg)
(Oxoid) according to EUCAST Guidelines (2016). Only five
discs per plate were tested to avoid overlapping zones of in-
hibition. S. aureus ATCC 29213 were used for quality control
and were tested in each replicate. Inhibition zones were mea-
sured after 18 h of incubation at 35 °C and the diameter of
inhibition around each disc was measured and interpreted ac-
cording to EUCAST Guidelines (EUCAST 2016).

An isolate was considered resistant when it was resistant to
one or more antimicrobials, and considered multidrug

resistant (MDR) when it was resistant to three or more classes
of antimicrobials (Schwarz et al. 2010). Moreover, an isolate
was classified as high or medium resistance if each tested
resistant to > 50 or ≤ 50% of antimicrobials, respectively.

Data analyses

The data were entered into MS Excel (Redmond, WA, USA)
and prevalence, confidence intervals, and proportions were
calculated using IBM SPSS 21.0 software (IBM SPSS
Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).

Results

Prevalence of mecA- and mecC-positive MRSA in bulk
tank milk

From the 208 bulk tank milk samples tested in this study, 54
samples tested positive for mecA S. aureus as confirmed by
PCR and 86 unique mecA MRSA isolates were obatained as
determined later by the antibiotic resistance profiles for iso-
lates from the same milk sample. None of the samples carried
mecC MRSA. The prevalence of mecA MRSA in bulk tank
milk sampled from cattle, sheep, and goat milk was 20.0, 39.1,
and 11.9%, respectively (Table 1). While, the farm level prev-
alence in cattle, sheep, and goat farms was 31.8, 30.4, and
15.4%, respectively (Table 1).

Antimicrobial resistance of mecA-positive S. aureus
isolated from cattle, sheep, and goat bulk tank milk

The percentage of antimicrobial-resistant isolates from bulk
tank milk sampled is shown in Table 2. Nearly all isolates
exhibited resistance toward penicillin, oxacillin, and cefoxitin,
while most isolates exhibited resistance toward gentamicin
(86.0%), clindamycin (86.0%), rifampicin (80.2%), neomycin
(79.1%), fusidic acid (79.1%), erythromycin (75.6%), tetracy-
cline (75.6%), and ciprofloxacin (70.9%). On the other hand, a
lower percentage of isolates exhibited resistance toward
mupirocin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, linezolid, and
chloramphenicol, 41.9, 30.2, 20.9, and 15.1%, respectively
(Table 2).

All (100%) of the mecA MRSA isolates were resistant to at
least one class of antimicrobials (Fig. 1). However, all goats,
88% of cattle, and 87% of sheep isolates exhibited resistance
to three classes of antimicrobials (i.e., exhibited multidrug
resistance [MDR]). All goat isolates were also resistance to
8 and more classes of antimicrobials and 25 and 19% of cattle
and sheep isolates exhibited resistance to 11 or more classes of
antimicrobials. Four percent of sheep isolates were resistant to
all 13 classes of antimicrobials tested (Fig. 1).

Antimicrobial resistance profiles

Forty-seven antimicrobial resistance profiles were exhibited
by the MRSA isolates; 17 profiles by isolates from cattle, 32
profiles by isolates from sheep, and 5 profiles by isolates from
goats (Supplementary Table). The profiles were diverse, espe-
cially for cattle isolates, and most profiles were exhibited by
one isolate only. Three cattle and six sheep isolates exhibited
the same profile, which corresponds to 14 antimicrobials
(RdLzdNSxtEDaCipPOxTeCnFoxFdMup) (Supplementary
Table).

Discussion

The prevalence of MRSA and its resistance to a wide range of
antimicrobials are growing worldwide concerns
(Vanderhaeghen et al. 2010b). Over the last two decades, sci-
entists have reported increasing prevalence of the mecA gene
which carries resistance to multiple antibiotics (Pantosti et al.
2007; Spohr et al. 2011; Kreausukon et al. 2012; Al-Ashmawy
et al. 2016). mecA MRSA strains in bovine milk samples have
been reported in several countries (Kwon et al. 2005; Holmes
and Zadoks 2011; Feßler et al. 2012). During this time period,

mecA-negative MRSA strains in bovine milk samples have
also been reported (Kumar et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2014).
This could be explained by a recent report that some MRSA
S. aureus can possess mecA homologues like mecC or other
mechanisms that lead to β-lactam resistance (Garcia-Alvarez
et al. 2011; Paterson et al. 2012; Paterson et al. 2014). This
study adds to the growing literature about the prevalence of
mecA and mecC MRSA and presents the first set of data from
Jordan on this issue.

This study did not recover mecC- positive S. aureus in
cattle, sheep, and goat bulk milk. This corroborates a previous
study that reported that no mecC was detected in bovine bulk
milk from 625 farms in Scotland. However, the same study
detected mecC-positive S. aureus in 10 of 465 dairy cattle
farms sampled (prevalence 2.2%) in England and Wales
(Paterson et al. 2014). Also, in Europe, one isolate of
mecC-positive S. aureus was reported in sheep milk, where
this isolate was detected from 601 S. aureus isolates obtained
from milk samples of 229 dairy sheep farms in Spain (Ariza-
Miguel et al. 2014). mecC-positive S. aureus was also isolated
at a low rate in Finland (1 isolate from 135 S. aureus isolates)
from bovine mastitic milk samples (Gindonis et al. 2013).

Our study detected mecA S. aureus in 31.8, 29.8, and
11.5% of the cattle, sheep, and goat dairy farms in Jordan.

Our sample size was based on the largest number of samples
needed to detect 50 ± 10%, and further research with larger
sample sizes is needed to confirm these results. In contrast,
most worldwide studies to date have reported low
mecA-positive S. aureus prevalence. For example, an older
US study did not detect MRSA in a nationally representative
sample of bulk tank milk conducted by the US Department of
Agriculture’s (USDA) National Animal Health Monitoring
System (NAHMS) using phenotypic and genotypic methods
(USDA 2011). In Northern Italy, mecA-positive S. aureus was
detected in 2% (4 out of 197) in bulk tank milk samples from
dairy goat farms (Cortimiglia et al. 2015). In Southern Italy as
well, the prevalence of MRSA in bovine bulk tank milk was
2.5% (12/486) (Parisi et al. 2016) and in 2009 and 2010, the
prevalence was 4.4% (Kreausukon et al. 2012). No mecA-
positive S. aureus was detected in 100 bulk milk tank and
200 raw cheese samples in Switzerland in 2009 (Huber et al.
2010). The wide range in prevalence reported by the different
studies might be related to several factors including geograph-
ical location, sensitivity of the isolation methods, antimicrobi-
al use practices, farm biosecurity, production techniques, and
sample storage and handling (Sader et al. 2006; Chen et al.
2010). Our study targeted MRSA through primary enrichment
media followed by isolation on MRSA selective media rather
than isolating S. aureus then determining the mecA gene in the
isolates. Thus, our approach, which was used by several recent
studies, might lead to higher recovery of mecA-positive S.
aureus from the milk samples (Paterson et al. 2014).

Despite their significant contribution as sources of milk in
different countries worldwide, there is a scarcity of data on the
prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus in small rumi-
nants’ farms. Our study revealed high rates of mecA-positive
S. aureus in sheep (29.8% farm level) and goat (11.5% farm

level) dairy farms. These rates are higher than those reported
in other countries. For example, 0% of sheep farms and 0 to
2% of goat farms were positive in from Italy (Cortimiglia et al.
2015; Caruso et al. 2016). A low prevalence (0.3%) was also
reported in bulk tank milk in Italian dairy sheep farms
(Carfora et al. 2016). Our study showed that the prevalence
in sheep is higher than that in cattle in Jordan. This is similar to
findings from Iran (Rahimi et al. 2015). Although the latter
study reports nasal carriage of mecA-positive S. aureus in
ruminants, it showed that the prevalence in sheep and goat
was 14.1 and 25%, but the prevalence in cattle was 5.1%
(Rahimi et al. 2015).

In our study, nearly all mecA-positive S. aureus isolates
exhibited resistance to penicillin, oxacillin, and cefoxitin;
meanwhile most isolates exhibited resistance toward gentami-
cin (86.0%), clindamycin (86.0%), rifampicin (80.2%), neo-
mycin (79.1%), fusidic acid (79.1%), erythromycin (75.6%),
tetracycline (75.6%), and ciprofloxacin (70.9%). In Egypt,
similar trends were reported. Specifically, about 87.9 and
65.2% of the mecA-positive S. aureus isolates from raw milk
and dairy product were resistance to penicillin and tetracy-
cline, respectively (Al-Ashmawy et al. 2016). Meanwhile,
small percentages of the isolates exhibited resistance toward
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (25%), ciprofloxacin (30%),
and gentamicin (37%) in Egypt (Al-Ashmawy et al. 2016).
Similarly, mecA-positive S. aureus showed high resistance to
penicillin-G, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, tetracycline,
erythromycin, and gentamicin from cattle milk in India and
high resistance to tetracycline in studies from India and
Germany (Kumar et al. 2010; Kreausukon et al. 2012). A
German study also reported low rates of resistance to chlor-
amphenicol and ciprofloxacin (Kreausukon et al. 2012).
Resistance to gentamicin, clindamycin, and erythromycin is

of special concern, as these antimicrobials are among the few
drugs used for treating bovine mastitis that are not based on β-
lactams.

Our study showed that in total, 47 different resistance pat-
terns were exhibited by the mecA-positive S. aureus isolates,
of which 43 were exhibited by only one, two, or three isolates.
These data from Jordan are noteworthy for the high resistant
percentage and diverse resistance profiles of the mecA-posi-
tive S. aureus isolates to the tested antimicrobial agents. The
findings of this study are similar to those of other studies. For
example, ten resistance patterns were exhibited by 25 mecA-
positive S. aureus isolates from bovine mastitis in Germany, in
which resistance to only β-lactam antimicrobials and tetracy-
clines was the most common pattern and exhibited by 36% of
isolates (Feßler et al. 2010). Other studies reported different
antimicrobial resistance patterns by the mecA-positive S.
aureus recovered from different raw milk and dairy products
(Can and Çelik 2012; Al-Ashmawy et al. 2016; Xing et al.
2016). The heterogeneity of antimicrobial resistance patterns
among the mecA-positive S. aureus isolates may reflect the
microbial adaptive response to local antimicrobial usage prac-
tices, geographical location, and farm biosecurity and man-
agement (Cuny et al. 2015). Farm management and infrequent
cleaning/sanitation could be associated with the presence of
mecA-positive S. aureus in farms (Graveland et al. 2010;
Dorado-García et al. 2013). This is supported by the persis-
tence of the mecA-positive S. aureus in dairy goat farms,
where the same the mecA-positive S. aureus strain was isolat-
ed from both bulk tank milk and the udder of three goats 1 year
after the first isolation (Cortimiglia et al. 2015). Similarly, a
study in South Korea found identical mecA-positive S. aureus
strains in the same animals within the same farm after 1 year
(Lim et al. 2013). This phenomenon was reported over two
periods in Italian dairy sheep farms as well (Carfora et al.
2016).

The high prevalence of multidrug resistant mecA-positive
S. aureus can have a serious impact on animal health and can
result in an economic impact to the farmer. Moreover, there
are serious public health implications for the high prevalence
of multidrug-resistant mecA-positive S. aureus, namely, it can
be disseminated into human populations and can lead to nos-
ocomial MRSA infections. For example, a review of this topic
showed that livestock-associated MRSA accounts for up to
10% of MRSA septicemia and 15% of MRSA wound infec-
tions in humans (Cuny et al. 2015). The rate of zoonotic trans-
mission can pose greater risk for certain occupational groups
particularly like farmers and veterinarians compared to the
general population (Garcia-Graells et al. 2012; Klous et al.
2016) and isolates with identical MRSA genotype from
farmers and goats’ milk suggesting the zoonotic potential of
MRSA have been reported (Caruso et al. 2016; Carfora et al.
2016). In addition, a study showed that MRSA carriage in
people is strongly associated with both intensity of animal

Trop Anim Health Prod

contact and the percentage of MRSA-positive animals on a
farm (Graveland et al. 2010). The latter study also reported
that livestock-associated carriers lived significantly closer to a
livestock farm compared to non-carriers (Zomer et al. 2016).
Finally, the presence of mecA-positive S. aureus in raw milk in
Jordan indicates that consuming raw milk and traditional dairy
products like Bayda cheese could serve as a potential risk of
foodborne infection especially in light of a recent study that
found antimicrobial resistance was associated with harboring
enterotoxin genes in S. aureus isolates (Obaidat et al. 2015).
Thus, in Jordan, consumers may consider avoiding the con-
sumption of unpasteurized milk products.

In conclusion, the high prevalence of multidrug-resistant
mecA-positive S. aureus in this study shows that there is a
need for strict hygienic measures in the production of raw milk
and dairy products to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant
mecA-positive S. aureus.
