Objective: To determine antibiotic resistance patterns and virulence potential of Campylobacter 
jejuni (C. jejuni) isolates from clinical human diarrheal infections, cattle and healthy broilers. 
Methods: Antibiotic sensitivity patterns of C. jejuni isolates were determined by Kirby Bauer 
Disc Diffusion assay. These isolates were then subjected to virulence profiling for the detection 
of mapA (membrane-associated protein), cadF (fibronectin binding protein), wlaN (beta-1,3-
galactosyltransferase) and neuAB (sialic acid biosynthesis gene). Further C. jejuni isolates were 
grouped by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiling. Results: A total of 
436 samples from poultry (n=88), cattle (n=216) and humans (n=132) from different locations 
were collected. Results revealed percentage of C. jejuni isolates were 35.2% (31/88), 25.0% 
(54/216) and 11.3% (15/132) among poultry, cattle and clinical human samples respectively. 
Antibiotic susceptibility results showed that similar resistance patterns to cephalothin was 
ie. 87.0%, 87.1% and 89%among humans, poultry and cattle respectively, followed by 
sulfamethoxazole+trimethoprim 40.0%, 38.7% and 31.0% in humans, poultry and cattle and 
Ampicillin 40%, 32% and 20% in humans, poultry and cattle respectively. Beta-lactamase 
activity was detected in 40.00% humans, 20.37% cattle and 32.25% in poultry C. jejuni isolates. 
CadF and mapA were present in all poultry, cattle and human C. jejuni isolates, wlaN was not 
detected in any isolate and neuAB was found in 9/31 (36%) poultry isolates. RAPD profiling 
results suggested high diversity of C. jejuni isolates. Conclusions: Detection of multidrug 
resistant C. jejuni strains from poultry and cattle is alarming as they can be potential hazard 
to humans. Moreover, predominant association of virulence factors, cadF and mapA (100 % 
each) in C. jejuni isolates from all sources and neuAB (36%) with poultry isolates suggest the 
potential source of transmission of diverse types of C. jejuni to humans. 

1. Introduction

  Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) is an important food-born zoonotic 
pathogen, and one of the leading causes of human food borne 
illnesses (Campylobacteriosis) worldwide[1,2]. The most important 
source of transmission of this pathogen to humans is through 
contaminated animal products, especially poultry meat as well as

Biosciences, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Park Road, 44000,

direct contact with cattle shedding C. jejuni, or handling raw or 
undercooked poultry[3,4]. Campylobacter has been reported from 
broiler flocks in various European countries at the prevalence rates 
ranging from 38.1% to 79.2%[5,6]. Antibiotics play a vital role in 
human and veterinary medicine for treatment and prevention of 
infections but are also used as growth promoters in food animals[7]. 
Their increased use has resulted in the increased incidences of 
infection with enteric bacteria with higher levels of antibiotic 
resistance[8]. Campylobacter spp. has developed resistance to many 
clinically important antimicrobials, including fluoroquinolones (FQ) 
during the recent past[9-12]. It is believed that their transmission and 
spread are not only affected by the environmental and host factors, 
but also are influenced by the relative fitness of the drug-resistant 

198
organisms in the absence of selection pressure[13]. Campylobacter 
spp.  has  shown  resistance  to  a  large  number  of  beta  lactam 
antimicrobial agents. However, the behaviours of others, such as 
ampicillin and some of the expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, are 
variable and not very clearly defined[14].
  The current study gives the perspective of distribution of multiple 
antibiotic resistance, beta lactamase activity and virulence attribution 
to C. jejuni isolates from clinical human diarrheal infections, cattle 
and healthy broilers sharing the environment with the humans from 
the heavily populated city of Rawalpindi, Pakistan and its suburbs. 
Furthermore, their random amplification of polymorphic DNA 
(RAPD) profiling was carried out for determining their diversity. 

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sampling 

  This study was carried out from December 2011 and December 
2012. The samples were collected from poultry slaughter houses 
from one of the country’s leading poultry producer city, cattle 
farms and human clinical diarrheal cases. A total of 436 samples 
collected consisting of 216 cattle faecal samples, 132 human clinical 
samples and 88 poultry samples. Samples were collected in sterile 
cotton swabs containing Carry-Blair medium and transported to 
Microbiology Laboratory of COMSATS Institute of Information 
Technology, Islamabad.

2.2. Culturing and isolation

   The samples collected were streaked onto modified Charcoal 
Cefoperazone Deoxycholate Agar (mCCDA) (Oxoid, CM0739) 
containing CCDA selective supplement (Oxoid, SR0155). Samples 
were incubated in 2.5 litres airtight jar along with Campygen sachets 

(Oxoid, CN025A) to generate microaerophilic condition at 42 曟 for 
48-72 hours. Suspected Campylobacter colonies were subcultured on 
Muller Hinton Agar (Oxoid, CM0337) with addition of 5% sheep 
blood[15].

2.3. Biochemical identification

  Positive growth of Campylobacter isolates was further subjected to 
standard biochemical tests consisting of oxidase, catalase, indoxyl 
acetate and hippurate. In the case of indoxyl-acetate test, change of 
colour from colourless to blue green indicative of the presence of 
Campylobacter spp. and in case of hippurate hydrolysis, development 
of  blue/purple  colour  in  hippurate  solution  indicated  positive 
reaction for presence of C. jejuni with the production of hippuricase 
enzyme and clear or grey colouration indicate negative reaction for 
its presence. A positive test for both reactions was indicative of C. 
jejuni[16].

2.4. Molecular detection of C. jejuni

   Bacterial DNA was obtained by whole-cell lysate method as 
described by Singh et al. Primers used for confirmation of C. jejuni 
by PCR were MDS-16S rRNA (targeting 16S RNA gene), hipO 
(Hippurate hydrolysis gene) as described in Table 1. PCR was 
performed as previously described[17,18]. Amplified PCR products 
were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethedium bromide.  

2.5. Virulence typing

    C.  jejuni  isolates  were  screened  for  the  presence  of 
virulence  genes  (Table  1).  Primers  were  designed  against 
C. jejuni adhesin, cadF (fibronectin binding protein) (400 bp) gene, 
wlaN (putative beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase) (330 bp), neuAB 
(sialic acid biosynthesis gene) (755 bps) and mapA (membrane-
associated protein) (94 bps). 

2.6. RAPD PCR

    For  RAPD  analysis  of C. jejuni  OPA11  primer  was  used  as 
described by Hernandez et al. Briefly, the reaction mixture was 
carried out in a total volume of 25 毺L containing 40 ng total DNA 
of each strain, 1.36 pM primer), 1.6 U Taq DNA polymerase (Super 
Taq), 1.5 毺L 500 mM MgCl2, 0.7 毺L 10 mM dNTPs in 1X PCR 

buffer (Fermentas). The PCR products were then separated by 1.5% 
agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide 
staining.  Dendrogram  was  constructed  using  DendroUPGMA 
(genomes.urv.cat/UPGMA/) for RAPD PCR analysis.

2.7. Antimicrobial susceptibility profiling and beta-lactamase 
detection 

    Antibiotic  susceptibility  profiling  was  carried  out  using 
chloramphenicol  C  (30 毺g),  tetracycline  (TE)  (30 毺g), 
streptomycin (S) (10 毺g), ciprofloxacin (CIP) (5 毺g), amoxicillin 
clavulenic  (AMC)  acid  (30 毺g),  nalidixic  acid  (NA)  (30 毺
g),  erythromycin  (E)  (30 毺g),  gentamycin  (CN)  (10 毺g), 
sulphomethoxazole + trimethoprim (SXT) (25 毺g) and cephalothin 
(CEF), respectively (Oxoid, UK) as described by Gaudreau et al[19]. 
Analysis of zone diameter was done according to the CLSI (2010). 
Beta-lactamases were detected by use of Cefinase disks (BBL 
Microbiology Systems) as described by Lachance et al[20].

3. Results

3.1. PCR confirmation of Campylobacter isolates

  Biochemically verified C. jejuni strains were further subjected to 
PCR using primers against conserved 16S rRNA (amplification 
product 857 bps) and hip gene (hippurate hydrolysis gene) (344 bps).

3.2. C. jejuni distribution pattern among various sources

    Four  hundred  and  thirty-six  samples  were  analysed  in  this 
study.  100  out  of  a  total  of  436  samples  were  confirmed  as
C. jejuni ie., the overall prevalence rate was 100/436 (22.93%). The 
isolation rate of C. jejuni was (n=31) 35.2%, (n=54) 25.0% and 
(n=15) 11.3% in poultry, cattle and humans, respectively. 

3.3. Antimicrobial susceptibility profile

  Antibiotic resistance profile of C. jejuni isolates from humans, cattle 
and poultry sources was determined using 10 antibiotics according 
to CLSI 2010. Comparison of antibiotic susceptibilities of C. jejuni 
isolates from different sources is shown in Table 2. Antibiotic 
susceptibility of the isolates revealed that resistance to cephalothin 
was the most common ie. 87.0%, 89.0% and 87.1%, followed by 
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole  40.0%,  38.7%  and  31.0%  and 
amoxicillin clavulenic acid 40%, 32% and 20% in human, cattle 
and poultry respectively (Figure 1). Multidrug resistance was also 
identified in strains from different sources (Table 3). Gentamicin was 
found to be the most sensitive antibiotic with resistance of 7%, 0% 
and 9% in humans, poultry and cattle isolates.

   Beta-lactamase production was detected in 27 C. jejuni strains 
including 6 human, 10 poultry and 11 cattle strains. Thus, the overall 
frequency of beta lactamase producing strains in our study was 
27/100 (27%).  

3.4. RAPD Profiling 

  Analysis of C. jejuni isolates by RAPD profiling yielded 22 different 
banding profiles. Almost all the C. jejuni isolates were well dispersed 
among all clusters (Figure 2). However, five isolates did not produce 
any recognizable RAPD banding pattern.

  Virulence typing was performed using 4 genes as targets and results 
suggested that cadF and mapA (adherence factors) were present in 
all isolates studied whereas neuAB (invasive factor) was found in 9 
(36%) poultry samples only, whereas wlaN (invasive factor) was not 
present in any of the isolates (Figure 3).

C. jejuni in this study are in agreement with reports from other 
countries[24-30]. Antibiotic susceptibility profile of C. jejuni isolates 
was determined using 10 antibiotics and compared among poultry, 
cattle and humans isolates. The results of antimicrobial susceptibility 
testing in this study indicate that the isolates were in general resistant 
to the tested antibiotics at rates ranging from 7% to 87% in clinical 
cases, up to 87.1% in poultry and 6% to 89% in cattle. Higher rate of 
resistance (80.6%) to erythromycin was seen among C. jejuni isolates 
from poultry. Since the ingestion of the infected poultry meat may 
account for most of human campylobacteriosis cases, this fact 
becomes more relevant to public health  when seen in the context that 
Erythromycin is one of the commonly used drug for treatment of the 
patients. However, the frequency of resistance to ampicillin (40%), 
Tetracycline (27%) and gentamycin (7%) was comparable or lower 
than in the reports from most of the European countries[31,32]. Mostly 
tested isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol and gentamycin. 
Among the isolates from different sources overall resistance rates 
were different. Tetracycline was listed as an alternative treatment 
for Campylobacter gastroenteritis in the past and they are widely 
used therapeutically and sub therapeutically as feed additives for 
livestock and poultry[33]. In our study, resistance to tetracycline (7%) 
was lower than previous reports[34-36]. The identification of multiple 
antibiotic resistant C. jejuni isolates from poultry, cattle and humans 
is alarming as such resistance strains may cause more prolonged or 
severe illness[37].  Further, 27 C. jejuni isolates of during the current 
study were B-lactamase producers. This is of significance as beta 
lactams are generally the first line of drugs for treating hospitalized 
cases. Campylobacter spp. are generally inherently resistant to many 
beta-lactams, however, there are variable reports of resistance to 
beta-lactams and some of the expanded spectrum cephalosporins 
but it is not clearly defined[14]. In our study 6 human diarrheal, 
10 poultry and 11 cattle isolates were positive for resistance to 
B-lactams. 
  Virulence typing suggested that all isolates possess adherence 
property owing to the presence of cadF and mapA genes, while 36% 
of only poultry C. jejuni isolates possess in addition invasive property 
attributable to the presence of neuAB implying their possibility of 
association with more severe disease.  RAPD typing[38] results have 
shown the presence of 8 distinct types of C. jejuni. Despite some 
limitations, analysis of Campylobacter spp. isolates using RAPD has 
proved to be useful for preliminary characterization of strains[39] 
and the dendrogram constructed showed genetic diversity of isolates

4. Discussion 

  The aim of this study was to assess the C. jejuni isolates obtained 
from different sources on the basis of antimicrobial resistance and 
thereafter screening them for virulence factors. The isolates were 
further characterized using RAPD analysis for possible relatedness. 
Little data is available from Pakistan to compare our data, previously 
isolation rates of C. jejuni from humans have been reported to be 
29.5%[21], 12%[22] and 18%[23] and 21.5% Campylobacter spp. 
prevalence in food commodities[4]. While to our knowledge no 
reports are available for C. jejuni prevalence in poultry and cattle 
from Pakistan. The higher prevalence rates 100/436 (22.93%) of

from different sources. Three main clusters were clearly defined 

ie. clusters 栺, 栻 and 栿 based on RAPD profiling. All invasive 
strains (strains positive for neuAB) were present in cluster I whereas 
all multidrug resistant and beta lactamase producing strains were 
randomly distributed in all clusters. Our study have shown that 
RAPD PCR assay can act as rapid and effective molecular tool, 
which can be used in any basic microbiology laboratory, for studying 
C. jejuni isolates from different sources and discriminating virulent 
strains.  
  This study analyses C. jejuni strains in Pakistani poultry, cattle 
and  human  diarrheal  samples  particularly  with  regard  to  their 
antibiotic resistance and virulence profiling. As compared with 
European surveillance programmes, the prevalence and antibiotic 
resistance of C. jejuni in Pakistan are not monitored and isolation 
of multiple antibiotic resistance C. jejuni from poultry and cattle 
during the current study serves as impetus for more elaborate 
studies  regarding  the  prevalence  and  transmission  patterns  of
C. jejuni.
