Abstract

The objective of this study was to characterize the clonal profile, virulence factors and antimicrobial
resistance, particularly oxacillin resistance, of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from sheep milk. Milk
samples were collected from all teats for the California Mastitis Test (CMT), somatic cell count,
identification of S. aureus, investigation in these strains of genes encoding toxins (sea, seb, sec, sed,
tst), biofilm (icaA, icaC, icaD, bap), leukocidin (luk-PV) oxacillin resistance by mecA gene detection
and susceptibility testing (12 antibiotics). Messenger RNA expression was evaluated by RT-PCR in
isolates carrying toxin and biofilm genes. Biofilm formation was also evaluated phenotypically by
adherence to polystyrene plates. The clonal profile of S. aureus was investigated by pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis. A total of 473 milk samples were collected from 242 animals on three farms and 20
S. aureus strains were isolated and none carried the mecA gene. The two sec gene-positive isolates
and the isolates carrying the tst and luk-PV genes were positive by RT-PCR. Staphylococcus aureus
isolated from the three flocks studied showed high susceptibility to the drugs tested and none was
biofilm producer, indicating that biofilm formation was not a virulence factor causing infection by
these strains. The typing of 17 S. aureus isolates revealed the presence of a common clone on the
three farms studied, and the presence and expression of the sec and tst genes in one strain of this clone
suggest the possible acquisition of virulence genes by this clone, a fact that is important for animal
health and food hygiene.

Key words: mastitis, sheep, Staphylococcus aureus, antibiotic resistance, virulence factors.

Introduction

Mastitis is an inflammation of the mammary gland
which is characterized by physical, chemical and microbio-
logical alterations in milk and tissue abnormalities. Fur-
thermore, the disease is associated with premature culling
of ewes with udder abnormalities and reduced weight gain
of lambs. In the study of Moroni et al. (2007), the weight
gain of lambs nursing dams without mastitis was higher

than that of animals nursing ewes with subclinical mastitis.
Among the latter, lambs nursing dams with subclinical in-
fection caused by S. aureus showed lower weight gain than
those nursing dams with mastitis caused by other infectious
agents such as coagulase-negative staphylococci, strepto-
cocci, and Gram-negative bacteria.

In small ruminants such as sheep, coagulase-negative
staphylococci are the microorganisms most frequently iso-

lated from cases of subclinical mastitis (Bergonier et al.,
2003; Vautor et al., 2009), whereas S. aureus can cause
clinical and subclinical mastitis (Contreras et al., 2007). S.
aureus was the microorganism most frequently isolated
from milk of Awassi sheep with subclinical mastitis, ac-
counting for 39% of all isolates, followed by Streptococcus
spp. (25%), Escherichia coli (19.6%), and coagulase-nega-
tive staphylococci
(Al-Majali and Jawabreh,
2003). Santos et al. (2007) studied the clinical aspects and
milk characteristics of 10 Santa Inês sheep with clinical
mastitis after experimental inoculation of their mammary
glands with S. aureus. The results showed a reduction in
milk production and fat content, in addition to alterations in
the physicochemical properties of milk. After treatment, al-
though the animals had recovered from the disease, the
function of their mammary glands was completely lost.

(17.9%)

Mastitis caused by S. aureus can result in long-term
infection and can become chronic, with a low rate of cure
and consequent loss of milk production (Sabour et al.,
2004), since this microorganism possesses different viru-
lence factors that contribute to its persistence in mammary
tissue (Santos et al., 2003). Different virulence factors such
as enterotoxins, leukocidins and biofilms (Peacock et al.,
2002) are important since they contribute to aggravation of
the disease and are a matter of public health. Biofilm forma-
tion permits adherence and colonization of the mammary
gland epithelium (Otto, 2008), leukocidin causes tissues
necrosis and leukocyte destruction, and enterotoxins can
cause food poisoning (Argudín et al., 2010).

In addition to virulence, a major concern in the con-
trol of mastitis is resistance of the etiological agents to anti-
biotics. Therapeutic success is compromised by the
growing number of strains resistant to drugs used indis-
criminately in veterinary medicine. Staphylococcal resis-
tance to methicillin is associated with the acquisition of the
staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), a re-
sistance island consisting of the structural gene, mecA. S.
aureus strains carrying this gene are classified as methi-
cillin (oxacillin)-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). These strains
are frequently resistant to most antimicrobial agents, in-
cluding aminoglycosides, macrolides, chloramphenicol,
tetracycline, and fluoroquinolones (Wang et al., 2008; Ku-
mar et al., 2010).

Therefore, the objective of the present study was to
characterize the clonal profile, virulence factors and antibi-
otic resistance of S. aureus isolated from raw milk of sheep
with subclinical mastitis.

Materials and Methods

Origin of the isolates

Milk samples were collected from each teat of 242
sheep belonging to the following experimental flocks: 37
from the flock of Instituto de Zootecnia, Nova Odessa, 150
from the flock of Embrapa Pecuária Sudeste, São Carlos,

and 55 from the Edgardia Farm, Faculdade de Medicina
Veterinária e Zootecnia, Botucatu. All facilities are located
in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. The flocks from São
Carlos and Nova Odessa were Santa Inês sheep and those
from Botucatu were Bergamacia sheep. Milk samples were
collected from all animals for microbiological tests for the
isolation of S. aureus.

Screening for subclinical cases was performed imme-
diately before the collection of milk samples for the micro-
biological diagnosis of mastitis by the California Mastitis
Test (CMT) according to the technique of Schalm and
Noorlander (1957). Samples were also collected for so-
matic cell count (SCC) into flasks containing bronopol for
counting in an electronic Somacount 300 (Bentley Instru-
ments®). Mammary glands with a positive reaction in the
CMT or SCC > 3.0 x 105 cells/mL milk (McDougall et al.,
2001) and that were bacteriologically positive were classi-
fied as subclinical mastitis.

Isolation and identification of S. aureus

The milk samples were cultured on blood agar at
37 °C for 72 h. Suspected bacterial colonies were stained by
the Gram method for inspection of morphology. Colonies
characterized as Gram-positive cocci were submitted to
catalase and coagulase tests. The genus Staphylococcus
was differentiated from Micrococcus based on the oxida-
tion and fermentation of glucose, resistance to bacitracin
(0.04 U), and susceptibility to furazolidone (100 mg). S.
aureus was identified based on the fermentation of maltose,
trehalose, and mannitol (Cunha et al., 2004).

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Twenty S. aureus isolates were submitted to in vitro
susceptibility testing by the disk diffusion method accord-
ing to the guidelines of the Clinical Laboratory Standard In-
stitute (2012). The following 12 antibiotics were tested:
rifampicin (5 mg), linezolid (30 mg), vancomycin (30 mg),
clindamycin (2 mg), erythromycin (15 mg), penicillin
(10 UI), oxacillin (1 mg), cefoxitin (30 mg), tetracycline
(30 mg), gentamicin (10 mg), ciprofloxacin (5 mg), and
cotrimoxazole (25 mg).

DNA extraction and amplification by PCR for
detection of the mecA, biofilm (icaADBCand bap)
and exotoxin genes (sea, seb, sec, sed, tst and
luk-PV)

Total nucleic acid was extracted from Staphylococ-
cus spp. strains cultured on blood agar, inoculated individu-
ally into brain-heart infusion (BHI) broth, and incubated for
24 h at 37 °C. The Illustra® kit (GE Healthcare) was used
for extraction. Briefly, staphylococcal cells were first di-
gested with 10 mg/mL lysozyme and 20 mg/mL proteinase
K. Next, 500 mL lysis solution was added and the mixture
was centrifuged at 5,000 x g for 1 min. The supernatant was

transferred to a column and centrifuged at 11,000 x g for
1 min. The liquid part was discarded and 500 mL lysis solu-
tion was again added to the column. After centrifugation at
11,000 x g for 1 min and discarding the liquid part, 500 mL
washing solution was added and the column was centri-
fuged at 11,000 x g for 3 min. Next, the column was trans-
ferred to a 1.5-mL tube and 200 mL Milli-Q water (Milli-
pore, Eschborn, Germany) heated to 70 °C was used for
elution. The samples were centrifuged at 5,000 x g for
1 min and the column was discarded. The extracted DNA
was stored at -20 °C. For detection of the mecA, biofilm
(icaADBC, bap) and exotoxin genes (sea, seb, sec, sed, tst
and luk-PV), the primers shown in Table 1 and the parame-
ters recommended by the respective authors were used:
Murakami et al. (1991), Rohde et al. (2007), Arciola et al.
(2005), Cucarella et al. (2001), Johnson et al. (1991), and
Lina et al. (1999).

The agarose gels were prepared at a concentration of
2% in 1X TBE, stained with SYBR Safe DNA Gel Stain®
(Invitrogen), and visualized under a UV transilluminator.

Reactions that amplified fragments larger than 1,000 bp
were submitted to electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gel.

Confirmation of the expression of virulence factors

The expression of the genes encoding enterotoxin A,
B, C, D or toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1), biofilm
genes (icaADBC and bap) and luk-PV in the S. aureus iso-
lates in which these genes were amplified by PCR was con-
firmed by RT-PCR as described below.

RNA extraction

Total RNA was extracted from S. aureus cultured on
blood agar, inoculated individually into BHI broth, and in-
cubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The Illustra RNAspin Mini RNA
kit was used for extraction according to manufacturer in-
structions. For this purpose, 200 mL of the S. aureus culture
was transferred to a sterile 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube and cen-
trifuged at 10,000 x g for 1 min. Next, the supernatant was
discarded, 100 mL TE containing 2 mg/mL lysozyme was
added, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C.
For cell lysis, 350 mL RA1 buffer was added together with

3.5 mL b-mercaptoethanol. The solution was applied to
RNAspin Mini Filter units and centrifuged at 11,000 x g for
1 min. The filters were discarded after centrifugation. For
adjustment of the binding conditions, 350 mL 70% ethanol
was added to the filtrate and the mixture was transferred to
an RNAspin Mini Column and centrifuged at 8,000 x g for
30 s. For adsorption of RNA to the membrane, 350 mL
membrane desalting buffer was added and the mixture was
centrifuged at 11,000 x g for 1 min. The samples were then
washed in two steps. First, 600 mL RA3 buffer was added
and the column was centrifuged at 11,000 x g for 1 min. For
the second wash, 250 mL RA3 buffer was added and the
column was centrifuged at 11,000 x g for 2 min. The col-
umn was then transferred to a new 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube
for the elution of RNA. For this purpose, 45 mL RNA-free
water containing 5 mL guard RNA was added and the col-
umn was centrifuged at 11,000 x g for 1 min. DNase treat-
ment for complete elimination of possible DNA residues
consisted of the addition of 2 mL buffer and 2 mL DNase
and incubation of the mixture for 1 h at 37 °C. Next, 2 mL
Stop DNase was added and the mixture was incubated for
10 min at 65 °C for the inhibition of DNase. The extracted
RNA was immediately stored at -80 °C.

Preparation of cDNA

Two mixtures were prepared (Mix 1 and Mix 2). For
Mix 1, 14 mL RNA (divided into aliquots and treated with
DNase), 1 mL dNTP, and 4 mL nuclease-free water were
used (extraction kit). For Mix 2, 4 mL 5X First-Strand
Buffer, 1 mL DTT (0.1 M), and 1 mL SuperScript III
(200 U/mL) were used. Mix 1 was incubated in a thermo-
cycler for 5 min at 65 °C, removed from the thermocycler,
and immediately put on ice for approximately 5 min. Next,
Mix 2 (6 mL) was added and the sample was again placed in
the thermocycler and the program was continued with 30
cycles at 65 °C for 5 min, 25 °C for 5 min, 50 °C for 60 min,
70 °C for 15 min, and finished at 20 °C. The cDNA was
then frozen at -80 °C.

PCR amplification of cDNA

The cDNA obtained was submitted to RT-PCR to de-
termine the expression of toxin and biofilm genes using the
primers described in Table 1. The amplified products were
visualized by electrophoresis as described in item 2.4.

Investigation of biofilm formation by adherence to
polystyrene plates (Christensen et al., 1985)
modified by Oliveira and Cunha (2010)

The method of biofilm formation on culture plates
proposed by Christensen et al. (1985) and modified by
Oliveira and Cunha (2010) was used. This method is based
on the spectrophotometric determination of the optical den-
sity of the adherent material produced by the bacteria.

Cultures grown in TSB for 24 h and subsequently di-
luted 1:1 in TSB prepared with 2% glucose were used. The
tests were carried out in 96-well flat-bottom plates (Costar,
model 3599, Corning). The wells were filled in quadrupli-
cate with 200 mL of the diluted culture. The following inter-
national reference strains were included in all tests: S.
aureus ATCC 29213 (biofilm producer) as positive control
and ATCC 33591 (non-producer) as negative control, and
S. epidermidis ATCC 35983 (biofilm producer) as positive
control and ATCC 12228 (non-producer) as negative con-
trol, as well as sterile TSB. The plates were incubated for
24 h at 37 °C. After this period, the content of each well was
carefully aspirated with a multichannel pipette and the
wells were washed four times with 200 mL phosphate-
buffer saline, pH 7.2. The plates were dried at room temper-
ature for 1 h. Next, the wells were stained with 2% crystal
violet for one minute, the volume was aspirated, and excess
dye was removed by washing the plates with distilled water
using a multichannel pipette. The plates were then dried at
room temperature for 60 min and optical density was read
in a Labsystem Multiskan EX microplate reader equipped
with a 540-nm filter. The strains were classified as negative
when the cut-off value corresponded to the classification of
non-adherent, and as positive when the cut-off value corre-
sponded to the classification of weakly or strongly adher-
ent.

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)

PFGE of the S. aureus isolates was done according to
a modification of the protocol of McDougal et al. (2003). In
a previously weighed microtube, 0.5 mL of an overnight
culture of S. aureus was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 50 s.
After discarding the supernatant,
the microtube was
weighed again and 300 mL TE (10 mM Tris, 1 mM
EDTA, pH 8.0) plus the difference between the final and
initial weight in mL were added. The samples were left to
stand in a water bath for 10 min at 37 °C. After homogeni-
zation, 5 mL lysostaphin (1 mg/mL in 20 mM sodium ace-
tate, pH 4.5) and 300 mL low-melting agarose were added.
The mixtures were poured into plug molds and the plugs
were allowed to solidify. The plugs were then placed in
2 mL EC solution (6 mM Tris-HCl, 1 M NaCl, 100 mM
EDTA, 0.5% Brij-58, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% so-
dium lauryl sarcosinate) and incubated at 37 °C for at least
4 h. The EC solution was discarded and the plugs were
washed four times with 2 mL TE for 30 min at room tem-
perature.

Genomic DNA was restricted with SmaI (Fast Digest
SmaI®, Fermentas Life Science, Canada) in 50 mL restric-
tion buffer using half the plug. Electrophoresis was carried
out in a CHEF-DR III System® (BioRad Laboratories,
USA) using 1% agarose gel (Pulsed Field Certified Aga-
rose, BioRad Laboratories, USA) prepared in 0.5X TBE
under the following running conditions: pulse time of 5 to

S. aureus from sheep milk

40 s for 21 h; linear ramp; 6 V/cm; angle of 120°; 14°C;
0.5X TBE as running buffer. The Lambda Ladder PFG
Marker® (New England BioLabs) was used as molecular
marker. The gels were stained with GelRed® (10,000X in
water, Biotium, USA) for 45 min and photographed under
UV transillumination. For analysis of similarity, the Dice
correlation coefficient was calculated and a dendrogram
was constructed by the UPGMA method (unweighted pair
group method using arithmetic averages) using the
BioNumerics® software (version 6.1; Applied Maths, Bel-
gium).

Results

Microorganisms were detected in 169 (35.7%) of the
473 milk samples collected from the 242 animals included
in the study. Twenty (11.8%) of the microorganisms iso-
lated were identified as S. aureus, including 18 (90%)
strains isolated from cases of subclinical mastitis and only
two (10%) from animals without mastitis. Four of the 20
strains were isolated in the flock from Botucatu, two in the
flock from Nova Odessa, and 14 in the flock from São
Carlos.

icaA + icaD + icaB were concomitantly present in five iso-
lates, icaA + icaD in six isolates, three isolates only carried
the icaD gene, and one isolate only carried the icaB gene.
The bap gene was detected in four (20%) isolates, but none
of the strains expressed this gene.

None of the isolates exhibited a positive result in the
phenotypic test of biofilm formation on polystyrene plates.

Antimicrobial resistance

Typing

The mecA gene was not detected in any of the S.
aureus strains and most isolates were susceptible to all
antimicrobial agents tested, except for one strain that was
resistant to tetracycline.

Toxin detection

Seven (35%) of the S. aureus isolates carried one or
more exotoxin genes (Table 2). Three (15%) of these seven
strains that tested positive by PCR for exotoxin genes were
positive by RT-PCR. One isolate carrying the sec+tst genes
expressed the two genes concomitantly, one isolate carry-
ing the sea+seb+luk-PV genes expressed only the luk-PV
gene, and the third isolate positive for the sea+sec genes ex-
pressed only the sec gene.

Biofilm detection

With respect to biofilm genes (Table 3), the complete
icaADBC operon was detected in one of the isolates. The

Molecular typing by PFGE was performed on only 17
strains since three isolates from the São Carlos flock could
not be typed. PFGE (Figure 1) revealed the presence of two
clones, a larger one (clone 1) comprising 10 isolates (one
from Nova Odessa, five from São Carlos, and four from
Botucatu) and a smaller one (clone 2) comprising only two
isolates from São Carlos. The remaining five isolates (one
from Nova Odessa and four from São Carlos) exhibited a
polyclonal profile.

With respect to virulence factors (Table 4), in clone 1
(10 isolates) only one strain carried an enterotoxin gene and
the TSST-1 gene and expressed the two genes. The bap
gene was detected in one isolate and the icaB gene of the
icaADBC operon was detected in five isolates, but no ex-
pression of these genes related to biofilm formation was ob-
served.

None of the toxin genes studied was detected in clone
2 (two isolates). Regarding the genes for biofilm formation,
only the bap gene was detected in two isolates by PCR, but
not by RT-PCR. The genes of the icaADBC operon were
not detected in any of the isolates by RT-PCR.

With respect to the virulence of S. aureus isolated
from different flocks, it is important to highlight the detec-
tion of the sea + sec and sec + tst genes in two strains iso-
lated from the farm in Nova Odessa, with the expression of
SEC and TSST-1 being confirmed by RT-PCR (Figure 1).
In the flock from São Carlos, the luk-PV gene was detected
and expressed in one isolate. Additionally, four bap gene-
positive isolates were from this farm and one isolate carried
the complete icaADBC operon. No toxigenic S. aureus
strains were isolated from the farm in Botucatu; however,

fection of the mammary tissue that is difficult to treat (Ai-
res-de-Souza et al., 2007). In the present study, S. aureus
was identified in 20 (11.8%) milk samples collected from
sheep with subclinical mastitis.

The mecA gene was not detected in any of the S.
aureus strains studied. Vyletelová et al. (2011) also did not
find the mecA gene in S. aureus strains isolated from sheep
milk, whereas the gene was detected in 20 (6.1%) S. aureus
strains isolated from cow milk. According to Zafalon et al.
(2012), S. aureus strains that carry oxacillin resistance me-
diated by the mecA gene are generally more resistant to
other antibiotics than oxacillin-sensitive microorganisms.
In the present study, antimicrobial susceptibility testing re-
vealed only one S. aureus isolate that was resistant to tetra-
cycline. The remaining isolates were susceptibility to all
drugs tested. Similar results have been reported by Vylete-
lová et al. (2011) for S. aureus isolates from sheep. Pengov
and Ceru (2003), investigating S. aureus isolates obtained
from sheep milk samples, demonstrated high rates of sus-
ceptibility to the drugs tested. A resistance rate of 6.3% was
only observed for penicillin and ampicillin.

Intramammary infections caused by S. aureus can
have severe consequences for human health because of the
production of toxins by this microorganism. These toxins
are secreted and remain stable in milk, causing food poison-
ing (Balaban and Rasooly, 2000; Fagundes and Oliveira,
2004). In the present study, seven isolates carried at least
one enterotoxin gene or the TSST-1 gene, with the seb gene
being the most frequent enterotoxin followed by the sea

the icaADC genes were detected in four strains isolated
from animals of this flock.

Discussion

S. aureus is a versatile microorganism that causes in-
fection in different hosts. Moreover, this bacterium is one
of the most important pathogens in the etiology of infec-
tious mastitis in cows, goats, and sheep, causing chronic in-

and sec genes. The sed gene was not detected in any of the
isolates. In contrast, the sec gene was the most frequent in
the study of Scherrer et al. (2004). The authors detected this
gene in 123 (64.4%) of 191 S. aureus strains isolated from
milk samples of sheep and goats, followed by seg (16.2%),
sea (14.6%), sej (13.6%), sei (12.6%), seb (2.1%), and sed
(2.1%). In the literature, sea and seg (Scherrer et al., 2004;
Wang et al., 2009) and sec, sed, seg and sei (Zecconi et al.,
2006) are the genes most frequently detected in S. aureus
isolated from animals.

Although the seb gene was the most frequent, it was
not expressed in any of the S. aureus isolates. Only two
(10%) isolates expressed the sec gene and one (5%) the tst
gene. Enterotoxins A and D are the toxins most frequently
implicated in outbreaks of food poisoning (Ertas et al.,
2010). However, the present results demonstrate the impor-
tance of enterotoxin C and TSST-1 in strains isolated from
sheep. Enterotoxin C has been frequently detected in cases
of clinical mastitis in cattle, goats and sheep (Jones and
Wieneke, 1986). In England, Bone et al. (1989) reported
cases of food poisoning caused by the consumption of
sheep milk and cheese. Analysis of the cheese samples
showed the presence of enterotoxins. Further analysis of
milk and cheese samples led the authors to conclude that
food contamination with S. aureus did not occur during
production, but was the result of infection of the milk-
producing animals.

The exotoxin Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)
was detected in only one strain and its expression was con-
firmed. PVL is one of the most important virulence factors
produced by S. aureus, contributing to the pathogenicity of
this microorganism. This toxin is associated with different
diseases in humans, such as pneumonia and necrotizing
dermatitis (Giudice et al., 2009). The luk-PV gene has also
been identified in S. aureus strains isolated from cases of
mastitis (Zecconi et al., 2006; Aires-de-Souza et al., 2007;
Unal et al., 2012). However, this is the first report showing
the expression of this toxin in S. aureus isolated from
sheep.

Among the different S. aureus virulence factors stud-
ied, biofilm formation in isolates obtained from cases of
sheep mastitis is a poorly investigated aspect. The
icaADBC operon is responsible for the synthesis of poly-
saccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), the main component
of the staphylococcal biofilm (Otto, 2008). In the present
study, only one isolate carried the complete icaADBC ope-
ron, whereas other genes of the operon, mainly icaA +
icaD, were detected in most isolates (Table 3). However,
none of the isolates expressed the ica genes detected. The
bap gene encodes a protein that plays an important PIA-
independent role in biofilm formation (Cucarella et al.,
2004). This gene was detected in four strains (Table 4).
However, RT-PCR showed no expression of this gene in
any of the S. aureus isolates. The bap gene is usually not de-
tected and its presence has only been reported in a few S.

aureus strains isolated from cases of bovine subclinical
mastitis (Cucarella et al., 2001). The present results differ
from those reported by Tel et al. (2012) who analyzed 110
S. aureus strains isolated from cases of sheep clinical masti-
tis. The isolates did not carry the bap gene, but were posi-
tive for the icaA and icaD genes. According to Aguilar et al.
(2001), most S. aureus strains isolated from mastitis cases
are surrounded by a biofilm layer that facilitates adhesion
and colonization of the mammary gland epithelium. How-
ever, the 20 isolates from sheep studied here did not express
the genes studied (icaADBC and bap).

Typing of 17 S. aureus strains revealed the presence
of a common clone on the three farms studied. The charac-
terization of the genetic diversity of S. aureus is important
to understand the pattern of dispersion of the pathogen. The
results showed no major heterogeneity among S. aureus
strains, with half the isolates belonging to a single clone.
With respect to the virulence profile of these strains, only
one expressed the sec and tst genes, while the other strains
expressed none of the factors studied. These findings sug-
gest that other virulence factors are related to the capacity
of this clone to spread among flocks and to successfully es-
tablish an infection in the mammary gland of sheep, caus-
ing mastitis. The sec and tst genes are located on a plasmid
and pathogenicity island, respectively, and can be trans-
ferred from one bacterium to another. The presence of these
genes in one strain suggests that this clone, which is able to
spread among the flocks studied, probably acquired these
virulence genes from other staphylococci, rendering it
more virulent.

Conclusion

Most of the S. aureus strains identified were isolated
from cases of subclinical mastitis. Only two isolates did not
cause infection, a finding demonstrating the importance of
S. aureus in the etiology of sheep mastitis. All S. aureus
strains isolated from the three flocks showed high suscepti-
bility to the drugs tested. None of the isolates was a biofilm
producer, indicating that biofilm formation was not a viru-
lence factor causing infection by these strains. However, a
toxigenic potential was demonstrated for some of the iso-
lates, which expressed SEC, TSST-1 and PVL. A clone that
had spread among sheep flocks was identified among the S.
aureus strains isolated from sheep milk. In addition, the
presence and expression of the sec and tst genes in one
strain of this clone suggest the possible acquisition of viru-
lence genes by this clone, a fact that is important for animal
health and food hygiene.
