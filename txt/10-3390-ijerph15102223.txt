Abstract: Background: Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) occasionally threatens the life of the host as a
persistent pathogen even though it is normal ﬂora of humans and animals. We characterized drug
resistance in S. aureus isolated from animal carcasses and milk samples from the abattoirs and dairy
farms in the Eastern Cape Province. Methods: A total of 1000 meat swab samples and 200 raw milk
samples were collected from selected abattoirs and dairy farms. S. aureus was isolated and positively
identiﬁed using biochemical tests and conﬁrmed by molecular methods. An antibiotic susceptibility
test was performed on all isolates for 14 antibiotics and correspondent genes were detected. Results:
Of the 1200 samples collected, 134 (11.2%) samples were positive for S. aureus. Resistance ranged from
71.6% for penicillin G to 39.2% for tetracycline. A resistance gene (blaZ) was detected in 13 (14.9%),
while msrA was found in 31 (52.5%) of S. aureus isolates. Conclusions: The present result shows the
potential dissemination of multidrug-resistant S. aureus strains in the dairy farms and abattoirs in the
Eastern Cape. Therefore, this implies that the organism may rapidly spread through food and pose
serious public health risk.

1. Introduction

Staphylococci asymptomatically colonizes the skin and mucous membranes in the nostrils of
humans and animals [1–5]. This is an important outcome, bearing in mind the fact that nasal carriage
of Staphylococcus aureus has been associated with subsequent infection [5]. Several studies have
reported the identiﬁcation of coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative species in warm-blooded
animals [2,3,6–9]. Carriers are therefore an important source infection spread in communities. S. aureus
(Staphylococcus aureus) causes diseases in humans and animals which include toxic syndrome and
staphylococcal food poisoning (SFP) [10–13]. The work of Hatakka et al. [14] has revealed that S. aureus
in meat is a result of improper hygienic practices during handling by the slaughter personnel during
meat production.

South African studies have reported that a high percentage of the population largely depends
on beef and pork meat as a protein [15,16]. Additionally, some researchers have demonstrated that
infections with antibiotic resistant strains are caused by foods contaminated with antibiotic resistant
bacteria [17–19] making them an ideal vehicle for transmission of antibiotic resistance.

Studies have reported that prolonged use and misuse of antimicrobial agents in agriculture, stock
farming and in treatment of human diseases have resulted in rapid resistance of many bacteria
to several antibiotics of different classes [20–22]. The development of antibiotic resistance has
been observed for a variety of antimicrobial agents which include aminoglycosides, macrolides,
glycopeptides, ﬂuoroquinolones and tetracyclines [23]. Many antibiotic resistance genes play a role
in S. aureus resistance and these include macrolide resistance encoded by the erm gene, aphA3 and
sat genes for kanamycin and streptomycin resistance and accA-aphD and tet genes for gentamicin,
tobramycin and tetracycline resistance [24,25].

There is paucity of information on the molecular characterization of S. aureus in most developing
countries [23,26] especially in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Better understanding of
S. aureus antibiotic susceptibility proﬁles and molecular characterization of genes causing resistance
are of paramount importance for initiating effective control measures and reducing staphylococcal
infections [23,26]. The aim of the study was to identify and characterize antibiotic resistance
susceptibility patterns including antibiotic resistance genes in S. aureus strains isolated from selected
dairy farms and abattoirs in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa.

2. Materials and Methods

A total of two hundred milk samples were collected from cows with subclinical and clinical
mastitis cases over 6 months at Dairy Farm A (100 samples) and Dairy Farm B (100 samples).
Milk samples were collected using the method of Caine et al. [27]. Brieﬂy, in each milking station there
is a small collection bottle with a small hole that is opened and closed using a tap. The bottles were
properly washed and used for sampling another cows’ milk. All the milk samples were stored on ice
and transported to the Biochemistry and Microbiology Laboratory for analysis.

A total of 1000 meat swab samples were collected from cow carcasses, pig carcasses and sheep
carcasses in four selected abattoirs according to the method of Pearce and Bolton [18]. Permission to
collect swab samples was obtained from abattoir managers. Samples were collected from the available
animal carcasses during a period of 10 months (August 2015 to May 2016). Samples were collected
using a sterile swab rinsing kit containing 10 mL isotonic buffer rinse solution, after the gastrointestinal
tract was removed. A 100 cm2 sterile disposable plastic template (Analytical Diagnostics, USA)
was used to mark the area for swabbing. A total of 500 meat swab samples were collected from
cow carcasses, 300 meat swab samples from sheep carcasses and 200 meat swab samples from pig
carcasses. Each animal carcass was sampled in four areas which included rump, ﬂank, brisket, and neck,
and isolates from those four areas were counted consecutively. The meat swab samples were then
stored on ice and transported to the Biochemistry and Microbiology Laboratory for analysis.

2.1. Isolation of S. aureus Milk and Meat Samples

Ten microliters of each milk sample were inoculated onto Baird Parker Agar (Oxoid;
ThermoScientiﬁc, England, UK) and incubated at 37 ◦C for 24–48 h. Meat swab samples were
also inoculated onto the same culture media (in-house method) and incubated for the same period.
Presumptive grey-black colonies surrounded by opaque halo of precipitation on Baird Parker agar
were regarded as presumptive S. aureus isolates and were subjected to biochemical identiﬁcation.

2.2. Biochemical Identiﬁcation and DNA Extraction

Gram-staining, catalase test and oxidase test were performed according to the method of Health
Protection Agency [28–30] for biochemical identiﬁcation of the organism. DNA extraction was
performed based on the procedure of Maugeri et al. [31]. Brieﬂy, a loop full 24-h culture of S. aureus
colonies grown onto Nutrient Agar plates were suspended into 200 µL of sterile nuclease free water and
vortexed for 2 min using MS2 Minishaker (Digisystem Laboratory instruments Inc., New Taipei City,
Taiwan) and the cells were lysed using a heat Dri-Block DB.2A (Technc, Johannesburg, South Africa) for
15 min at 100 ◦C. The pellet was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min using a MiniSpin

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2018, 15, 2223

microcentrifuge (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) kept at 4 ◦C. The supernatant was
transferred in new Eppendorf tubes and used for PCR reactions.

2.3. Bacterial Identiﬁcation

The nuc Gene Ampliﬁcation

The isolates were conﬁrmed by PCR ampliﬁcation of the nuc gene encoding the thermonuclease
enzymes with the oligonucleotide primers shown in Table 1. The total PCR reaction volume of 25 µL
containing 12 µL of master mix (Kapa Biosystems, Johannesburg, South Africa) (containing, DNA Taq
polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl2 and PCR buffer), 5 µL DNA template, 1 µL of the forward and reverse
primers, and 6 µL of nuclease free water was used. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed
using MyCyclerTM (Biorad, Cape Town, South Africa). A total of 35 PCR cycles were run under the
following conditions: DNA denaturation at 94 ◦C for 1 min, primer annealing at 55 ◦C for 0.5 min,
and DNA extension at 72 ◦C for 1.5 min. The ﬁnal cycle was at 72 ◦C for 5 min. The PCR products
were stored at 4 ◦C until they were collected. Amplicons were resolved on 1.5% agarose gel containing
5 µL Ethidium bromide in 1× TAE buffer pH 8.0 for 1 h at 100 V before being visualized and captured
under Alliance 4.7 transilluminator (UVITEC Limited, Cambridge, UK).

2.4. Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing

A disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility test was conducted according to the Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute [32]. Bacterial suspensions were prepared in 2.5 mL of Mueller-Hinton
broth and the turbidity was adjusted to meet 0.5 McFarland turbidity standards (~1.5 × 108 cfu/mL).
The isolates were inoculated onto a Mueller-Hinton Agar plate and tested against a panel of fourteen
antibiotics (Table 2) and results were interpreted according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute [32]. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 was used as a positive control. A dendrogram was
generated by unweighted pairwise grouping with mathematical averaging (UPGMA). Isolates were
considered as belonging to a common cluster when the resistance pattern differed by ≤5 antibiotics.

Detection of Antibiotic Resistance Genes of Staphylococcus aureus

The conﬁrmed S. aureus isolates were screened for antibiotic resistance genes using the
oligonucleotide primers and PCR conditions listed in Table 1. The total reaction volume of 25 µL
containing 12 µL of master mix (Kapa Biosystems, Johannesburg, South Africa) (containing, DNA Taq
polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl2 and PCR buffer), 5 µL DNA template, 1 µL of the forward and reverse
primers (10 ng), and 6 µL of nuclease free water was used for ampliﬁcation. Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) was performed using MyCyclerTM (Biorad, Cape Town, South Africa). The ampliﬁed products
were separated on 1.5% agarose gel containing 5 µL Ethidium bromide in 1× TAE buffer pH 8.0 for
1 h at 100 V before being visualized and photographed under Alliance 4.7 transilluminator (UVITEC
Limited, Cambridge, UK).

3. Results

3.1. Study Population

From 1100 meat and milk samples, a total of 134 samples were positive for S. aureus by culture,
biochemical tests and molecular conﬁrmed by polymerase chain targeting the nuc gene. There were

102/500 (20.4%) isolates from beef samples, 10/300 (3.3%) from sheep samples, 14/100 (14%) from
pork samples were 8/200 (4%) from milk samples. All of the 134 S. aureus revealed a 255 base pair size
in an agarose gel electrophoresis.

3.2. Antimicrobial Resistance Screening of S. aureus Isolates

The resistance proﬁles of isolated S. aureus are shown in Table 2. Sheep and pork isolates were
resistant to one to ﬁve antimicrobial agents. Multidrug resistance (MDR) among all S. aureus isolates
was noted in penicillin G, oxacillin, clindamycin, erythromycin and tetracycline (Table 3).

Table 2 shows Staphylococcus aureus isolates resistant to penicillin G per sampling site. Resistance
from isolates obtained from rump ranged from 40–62.9%, ﬂank ranged from 60–100%, brisket from
50–100% and the neck from 20–100% from pork, sheep and beef isolates. A similar antibiotic resistance
pattern was also observed for oxacillin, where isolates from rump ranged from 40–75%, ﬂank 50–100%,
brisket 50–100%, and neck 20–100% while resistance to tetracycline was observed in isolates from rump
ranging from 40–75%, isolates from ﬂank with percentages ranging from 45–50%, brisket 25–50% and
neck 20–50%.

4. Discussion

Antibiotic use drives the evolution of antibiotic resistance [33]. Our task is to preserve the
effectiveness of existing antibiotics by minimizing the emergence and spread of multidrug resistant
microorganisms to maximize the time until existing antibiotics become ineffective. Over the past years,
the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AR) in bacteria, including staphylococci has increased
and poses public health risks. This is best narrated by the multidrug resistant S. aureus strains that
cause infections that are difﬁcult to treat [38]. In this study the most S. aureus isolates were observed in
beef samples and beef isolates showed resistance to several antibiotics including penicillin G (71.6%),
oxacillin (66.7%), clindamycin (52.9%), erythromycin (48%) and tetracycline (39.2%) respectively. Sheep
and pork samples were relatively resistant to one to ﬁve antimicrobial agents. The work conducted by
Yang et al. [39] has reported similar levels of resistance of S. aureus isolates to penicillin, erythromycin
and tetracycline [40,41]. Andreotti and Nicodeno [42] have revealed that the resistance of S. aureus
to penicillin ranges from 20% to 100%, whilst the percentage of resistance to other antibiotics was
relatively lower. Most of the isolates in our study showed high sensitivity to several antibiotics
including ciproﬂoxacin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, linezolid and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
This implies that such antibiotics can be used to treat infections caused by S. aureus. In our study,
65 different patterns were observed with 5 clusters among which, isolate Dh1-2 and 32C are from two
different abattoirs while M11145 and SME1 were isolated from different farms isolated from milk.
The patterns presented between 2 and 7 isolates. The remaining patterns were represented by single
isolates. However, this is not a true reﬂection of clusters as only one aspect was used and no typing
methods such as Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE), ribotyping and phagotyping were used.

In this study 82 (67%) isolates showed phenotypic resistance to methicillin, however only one
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) gene was detected using molecular methods. All the
other isolates that showed resistance to oxacillin could have a mecC gene, which was not investigated
in our study. Further studies need to be carried out to ascertain the involvement of the mecC gene in
resistance of these isolates to oxacillin. A study performed by Diederen et al. [43] in the Netherlands
has demonstrated that 2.5% of pork and beef samples harbored MRSA isolates. The research performed
by Fessler and co-workers [44] has shown that MRSA were resistant to oxacillin, and 62.5% exhibited
multidrug resistance. Similarly, the study of Hanson et al. [44] advocated that MRSA isolated from
pork, beef, chicken and turkey were resistant to oxacillin and several other antibiotics. There were
87 (69%) S. aureus isolates that were phenotypically resistant to penicillin G and only 13 (14.9%) isolates
were found to express the blaZ gene in this study. Disagreement can occur between phenotypic and
genotypic resistance due to incomplete understanding of the genotypic basis of phenotypic resistance,
ﬂaws with the phenotypic or molecular (e.g., PCR) methods currently used to detect resistance. It may
also be because the phenotypic resistance has been caused by point mutations, bioﬁlm formation or
antibiotic tolerance [36,45]. Different studies demonstrate the presence of other virulence factors that
must be taken in consideration for a comprehensive evaluation of the risk. MRSA and MSSA can
be considered parameters for the valuation of dedicated food chains: Poultry meats [46] and sheep
(ovine food-chain) [47]. Speciﬁc genomic features, as pvl or mecC, were reported recently as emergent
virulence factors in livestock in different papers [48,49].

Of the 82 (67%) S. aureus isolates that were phenotypically resistant to oxacillin, only one isolate
(1.2%) was found to possess the mecA gene. This small proportion of isolates that showed ampliﬁcation
of the mecA gene compared to phenotypic resistance to oxacillin was not surprising. Oxacillin has
been proposed as an alternative antibiotic for testing susceptibility/resistance to methicillin and to all
β-lactams [50]. This could explain why all oxacillin-resistant isolates were not carrying the mecA gene,
because they were showing resistance to β-lactams. Phenotypic resistance witnessed to oxacillin in
this study could have been attained through other mechanisms, including the reduction in membrane
permeability to β-lactam antibiotics.

Binding of tetracycline antibiotics to the 30S ribosomal subunit prevents association of
aminoacyl-tRNA with its acceptor site, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis [51]. S. aureus uses
two mechanisms of tetracycline resistance; active efﬂux via tetA (K) and tetA(L) and ribosomal
protection via tetA(M) [51]. Tetracycline efﬂux in S. aureus strains is mediated by tetA(K), which
is commonly carried by plasmid pT181. Integration of this plasmid into Type III SCCmec makes this
kind of resistance to be named chromosomally encoded resistance. Resistance to tetracycline can also
be mediated by mutations that cause increased expression of various chromosomally encoded efﬂux
pumps, such as Tet38 [52,53]. In this study, a high detection rate was observed in tetM 29 (46.7%) while
tetK detection rate was 26 (41.9%) for tetracycline resistant genes. Seven (11.3%) isolates contained
both tetK and tetM gene.

The erm(C) determinant was found in 2 isolates (3.4%) while no ermA and ermB were detected.
These results are different from the results of Cetin et al. [54] who showed that ermA was the most
prevalent phenotype among S. aureus. Macrolide antibiotic (including azithromycin, clarithromycin,
erythromycin), resistance in S. aureus may be due to an active drug efﬂux mechanism encoded by
msrA and msrB (conferring resistance to macrolides and type B streptogramins). In our study, msrA
determinant was detected in 31 (52.5%) isolates. It is likely that other erythromycin resistance genes
such as msrA, Ere A–B or mef, which we did not include in our study, might be present among these
isolates and account for the remainder of the isolates showing phenotypic resistance to erythromycin.
Aminoglycosides antibiotics play an important role in the treatment of staphylococcal
infections [55]. Aminoglycosides inactivate antibiotics using aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes
(AMEs) that are encoded by genetic elements [56,57]. The aac (6(cid:48))-Ie + aph (2”), ant (4(cid:48))-Ia, aph (3(cid:48))-IIIa,
and ant (6)-Ia genes that encode aminoglycoside-6(cid:48)-N-acetyltransferase/2”-O-phosphoryltransferase,
aminoglycoside-4(cid:48)-O-nucleotidyltransferase I, aminoglyoside-3(cid:48)-O-phosphoryltransferase III, and
streptomycin modifying enzyme, respectively, are the most important genes in this regard. Resistance
to gentamicin, kanamycin, and tobramycin in staphylococci is mediated by a bi-functional enzyme
displaying AAC (6(cid:48)) and APH (2”) activity [58]. In our study, we found 15 S. aureus isolates which were
phenotypically resistant to gentamicin, however, only 5 (33.3%) isolates were found to express one of
these gentamicin resistance genes. Antibiotic resistance can be classiﬁed into three main categories:
Intrinsic, adaptive, and acquired resistance [59]. We speculate that intrinsic antibiotic resistance, being
the naturally low permeability of the bacterial cell wall, which limits uptake of many antibiotics
including aminoglycosides is responsible for the other 10 isolates that did not show amplicons of the
investigated target genes. We did not encounter any organism that was resistant to all tested antibiotics,
implying that other tested antibiotics could still be used to inhibit the growth S. aureus in the from
those four abattoirs and two farms investigated.

Although resistance to antibiotics were present, a characteristic typically reported in pork [18],
the high proportion of multidrug resistance demonstrates how common S. aureus multidrug resistance
is in the studied dairy farms and abattoirs. This development might be linked to numerous factors.
Most dairy farmers in the region are not aware of the risks of S. aureus colonization to milk production
and human health. Hygiene measures were not maintained before and after milking or slaughtering,
which may expedite the presence of S. aureus on the skin of the udder and its access to the mammary
gland and the different sites sampled. The importance of hygiene measures is highlighted in this study.

5. Conclusions

Antibiotic misuse has determined resistance and S. aureus is widely implicated in antibiotic
resistance transfer. However, better supervision and the proper application of hygienic practices in
the transformation of raw materials of animal origin can reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance
S. aureus. The distribution of antibiotic resistance is high in the Eastern Cape Province as compared to
other areas where culling of infected animals is done. Usage of molecules in veterinary medicine and
animal husbandry that are identical as, or closely associated to, antibiotics used in human medicine
should be greatly discouraged.
