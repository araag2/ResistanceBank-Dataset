Quantitative data on Campylobacter contamination of food are lacking, notably in developing countries. We
assessed Campylobacter contamination of chicken neck-skins at points of slaughter in 5 major cities in Africa
(Dakar in Senegal, Yaounde in Cameroon), Oceania (Noumea in New Caledonia), the Indian Ocean (Antananarivo
in Madagascar) and Asia (Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) in Vietnam.
One hundred and ﬁfty slaughtered chickens were collected in each of the 5 major cities from semi-industrial ab-
attoirs or markets (direct slaughter by the seller), and 65.5% (491/750) were found to be Campylobacter-positive.
Two cities, Yaounde and Noumea, demonstrated high prevalence Campylobacter detection rates (92.7% and
96.7% respectively) in contrast with HCMC (15.3%).
Four species were identiﬁed among 633 isolates, namely C. jejuni (48.3%), C. coli (37.3%), C. lari (11.7%) and
C. upsaliensis (1%). HCMC was the only city with C. lari isolation as was Antananarivo for C. upsaliensis. C. coli
was highly prevalent only in Yaounde (69.5%).
Among the 491 samples positive in Campylobacter detection, 329 were also positive with the enumeration meth-
od. The number of Campylobacter colony-forming units (CFU) per gram of neck-skin in samples positive in enu-
meration was high (mean of the log10: 3.2 log10 CFU/g, arithmetic mean: 7900 CFU/g). All the cities showed close
enumeration means except HCMC with a 1.81 log10 CFU/g mean for positive samples. Semi-industrial abattoir
was linked to a signiﬁcant lower count of Campylobacter contamination than direct slaughter by the seller
(p=0.006).
On 546 isolates (546/633, 86.3%) tested for antibiotic susceptibility, resistance to erythromycin, ampicillin and
ciproﬂoxacin was observed for respectively 11%, 19% and 50%. HCMC was the city where antibiotic resistant
rates were the highest (95%, p=0.014).
Considering the 329 positive chickens in Campylobacter enumeration, the mean number of resistant isolates to
at least 2 different antibiotic families (19.8%), may be estimated ca. 1500 CFU/g; the corresponding mean of the
log10 would be 2.5 log10CFU/g.
As chickens are sold at slaughter and brought directly at home to be cooked, these data suggest a high proba-
bility of cross-contamination. A substantial proportion of isolates are drug-resistant, which could lead to poten-
tial public health issues. Health authorities should consider measures to reduce Campylobacter contamination of
chicken during farming and at slaughter, and to provide appropriate food hygiene education. Further studies are
needed in particular to investigate food-handling practices in domestic kitchens.

Campylobacter is an ubiquitous bacterium found in birds, mammals,
insects, farms, production lines and various food items (Humphrey et al.,
2007). The main source of human infection is undercooked chicken, raw

or unpasteurized milk, and cross-contamination from the environment,
notably in kitchens (Friedman et al., 2004; Humphrey et al., 2007). An
estimated 20–40% of human Campylobacter infections are linked to the
handling or consumption of chicken products (EFSA, 2010). The propor-
tion of foodborne illness cases due to cross-contamination is still unclear
(ECDC, 2009; Gorman et al., 2002).

Campylobacter can cause both gastroenteritis and extra-intestinal
disease. C. jejuni and C. coli are the most frequent Campylobacter species
isolated from patients with diarrhea. C. upsaliensis (Lastovica and Le
Roux, 2003; Westgarth et al., 2009) and C. lari may also occasionally
cause diarrhea (Coker et al., 2002; ECDC, 2008). In both industrialized
and developing countries, diarrheal campylobacteriosis is mainly a pe-
diatric disease (b5 years) (Coker et al., 2002; ECDC, 2009; Foodnet,
2010).

Possible interactions between Campylobacter and irritable bowel
diseases (Marshall, 2009) and immunoproliferative small-intestinal
disease (ISID) (Lecuit et al., 2004) need to be conﬁrmed. Intestinal
healthy carriage has also been reported (Lindblom et al., 1995).The
main extraintestinal disease associated with Campylobacter
is
Guillain-Barre-Syndrome, the most frequently diagnosed form of
acute ﬂaccid paralysis worldwide (McGrogan et al., 2009).

Despite its sporadic dissemination (Friedman et al., 2004), non sys-
tematic laboratory diagnosis of diarrhea, and underreporting (ECDC,
2009), Campylobacter has become a more frequently recognized cause
of gastroenteritis than salmonellae (ECDC, 2009). In the European
Union (EU), the incidence is relatively stable, at 45–50 cases per
100 000 inhabitants. In the United States, the incidence of Campylobacter
infection was recently estimated to be 13/100 000 inhabitants (Scallan
et al., 2011), compared to 15/100 000 for Salmonella (Foodnet, 2010).
On the other hand, the incidence of Campylobacter infection in develop-
ing countries is difﬁcult to assess, owing to the absence of speciﬁc na-
tional surveillance programs (Coker et al., 2002).

Worldwide, poultry products are a common and main source of
Campylobacter infection (Humphrey et al., 2007; Jorgensen et al.,
2002). A world literature survey (Suzuki and Yamamoto, 2009) showed
that about 58% of chickens are contaminated by Campylobacter. This
ﬁgure is estimated at 76% in the EU (EFSA, 2010).

Antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens is a worldwide
concern (EFSA, 2011; Hawkey and Jones, 2009), and has been linked
to antibiotic usage in both the clinical setting and in animal husband-
ry (Wright, 2010). Human Campylobacter infection is treated when
necessary, with macrolides or ﬂuoroquinolones (Coker et al., 2002),
but the use of these drugs in poultry production is contributing to
an increasing prevalence of resistance (Alfredson and Korolik,
2007). Ciproﬂoxacin resistance rates above 50% have been reported
in Campylobacter isolates from poultry products worldwide (Cokal
et al., 2009; de Jong et al., 2009; EFSA, 2011; Habib et al., 2009; Oporto
et al., 2009).

The quantitative risk assessment approach is recommended by
international organizations such as the World Trade Organization
(WTO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and
Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Codex
Alimentarius (Codex Alimentarius Commission, 2003), as a tool to sup-
port risk management and to harmonize international trade in foods
(Nauta et al., 2009). Quantitative exposure assessment is generally
based on mathematical models simulating changes in the frequency
and level of contamination of a given food item, from a given starting
point up to consumption (Nauta et al., 2009). Enumeration data has
been highlighted as a major hindrance to meaningful risk assessment
in developing countries, notably in Africa and Asia (FAO/WHO, 2001,
2002).

The present study was designed to determine the frequency and
quantiﬁcation of Campylobacter contamination of broilers, and the an-
tibiotic susceptibility of isolates, at ﬁve cities covered by the Food and
Environment Study Group of the International Network of Pasteur
Institutes (INPI).

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sample collection

This study was conducted between late 2005 and 2006 in Africa
(Dakar in Senegal, Yaounde in Cameroon), Oceania (Noumea in New
Caledonia), the Indian Ocean (Antananarivo in Madagascar) and Asia
(Ho Chi Minh City [HCMC] in Vietnam). Senegal is a West African coun-
try with a Saharan climate. Dakar is its capital city, with 2 million inhab-
itants. It is a harbor located on the Atlantic Ocean coast. Yaounde, the
city with 7 hills, is the capital city of Cameroon in Central Africa. It is a
large urban area with 2 million inhabitants. Its climate is tropical. New
Caledonia is a French territory located in the Paciﬁc Ocean, North-East
of Australia, with 300 000 inhabitants. Its capital city is Noumea.
Antananarivo at an altitude of 1500 m with 2 million inhabitants is
the capital of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, separated from Africa
by the Mozambican channel. Ho Chi Minh, on the Saigon River is the
biggest city in Vietnam, with 7.3 million inhabitants and plays a role
of economical leadership in the country.

In each city, points of direct slaughter by the seller and semi-industrial
abattoirs were identiﬁed. A random sample of these points of slaughter
was selected and their chicken production estimated. The number of
chickens sampled per point of slaughter was proportional to the level
of production, leading to a self-weighted sampling. Three chickens per
week were studied in each of these cities over a one-year period until
one hundred and ﬁfty chickens were sampled in ﬁnal. The points of
slaughter were classiﬁed as “semi-industrial abattoirs” or “direct slaugh-
ter by the seller”. Semi-industrial abattoirs were characterized by an au-
tomated production chain (slaughter, scalding, plucking, evisceration)
with manual carving. Direct slaughter by the seller consisted in an all-
in-one manual process carried out at the sell-off in markets. A question-
naire was conducted about the environmental conditions of slaughter.

Slaughtered chickens were transported in less than 3 h to the

laboratory under less than 8 °C cooled atmosphere.

2.2. Laboratory investigations

Campylobacter detection and enumeration were carried out with 10 g
of neck-skin from each broiler carcass, according to International Stan-
dard Organization (ISO) norms (6887–1, 1999; 6887–2, 2004; 10272–1,
2006; 10272–2, 2006). Campylobacter was detected after an enrichment
step in Preston broth at 37 °C for 4 to 6 h followed by 44 to 48 h at
41.5 °C in microaerobic conditions. Karmali and charcoal-cefoperazone-
desoxycholate-agar (CCDA, Oxoid) solid media were streaked with the
incubated broth and the plates were then incubated at 41.5 °C for 44 to
48 h in microaerobic conditions. Campylobacter enumeration was done
in all samples. Brieﬂy, 0.1 ml of 10−1 and 10−2 neck-skin grind dilutions
were streaked on CCDA agar, without an enrichment step and incubated
for 44 to 48 h at 41.5 °C. Presumptive Campylobacter colonies (between 1
and 5, as speciﬁed in the ISO standard) obtained through both methods
(detection and enumeration) were subcultured on blood agar and
identiﬁed by microscopic examination, Gram staining, and biochemical
tests (oxidase and catalase production, sensitivity to nalidixic acid and
cephalothin, hippurate hydrolysis, and growth at 25 °C). Campylobacter
susceptibility testing was done by disc diffusion method on colonies re-
covered after enrichment step and followed the recommendations of
the French Comité de l'Antibiogramme de la Société de Microbiologie
(CASFM). Six antimicrobials disks (Biorad laboratories) were tested: am-
picillin (10 μg), cephalothin (30 μg), gentamicin (15 μg), erythromycin
(15 UI), nalidixic acid (30 μg) and ciproﬂoxacin (5 μg). Escherichia coli
ATCC 25922 was used for susceptibility testing quality control.

2.3. Statistical analysis

On a given sample, distinct isolates were deﬁned as isolates belong-
ing to different species or with different antibiotic susceptibilities. Data

were collected in a speciﬁcally designed Microsoft Access database
(Microsoft Corp, Redmond, USA) and were analyzed with Microsoft
Excel (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, USA) and R software (v.2.11.1, The R
Core Team, Vienna). Proportions were compared using Fisher's exact
test, and CFU data were compared by using the non parametric
Kruskal–Wallis test.

3. Results

3.1. Points of slaughter

Slaughtered chickens were collected from 82 points of slaughter, 77
(93.9%) of which were classiﬁed as “direct slaughter by the seller”, and 5
(6.1%) as “Semi-industrial abattoirs” (present in Noumea, HCMC and
Antananarivo only). Amongst the 750 chickens sampled, 455 (60.7%)
were slaughtered by the seller, and 295 (39.3%) in semi-industrial
abattoirs.

Two cities, Dakar and Yaounde, had predominant direct slaughter by
the seller, 95% and 93%, respectively. Noumea was almost exclusively
using semi-industrial abattoirs (97%). The two other cities showed
more balanced types of points of slaughter, 60% direct slaughter by
the seller in HCMC and 59% semi-industrial abattoirs in Antananarivo.

3.2. Prevalence rates

The prevalence of Campylobacter carriage was 65.5% (491/750)
overall, and ranged from 15.3% in HCMC to 96.7% in Noumea
(Table 1). A total of 633 distinct isolates were recovered from the
491 positive chickens. C. jejuni (56.6% of positive chickens and 48.3%
of all the isolates) was slightly more frequent than C. coli (44.6% of
positive chickens and 37.3% of all the isolates) (Table 1). C. coli was
predominant only in Yaounde (69.5%). As expected, C. lari was far
less prevalent (4.3% of chickens) as was C. upsaliensis (1.2% of
chickens). These latter two species were found at only two of the
ﬁve cities (HCMC and Antananarivo). Surprisingly, C. lari was the
main species identiﬁed in HCMC (76.1% of isolates). Two different spe-
cies were found on 18.5% (66/357) of positive chickens from which
multiple colonies (up to 5) underwent species identiﬁcation, and at

least two distinct isolates were detected on 20.7% (74/357) of the
same chickens.

3.3. Enumeration

Campylobacter was never detected by the enumeration method
when the detection method was negative. The enumeration method
was positive (≥1 conﬁrmed colony on the two enumeration plates)
for 43.9% of chickens (329/750) overall, and for 67% of the 491
chickens positive in the detection method. The mean of the log10
transformed number of Campylobacter colony-forming units (CFU)
per gram of neck-skin, was 3.2 for samples positive in enumeration.
All the cities had close mean values except HCMC. The arithmetic
mean on positive samples was 7864 CFU/g. Most positive chickens
had values of 2–4 log10 CFU/g (79%, 260/329), while 14% (46/329)
were above 4 log10 CFU/g (Table 2). Thirty out of the 46 chickens
(65.2%) with more than 4 log10 CFU/g were from Yaounde. Yaounde
was the city where the mean log10 CFU/g of Campylobacter contami-
nation was the highest (3.5) but high rates of maximum log10 Cam-
pylobacter enumeration were also detected in Noumea (5.2) and
Antananarivo (5.4) (Table 2). Both the prevalence and level of Cam-
pylobacter contamination were low in HCMC (mean 1.81 log10 CFU/g
for positive samples).

When all the cities were considered together, counts were higher
after direct slaughter by the seller than after slaughter in semi-
industrial abattoirs (Kruskal–Wallis test, p=0.006). Considering the cit-
ies individually, however, the difference was never signiﬁcant.

3.4. Antibiotic susceptibility

Five hundred and forty six (86.3%%) of the 633 isolates were tested
for antimicrobial susceptibility, comprising 290 C. jejuni (53.1%), 229
C. coli (41.9%), 21 C. lari (3.9%) and 6 C. upsaliensis (1.1%) (Table 3).
Overall, 11% of tested isolates were resistant to erythromycin, 19% to
ampicillin and 52.1% to all quinolones tested.

Marked differences in antimicrobial resistance were observed across
the cities. HCMC was the city with the highest rate of resistant isolates
(p=0.014), with 25% of isolates resistant to erythromycin, 40% to
ampicillin and 95% to quinolones. Ciproﬂoxacin resistance was most

to erythromycin, ampicillin and
C.
quinolones in 28.6%, 47.6% and 100% of cases, respectively. C. upsaliensis
was mainly resistant to ampicillin (83.3%) and erythromycin (100%).
Overall, among the 546 isolates tested, 33% (180/546) were susceptible
to all the antibiotics tested, 47.2% (258/546) resistant to one group of
antibiotics, 17.4% (95/546) to two groups, and 2.4% (13/546) to three
groups. Considering the 329 positive chickens in Campylobacter enu-
meration, and assuming independence between the level of bacteria
and the antibiotic resistance, the mean number of resistant isolates to
at least 2 different antibiotic families (19.8%), may be estimated ca.
1500 CFU/g. The corresponding mean of the log10 would be estimated
2.5 log10 cfu/g.

4. Discussion

Campylobacter contamination rates vary widely among countries. In
a study of 26 European Union member states, the chicken carcass con-
tamination rate was 75.8% on average, but ranged from 4.9% to 100%
(EFSA, 2010). Similarly, a literature survey (Suzuki and Yamamoto,
2009) referencing 73 publications worldwide on retail poultry meat
showed a mean contamination rate of 58% and a range of 8% to 100%.

Our results are compatible with the literature, showing a mean contam-
ination rate of 65.5% and city-to-city variations from 15.3% to 96.7%. In
Senegal, a study conducted in 2000–2001 on fresh droppings of broiler
ﬂocks in farms showed a Campylobacter prevalence of 63% (Cardinale et
al., 2004), a rate slightly higher than what we found in Dakar (49%). In
Vietnam, in 2004, 28.3% of raw poultry and 31% of breast ﬁllets were
found to be contaminated with Campylobacter (Ha and Pham, 2006;
Luu et al., 2006), compared to 15% for neck-skin in our study. In Cambo-
dia, a neighboring country, 80.9% of chicken neck-skin samples were
reported to be Campylobacter‐positive at slaughter (Kruy et al., 2011).
In our study, automated slaughter processing lines (semi-industrial
abattoirs) did not guarantee a lower prevalence of Campylobacter detec-
tion than manual slaughter (direct slaughter by the seller) even though
contamination level was globally lower (p=0.006). For instance, while
the production chain is mainly automated in Noumea and the whole
process is manual in Yaounde, we found similar neck-skin contamina-
tion rates (96.7% in Noumea and 92.7% in Yaounde). The high prevalence
rates in automated settings could be explained by contamination of the
production line by Campylobacter-positive broiler ﬂocks (Figueroa et al.,
2009; Johannessen et al., 2007).

Campylobacter detection at the species level is more questionable for
C. lari and C. upsaliensis than for the two usual species C. jejuni and C. coli.
Selective media and incubation temperatures are more efﬁcient for iso-
lating the two latter species, but PCR techniques have improved species
identiﬁcation (Tazumi et al., 2009). The species distribution found in
this study was in keeping with previous data, C. jejuni being predomi-
nant (56.6%), followed by C. coli (44.6%) and other Campylobacter spe-
cies (6.1%) (EFSA, 2010; Jorgensen et al., 2002). Interestingly, C. coli
was three times as frequent as C. jejuni in Yaounde, as is the case in
some European countries (Ireland, Italy and Spain) (EFSA, 2010).
C. upsaliensis is not frequent poultry contaminant, as its main reservoir
is pets (Damborg et al., 2008), as well as C. lari which reservoir is how-
ever much wider, wild birds, geese, ducks, sheep, pigs, dogs, cats and
water (Matsuda and Moore, 2011). Surprisingly, despite the absence
of all these animal species around the points of slaughter in HCMC,
C. lari was the prevalent species (73.9%). In Phnom Penh (Cambodia),
21% of isolates from neck-skin samples were C. lari (Kruy et al., 2011).
In the 2010 EFSA report (EFSA, 2010), C. lari accounted for 0.2% of
batches with species identiﬁcation underlining the speciﬁc situation
seen in HCMC. In Vietnam, previous studies on children bacterial diar-
rhea (Hien et al., 2007; Isenbarger et al., 2001) did not observe C. lari
as a predominant pathogen even though in Hanoi, 29% of Campylobacter
isolates on chicken meat were of “unknown” species (Luu et al., 2006).
These ﬁndings would have to be conﬁrmed by further studies and po-
tential risk factors investigated. In Antananarivo, C. upsaliensis was iso-
lated from 5.5% of samples. From data collected by questioning, the
presence of dogs was recorded at 37% (10/27) of the slaughter sites,
raising again questions as to their involvement in poultry contamina-
tion (Westgarth et al., 2009). We observed simultaneous carriage of

two different species more frequently than in other studies (Jorgensen
et al., 2002; Manfreda et al., 2006). This may have implications for the
estimated species distribution if speciation is based on a single colony.
In particular, co-contamination by C. jejuni and C. coli may be more fre-
quent than generally reported, and our ﬁndings suggest that more than
one colony should be used for speciation.

We found that a smaller number of chickens were positive by enu-
meration than by simple detection (43.9% vs 65.5%). This difference
was due to a level of Campylobacter contamination below the detection
limit of the method used. However, it is difﬁcult to compare results
across studies, owing to the use of different materials and enumeration
methods (Scherer et al., 2006). In the 2010 EFSA report (EFSA, 2010),
Campylobacter counts between 2 and 6 log10 CFU/g were less frequent
on broiler neck-skins (40.9%) than in our study (79%, 260/329). There-
fore, compared to a similar study conducted in Phnom Penh in Cambo-
dia, (Kruy et al., 2011), where 54.6% of chickens had Campylobacter
counts between 4 and 6 log10 CFU/g, the lower proportion of samples
with this range of contamination in our study (14%, 46/329), suggests
a lower probability of cross-contamination. The mean of the log10-
transformed data obtained in our study (3.2 log10 CFU/g), was between
that obtained in a study of raw retail chicken leg-skins in Berlin (2.6
log10 CFU/g) (Scherer et al., 2006), and the one observed in a study
conducted in England between 1998 and 2000 on neck-skin of raw
chickens from retail outlets (4.1 log10 CFU/g) (Jorgensen et al., 2002).
The type of slaughter point did not signiﬁcantly impact the prevalence
of contamination at a given city in our study but inﬂuenced the abun-
dance of Campylobacter contamination. Semi-industrial abattoirs were
associated with contamination rates similar to direct slaughter by the
seller, but CFU counts were lower. This could be due to contamination
of chickens previously free of Campylobacter on the production line
(Figueroa et al., 2009; Johannessen et al., 2007).

Antimicrobial resistance rates also varied according to the city. High
levels of ciproﬂoxacin resistance were observed (39% to 95%), except in
Antananarivo (5.5%), with an overall mean of 50%. Ciproﬂoxacin resis-
tance has already been reported worldwide, especially in poultry ﬂocks
in the Basque region of Spain (57.9%) (Oporto et al., 2009), chicken
meat in Belgium (53.1%) (Habib et al., 2009), chicken intestinal samples
collected in the EU (C. jejuni in 36.6% and C. coli in 60.2%) (de Jong et al.,
2009) and cecal samples from broiler chickens in Turkey (74.2% of
C. jejuni and 65.5% of C. coli were ciproﬂoxacin-resistant) (Cokal et al.,
2009). In Phnom-Penh (Cambodia), resistance to ciproﬂoxacin was
25.9% (Kruy et al., 2011). In Senegal, our results are similar to those pub-
lished in 2003, with 34% of ciproﬂoxacin-resistant C. jejuni and C. coli
isolates (Cardinale et al., 2003). In this study, C. coli was more resistant
to ciproﬂoxacin than C. jejuni (60.7% vs 39%, p b0.0001) and this has
been previously reported (EFSA, 2011; Gallay et al., 2007). But, as gen-
erally observed (ECDC, 2008; Luangtongkum et al., 2009), C. coli was
not more frequently resistant to erythromycin or ampicillin than
C. jejuni. C. upsaliensis was more resistant to antibiotics than the other
Campylobacter species isolated in Antananarivo, except for quinolones
and this contrasts with the low level of antibiotic resistance found in
Antananarivo. C. lari was the species most frequently resistant to cipro-
ﬂoxacin in our study (100%), while a rate of 63.3% has been reported in
Phnom Penh (Kruy et al., 2011).

Considering the 329 chickens positive in enumeration test and the
percentage of isolates resistant to more than two different antibiotic
families (19.8%), assuming an independence between the level of bacte-
ria and the antibiotic resistance , it results a ca. 1500 CFU/g average of
resistant isolates born by these chickens. Very few articles on quantita-
tive food contamination have mentioned such data and thereby, it is dif-
ﬁcult to compare our ﬁndings across other studies (Jorgensen et al.,
2002). However, antimicrobial resistances among zoonotic bacteria is
considered by food safety authorities as of major concern and national
surveillance systems aimed at collecting these data, have been recently
implemented in developed countries (EFSA, 2011; Lahuerta et al.,
2011).

In developing countries, as chickens are sold to consumers directly
after slaughter, contamination will have direct implications for cross-
contamination in domestic kitchens. Food-handling practices in pri-
vate kitchens should be further studied in order to better understand
mishandling and cross-contamination behaviors. Efforts to reduce
Campylobacter contamination and to improve food hygiene must
focus on farms, slaughterhouses, points of direct slaughter, and pri-
vate kitchens.
