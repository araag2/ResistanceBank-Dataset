The emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial re-
sistance in bacteria derived from food-producing animals
is a consequence of intensive agricultural and veterinary
use  of  antimicrobial  compounds.  The  inappropriate  use
and  prescribing  of  antibiotics,  along  with  their  use  as
growth promoters, is the main cause of the development
of resistance. The potential risk of the transfer of this re-
sistance  through  the  food  chain  by  bacteria  such  as Es-
cherichia coli (E. coli), including food borne pathogens
such as Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, implies a problem
for public health (van den Bogaard and Stobberingh, 2000).
Horizontal gene transfer is an important route of the dis-
semination.  Integrons  are  genetic  elements  able  to  cap-
ture gene cassettes encoding antibiotic resistance from the
environment and incorporate them by site-specific recom-
bination. Integrons are gene-capture and expression sys-
tems characterized by the presence of an intI gene encod-
ing  an  integrase,  a  recombination  site  (attI),  and  a  pro-
moter. The most frequently reported mobile integrons are
class 1 and class 2 integrons, which have been shown to
contribute to the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes.
It is important to remark that the presence of integrase is
potentially indicative of strains capable of recruiting anti-
biotic resistance genes (Cambray et al., 2010). Moreover,
resistance genes and resistant bacteria in the environment
are considered an ecological problem. Therefore, the in-

vestigation of commensal bacteria is important in order to
assess the extent of the drug resistance problem. The aim
of the present study was to evaluate the susceptibility to
antibiotics in commensal integron-positive E. coli isolated
from pigs from a pig farm in Argentina.

Samples were taken from a commercial farm in Buenos
Aires Province, Argentina, between March and June 2012.
The use of antibiotics on the farm was considered moder-
ate because subtherapeutic feed-based antibiotics were not
used, and only therapeutic concentrations of tetracyclines
were used for short periods during disease outbreaks. In
addition,  injectable  antibiotics  (fosfomycin,  tiamulin,
amoxicillin) were not used except for brief periods to con-
trol atypical disease outbreaks (less than 15 days per year).
Briefly, one sow was randomly selected and fecal mate-
rial  was  collected  via  a  rectal  swab  at  3  h  postpartum.
Swabs were also obtained from five randomly chosen pig-
lets  from  the  test  sow  on  the  same  day. The  piglets  se-
lected were sampled again at day 21 and at day 70. These
ages correspond to phases in which the pigs were housed
in the farrowing crate (F), weaning (W), and growing/fin-
ishing units (G/F), respectively. Fecal samples were grown
in 20 ml of LB for 24 h at 37°C, with shaking. Then 10 µl
were plated on MacConkey agar and incubated for 18 h at
37°C. From each plate, suspected E. coli isolates (5–7 per
plate)  were  randomly  selected  and  were  cultured  in  0.8

ml of LB for 24 h at 37°C, with shaking for DNA extrac-
tion. E. coli gene universal stress protein (uspA) was used
to confirm E. coli (Chen and Griffiths, 1998). Virulence
genes  stx1,  stx2,  stx2e,  eae,  lt,  sta,  stb  characteristic  of
verotoxigenic  E.  coli  (VTEC),  enteropathogenic  E.  coli
(EPEC) and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), respectively,
were detected by PCR (Parma et al., 2000). Genes encod-
ing integrase 1 (Int1) and integrase 2 (Int2) were detected
to  identify  the  presence  of  integrons  class  1  or  class  2,
respectively (de la Torre et al., 2014). Only negative strains
for these genes have been considered as commensal and
integron positive strains have been included in this study.
The susceptibility of isolates to different antibiotics was
tested  by  the  Kirby  Bauer  disk  diffusion  method  using
Muller Hinton Agar against selected antibiotics, namely
amoxicillin  (AMX;  10  µg),  tetracycline  (TET;  30  µg),
fosfomycin (FOSF; 200 µg), tiamulin (TIA; 30 µg), colis-
tin (COL; 10 µg), enrofloxacin (ENR; 5 µg), florfenicol
(FLOR; 30 µg). The inhibition zone size was interpreted
by  using  the  standard  recommendation  of  the  Clinical
Laboratory Standards Institute (2010). An isolate was con-
sidered to be multidrug resistant if it was resistant to more
than 2 groups of antibiotics.

For confirmation of the organization of resistance gene
cassettes in class 1 integrons, PCRs for variable regions
were  carried  out  using  the  following  primers:  5′CS:  5′-
GCCATCCAAGCAGCAAG,  3′CS:  5′-AAGCAGACT-
TGACCTGA.  Some  amplicons  were  sequenced  and/or
subjected to restriction endonuclease digestion with BtsI
or PvuI when the sizes of PCR products were identical.
The organization of resistance genes in class 2 integrons
was mapped by two specific PCRs. The primer sequences
were: intI2F: 5′-TTATTGCTGGGATTAGGC, Sat1R: 5′-
GTTTCGTTCGAGACTTGAGG  and  Sat1F:  5′-CTA-
TCTACCAGAAGTGTGAGC,  aad1R:  5′-AAGAA-
TGTCATTGCGCTGCC.  In  addition,  some  amplicons
were also sequenced. The resulting DNA sequences were
compared with the sequences in the current GenBank da-
tabase using an updated version of the BLAST program
available at the National Center for Biotechnology Infor-
mation  website  (www.ncbi.nih.gov)  and  in  the
INTEGRALL database (http://integrall.bio.ua.pt/).

All commensals E. coli carrying integrons isolated from
the selected sow (n = 11) showed some antibiotic resist-
ance  (Table  1).  Furthermore,  most  of  the  isolates  (8/11,
72.7%) were resistant to one or two antibiotics of which

272

DE LA TORRE et al.

the majority carried class 2 integrons (Table 1). These re-
sults are in agreement with Literak et al. (2009) who dem-
onstrated that sows that contained E. coli resistant to two
antibiotics carried mainly class 2 integrons. From isolates
recovered  from  piglets  (n  =  77),  49.4%  of  resistant
commensal strains carried class 1 integrons while 42.9%
carried class 2 integrons and 7.7% carried both classes of
integrons (Table 1). Unlike isolates obtained from sows,
those  obtained  from  piglets  were  mostly  multiresistant
(88.3%): 51.5% harbored class 1 integrons, 39.7% class 2
integrons and 8.8% carried both classes of integrons (Ta-
ble 1). However, several studies have demonstrated a broad
distribution of multiresistant isolates recovered from pro-
duction  animals  and  humans  (Lanz  et  al.,  2003;
Phongpaichit et al., 2007) and a high prevalence of E. coli
carried class 1 integrons (Phongpaichit et al., 2007).

Isolates from sows were resistant to more than 2 antibi-
otics  (27.3%),  while  isolates  from  farrowing  piglets
showed 72% (18/25) multiresistant strains. This propor-
tion  increased  at  the  last  stages  of  production:  weaning
100% (14/14) and growth/fattening 94.7% (36/38). In ad-
dition, we note that these multiresistant strains are mainly
class 1 integron-positive (Table 1). Considering these re-
sults, it is important to note that multiresistant E. coli iso-
lates are found in piglets less than 12 hours of age, high-
lighting the importance of transmission of these strains to
the litter at birth when microbiota implantation takes place.
Mathew  et  al.  (1999)  detected  higher  levels  of  multire-
sistant  E.  coli  obtained  from  piglets  more  than  35  days
old compared with those 7 days old and with sows. Simi-
larly,  Mazurek  et  al.  (2013)  found  higher  multidrug  re-
sistance in piglets compared with sows as a consequence
of antibiotic supply in the post-weaning period. Andraud
et  al.  (2011)  observed  that  the  transmission  of  resistant
bacterial strains between individuals is a factor that ena-
bles their persistence in pig farms. While most studies do
not consider the age of the animals, our data indicate that
age is an important factor affecting resistance in swine. It
must be kept in mind that, at weaning, the liquid or/and
semiliquid  diet  becomes  dry  food. Thus,  the  piglets  are
exposed to antibiotics used in the food as growth promo-
tion in some countries (Barton, 2014).

The highest resistance rates were found for tetracycline
(96.6%) and tiamulin (94.1%), followed by enrofloxacin
(68.2%),  florfenicol  (60.2%),  amoxicillin  (52.3%)  and
fosfomycin (40.9%). There was no strain resistant for col-
istin, but disk diffusion test is not the best test to evaluate
colistin resistance (Morales et al., 2012). E. coli strains
resistant to four and five antibiotics simultaneously were
the most prevalent (27.3% and 28.4%, respectively) (Ta-
ble 2). Values obtained in this work agree with other au-
thors  whose  studies  were  performed  with  isolates  from
countries where the surveillance programs have not been
settled and antibiotic use is not properly regulated (Literak
et al., 2009; Marchant and Moreno, 2013). The most fre-
quent multiresistance profiles observed were TET-ENR-
AMX-FLOR-FOSF (22.7%), TET-TIA-ENR (13.6%) and
TET-ENR-AMX-FLOR  (12.5%)  (Table  2).  Overall,  in
veterinary science, E. coli isolates were resistant to five
or more antibiotics (Goldstein et al., 2001). Nevertheless,
comparison among them should be carefully analyzed be-

cause of the different bacterial selection criteria used in
these studies.

Eight  E.  coli  strains  harboring  class  1  integrons  were
randomly selected to characterize the variable region by
the digestion of PCR products and sequencing. The vari-
able  regions  of  5  strains  contained  one  gene  cassette,
aadA1, encoding an aminoglycoside-adenyltransferase that
confers resistance to streptomycin and spectinomycin. The
aadA1 genes present more than a 99% identity with the
reference  aadA1  (GenBank  accession  No.  X12870).  In
these genes, two substitutions could be observed: an ad-
enine to guanine transition at base 602 (leading to a lysine
to arginine amino acid change at position 201) and a cyto-
sine to thymine transition at base 750 (silent mutation).

It has been shown that gene cassettes belonging to the
aadA  family  were  mainly  found  in  class  1  integrons  in
commensal bacteria isolated from farm and nonfarm en-
vironments (Yang et al., 2010).

Furthermore, 3 strains did not carry gene cassettes—the
so-called  empty  integrons.  This  situation  has  also  been
described by other authors (Lee et al., 2006), pointing out
that these bacteria could have the potential in the future to
convert themselves rapidly into multiresistant strains. In
this  regard,  Rosser  and  Young  (1999)  proposed  that
“empty” integrons represent ancestral elements that have
not yet acquired gene cassettes inserted between the con-
served segments of the integrons.

Likewise, sixteen commensal isolates carrying integrons
class 2 were studied. The arrangement of gene cassettes
dhfrI-sat-aadA1 was found within these integrons, which
is typically associated in Tn7-like class 2 integrons (ac-
cession number NC_002525).

Herein, in the class 2 integrons, the dhfrI gene, which
confers resistance to trimethoprim, has always been asso-
ciated with the genes aadA1 and sat. Both of these genes
confer resistance to aminoglucosides, and the sat gene in
particular confers resistance to streptothricin, a much used
antibiotic  in  the  food  industry  and  veterinary  treatment
(Lee et al., 2006).

In one isolate, which contained both integrons, the pres-
ence of the same two gene cassettes arrangements were
observed: aadA1 (in class 1 integron) and dhfrI-sat-aadA1
(in class 2 integron). Kang et al. (2005) indicated that the
predominance  of  the  aadA1  cassette  suggests  that  this
could  be  the  first  to  be  acquired  by  an  integron  and/or
could be more stable than the other genetic cassettes. On
the other hand, the high predominance of this gene could
be related to the extensive use of these aminoglucosides
in the control of infectious diseases in these food-produc-
ing animals.

The selected antibiotics are used on farms to achieve a
high birth rate and to maximize productive performance
in terms of average daily gains and feed efficiency at less
cost. Moreover, antibiotics are used with therapeutic pur-
poses, with medicated feeds being the most common mode
of administration of the drug (Barton, 2014). Antibacte-
rial  growth  promoters  belonging  to  different  groups  of
antibiotics structurally unrelated exert their antibacterial
activity by several mechanisms. We include the most im-
portant groups of antibiotics such as beta-lactams (AMX),
tetracyclines (TET), quinolones (ENR), epoxides (FOSF),

(FLOR),  pleuromutilin 

phenicoles 
(TIA)  and
glycopeptides (COL) which have been used for this pur-
pose (Cromwell, 2002).

There is growing evidence that the environment plays a
role  in  the  spread  of  antibiotic  resistance  among  patho-
genic species. Many questions have been raised concern-
ing the impact of the release of antibiotics and antibiotic-
resistant bacteria on the environment or over human and
animal health. The use of antimicrobial agents could se-
lect  resistant  bacteria  nonpathogenic,  e.g.  those  that  re-
cruit resistant determinants mediated by integrons, which
later  may  transfer  the  acquired  resistance  to  different
pathogenic  bacteria  species  (van  den  Bogaard  and
Stobberingh, 2000) by horizontal gene transfer. Keeping
this  in  mind,  we  managed  to  obtain  resistant
transconjugants, indicating the ability of the mobile ge-
netic  element  bearing  integron  to  be  transferred  from
commensal  microflora  to  potential  zoonotic  pathogens
(data not shown).

The abundance of commensal E. coli harboring integrons
and resistance levels reported in this study is alarming and
clearly  indicates  that  unmonitored  use  of  antibiotics  on
swine farms could expand the abundance of the antibiotic
resistance  reservoir  in  the  farm  environment. Antibiotic
resistance in bacteria associated with pigs not only affects
pig production but also has an impact on the environment,
by  contamination  soil  and  water,  and  on  human  health
through the transfer of resistant organisms and associated
genes via the food chain and/or direct contact of farm per-
sonnel and workers in the food industries.
