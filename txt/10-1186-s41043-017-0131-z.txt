Detection and identification of
antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella in raw
beef at Wolaita Sodo municipal abattoir,
Southern Ethiopia
Wondimu Wabeto1, Yishak Abraham2 and Antehun Alemayehu Anjulo2*

Abstract
Background: The consumption of multidrug resistant Salmonella isolates along with a raw meat dish is directly
relevant to the global public health crisis of antimicrobial resistance. All countries around the globe are suffering
from food-borne diseases. In developing countries, more than one billion individuals suffering from gastroenteritis
and around five million infected individuals die annually.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out from December 2015 to May 2016 to show the risk of Salmonella
associated with consuming traditional raw meat dishes and to characterize the antimicrobial resistance profile at
Wolaita Sodo municipal abattoir. Animals were being processed as part of the normal work of the abattoir, and
448 carcass samples were taken after getting a written consent from the municipality. Samples were transported
to Wolaita Sodo University Microbiology Laboratory in an ice box within an hour of collection. Swab samples were
pre-enriched in tetrathionate broth and Rappaport-Vassiliadis R10 broth. Broth culture was sub-cultured on xylose
lysine deoxycholate and brilliant green agar and incubated at a temperature of 37 °C for overnight. Antimicrobial
susceptibility test was done by disk diffusion method. Microbiological and observational data entry and analysis
were done using Microsoft Excel 2007.
Results: From the total 448 sampled carcasses, Salmonella growth was observed in 56 (12.5%) samples.
The isolates had various resistance profiles, with resistance to 1 to 12 antimicrobial drugs. Tetracycline- and
nitrofurantion-resistant isolates were frequent, 83.93 and 73.21% respectively, and followed by streptomycin-
resistant isolates (66%). Ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates were rare (7%).
Conclusion: Salmonella species contamination frequency was high in raw beef, and most of the isolates exhibited
resistance to commonly used antibiotics. People living in the town and consuming the raw meat are at risk for
developing diseases, and attention should be given to select antimicrobials in treating Salmonella infections in both
animals and human being based on antimicrobial susceptibility test. Moreover, intersectoral working and developing
one health approach is essential. Health information should be given to individuals who have the habit of eating raw
meat. Training on sanitary and hygiene practice should be given to the abattoir workers.

Background
consumption of multidrug-resistant Salmonella
The
isolates along with a raw meat dish is directly relevant to
the global public health crisis of antimicrobial resistance.
Food-borne diseases caused by non-typhoid salmonella
still remains as a public health challenge. All countries
around the globe are suffering from food-borne disease
outbreaks. The problem is more serious in developing
countries; more than one billion cases of gastroenteritis
and five million individuals die annually [1].

Poor food handling and sanitation practices, inadequate
food safety laws, weak regulatory systems, lack of financial
resources, and awareness about proper food handling cre-
ate a conducive environment for the spread of food-borne
and food poisoning etiologic agents in Ethiopia [2].
According to Minister of Health (MoH) report, 60% of the
disease burden in Ethiopia was related to poor hygiene
and sanitation [3]. Factors that contribute for the emerging
of
food-borne disease outbreak were unsafe sources,
contaminated raw food items, improper food storage, and
poor personal hygiene during food preparation, inadequate
cooling and reheating of food items, and a prolonged time
lapse between preparing and consuming food items [4].

Salmonella spp. are associated with a variety of food item
and known for the cause of gastroenteritis, enteric fever,
and septicemia. Foods of animal and vegetable origin such
as beef, poultry, pork, egg, raw dairy products, vegetables,
fruits, and juices are susceptible to Salmonella colonization
during production and storage.

Microorganisms contaminate meat in abattoir during
slaughtering and spread from the exterior part of animals
and from the intestinal tract. Moreover, they are added
from knives, cloths, air, workers, carts, boxes, and equip-
ments. These microorganisms begin to multiply and spoil
the meat if the environment is suitable for their growth.
Food handlers in a carrier state or having an acute infec-
tion play a significant role in transmitting infection [5–7].
Studies showed that contaminations of raw meat with
Salmonella may occur by contaminated feeds, during
transportation of animals to abattoir, slaughtering oper-
ation and fecal contamination of edible organs, and stor-
age, distribution, and preparation for consumption.
Contamination of equipment, utensils, and personal hy-
giene of food handlers help to spread Salmonella [8–13].
The occurrence and distribution of Salmonella in
Ethiopia was high. In recent years, the number of out-
breaks of Salmonella in humans has been increasing
from time to time. Much more was known about the ex-
tent of food-borne illness and its severity. Meanwhile,
the effort has not been made to overcome the problem.
Thus, food-borne pathogen continued to be a public
health challenge in Ethiopia. Studies indicated that high
percentages of Salmonella typhi isolates have been found
to be resistant for antimicrobial agents [14].

In Ethiopia, eating raw meat is an indication of wealth.
There is a popular traditional dish known locally as
“KITFO” which is prepared from minced beef and, most
of the time, it is consumed raw or moderately cooked.
The habit of raw meat consumption and the presence of
Salmonella in minced beef create a conducive environ-
ment to develop infection in the community [15].

Global trends in antimicrobial use in food animals in
2010 at 63,151 tons. It projects that antimicrobial con-
sumption will rise by 67% by 2030 and nearly double in
Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa [16].

A study conducted in Bishoftu, Ethiopia, demonstrated
the problems in clinical practice of veterinary medicine
like problems in generic prescribing, incorrect diagnosis,
and non-availability of standard veterinary treatment
guideline and drug formulary [17].

The emerging of multiple drug-resistant Salmonella to
commonly used antimicrobials has become a threat in
both public health and veterinary sectors in Ethiopia [18].
The extensive use of the first-line drugs has led to the
development of multiple drug resistance (MDR) at a level
which could pose a serious problem in the near future.
MDR is defined as resistance of an isolate to three or more
antimicrobial drugs tested [19]. People living in the
southern part of Ethiopia regularly eat raw meat, but
nothing is known about the prevalence of Salmonella in
raw beef. Therefore, this study intended to show the risk
of Salmonella associated with consuming traditional raw
meat dishes and to characterize the antimicrobial resist-
ance profile at Wolaita Sodo municipal abattoir.

Methods
Study area
This study was conducted in Wolaita Sodo town adminis-
tration, which is located in the southern part of Ethiopia
and lies between 1600 and 2100 m above sea level, 330 km
away from Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. The
total population range and household data of the town is
110,659 and 14,551, respectively,
in 2015 (information
from the study area finance office). The rainfall is bimodal
and characterized by medium rainy season from February
to May and high rainy season from July to September. The
dry season extends from October to January. There are
three sub-cities and one municipality. However, there is
only one abattoir. More than 25 cattles are slaughtered per
day in the abattoir, and majority of people have the habit
of eating raw meat in the study area. It is considered as an
indication of wealth.

Study design
A cross-sectional study was carried out from December
2015 to May 2016.

Sample size determination
The sample size was determined by taking a 17.7% preva-
lence; it was taken from a study entitled “Isolation, identifi-
cation,
public
awareness of Salmonella on raw goat meat at Dire Dawa
Municipal Abattoir, eastern Ethiopia” [20], assuming a 5%
margin of error and a 95% confidence level and a design
effect of 2 and 10% for non-response rate. The calculated
sample size was 448.

Sampling technique, sample collection, and procedures
A total of 448 cattle were included in this study. Two
carcass samples were taken from each cattle according to
the guideline [21]. Then, the cattle carcasses were taken
consecutively still to complete the final sample size.

The abdomen (flank),

thorax (lateral), crutch, and
breast (lateral) were the areas from the body parts of cat-
tle. The sampling areas were delineated by using a 10 ×
10 cm aluminum foil templates. A sterile cotton-tipped
swab (2 × 3 cm) fit with shaft was first soaked in an ap-
proximately 10 ml of buffered peptone water (BPW) and
rubbed over the delineated area horizontally and then
vertically several times. Upon completion of the rubbing
process, the swab was placed into the BPW used to wet
the swab, breaking off the wooden shaft pressing against
the inside of the universal bottle and disposed leaving
the cotton swab in the universal bottle. Other swabs of
the same types were used on the other marked areas and
placed into the same container. A second dry sterile cot-
ton swab of the same type was used as before over the
entire sampled area as above and this swab placed into
the same container. Finally, the samples were trans-
ported to Wolaita Sodo University Microbiology Labora-
tory in an ice box within an hour of collection. In
addition to this, an observational checklist was used to
assess carcass slaughtering and handling and to evaluate
hygienic practices.

Laboratory procedures
The swab samples were pre-enriched in an appropriate
amount of BPW in a 1:9 ratio and were incubated at 37 °C
for 24 h. Rappaport-Vassiliadis (RV) medium broth and
Müller-Kauffman tetrathionate with novobiocin (MKTTn)
broth were used for selective enrichment of the samples.
About 0.1 ml of the pre-enriched samples was transferred
into a tube containing 10 ml of RV broth and incubated at
42 °C for 24 h. Another 1 ml of the pre-enriched broth
was transferred into a tube containing 10 ml of MKTTn
broth and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h.

Plating out and identification
Xylose lysine desoxycholate (XLD) agar and brilliant green
agar (BGA) plates were used for plating out and identifica-
tion. A loop full of inoculums from each RV and MKTTn

broth cultures were plated onto XLD and BGA plates and
incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, the plates
were examined for the presence of typical and suspected
colonies. Typical colonies of Salmonella [22], H2S-nega-
tive variants, and lactose-positive Salmonella were grown
on XLD agar. Five typical or suspected colonies were se-
lected from the selective plating media, were streaked
onto the surface of pre-dried nutrient agar plates, and
were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Biochemical tests were
done according to ISO-6579, 2002. Triple sugar iron (TSI)
agar, Simmon’s citrate indole motility (SIM) test, and cit-
rate and urease tests were done.

Antimicrobial susceptibility tests
Antibiogram was done on Mueller-Hinton agar [23]. The
following 12 antimicrobial agents’ resistance profiles, gen-
tamicin (GEN 10 μg), tetracycline (TE 30 μg), amoxicillin/
clavulanic acid (30 μg), ampicillin (AMP 10 μg), kanamy-
cin (K-30 μg), nitrofuran (F 50 μg), streptomycin (S10 μg),
ceftriaxone (CRO 30 μg), chloramphenicol (CHL 30 μg),
clindamycin (DA 30 μg), nalidixic acid (NA 30 μg), and
ciprofloxacin (CIP 5 μg), were done. All the antibiotic
disks were purchased from Abtek Biological Ltd. (Liver-
pool). Inhibition diameters were interpreted according to
the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Instructions. The susceptibility, intermediate, and resist-
ance characterizations were based on the recommenda-
tions from the CLSI and according to the manufacturer’s
leaflet attached to the disks [24].

Quality control
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC-27853), Staphylococcus
aureus (ATCC-25923), and Escherichia coli (ATCC-25922)
were used as a quality control throughout the study for
culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. All the
strains were obtained from the Ethiopian Public Health
Institute.

detected in 56 (12.5%). Of
contaminated samples, tetracycline-resistant isolates were
detected
by
nitrofurantoin-resistant isolates, which was detected in 41
samples (73.21%). Streptomycin- and chloramphenicol-
resistant
isolates were detected in 37 (66.1%) and 29
(51.8%) samples respectively. Moreover, all isolated Salmon-
ella spp. exhibited resistance to three or more antimicrobial
agents and ciprofloxacin-susceptible isolates were detected
in 49 samples

gentamicin-susceptible isolates were detected in 33 and 31
samples, which were 58.91 and 55.4% respectively (Table 1)
(Fig. 1) (Additional file 1).

Discussion
In this study, the contamination frequency of Salmonella
species in raw beef was high (12.5%). The finding of this
study was moderately higher than that of studies con-
ducted in Modjo (8.3%) and Bishoftu (7.5%) [25, 26]. This
difference could be due to the differences in the hygienic
and sanitary practices in the abattoirs, the environment
upon which the meat was slaughtered, and the water used
in the processing of the meat. Wolaita Sodo municipal
abattoir provides service for people residing in the town.
Therefore, less emphasis was given to overcome the spread
of potential pathogenic microorganisms when we com-
pared with the referenced area. The abattoirs found in
Modjo and Bishoftu town were export abattoirs. However,
this study was in line with the studies conducted in Tigray
region of Ethiopia; the Salmonella spp. prevalence was
16.4% [27] and at Dire Dawa abattoir 17.7% [20].

Studies conducted in different parts of Ethiopia showed
that the prevalence of raw beef with Salmonella spp. varies
from 5.3 to 17.7%, for instance, studies conducted in Addis
Ababa, Bahir Dar, and Harar [28–31]. Though this study
finding falls in the abovementioned range, there was a
visible variation of Salmonella spp. prevalence. This might
be because of the diversity in sampling methods, sampling
seasons, and sampling as well as culturing techniques [32].
In addition, sanitation within the slaughterhouse and the
cross-contamination of carcasses by contact with intestinal

tracts during slaughter or processing were also important
factors [33, 34].

With regard to the emerging of multidrug-resistant
Salmonella, the following studies had been witnessing anti-
microbial resistance of Salmonella to commonly used anti-
microbials in both public health and veterinary sectors were
increasing from time to time [35–42]. According to the
present study, all 56 (100%) isolates were multidrug-resistant.
This was similar with other studies conducted in Ethiopia,
for instance, studies conducted in Jimma [35, 43] and Gon-
dar [39, 41] and a study conducted among Ethiopian chil-
dren. These studies had shown that Salmonella exhibited
100% resistance to multidrug. Furthermore, studies car-
ried out around the globe [44–48] supported that Salmon-
ella isolated from food of animal sources exhibited
resistance to multidrug. The following studies reported
the magnitude of multidrug-resistance of Salmonella iso-
lates respectively as follows: 16%, 50% (from raw meats),
52%, 74.1 and 63.7% (from different types of samples), and
71.7 and 87.82%. This difference could be antimicrobial-
resistant Salmonella were increasing due to the use of
antimicrobial agents in food animals at the sub-thera-
peutic level or prophylactic doses, which might promote
on-farm selection of antimicrobial-resistant strains and
markedly increase the human health risks associated with
consumption of contaminated meat products [36, 49, 50].
Salmonella isolates identified from food items and
workers from Addis Ababa were resistant to the commonly
used antibiotics including streptomycin, ampicillin, and
tetracycline [50]. Furthermore, resistance of Salmonella
isolates to the commonly used antimicrobials including
ampicillin, streptomycin, nitrofurantoin, kanamycin and
tetracycline were 100, 66.7, 58.3, and 33.3% respectively
[51]. This was in line with the previous studies conducted
to assess ampicillin-resistant Salmonella in South India
100% [52], Nigeria over 90% [53], and Cameroon 100%
[54]. This study also indicated resistance of Salmonella
isolates to commonly used antimicrobials including tetra-
cycline, nitrofurantoin, streptomycin, kanamycin and ampi-
cillin were 83.9, 73.2, 66, 50, and 46.43% respectively. A
higher resistance rate was observed in this study when
compared with the previous reports with the exception of
ampicillin. In addition to this, resistance to amoxicillin-
clavulanic acid and nalidixic acid were 42.9 and 39.3% re-
spectively. This difference could be due to the increasing
rate of inappropriate utilization of antibiotics, which favors
selection pressure that increase the advantage of maintain-
ing resistant genes in bacteria [55, 56]. Resistance to
amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was observed, but it was intro-
duced in the market in the last few years. The continuing
development of antibiotic resistance could pose pressure to
both animals and human being. Once the amoxicillin-
clavulanic acid-resistant strains spread to human being, it
might be difficult to treat with drug currently available in

the market [57]. In addition to public health problems, it
could lead to economic loss in the country due to loss of
exporting meat and animal products.

Ciprofloxacin showed a good antimicrobial activity
against the Salmonella isolates. From the 56 isolates, 49
(87.5%) were susceptible to ciprofloxacin which was
comparable to the previous studies conducted in Ethiopia
[49], Nigeria [53], and Addis Ababa [51]. The effectiveness
of ciprofloxacin might be a recent introduction of the drug.
It is not widely used in countries like Ethiopia and other
African countries [51].

Conclusions
Salmonella species contamination frequency was high in
raw beef, and most of the isolates exhibited resistance to
commonly used antibiotics. Tetracycline-resistant and
ciprofloxacin-susceptible Salmonella species were fre-
quently detected in raw beef. People living in the town and
consuming the raw meat are at risk for developing
diseases, and attention should be given to select antimi-
crobials in treating Salmonella infections in both animals
and human being based on antimicrobial susceptibility
test. Hence,
intersectoral working and developing one
health approach is essential. Health information should be
given to individuals who have the habit of eating raw
meat. Training on sanitary and hygiene practice should be
given to the abattoir workers. WHO basic hygiene princi-
ples, which cover food safety procedures from the farm of
origin to ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection to
handling until the food is consumed, should be practiced.
