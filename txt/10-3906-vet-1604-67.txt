Abstract:  In  this  study,  Salmonella  strains  from  dairy  cows,  calves  with  diarrhea,  and  buffalo  and  camel  feces  were  isolated  and 
serotyped. There were 869 feces samples (437 calves, 287 dairy cows, 100 buffalo, and 45 camels) collected from 13 provinces and 21 
farms. Preenrichment feces samples were added to Rappaport-Vassiliadis medium. Samples were then subcultured on xylose lysine 
tergitol-4 agar and plates. Suspected colonies of Salmonella were confirmed by latex agglutination test. The isolates of Salmonella spp. 
were serotyped at the Etlik Central Veterinary Control Institute. In total, 40 Salmonella spp. were isolated, including 33 from calves, 5 
from dairy cows, 1 from a buffalo, and 1 from a camel. Salmonella strains were serotyped as S. Kentucky (n = 23), S. Muenchen (n = 
5), S. Anatum (n = 4), S. Gaminare (n = 4), S. Typhimurium (n = 1), S. Muenster (n = 1), S. Enteritidis (n = 1), and S. Abony (n = 1). 
The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method was used for the determination of antibiotic susceptibilities of isolates against 15 antibiotics. 
Salmonella isolates were determined as resistant to multiple antibiotics. In conclusion, 8 different Salmonella serotypes were found in 
dairy cows, calves, buffalo, and camels. Because of the occurrence of multiresistant isolates, biosafety measures and pathogen control 
processes are advised for Salmonella-associated risks to public health.

1. Introduction
Salmonellosis is a common bacterial enteric infection with 
significant  economic  losses  for  the  intensive  production 
of cattle, sheep, and poultry (1,2). Salmonella species are 
zoonotic  and  are  transmitted  to  humans  via  ingestion 
of  contaminated  milk,  eggs,  and  meat  (3,4).  Although 
Salmonella infections may occur at any age in cattle, the 
associated  clinical  symptoms  are  more  severe  in  calves 
from the first 2 weeks to 3 months of their life (5,6). 

Salmonella  enterica  subsp.  enterica  may  cause 
infections  associated  with  several  clinical  symptoms 
or  systemic  infections  characterized  by  diarrhea  and 
septicemia  and  may  even  lead  to  death  in  severe  cases. 
It can be harbored by asymptomatic carriers (2,5). In the 
enteric form of salmonellosis, the stool is sticky and watery 
and  has  a  putrid  odor.  It  may  contain  flecks  of  mucus, 
shreds of the mucous membrane, and in some cases blood. 
Young  calves  and  lambs  frequently  develop  septicemia. 
Furthermore, marked depression, fever, symptoms of the 
central nervous system, pneumonia, and death within 2–3 
days can also occur (7–9).

Clinical  symptoms  and  necropsy  findings  alone  are 
not  sufficient  for  a  definitive  diagnosis  of  Salmonella 
infection.  It  is  imperative  to  isolate  and  identify  the 
causative Salmonella species (10–12). While the isolation 
of Salmonella is relatively easy via bacterial culture from 
samples  taken  from  animals  with  septicemia,  carcasses, 
and the organs of aborted fetuses, enrichment is needed 
to increase the chance of isolating Salmonella from feed 
samples  or  from  fecal  cultures  used  to  detect  carriers 
(7,13,14).

This  study  aimed  to  isolate  and  serotype  Salmonella 
species  from  fecal  samples  of  dairy  cattle,  calves  with 
diarrhea,  camels,  and  water  buffaloes  and  to  determine 
sensitivities of the isolates to antibiotics. 

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Sampling
A total of 869 fecal samples were collected from 21 herds 
in 13 provinces (Konya, Kayseri, Düzce, Kahramanmaraş, 
Şanlıurfa,  Amasya,  Aksaray,  Adıyaman,  Afyonkarahisar, 
Aydın, Kırşehir, Niğde, and İzmir) in Turkey. Of these, 437 

193

were taken from calves, 287 from dairy cattle, 100 from 
water buffaloes, and 45 from camels. These samples were 
transferred  under  cold-chain  conditions  and  within  the 
shortest time possible to the laboratory of the Microbiology 
Department  of  Selçuk  University,  Faculty  of  Veterinary 
Medicine, in Turkey.
2.2. Microbiological examination
Detection of the presence of Salmonella spp. was carried out 
according to the ISO 6579 standard. For preenrichment, 
the fecal samples were cultured in 1:10 buffered peptone 
and  water  (2.5  g  of  feces  and  22.5  mL  of  medium)  and 
incubated  at  37  °C  for  24  h.  Subsequently,  selective 
enrichment was performed by culturing 1 mL of sample 
into  Rappaport-Vassiliadis  medium.  The  culture  was 
incubated at 42 °C for 24 h. Finally, for selective culturing, 
the samples were passaged onto xylose lysine deoxycholate 
(XLD)  and/or  xylose  lysine  tergitol-4  (XLT-4)  agar  and 
incubated  at  37  °C  for  24–48  h.  Colorless  or  light  pink 
colonies with darker centers on XLD agar or black colonies 
on XLT-4 agar were suspected of being Salmonella (15,16). 
2.3. Serological confirmation and serotyping 
Microorganisms  suspected  of  being  Salmonella  strains 
were  tested  with  a  Salmonella  latex  agglutination  kit 
(17,18). The Salmonella isolates that gave positive results 
by the latex agglutination test were serotyped at the Etlik 
Central Veterinary Control Institute.
2.4. Antibiotic sensitivity test
The antibiotic sensitivity tests of the Salmonella isolates were 
performed by by the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method using 
oxytetracycline (30 µg), gentamycin (10 µg), erythromycin 
(15  µg),  cefuroxime  (30  µg),  chloramphenicol  (30  µg), 
danofloxacin (5 µg), ampicillin (25 µg), amoxicillin (25 µg), 
cephalexin  (30  µg),  kanamycin  (75  µg),  spectinomycin  G 
(10  U),  ceftiofur  (30  µg),  lincomycin+spectinomycin  (10

µg),  enrofloxacin  (5  µg),  and  rifamycin  (30  µg)  disks  and 
Mueller-Hinton agar (19). The results were evaluated after 
the media were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h.

3. Results
Salmonella strains were isolated from 8 herds (61.5%); 40 
(4.60%) Salmonella isolates were recovered from 869 fecal 
samples (Table 1). Salmonella strains were isolated from 
calves (7.5%, 33/437), dairy cows (1.74%, 5/287), a buffalo 
(1%, 1/100), and a camel (2.22%, 1/45).

Salmonella  isolates  in  calves  were  serotyped  as  S. 
Kentucky  (8,20:i:z6)  (n  =  19),  S.  Muenchen  (6,8:d:1,2) 
(n  =  5),  S.  Gaminare  (16:d:1,7)  (n  =  4),  S.  Anatum 
(3,10,[15],[15,34]:e,h:1,6)  (n  =  3),  S.  Enteritidis  (1,  9,12: 
g,m:-) (n = 1), and S. Muenster (3,10[15][15,34]:e,h:1,5) 
(n  =  1).  Salmonella 
in  dairy  cows  were 
serotyped  as  S.  Kentucky  (8,20:i:z6)  (n  =  3),  S.  Anatum 
(3,10,[15],[15,34]:e,h:1,6)  (n  =  1),  and  S.  Typhimurium 
(1,4,[5],12:i:1,2) (n = 1). In addition, 1 isolate in buffalo 
was S. Kentucky (8,20:i:z6) and the 1 isolate in camel was S. 
Abony (1,4,[5],12,27:b:e,n,x) (Table 1). 

isolates 

All Salmonella isolates were resistant to one or more 
antibiotics.  All  Salmonella  serotypes  were  resistant  to 
erythromycin  and  rifamycin.  In  addition,  all  Salmonella 
serotypes (except S. Abony) were resistant to amoxicillin. 
S. Enteritidis was resistant to 10 antibiotics; S. Gaminare to 
8; S. Abony to 6; S. Kentucky, S. Anatum, S. Typhimurium, 
and S. Muenchen to 4; and S. Muenster to 3. However, all 
Salmonella serotypes were susceptible to cefuroxime and 
ceftiofur (Table 2).

4. Discussion
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica is a food pathogen that 
may  cause  disease  in  both  people  and  animals  (3,5,20). 
Some  of  the  Salmonella  species  are  host-specific.  They

can be asymptomatic or can cause death (9,21). There are 
over 2500 Salmonella serovars and, due to the diversity of 
host  types,  Salmonella  control  is  compulsory  in  animal 
production  (22).  Infected  animals  may  spread  the  agent 
through feces without showing any clinical symptoms (23).
For  Salmonella  isolation,  three  cultural  procedure 
stages  are  generally  used:  preenrichment,  selective 
enrichment,  and  selective  culture  (15,16).  In 
the 
preenrichment stage, the most commonly used media are 
buffered peptone water (BPW) and lactose broth (15). In 
selective  enrichment,  media  that  support  production  of 
Salmonella  and  inhibit  production  of  other  bacteria  are 
used. Media such as tetrathionate broth, selenite-cysteine 
broth, selenite broth, and Rappaport-Vassiliadis broth are 
widely  used  (15).  In  selective  culture,  MacConkey  agar, 
Salmonella-Shigella  agar,  XLD  agar,  Rambach  agar,  and 
XLT-4  agar  could  be  used  (15,16).  In  this  study,  BPW 

was  used  for  preenrichment.  For  selective  enrichment, 
Rappaport-Vassiliadis  broth  was  used,  and  XLT-4  and 
XLD agar was used for the isolation of Salmonella species. 
The  source  of  Salmonella-based  diseases  in  people 
is  often  subclinically  infected  local  dairy  cattle  (22,24). 
Cattle  are  the  most  important  Salmonella  reservoir 
agents and consumption of infected cattle meat is related 
to  salmonellosis  epidemics  (25).  Various  studies  were 
carried out to isolate and serotype Salmonella from dairy 
cattle and calves (4,7,14,18,21,22,24). Several researchers 
(4,7,14,18,21,22,24) reported that Salmonella isolates were 
identified  as  S.  Typhimurium,  S.  Dublin,  S.  Agona,  S. 
Orion, S. Aintpul, S. Braenderup, S. Muenchen, S. Croft, S. 
Kentucky, S. Telaviv, S. Montevideo, S. Kpeme, S. Infantis, 
S.  Abadina,  S.  Cerro,  S.  Mismarhaenek,  S.  Enteritidis, 
S.  Guildford,  S.  Anatum,  S.  Gozo,  S.  Mbandaka,  S. 
Senftenberg, S. Newport, S. Give, and S. Muenster.

HADİMLİ et al. / Turk J Vet Anim SciFecal  Salmonella  studies  in  Turkey  are  usually  based 
on slaughterhouse samples or case-based notices. Gökçen 
et al. (26) isolated S. Typhimurium from the small bowel 
contents of only one cow out of 298 cattle. Akbarut (27) 
did not isolate Salmonella from fecal samples of 119 cattle. 
Genç (14) isolated Salmonella in 0.7% of 1000 feces samples 
obtained  from  cattle  slaughtered  in  Kars.  They  were 
serotyped  as  S.  Enteritidis  (n  =  5)  and  S.  Typhimurium 
(n = 1). Erganiş et al. (10) isolated S. Typhimurium from 
the  internal  organs  of  2  feedlot  calves  with  septicemia. 
Canpolat and Akan (28) isolated only 1 (0.9%) Salmonella 
sp.  from  fecal  samples  of  106  cattle.  Hadimli  et  al.  (9) 
reported  that  3  S.  Dublin  specimens  were  isolated  from 
liver, spleen, and mesenteric lymph node samples of dead 
calves. 

In our study, fecal samples were collected from calves 
and dairy cattle with diarrhea from 13 provinces and 21 
different enterprises. Salmonella spp. was isolated from 8 
(38.09%) out of 21 enterprises and 40 (4.6%) out of 869 
fecal  samples.  Thirty-three  isolates  were  isolated  from 
calves,  5  from  dairy  cows,  1  from  buffalo,  and  1  from 
camel. Nineteen of the calves’ isolates were S. Kentucky, 5 
were S. Muenchen, 4 were S. Gaminare, 3 were S. Anatum, 
1 was S. Enteritidis, and 1 was S. Muenster. Three isolates 
from dairy cattle were S. Kentucky, 1 was S. Anatum, and 1 
was S. Typhimurium. S. Kentucky was the most commonly 
isolated serotype. 

Any  clinical  signs  and  death  for  salmonellosis  were 
observed in sampling dairy cows and buffaloes. Sampling 
was  done  considering  that  these  animals  may  have  had 
salmonellosis as reservoirs. Three isolates and one isolate 
were  isolated  from  dairy  cows  and  buffalo,  respectively. 
Three  different  Salmonella  serotypes  (S.  Kentucky,  S. 
Anatum,  and  S.  Typhimurium)  were  determined.  S. 
Gaminare,  S.  Muenchen,  S.  Enteritidis,  and  S.  Muenster 
isolates  were  separately  isolated  each  from  a  single 
enterprise. Any clinical signs and death for salmonellosis 
were observed in sampling calves. S. Anatum isolates were 
recovered from different enterprises, and 2 isolates were 
isolated from calves and one isolate from a dairy cow. S. 
Kentucky isolates in an enterprise including dairy cows, 
calves, and buffaloes were isolated from calves with widely 
observed cases of diarrhea and death. In this enterprise, 19, 
3, and 1 S. Kentucky isolates were recovered from calves, 
dairy  cows,  and  buffaloes,  respectively.  S.  Typhimurium 
was also isolated from the same enterprise. Moreover, S. 
Abony was isolated from a camel.

Salmonella infections have a subclinical course. There 
are  isolates  with  resistance  against  multiple  antibiotics 
(5,29,30).  Vella  and  Cushieri  (21)  stated  that  all  of  131 
Salmonella isolates were susceptible to all antibiotics; the 
most resistance was observed with trimethoprim. McEvoy 
et  al.  (20)  stated  that  S.  Typhimurium  isolates  were 

196

resistant  to  ampicillin,  chloramphenicol,  streptomycin, 
sulfafurazole, and tetracycline and S. Dublin and S. Agona 
isolates  were  sensitive  to  antibiotics.  Addis  et  al.  (30) 
reported  that  Salmonella  strains  isolated  from  fecal  and 
milk  samples  of  dairy  cattle  were  resistant  to  ampicillin 
(100%), streptomycin (66.7%), and nitrofurazone (58.3%) 
and  sensitive  to  ciprofloxacin  (91.7%),  clotrimazole 
(87.5%),  and  cephaxon  (75%).  Gorski  et  al.  (25)  stated 
that  Salmonella  isolates  were  sensitive  to  12  different 
antibiotics.  Wieczorek  and  Osek  (24)  stated  that  some 
of  the  S.  Dublin,  S.  Enteritidis,  and  S.  London  strains 
were  resistant  to  sulfamethizole.  S.  Typhimurium  is 
resistant to multiple antibiotics (ampicillin, streptomycin, 
tetracycline,  and  sulfamethizole)  (24).  Rodriquez-Rivera 
et  al.  (3)  reported  that  90  Salmonella  strains  (23.6%) 
out  of  381  from  subclinically  infected  dairy  cattle  and 
environmental  samples  were  resistant  to  antibiotics 
varying  from  1  and  11.  All  of  the  isolated  strains  were 
sensitive  to  amikacin  and  ciprofloxacin,  and  the  highest 
resistance  was  against  ampicillin  (72%),  tetracycline 
(63%), and amoxicillin+clavulanic acid (58%). Moreover, 
different serotypes or serovars may be included in strains 
that are resistant to antibiotics. 

rifamycin; 

In the present study, we found that Salmonella strains 
were  resistant  to  multiple  antibiotics.  All  S.  Kentucky 
isolates  were  resistant  to  amoxicillin,  erythromycin, 
the  S. 
lincomycin+spectinomycin, 
Muenchen isolates were resistant to amoxicillin, ampicillin, 
erythromycin, and rifamycin. The S. Typhimurium isolate 
was  resistant  to  amoxicillin,  ampicillin,  erythromycin, 
and  rifamycin;  the  S.  Abony  isolate  was  resistant  to 
lincomycin+spectinomycin,  kanamycin,  spectinomycin, 
erythromycin,  rifamycin,  and  gentamycin;  S.  Enteritidis 
was resistant to amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, 
erythromycin,  cephalexin, 
lincomycin+spectinomycin, 
oxytetracycline, kanamycin, spectinomycin, erythromycin, 
and rifamycin; all the S. Gaminare isolates were resistant 
to erythromycin, cephalexin, lincomycin+spectinomycin, 
oxytetracycline,  kanamycin,  spectinomycin,  rifamycin, 
and  gentamycin;  and  S.  Muenster  was  resistant  to 
amoxicillin, erythromycin, and gentamycin. 

In  conclusion,  Salmonella  is  present  in  cows,  calves, 
buffaloes, and camels in Turkey. For public health, biosafety 
measures and pathogen control processes are needed.
