Abstract

Background: Ethiopia bears the largest burden of foodborne diseases in Africa, and diarrheal diseases are the
second leading causes of premature deaths. Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157 causes an asymptomatic
infection to severe diarrhea and/or hemolytic-uremic syndrome in humans.
Methods: A total of 440 beef carcass and in-contact surface swabs from 55 butcher shops and 85 minced beef
samples from 40 restaurants in central Ethiopia were collected and examined for the presence of E. coli O157.
Standard microbiological methods were used to isolate and identify E. coli O157 and to characterize the
antimicrobial resistance of the isolates.
Results: E. coli O157 was detected in 4.5% carcass swabs (n = 5) and 3.6% cutting board swabs (n = 4) samples from
butcher shops. E. coli O157 was not detected in any of the minced beef samples obtained from restaurants. All isolates
(n = 9) were 100% susceptible to five drugs, but five isolates were resistant to amoxicillin, two isolates to streptomycin
and three isolates to chloramphenicol. One isolate was resistant to two drugs and another to three drugs.
Conclusions: The present study shows a low prevalence of E. coli O157 in beef sold at butcher shops. Nevertheless,
given the low infective dose of this pathogen and the deep-rooted tradition of consuming raw or undercooked beef,
the current prevalence should not be considered lightly from a public health perspective.

Background
In the 21st century, foodborne diseases have become one
of the important issues all over the world [1]. Due to
poor infrastructure and low level of awareness,
this
problem is worse in developing countries [2]. Major
pathogenic microorganisms that frequently have been
associated with foods of animal origin include Enterohe-
morrhagic Escherichia coli O157. In humans this pathogen
causes asymptomatic infection to severe diarrhea and/or
hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) [3]. Human infections
with E. coli O157 have been mostly associated with the

consumption of contaminated and improperly cooked
minced beef and unpasteurized cow milk [4]. Butcher
houses and restaurants are frequently incriminated as
sources of E. coli O157 for human infections [5].

Ethiopia ranks second after Nigeria in the health burden
of zoonotic diseases in Africa [6]. This country is located
in a sub-region that experiences the second highest food-
borne disease burden in the world, where E. coli O157 is
one of the leading causes of foodborne disease disability
adjusted life years [7]. In Ethiopia, years of life lost due to
diarrheal diseases was 2.6 million in 2010, and diarrheal
diseases are the second leading cause of premature death
after lower respiratory infections [8]. Information about
human infections with E. coli O157 is limited in this
country, however, in a study conducted on 422 diarrheic
children under 5 years in northern part of Ethiopia, E. coli

O157:H7 was isolated from 59 (28.9%) of the children [9].
The habit of consuming raw and/or undercooked meat is
one of the factors that exacerbate the transmission of
foodborne pathogens including E. coli O157 in the coun-
try. Sufficient heating of meat kills these organisms [4];
however, in Ethiopia, most people prefer to eat raw or
undercooked beef (locally called kitfo, dulet, and kurt).

Treatment of Enterohemorrhagic E. coli

infections
with antibiotics may worsen the illness, presumably by
breaking up the bacteria with the release of more toxins
and increased toxin production [10]. However, early ad-
ministration using some antimicrobials is effective [11].
Unfortunately, inappropriate ways of antimicrobial uses
have contributed to the increase in antimicrobial resist-
ance [12].

In Ethiopia, only few small-scale studies estimating the
prevalence and/or assessing the antimicrobial sensitivity
profile of enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157 in feces, skin
swabs and carcasses of sheep, goats, and cattle at abattoirs
were conducted [13–16]. But studies at the level of con-
sumption particularly in butcher shops and restaurants is
lacking. Consequently, this study was designed to address
the information gap pertaining to the prevalence and anti-
biotic susceptibility profiles of E. coli O157 in beef carcass
and minced beef at butcher shops and restaurants respect-
ively in central Ethiopia.

Methods
Study design and sample collection
From December 2013 to April 2014, carcass and carcass
in-contact
surface swabs of 55 randomly selected
butcher shops, and minced beef samples of 40 randomly
selected restaurants were collected in four cities (Addis
Ababa, Bishoftu, Batu, and Holetta) in central Ethiopia.

These cities have municipal abattoirs which render
slaughter services to their respective dwellers. Butcher
shops and restaurants get their beef from cattle slaugh-
tered in the abattoirs of their respective cities. Neverthe-
less, back yard or illegal slaughtering of animals is a
common practice. The abattoirs are barely equipped
with necessary facilities, and shortage of clean water is
one of the chronic problems for most abattoirs in the
country. In addition, the sanitary condition of most
restaurants and butcher shops is poor; generally, such
food catering firms are loosely monitored and regulated.
In Ethiopia, fresh beef cuts are commonly purchased
from butcher shops and are consumed at home or at the
same butcher shop, either cooked or raw. In butcher’s
shops, a beef carcass is kept in open-air at environmen-
tal
temperature (in Addis Ababa 7 to 25 °C daily
temperature).

The butcher shops and restaurants in each city were
selected by a simple random sampling technique, using
lists obtained from city administrations of the respective

cities as sampling frames. When visiting each selected
butcher shop and restaurant, the purpose of the study
was explained to the manager, and a letter from the
College of Veterinary Medicine and Agriculture Addis
Ababa University demonstrated the approval and cred-
ibility of our work. From each butcher shop on average
eight samples were collected on two separate days. A
total of 440 swab samples consisting of 110 samples
from beef carcass, knife, cutting board, and butcher’s
hands at butcher shops, respectively, and 85 minced beef
(locally also called kitfo) samples from restaurants were
collected (Table 1). Beef carcasses were swabbed follow-
ing the method described in ISO17604 (2003). A sterile
cotton tipped swab (2X3cm) fitted with shaft, was first
soaked in an approximately 10 ml of buffered peptone
water (BPW; Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) and subsequently
rubbed horizontally and vertically several times on the
carcass surface. After the rubbing process, the shaft was
broken by pressing it against the inner wall of the test
tube leaving the cotton swab inside the test tube. The
whole surface of the carcass was swabbed by one swab,
and swabs from multiple carcasses from the same
butcher shop were pooled together. Carcass in-contact
surfaces including knife, butcher’s hands and cutting
board swabs were obtained by swabbing them using a
cotton swab pre-moistened in BPW. The junction of the
handle and blade of all knives in each butcher shop was
swabbed and pooled together. Similarly, both sides of
the two hands of the butcher, and the whole surface of
the wooden cutting board were swabbed. The carcass
swab, the butcher’s hands swab, the cutting board swab
and the knife swab were kept separately. The minced
beef samples were taken from ready-to-eat undercooked
(n = 45) and raw minced beef (n = 40) at the selected
restaurants. All samples were transported in cold boxes
to the laboratory. The samples were stored at 4 to 7 °C
and analyzed within 6 to 12 h as described in ISO
16654:2001.

Sample processing
Ninety ml of modified tryptone soy broth supplemented
with novobiocin (mTSB + N; Oxoid) were added to
10 ml swab sample. Conversely, 25 g of each minced
beef sample were collected in a Stomacher bag. After
adding 225 ml mTSB + N, each sample was homoge-
nized using a Stomacher 400 (Seward Medical, England)
for two minutes and transferred into a sterile flask. After
incubation at 41.5 ± 0.5 °C for 24 h, all enrichment
broths were plated onto sorbitol MacConkey agar
(Oxoid) supplemented with 0.05 mg/l cefixime and
2.5 mg/l potassium tellurite (Oxoid) (SMAC-CT) and in-
cubated at 37 °C for 18 to 24 h. Multiple non-sorbitol
fermenting typical E. coli colonies from a plate were
streaked out on the SMAC-CT agar and incubated for

did not ferment sorbitol on the SMAC-CT agar under-
went a slide agglutination test using an E. coli O157
latex test kit (Oxoid) and were considered E. coli O157
positive when precipitation occurred within one minute.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
The E. coli O157 isolates were tested for antimicrobial
susceptibility to a panel of the following ten antimicro-
bial agents: amoxicillin (AMX 25 μg), kanamycin (KAN
30 μg),
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT 25 μg),
chloramphenicol (CHL 30 μg), ciprofloxacin (CPR 5 μg),
streptomycin (STR 10 μg), nalidixic acid (NA 30 μg),
cefoxitin (CFX 30 μg), tetracycline (TTC 30 μg), and
nitrofurantoin (NTR 50 μg) using the disc diffusion
method according to the guidelines for Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute [17]. All test discs were
obtained from Oxoid. The isolates were classified as
sensitive, intermediate, or resistant using the breakpoints
of the CLSI. The standard reference strain of E. coli
ATCC 25922, sensitive to all tested antimicrobial agents,
was used as the control strain.

Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed using STATA Version 11.0
(STATA corp. College Station, TX, USA). Descriptive sta-
tistics (estimation of proportions) were used to summarize
the prevalence of E. coli O157 and antimicrobial sensitivity
patterns of the isolates.

Results
E. coli O157 isolated from butcher shops and restaurants
Out of the 525 collected samples, 60 of them had E. coli
O157 suspect colonies on the CT- SMAC plates (40
samples from the butcher shops and 20 samples from
the restaurants). Only nine (1.7%, 95% CI: 0.8–3.3%)
of the 525 examined samples were confirmed to be
positive for E. coli O157 (Table 1). Two samples (one
carcass swab and one cutting board swab) obtained
from the same butcher shop during the same visit
were positive for E. coli O157, but in the other cases,
the positive carcass swabs and the positive cutting

boards swabs were from different butcher shops. E.
coli O157 was not detected in any of the minced beef
samples.

Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of E. coli O157 isolates
All isolates were susceptible (100%) to five of the ten
antimicrobial
(trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,
tetracycline, cefoxitin, kanamycin, and nalidixic acid;
Table 2). Conversely, 5, 3, and 2 of the isolates were resist-
ant to amoxicillin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol,
respectively. Only two of the isolates were susceptible to
all examined antimicrobial agents. One isolate from the
carcass was resistant to amoxicillin and chloramphenicol,
and one isolate from the cutting board was resistant to
amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, and streptomycin.

Discussion
Food borne infections are major health concerns in
developing countries including Ethiopia. Information on
incidence of these infections and their susceptibility to
antimicrobials helps policy makers to develop appropri-
ate strategies in terms of prevention, treatment and
control. In this study, 4.5% (5/110) carcass swabs were
positive for E. coli O157. Tendencies for higher preva-
lences were observed in previous studies. In one of the
studies, eight of 86 beef samples (i.e. 9.3%) collected
from butcher shops in central Ethiopia were positive
[14]. Hiko et al. [14] examined meat samples while we
tested swabs of carcass surfaces and carcass in-contact
surfaces. Likewise, Mersha, Asrat [18] found at an export
abattoir in central Ethiopia that 8.1% (14/172) of sheep
and goat carcass surface swabs taken before washing and
8.7% (15/172) of carcass surface swabs after washing
were contaminated by E. coli O157:H7. Also, the preva-
lence of E. coli O157 in the carcass surface swabs of our
study (4.5%) was similar to reports from eastern Ethiopia
(2.65%, 3/113 beef carcass surface swabs) at Haramaya
University slaughter house [16] and from Turkey (2%,
2/100 beef carcass surface swabs) at two commercial
abattoirs in Samsun Province [19], and from the UK
(2.9%, 29/1877 samples of lamb products) at butcher
shops in South Yorkshire. However, the prevalence in

beef products at the same butcher shops tended to be
lower (1.1%, 36/3216 samples of beef products) [3].
Nevertheless differences
in prevalences could have
been due to the limited sample size in our and several of
the other studies.

In this study, E. coli O157 was isolated from 3.6%
the surface swabs of wooden cutting
(4/110) of
boards; however, none of
the swabs from butcher
hands and knives were positive. In a similar kind of
study conducted in Pakistan, E. coli O157:H7 was not
detected in surface swabs (knives, wooden boards,
weighing scales, and meat mincers) taken from 30 in-
dividual retail meat outlet markets [20]. In our study,
in one case both the beef carcass surface swab and
the cutting board swab collected during the same visit
to the same butcher shop were positive,
indicating
the possible contamination of the wooden board by
the carcass or vice versa; however,
in other three
cases, E. coli O157 was not detected in the carcass
samples from butcher shops where the cutting boards
were positive. The isolation of E. coli O157 from the
carcass in-contact material although the carcass itself
was negative, may suggest the presence of other po-
tential sources of contamination in butcher shops like
cleaning water or inadequate cleaning and disinfection
of
leading to possible biofilm
formation by the organisms on the wooden board.
Indeed, E. coli O157 has been isolated from water
samples in Ethiopia [13, 18] and biofilm formation of
E. coli O157 in various food contact surfaces and
tolerance to sanitizing reagents has been reported
[21, 22]. E. coli O157 contaminated cutting boards
can be an important source of cross contamination
and may pose a significant public health risk.

the cutting boards

E. coli O157 was not detected in the 85 minced beef
samples from the 40 restaurants, which is in agreement

with reports from Turkey [23] and Seattle, USA [24]. By
contrast, 11.25% of cooked beef doner kebabs in Turkey
[25] and 3.8% of minced beef in Argentina [26] were
contaminated by E. coli O157:H7. In our study, the
inability of isolating E. coli O157 from the ground beef
samples where the contamination of beef carcass at
butcher shops and abattoirs is not uncommon could be
attributed to the way kitfo is prepared. Minced beef is
seasoned with butter and other spices to prepare kitfo.
Antimicrobial effects of some Ethiopian spices against E.
coli and other organisms have been demonstrated [27].
The spice blends may stress the organisms, which may
make the isolation of E. coli O157 from contaminated
samples difficult. However, the stressed organisms retain
their pathogenicity and thus pose risk to humans, given
the fact that E. coli O157 has a low infective dose [11].
The small number of samples considered in the current
study calls for a further large scale study to estimate the
real prevalence of E. coli O157 in kitfo, and to investigate
whether the kitfo preparation process has a possible
antibacterial effect. Before such a study can be done an
evaluation of
the applied detection
method to isolate possible sub-lethal injured E. coli O157,
caused by spices in such beef product, is recommended.

the efficiency of

In the present study some of the isolates were resistant
to amoxicillin (n = 5), streptomycin (n = 3), and chloram-
phenicol (n = 2). While previous studies from Ethiopia
and other countries reported resistance to amoxicillin
and/or streptomycin,
the resistance observed against
chloramphenicol in the current study is in contrast to
the previous reports of 100% susceptibility to this anti-
biotic [13, 14, 16, 28]. On the other hand, resistance to
chloramphenicol and other drugs have been reported
elsewhere [29, 30]. In the present study, one isolate was
resistant to two antimicrobials (amoxicillin and chloram-
phenicol) and another isolate to three antimicrobials

Beyi et al. BMC Microbiology  (2017) 17:49 

Page 5 of 6

(amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, and streptomycin), which
is in agreement with previous studies [13, 14, 16, 29, 31].
In current study, a low level of antimicrobial resistance
was observed in comparison to previous studies; this
might be related to the fewer number of antimicrobial
panels we used. However, the current finding has a
significant public health implication.

Among the antimicrobials we examined, trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole is one of the β-lactams antibiotics that
their prescription for E. coli O157:H7 infections is debat-
able, as these drugs may surge the risk of HUS in children
[32–34]. On the other hand, another study shows that in
the early stage of infections these antibiotics do not entail
risk [35]. Some of the drugs we tested such as amoxicillin,
cifoxitin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxasole can increase
the risk of HUS; and thus they are not recommended for
the treatment of infections caused by E.coli O157:H7.
Fluoroquinolones family drugs such as ciprofloxacin and
nalidixic acid are commonly prescribed for adults but not
for children. However, two of our isolates showed inter-
mediate resistant to ciprofloxacin which is alarming.

study demonstrates

Conclusions
In conclusion,
low
prevalence of E. coli O157 (1.7%) in butcher shops in
central Ethiopia. Nevertheless, given the low infective
dose of E. coli O157 and the deep-rooted tradition of
consuming raw or undercooked beef in the society, the
current prevalence should be considered important from
a public health perspective and surveillance to monitor
E. coli O157 and other pathogens in butcher shops
should be organized. E. coli O157 was detected on cut-
ting boards in four butcher shops, indicating that such
equipment can function as a source for contamination
of beef. In order to prevent such contamination butchers
have to improve their hygiene practice. E. coli O157 was
not detected in the kitfo samples from restaurants.
Presence of spices in kitfo may lead to sub-lethal E. coli
O157 cells leading to false-negative results. The isolates
were susceptible to most of the drugs used in the in
vitro test; however, the resistance observed against chlor-
amphenicol in the current study is in contrast to the
previous three studies in Ethiopia.
