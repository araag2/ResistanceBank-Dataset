ABSTRACT

Campylobacter spp. is a leading cause of gastroenteritis in humans. Contaminated food of 

animal origin is considered to be the common source. Some of these bacteria are multi-drug 

resistant, which results in treatment complications. Indiscriminate use of antimicrobial drugs 

has been suggested to be largely responsible for resistance in zoonotic pathogens including 

Campylobacter. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence and antimicrobial 

resistance pattern of Campylobacter isolated from meat of three different food animal species 

sold at retail shops in Lahore, Pakistan. A total of 125 Campylobacter were isolated and 

tested for antimicrobial resistance against nine commonly used antibiotics in veterinary and 

human medicine. The highest resistance was observed against enrofloxacin (79.2%) followed 

by tylosin (77.6%), ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin (71.2% each), colistin (69.6%), neomycin 

(32.8%), nalidixic acid (31.2%), gentamicin (25.6%) and doxycycline (8.8%). Most of the 

isolates (90.4%) were resistant to more than two antibiotics and were considered as multi-

drug resistant bacteria. The results indicate that antibiotic resistant bacteria are prevalent in 

animal meat in Pakistan probably due to uncontrolled use of antibiotics in food animals, thus 

posing a threat to public health.

antibiotic therapy. However, severe cases such as those in immune-compromised patients do 

need to be treated with antibiotics (Engberg, Aarestrup, Taylor, Gerner-Smidt, & Nachamkin, 

2001; Gibreel, et al., 2004) such as fluoroquinolones and macrolides. For bacteremia caused 

by Campylobacter, aminoglycosides are often used (Alfredson & Korolik, 2007; Corcoran, 

Quinn, Cotter, Whyte, & Fanning, 2006; Lin, et al., 2007; Moore, et al., 2006; Payot, et al., 

2006). Unfortunately, the presence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens is a serious 

public health concern throughout the world (Han, Jang, Choo, Heu, & Ryu, 2007; Hawkey & 

Jones, 2009; Isenbarger, et al., 2002). People infected with antibiotic resistant strains of 

Campylobacter are ill for a longer period of time and are more likely to be hospitalized 

(Gupta, et al., 2004). The success rate of treatment against Campylobacter infection is 

decreasing due to an increase in antibiotic resistance (Lehtopolku, et al., 2010). 

Unfortunately, information on antibiotic resistance in Campylobacter of animal origin in 

developing countries is not available (Osano & Arimi, 1999). 

Irrational use of antibiotics for the treatment and control of infectious diseases in 

veterinary medicine is considered a key cause of development of antibiotic resistance in 

foodborne pathogens (Hoszowski & Wasyl, 2005). Most of the antibiotics used in human and 

animal medicine are similar and hence the use of antibiotics in animals poses a potentially 

serious risk to public health (Alfredson & Korolik, 2007; Hariharan, Sharma, Chikweto, 

75 Matthew, & DeAllie, 2009; Luangtongkum, et al., 2009). Recently, the prevalence of 

76

77

78

79

antibiotic resistance in foodborne pathogens has increased and has become a complex issue 

(Možina, Kurinčič, Klančnik, & Mavri, 2011).

Antibiotics are often used as growth promoters in food animals. In developing 

countries, large amounts of various antibiotics are used in domestic poultry for the control of

infectious agents and for growth promotion. This may help select resistant strains and their 

subsequent transmission to humans via contaminated food (Hoszowski & Wasyl, 2005). In 

Pakistan, no data are available on the presence and antimicrobial properties of 

Campylobacter in humans and food animals. The aim of this study was to determine the 

prevalence and antimicrobial resistance patterns of Campylobacter in various meat sources 

(beef, mutton, and chicken) in Lahore, Pakistan.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1 Sampling

A total of 600 meat samples (200 each of beef, mutton, and chicken) were collected from 

retail meat shops from ten administrative divisions of Lahore district in Pakistan from 

September 2014 to February 2015. Most of the meat consumption in Pakistan is in Fall and 

91 Winter. From each division, 20 samples each of beef, mutton and chicken were collected. The

samples were placed in an ice box, transported to the laboratory, and subjected to microbial 

analysis within 24 hrs. of collection.

2.2 Isolation and identification of Campylobacter

Isolation of Campylobacter was carried out according to the international organization for 

standardization ISO 10272-1:2006 (Moran, et al., 2009). Meat samples were placed in 

separate bags and homogenized in a stomacher for 2 minutes with buffered peptone water at 

1/10 ratio of w/v.  An aliquot (1 mL) of this homogenate was transferred to a tube containing 

9 mL of Bolton broth for enrichment. The inoculated Bolton broth was incubated at 42˚C for 

48 hrs under microaerophilic conditions using Campy Gas sachet (Gaspak EZ Campy 

Container BBL 260680) in an anaerobic jar. An aliquot from the enriched broth was streaked 

on plates of mCCDA agar (CM 0739 Oxoid, England) containing cefoperazone and 

amphotericin B (SR0155 Oxoid, England) followed by incubation at 42˚C for 48 hrs under 

104 microaerophilic conditions. Suspected colonies were lifted from plates and identified as 

4

Campylobacter using Gram staining, motility, oxidase test, and latex agglutination (F46 

106 Microgen, UK). These colonies were further streaked on fresh mCCDA plates for purification

and DNA extraction. The purified isolates were also placed in 20% glycerol and stored at-

80˚C for future use. 

2.3 Speciation of Campylobacter

DNA was extracted from purified isolates using “QIAamp DNA Mini Kit” (Qiagen, cat# 

51306, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted DNA was stored at 

-20˚C until used. Multiplex PCR was carried out for confirmation and speciation of 

Campylobacter. Three sets of primers were used to identify Campylobacter spp: C. jejuni, 

and C. coli by targeting 16SrRNA, mapA and cueE gene, respectively (Denis, et al., 1999; 

Gonzalez, Grant, Richardson, Park, & Collins, 1997; Linton, Lawson, Owen, & Stanley, 

1997; Stucki, Frey, Nicolet, & Burnens, 1995). PCR amplification reaction was performed in 

25µL mixture in a thermal cycler “T100” (BioRad USA). The PCR conditions for 35 cycles 

were: denaturation at 94˚C for 1 min, annealing at 48˚C for 1 min and extension at 72˚C for 1 

119 min. The PCR products were visualized under UV light following by gel electrophoresis in 

120

121

122

1.2 % agarose gel.    

2.4 Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Antimicrobial susceptibility tests on 125 isolates were performed by the disc diffusion 

123 method (Bauer et al., 1966). Briefly, three to five well-isolated colonies were selected from 

124

the culture plate. The colonies were suspended in normal saline solution followed by 

adjustment of turbidity to 0.5 McFarland standard. A sterile cotton swab was dipped into the 

suspension and streaked on the entire surface of a Mueller–Hinton agar plate (Oxoid, 

England) containing 5% sheep blood. The inoculum was allowed to dry for 5 min followed 

by application of antibiotic discs and incubation at 420C for 48 hours under microaerophilic 

conditions. Stock cultures of C. jejuni (ATCC 33560) and C. coli (ATCC 33559) were used

as reference strains. The diameters of the zones of inhibition were measured with a calliper 

and interpreted as recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute Guidelines 

(CLSI, 2006). A total of nine antibiotics commonly used in veterinary and human practices 

were tested e.g., amoxicillin (10µg), ciprofloxacin (5µg), colistin (10µg), doxycycline 

(30µg), enrofloxacin (5µg), gentamicin (10µg), nalidixic acid (30µg), neomycin (30µg) and 

tylosin (30µg).

2.5 Statistical Analysis

Data were entered into a Microsoft Excel sheet for analysis and were analysed to obtain the 

numbers and percent of resistant and susceptible microorganisms using SPSS 20.0 statistical 

software.

3. Results

A total of 125 Campylobacter were isolated from the three meat sources of which 82 

were C. jejuni and 43 were C. coli.  Of the 200 beef samples, 31 (15.5%) were positive for 

Campylobacter while this number was 36 (18%) and 58 (29%) for mutton and chicken, 

respectively (Table 1). When tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, the highest resistance in 

all 125 isolates of Campylobacter spp. was against enrofloxacin (79.2%) followed by tylosin 

(77.6%), amoxicillin (71.2%), ciprofloxacin (71.2%), and colistin (69.6%). Most of the 

isolates (113 of 125 or 90.4%) were resistant to multiple antibiotics. The C. jejuni isolates 

(n=82) were highly resistant to enrofloxacin and tylosin (78%) followed by amoxicillin 

(72%), ciprofloxacin (68.3%), and colistin (67%). The rate of resistance against these five 

antibiotics was similar in C. coli isolates (n=43) too. The least resistance was against 

doxycycline (8.8% in Campylobacter spp.).

The overall resistance in Campylobacter isolates (n=31) from beef origin was the 

highest against ciprofloxacin 83.9% (26/31) followed by enrofloxacin 77.4% (24/31) and 

colistin 74.2% (23/31). Resistance against doxycycline, nalidixic acid and neomycin was low.

None of the C. jejuni (n=19) isolates from beef showed any resistance to doxycycline while 2 

of 12 (16.7%) of C. coli isolates were resistant to this antibiotic (Table 2). The resistance of 

C. coli (n=12) to enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and colistin was similar to that in C. jejuni. 

None of the C. coli isolates from beef was resistant to nalidixic acid.

Of the 36 isolates from mutton, 31 (86%) were resistant to tylosin followed by 

enrofloxcin (72.2%) and ciprofloxacin and colistin (66.7% each). Low resistance was 

observed against doxycycline 11% (4/36) and gentamicin 22% (8/36). Of the 36 mutton 

isolates, 25 and 11 were confirmed as C. jejuni and C. coli, respectively. In C. jejuni, the 

highest resistance was against tylosine (21/25 or 84%) followed by enrofloxacin (76%) and 

amoxicillin (72%). Only 8% (2/25) and 20% (5/25) of C. jejuni isolates were resistant to 

doxycycline and neomycin, respectively. For C. coli, the highest resistance was against 

tylosin (10/11 or 91%) and ciprofloxacin (72.7%) and the lowest resistance was against 

doxycycline and gentamicin 18% (2/11 each).

Of the 58 isolates from chicken meat, the highest resistance was against enrofloxacin 

(84%), tylosin (82%), and amoxicillin (82%). Five (8.6%) and 11 (19%) isolates were 

resistant to doxycycline and gentamicin, respectively. Most of the C. jejuni isolates from 

chicken were resistant to tylosin (81.6%), enrofloxacin (79%), and amoxicillin (79%). Only 

four (10.5%) and 10 (26.3%) isolates were resistant to doxycycline and gentamicin, 

respectively. Among C. coli, the highest resistance was observed in enrofloxacin (95%) 

followed by amoxicillin (90%), and tylosin (85%). Sixteen of 20 (80%) isolates were 

resistant to both ciprofloxacin and colistin and only one isolate each (5%) was resistant to 

gentamicin and doxycycline.

The aim of this study was to estimate the burden of Campylobacter spp. in three 

different types of meat sold at retail shops in Lahore district of Pakistan. Another objective 

was to determine the antibiotic resistance of these isolates against commonly used antibiotics. 

The percentage of Campylobacter species isolated from various sources of meat was; 

chicken (29%), mutton (18%) and beef (15.5%). In general, these results are similar to those 

reported previously e.g., the prevalence is greater in chickens than in other animals. For 

example, the overall prevalence of Campylobacter in Pakistan in 2007 was reported to be 

48%, 11%, and 5% in poultry, beef, and mutton, respectively (Hussain, Shahid Mahmood, 

Akhtar, & Khan, 2007). In Turkey, these numbers were 50%, 22% and 11% in chicken, 

187 mutton and beef, respectively (Bostan, Aydin, & Ang, 2009). The results from Iran were

different; the prevalence of Campylobacter was higher in mutton (12%) as compared to beef 

(2.4%) and camel meat (0.9%) (Rahimi, Ameri, & Kazemeini, 2010). The high number of 

Campylobacter in chicken in this study is accepted as normal, since chicken meat is 

considered a primary reservoir for this bacterium. Additionally, the traditional way of 

slaughtering of birds at retail shop and lack of hygienic measures during slaughtering is 

considered to be the potential risk factor in cross contamination. On the other hand, 

slaughtering of beef and mutton is carried out in established slaughterhouses with less 

chances for cross contamination. 

The highest resistance in our study was found against enrofloxacin followed by 

tylosin, amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin. A study from Estonia showed similar results for 

enrofloxacin (73.3%) in Campylobacter isolates from poultry (Roasto, et al., 2007). The 

highest resistance in Campylobacter isolates from  Spain, Poland and Latvia was also against 

200 macrolides (Kovaļenko, Roasto, Šantare, Bērziņš, & Hörman, 2014; Maćkiw, Korsak, 

201

202

Rzewuska, Tomczuk, & Rożynek, 2012). These results are comparable to a study on resistant 

Campylobacter isolates from layer chickens in two different farming systems in the United

States. Resistance against tylosin in conventional farming system was higher (34%) than 

organic farming system (25%). Additionally 66% and 46.3% of the isolates were resistant 

from CF-1 (Conventional Farm-1) and OF-1 (Organic Farm-1), respectively (Kassem, et al., 

2017). . This is not surprising because tylosin has not been used as a growth promotor in 

poultry from January 1999 onwards in these countries (European Food Safety, 2010). Still 

this antibiotic is frequently used in broiler industry in Pakistan. In another study 38.7% of 

Campylobacter isolates from pigs, dairy and beef cattle were resistant to tylosin in Tanzania 

(Kashoma, et al., 2015). During 2007 to 2009 in northern Greece, Campylobacter spp. was 

found resistant to tetracycline, streptomycin, ciprofloxacin, and nalidixic acid and but they 

were susceptible to gentamicin and erythromycin (Lazou, Houf, Soultos, Dovas, & 

Iossifidou, 2014).

In our study, 71.2% of the isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin. These results are 

similar to studies in Algiers and Poland where the resistance to this antibiotic was 83.7 and 

66.3% isolates from broiler and chicken meat, respectively (Andrzejewska, Szczepańska, 

Śpica, & Klawe, 2015; Messad, Hamdi, Bouhamed, Ramdani-Bouguessa, & Tazir, 2014). 

The rise in prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistant Campylobacter in retail poultry meat has 

also been reported from Denmark (Andersen, et al., 2006), Spain, Germany, Italy, Holland 

and Austria (Maćkiw, et al., 2012). In Latvia and Estonia, 60% of Campylobacters isolated 

from slaughterhouses were resistant to ciprofloxacin (Kovaļenko, et al., 2014; Roasto, et al., 

2007). The resistance to fluoroquinolones in Campylobacter is believed to be due to the use 

of this antibiotic for treatment purposes in food animals (Talsma, Goettsch, Nieste, 

Schrijnemakers, & Sprenger, 1999).

The resistance to nalidixic acid was not high perhaps because this antibiotic is not 

used extensively in veterinary practice in Pakistan. These results are different from those in 

Latvia and Estonia where 75.6% and 60% of the isolates from slaughterhouses were resistant, 

9

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT228

229

230

respectively. In Denmark, the resistance against nalidixic acid was high among the isolates 

from duck and turkey meat (12%) as compared to chicken meat (7.4%) (Andersen et al., 

2006; Kovaļenko et al., 2014; Roasto et al., 2007). In Iran, 54% of the isolates from various 

231 meat types were resistant to nalidixic acid (Rahimi & Ameri, 2011). The authors suggested 

232

233

234

235

that this was due to the widespread use of antibiotics in prophylaxis and growth promotion 

(Rahimi & Ameri, 2011). All 19 (100%) C. coli isolates from ducks in Malaysia were 

resistant to nalidixic acid and norfloxacin while 79 (84%) and 75 (80%) of C. jejuni isolates 

were resistant to nalidixic acid and enrofloxacin, respectively (Adzitey, Rusul, Huda, Cogan, 

236 & Corry, 2012).

Overall resistance to gentamicin was low (25.6%) in our study, which could be related 

to the infrequent use of this antibiotic in poultry production because of its high cost. In 

Grenada, no resistance was seen against gentamicin in Campylobacter isolates from poultry 

(Hariharan, et al., 2009). Similarly, there was no resistance against gentamicin in isolates 

from small ruminants in Greece (Lazou, et al., 2014). The resistance to gentamicin in chicken 

isolates was low in Northern Ireland and Poland (6.3% and 5%, respectively). The low 

resistance may be attributed to the fact that gentamicin is rarely used in poultry as growth 

promotant.  Gentamicin is used by  subcutaneous or intramuscular administration which is 

labor intensive  (Rodrigo, Adesiyun, Asgarali, & Swanston, 2007; Wilson, 2003).

The resistance against doxycycline was also low in this study; only 11 of 125 isolates 

were resistant. These results are in contrast to those from Poland, Spain, Latvia, Denmark and 

France where 79%-90% Campylobacters showed resistance to tetracycline. The difference in 

occurrence of antimicrobial resistance reflects different national practices (Andersen, et al., 

2006; Kovaļenko, et al., 2014; Maćkiw, et al., 2012). Similarly, high resistance (70.6%) to 

tetracycline was observed in Campylobacter isolates from various meat types in Iran

(Talsma, et al., 1999), In Greece 48% of Campylobacter isolates from small ruminant 

slaughterhouses were resistant to tetracycline (Lazou, et al., 2014). 

In the present study, resistance against enrofloxacin, amoxicillin and tylosin was high 

in isolates from chicken. Similarly, the highest level of resistance was in Campylobacter 

isolates from retail poultry meat in Denmark during 1996-2003 and it  was against 

tetracycline, nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin (Andersen, et al., 2006). In Latvia, during 2010, 

high resistance was against ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid (Kovalenko K, 2014). The high 

resistance against antibiotics in this study is probably due to irrational use of antibiotic in 

poultry practice in Pakistan. 

Our study indicated highest resistance against ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin and colistin 

in isolates from beef origin. Other studies concluded that Campylobacter spp. isolated from 

cattle slaughterhouses were frequently resistant to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin (38.3%), 

followed by streptomycin (24.3%) and tetracycline (20.9%) in Poland (Wieczorek, Denis, 

Lynch, & Osek, 2013).

A total of 90.4% of the isolates were MDR (multi-drug resistant) from different 

sources of meat. All Campylobacter isolates (100%) from broiler farms and slaughterhouses 

were identified as MDR in Algiers (Messad, et al., 2014).  In China, 86% of the isolates from 

poultry were MDR (Chen, et al., 2010), while in Latvia it was 67.2% (Kovaļenko, et al., 

2014), in Trinidad 64% (Rodrigo, et al., 2007), in Korea 56.5% (Han, et al., 2007) and in Iran 

44.9% (Ebrahim Rahimi & Ameri, 2011).

5. Conclusions

It is concluded that Campylobacter spp. are circulating in various meat sources in Pakistan. 

The high resistance seen in our isolates is a serious health issue and may pose a risk in human
