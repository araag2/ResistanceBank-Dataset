An investigation of Mastitis in cattle was carried out in Anand city and in nearby villages of
Gujarat state using California Mastitis Test (CMT) kit. The prevalence of clinical and
subclinical mastitis was found to be 5.5% and 15.75%, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus
was identiÔ¨Åed through strain speciÔ¨Åc polymerase chain reaction; the remaining isolates
identiÔ¨Åed on the basis of molecular analysis by 16S rDNA sequencing and phylogenetic
analysis were Staphylococcus species, B. pumilus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Bacillus
species, and Pseudomonas species. In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of all the iso-
lates was checked against 13 different antibiotics using the agar disc diffusion method.
Highest bacterial resistance was observed with penicillin G and oxacillin antibiotics. It
was also observed that the patterns of bacterial resistance have not changed in India over
the years. The data supports the decrease in the incidence of mastitis but the rate of
decrease is minimal. More effective control strategies are required.

Mastitis is derived from masto, referring to the mammary gland, and itis, meaning
inÔ¨Çammation. Mastitis describes an inÔ¨Çammatory reaction in the mammary gland
(1). Recognized worldwide as one of the costliest diseases affecting dairy herds, it
reduces the milk yield and quality of milk and increases rate of culling and veterinary
expenses. On the basis of habitat of pathogen, mastitis is classiÔ¨Åed as one of the fol-
lowing: (A) contagious mastitis, which is caused by contagious bacteria living on the
skin of the teat and inside the udder, transmitted from one cow to another during
milking (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus agalactiae) and (B) environ-
mental mastitis, which is caused by environmental pathogens normally found in

the cow‚Äôs surroundings such as bedding, manure, soil, and feed (e.g., Escherichia coli,
Streptococcus uberis, Klebsiella sp.) (2).

A total of 137 microbial species, subspecies, and serovars have been isolated
from the bovine mammary gland (3). In 1982, screening of crossbreed cows belong-
ing to the Gujarat Agricultural University farms recorded 91.66% incidence of
mastitis (4). Sources indicate 80% to 99% of all mastitis infections are caused by four
types of organisms: Staphylococcal, S. agalactiae, other Streptococcal species, and
Coliforms (5, 6).

It has been reported that the most common causes of udder disease include
Staphylococci (S.aureus and S. epidermidis), Streptococci (S. agalactiae, Streptococ-
cus dysgalactiae, S. uberis, and Streptococcus bovis), and Coliforms (mainly E. coli
and Klebsiella pneumoniae) (7). Other etiological agents less frequently encountered
include Pseudomonads, Nocardia, Mycoplasmas, and Yeast. In many countries the
most common bacterial species causing mastitis are S. aureus, S. dysgalactiae, and
S. uberis (8). Many workers have reported S.aureus as the most predominant mastitis
agent of subclinical intramammary infection (9‚Äì11). E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and
Enterobacter aerogenes are the most common coliforms in bovine mastitis (12).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample Collection

A total of 400 quarter samples were diagnosed as subclinical mastitis using the
California Mastitis Test (CMT) (13). The milk samples were obtained from the cattle
farms of Anand city and in nearby villages of Gujarat state, India. Milk samples
from the infected cattle were collected aseptically in sterile wide mouth glass stopper
bottles. Before sample collection the udder was thoroughly washed with potassium
permanganate solution (1:1000) and the teats were mopped with 70% ethyl alcohol.

Isolation and Enrichment of Microorganisms

Milk sample (0.1 mL) was spread on 5% sheep blood agar (SBA) plates and
incubated at 37C for 24‚Äì48 h. The colonies showing Ô¨Åne hemolytic zone were selec-
ted and puriÔ¨Åed. For enrichment of bacterial strains, 250 mL Ô¨Çasks containing
100 mL nutrient culture medium were inoculated with a single isolated colony of bac-
teria and incubated at 37C on a rotary shaker (150 rpm) for overnight. Stable
enrichment cultures were obtained after subculture.

In Vitro Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing

Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of all the isolates were checked using
agar disc diffusion method against 13 different antibiotics: streptomycin (10 mcg=
disc), lincomycin (10 mcg=disc), amoxicillin (10 mcg=disc), ampicillin (10 mcg=disc),
trimethoprim (5 mcg=disc), oxacillin (30 mcg=disc), nalidixic acid (30 mcg=
disc), oxytetracycline (1 mcg=disc), amikacin (10 mcg=disc), penicillin-G (10 mcg=
disc), erythromycin (15 mcg=disc), tetracycline (30 mcg=disc), and gentamicin

(10 mcg=disc). The sensitivity was measured in terms of the diameter of the zone of
inhibition surrounding the disc.

Molecular Characterization

DNA was extracted (14) from all the isolates and 100 ng of the genomic DNA
was used to perform 16S rDNA PCR and strain speciÔ¨Åc (S. aureus) PCR using the
speciÔ¨Åc primers (15, 16). PCR product obtained was sent to Bangalore Genei
Services, Bangalore for partial length sequencing of 16S rDNA.

RESULT AND DISCUSSION

Out of 400 quarter samples, 85 (21.25%) were found infected, 22 (5.5%) showed

clinical symptoms, and 63 (15.75%) were subclinically infected.

Given the fact that bacteria are responsible for the majority of the cases of
mastitis, it is important to identify the genus and species of bacteria to apply effective
disease control strategies and effective drug design.

For phylogenetic studies, the 16S rDNA gene was used. Universal primers were
used to amplify the 16S rDNA gene providing the phylogenetic information (17).
One isolate was identiÔ¨Åed as S. aureus by performing species speciÔ¨Åc PCR (16).
The 16S rDNA products (product size 1.5 kb) (Fig. 1) of the rest of the isolates were
sequenced and identiÔ¨Åed with NCBI Gene bank RDP-II database as Staphylococcus
sp., B. pumilus, S. chromogenes, Bacillus sp., and Pseudomonas sp., Genbank acces-
sion numbers are HM234035, HM234036, HM234033, HM234034, and HM234037,
respectively.
ConÔ¨Ådence in phylogenetic analysis was assessed by Hillis and Bull (18) who
stated that the bootstrap value of 70% usually corresponds to a probability of
 95% that the corresponding clade is real. The species included in the present
study were initially separated into clades by analyzing the entire dataset by
neighbor-joining and by a simple heuristic search from maximum parsimony.

Sequences of the above isolates were aligned with sequences retrieved from the NCBI
database and the relatedness of isolates to other organisms was determined by a
phylogenetic tree based on two data sets (Fig. 2).

Out of the 12 isolates, 4 were resistant to at least three antibiotics and 2 were
resistant to one antibiotic. A pattern of resistance against penicillin G, oxacillin, and
trimethoprim was recorded in 2 isolates, while 1 isolate was slightly different with
lincomycin resistance instead of trimethoprim. The remaining 2 isolates were resist-
ant to nalidixic acid (Table 1). The adaptation might be due to prolonged treatment
with these antibiotics in a particular area. These strains may have plasmid=s bearing
the gene that imparts this resistance. Due to antibacterial usage over many decades,

multiple drug resistance among the mastitis causing agents is a major problem in
controlling intramammary infections. This is generally attributed to indiscriminate
use of antibacterial drugs without prior drug susceptibility testing. Such antimicro-
bial resistant organisms can pose serious health related problems to animals as well
as human beings.

The proportion of S. aureus isolated that were susceptible to ampicillin, ery-
thromycin, and penicillin increased, whereas the annual proportion that were suscep-
tible to cephalothin, ceftiofur, gentamicin, oxacillin, pirlimycin, sulfa-trimethoprim,
and tetracycline did not change. The proportion of susceptible isolates to these anti-
bacterials was consistently >95% (19). Antibiotic control programs have proved to
be an effective way to reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics in hospitals. Such pro-
grams are sorely needed in the community, particularly in residence facilities for the
elderly. The need for new antibiotics will continue because bacteria have a remark-
able ability to overcome each new agent synthesized. Appropriate use of antibiotics
will delay and in many cases prevent the emergence of the resistance.

In the present area of survey, gentamicin, enroÔ¨Çoxacin, ciproÔ¨Çoxacin, and
chloramphenicol are not commonly used for treatment of mastitis, resulting in
higher efÔ¨Åcacy of these drugs. In India, agents causing mastitis were found to show
the highest sensitivity to enroÔ¨Çoxacin (20, 21) and chloramphenicol (22) and the least
sensitivity to ampicillin (20) and cloxacillin (20). Similar antibiogram patterns were
also reported in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra states of India (23, 24), while
Anakalo et al. (24) reported Staphylococcus aureus and Coagulase Negative Sta-
phylococcus (CNS) as the major mastitis inducing pathogens, which is suggestive
of a possible development of resistance from prolonged and indiscriminate use of
beta-lactam antibiotics..

Ampicillin, penicillin, streptomycin, and oxytetracycline are commonly used
antibiotics in bovine mastitis in the area of survey. The mastitic bacteria showed
resistance to these commonly used antibiotics due to the frequent use of these
antibiotics. Since Streptomycin has been extensively used along with Penicillin for
treating mastitis, it may have led to the development of higher resistance in bacteria
against these antibiotics.

The prevalence of clinical and subclinical mastitis were found to be 5.5% and
15.75%, respectively. Systematic records regarding the epidemiology of bovine mas-
titis including status of infection, antibiogram studies, and treatment patterns would
provide useful management information to the producer, farmer, and veterinarian.
Thus, there is a need to routinely investigate and record the epidemiology of bovine
mastitis and antibiogram sensitivity of bacterial isolates in various parts of India.
The data support a decrease in incidence of mastitis but the rate of decrease is
minimal. More effective control strategies are required.
