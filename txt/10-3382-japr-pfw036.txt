SUMMARY

Increasing emergence of salmonellosis presents a threat to the effective control of foodborne
disease in humans. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of drug susceptibility
and molecular characteristics of non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) isolated from laying hens
(LH) in 3 Moroccan regions, Rabat-Sal´e-Zemmour-Za¨er (RSZZ), Souss-Massa-Drˆaa (SMD),
and the grand Casablanca (GC). A total of 351 samples were collected from 30 consumer
egg laying houses at the end of the egg laying period from April to July 2011. Sixty-four out
of these 351 examined samples were contaminated by Salmonella. The Salmonella isolated
strains were then serotyped and tested for drug susceptibility and analyzed by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of the invasion-associated genes invA and spvC and
nalidixic acid resistance-associated qnr gene. The prevalence of NTS infection in LH was
estimated to be 73.3%. Seven Salmonella enterica serovars were identified: Enteritidis (37.5%),
Kentucky (31.2%), Infantis (10.9%), Typhimurium (6.2%), Thompson (6.2%), Agona (4.6%),
and Amsterdam (3.1%). Drug susceptibility testing showed that 65.6% of Salmonella were
resistant to at least one antibiotic and 25% were resistant to ciprofloxacin. All isolates were
positive for the invasion gene invA and 28% of them were positive for the virulence gene spvC.
All nalidixic acid-resistant S. Enteritidis isolates were negative for qnr plasmid genes. Our
findings clearly suggest the necessity to establish an NTS monitoring and control program for
LH in Morocco.

infection. Intensive epidemiology and laboratory
investigations identified shell eggs as the major
vehicle for Salmonella Enteritidis infection in
humans, and they reported that eggs had been
internally contaminated by transovarian trans-
mission of Salmonella Enteritidis in the LH [1].
Food poisoning caused by Salmonella is often as-
sociated with consumption of eggs and/or other
foods that use eggs as a component. Most of the
time, infected LH are at the origin of these in-
fections [2]. According to a survey conducted in
the United States, each year 31 major pathogens
cause 9.4 million episodes of foodborne illness,
most of which are caused by norovirus (58%)
followed by non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS)
(11%), although NTS was found to be the leading
cause of hospitalization (35%) and death (28%)
[3]. NTS was also found to be involved in ap-
proximately 65% of collective food poisoning
cases in France [4]. In Morocco, Salmonella,
Staphylococcus aureus, andClostridium perfrin-
gens were reported to be responsible for, re-
spectively, 42.8, 37, and 1.7% of food poisoning
cases in humans [5]. Of the 1,577 cases of epi-
demic food poisoning reported annually in Mo-
rocco, Salmonella was confirmed in 96 cases,
and suspected in 259 cases [6]. It is reported
worldwide that all Salmonella serotypes (not
only S. Typhi) show resistance to drugs [7]. In
Morocco,
resistance to quinolone and car-
bapenem was commonly detected in S. Ken-
tucky, while S. Typhimurium showed a high
level of resistance to the third generation of
cephalosporin [8,9]. Currently, there are lim-
ited data on the prevalence of Salmonella
in LH breeding in Morocco. The aim of
this work was to evaluate the prevalence
of NTS serotypes, antimicrobial susceptibil-

ity, and detection of invA and spvC genes
in Salmonella isolates collected on LH farms
in Morocco.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Materials

Laying hen farms were randomly selected
from a list of LH units authorized in Morocco
gratefully provided by the National Office of
Health Security of Food Products (ONSSA) (204
farms). Hens were aged between 14 to 83 wk
old. Animals did not show any signs of dis-
ease (in particular diarrhea) and they were not
subject to any antibiotic treatment during the
phase of egg production. Samples were collected
from LH groups that were at the end of the
egg laying period (between 74 and 82 wk old).
The geographical location and the importance
of the LH farm density were taken into con-
sideration. Four big regions were identified in
Morocco (Table 1). However, due to time con-
straints, samples were collected only from farms
in the 3 biggest and most populated regions in
Morocco, Grand Casablanca (GC), Rabat-Sal´e-
Zemmour-Za¨er (RSZZ), and the Souss-Massa-
Drˆaa (SMD). A total of 351 samples were col-
lected from April to July 2011, from 30 visited
LH farms (Table 2). Twelve LH farms were vis-
ited in RSZZ, a region located in the northwest
coastal region of Morocco. This region includes
the capital city and its outskirts (over 9,580 km2,
with a population of about 2,676,754 inhabi-
tants). A total of 150 samples were collected
from these LH farms [60 fresh dropping samples,
24 dust samples (i.e., samples collected from

poultry house), 12 pooled cloacal swab samples,
12 food samples, 12 water samples, and 30 dead
animal organs (liver, spleen, oviduct, and ceca)]
from April to July 2011. Ten LH farms were se-
lected in the GC, a region considered as being
the most densely populated region in the coun-
try. It is located in the northwest of Morocco and
covers 1,615 km2 with 4,270,750 inhabitants. A
total of 88 samples were collected from these LH
farms [40 fresh dropping samples, 16 dust sam-
ples, 8 pooled cloacal swab samples, 8 food sam-
ples, 8 water samples, and 8 dead animal organs
(liver, spleen, oviduct, and ceca)] from April to
July 2011. In the third studied region, SMD, lo-
cated in the south of Morocco, 8 LH farms were
visited. This region includes the Souss Valley, a
part of the anti-atlas mountains and the region of
Ouarzazate. It covers an area of 70,880 km2 and
has a population of 3,113,653 inhabitants. A to-
tal of 113 samples were collected from these LH
farms [50 fresh dropping samples, 20 dust sam-
ples, 10 pooled cloacal swab samples, 10 food
samples, 10 water samples, and 13 dead animal
organs (liver, spleen, oviduct, and ceca)] from
April to July 2011.

Isolation and Identification of Salmonella

(NF U 47-100)

The isolation and microbiological characteri-
zation of Salmonella were performed according
to “Association Franc¸aise de Normalisation”
(AFNOR)
[10]. Suspected
colonies were subjected to oxidase and urease
tests, followed by bacterial identification using
the API 20E systems (Bio M´erieux R SA, Marcy-
l’Etoile, France). The molecular confirmation
of Salmonella strains was performed by ampli-
fication of the 275-bp fragment of the invA gene
(Accession number M90846.1) using the primer
pair: Forward (5
) and
) [11]. The
reverse (5
amplification program consisted of an initial
denaturation at 95
C for one min followed by 30
C for 30 sec, and
cycles of 95
C for
72
10 minutes. The PCR product was then analyzed
by electrophoresis on agarose gel and visual-
ized under ultraviolet
transillumination after
ethidium bromide staining. An extracted DNA

Salmonella Strains Serotyping

Salmonella isolates serotyping was per-
formed using the slide agglutination test with
specific antisera raised against “0” and “H”
antigens of Salmonella (BioRad, Marnes-La-
Coquette, France). Salmonella enterica serotype
was determined according to the White-
Kauffmann-Le Minor classification scheme
[12].

Drug Susceptibility Testing

Antibiotic susceptibility testing was per-
formed using the disc diffusion method on
Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) and results were in-
terpreted according to the EUCAST breakpoints
(Committee of the French Society for Micro-
biology (CA-SFM)). The strains were screened
for their resistance to the following antibi-
otics (Bio-Rad): Amoxicillin, Amx 25 μg; ce-
falotin, Cf 30 μg; amoxicillin-clavulanic acid,
Amc 20 + 10 μg; cefoxitin, Fox 30 μg; ce-
fotaxime, Ctx 30 μg; ceftriaxone, Cro 5 μg;
ceftazidime, Caz 30 μg; chloramphenicol, C
30 μg; streptomycin, S 10 μg; gentamycin,
Gm 30 μg; trimethoprime, Tmp 5 μg; sul-
fonamids, Sul 200 μg; nalidixic acid, Na
30 μg and ciprofloxacin, Cip 5 μg. E. coli
ATCC 25922 was used as a quality control
strain.

Plasmid Extraction

Plasmid DNA extraction was performed by
a rapid alkaline lysis procedure [13]. The plas-
mid DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis on a
0.75% (w/v) agarose gel after running in 0.5×
TBE buffer [10 mM Tris, 0.4 mM Boric Acid
and 1.0 mM EDTA (pH8)] at 50 mA (120 volts)
for 2 h at room temperature and then visualized
by UV illumination. Plasmid extract from Es-
cherichia coli V517 strain carrying 8 plasmids
(54 kb, 7.2 kb, 5.6 kb, 5.l kb, 3.9 kb, 3.0 kb,
2.7 kb and 2.1 kb) was used as a molecular weight
marker.

SpvC Genes Detection

The DNA of Salmonella isolates was pre-
pared by the boiling method. Approximately a

◦

loopful of culture was taken from tryptic soy agar
◦
cultures (18 to 24 h at 37
C) and placed in sterile
microcentrifuge tubes containing 100 μ L of ster-
ilized DNAse-free and RNAse-free milliQ water
(Millipore, Bedford, MA), vortexed, and sam-
C for 10 minutes. Cell
ples were heated at 100
debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000
× g for 15 min and 2.5 μL of the supernatant
was used as a DNA template in polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) mixture. PCR was per-
formed with one set of specific primer pairs: For-
(cid:4)
ward (5
-
cccaaacccatacttactctg-3
), for the invasion gene
spvC; this primer pair was predicted to yield
a 669-bp product [11]. PCR products were re-
solved by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gel
and visualized under ultraviolet transillumina-
tion after ethidium bromide staining. Salmonella
Typhimurium ATCC14028 and E. coli HB101
were used as positive and negative controls,
respectively.

Plasmid qnr Genes (A, B, and S) Detection

All Salmonella Enteritidis nalidixic acid-
resistant isolates were analyzed by multiplex-
PCR to detect the presence of plasmid qnr genes
(A, B, and S) associated with quinolone resis-
tance as described previously [14].

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Prevalence of Salmonella

A farm is considered infected if Salmonella
is isolated from at least one collected sample.
In this study, 76.7% (23/30) of the visited farms
were contaminated by Salmonella. The high con-
tamination rate by Salmonella is comparable to
the prevalence found in some European coun-
tries, such as Spain (73.2%), Portugal (79.5%),
and Poland (77.2%) [15]. The contamination rate
of the visited farms was: 100% (10/10) in GC,
87.5% (7/8) in SMD, and 50% (6/12) in RSZZ.
The PCR of the invA gene has been recognized
as an international standard for the detection of
the genus. Therefore, this method is a power-
ful tool for an efficient Salmonella diagnosis
[16]. Of the total of 351 samples collected from
the 30 visited LH farms, 18.2% (64/351) were

contaminated by Salmonella (Table 2). Our re-
sults further showed the presence of the invA
gene in all Salmonella isolated from LH in Mo-
rocco. This finding was consistent with previous
reports [17] that established the presence of invA
gene in nearly all Salmonella strains irrespective
of serovar or source.

Our study further showed that the highest
contamination rate by Salmonella was found
in dropping samples (61%), followed by dust
samples (18%), food samples (12.5%), cloa-
cal swabs (4.6%), and water samples (3.1%)
(Table 2). All dead animal organs analyzed for
Salmonella were, however, found negative. This
high frequency of Salmonella may be due to ap-
plied biosecurity measures (no showering and/or
changing facilities for visitors and staff entering
poultry houses were available) and the absence
of quality control of drinking water in the visited
farms.

resistant
to 2 or more antimicrobial agents.
Salmonella Kentucky showed the highest level
of resistance (25%) to the different tested drugs,
followed by Salmonella Typhimurium (4.6%).
These data were comparable to previous data
[11]. Salmonella Enteritidis showed 37.5% of
resistance only to nalidixic acid. This result was
in accordance with previous data [18]. The re-
maining serotypes, Amsterdam, Agona, and In-
fantis, were sensitive to all tested antibiotics. It
is, however, noteworthy that all visited regions
were contaminated by S. Kentucky strains resis-
tant to ciprofloxacin. This result is in agreement
with those of a recent epidemiological investiga-
tion conducted in France [19]. National health,
food, and agricultural authorities should include
Salmonella Kentucky resistant to ciprofloxacin
among the strains targeted in national programs
to control Salmonella in poultry.

Serotype of Salmonella

Plasmids

Among 64 Salmonella isolates and accord-
ing to the Kauffmann-White scheme described
previously, 7 different serotypes were identi-
fied. The serotype distribution was as follows:
Enteritidis 37.5% (24/64), Kentucky 31.3%
(20/64), Infantis 10.9% (7/64), Typhimurium
6.2% (4/64), Thompson 6.2% (4/64), Agona
4.7% (3/64), and Amsterdam 3.l % (2/64)
(Table 2). Our results showed a predominance of
Enteritidis serotype, although this remains lower
than that found in LH breeding in the European
Community (57.5%) in 2002 [15].

Resistance to the Antimicrobial Agents

As shown in (Table 2), antibiotic resis-
tance of the isolated Salmonella strains to 14
antimicrobial agents showed a high percent-
age of resistance to the following antimicro-
bial agents: Nalidixic acid (61%), ciprofloxacin
(25%), amoxicillin (21%), tetracyc1in (25%),
cefalotin (25%), streptomycin (18%), sulfon-
amides (14%), and gentamycin (8%). Forty-
two strains out of 64 (65.6%) were resistant
to at least one tested antimicrobial agent. Fur-
thermore, a high prevalence of multiresistance
among Salmonella strains was observed. In
fact, 19 out of 64 Salmonella strains were

The Salmonella isolated showed different
plasmid profiles with plasmid sizes ranging from
2.1 to 54 kb. Seventeen isolates of Salmonella
did not show any plasmids, while 47 strains
(73.5%) were carrying plasmids (2.1 to 54 kb).
All nalidixic acid-resistant strains of Salmonella
Enteritidis were found to carry one plasmid
(54 kb) (Table 2). Several investigators reported
that resistance to different antimicrobial agents
was mediated by a large plasmid [11]. This plas-
mid whose size is greater than or equal to 90 kb
was not found in our study.

Occurrence of spvC Gene

The detection of spvC invasion-associated
gene by PCR showed that 78% (18/23) of S.
Enteritidis resistant to nalidixic acid were found
positive for spvC, while the other serotypes in
our collection were negative (Table 2). The spvC
gene is probably located on the plasmid (∼54 kb)
(Table 2). Similar data were reported for minced
turkey meat in Casablanca [11]. Abouzeed and
collaborators showed that the spvC gene was de-
tected in 7 human isolates but was not detected
in chicken or bovine isolates [17].

Plasmid qnr Genes (A, B, and S) Detection

As the qnr gene is known to confer a low
level of resistance to both quinolones and fluo-
roquinolones, all of the 23 S. Enteritidis resis-
tant to nalidixic acid were subjected to multiplex
qnr PCR amplification and were found negative.
This finding may be due to other mechanisms
such as chromosomal mutations of quinolone
resistance determining region (QRDR) of the
DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. It is, how-
ever, interesting to note that a recent study re-
ported the presence of the plasmid qnrS gene
in Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneu-
moneae isolated from humans at Ibn-Rochd
Hospital-Casablanca [14].

CONCLUSION AND APPLICATIONS

1. In this study, the prevalence of NTS infec-
tion on LH farms was estimated to be 73.3%.
2. Seven Salmonella enterica serovars were
identified: Enteritidis (37.5%), Kentucky
(31.2%), Infantis (10.9%), Typhimurium
(6.2%), Thompson (6.2%), Agona (4.6%),
and Amsterdam (3.1%).

3. In this study, 65.6% of Salmonella strains
were resistant to at least one antibiotic,
and 28% (18/64) of them were positive for
the spvC invasion-associated gene, probably
carried by a plasmid (54 Kb).

4. This study showed an impressive im-
plant of the S. Kentucky resistant to the
ciprofloxacin on all visited farms.

5. In light of these findings, we recommend
the establishment of a strategy to improve
the current situation by the implementation
of a surveillance and control program of
Salmonella on LH farms and extending
the collected samples (from breeding to
fresh droppings and samples of dust). This
will provide more data for conducting
risk analysis with relevance to human and
animal health.
