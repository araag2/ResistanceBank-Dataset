1Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology, (2014) 32(4): 425-429The treatment and clinical management of Campylobacteriosis in man is adversely affected due to the escalating rates of antibiotic resistance.[5] This is because antimicrobial resistance prolongs the infection and causes further complications in patients with bacteraemia. Infections due to antimicrobial resistant enteric bacteria are highest in the developing world, where the use of antimicrobial drugs in humans and animals is relatively unrestricted.[6] The unregulated use of antimicrobial agents in food animal production has led to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance among Campylobacter spp. After the approval and thereafter the subsequent use of fluoroquinolones	in	poultry	in	Europe	and	USA,	there	was	an	increase	in	fluoroquinolone	resistance	in	Campylobacter spp. from animals and human patients.[7]The epidemiology of Campylobacter in broiler production is not wholly understood to date. There is a difference of opinion over, which are the main sources for flock	colonisation.[8] The transmission of Campylobacter occurs	in	the	flock,	after	original	introduction	of	the	organism into that group and as intra-intestinal colonisation of its members commences.[9] Two types of transmission have	been	pursued	by	researchers.	The	first	is	vertical	transmission from parent chicken to progeny. The second being horizontal transmission from external sources such as feed, water, domestic animals, insects, rodents and wild	birds	to	chicken.	Carryover	from	previous	flocks	and	horizontal transmission via contaminated water, domestic and wild animals, personnel working in the broiler house, and the external environment has been implicated.[10,11] Vertical transmission from Campylobacter-positive breeder flocks	via	the	egg	to	their	progeny	has	not	been	found	to	be	very likely.[12] Therefore, based on preceding substantiation, and because, investigations on bacteriological, pathological, clinical, and epidemiological aspects of Campylobacters IntroductionCampylobacter jejuni and C. coli are the most commonly reported bacterial causes of acute gastroenteritis in humans in both developing and developed countries.[1] Campylobacters may cause a spectrum of illness in humans. The signs manifested by the patients include abdominal cramping and diarrhoea. Other extra intestinal diseases may result from Campylobacter infections including bacteraemia, endocarditis, meningitis, urinary tract infection (UTI), and Guillain-Barré syndrome, which are the acute paralytic diseases of the peripheral nervous system.The most important sources of Campylobacter infections for humans are associated with poultry.[1] Various studies have demonstrated high levels of Campylobacter on broiler chickens from poultry farms[2] and on retail chickens.[3] The presence of Campylobacter in the agricultural context has widely been documented in scientific	literature;	however,	there	are	few	reports	for	the	same from India.[4]*Corresponding author (email: <bpkapadnis@yahoo.com>)Department of Microbiology (SP, BK), Institute of Bioinformatics and Biotechnology (DS), University of Pune, Ganeshkhind, Pune-411 007, Maharashtra, India Received: 04-09-2013 Accepted: 27-03-2014Access this article onlineQuick Response Code:Website: www.ijmm.orgPMID: ***DOI: 10.4103/0255-0857.142259Prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of thermophilic Campylobacters from sources implicated in horizontal transmission of flock colonisationS Parkar, D Sachdev, *B KapadnisAbstractThermophilic Campylobacter are commonly associated with poultry as commensals of the avian gut and are the causative agent responsible for human Campylobacteriosis. This study aimed to establish the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. from environmental sources that have previously been implicated as sources of horizontal transmission. The highest prevalence of thermophilic Campylobacter was found in water samples (87.5%) and lowest from	flies	(7.2%).	Only	C. jejuni was isolated from all sources. A secondary aim was to provide a baseline of resistance profiles	of	Campylobacter spp. isolates obtained. Alarmingly all the C. jejuni isolates from environmental sources as well as humans were multi-drug resistant.Key words: Antibiotic resistance, campylobacter, horizontal transmissionBrief Communicationwww.ijmm.org426Indian Journal of Medical Microbiologyvol. 32, No. 4in India are moderately recent, the present study was undertaken to determine frequency of occurrence of pathogenic Campylobacters in the farm environment and to determine antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the isolates.Materials and MethodsDuring the study, 233 samples were collected from poultry farms and from several retail establishments located in Pune, India [Table 1]. Samples were collected from different wild birds and animals, poultry chickens, rodents, humans,	water,	soil,	and	flies.	These	were	examined	for	presence of Campylobacter spp. All the samples were transported to the laboratory under refrigerated conditions, and microbiological analyses were carried out immediately. The poultry birds were sampled non-invasively in that there was	no	entry	into	the	body	cavity	of	the	birds.	All	scientific	ethical practices were respected. In this study, fresh faecal, cloacal swabs and feather swabs each were collected from the poultry chickens. Faecal samples were collected from wild birds in and around the poultry farm using a reported protocol.[13] The rectal contents were collected from rodents and analysed by reported protocol.[14] Flies and treated drinking water in the farm area were analysed using the protocol by Khalil et al., (1994).[15] Litter samples were obtained from poultry broiler house.For analysis of samples from humans and rodents about	0.5	g	of	rectal	contents/faeces	were	directly	plated	on	modified	charcoal	cefoperazone	deoxycholate	agar (mCCDA) plates.[14] This was followed by incubation at 42 ± 1°C for 48 h under the microaerobic conditions.The swabs were transported in sterile Preston enrichment broth (PEB). Campylobacter was isolated from	collected	flies	by	dissecting	them	vertically	and	horizontally into four pieces followed by addition of each fly	to	5	ml	sterile	PEB.	Water	was	filtered	through	0.45	µm millipore	filters.	The	filter	was	removed	and	added	to	50	ml	sterile PEB. Preston Campylobacter selective enrichment broth (PEB) (HiMedia, Mumbai India) was supplemented with selective supplement (HiMedia, Mumbai India) containing	polymyxin	B	(5	IU/ml),	rifampicin	(10	µg/ml),	trimethoprim 10 (µg/ml)	and	cycloheximide	(100	µg/ml)	along with 10% horse blood (Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Ltd, Pune, India) for all isolations. Hundred microlitres were immediately cultured onto mCCDA with antibiotics. This was followed by incubation at 42 ± 1°C for 48 h under the microaerobic conditions (5% O2, 10% CO2, and 85% N2) in an anaerobic jar (Anaerobic System Mark VI, HiMedia, Mumbai India).Presumptive thermotolerant Campylobacter colonies were picked based on their morphological characteristics. Biochemical tests, which consisted of hippurate hydrolysis, catalase test, indoxyl acetate hydrolysis and H2S test, were performed on colonies isolated from the blood agar plates. The HiCampylobacter™ Latex Test Kit (Hi-Media, India), a	rapid	latex	agglutination	test	was	used	for	confirmation	of	the isolates as thermophilic Campylobacters.Templates for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were obtained from single bacterial colony, which was selected for every isolate and suspended in sterile saline. Cells were centrifuged to obtain pellet and washed thrice with sterile water	to	remove	media	components.	Purified	DNA	was	prepared using commercial DNA isolation kits (Chromous Biotech (P) Ltd., India) according to manufacturer’s instructions.The presumptive Campylobacter were authenticated by the presence of a 450-bp amplicon obtained using the primers	designed	to	specifically	amplify	coding	regions	from	the	flagellin	gene	by	previously	reported	method[16] using.Forward primer, Pg50 5’-ATGGGATTTCGTATTAAC-3’ and Reverse primer, Pg3 5’-GAACTTTGAACCGATTTG-3’. Tubes were subjected to 25 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 37°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min, followed by a 5 min extension at 72°C. Primers were synthesised by BioResource Biotech (P) Ltd.The 16S rRNA sequencing was carried out and sequenced data were subjected to Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis.The minimum inhibitory concentration of Campylobacter was determined using the agar dilution method towards ampicillin, azithromycin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin,	doxycycline,	gentamycin,	nalidixic	acid,	norfloxacin,	and	tetracycline.	There	is	a	dearth	of internationally validated criteria for breakpoints of susceptible or resistant isolates for Campylobacter. Consequently, where breakpoints from the Clinical and Table 1: Campylobacter jejuni isolated from farm sourcesWild birds and animalsPoultry chickensRodentsFliesHumanWaterSoilTotal samples*644510831588CampylobacterPositive samples1020061274Prevalence (%)15.6244.4407.28087.550*The total number of samples examined was 233Parkar, et al.: Horizontal transmission of Campylobacters in flockwww.ijmm.org427October - December 2014Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) were not available, established breakpoints were used.[17]ResultsIn this study, 64 samples were collected from different wild birds and animals. Faecal samples were collected from 45 poultry chickens from the farm environments and neighboring retail markets, 10 rodents, and 15 humans. Alongside,	water,	soil,	and	flies	were	also	examined	for	presence of Campylobacter spp. In total, 46 Campylobacter isolates were obtained from poultry farms as well as retail poultry. The highest prevalence was found in water samples (87.5%) followed by human faecal samples (80%), soil (50%) and poultry chickens (44.44%), wild birds (15.62%)	and	flies	(7.2%).	All	rodent	samples	were	negative	for Campylobacter spp.The	isolates	were	positively	identified	using	the	PCR‑based	assays	for	identification	of	Campylobacter spp. The PCR yielded the expected amplicon of product size of 450	bp,	with	the	primers	specific	for	flagellin	gene	as	shown	in Figure 1.Partial 16S rRNA sequences of the 46 different isolates were obtained and subjected to BLAST analysis using the NCBI	Blast	software.	The	isolates	were	identified	as	C. jejuni according to the BLAST results as well as phenotyping.The nucleotide sequences of 30 isolates were deposited in NCBI GenBank (accession numbers JQ972883-912). Figure 1 represents the 450-bp amplicon obtained after PCR of	these	isolates.	These	results	positively	confirm	the	presence	of Campylobacter spp. in the Indian poultry environment.The proportion of isolates resistant to each antimicrobial agent for C. jejuni isolates [Table 2] from poultry farm was	as	follows:	100%	for	ciprofloxacin,	norfloxacin	and	nalidixic	acid,	97.82%	for	erythromycin	and tetracycline, and 43.4% for gentamycin. All the isolates in this set were sensitive to ampicillin, azithromycin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, doxycycline and streptomycin. The majority of the isolates were grouped into similar categories. In Table 3 the multidrug resistance phenotypes of the isolates are elucidated. The isolates could be	divided	into	4	multidrug	resistance	profiles.	Almost	52.2% and 43.5% of the isolates belonged to one of the two multidrug resistance phenotypes.DiscussionPrevious studies in India have shown that 39.3% of the poultry, tested positive for Campylobacter in Calcutta, 64% in Vellore, 57% in Maharashtra and 17.14% in the Table 2: Grouping of Campylobacter jejuni isolatesa based on MICb values of antibioticsAntibioticNumber	of	isolates	with	MIC	(µg/ml)	ofMIC50MIC90Resistant isolates0.06250.1250.250.51248163264128256(No.)(%)Ampicillin23311I4800Azithromycin46I0.06250.062500Chloramphenicol2323I1200CiprofloxacinI4612812846100Clindamycin1333I0.50.500Doxycycline451I0.250.2500Erythromycin1 I3251716324597.8Gentamycin2610I100.5321021.7Nalidixic AcidI4612812846100NorfloxacinI3256126425646100Streptomycin46I4400Tetracycline11I43132324597.8aIsolates	from	environmental/poultry	farm	environments,	bMIC was determined by agar dilution method in MHA at 42°C for 48 h in microaerobic atmosphere, I: Indicate breakpoints for resistanceFigure 1: Gel image depicting 450-bp amplicons obtained after PCR assay	of	genomic	DNA	of	Campylobacter	isolates,	using	the	flagellin	gene primer Lane1, C. coli MTCC 131; Lane 2, JQ972908; Lane3, JQ972909; Lane4, JQ972910; Lane5, JQ972911; Lane6, JQ972912; Lane7,	JQ972901;	Lane8,	Thermo	Scientific	GeneRuler	100‑bp	Plus	DNA Ladder (100-3000 bp)www.ijmm.org428Indian Journal of Medical Microbiologyvol. 32, No. 4Meghalaya-Assam region.[17] Our results from Pune, Maharashtra are in agreement with these reported values. However, only C. jejuni was isolated from the poultry farm environments. We do not conclude on this, because of biased detection in favour of this species. It must be noted that the prevalence of Campylobacters in poultry, depends on	not	only	the	isolation	method	but	also	flock	size	and	type, geography, season, animal age, and number of animals investigated. We have no explanation as to why no other species were isolated. Nevertheless, this occurrence was reported in a similar study from New Zealand as well.[13]The presence of Campylobacter in the agricultural context has widely been documented in scientific	literature; however, there are few similar reports from India.[4] The highest prevalence was found in water samples (87.5%) followed by human faecal samples (80%), soil (50%) and poultry chickens (44.44%), wild	birds	(15.62%)	and	flies	(7.2%).	Though	the	presence	of Campylobacter in 11% of rodents was detected in a similar study, we could not detect any Campylobacters from rodents.[18] Wild animals, wild birds, humans and even	flies	could	be	potential	reservoirs	of	C. jejuni in poultry farms. It is thus postulated that either or all these reservoirs may be responsible for horizontal transmission of Campylobacter in the Indian poultry farm environment. Moreover, a large number of Campylobacter isolates obtained in this study showed the same multidrug resistance phenotype despite being isolated from different environmental sources. However, further molecular studies using flaA‑ RFLP or PFGE will be able to elucidate the route of transmission.An important observation was that 80% of humans associated with poultry were found to be positive for Campylobacter. Campylobacter enteritis are usually treated using	fluoroquinolones	and	macrolides.[1] Recent studies have	reported	the	appearance	of	fluoroquinolones	resistant	Campylobacter	spp.	among	poultry	flocks,[7] necessitating the survey of prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in poultry and their antimicrobial resistances. Earlier reports from India show 30.6% and 35.83% of strains from retail poultry were multidrug resistant.[17,19] However, we noted that alarmingly all the C. jejuni isolates from environmental sources as well as humans were multidrug resistant.We wish to highlight these results due to a scarcity of Campylobacter research in India. Further, the results paint a dismal picture because there are no national surveillance studies and hardly any projects taken up to study the problem of Campylobacter. With a population of 1.2 billion people, the increasing rates of Campylobacter carriage in poultry, the alarmingly low infective dose of Campylobacter (only 500 bacterial cells) and the battery of complications following enteric infections, stringent measures must be taken to improve our understanding of Campylobacter in India.References1.
