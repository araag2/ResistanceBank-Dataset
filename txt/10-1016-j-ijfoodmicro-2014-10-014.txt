Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157:H7 is an important food-borne pathogen that has been
implicated in numerous disease outbreaks worldwide. Little is known about the extent and molecular basis of
antimicrobial resistance in STEC O157:H7 of food origin. Therefore, the current study aimed to characterize the
genetic basis of multidrug resistance in 54 STEC O157:H7 strains isolated from 1600 food samples (800 meat
products and 800 dairy products) collected from different street venders, butchers, retail markets, and slaughter-
houses in Egypt. Thirty-one of 54 (57.4%) isolates showed multidrug resistance phenotypes to at least three clas-
ses of antimicrobials. The highest incidence of antimicrobial resistance was to kanamycin (96.8%), followed by
spectinomycin (93.6%), ampicillin (90.3%), streptomycin (87.1%), and tetracycline (80.6%). PCR and DNA se-
quencing were used to screen and characterize integrons and antibiotic resistance genes, and 29.6% and 5.6%
of isolates were positive for class 1 and class 2 integrons, respectively. β-Lactamase-encoding genes were identi-
ﬁed in 63.0% of isolates as follows: blaTEM-1 and blaTEM-52 in 35.2% and 1.9% isolates respectively; blaCMY-2 in 13.0%
isolates; blaCTX-M in 5.6% isolates; blaSHV-12 in 5.6% isolates; and blaOXA-1 in 1.9% isolate. The plasmid-mediated
quinolone resistance genes were identiﬁed in 13.0% of isolates as follows: qnrB, qnrS, andaac (6′)-Ib-cr in 5.6%,
3.7%, and 3.7% isolates, respectively. Finally, the ﬂorfenicol resistance gene ﬂoR was identiﬁed in 7.4% of isolates.
This study demonstrated that meat and dairy products are potential sources of multidrug resistant STEC O157:
H7. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of the occurrence of class 2 integrons, qnrB, qnrS, andaac (6′)-Ib-cr
in STEC O157:H7.

1. Introduction

Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is a group of E. coli that
is deﬁned by the ability to produce toxins called Shiga toxins (Stx)
(Farrokh et al., 2013). Among the different STEC serogroups, O157:H7
is most frequently associated with food-borne outbreaks in North
America, Japan, and parts of Europe (Farrokh et al., 2013). STEC O157:
H7 causes food-borne illness, with symptoms ranging from mild diar-
rhea to life-threatening hemolytic-uremic syndrome (Karch et al.,
2005). Foods associated with outbreaks of STEC include undercooked
ground beef, fresh produce, unpasteurized juices, salami, cheese and
raw (unpasteurized) milk (FDA, 2012).

Antimicrobial resistance is a global public health problem, and grow-
ing scientiﬁc evidence indicates that it is negatively impacted by both
human and animal antimicrobial usages (Guardabassi et al., 2008).
Therapeutic failures due to antimicrobial resistance increase morbidity
and mortality rates, with serious impact at individual, social and eco-
nomical levels. Furthermore, antimicrobial resistance limits the selec-
tion of therapeutic agents and increases the potential for treatment

failures and adverse clinical complications (da Costa et al., 2013). Retail
foods, especially meat and meat products, may be an important vehicle
for community-wide dissemination of antimicrobial resistant E. coli and
extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (Johnson et al., 2005).

Although antimicrobial therapy is not the primary tool for treating
infections caused by STEC O157:H7, multidrug-resistant (MDR) STEC
O157:H7 is a public health issue as those strains participate to a
reservoir of resistance genes that could be easily exchanged between
Enterobacteriaceae in the host and in the environment. Many bacteria
in the human gut that possess several antimicrobial resistance genes
could be laterally transferred in the gut to potentially pathogenic
bacteria (Rolain, 2013). Several studies have been conducted world-
wide to characterize the molecular basis of antimicrobial resistance in
clinical STEC O157:H7 isolates of human origin (Ahmed et al., 2005;
Cergole-Novella et al., 2011; Morabito et al., 2002; Torpdahl et al.,
2014; Van Meervenne et al., 2013), but little is currently known about
the molecular basis of multidrug resistance in STEC O157:H7 isolates
of food origin (Zhao et al., 2001). Therefore, the purpose of this study
was to characterize MDR STEC O157:H7 strains isolated from retail
meat and dairy products collected in a large-scale survey in Egypt by
molecular screening for a wide range of antimicrobial resistance genes
and integrons.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Bacterial isolates

Fifty-four STEC O157:H7 isolates (21 from beef, 4 from chicken, 20
from milk and 9 from cheese) were used in this study. All isolates
were positive for stx1 and/or stx2 Shiga toxin virulence genes. They
were isolated in Egypt from 800 meat products (480 beef and 320
chickens) and 800 dairy products (480 milk, 240 cheeses and 80
yogurts) as previously described (Ahmed and Shimamoto, 2014).

2.2. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

The antimicrobial sensitivity phenotypes of bacterial isolates
were determined using a Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion assay according
to the standards and interpretive criteria described by Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, 2011). The following antibi-
otics were used: ampicillin (AMP), 10 μg; amoxicillin-clavulanic
acid (AMC), 20/10 μg; cefoxitin (FOX), 30 μg; cefotetan (CTT),
30 μg; cefotaxime (CTX), 30 μg; cefpodoxime (CPD), 10 μg; ceftriax-
one (CRO), 30 μg; aztreonam (ATM), 30 μg; nalidixic acid (NAL),
30 μg; ciproﬂoxacin (CIP), 5 μg; chloramphenicol (CHL), 30 μg;
gentamicin (GEN), 10 μg; kanamycin (KAN), 30 μg; oxacillin (OXA),
30 μg; streptomycin (STR), 10 μg; spectinomycin (SPX), 10 μg; sulfa-
methoxazole/trimethoprim (SXT), 23.75/1.25 μg, and tetracycline
(TET), 30 μg. The disks were purchased from Oxoid (Basingstoke,
UK) and the results were recorded based on CLSI guidelines (CLSI,

2011). The reference strain E. coli ATCC 25922 was included as a
quality control.

2.3. Bacterial DNA preparation

DNA was prepared using boiled lysates, as previously described
(Ahmed et al., 2013). All MDR STEC O157:H7 isolates (resistance to at
least three classes of antimicrobials) were subcultured in Luria-Bertani
broth medium. An overnight bacterial culture (200 μl) was mixed
with 800 μl of distilled water and boiled for 10 min. The resulting
solution was centrifuged, and the supernatant used as a DNA template.
DNA was stored at −20 °C until used.

2.4. PCR screening for integrons and antimicrobial resistance genes

Conserved primers were used to detect and identify class 1 and
class 2 integrons, as previously described (Ahmed et al., 2013).
PCR screening for TEM, SHV, CTX-M, OXA, and CMY β-lactamase-
encoding genes was performed using universal primers for the
TEM, SHV, OXA, CTX-M, and CMY families (Ahmed et al., 2013).
Other universal ﬂanking gene primers were used for identiﬁcation
of the whole β-lactamase-encoding genes (except for TEM as the
universal primers used for TEM family are already located in the
ﬂanking regions of the gene) as described previously (Ahmed et al.,
2007). Furthermore, PCR ampliﬁcation was used to screen for
plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, and
aac(6′)-Ib-cr, as described previously (Ahmed et al., 2013). Finally,
the ﬂorfenicol resistance gene, ﬂoR, was detected using primers

StCM-L and StCM-R, as described previously (Ahmed et al., 2013).
The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.0% agarose
gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light.
PCR fragments were then puriﬁed from the agarose gel using a
QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Japan). Both DNA strands of
the PCR product were sequenced using an ABI automatic DNA se-
quencer (Model 373; Perkin-Elmer). Of note, all above mentioned
experiments were carried out on only MDR STEC O157:H7 isolates
and primers are compiled in Table 1.

2.5. Computer analysis of the sequence data

A similarity search was carried out using the BLAST program,
available at the NCBI BLAST homepage (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/Blast.cgi).

3. Results

3.1. Incidence of MDR STEC O157:H7 in meat and dairy products

Thirty-one out of 54 (57.4%) STEC O157:H7 isolates showed multi-
drug resistance phenotypes (i.e. resistance to at least three classes of
antimicrobials). The incidence of MDR STEC O157:H7 was 56.0% in
meat products and 58.6% in dairy products. The most widespread resis-
tance in MDR STEC O157:H7 was to kanamycin (96.8% of isolates),
followed by spectinomycin (93.6%), ampicillin (90.3%), streptomycin
(87.1%), and tetracycline (80.6%).

3.2. Incidence of class 1 and class 2 integrons in STEC O157:H7 from meat
and dairy products

PCR identiﬁed class 1 integrons in 16 (29.6%) STEC O157:H7 isolates
(Table 2). The incidence of class 1 integrons was 28.0% in meat products
and 31.0% in dairy products (Table 2). DNA sequencing results of the
inserted gene cassettes identiﬁed six types of class 1 integron, with
eight different antimicrobial resistance gene cassettes (Table 3). The
identiﬁed antimicrobial resistance genes were: dihydrofolate reductase
types (dfrA1 and dfrA17), which confer resistance to trimethoprim; ami-
noglycoside adenyltransferase types (aadA1, aadA2, aadA5, aadA7, and
aadA23), which confer resistance to streptomycin and spectinomycin;
and aminoglycoside acetyltransferase (aac(3)-Id), which confers resis-
tance to gentamicin, sisomicin, and fortimicin (Table 3). In contrast,
PCR identiﬁed only three (5.6%) STEC O157:H7 isolates containing
class 2 integrons (Table 2). The incidence of class 2 integrons was 4.0%
in meat products and 6.9% in dairy product (Table 2). DNA sequencing
results for the inserted gene cassettes identiﬁed two types of class 2
integron (Table 3): the classical type, containing the three conserved re-
sistance gene cassettes of class 2 integrons, dfrA1, sat2, and aadA1, which
confer resistance to trimethoprim, streptothricin, and streptomycin/
spectinomycin, respectively; and the short type of class 2 integron,
containing only two gene cassettes, dfrA1 and sat2 (Table 3).

3.3. Incidence of β-lactamase-encoding genes in STEC O157:H7 from meat
and dairy products

PCR identiﬁed β-lactamase-encoding genes in 34 (63.0%) STEC
O157:H7 isolates (Table 2). The incidence of β-lactamase-encoding
genes was 60.0% in meat products and 65.5% in dairy products
(Table 2). DNA sequencing identiﬁed the following β-lactamase-
encoding genes: narrow spectrum β-lactamase-encoding genes,
blaTEM-1 and blaOXA-1 in 19 (35.2%) isolates and one (1.9%) isolate
respectively; the extended-spectrum β-lactamase-encoding genes,
blaCTX-M in three (5.6%) isolates (two blaCTX-M-3 and one blaCTX-M-15),
blaSHV-12 in three (5.6%) isolates, and blaTEM-52 in one (1.9%) isolate;
and AmpC β-lactamase-encoding gene, blaCMY-2, in seven (13.0%)
isolates (Table 2).

3.4. Incidence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes in STEC
O157:H7 from meat and dairy products

Multiplex PCR screening identiﬁed plasmid-mediated quinolone
resistance genes in seven (13.0%) STEC O157:H7 isolates (Table 2).
The incidence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes was
12.0% in meat products and 13.8% in dairy products (Table 2). DNA
sequencing identiﬁed the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance
genes qnrB, qnrS, and aac(6′)-Ib-cr in three (5.6%), two (3.7%), and
two (3.7%) isolates, respectively (Table 3).

3.5. Incidence of the ﬂorfenicol resistance gene, ﬂoR, in STEC O157:H7 from
meat and dairy products

PCR and DNA sequence analysis identiﬁed ﬂoR in four (7.4%) STEC
O157:H7 isolates (two isolates from meat products (8.0%) and two
isolates (6.9%) from dairy products) (Table 2).

4. Discussion

Integrons are gene-capture systems that play a fundamental role in
dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes, especially in Gram-
negative bacteria (Rowe-Magnus and Mazel, 2002). In this study, class
1 and class 2 integrons with different antibiotic resistance gene cas-
settes were detected in STEC O157:H7 isolates from meat products.
Our results showed a higher incidence of integrons than was previously
reported in Japan, where 11.6% of the E. coli isolates recovered from re-
tail chicken meat were positive for class 1 integrons, and 1.4% were pos-
itive for class 2 integrons (Ahmed et al., 2009). In the USA, Zhao et al.
found that 18% of STEC (including O157:H7) isolated from cattle were

positive for class 1 integrons (Zhao et al., 2001). In Norway, class 2
integrons were identiﬁed in 9.4% of E. coli isolated from meat and
meat products (Sunde, 2005). Class 1 and class 2 integrons were also
detected in STEC O157:H7 isolates, from dairy products in this study.
In Egypt, class 1 and class 2 integrons have been reported in E. coli iso-
lated from milk samples collected from bovine mastitis cases with
2.7% and 0.9%, respectively (Ahmed and Shimamoto, 2011). In USA,
class 1 integrons were found in eight of 10 E. coli isolates (including
one STEC O157:H7 from dairy farms and seven non-Stx-producing
E. coli from dairy/bovine mastitis) (Murinda et al., 2005).

Production of β-lactamases is considered the main mechanism of re-
sistance against penicillin-derivative antibiotics (β-lactams) in Gram-
negative bacteria (Bradford, 2001). Extended-spectrum cephalosporins
(ESCs) are an important class of drugs used in human and veterinary
medicine. Resistance to ESCs in STEC O157:H7 is usually mediated by
the production of AmpC β-lactamases, commonly encoded by blaCMY-2
genes (Folster et al., 2014). In this study, various types of narrow- and
extended-spectrum β-lactamase-encoding genes were identiﬁed (includ-
ing blaTEM-1, blaOXA-1, blaCTX-M-3, blaCTX-M-15, blaSHV-12, and blaTEM-52), in
addition to AmpC β-lactamase-encoding gene, blaCMY-2. Our results
are similar to those of a previous report from Canada, in which blaTEM,
blaCMY, and blaSHV were found in 56%, 12%, and 4%, respectively, of
ampicillin-resistant E. coli isolates recovered from a commercial beef
processing plant (Aslam et al., 2009). However, the incidence of β-
lactamase genes in isolates from our study is higher than in a recent re-
port from Iran, in which 14.7% and 2.9% of STEC strains isolated from
the external surfaces of chicken carcasses carried the blaTEM and blaSHV
genes, respectively (Bagheri et al., 2014). In Japan, blaTEM-1 and blaCMY-2
were identiﬁed in 17.3% and 23.2% of E. coli isolates, respectively, from
retail chicken meat (Ahmed et al., 2009). The presence of blaCMY-2 in
meat products has great public health signiﬁcance, as blaCMY-2 identiﬁed

in E. coli from broiler meat in Europe has recently also been identiﬁed
in clinical isolates from Swedish patients (Börjesson et al., 2013b).
Regarding the types of blaCTX-M gene, previously, British and Swiss studies
reported blaCTX-M-15 in E. coli isolates from animal meats (Geser et al.,
2012). In Spain, blaSHV-12 is the most frequent extended-spectrum
β-lactamase (ESBL) carried by E. coli isolates from raw poultry meat
(Egea et al., 2012). More recently, it was found that 44% of Swedish chick-
en meat samples were contaminated with extended-spectrum or trans-
ferable AmpC β-lactamase-producing E. coli strains (Börjesson et al.,
2013a). β-Lactamase-encoding genes were also detected in STEC O157:
H7 isolates from dairy products in this study. These genes included
blaTEM-1, blaTEM-52, blaCMY-2, blaCTX-M-15, blaSHV-12, and blaOXA-1. In
Egypt, blaTEM-1 was identiﬁed in E. coli isolated from milk samples
collected from bovine mastitis cases (Ahmed and Shimamoto, 2011). In
Switzerland, only one E. coli isolate from mastitis milk samples contained
blaCTX-M-14 and blaTEM-1, while all bulk tank milk samples were negative
for β-lactamases (Geser et al., 2012). More recently, E. coli isolates con-
taining blaCTX-M-1 and blaCMY-2 were identiﬁed from dairy and beef cattle
farms in Germany (Schmid et al., 2013). blaTEM-52 gene, encoding an
extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL), was ﬁrst described in clinical
isolate of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from the culture of a stool patient
in 1998 in France (Poyart et al., 1998) and recently it also spread among
E. coli isolated from cattle in France (Haenni et al., 2012).

Fluoroquinolones are broad-spectrum antimicrobials used in
medicine and veterinary practice to treat infectious diseases caused by
enteric bacteria. In this study, the plasmid-mediated quinolone resis-
tance genes qnrB and qnrS were identiﬁed in 12.0% of tested STEC
O157:H7 isolates from meat products. Recently, qnrS and aac(6)-Ib-cr
were identiﬁed in E. coli isolates from retail chicken and ground pork
in China (Xu et al., 2014). Furthermore, qnrB, qnrS, and aac(6)-Ib-cr
were identiﬁed in 13.8% of STEC O157:H7 isolates from dairy products.
In Egypt, qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, and aac(6)-Ib-cr were identiﬁed in 14.3% of
Gram-negative bacteria isolated from bovine mastitis cases (Ahmed
and Shimamoto, 2011). To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst re-
port of the detection and identiﬁcation of plasmid-mediated quinolone
resistance genes in STEC O157:H7.

The resistance to ﬂorfenicol, a closely related drug to chloram-
phenicol, is mediated by ﬂoR resistance gene (Bischoff et al., 2002).
Although ﬂorfenicol is not approved for human use, it is related to
chloramphenicol, and can select for cross-resistance in bacterial
pathogens. In this study, ﬂoR was identiﬁed in 8.0% of STEC O157:
H7 from meat products and from 6.9% of isolates from dairy
products. In the USA, ﬂoR was present in 43% of chloramphenicol-
resistant E. coli isolates from retail meats (Zhao et al., 2012). In
Egypt, ﬂoR was detected in 6.3% of Gram-negative bacteria isolated
from cases of bovine mastitis (Ahmed and Shimamoto, 2011), and
recently from avian pathogenic E. coli isolated from septicemic
broilers (Ahmed et al., 2013). To the best of our knowledge, this is
the ﬁrst report of the detection and identiﬁcation of ﬂoR in STEC
O157:H7 isolated from food.

5. Conclusions

This study characterized the molecular basis of multidrug resistance
in STEC O157:H7 isolated from retail meat and dairy products in Egypt.
This is the ﬁrst report of the occurrence of class 2 integrons, qnrB, qnrS,
and aac(6′)-Ib-cr in STEC O157:H7. These data provide useful informa-
tion to better understand the molecular basis of antimicrobial resistance
in STEC O157:H7 of food origin. The study also highlights meat and
dairy products as potential sources of MDR STEC O157:H7 harboring
different classes of antimicrobial resistance genes and integrons.
Although antimicrobials are not recommended to treat STEC infections,
MDR STEC O157:H7 can laterally transfer these antimicrobial resistance
genes to potentially pathogenic bacteria either in the host or in
the Environment.
