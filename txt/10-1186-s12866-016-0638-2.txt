Abstract
Background: Salmonellae are major worldwide zoonotic pathogens infecting a wide range of vertebrate species
including humans. Consumption of contaminated dairy products and contact with dairy cattle represent a common
source of non-typhoidal Salmonella infection in humans. Despite a large number of small-scale dairy farms in Addis
Ababa and its surrounding districts, little is known about the status of Salmonella in these farms.
Results: Salmonella was recovered from the feces of at least one animal in 7.6 % (10/132) of the dairy farms. Out of
1203 fecal samples examined, 30 were positive for Salmonella resulting in a weighted animal level prevalence of
2.3 %. Detection of diarrhea in an animal and in a farm was significantly associated with animal level (p = 0.012) and
herd level (p < 0.001) prevalence of Salmonella. Animal level prevalence of Salmonella was significantly associated
with age (p = 0.023) and study location; it was highest among those under 6 months of age and in farms from
Adaa district and Addis Ababa (p < 0.001). Nine different serotypes were identified using standard serological
agglutination tests. The most frequently recovered serotypes were Salmonella Typhimurium (23.3 %), S. Saintpaul
(20 %), S. Kentucky (16.7 %) and S. Virchow (16.7 %). All isolates were resistant or intermediately resistant to at least one
of the 18 drugs tested. Twenty-six (86.7 %), 19 (63.3 %), 18 (60 %), 16 (53.3 %) of the isolates were resistant to
streptomycin, nitrofurantoin, sulfisoxazole and tetracycline , respectively. Resistance to 2 drugs was detected in
27 (90 %) of the isolates. Resistance to 3 or more drugs was detected in 21 (70 %) of the isolates, while resistance to 7
or more drugs was detected in 11 (36.7 %) of the isolates. The rate of occurrence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) in
Salmonella strains isolated from dairy farms in Addis Ababa was significantly higher than those isolated from farms
outside of Addis Ababa (p = 0.009). MDR was more common in S. Kentucky, S. Virchow and S. Saintpaul.
Conclusion: Isolation of Salmonella serotypes commonly known for causing human salmonellosis that are associated
with an MDR phenotype in dairy farms in close proximity with human population is a major public health concern.
These findings imply the need for a strict pathogen reduction strategy.

Background
Salmonella is a diverse bacterial species comprising over
2600 serotypes [1]. Salmonella commonly colonizes a
range of animal hosts such as mammals, amphibians,
reptiles, birds and insects [2]. There are 2 species of Sal-
monella: Salmonella enterica and Salmonella bongori.

Salmonella enterica is further classified into 6 subspecies
(Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica, S. enterica
Subspecies salmae, S. enterica Subspecies arizonae, S.
enterica Subspecies diarizonae, S. enterica Subspecies
hautenae and S. enterica Subspecies indica). Most of the
Salmonella serotypes are part of S. enterica subspecies
enterica, and over 99 % of human and animal infections
are caused by serotypes under this subspecies [3].

Diseases caused by Salmonella represent an important
public health problem among the common bacterial

foodborne pathogens worldwide. It is estimated that glo-
bally 93.8 million cases and 155,000 deaths are associ-
ated with gastroenteritis due to Salmonella species
annually. Of these cases, 85.6 % were estimated to be
foodborne [4]. Human salmonellosis has been associated
with contaminated food products, mainly those of animal
origin such as poultry, beef, pork and dairy products, as
well as direct contact with infected animals [5–7].

Various serotypes of Salmonella have been isolated
from the feces of apparently healthy dairy cattle. Sal-
monella in dairy animals may exist as a normal micro-
biota of the gastrointestinal population, or as a transient
member of the gastrointestinal microbial population [8].
All sick, recovered and asymptomatic cattle can shed
Salmonella through feces and the organism can survive
for a long time in favorable environments outside the
[9]. Fecal shedding of Salmonella can increase
host
intra-herd transmission, accidental
spread to other
herds, environmental contamination and risk of human
infection [10]. Consumption of raw milk, inadequately
pasteurized milk,
improperly cooked beef from culled
dairy cattle, contaminated water and direct animal con-
tact are the major routes of acquiring dairy associated
salmonellosis in humans [6].

In Ethiopia, there are large numbers of small-scale
peri-urban dairy farms mainly situated close to areas of
public residence. Most of these farms are located very
close to Addis Ababa, capital city of the country, or res-
ide within the city in a very close proximity with human
populations. The consumption of raw milk and its deriv-
atives is common in Ethiopia, posing high risk of infec-
tion with dairy-associated foodborne pathogens. Such
pathogens include Salmonella spp., Klebsiella spp., En-
terobacter spp., and Escherichia coli, which have been
identified in milk products in Ethiopia [11]. Gram posi-
tive pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus
cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus spp.
have also been frequently isolated from milk [12, 13].

Occurrence of non-typhoidal Salmonella serotypes
commonly infecting humans in dairy cattle, particularly,
those stains resistant to antimicrobial agents commonly
used in human medicine, are a serious threat to human
(MDR) Salmonella
health. Some multi-drug resistant
outbreaks in humans have been linked to exposure to
dairy farms or contaminated dairy products [6, 14]. In-
formation on the prevalence, serotype distribution and
antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella in dairy farms
is vital to implementation of appropriate strategies to
prevent the introduction and spread of the pathogen in
the farm as well as to reduce the risk of human salmon-
ellosis. Knowledge on the serotypes circulating in dairy
farms would inform scientists/clinicians on the role of
dairy cattle as a source of human Salmonella infec-
tions. A previous study conducted in Addis Ababa has

shown farm level prevalence of 47.8 % and animal level
prevalence of 7.7 % [15]. However, this study involved
small sample size and the isolates were not serotyped.
Given the relative lack of information concerning the
prevalence and serotype distribution of Salmonella spp.
in dairy farms in Ethiopia, the present study was de-
signed to investigate animal level and herd level fecal
prevalence of Salmonella, serotype distribution and
antimicrobial resistance profiles of Salmonella in dairy
farms in and around Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It also
attempted to investigate the association of farm size, oc-
currence of diarrhea in the farm and age of animals with
prevalence of Salmonella in these dairy farms.

Methods
Study design, study area and sampling of study animals
A cross-sectional study was conducted in Addis Ababa
and in five districts of the Oromia region located at the
outskirt of Addis Ababa, namely: Sebeta, Barake, Wel-
mera, Sululta and Adaa (Fig. 1). In these areas, the inter-
action between animal and human population is very
high due to high density of the human populations and
the large number of peri-urban dairy farming facilities.
These areas are the major sources of dairy milk supply
to Addis Ababa. Sampling of study herds and animals
was conducted from June to December 2013. Study ani-
mals were selected from 132 dairy herds (Addis Ababa; n
= 38; Adaa, n = 12; Sebeta, n = 21; Sululta, n = 24; Wel-
mera; n = 18). Inclusion of herd in the sampling was based
on representation of the area under study, willingness of
the owners, geographical accessibility, and the herd having
a minimum of 5 cattle. The largest herd size contained
398 head of cattle. Farms were categorized into small (5–
20 animals in a herd), medium (21–50 animals in a herd)
and large (more than 50 animals). Mean herd size of small,
medium and large farms was 12.6, 31.7 and 100.4, respect-
ively. In total 1203 fecal samples were collected from
healthy as well as diarrheic cattle during the study period.
The study design was cross-sectional implying a one point
fecal sample collection from a given herd and hence there
was no repeated fecal sample collection.

Sample collection, Salmonella isolation and identification
Fecal samples were collected directly from the rectum
using disposable gloves into sterile zippered plastic
bags and transported to the Microbiology Laboratory,
Aklilu Lemma Institute of Pathobiology, in an ice box
within 3–4 h of collection. Isolation and identification
of Salmonella was conducted using conventional methods
[16, 17]. Briefly, 10 g of feces was pre-enriched in 90 ml
of buffered peptone water (BPW) (Becton Dickinson,
Sparks, MD) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. A
100 μl pre-enriched suspension was added into 9.9 ml
of Rappaport-Vassiliadis
enrichment Broth (RVB)

Fig. 1 Locations of Addis Ababa and surrounding districts where fecal samples from dairy cattle were collected (source: Original Ethiopian shape
file was obtained from Ethiopian Mapping Agency)

(Oxoid, USA) and incubated at 42 °C for 24 h. At the
same time, 1 ml of suspension was also transferred to
10 ml of Tetrathionate broth (TTB) (Oxoid, USA) and
incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. It was then streaked from
both RVB and TTB to Xylose Lysine Tergitol 4 (XLT-4)
(Oxoid, USA) selective media and the plates were incu-
bated at 37 °C for 24 to 48 h. Presumptive Salmonella
colonies were further investigated biochemically using
Triple Sugar Iron agar, Urea, Citrate and Lysine Iron
Agar slants. Those colonies with typical Salmonella
biochemical properties were then further confirmed by
genus specific PCR [18]. A reference strain of S. Typhi-
murium (ATCC 14028) was used as a positive control
during biochemical analysis and PCR. One confirmed
Salmonella isolate from each positive sample was
stored at −80 °C in 20 % glycerol until further testing.

Data collection
Information such as herd size, housing condition, types
of antimicrobials commonly used in the farm, age, sex of
animals and presence of diarrhea in a farm was recorded
using a purposively designed questionnaire. A farm was
categorized as a diarrheic farm if one or more animals in
the herd were diarrheic at the time of sample collection.
Collection of data was performed at the time of fecal
sample collection from each farm.

Salmonella serotyping and phage typing
Salmonella isolates were serotyped and phage typed at
the World Organization for Animal Health (OIÉ) Refer-
ence Laboratory for Salmonellosis of the Public Health
Agency of Canada’s National Microbiology at Guelph.
Serovars were determined by
serum agglutination

according to the White-Kauffmann-Le Minor scheme
[19, 20], with identification of somatic (O) antigens by
slide agglutination tests [21] and flagellar (H) antigens
by a microplate agglutination technique [22]. S. Typhi-
murium isolates were phage typed by the methods de-
veloped initially by Callow [23] and extended by
Anderson et al. [24] and Rabsch [25] with 30 refer-
ence phages obtained directly from the WHO Refer-
typing of Salmonella
ence Laboratory
species at Public Health England or from the same
source via Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory at
Winnipeg. These typing phages were number 1–35 with
discontinued use of phages 9, 30, 31, 33 and 34. Internal
reference strains of phage type 1 (fully susceptible)
and phage type 124 (susceptible to only one phage)
were included as controls. Isolates that reacted with
the phages but did not conform to any recognized
phage type were designated atypical (AT), while those
that did not react with any of the typing phages were
designated untypeable (UT).

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
Susceptibility of the isolates to 18 antimicrobials was de-
termined using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method ac-
cording to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute [26]. The following antimicrobials
(Sensi-Discs, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Loveton,
USA) and disc potencies (μg) were used: amikacin (30),
amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (20/10), ampicillin (10), cefox-
itin (30), ceftriaxone (30), cephalothin (30), chlorampheni-
col (30), ciprofloxacin (5), gentamicin (10), kanamycin
(30), nalidixic acid (30), neomycin (30), nitrofurantoin
(100), streptomycin (10), sulfisoxazole (1000), sulfameth-
oxazole + trimethoprim (23.75/1.25), trimethoprim (5) and
tetracycline (30). The interpretation of the categories of
susceptible, intermediate or resistant was based on the
CLSI guidelines [26]. For the purpose of analysis, all read-
ings classified as intermediate were considered as resistant
unless indicated.

E. coli ATCC 25922 was used as a quality control

organism.

Statistical analysis
The data analysis method that fits to survey data as it is
implemented in STATA version 12 was used to estimate
prevalence of Salmonella and to investigate its associ-
ation with pre-specified background characteristics. In
animal level analysis, the probability of selecting a given
animal from a given herd was considered as a weighting
variable. Animal level prevalence of Salmonella was cal-
culated as the weighted percentage of Salmonella culture-
positive fecal samples among the total number of animals
examined. Herd level prevalence of Salmonella was calcu-
lated as the percentage of herds with one or more

Salmonella culture-positive fecal samples among the total
number of herds sampled. Association of weighted animal
level prevalence and selected background characteristics
was assessed using pearson chi-square within survey com-
mand of STATA software. Association of herd level Sal-
monella positivity and pre-specified characteristics was
assessed using pearson chi-square. The difference between
mean numbers of antimicrobials to which isolates were
resistant was compared using a student t-test. Results
were reported as being statistically significant whenever
the p-value was less than 0.05.

Ethics statement
Ethical clearance for the study was obtained from the
National Research Ethics Review Committee, Ethiopia.
Informed oral consent was obtained from the farm
owners at the time of sample collection.

Results
Prevalence and risk factors
Weighted animal level Salmonella prevalence was 2.3 %
and at least one Salmonella positive animal was detected
in 7.6 % (10/132) of the herds examined. There was no
significant difference in prevalence of Salmonella be-
tween male and female animals. Significant difference in
the prevalence of Salmonella was observed across differ-
ent age groups (p = 0.023) and the largest was observed
in cattle less than 6 months old. Similarly, animal level
prevalence of Salmonella among study sites was signifi-
cantly different (p < 0.001): highest prevalence was 5 %
in Adaa followed by 4.2 % in Addis Ababa and 2.0 % in
Sebeta (Table 1). However, herd level prevalence of Sal-
monella was not significantly different among study sites
(Table 2). Diarrhea was detected in 34 of 1203 animals.
Three of the diarrheic animals were positive for Salmon-
ella whereas 27 out of 1169 non-diarrheic animals were
positive for Salmonella. These 3 Salmonella positive
diarrheic animals were a 2 week old calf infected with
S.Typhimurium var. Copenhagen on a farm in Adaa
district, a 3 month old calf infected with S. kentucky in
Addis Ababa and a 6 year old cow infected with S.
Dublin in the Sebeta district. Detection of diarrhea in
an animal was significantly associated with animal
level Salmonella carriage (p = 0.012) (Table 1). Detec-
tion of diarrhea in one or more animals in a farm was
also significantly associated with herd level prevalence
of Salmonella (p < 0.001) (Table 2). Out of 255 fecal
samples collected from 24 diarrheic herds, 22 were
positive for Salmonella whereas, only 8 of the 948
fecal samples collected from 108 non-diarrheic herds
were positive for Salmonella. Six of 24 (25 %) of diar-
rheic herds were positive for Salmonella while only 4
of 108 (3.7 %) of non-diarrheic herds were positive
for Salmonella (p < 0.001).

cattle were totally outdoors.

Salmonella serotype distribution
Nine different serotypes were identified (Table 3). S.
Typhimurium, grouped with its variant S. Typhimurium

three study sites (Adaa, Sululta and Barake districts). S.
Saintpaul (6, 20 %) was isolated only from a single farm
in the Adaa district, S. Kentucky (5, 16.7 %), and S. Vir-
chow (5, 16.7 %) were isolated from five animals each in
two different farms in Addis Ababa, while S. Dublin (3,
10 %) and one isolate (1, 3.3 %) of S. Livingstone var.14
+, S. I: 6, 7, 14:-: I,w, S. Mikawasima and S. Aberdeen
were isolated from one animal on five different farms.
Two different serotypes were isolated from two farms in
the present study (Table 4).

Antimicrobial resistance
The common antimicrobials used in the farms were oxy-
tetracycline, penicillin + streptomycin, and sulfonamide
in 94.6, 81.8 and 13.6 % of the farms, respectively. Re-
sistance patterns of the isolates are shown in Table 4. All
isolates were resistant to at least one of the 18 antimi-
crobials tested. Twenty-six (86.7 %), 19 (63.3 %), 18
(60 %), 16 (53.3 %) of the isolates were resistant to
streptomycin, nitrofurantoin, sulfisoxazole and tetracyc-
line, respectively. Resistance to two or more antimicro-
bials was recorded in 90 % of
the isolates, while
resistance to 3 or more antimicrobials was detected in
21 (70 %) of the isolates. MDR to 7 or more antimicro-
bials were detected in 11 (36.7 %) of the isolates. The
five S. Kentucky isolates were resistant to 10–13 antimi-
crobials (Table 4). One isolate (S. Kentucky) from a farm
in Addis Ababa was resistant to 13 out of 18 antimicro-
bials tested. All
isolates were susceptible to amikacin,
chloramphenicol, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone and sulfameth-
oxazole + trimethoprim.

There was a statistically significant difference in the
rate of occurrence of MDR between isolates obtained
from dairy farms in Addis Ababa and outside of the city
limits of Addis Ababa. The mean ± standard error of
mean (SEM) number of antimicrobials to which isolates
obtained from Addis Ababa were resistant was 7.23 ±
1.32, while isolates obtained outside of Addis Ababa
were resistant to 4 ± 0.62 antimicrobials (p = 0.01). Re-
sistance to first
line antimicrobial agents in human
medicine for treatment of Salmonella like beta-lactam
and quinolones was also more common in isolates ob-
tained from Addis Ababa. The extent of MDR varied
with the serotype, as the overall MDR was more com-
mon in S. Kentucky, S. Virchow and S. Saintpaul com-
pared to strains from other serotypes. Interestingly, all of
the 5 Kentucky strains were resistant to nalidixic acid
and ciprofloxacin (Table 4).

Discussion
Food animals are the primary sources for transmitting
non-typhoidal Salmonella to humans [27]. Outbreaks of
salmonellosis in humans has been linked to improperly
pasteurized dairy products, undercooked beef, water

runoff from farms, and direct animal or fecal contact
[28]. In the current study, farm level prevalence of Sal-
monella was 7.6 % and individual animal level preva-
lence was 2.3 %, which is much lower than the previous
studies in the USA, where 31 % of dairy farms had at
least one cow shedding Salmonella in feces and 7.3 % of
individual animals were shedding [29]. It is also much
lower than a previous study conducted in Addis Ababa
[15] that reported farm level fecal prevalence of 47.8 %
and individual animal level prevalence of 7.7 %. A study
on slaughtered cattle in Addis Ababa recovered Salmon-
ella from 7.1 % of apparently healthy animals [30]. Re-
cent study in Jordan showed 23 % and 4 % of herd level
and individual animal level prevalence of Salmonella in
dairy farms, respectively, which is also higher than our
finding [31]. This difference could be due to differences
in the Salmonella isolation protocol employed in each
study, seasonal variation in Salmonella shedding of ani-
mals as well as other factors such as herd size and age
composition [28, 29]. Most of the farms in the current
study had small herd size. Moreover, animals of all age
groups in the farm were sampled in the current study
unlike the other two studies [15, 29] which involved
only lactating cows.

This study also showed that Salmonella shedding was
common in farms that keep animals completely indoors
while none was detected in those that occasionally graze
outside or are totally outdoors. Similarly, higher preva-
lence of Salmonella was reported in swine kept indoors
than those kept outdoors [32]. This probably is due to
free cycling of Salmonella between animals in a limited
host environment once the pathogen gets access to the
farm in animals kept indoors. The fact that the use of
processed feed is more common in animals kept indoors
than those kept outdoors might also suggest the possibil-
ity of indoor kept animals being infected with Salmon-
ella from contaminated animal feed. A previous study
has also shown livestock waste generated by animals
consuming a diet principally composed of grass were
less likely to harbor Salmonella spp. [33].

In this study, the larger the herd size, the higher the
probability of having Salmonella positive animals in the
farm, which is in agreement with previous reports [34–
37]. This could be due to overcrowding of animals in
the larger herds, especially those housed indoors, in-
creasing animal
to animal contact which enhances
transmission of pathogens within the herd. Moreover,
the larger the number of animals in the herd, the higher
the probability of having a few weak and stressed ani-
mals, which increases the likelihood of continuous
shedding of Salmonella from these cattle. Asymptom-
atic carrier cattle have been reported to shed Salmon-
ella for up to 18 months [38]. Additionally,

absence of mechanized feeding and milking systems in

Ethiopia, several animal attendants are involved in daily
activities of the large farms with the possibility of serv-
ing as a source of dissemination among individual ani-
mals in a farm. Contrary to the above findings, another
study has reported that there is no association of herd
size and Salmonella shedding [29].

The strong association of individual animal and herd
level prevalence of Salmonella with detection of diarrhea
in one or more animals suggests that Salmonella is one
of the causes of diarrhea in dairy cattle in the study popu-
lation. Detection of more Salmonella from diarrheic as
well as non-diarrheic cattle in farms with one or more
diarrheic animal in the herd might be due to the presence

of carrier animals shedding Salmonella to other animals
without showing clinical manifestations post infection or
after recovery from clinical salmonellosis [39].

The higher Salmonella recovery rate in young animals
in the current study is presumably due to the lack of an
adequate adaptive immune response in the young calves
compared to adult animals. Also, co-infection with mul-
tiple enteric pathogens is common in calves and may
compromise their immune system. In addition, relative
lack of protective microflora in calves may also predis-
pose them to pathogenic organisms [37]. A previous
study has similarly reported an inverse relationship of
calf age and the prevalence of Salmonella [40].

The dominant serotypes isolated from dairy cattle in
the current study, S. Typhimurium, S. Saintpaul, S. Vir-
chow and S. Kentucky, are among the common causes
[41–43].
of non-typhoidal
There is no previous report in Ethiopia showing serotype
distribution of Salmonella in dairy cattle. The top three
serotypes in slaughtered cattle in Addis Ababa were S.
Mishmarhaemek, S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis [30].
In another study conducted in north Ethiopia in slaugh-
tered cattle, S. Typhimurium and S. Newport were the
two dominant serotypes recovered [44].

The observed high resistance to streptomycin and
tetracycline is not surprising since these antimicrobials
are commonly used in most of the farms for manage-
ment of bacterial infections. Similar high resistance rates
were reported to streptomycin (77 %) and tetracycline
(65.5 %) in Salmonella isolates obtained from different
food animals from Ethiopia [45]. Another study also re-
ported 75 and 46.9 % resistance to streptomycin and
tetracycline in Salmonella isolated from different food
items and personnel in Addis Ababa [46]. Though nitro-
furantoin and sulfonamide were less commonly used in
the farms during the study period, large proportion of
isolates were resistant to these agents. This is probably
due to the fact that these antimicrobials had been used
in the animal health sector for a long time in the coun-
try and Salmonella had already developed resistance. A
previous study conducted in Addis Ababa [15] showed
83 % of Salmonella isolates from dairy farms to be re-
sistant to 2 or more antimicrobials out of 10 antimicro-
bials tested. Unlike the previous study [15] that reported
100 % resistance to ampicillin, in the current study, only
33.3 % of the isolates exhibited resistance to ampicillin.
However, most of the isolates obtained from farms in
Addis Ababa were resistant to ampicillin.

Resistance to ciprofloxacin was not reported in the
previous study [15], but in the current study, 30 % of the
isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Despite detection
of resistance to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid in the
current study, from our interview with farm owners dur-
ing sampling, none of the farms was using ciprofloxacin
or other quinolone antimicrobials to treat their dairy
cattle, and use of quinolones is not a regular practice in
veterinary medicine in Ethiopia. However, a similar high
percentage of resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed in
S. Kentucky isolates carrying Salmonella Genomic Island
K (SGI1-K) collected during 2000–2008 from meat of
swine, cattle and poultry [45]. Also, recently isolated S.
Kentucky strains from diarrheic patients in Addis Ababa
were resistant to several antimicrobials including cipro-
floxacin [47]. MDR S. Kentucky belonging to a single
clone resistant to quinolones and carrying SGI1-K has
been reported from European travelers returning from
different African and Asian countries
[48]. This

occurrence of MDR S. Kentucky in both humans and
animals in the region might be due to this specific clone
widely circulating in Africa.

The high MDR in Salmonella from dairy cattle is
alarming. The incidence of MDR in Salmonella has in-
creased in the last few decades globally [49]. Infection of
humans with MDR strains of Salmonella has been re-
ported to be associated with increased burden of mor-
bidity, extended hospitalization, increased risk of invasive
illness and increased mortality, compared to those in-
fected with susceptible strains [50–52]. In fact, the in-
crease in MDR observed in Salmonella isolates from dairy
farms in Addis Ababa compared to those out of Addis
Ababa could be due to greater availability of antimicrobial
agents and extensive use of antimicrobials in both animals
and humans, fostered by a highly populated city where an-
imals and humans live in close proximity.

Conclusion
The occurrence of MDR Salmonella serotypes that com-
monly cause human salmonellosis in dairy herds residing
in close proximity with human populations warrants the
need for strict biosecurity and intervention strategies to
control these Salmonella isolates in dairy farms and to
protect human and animal health. Paramount is the re-
sistance to ciprofloxacin, which is of great concern as
this antimicrobial is among the last options for treat-
ment of complicated non-typhoidal salmonellosis in
humans.
