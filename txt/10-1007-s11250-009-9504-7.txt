Abstract In this study, 32 Salmonella strains isolated
from 400 chicken carcasses were serotyped, and
antibiotic resistance profiles were detected against
12 selected antimicrobial agents using disc diffusion
method. Thirty-two isolates were identified as fol-
lows; 22 (68.7%) Salmonella Enteritidis, five (15.6%)
Salmonella Virchow, three (9.3%) Salmonella Typhi-
murium and two (6.2%) Salmonella Hadar. In all
Salmonella isolates, antibiotic resistance were
detected. Out of 32 Salmonella strains, 22 (68.75%)
displayed multi-drug resistance. Thirty-two (100.0%)
of the isolates were found to be resistant to penicillin
G, 20 (62.5%) to nalidixic acid, four (12.5%) to
cephalothin,
two (6.2%) to streptomycin and two
(6.2%) to tetracycline. Fifteen (68.1%) Salmonella
Enteritidis, one (33.3%) Salmonella Typhimurium,
two (100.0%) Salmonella Hadar and two (40.0%)
Salmonella Virchow were shown to be resistant to
nalidixic acid. Cephalothin resistance was detected in
9.0%, 33.3%, and 20.0% for Salmonella Enteritidis,
Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Virchow,
respectively. The results indicate that Salmonella
recovered from chicken carcasses were resistant to

multiple antimicrobials and that resistance among
these isolates varies by serotype. Also, this emerged
as a significant public health problem.

Introduction

Salmonellosis is a worldwide problem of both devel-
oped and developing countries, causing health prob-
lems, business lost and economic losses for medical
treatment (Gareis 1995). Contaminated chicken meat
may present the greatest potential hazard of human
gastroenteritis caused by salmonellae. The emergence
of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella, which has
lead to failures in the treatment of human salmonello-
sis, is also of great concern worldwide (Poppe et al.
1995; Van Duijkeren and Houwers 2000).

Various antimicrobials in intensively managed food
animals including chickens are often administered
through feed or drinking water either for therapy,
prophylaxis, or growth promotion Van Duijkeren and
Houwers 2000). The increasing single and multiple
antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella strains isolated from
human cases of salmonellosis has been associated with
wide spread use of antimicrobial agents in food animal
production. A considerable number of antimicrobials

894

commonly used in the treatment of salmonellosis and
other bacterial infections of humans are also used in
veterinary practises. This may entail a public health
risk by the transfer of resistant Salmonella and other
zoonotic bacterial pathogens or the resistant genes
from food animals to humans through consumption of
contaminated food and food products (Gay et al. 1994;
Wegner et al. 1999).

The prevalence of Salmonella serotypes and their
antimicrobial resistance have been studied in many
countries (Beli et al. 2001; Bada-Alambedji et al. 2006;
Berrang et al. 2006; Capita et al. 2007; Zewdu and
Cornelius 2009) including Turkey (Sarimehmetoglu et
al. 1996; Aksakal 2003; Goncagul et al. 2004; Erdem
et al. 2005; Kilinc and Aydin 2006).

Very little statistical data on salmonella infections
and salmonella serotypes collected from individual
studies are available in Turkey. Also, Turkey lacks a
national Salmonella reference centre; epidemiological
data on strains isolated in Turkey can only be
collected from the collective findings of individual
studies. Therefore,
the aim of this study was to
highlight
the serotype distribution and antibiotic
resistance profiles of 32 Salmonella strains previously
isolated from 400 chicken carcasses between 2003
and 2005 in Ankara, Turkey.

Materials and methods

Bacterial strains

Thirty two Salmonella strains previously isolated
from 400 chicken carcasses sold in supermarkets in
Ankara, Turkey between 2003 and 2005 were used as
the material.

Serotyping

Serotype identification of the Salmonella isolates were
performed according to the scheme of Kauffmann–
White, with lam agglutination and serum neutralisation
tests (Popoff 2001). For this purpose, commercial
Salmonella O and H, phase 1 and phase 2 antisera
provided by Difco (Becton Dickinson Co., Franklin
Lakes, NJ, USA) were used separately. Salmonella
strains were formerly serogrouped by the slide agglu-
tination test using O antiserum and were identified by
the tube agglutination test using the antiserum H.

Antimicrobial resistance

All Salmonella isolates were evaluated for resistance
to 12 antimicrobials using the disc diffusion method
as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI; Anon 2006) on Mueller–
Hinton agar
(OXOID CM0337, Hampshire, UK)
using ampicillin (10 µg, OXOID CT0003B), amoxi-
cillin (10 µg, OXOID CT0161B), cephalothin (30 µg,
OXOID CT0010B), chloramphenicol (30 µg, OXOID
CT0013B), ciprofloxacin (5 µg, Oxoid CT0425B),
gentamicin (10 µg, OXOID CT0024B), kanamycin
(30 µg, OXOID CT0026B), nalidixic acid (30 µg,
OXOID CT0031B), penicillin G (10U, OXOID
CT0043B), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (1.25/
23.75 µg, OXOID CT0052B), streptomycin (10 µg,
OXOID CT0047B) and tetracycline (30 µg, OXOID
CT0054B) discs.

The Salmonella strains that have been stored at
−20°C were transferred to Brain Heart Infusion Broth
(OXOID CM0225) and incubated at 35°C for 24 h.
After the incubation period, a loop amount of growth
transferred into 4–5 ml containing Tryptone Soya
Broth (OXOID CM0129). The broth culture was
incubated at 35°C until it achieves the turbidity of the
0.5 McFarland (108 cfu/ml; 2 to 6 h). Turbidity
control was done by comparison to standard McFar-
land tubes. The suspension was inoculated uniformly
on Mueller–Hinton agar (uniform depth of 4 mm)
with a sterile cotton swap. After the agar surface dried
(3–5 min), antibiotic discs were placed on the plates
not closer than 24 mm from centre to centre. The
plates were incubated at 35°C for 16–18 h. At the end
of the incubation, all plates were examined, and zones
around the antibiotic discs were measured by a ruler.
Interpretation of the inhibition zones was performed
according to the recommendations of the CLSI (Anon
2006), and strains were evaluated as susceptible,
intermediate or resistant.

Results

Overall, four different Salmonella serotypes were
identified. Salmonella Enteritidis was the most com-
monly isolated serotype (22 isolates, 68.7%) in this
study. The other ten Salmonella isolates were sero-
typed as follows: Salmonella Virchow (five isolates,
15.6%), Salmonella Typhimurium (three isolates,

Trop Anim Health Prod (2010) 42:893–897

9.3%) and Salmonella Hadar (two isolates, 6.2%;
Table 1). None of the Salmonella isolates showed
resistance against the following antimicrobials: ampi-
cillin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin,
kanamycin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim.

According to the disc diffusion test, 32 (100.0%)
Salmonella isolates were found to be resistant to one
or more antimicrobials. The most common resistance
was to penicillin G (100.0%). The prevalences of
resistance were 62.5%, 12.5%, 6.2% and 6.2% for
nalidixic acid, cephalothin, streptomycin and tetracy-
cline, respectively.

Out of the 32 Salmonella isolates, 22 (68.7%) were
multi-resistant. Fifteen (68.1%) Salmonella Enter-
itidis, one (33.3%) Salmonella Typhimurium,
two
(100.0%) Salmonella Hadar and two (40.0%) Salmo-
nella Virchow were resistant to nalidixic acid. It was
detected that two (9.0%) Salmonella Enteritidis, one
(33.3%) Salmonella Typhimurium and one (20.0%)
Salmonella Virchow were found to be resistant to
cephalothin, while two (100.0%) Salmonella Hadar
were resistant
to streptomycin and tetracycline
(Table 1). Among 22 (68.7%) resistant Salmonella
isolates, 18 (56.25%) had a multiple resistance pattern
to two antimicrobials (16 of them to nalidixic acid
two of them to cephalothin and
and penicillin G,
penicillin G), while two (6.25%)
isolates were
resistant to four antimicrobials (nalidixic acid, peni-
cillin G, streptomycin and tetracycline). Although
most of the isolates had multi-drug resistance to two
antimicrobials (15 Salmonella Enteritidis, two Salmo-
nella Typhimurium, and one Salmonella Virchow),
just four Salmonella isolates had multi-drug resistance
to three or
four antimicrobials (one Salmonella
Enteritidis and one Salmonella Virchow to cephalo-
thin, nalidixic acid and penicillin G; two Salmonella

Hadar to nalidixic acid, penicillin G, streptomycin
and tetracycline; Tables 1 and 2).

Discussion

In this study, Salmonella isolates were identified as
Salmonella Enteritidis (68.7%), Salmonella Virchow
(15.6%), Salmonella Typhimurium (9.3%) and Sal-
monella Hadar (6.2%). Salmonella Enteritidis was
found to be the most prevalent serotype. Salmonella
Enteritidis, Salmonella Typhimurium, Salmonella
Paratyphi B and Salmonella Typhi are the most
common serotypes isolated from humans in Turkey
(Erdem 2001). Erdem et al. (2005) have investigated
53 Salmonella enterica group C isolates obtained
from various human samples in ten provinces of
Turkey during a 2-year period. They have identified
the isolates as Salmonella Virchow and Salmonella
Hadar. Also, Willocks et al. (1996) have reported that
human salmonellosis caused by Salmonella Virchow
is related to consumption of poultry products. Our
results are in agreement with these data. The high
prevalence of Salmonella Enteritidis observed in
present study is comparable to the situation described
by other investigations (Beli et al. 2001; Kilinc and
Aydin 2006; Capita et al. 2007). It
reflects the
presence of this serotype in the intestinal tract of live
chickens (Aksakal 2003), contaminating carcasses
during slaughter and processing (Sarimehmetoglu et
al. 1996).

In the present study, isolates found to be resistant
100% to penicillin G, 62.5% to nalidixic acid, 12.5%
to cephalothin, 6.2% to streptomycin and 6.2% to
tetracycline. Also, multiresistant isolates were 68.7%
in our study. Similarly, Kilinc and Aydin (2006) have

reported that 100% of tested Salmonella isolates were
resistant to penicillin and multi-resistance rate was
high. Penicillins are commonly used antimicrobials
for
the treatment, controlling and prevention of
animal diseases in veterinary medicine and have been
widely used for decades in animal husbandry
(Kowalski and Konieczna 2007).

In the present study, 100% of the Salmonella
isolates were found resistant to one or more anti-
microbials. Berrang et al. (2006) have found that
Salmonella isolates from chicken carcasses were
resistant to nalidixic acid, streptomycin and tetracy-
cline. The results of present study are in agreement
with those of Berrang et al. (2006). Capita et al.
(2007) isolated 60 Salmonella strains from chicken
carcasses and determined 24 of the strains as multi-
resistant (Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Typhi-
murium, and Salmonella Virchow). They have stated
that tetracycline (36.67%), enrofloxacin (23.33%) and
ciprofloxacin (21.67%) resistances were the most
frequently encountered resistances. Goncagul et al.
(2004) have investigated antimicrobial resistance pro-
files of Salmonella Enteritidis isolates from chicken
meat and found that four of the isolates had multi-drug
resistance to ampicillin, sulphamethoxazole/trimetho-
prim and chloramphenicol. Molla et al. (2003) have
reported that 51 (63.7%) of the 80 Salmonella strains
isolated from chicken carcasses, and giblets were
resistant
to one or more antimicrobials including
sulfisoxazole, spectinomycin, amoxicillin/clavulanic
acid, ampicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, florfe-
nicol and streptomycin. The high levels of resistant
Salmonella isolates to one or more antimicrobials in
present study and previous studies may be due to
the worldwide overuse of antimicrobials in different
fields.

Cui (2004) has isolated 27 (44%) Salmonella from
61 chicken samples and found that
the 100%
Salmonella Typhimurium were resistant to amoxicil-
lin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cephalothin, ceptiofur
and cefoxitin. On the contrary, all Salmonella isolates
were susceptible to ampicillin, amoxicillin, ciproflox-
acin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin and
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim in the present study.
This may be explained by the limited availability and
high cost of the antimicrobials that would reduce their
frequent utilisation in veterinary practise in Turkey.

In a previous study, 80 Salmonella isolates were
recovered from chicken carcasses and identified 15
serotypes including Salmonella Hadar (9%), Salmo-
nella Typhimurium (4%) and Salmonella Enteritidis
(1%). It was shown that 43.75% of the isolates were
resistant to one or more antimicrobial, and 36% were
determined as multi-drug resistant. Moreover, 100%
of Salmonella Hadar had resistance to streptomycin
and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim while Salmonella
Typhimurium and Salmonella Enteritidis had no
resistance (Berrang et al. 2006). These results are in
agreement with our results for antimicrobial resistance
pattern of Salmonella Hadar, Salmonella Typhimu-
rium, and Salmonella Enteritidis.

The results of the present study are supported by
some previous studies. Zewdu and Cornelius (2009)
have investigated 29 Salmonella isolates from 208
chicken carcasses, identified 32.7% of them resistant to
one or more antimicrobials and determined 100% of
Salmonella Hadar as multiresistant to streptomycin and
tetracycline. Similarly, antimicrobial resistance patterns
of Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Hadar isolat-
ed from chicken carcasses reported by Bada-Alambedji
et al. (2006) in Senegal. Their isolates were resistant to
a variety of the antimicrobials including cephalothin,
nalidixic acid and tetracycline.

The high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance of
Salmonella spp. is probably due to wide spread uses of
the common antimicrobials in the veterinary medicine.
Also, the accessibility to various antimicrobials without
a prescription can be another possible underlying
reason together with the unconscious usage. Differ-
ences of the resistance percentage between the present
study and the previous ones can be possibly attributed
to the use of different antimicrobials as therapheutics,
prophylactic agents or growth promoters in Turkey.

The results of this study indicated that the resistance
of Salmonella spp. to commonly used antimicrobials is

Trop Anim Health Prod (2010) 42:893–897

relatively high in chicken carcasses and has emerged as
a significant public health problem in Turkey. The use
of antimicrobials as prophylactics or growth promoter
agents must be limited and monitoring systems should
be continued regularly.
