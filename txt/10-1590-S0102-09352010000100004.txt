Virulence factors, antimicrobial resistance, and plasmid content of Escherichia coli 

isolated in swine commercial farms

ABSTRACT 

 
Virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance patterns of Escherichia coli isolates were evaluated. A total 
of 80 E. coli isolates were evaluated, being 64 from clinical samples (intestinal content and fragments of 
organs  from  diarrheic  piglets),  seven  from  feces  of  clinically  healthy  piglets  and  sows,  and  nine 
environmental  samples  (five  from  facilities,  two  from  feed,  one  from  insect,  and  one  from  waste). 
Molecular  characterization  was  performed  by  PCR  detection  of  fimbriae  and  toxin  genes  and  plasmid 
content determination. The isolates were also characterized according to their resistance or sensitivity to 
the  following  drugs:  ampicillin,  trimethoprim:sulfamethoxazole,  tetracycline,  amikacine,  colistin, 
norfloxacin,  florfenicol,  enrofloxacin,  cefalexin, 
trimethoprim,  neomycin,  chloramphenicol,  and 
gentamicin. From 80 E. coli isolates, 53.8% were classified as enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), 2.5% were 
shiga toxin-producing  E.  coli (STEC), and 43.8% showed  a non specific pattern and  were unclassified. 
One  fecal  isolate  from  non-diarrheic  piglet  was  classified  as  ETEC  by  PCR.  Clinical  isolates  showed 
resistance mainly for tetracycline and trimethoprim:sulfamethoxazole. Plasmidial DNA was observed in 
70 isolates, being 78.5% of clinical isolates, 8.57% of non-diarrheic feces, and 12.8% of environment.  

RESUMO 

 

Os  fatores  de  virulência  e  a  resistência  aos  antimicrobianos  foram  avaliados  em  Escherichia  coli.  Um 
total de 80 isolados de E. coli, sendo 64 de amostras clínicas (conteúdo intestinal e fragmentos de órgãos 
de leitões diarreicos), sete das fezes de porcas e leitões saudáveis e nove de amostras ambientais (cinco 
de  instalações,  dois  de  alimentos,  um  de  inseto  e  um  de  esterqueira).  A  caracterização  molecular  feita 
pela  PCR  objetivou  detectar  fimbrias  e  toxinas,  bem  como a  determinação  do  conteúdo de  plasmídeos. 
Os isolados foram caracterizados quanto à resistência ou sensibilidade às seguintes drogas: ampicilina, 
sulfazotrim,  tetraciclina,  amikacina,  colistina,  norfloxacina,  florfenicol,  enrofloxacina,  cefalexina, 
trimetoprim, neomicina, cloranfenicol e gentamicina. Dos 80 isolados, 53,8% foram classificados como 
E. coli enterotoxigênica (ETEC), 2,5% como E. coli produtora de shiga toxina (STEC) e 43,8%, por não 
apresentarem  padrão  específico,  não  foram  classificadas. Pela  PCR,  um  isolado  de  fezes  de  suíno  sem 
diarreia foi classificado como ETEC. Os isolados das amostras clínicas foram principalmente resistentes 
à  tetraciclina  e  à  sulfazotrim.  Em  70  isolados,  observaram-se  DNA  plasmidial,  destes  78,5%  foram 
obtidos de amostras clínicas, 8,57% de leitões sadios e 12,8% de amostras ambientais.

INTRODUCTION 

 

and 

diarrhea 

post-weaning 

Neonatal  colibacillosis  is  one  of  the  important 
disease  of  swine  herds  around 
the  world 
(Blickwede  and  Schwarz,  2004;  Hart  et  al., 
2004).  Different  pathotypes  are  associated  with 
neonatal 
as 
enterotoxigenic  Escherichia  coli  (ETEC)  and 
attaching-effacing  or  enteropathogenic  E.  coli 
(AEEC). The edema disease is caused by a Shiga 
toxin-producing  E.  coli  (STEC).  These  diseases 
are associated with high mortality rates in young 
piglets (Choi et al., 2002; Hariharan et al., 2004). 
ETEC adheres to small intestine by fimbriae (F4, 
F5,  F6,  F41,  and  F18)  and  produce  enterotoxins 
(STa, STb, and LT) that interact with enterocytes 
causing  water  and  electrolytes  hyper  secretion 
and  impairing  nutrient  absorption  (Bertschinger 
and  Fairbrother,  1999;  Amezcua  et  al.,  2002). 
The  hemolysins  are  considered  an  important 
marker  of  ETEC  virulence  from  swine  (Docic 
and  Bilkei,  2003).  The  piglet  contamination 
occurs  from  sow  or  environmental  contact  and 
the disease produces very high mortality rates in 
the  first  12  hours  of  life.  Host  susceptibility  is 
associated to several factors such as the presence 
of  intestinal  E.  coli  fimbriae  receptors,  poor 
hygiene, stress, and colostrum ingestion quantity 
(Bertschinger and Fairbrother, 1999).   
 
Antimicrobials  have  been  commonly  used  to 
control  and  prevent  E.  coli  infections  in  swine 
herds  (Docic  and  Bilkei,  2003;  Hariharan  et  al., 
2004;  Kummerer,  2004).  However,  the  abusive 
administration  of  the  antimicrobial  drugs  causes 
many problems as residual contamination of pork 
meat  and  potential  risks  for  consumers  (Dunlop 
et al., 1999; Beier et al., 2005). Considering that 
human, bovine, and swine ecosystems are highly 
interconnected  by  food  production  chain,  the 
dissemination  of  resistant  bacteria  should  be 
avoided  (Petersen  et  al.,  2002;  Parveen  et  al., 
2006; Schierack et al., 2006). 
 
The occurrence of multi-resistant E. coli isolates 
has  rapidly  increased  in  recent  years  (Schroeder 
et  al.,  2002).  In  swine,  a  survey  performed  in 
Sweden  for  the  detection  of  STEC,  showed  the 
presence  of  strains  with  high  resistance  to 
tetracyclines, 
and 
streptomycin,  drugs  widely  used  as  grow 
promoters  (Sherley  et  al.,  2004).  Similar  results 
were  also  reported  in  E.  coli  isolates  from  beef 
cattle and poultry (Hart et al., 2004). Significant

differences 
susceptibility 
patterns  were  found  between  swine  ETEC  and 
commensal  bacteria,  showing  that  sick  animals 
are  important  sources  of  resistant  bacteria  to 
healthy animals (Boerlin et al., 2005).  
 
Plasmids carrying multiple drug resistance genes 
are  frequently  detected  in  E.  coli  (Schroeder  et 
al.,  2002;  Schierack  et  al.,  2006).  Plasmids  may 
carry genes with different functions as: antibiotic 
resistance,  adhesins,  toxins,  resistance  to  heavy 
metals,  and  assimilation  of  unusual  nutrients 
(Schroeder  et  al.,  2002).  Therefore, 
the 
antimicrobial  therapy  may  not  be  the  unique 
selection  pressure  to  raise  resistant  bacteria  and 
the  use  of  disinfectants  could  be  considered 
important  to  co-selection  of  pathogenic  resistant 
bacteria  to  antimicrobial  compounds  (Yates  et 
al.,  2004; Wallmann,  2006). The  co-selection  of 
genes  coding  for  resistance  and  enterotoxin 
production  was  reported  as  well  as  the  multiple 
antimicrobial  drugs  resistance  among  clinical 
isolates (Dunlop et al., 1999). In many cases, the 
resistance to some antibiotic may be extended to 
the  others  (Blickwede  and  Schwarz,  2004; 
Harada et al., 2006).  
 
The  drug  resistance  of  E.  coli  isolates  is  a  very 
important  issue  and  this  problem  can  only  be 
solved  by  interdisciplinary  efforts  (Stephan  and 
Schumacher,  2001).  The  correct  use  of 
antimicrobial 
is  very 
important to reduce possible failures (Choi et al., 
2002).  According  to  Dunlop  et  al.  (1998),  a 
reduction  in  the  use  of  growth  promoters  can 
help to minimize the dissemination of resistant E. 
coli  for  both  the  environment  and  the  man. 
However,  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  once 
acquired  by  E.  coli  the  resistance  genes  are  not 
rapidly  lost  (Enne  et  al.,  2005).  The  aim  of  the 
present  study  was  to  characterize  the  virulence 
and  the  drug  resistance  profile  of  swine  E.  coli 
isolates from Santa Catarina, Brazil.

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

 
E.  coli  strains  were  isolated  from  clinical  cases 
of  neonatal  colibacillosis  (intestine  contents  and 
fragments of liver and lungs), from non-diarrheic 
piglets and sows feces, and from the environment 
(feed,  insects,  and  facilities  waste).  Samples 
were  collected  from  swine  breeding  farms  in 
Santa  Catarina  state,  Brazil,  in  sterile  bags  and 
swabs,  and  were  transported  in  Stuart  modified

Plasmidial  extraction  from  E.  coli  isolates  was 
performed  by  alkaline 
lysis,  as  previously 
described  (Birnboim  and  Doly,  1979).  The

were  streaked  on  ovine  blood  agar  and  Mac 
Conkey agar and were kept at 37oC for 48 hours. 
Putative  E.  coli  colonies  were  identified  by 
morphology  and  biochemical  tests  according  to 
Quinn et al. (1994). One E. coli colony was used 
to DNA extraction and sensitivity test. 
 
The Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion test (Bauer et al., 
1966;  Performance…,  1999)  was  used 
to 
determine the resistance to antimicrobial drugs of

amplification  of  the  follows  regions:  STa,  STb, 
LT, STx F4, F5, F6, F41, and F18, as previously 
described  (Costa  et  al.,  2006).  The  presence  of 
attaching-effacing E. coli (AEEC) was evaluated, 
as described by Nakazato et al. (2004). The PCR 
reactions  were  performed  in  25µL  reactions 
containing  100ng  DNA 
template,  primers 
(30pmol  each),  Taq  buffer  (10mM  Tris,  50mM 
KCl,  2.5mM  MgCl2),  200mM  dNTPs,  and  1U

Virulence factors, antimicrobial… 

From the 64 clinical isolates, 43 were classified as 
ETEC  and  two  as  STEC.  Nineteen  E.  coli  clinical 
isolates gave negative results in the multiplex PCR 
for  virulence  markers  and  could  not  be  typified. 
One  isolate  from  feces  of  healthy  swine  was 
classified as ETEC. None isolate was confirmed as 
AEEC in this study.  
 
In the clinical isolates, the most prevalent virulence 
factors were STb (27), LT (23), F18 (17), F4 (12), 
and STa (13). F18, 987P, and F4 were described to 
diarrheic  piglets  in  Brazil  (Macêdo  et  al.,  2007). 
Thirteen  clinical  isolates  presented  LT  and  STb 
genes,  six  isolates  only  the  STb  gene,  and  six 
isolates  the  STa  and  STb  genes.  The  detection  of 
genes  coding  for  all  enterotoxins  was  observed  in 
two  isolates.  According  to  Celemin  et  al.  (1995), 
the  enterotoxin  coding  genes  LT  and  STb,  or  LT, 
STa,  and  STb  are  expected  to  be  found  in  ETEC. 
The same findings were found in the study made by 
Macêdo et al. (2007) in diarrheic piglets, in which 
where  LT  and  STb  were  the  prevalent  virotype. 
Only in one isolate from non-diarrheic piglet feces 
the  STb  gene  was  detected  by  PCR.  Therefore,  E. 
coli  isolates  from  healthy  swine  and  environment 
samples  show  a  lower  pathogenic  potential.  The 
STb alone causes only lost of fluids on the piglets 
intestinal mucosa, without drastic effects proper of 
colibacillosis  diarrhea 
(Casey  et  al.,  1998). 
However,  the  pathogenicity  of  ETEC  may  be 
 
 
Table 2. Percent of resistant Escherichia coli isolates from clinical, non-diarrheic swines, and environment to 
antimicrobial drugs 

increased  by  associated 
infections  with  other 
intestinal  pathogens  (Nakamine  et  al.,  1998).  New 
vaccines  strategies  are  being  developed,  using 
fimbrial  and  enterotoxins  purified  from  E.  coli 
(Bertschinger and Fairbrother, 1999). Therefore, the 
knowledge  of  the  molecular  patterns  of  E.  coli 
isolates is very important. 
 
The  determination  of 
the  pathogenic  bacteria 
susceptibility  patterns  to  antimicrobial  drugs  is 
important to guide the therapy, that will reduce the 
economic loses due to E. coli infections (Choi et al., 
2002;  Hariharan  et  al.,  2004).  The  resistance 
patterns  of  E.  coli  isolates  from  Santa  Catarina 
State are presented in Table 2. The majority of the 
clinical  E.  coli  isolates  revealed  resistance  to 
tetracycline  and 
trimethoprim:sulfamethoxazole 
(P<0.05)  and  very  few  isolates  were  resistant  to 
florfenicol.  These  results  are  in  accordance  to 
others studies that evaluated the resistance patterns 
of E. coli isolates from slaughtered swine, specially 
to  susceptibility  to  florfenicol  and  resistance  to 
tetracycline  and 
trimethoprim:sulfamethoxazole 
(Hariharan et al., 2004; Hart et al., 2004; Sherley et 
al.,  2004;  Beier  et  al., 2005; Macêdo  et  al., 2007). 
From  eighty  E.  coli  evaluated  isolates,  52  (65%) 
were  simultaneously  resistant  to  four  or  more 
antimicrobial groups. This criterion is considered to 
multi-drug resistant isolates (Rjavek et al., 2006).

to  animal  production 

Boerlim  et  al.  (2005)  found  a  significant 
difference in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns 
among  pathogenic  and  commensal  E.  coli 
isolates.  In  this  study,  the  resistance  was  higher 
for all E. coli isolates tested and non-significative 
(P>0.05)  differences  were  detected  and  were 
related to the source of those samples (diarrheic, 
non-diarrheic  piglets,  and  environment).  The 
drugs  tested  in  the  present  study  are  widely 
employed 
in  Brazil, 
including  confined  cattle  (Bastos  et  al.,  2006; 
Pigatto et al., 2008). The improper veterinary use 
of these drugs increases the resistance to animal 
pathogenic bacteria and could generate impact to 
human  health  by  food  and  feces  residues  from 
swine herds (Petersen et al., 2002; Parveen et al., 
2006;  Schierack  et  al.,  2006).  The  potential  risk 
of  the  dissemination  of  resistant  bacteria  from 
animal  farming  to  the  environment  and  the  man 
was  established  by  detection  and  determination 
of conjugative plasmids in bacteria isolated from 
water  (Petersen  et  al.,  2002),  meat  producing 
animals,  and  man  (Schierack  et  al.,  2006). 
According  to  Wallmann  (2006),  strategies  to 
avoid  the  spread  of  resistance  to  antimicrobial 
drugs involve the control of antimicrobial use in 
the food-producing chain. 
 
Plasmid was observed in 55 (85.9%) clinical and 
six  (85.7%)  non-diarrheic  feces  and  in  nine 
(100%)  environmental  E.  coli  isolates  (data  not 
shown).  The  plasmid  occurrence  was  higher 
among  clinical  isolates  showing  simultaneous 
resistance from five to seven antimicrobial drugs. 
Plasmids  in  E.  coli  carry  multiple  resistance 
genes. The higher resistance of E. coli is related 
to  wide  distribution  of  bacteria  and  ability  to 
maintain  mobile  genetic  elements  (Blickwede 
and Schwarz, 2004; Yates et al., 2004; Harada et 
al.,  2006;  Schierack  et  al.,  2006).  The  co-
selection 
enterotoxin 
production  genes  were  reported,  as  well  as  the 
multiple  antimicrobial  drugs  resistance  among 
clinical  isolates  (Dunlop  et  al.,  1999).  Many 
clinical  and  environmental  E.  coli 
isolates 
revealed multiple resistances even in the absence 
of  plasmidial  DNA.  The 
to 
antimicrobial  drugs  may  be  associated  to  others 
different  genetic  mechanisms.  Chromossomal 
mediated  resistance  genes  are  described  for 
several 
as 
enrofloxacin  beta 
lactams  and  biocides,  as 
chlorexidine  (Piddock  et  al.,  1998;  Beier  et  al., 
2005).

CONCLUSIONS 

 
Multi  resistance  was  detected  among  E.  coli 
isolates.  The  majority  of  E.  coli  isolates  were 
molecularly  characterized  as  ETEC,  by  using  a 
multiplex  PCR  technique.  The  most  frequent 
virulence factors were STb and LT.
