The main objective of the study was to assess the microbiological quality of milk at diﬀerent stages of the dairy
value chain from farm to the factory in Bangladesh. A total of 438 raw milk samples (387 from primary pro-
ducers, 32 from collectors, 15 from chilling plants, 4 from local restaurants) and 95 commercially processed milk
samples were collected from northern part of Bangladesh. Almost 72% (n = 280) of samples at producer level
and 100% from both collectors (n = 32) and chilling plants (n = 15) were contaminated with coliforms while
57% (n = 220) of samples from producers, 91% (n = 29) of samples from collectors and 100% (n = 15) from
chilling plants were contaminated with fecal coliforms. Around 31% (n = 119) of samples from producers were
positive for E. coli whereas > 60% (n = 20) and 100% (n = 15) samples from collectors and chilling plants,
respectively were positive for E. coli. One quarter of samples from collectors were positive for B. cereus and
coagulase positive staphylococci and 33% (n = 5) of samples from chilling plants were positive for both of these
microorganisms. In case of commercially processed milk, 77% (n = 46) and 37% (n = 22) of pasteurized milk
samples had a high aerobic plate count (APC) (104 CFU/ml) and coliform count (> 10 CFU/ml), respectively.
None of the samples was positive for Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., and Campylobacter spp. Among 158 E. coli
positive raw milk samples, 9% (n = 14) contained pathogenic E. coli, and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) and
Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC) were found to be the predominant pathotypes. Of the 23 pathogenic E. coli
identiﬁed from 14 samples based on their gene contents, > 95% (n = 22) were resistant to at least one antibiotic
and 13% (n = 3) of isolates were resistant to ≥3 classes of antibiotics. Several factors including the time of
milking, hygiene practices of the producers, cow breed and amount of milk produced by the cow were found to
be signiﬁcantly associated with high APC of milk samples. In conclusion, both raw and commercially pasteurized
milk are highly contaminated with fecal organisms. For intervention, more emphasis should be given at pro-
ducer's level as microorganisms introduced to milk at this stage get the longest time for survival and multi-
plication.

1. Introduction

Milk is a complex biological ﬂuid which by nature serves as an
excellent growth medium for many microorganisms (Godič Torkar and
Golc Teger, 2008). It contains a wide range of nutrients including vi-
tamins, proteins, fats and carbohydrates and therefore, nutritionally
supports many diﬀerent microorganisms under suitable growth condi-
tions (Godefay and Molla, 2000; Parekh and Subhash, 2008). Milk

contaminated with high level of spoilage bacteria often becomes un-
suitable for further processing (Mhone et al., 2011). Microbial con-
tamination can generally occur from various sources during the milking
procedure: from within the udder, from the exterior of the udder, from
the surface of milk handling and storage equipment and from milkmen
if milking is done manually (Bramley and McKinnon, 1990; Oliver
et al., 2005).

Microbiologically qualiﬁed milk means that the milk is free from

pathogenic bacteria and harmful and toxic products of bacteria and that
it is low in total bacterial counts. Total viable bacterial count is con-
sidered as one of the acceptance criteria for categorizing milk for
human consumption and processing for dairy products (PMO, 2015). In
most countries, the legal limits for total viable bacterial count in pas-
teurized milk range from 5 × 103 to 5 × 105 CFU/ml (Shojaei and
Yadollahi, 2008). In Bangladesh, the acceptance limit for viable bac-
teria in pasteurized milk is ≤2 × 104 CFU/ml (BSTI, 2002). Among the
coliforms, Escherichia coli is the most common contaminant of raw and
processed milk and is a reliable indicator of fecal contamination (Kumar
and Prasad, 2010). E. coli is a commensal microorganism inhabiting the
intestine of animals and humans but its recovery from food may be of
public health concern due to the possible presence of enteropathogenic
and/or toxigenic bacteria, for instance, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli.
Staphylococcus aureus, another important causative agent of food-borne
diseases in humans is commonly associated with intoxications of food
through its capacity to produce diﬀerent kinds of potent enterotoxins
(Balaban and Rasooly, 2000; Le Loir et al., 2003). Although heat may
kill S. aureus cells, the enterotoxin may persist in food because it is more
heat stable than the bacteria (Banwart, 1998). Bacillus cereus is a ubi-
quitous Gram-positive, spore-forming, motile rod, which is also re-
sponsible for spoilage of raw milk. It is also frequently found in pas-
teurized milk, causing deterioration of milk quality by producing
lipases and proteases (Cromie et al., 1989; Meer et al., 1991).

In industrial countries, milk is produced at a commercial scale in
dairy farms and collected through automated systems and further
processing is done by maintaining good hygienic practices. However, in
Bangladesh, milk is produced mostly in unorganized and informal ways.
Even though very small proportion of milk is going to commercial
processors, one of the biggest hurdles is to ensure safety and quality of
milk all the way from the producers to the processing factory and to
consumers. In this study, we aimed to assess the microbiological quality
of raw milk through diﬀerent stages of formal supply chain starting
from the primary producer to the milk chilling stations of diﬀerent
commercial milk processing industries located in the northeast part of
Bangladesh. Same assessment was done for commercially processed
milk samples collected from retail outlets. In addition, factors asso-
ciated with contamination of milk at the primary producer's level were
investigated.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sampling site and sample collection

This study was conducted in 18 upazillas of 7 districts located in
northern part of Bangladesh, including Bogra, Gaibandha, Nilphamari,
Dinajpur, Joypurhat, Rangpur and Sirajganj. We collected a total of 438
milk samples of which 387 were from the primary producers (farmer),
32 from collectors (pooling points), 15 from chilling plants and 4 from
local restaurants. The district and upazilla-wise distribution of milk
samples are illustrated in Fig. 1. We determined the number of samples
collected from each level of the value chain based on the study popu-
lation enrolled in “Strengthening Dairy Value Chain (SDVC) project”.
The SDVC project was carried out by an international Non-Govern-
mental Organization (NGO) called CARE Bangladesh (http://www.
carebangladesh.org). During the time of our study, the total number
of producers/farmers in the SDVC area was 15,309 and they were
clustered in 519 small groups, distributed in nine districts.

For this study, we randomly selected a proportionate number of
groups from each district with 6 producers per group. Of these 6 pro-
ducers, we collected samples from 4 producers based on their avail-
ability and convenience. Accordingly, we selected 95 groups from
which 570 (95 × 6) producers were initially included in the study, and
ﬁnally samples were collected from 387 producers. We sampled one
cow per producer and accordingly collected milk samples from 387
cows. We collected approximately 200 ml of milk in a sterile plastic bag

(Fisher Scientiﬁc, China) by pouring milk out of a bucket immediately
after milking the cow. We did not interrupt the normal timing and
practice of milking which was in maximum cases the early morning and
manual expression through hands.

In case of collection points, we followed the distribution chain from
producers to collectors. We selected all collection points within the
SDVC project area that collect milk from producers enrolled in our
study (producers/collection point: minimum 4; maximum 29; median
13). Accordingly, we selected 32 collection points for sampling.

In case of chilling plants, we included all plants that collected milk
samples from producers/collectors (producers/chilling plant: minimum
5; maximum 68; median 19 and collection points/chilling plant:
minimum 1; maximum 4; median 1) enrolled in our study. A total of 15
chilling plants were included for sample collection.

As we selected primary producers within the SDVC project, majority
of them deliver milk to collectors who supply the bulk to chilling plants
belonged to diﬀerent milk processing industries (formal chain). Only a
few producers were found who sell milk to the local restaurants (in-
formal chain). A total of 4 restaurants that used to receive milk from the
producer groups enrolled in our study were identiﬁed, 3 of these were
located in Bogra and one in Joypurhat district (Fig. 1). We collected
milk samples from these restaurants at the point of reception.

We collected milk samples by maintaining an aseptic condition. Like
at the primary producers, we collected at least 200 ml of milk from each
of the collection points as well as the chilling plants in a sterile sam-
pling bag (Fisher Scientiﬁc, China) and immediately placed them in a
cool box having a temperature of +4 to +8 °C. Unlike primary pro-
ducers, samples collected at collection points and chilling plants com-
prised milk originating from diﬀerent producers. All samples were
transported to the lab maintaining the cool chain for 6–8 h after col-
lection and stored at +4 °C until analyzing of the samples. All samples
were tested within 18–24 h of sample collection.

In addition to raw milk samples, we collected 95 commercially
processed pasteurized milk (n = 60) and UHT milk (n = 35) from retail
shops mostly located in Dhaka and Bogra. We collected products of
those industries which have their chilling plants in the sampling area,
including all medium and large size dairy industries in Bangladesh. For
each product, we purchased 1–2 sealed packets of milk depending on
the pack size so that we got at least 200 ml of product for analysis. We
ensured that all products had diﬀerent batch numbers and were within
their shelf-life as labeled by the industry. All samples were placed in a
cool box and transported to the laboratory by maintaining a cold chain
for 6–8 h after collection.

2.2. Questionnaire-based survey

A questionnaire-based survey among all primary producers was
carried out to determine factors associated with microbiological con-
tamination of milk at primary producer level. Data were collected
mainly related to the breeding type of cow, volume of milk produced by
the cow, environmental condition surrounding the cattle house, con-
struction materials of cattle house ﬂoor, type of food supplied to the
cattle, source of drinking water for cattle, educational status of the
farmer, time of milking, hygienic condition during milking and type of
milk pot used for milking.

2.3. Microbiological analysis

All milk samples including both raw and commercially processed
ones were tested for aerobic plate count (APC), lab pasteurized count
(LPC), total coliform count (TC), thermotolerant coliform (fecal coli-
forms) count (FC), and enumeration of β-glucuronidase positive E. coli,
Bacillus cereus and coagulase positive staphylococci by using standard
methods described in the following. In addition, all samples were tested
for foodborne pathogens including Shigella spp., Salmonella spp. and
spp. using standard method as described in the
Campylobacter

following.

Ten milliliters from each milk sample were transferred into a sterile
plastic bag. Then 90 ml of peptone salt solution were added and mixed
well in a stomacher to get a 1:10 dilution. Subsequent dilutions of the
sample were prepared by transferring 1 ml from the initial dilution to
9 ml of peptone salt solution (1:100 dilution) and so on up to 1:100,000
dilution.

2.3.1. Enumeration of indicator organisms

For APC, 1 ml of each dilution of a sample ranging from neat (un-
diluted) to 1:100,000 dilution was transferred to separate sterile Petri
dishes and 15 ml of standard plate count agar (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK)
medium cooled to 45 ± 1 °C was added to each plate followed by
immediate mixing of the sample dilutions and agar medium by pour
plate technique (BAM, 2001).The plates were incubated at 35 ± 2 °C
for 48 h ± 2 h promptly after solidiﬁcation of molten agar. For enu-
meration of coliform, 1 ml of each dilution of a sample was mixed with
crystal violet neutral red bile lactose agar (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK)
using pour plate technique. The plates were incubated at 37 °C ac-
cording to the standard method (Anonymous, 2006a). Both typical and
atypical colonies were counted and atypical colonies were conﬁrmed by
inoculating in brilliant green lactose bile broth (Oxoid, Basingstoke,
UK). Colonies those produced gas in the Durham tubes were considered
as coliform bacteria (Anonymous, 2006a). For fecal coliform, 100 μl of
milk sample was inoculated directly onto membrane fecal coliform (m-
FC) agar (Difco™, USA) supplemented with rosalic acid (600 μl/ 300 ml
mixed in 1 N NaOH) using spread plate technique. The plates were
incubated at 44o C for 18–24 h. For lab pasteurized count (LPC), milk
samples were heated to 145 °F (62.8 °C) and held at that temperature
for 30 min. Then the samples were inoculated in a similar way of
aerobic plate count and the plates were incubated at 35 ± 2 °C for
48 h ± 2 h after solidiﬁcation of molten agar. For enumeration of β-
glucuronidase positive E. coli, 1 ml of diluted sample was inoculated on
tryptone bile agar with x-glucuronide (TBX) (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK)

and incubated at 44 °C for 18–24 h according to standard method
(Anonymous, 2001). Appearance of blue green colonies on TBX plate
was indicative of the presence of E. coli. For enumeration of Bacillus
cereus and coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus, 100 μl aliquots of
the same dilutions were inoculated onto mannitol egg yolk polymyxin
agar (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) and Baird-Parker agar medium (Oxoid,
Basingstoke, UK), respectively by spread plate technique and incubated
at speciﬁc conditions as mentioned in Table 1 (Anonymous, 2004a;
Anonymous, 1999). For all the tests, duplicate plates were used for each
dilution. The colony counts were calculated according to the standard
formula given in ISO 7218 and presented as CFU per ml of sample
(Anonymous, 2007).

2.3.2. Detection and isolation of pathogenic bacteria

For isolation and identiﬁcation of Shigella spp., Salmonella spp. and
Campylobacter spp., the same amount of sample (25 ml) were taken for
each of the organisms and mixed with selective enrichment media
(225 ml) according to the standard method (Anonymous, 2002;
Anonymous, 2004b; Anonymous, 2006b) (Table 1). Only for Salmonella
spp., a pre-enrichment of the sample was carried out at 37 ± 1 °C for
18–24 h in buﬀered peptone water (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK). The se-
lective enrichment cultures were subsequently inoculated onto selective
agar plates and incubated at speciﬁc conditions mentioned in Table 1.
Typical colonies on culture plates were identiﬁed according to the
standard procedures. All presumptive colonies of Shigella spp., and
Salmonella spp., were identiﬁed by using API 20E biochemical test
galleries (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) according to the manu-
facturer's instructions.

2.4. Detection of virulence genes in E. coli isolates by PCR

From each E. coli positive samples, 5 colonies with blue green ap-
pearance on TBX plate were randomly selected and sub-cultured on
MacConkey agar. We then tested these 5 isolates by PCR for virulence

genes by using colony patch approach described in Islam et al., 2007.
Brieﬂy, single colonies were transferred from the MacConkey agar and
plated onto trypticase soya agar (Difco) to create a grid pattern of 96
colonies (12 × 8). The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C. The
isolates were subjected to PCR for the detection of virulence genes as
described below. DNA was extracted by boiling the suspensions of
pooled colonies for 10 min (Islam et al., 2006) and 3 μl of the super-
natant was used in the PCR. We used these DNA for detection of viru-
lence genes in two multiplex setup, one for heat labile (lt), heat stable
(st), attaching and eﬀacing gene (eae), bundle forming pilus (bfp), an-
tiaggregation protein transporter gene (aat) and genes for AggR-acti-
vated island (aaiC), invasion plasmid antigen H (ipaH) and invasion
associated locus (ial) and the other one for Shiga toxin genes (stx1 and
stx2) according to the procedures and programs described earlier
(Talukdar et al., 2013; Islam et al., 2007). For the ﬁrst multiplex PCR,
3 μl template DNA was suspended in 22 μl of reaction mix containing
2.5 μl of 10× PCR buﬀer with 1.5 mM MgCl2 (New England Biolabs),
0.5 μl of 10 mM dNTPs (New England Biolabs), 0.4 μl each of lt, st, bfp,
aat, aaiC, ipaH, ial primers, 0.44 μl of eae primers (Integrated DNA
Technologies), together with 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (New
England Biolabs) (5 U/μl). PCR cycling conditions consisted of initial
denaturation at 96 °C for 4 min, followed by 34 cycles each of dena-
turation at 95 °C for 20s, annealing at 57 °C for 20s and extension at
72 °C for 1 min (Talukdar et al., 2013). PCR for stx1 and stx2 genes was
carried out using the same volume of reaction mix (25 μl) comprising
2.5 μl of 10× PCR buﬀer with 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 μl of 10 mM dNTPs,
0.2 pmol of each primers, 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase and 3 μl of
template DNA. Primer sequences are listed in Table 2. Colonies that

appeared positive for a particular gene in pooled PCR were further
conﬁrmed by individual colony PCR.

2.5. Antimicrobial susceptibility test

Antimicrobial susceptibility of all pathogenic E. coli isolates was
determined by standard disk diﬀusion technique following the Clinical
and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines (CLSI, 2010). The anti-
biotics used in this study were ampicillin (10 μg), cefotaxime (30 μg),
ciproﬂoxacin (5 μg), nalidixic acid (30 μg),
trimethoprim/sulfa-
methoxazole (25 μg), aztreonam (30 μg), gentamicin (10 μg), kana-
mycin (30 μg), piperacillin-tazobactam (110 μg), chloramphenicol
(30 μg), tetracycline (30 μg) and erythromycin (15 μg). The inhibition
zones were measured and isolates were classiﬁed as resistant, inter-
mediate or sensitive according to the interpretation guideline provided
by the CLSI (CLSI, 2010).

2.6. Data analysis

Data collected from the ﬁeld were coded, and visually checked for
errors before entering into a database. Computer coding was pre-tested,
and data entry and analyses were done using Statistical Package for
Social Sciences (SPSS) Windows (Version 22; Chicago, IL, USA), Epi
Info (Version 6.0, USD, Stone Mountain, GA, USA), and RStudio
(Version 1.0.136.0). All data were validated by a series of logical and
range checks, and statistical analyses included both descriptive and
analytical methods. For categorical variables of interest, diﬀerences
between categories were compared by χ2 test and probability of < 0.05

was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant. Finally, backward step-
wise regression analyses were performed simultaneously adjusting for
confounding variables for identifying factors that independently inﬂu-
enced the outcome.

3. Results

3.1. Raw milk samples collected from diﬀerent points of milk value chain
were highly contaminated

Almost 72% and 57% of raw milk samples, collected from primary
producers were contaminated with coliform (≥100 CFU/ml) and fecal
coliform (≥100 CFU/ml), respectively while 31% of samples were po-
sitive for E. coli and one in every ten samples (11%) was contaminated
with high numbers of E. coli (≥100 CFU/ml). Around 10% and 5% of
raw milk samples collected from producers were contaminated with B.
cereus and Staph. aureus, respectively (Fig. 2).

All samples at collection points were contaminated with a high
number of coliform bacteria (≥100 CFU/ml) and 91% of the samples
contained fecal coliform (≥100 CFU/ml). More than 60% of samples
were contaminated with E. coli and around 40% of samples had a high
E. coli count (≥100 CFU/ml). Around 25% of samples were positive for
B. cereus and coagulase positive staphylococci, however, in most of the
samples, number of organisms was within the acceptable limit
(< 104 CFU/ml) (de Oliveira et al., 2011; European Commission, 2001)
(Fig. 2).

The level of microbial contamination in samples collected from
chilling plants was even higher than that of collection points. Samples
from all 15 chilling plants distributed in 5 districts were contaminated
with high number of coliforms as well as fecal coliforms. E. coli was
present in samples from all chilling plants (100%) and high count of E.
coli was found in 67% of samples, mainly from chilling plants located in
Bogra, Joypurhat and Sirajganj districts. Although B. cereus and coa-
gulase positive staphylococci were detected in 33% of samples, the
number of B. cereus in all of the positive samples and number of sta-
phylococci in 27% of the samples was within the acceptable limits
(< 104 CFU/ml). None of the raw milk samples collected from produ-
cers, collectors and chilling plants was positive for Shigella spp.,
Salmonella spp., and Campylobacter spp.

Bacterial counts increased gradually from producer to chilling
plants/local restaurants (Fig. 3). All samples from chilling plants and
local restaurants had a higher APC, TC and FC (Fig. 3). Similarly, the

3.2. More than two-third of commercially processed pasteurized milk
samples did not meet standard microbiological limits

Around 77% of pasteurized milk samples had a high APC
(> 104 CFU/ml) while 37% and 15% of the samples were contaminated
with coliforms and fecal coliforms, respectively. More than 31% and
around 2% of pasteurized milk samples were found to be contaminated
with coliforms and fecal

3.3. A signiﬁcant proportion of organisms in raw milk might be thermoduric

All milk samples from producers, collectors and chilling plants were
tested for Laboratory Pasteurized Count (LPC) in order to enumerate
the thermoduric bacteria. While none of the samples from producers
had LPC in the range of 104 to 105 CFU/ml, around 10% of samples
from collection points and 8% from chilling plants had LPC in this range
(Table 3). Samples having high LPC also had high APC.

3.4. Raw milk contained pathogenic E. coli

Of the 158 E. coli positive raw milk samples, 14 samples (9%) were
positive for pathogenic E. coli. For detection of pathogenic E. coli, we
tested 5 E. coli colonies per sample for pathogenic genes. In some
samples (n = 6), we found more than one colonies positive for patho-
genic genes but of diﬀerent types, hence we considered them as dif-
ferent E. coli. Accordingly, we identiﬁed a total of 23 pathogenic E. coli
isolates from 14 samples. Of these 23 isolates, 9 isolates (39%) were
positive for EAEC speciﬁc genes, aaiC and aat, same number of isolates
(39%) were positive for STEC speciﬁc genes, stx1 and stx2, 3 isolates
(13%) were positive for EIEC speciﬁc genes, ipaH and ial. One isolate
was positive for EPEC speciﬁc gene (eae) and another one for ETEC
speciﬁc gene (st).

3.5. Pathogenic E. coli isolated from raw milk samples were resistant to
multiple antibiotics

3.6. Multiple factors were involved in contamination of milk at primary
producer level

Among the 23 pathogenic E. coli isolates, > 95% (n = 22) were
resistant to erythromycin followed by 13% (n = 3) to ampicillin and
9% (n = 2) to tetracycline and nalidixic acid. > 95% (n = 22) isolates
were resistant to at least one antibiotic and 13% (n = 3) of the isolates
were resistant to three or more classes of antibiotics and thus deﬁned as
multi-drug resistant (MDR).

A number of variables were found to be signiﬁcantly associated with
high APC of milk samples, including breed of the cow, volume of milk
produced by the cow, the time of milking, and farmer's hand washing
practices (Table 4). Signiﬁcantly higher number of samples from com-
mercial breed cow was contaminated than that of the local breed
(P = 0.012). Higher number of samples from small-scale producers
(who produce < 5 l of milk/day) were found to be contaminated than
that of the large-scale producers (who produce > 5 l of milk/day)

4. Discussion

Food safety is paramount for healthcare management of highly
congested and cognate settings such as Bangladesh. This becomes very
critical when food supply sectors such as dairy chains and their op-
erations remain unorganized and are not fully automated and regulated
and largely depend on human handling.

operations,

collection,

and

transportation

The total bacterial count could often serve as a surrogate of the
microbiological quality of milk, and reﬂects the standards of primary
production
storage
(Hassainya et al., 2006). In our study, more than one quarter (27%) of
milk samples at primary producer level had a high APC (≥105) whereas
100% of the milk samples from chilling plant had the same level of APC.
Presence of coliform bacteria is generally considered as an indicator of
poor hygienic practices in the handling of milk, while presence of E. coli
reﬂects fecal contamination or the presence of other enteric bacteria in
the samples (Labioui et al., 2009). In this study, we found that > 70%
of the samples taken from primary producers were contaminated with
high number of coliform bacteria (≥102) while 100% of samples taken
from chilling plants were contaminated with the same number of co-
liforms. E. coli contamination increased from 31% to 100% from pro-
ducer to chilling plant. B. cereus and S. aureus were found in 10% and
5% of samples obtained from primary producers, respectively, while
both organisms were found in 33% of samples from the chilling plants.
Presence of pathogenic E. coli in milk is more alarming as this might
potentially lead to an outbreak of foodborne infections in the commu-
nity, if milk is consumed in raw state or with inadequate treatment or
sterilization (Langer et al., 2012; Scavia et al., 2009). In this study, 9%
of E. coli positive samples were found to be positive for pathogenic E.
coli and the predominant pathotypes were EAEC and STEC. In a pre-
vious study from Bangladesh, around 10% raw milk samples were
found to be positive for STEC (Islam et al., 2010). A more recent study
conducted in Brazil showed that among 101 raw milk samples collected
from three diﬀerent dairy farms, 31.1% were contaminated with STEC
(Vendramin et al., 2014).

Antibiotic resistance is a global concern and inappropriate use of
antibiotics in the food chain is one of the major drivers of antimicrobial
resistance. In this study, we found that 95% of pathogenic E. coli iso-
lates were resistant to erythromycin, followed by 13% being resistant to
ampicillin, 9% to tetracycline as well as to nalidixic acid and only 4%
isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol, cefotaxime, trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole and aztreonam. Around 13% isolates were multi-drug
resistant. A previous study reported that among 120 E. coli isolates from
raw milk and unpasteurized cheese, 56% were resistant to nalidixic
acid, 30% to gentamicin, 28% to trimetoprim-sulfamethoxazole and
23.4% to ampicillin (Bonyadian et al., 2014). Another study revealed
all of the 19 E. coli O157 strains isolated from raw milk samples were
resistant to penicillin and tetracycline, 94.7% to erythromycin, 84.2%
to amoxicillin, oxacillin, sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim, 68.4% to
chloramphenicol and 42.1% to streptomycin (Reuben and Owuna,
2013). In contrast to these diverse studies, it appears that pathogenic E.
coli isolates obtained from our study were less resistant to antibiotics.
However, it might be interesting to analyse the non-pathogenic E. coli
isolates for antibiotic resistance as they could also act as sources of
many antibiotic resistance genes.

A signiﬁcant association was found between the APC and LPC of
milk samples collected from primary producers. Signiﬁcantly higher
number of samples with a high APC (> 105 CFU/ml) showed a higher
LPC (> 103 CFU/ml) compared to samples having a low APC

(P = 0.003). A signiﬁcant association between the time of milking and
microbial contamination was also found. Higher number of samples
collected in the morning was contaminated than the number of samples
collected at mid-day or in the evening (P = 0.008). Of the hygiene is-
sues, hand washing practices among people who milk the cow was
found to be signiﬁcantly associated with microbial contamination.
Higher number of samples from producers who washed their hands
only with water before milking was found to be contaminated than that
of the samples from producers who washed their hands with soap and
water (P = 0.034). In multivariate analysis, high APC of milk sample
was signiﬁcantly associated with volume of milk produced by the cow,
after controlling for other variables those appeared to be signiﬁcant in

(< 105 CFU/ml) (P < 0.05) (Table 3). This result indicates that a
major proportion of the total microbiota in milk could be thermoduric
meaning that it could survive pasteurization. An increasing trend of
samples with high LPC was observed from producers to chilling plants,
while an opposite trend was observed entailing the samples with low
LPC. All samples (100%) from chilling plants had a high APC
(> 105 CFU/ml) and half of them (47%) had high LPC values suggestive
of the possibility that thermoduric organisms thrived and dominated
signiﬁcantly. In order to ﬁnd out if it concurs with the commercially
processed milk in Bangladesh, we tested pasteurized milk samples of all
available brands obtained from retail outlets. We found that around
80% of pasteurized milk samples had a high total APC (> 104 CFU/ml)
and > 31% of samples were contaminated with coliform bacteria at a
level of > 10 CFU/ml. According to the Bangladesh standard, accepted
limit for viable bacteria in pasteurized milk is ≤2 × 104 CFU/ml (BSTI,
2002) indicating that a major proportion of commercially pasteurized
milk at the point of sale is not meeting the safety criteria. Seamless
surveillance and monitoring of the commercial milk value chain in the
country should be implemented.

We interpret that the contamination of milk originates from the
primary producer levels and ampliﬁes at subsequent stages. At the
primary producer level, contamination occurs due to soiled udders of
the cows, unhygienic practices of the farmers, such as milking with
dirty hands, use of unclean milk pots, wiping udder with cow tail, dirty
cloths, urination or defecation by the animal during milking and an
overall unclean environment. Soiled udders of cows are predominantly
seen in cows during morning time than the mid-day/evening time, and
this might be the reason that milk extracted during the morning hours
was more contaminated than milk extracted at evening time (Table 4).
Normally bathing/washing of cows is done at noon or in the afternoon
and thus body of the cow is cleaner in the evening than in the morning.
The unhygienic milking practices were observed to be more pre-
dominant among small scale farmers as majority of them are living in
poverty, marginalized and illiterate (SDVC project). This was also evi-
dent from multivariate analysis of the factors associated with milk
contamination which showed that signiﬁcantly higher number of
samples from small volume producers (< 5 l) were contaminated than
medium or large volume producers (Table 4). We also found that a
signiﬁcantly higher number of milk samples from commercial breed
cows were contaminated than that of the local breed cows. The reason
behind this diﬀerence could not be explained by the available in-
formation and thus a further study focusing on this issue is warranted.
Microbial contamination increases at the collector level due to long
holding time at ambient temperatures and pooling of milk from dif-
ferent producers in a single container. In addition, further contamina-
tion may be the outcome of poor hygienic conditions practiced by the
collectors during handling of bulk milk. At the chilling plant, con-
tamination of milk could potentially occur due to lack of temperature
control which favors exponential growth of previously introduced mi-
croorganisms. Other factors may be due to extended time of transpor-
tation of the milk to the chilling plants and possibly also due to the dirty
instruments employed for quality checks in chilling stations.

Finally, we believe that our observations clearly point at an unmet
need for good hygienic practices required to be urgently introduced at
each level of milk production in Bangladesh starting from producers to
the processors. More emphasis should be given at producer's level be-
cause microorganisms introduced to milk at this stage get the longest
time for survival and multiplication. Use of automated machines for
milking could be an alternative for achieving safe handling of milk at
producer level. Temperature controlled containers can be introduced at
collectors' level to restrict the growth of microorganisms present in
pooled milk. Transportation of milk from collectors to chilling stations
should be done by maintaining cold chain. Small scale pasteurization
plants can also be installed at collectors' levels so that processing of
milk can be done at the ﬁeld level. Further, the quality of this locally
produced pasteurized milk must be monitored carefully on a regular

basis. In addition, demand based marketing strategies need to be de-
veloped for proper distribution of processed milk to consumers.
