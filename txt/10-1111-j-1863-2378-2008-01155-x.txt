The current study aimed at determining the prevalence and the antimicrobial
resistance proﬁles of thermophilic Campylobacter spp. infecting broiler chick-
ens. A total of 240 caecal samples from six slaughterhouses were examined for
the presence of Campylobacter spp. C. jejuni was detected in 40.4% (97/240)
of the samples and C. coli in 12.1% (29/240). The agar disc diffusion method
and the E-test were used for testing the antimicrobial susceptibility of C. jejuni
and C. coli
isolates were most resistant to nalidixic acid
(79.4%) followed by tetracycline (76.3%), ciproﬂoxacin (74.2%) and enroﬂoxa-
cin (15.5%). Among the C. coli isolates, the frequency of resistance to nalidixic
acid and ciproﬂoxacin was the same at 65.5%. The predominant proﬁles of
multidrug resistance to three or more antimicrobials in C. jejuni and C. coli
were determined as tetracycline/nalidixic acid/ciproﬂoxacin resistance (48.5%)
and tetracycline/nalidixic acid/ciproﬂoxacin/enroﬂoxacin resistance (51.7%),
respectively. To prevent the transmission of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria of
animal origin to humans, it should be noted that high proportions of multi-
drug resistance were found in both species.

Introduction

these pathogens,

During the last
few decades, certain enteric bacteria,
responsible for the recent foodborne and waterborne epi-
demics in the world, have re-emerged as human patho-
gens. Of
thermophilic Campylobacter
spp.,
including Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter
coli, have been recognized as the primary causative agents
of bacterial human foodborne gastroenteritis
in both
industrialized and developing countries (World Health
Organization, 2002; Snelling et al., 2005). A signiﬁcant
association exists between Campylobacter
infection in

humans and consumption of contaminated poultry prod-
ucts, as revealed by case–control studies (Altekruse et al.,
1999; Stern et al., 2001; Friedman et al., 2004). Several
epidemiological studies have examined risk factors such
as the presence of other animals on the farm, contamina-
tion of previous ﬂock as well as vertical transmission for
the infection of broiler ﬂocks by Campylobacter (Gregory
et al., 1997; Newell and Fearnley, 2003). In addition,
Campylobacter bioﬁlms with/without other microorgan-
isms in the water lines of poultry houses could be a con-
tinuous source of
the contamination (Zimmer et al.,
2003).

among

resistance proﬁles

A number of studies observed the high level of anti-
microbial resistance in thermophilic Campylobacter spp.
in poultry and humans before the prohibition of the use
of antimicrobials as food additives to promote growth in
poultry (Smith et al., 1999; Owen and Leeton, 1999;
Engberg et al., 2001). Data regarding the prevalence and
antimicrobial
thermophilic
Campylobacter isolates of poultry origin in Turkey are
limited. Results obtained from previous studies cannot be
compared for prevalence rates and resistance proﬁles
because of differences in isolation procedures, sample
testing, as well as
material used and antimicrobial
geographic localization. However,
the development of
resistance to ﬂuoroquinolones among Campylobacter spp.
after the introduction of these drugs for the treatment of
infections in poultry has been reported and the level of
resistance rate was high in broiler chickens (Savasan et al.,
2004; Yildirim et al., 2005). We aimed at estimating
the prevalence of thermophilic Campylobacter spp. and
determining the current antimicrobial resistance proﬁles
of the isolates from broiler chickens.

Materials and Methods

Sample collection
A total of 240 caecal samples taken from broiler chickens
at six different slaughterhouses at Bandirma, Balikesir
during a 5-month period between March and July 2006
were studied. This study was conducted after a short
period of
the use of antimicrobial
agents as a feed additive in poultry industries in Turkey.
In each slaughterhouse, only one ﬂock was examined and
40 samples were randomly collected. All samples were put
into sterile tube, cooled in an icebox and immedi-
ately transported to the laboratory for bacteriological
culture.

Isolation and identiﬁcation

Thermophilic Campylobacter spp. were isolated from caecal
samples using a direct plating method. All samples were
homogenized and cultured on modiﬁed charcoal cefope-
razone deoxycholate agar (mCCDA) (Oxoid, Basingstoke,
UK) with selective supplement (SR155, Oxoid). All plates
were incubated under microaerophilic conditions for 48 h
at 42°C. Small, curved, catalase- and oxidase-positive,
Gram-negative bacilli were presumed to be Campylobacter
spp. Identiﬁcation to species level was subsequently based
on the ability of the isolate to hydrolyse sodium hippurate
and indoxyl acetate, H2S production in triple sugar iron
agar, and susceptibility to cephalothin (El-Shibiny et al.,
2005; On and Holmes, 1992). All isolates were transferred
to Brucella broth with 7% lysed horse blood and 10% glyc-

Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for tetracy-
cline, nalidixic acid, enroﬂoxacin and ciproﬂoxacin were
determined by using the E-test
(AB Biodisk, Solna,
Sweden) in accordance with the recommendations of the
manufacturer. Brieﬂy, the bacterial suspension equivalent
to 1.0 McFarland standard for each isolate was spread
(100 ll) on Petri plates containing Mueller-Hinton agar
with 5% deﬁbrinated sheep blood (Biomeriux, Marcy
I’ Etoile, France). E-test strips were applied on the agar
plates after the suspension were absorbed into the agar.
Plates were incubated under the same conditions as for
the disc diffusion method. The breakpoint values as rec-
ommended by the CLSI for veterinary pathogens used to
deﬁne resistance in the E-test were ‡16, ‡32, ‡4 and
‡4 lg/ml for tetracycline, nalidixic acid, enroﬂoxacin and
ciproﬂoxacin, respectively (Luber et al., 2003). During the
testing of the isolates in both methods, C. jejuni ATCC
33560, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus
ATCC 25923, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853
were included as the controls in each test batch.

Statistical analysis

The signiﬁcance of differences in resistance was analysed
by using the chi-squared test (spss software version 11.5;
SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A P-value of £0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant. To measure the corre-
lation and the level of aggrement between the agar disc
diffusion and E-test, the kappa statistics were calculated
with Stata version 9.0 software (Stata Corp., College Sta-
tion, TX, USA).

Results

Prevalence of thermophilic Campylobacter spp.
Of the 240 caecal samples processed, 126 (52.5%) were
found to be positive for thermophilic Campylobacter spp.
C. jejuni was found in 40.4% (97/240) of the samples and
C. coli in 12.1% (29/240). The distribution of Campylo-
bacter isolates from different slaughterhouses is shown in
Table 1.

Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of thermophilic
Campylobacter spp.

Ninety-seven C. jejuni and 29 C. coli isolates were exam-
ined for susceptibility to 11 antibiotics using the disc
diffusion method. The percentages of
isolates showing
susceptibility,
intermediate susceptibility, and resistance
to each antimicrobial agent are presented in Table 2. Of
the aminoglicosides included in the panel, sensitivity to
amikasin, kanamycin and streptomycin was seen in all
Campylobacter isolates. The sensitivity proﬁle to gentamy-
cin, the other aminoglicoside in this study, was deter-

while all of
isolates were sensitive to the
aminoglicoside. b-lactam resistance was not observed in
the isolates, but 44.3% of C. jejuni isolates and 51.7% of
C. coli isolates had an intermediate proﬁle. There was a
high resistance to tetracycline in C.
jejuni (76.3%) and
C. coli (55.2%) isolates. The highest level of ﬂuoroquino-
lone resistance of the C. jejuni isolates was recorded to
ciproﬂoxacin (74.2%), followed by 15.5% to enroﬂoxacin.
Among the C. coli isolates, no signiﬁcant difference was
observed between the rates of resistance to nalidixic acid
and ciproﬂoxacin. But the rates of resistance to enroﬂoxa-
cin were signiﬁcantly higher (v2 = 16.31; P < 0.05) for
C. coli (51.7%) than C. jejuni (15.5%). The predominant
proﬁles of multidrug resistance to three or more anti-
microbials in C. jejuni and C. coli were determined as tet-
racycline/nalidixic acid/ciproﬂoxacin resistance (48.5%)
and tetracycline/nalidixic acid/ciproﬂoxacin/enroﬂoxacin
resistance (51.7%), respectively.

The MIC ranges and the proportions of resistance of
C.
jejuni and C. coli isolates for the four antimicrobial
agents are summarized in Table 3. The MIC range for

jejuni

C.
isolate showed intermediate sensitivity in the
disc diffusion method but resistance in E-test. A wide
range of MICs among antimicrobials used in this study
was observed mainly in nalidixic acid for C. jejuni iso-
lates. Fifty-one and 25 C. jejuni isolates had MIC values
of 32 and 64 lg/ml, respectively. In terms of nalidixic
acid susceptibility pattern, two C. jejuni and one C. coli
isolates were determined as resistant
in E-test and as
intermediate in the disc diffusion method. There was a
great aggrement on the overall level of resistance, which
was determined by both the disc diffusion method and
E-test in C. jejuni and C. coli isolates (kappa = 0.93 and
0.98, respectively).

Discussion

In the present study, C. jejuni was isolated from 40.4%,
and C. coli from 12.1% of the caecal samples of broilers.
Species distribution among the positive slaughterhouses
showed that all ﬂocks were infected with both species.
The overall prevalence of
thermophilic Campylobacter
spp. [52.5% (126/240)] is generally concordant with the
results of similar studies carried out in other countries
(Jozwiak et al., 2006; Parisi et al., 2007). In Turkey, only
limited data exist on the prevalence of
thermophilic
Campylobacter spp.
in broilers and Campylobacter was
recovered at higher prevalences ranging from 91.3% to
95% (Yildiz and Diker, 1992; Yildirim et al., 2005).
Therefore, a downward trend was observed in the overall
prevalence of Campylobacter spp. although differences in
the sample type, sampling procedures, isolation methods
and season preclude
relative
prevalences as discussed previously (Newell and Fearnley,
2003). The use of antimicrobial agents as a feed additive
in poultry farms was prohibited by the Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Affairs, General Directorate of
Protection and Control in January 2006 in Turkey. This
study was conducted after a short period of the prohibi-
tion. The overall prevalence of thermophilic Campylobac-
ter spp. in the current study is lower than that reported
from previous studies in Turkey. This dramatic decrease
might be explained by the fact
the strategies of
hazard analysis and critical control point and/or other
hygiene programmes are strictly adapted to the poultry
industries in this region.

A national surveillance programme should be applied to
assess the resistance pattern of campylobacters in broiler
chickens as epidemiological surveillance of antimicrobial
resistance is a public health concern with relation to the
development of antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic bac-
teria of food animals. Data concerning antimicrobial resis-
tance in thermophilic Campylobacter spp. are limited in
Turkey. Yildirim et al. (2005) reported that the resistance

rates to tetracycline in C. jejuni and C. coli from broilers
were 42% and 58.1%, respectively. The level of resistance
to tetracycline (76.3%) among C.
jejuni isolates in this
study was higher than that of the earlier Turkish report,
while the level (55.2%) among C. coli isolates was in agree-
ment with the report. Several studies report the high levels
of tetracycline in campylobacters from food animals (Saenz
et al., 2000; Van Looveren et al., 2001; Bywater et al.,
2004), although a decrease to 1% in resistance level in tet-
racycline after the prohibition of the use of antibiotics as a
feed additive has been observed (Ro¨nner et al., 2004).

The ﬂuoroquinolones, ciproﬂoxacin and enroﬂoxacin,
were chosen for antimicrobial susceptibility tests in this
study because they are the ﬁrst- and/or second-line thera-
peutic agents and/or used for prophylaxis in poultry
industries in Turkey. Worldwide,
the development of
resistance to ﬂuoroquinolones among Campylobacter spp.
from food animals after the introduction of ﬂuoroquinol-
ones for the above purposes has previously been reported
(Saenz et al., 2000; Engberg et al., 2001; Savasan et al.,
2004). Especially, ciproﬂoxacin resistance frequencies in

have been reported in some European countries (Bywater
et al., 2004),
in Ireland (Corcoran et al., 2006), and
Canada (Guevremont et al., 2006). In the current study,
the level of ciproﬂoxacin resistance in C.
jejuni was
74.2%, similar to the level of 70.6% of the Turkish study
by Savasan et al. (2004). But a decrease in ciproﬂoxacine
resistance (65.5%) for C. coli was observed when com-
pared with the previous study, which reported the level of
ciproﬂoxacin resistance to be 78.1% in C. coli isolates in
broilers (Savasan et al., 2004). This study highlights that
the overall level of resistance to ciproﬂoxacin was high in
thermophilic Campylobacter spp. from broilers in Turkey.
It is well known that the irrational usage of antimicrobials
in animal production is linked to the development of
resistance in zoonotic bacteria and that the products of
animal origin can be a source of transmission of resistant
Campylobacter strains to humans (Owen and Leeton,
1999; Pearson et al., 2000). Fifty-nine per cent of human

quinolones (nalidixic acid) have been reported (Dionisi et
al., 2004; Griggs et al., 2005; Kinana et al., 2007).

When evaluating the resistance of campylobacters, a
high correlation between the agar disc diffusion method
and the E-test for tetracycline (kappa = 0.91 for C. jejuni
and kappa = 1.00 for C. coli) and quinolone/ﬂuoroquinol-
ones (kappa = 0.93 for C.

vious
of
Campylobacter spp. to different antimicrobials by both
tests (Ro¨nner et al., 2004; Miﬂin et al., 2007). Therefore,
this study also suggests that the disc diffusion method can
be used as a reliable alternative for susceptibility testing of
Campylobacter spp. to antimicrobial agents, particularly to
tetracycline and quinolone/ﬂuoroquinolones.

of this study is the absence of resistance to erythromycin
