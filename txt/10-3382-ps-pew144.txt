ABSTRACT
Salmonellosis is one of the major food-
borne diseases in many countries. This study was car-
ried out to determine the occurrence of Salmonella spp.,
Salmonella Enteritidis, and Salmonella Typhimurium
in raw chicken meat from wet markets and hyper-
markets in Selangor, as well as to determine the an-
tibiotic susceptibility profile of S. Enteritidis and S.
Typhimurium. The most probable number (MPN) in
combination with multiplex polymerase chain reaction
(mPCR) method was used to quantify the Salmonella
spp., S. Enteritidis, and S. Typhimurium in the sam-
ples. The occurrence of Salmonella spp., S. Enteri-

tidis, and S. Typhimurium in 120 chicken meat sam-
ples were 20.80%, 6.70%, and 2.50%, respectively with
estimated quantity varying from <3 to 15 MPN/g. The
antibiogram testing revealed differential multi-drug re-
sistance among S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium iso-
lates. All the isolates were resistance to erythromycin,
penicillin, and vancomycin whereas sensitivity was
recorded for Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid, Gentamicin,
Tetracycline, and Trimethoprim. Our findings demon-
strated that the retail chicken meat could be a source of
multiple antimicrobial-resistance Salmonella and may
constitute a public health concern in Malaysia.

INTRODUCTION

Salmonella is an important cause of food-borne dis-
ease in humans throughout the world and is a signif-
icant cause of morbidity, mortality, and economic loss
(Lin et al., 2014; Sallam et al., 2014). Among the more
than 2,500 Salmonella serotypes, Salmonella Enteritidis
and Salmonella Typhimurium are the most frequent
serovars associated with human illness (Rodpai et al.,
2013). Human S. Enteritidis cases are mostly associated
with the consumption of contaminated eggs and poul-
try meat, while S. Typhimurium cases with the con-
sumption of contaminated pork, poultry, and beef meat
(Spector and Kenyon, 2012; Park et al., 2014). Preva-
lence of S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium in meat
has been reported in many countries (de Freitas et al.,
2010; Shah and Korejo, 2012; Rodpai et al., 2013). In
Malaysia, while there have been numerous reports on
the prevalence of S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium in

food, very limited information has been published on S.
Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium in retail raw chicken
meat.

Rapid and accurate methods with shorter turnaround
time (1 to 2 days) for the detection of S. Enteri-
tidis and S. Typhimurium would significantly reduce
the resources required in routine laboratory operations.
Hence, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR)
is undoubtedly useful to be a specific and sensitive
method, which involves more than one pair of primers
allowing a simultaneous detection and identification of
different specific DNA sequences in a single-tube reac-
tion (Chen et al., 2012). Saeki et al. (2013 ) reported
that mPCR assay showed high specificity for the si-
multaneous detection and differentiation of Salmonella
spp., S. Enteritidis, and S. Typhimurium in chicken
meat. However, mPCR was limited to qualitative de-
termination of bacterial pathogens. To be able to quan-
tify the microorganism in a sample, the most probable
number (MPN) method has been used. Thus, mPCR
in association with the MPN method is usually used
for detection and enumeration of food-borne pathogens
(Chai et al., 2007; Kuan et al., 2013).

THUNG ET AL.

The occurrence of antimicrobial resistance among
zoonotic Salmonella is an increasing problem and
has become a serious health hazard worldwide (Singh
et al., 2013). Importantly, multi-drug resistant strains
involved in human salmonellosis have been identified in
commercial retail meats, and high levels of extended-
spectrum beta-lactamase producing Salmonella have
also been reported, particularly in poultry meat (EFSA
and ECDC, 2012). Lately, widespread overuse and
misuse of antibiotics in developing countries has con-
tributed an increasing trend of drug resistance level of
Salmonella (Ikwap et al., 2014). Geidam et al. (2012) re-
ported high prevalence of multi-drug resistant strains of
Salmonella was detected in the poultry environment in
Selangor (centre of Peninsular Malaysia) region. There-
fore, the objective of this study was to determine the
prevalence of Salmonella spp., S. Enteritidis, and S. Ty-
phimurium in raw chicken meat samples at retail mar-
kets in Selangor area of Malaysia using the MPN-mPCR
method. Additionally, the antibiotic susceptibility pro-
files of S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium were also
investigated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample Collection

From June to December 2014, a total of 120 samples
of raw chicken meat (wings = 40; breast = 40; drum-
sticks = 40) were purchased randomly from wet markets
and hypermarkets in Selangor, Malaysia. Wet markets
were open markets that sold both live and processed
chickens. Meanwhile, hypermarkets were enclosed mar-
kets that sold chickens chilled of frozen, supplied mostly
by large integrated poultry companies. The collected
samples were transported directly to the laboratory for
analysis by using an ice box.

Enrichment and MPN Method

Enrichment and MPN method was performed as de-
scribed by Pui et al. (2011). The sample (10 g) was ho-
mogenized with 90 mL of sterile buffered peptone water
(Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for 1 min using a Bag-
Mixer 400P stomacher machine (Interscience, Saint-
Nom-la-Bret`eche, France). The suspension was then di-
luted 10-fold serially to 1,000-fold. Three-tube MPN
method was carried out by transferring each dilution
(1 mL) into triplicate MPN tubes containing 10 mL
of Rappaport-Vasiliadis broth (Merck, Darmstadt, Ger-
many). All the tubes were incubated under aerobic con-
ditions at 37◦C for 24 h. After incubation, the turbidity
of the MPN tubes were examined prior to genomic DNA
extraction.

Genomic DNA Extraction

The genomic DNA of bacterial cultures from the
turbid MPN tubes was extracted by using boiled-cell
method (Chai et al., 2007). A 1 mL of each broth was
centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The resulting pel-
let was resuspended in 500 μL of sterile distilled water
and boiled for 10 min. Then, the mixture was cooled
at −20◦C for 10 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for
5 min. The supernatant containing DNA was used as
template for the multiplex PCR.

mPCR Ampliﬁcation

mPCR was conducted by using 3 sets of primers: i)
ST11 (5(cid:4)-GCCAA CCATT GCTAA ATTGG CGCA-
3(cid:4)) and ST15 (5(cid:4)-GGTAG AAATT CCCAG CGGGT
ACTGG-3(cid:4)) for detection of Salmonella spp. targeting
random sequence (429 bp) (Soumet et al., 1999); ii)
ENTF (5(cid:4)-TGTGT TTTAT CTGAT GCAAG AGG-
3(cid:4)) and ENTR (5(cid:4)-TGAAC TACGT TCGTT CTTCT
GG-3(cid:4)) for detection of S. Enteritidis targeting SdfI
gene (304 bp) (Alvarez et al., 2004); and iii) Fli15 (5(cid:4)-
CGGTG TTGCC CAGGT TGGTA AT-3(cid:4)) and Typ04
(5(cid:4)-ACTGG TAAAG ATGGC T-3(cid:4)) for detection of S.
Typhimurium targeting the fliC gene (620 bp) (Soumet
et al., 1999). Positive controls (S. Enteritidis ATCC
13076 and S. Typhimurium ATCC 14028) used in the
multiplex PCR assay were obtained from the Institute
for Medical Research, Malaysia. Amplification of DNA
was performed in 25 μL reaction mixtures containing 2
μL DNA template, 5 μL 5× PCR buffer, 0.5 μL 10 mM
deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 2.5 μL 25 mM MgCl2,
0.5 μL (0.2 μM for ST11 and ST15, 1.2 μM for Fli15,
Typ04, ENTF, and ENTR) primer and 14.2 μL ster-
ile distilled water. The mixture was then treated with
0.3 μL (1.5 U) Taq DNA polymerase. The PCR reac-
tions were carried out in a Veriti 96-Well Thermal Cy-
cler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with the fol-
lowing condition: initial denaturation at 94◦C for 2 min,
30 cycles of denaturation at 94◦C for 45 s, annealing
at 53◦C for 1 min, extension at 72◦C for 1 min, and
final extension at 72◦C for 7 min. A 3 μL aliquot of
the amplified PCR products were electrophoresed on
1.5% (wt/vol) agarose gel at 100 V for 40 min. Subse-
quently, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide and
visualized under UV light using the Gel Documentation
System (SynGene, Frederick, MD). A DNA fragment of
100-bp (Vivantis Technologies, Selangor, Malaysia) was
included in each gel as molecular weight marker.

Serotyping

Presumptive S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium iso-
lates were further confirmed by slide agglutination test
using polyvalent ‘O’ and ‘H’ antisera (BD, Franklin
Lakes, NJ). The isolates were serotyped at Veterinary
Research Institute, Ipoh, Malaysia according to the

intermediate, or resistant) was determined. Escherichia
coli (ATCC 25922) was used as a control. The multiple
antibiotic resistance (MAR) index was calculated by
using the formula: a/b, where ‘a’ represents the num-
ber of antibiotics to which a particular isolate was re-
sistant and ‘b’ the total number of antibiotics tested
(Krumperman, 1983).

Statistical Analysis

All measurements were carried out in triplicate.
Minitab (v. 14) statistical package (Minitab Inc., State
College, PA) was used. For all analysis, P value < 0.05
was considered significant.

RESULTS

The target genes specific to Salmonella spp., S. En-
teritidis and S. Typhimurium produced PCR products
429 bp, 304 bp, and 620 bp in size, respectively. The
PCR products were obtained clearly distinguished by
agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 1).

The prevalence ofSalmonella spp., S. Enteritidis, and
S. Typhimurium in chicken meat from wet markets and
hypermarkets are summarized in Table 1. Out of 120
samples examined, the prevalence of Salmonella spp.,
S. Enteritidis, and S. Typhimurium were 20.80% (n =
25), 6.70% (n = 8), and 2.50% (n = 3), respectively.
The contamination rates of Salmonella spp. was found
to be the most predominant in wet markets (26.70%)
compared with hypermarkets (15.00%) (P < 0.05). In
addition, the prevalence of S. Enteritidis from wet mar-
kets (10.00%) was slightly higher than those from hy-
permarkets (3.33%) (P < 0.05). Low detection of S. Ty-
phimurium was observed using MPN-mPCR method,
indicating no significant difference between wet mar-
kets and hypermarkets.

In this study, chicken breast was the important reser-
voir for Salmonella, with prevalence rate of 47.50% (n =
40) (Table 1). From the MPN-PCR method, the high-
est concentration of Salmonella spp., S. Enteritidis, and
S. Typhimurium were 15.0 MPN/g, 3.6 MPN/g, and
3.6 MPN/g, respectively (Table 2).

Antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out for
S. Enteritidis (n = 8), and S. Typhimurium (n = 3).

ual, 2008).

Antibiotic Susceptibility Test

Antibiotic susceptibility of the putative isolates was
tested by using disc diffusion method described in the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI,
2008). The microorganisms were cultured aerobically in
10 mL Tryptic Soy Broth (Merk, Darmstadt, Germany)
at 37◦C for 24 h. The cultures were swabbed with ster-
ile non-toxic cotton swab on Mueller-Hinton agar plates
(Merk, Darmstadt, Germany) and left to dry for 2 to
4 min. The antimicrobial sensitivity discs (Oxoid, Ham-
phire, United Kingdom) were then placed on the culture
by using a Disk Diffusion Dispenser (Oxoid). Antibi-
otic discs tested were Amoxycillin (30 μg), Ampicillin
(10 μg), Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid (30 μg), Cepha-
zolin (30 μg), Ceftazidime (30 μg), Ciprofloxacin (5 μg),
Erythromycin (15 μg), Gentamicin (10 μg), Kanamycin
(30 μg), Penicillin (10 μg), Nalidixic acid (30 μg),
Streptomycin (10 μg), Tetracycline (30 μg), Trimetho-
prim (5 μg), and Vancomycin (30 μg). After incuba-
tion at 37◦C for 24 h, the size of the inhibition zone
was measured and the level of susceptibility (sensitive,

All the isolates were resistance to erythromycin, peni-
cillin, and vancomycin (Table 3). However, low level of
resistance was observed to nalidixic acid (9.09%) and
streptomycin (9.09%). As can be seen in the profile
(Table 3), four antibiotics amoxicillin/clavulanic acid,
gentamicin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim were found
to be 100% effective, whereas low level of sensitivity
was showed by cephazolin (54.55%). Based on the re-
sistance pattern, S. Typhimurium isolates exhibited the
highest MAR index value of 0.40 (Table 4). Meanwhile,
MAR index of S. Enteritidis isolates were observed at
0.27 and 0.33. Multi-drug resistant (MDR) S. Enteri-

tidis and S. Typhimurium isolates displayed resistance
to at least three antibiotics (erythromycin, penicillin,
and vancomycin) were most often observed (Table 4).

DISCUSSION

The prevalence of Salmonella spp.

in this study
was found to be similar to the results reported by
Ng et al. (2013), where the contamination rates of
Salmonella spp. from wet markets (43.00%) was higher
than those from hypermarkets (32.00%). In comparison
between the two types of shops, the levels of Salmonella

incidence from hypermarkets was lower than that from
wet markets. This may suggest that hypermarkets had
food handlers of better personal hygiene and better san-
itary condition in the food processing environment as
compared to wet markets. Oscar (2004) suggested that
lower Salmonella prevalence from hypermarkets could
be due to the storage temperature, which identified
as an important risk factor of pathogen survival and
growth. According to Kuan et al. (2013), the difference
in holding time has a remarked effect on variation in
prevalence from wet markets and hypermarkets.

Slaughtered poultry are well known reservoirs of
Salmonella. Thus, our finding is consistent with that
of Lin et al. (2014) who showed that Salmonella preva-
lence of 25.66% (n = 113) on retail chicken meat. It
also proposed that cross-contamination during process-
ing and cutting or workers during retailing and mar-
keting could be attributed to the high prevalence of
Salmonella in chicken meat. High levels of Salmonella
prevalence on retail chickens have been reported in
Thailand (57.00%, n = 72) (Padungtod and Kaneene,
2006), China (53.59%, n = 515) (Yang et al., 2010),
and Vietnam (42.91%, n = 268) (Thai et al., 2012). In
contrast, low Salmonella prevalence rates were found
in Morocco (0.42%, n = 1,200) (Bouchrif et al., 2009).
This observation suggested that several factors such as
differences in country and origin, type of meat sam-
ples, sampling seasons, slaughterhouse sanitation, and
isolation method may also influenced the differences in
prevalence.

The MPN-mPCR method used to quantify the micro-
bial load can facilitate the enumeration of Salmonella
spp., S. Enteritidis, and S. Typhimurium in retail
chicken meat samples in a short time. Low counts of
these food-borne pathogens in this study are less likely
to cause salmonellosis. However, it is important to note
that chicken meat products, by their nature, undergo
extensive processing and handling during their produc-
tion can increase the risk of contamination. Accord-
ing to Yang et al. (2010), Salmonella contamination
was common in retail meats (chicken, beef, lamb, and
pork), which could be a potential vehicle for transmit-
ting Salmonella to humans. Hence, implementation and
maintenance of some control measures such as hazard
analysis and critical control point and good manufac-
turing practices, as well as further strengthen the edu-
cation of food processors will be necessary, in order to
reduce the risk of salmonellosis.

High resistance of S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium
to erythromycin, penicillin, and vancomycin in our
study suggest that these antibiotics are widely used in
this region. Resistance to erythromycin and penicillin
has been reported as the most common resistance pro-
file in retail meat products (Sallam et al., 2014). In
another case, Singh et al. (2013) have found that resis-
tance to penicillin and vancomycin was 100% in poul-
try and poultry environments. This could be due to
improper usage or overuse of a particular antimicrobial
causing resistance to occur. In contrast, the resistance

to nalidixic acid and streptomycin were found to be
lower. Similarly, low levels of resistances to nalidixic
acid (13.36%) and streptomycin (10.62%) were also
observed, particularly among isolates (S. Enteritidis
and S. Typhimurium) recovered from retail chicken
meats (Yang et al., 2010). In this study, there were
no S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium isolates resistant
to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, gentamicin, tetracycline,
and trimethoprim. Previously, Dong et al. (2014) re-
ported that all the Salmonella isolates (n = 83) dis-
played 100% sensitive to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid,
whilst 98.80% to gentamicin and 92.77% to tetracycline.
On the other hand, our findings demonstrate that
MDR strains of S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium are
prevalent in both retail markets. This might lead to hu-
man infections with food-borne antimicrobial resistant
pathogen, and probably create an enormous challenge
to treatment of Salmonella infection in humans and an-
imals in Malaysia.

Various reports on the risk factor associated with the
occurrence of MDR Salmonella isolates have been pub-
lished. Fashae et al. (2010) reported that the appear-
ance of MDR Salmonella isolates correlates positively
with the indiscriminate use of antibiotics at recom-
mended doses or at sub-therapeutic doses as feed addi-
tives in poultry farm. In addition, genetic and biochem-
ical mechanisms may have significantly contributed to
the emergence of MDR strains of Salmonella, and thus
preserve their drug resistance genes and enhance their
survivability. On the contrary, Giraud et al. (2006 ) had
reported that modifications of topoisomerase targets,
increased efflux activity, and topoisomerase protection
by the plasmid-encoded protein might be used to com-
bat resistance. Therefore, the finding of this study in-
dicated that retail raw chicken meat acts as a reservoir
for harboring multi-drug resistance Salmonella, which
can be a problem and a major food safety concern for
public health. Thus, it is necessary for developing effec-
tive intervention strategies, as well as employing natural
biocontrol agents such as bacteriophages to ensure the
safety of our food supplies.
