Aims: Thirty Campylobacter jejuni strains isolated from fecal samples (n = 94;
32%) from 13 positive farms (n = 17; 76%) from commercial broiler chickens
in Puerto Rico were analysed by molecular methods.
Methods and Results: Isolates were identiﬁed with multiplex polymerase chain
reaction assays, tested for their antimicrobial susceptibility and characterized
with pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis
sequence typing
(MLST), serotyping and bacterial cytotoxicity in mammalian cells. Isolates
exhibited high resistance to vancomycin (minimum inhibitory concentration,
)1); few were

resistant to clindamycin (MIC90 4 lg ml
)1); but none was resistant to azithromycin
and tetracycline (MIC90 8 lg ml
)1) or gentamycin (MIC90
(MIC90 4 lg ml
)1). Most strains restricted with SmaI, but a combination of SmaI–KpnI
4 lg ml
digestion was more discriminatory. MLST analysis yielded four sequence types
(ST), and ST-2624 was the predominant one. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a
high degree of recombination for glnA and pgm genes. The predominant sero-
types were O:3 and O:5. Most strains had lowest cytotoxicity potential with
Caco-2 cells, medium cytotoxicity with INT-407 and Hep-2 cells and high
cytotoxicity with CHO cells.
Conclusion: A low degree of antimicrobial resistance, 13 PFGE proﬁles, 4 ST
and a large variability in cytotoxicity assays were found for these strains.
Signiﬁcance and Impact of the Study: This is the ﬁrst characterization of C. je-
juni strains isolated from broilers in Puerto Rico. The genetic diversity of these
strains suggests that several techniques are needed for strain characterization.

Introduction

Little information is available about human campylobact-
eriosis in Puerto Rico. After Salmonella, Campylobacter
jejuni has been reported as the second most common
foodborne bacterial pathogen isolated from humans, with

an incidence of 3Æ5%, from a reference laboratory in San
Juan (Lopez-Ortiz and Solivan 1999). However, there is
no information on the incidence and characteristics of
Campylobacter spp. in commercial broilers raised in the
island. The poultry industry is the second largest agricul-
tural industry in Puerto Rico, with broiler meat comprising

jejuni, epidemic clones responsible for human
disease are characterized by unique combinations of vir-
ulence genes or their alleles (Maynard Smith et al. 1993;
Musser 1996), and some clones have been associated
with domestic animals raised for human consumption,
primarily broiler chickens. Therefore, it is assumed that
contaminated raw poultry products
and consuming
undercooked poultry are major risk factors for human
campylobacteriosis (Butzler and Oosterom 1991; Tauxe
1997; Nadeau et al. 2002). However, drawing conclusions
about
jejuni strains
from different sources has always been a challenge. The

limitations
when accurate estimations are needed for source track-
ing efforts aimed at determining the attribution of infec-
tions to food sources. Besides the differences in the
interpretation of the results from the same techniques
applied to different C. jejuni isolates, different molecular
approaches may answer speciﬁc questions but may not
be complementary to each other to help identifying
sources and improve the prediction of the appearance of
epidemic clones in foods. Few studies have addressed
the complementation of methods
for epidemiological
studies. The use of genomotyping may represent a holis-
tic approach to identifying potentially pathogenic clones.
Yet, these methods still do not provide a complete over-
view on the variability in the genomic proﬁles among
jejuni strains from different areas (Ka¨renlampi et al.
C.
2007). In addition, sequencing methods such as multilo-
cus sequence typing (MLST) are more expensive than
molecular typing methods based on restriction proﬁles,
such as pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE). With
this in view, we collected samples from commercial live
broilers in Puerto Rico to isolate Campylobacter strains
and analyse them with molecular techniques to under-
stand their genomic composition and determine the
virulence potential. We collected Campylobacter strains
from faecal material
taken from commercial broiler
chickens. These strains were analysed using different
molecular techniques to determine possible traits that
would predict their risk for humans. For this purpose,
the isolates were: (i) identiﬁed to the species level using
culture media and multiplex polymerase chain reaction
(mPCR) assays; (ii) tested for their antimicrobial suscep-
tibility, and analysed using PFGE, MLST and serotyping.
In addition, their cytotoxicity potential
in mammalian
cell lines was investigated.

Materials and methods

Sample collection

Ninety-four faecal samples from 17 farms (34 houses or
ﬂocks; two houses per farm) were tested for the presence
of Campylobacter spp. The isolates were identiﬁed to the
species level using two mPCR assays developed for the
identiﬁcation of C. jejuni and Campylobacter coli. Isolates
were also tested with a hippurate test (Remel, Lenexa, KS,
USA).

The faecal samples were collected from 17 commercial
broiler farms in Puerto Rico between March and May
2005 covering different areas in the center–south region
of the island. Sampled farms contained chicken houses,
some with double-deck houses, with ﬁve to seven samples
collected from each farm. Each sample consisted of c. 2–
3 g of
freshly deposited faecal material collected from
three to four different areas of the houses with sterile ton-
gue depressors. The samples were placed in tubes contain-
ing Cary–Blair semi-solid medium supplemented with 5%
lysed horse blood and shipped in refrigeration (c. 8–
10°C) for analysis to the Department of Poultry Science,
Auburn University, USA.

Campylobacter isolation

The faecal samples were analysed for Campylobacter spp.
by direct plating on modiﬁed Campy–Cefex (mCC;
Oyarzabal et al. 2005) and on modiﬁed charcoal cefope-
razone deoxycholate agar
(mCCDA; Hutchinson and
Bolton 1984) within 4–6 days of collection. All samples
were also enriched in Preston broth (Oxoid Inc., New
York) (42°C for 24 h) under microaerobic conditions
(10% CO2, 5% O2 and 85% N2; Airgas, Radnor, PA, USA)
generated using jars gassed with a MACSmics Jar Gassing
System (Microbiology International, Frederick, MD, USA).
Enriched samples were swabbed (c. 0Æ1 ml) onto mCC and
mCCDA plates. All plates were then incubated under
microaerobic conditions (42°C for 48 h) and screened
for typical Campylobacter colonies. The colonies were
considered presumptive positive if they showed the typical
morphology and motility under phase-contrast micros-
copy (Optiphot-2; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). All presumptive
isolates were collected and individually stored at )80°C
in tryptic soy broth (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) supple-
mented with 30% glycerol (v ⁄ v) and 5% lysed horse
blood for further identiﬁcation and characterization.

to prepare fresh bacterial DNA. DNA was extracted using
PrepManÔ Ultra (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA). The DNA samples were tested with two mPCR
assays developed for the identiﬁcation of C.
jejuni and
C. coli. These PCR assays were performed in 25-ll aliquots
as described elsewhere (Oyarzabal et al. 2005, 2007a). A
PTC-100 Programmable Thermal Controller
(Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) was used for ampliﬁca-
tion. Amplicons were detected in 1Æ5% UltraPureÔ
Agarose-1000 (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) and DNA bands were stained with ethidium bro-
mide, visualized using a ultraviolet (UV) transilluminator
(Gel-Doc System; Syngene, Frederick, MD, USA) followed
by recording using a computer program (GeneSnap) for
molecular analysis (Syngene). All strains were also tested
with a commercial hippurate test (Hardy Diagnostics,
Santa Maria, CA, USA).

Epsilon test (EtestÒ)

Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed with
Etest antibiotic strips (AB Biodisk North America, Inc.,
Piscataway, NJ, USA) as suggested by the manufacturer.
Mueller–Hinton agar plates were prepared using S-8000
plate maker and poured using a APS 320 automated petri
dish ﬁller (Microbiology International, Frederick, MD,
USA). A higher than the recommended inocula, corre-
sponding to c. 1Æ0 at OD600 nm, was used to seed the Mu-
eller–Hinton agar plates. The isolates were tested for their
sensitivity to azithromycin, ciproﬂoxacin, clindamycin,
erythromycin, gentamycin, tetracycline, trimethoprim and
vancomycin.

Sequencing of the tet(O) gene and plasmid analysis

The ampliﬁcation of a 559-bp fragment of the tet(O) gene
was done using primers DMT 1 and DMT 2 (Gibreel
et al. 2004). A premade mix (OmniMixÒ HS; Cepheid,
Sunnyvale, CA, USA) was used for the PCR reactions and
the ampliﬁcation conditions were 95°C for 4 min, 30
cycles of 95°C for 1 min (denaturation), 61°C for 1 min
(hybridization) and 72°C for 1 min (extension), and a
ﬁnal extension of 72°C for 4 min. A 2015-bp segment of
the tet(O) gene was ampliﬁed using primers tet(O)-F
109–1108 (5¢-TTG TTT TGG GGC TAT TGG AG-3¢),
tet(O)-R 109–1108 (5¢-TCA CCG TTT GTC GGA ACA
TA-3¢), tet(O)-F 750–1500 (5¢-GAG AAA TAT ATG TCA
GGG AAA CCG T-3¢), tet(O)-R 750–1500 (5¢-CGG TCT
TTC CAT ATA TAT AAC AGT AGG C-3¢), tet(O)-F
1089–2193 (5¢-TAT GTT CCG ACA AAC GGT GA-3¢)
and tet(O)-R 1089–2193 (5¢-CCC AAT TCC CAT TCA
TCA TAA-3¢). The ampliﬁed products were sequenced
using an ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).

The sequence of the 1997-bp segment of the tet(O) gene
from one strain was submitted to the European Bioinfor-
matics Institute (EBI) and was assigned the accession
numbers (AM884250). The strains were tested for the
presence of plasmids using unrestricted agarose plugs in
PFGE gels and with the QIAprepÒ Spin Mini Prep kit
and QIAﬁlterÔ Plasmid Midi kit (Qiagen Inc., Sunyvale,
CA, USA) for plasmid extraction. Positive Escherichia coli
strains (AU4 AU19) containing known plasmids were
used as positive controls in gel electrophoresis.

PFGE analysis

Thirty isolates were tested with a standard PFGE protocol
(Ribot et al. 2001) with the modiﬁcations suggested by
the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (http://
www.cdc.gov/pulsenet ⁄ protocols.htm) was used. A diges-
tion of Salmonella choleraesuis ssp. choleraesuis serotype
Braenderup H9812 (ATCC BAA-664) was used as the
DNA size marker. This marker was included in three
lanes per each PFGE gel, the two lanes at the end and
one in the middle. Campylobacter DNA was digested with
KpnI, SalI or SmaI, as well as a combination of
SmaI ⁄ KpnI. The strains that were not digestible with
SmaI were also tested with the following enzymes: ApaI,
BamHI, BglII, HindIII, KspI (SacII), NotI, NruI, SacI, SpeI
and XbaI. The switch times for the SmaI ⁄ KpnI combina-
tion were initial 6Æ76 s and ﬁnal 35Æ38 s. Restricted DNA
fragments were separated with a contour-clamped homo-
geneous electric ﬁeld (CHEF Mapper; Bio-Rad) in 1%
agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide, visualized
with a UV transilluminator (Gel-Doc System; Bio-Rad),
and a picture recorded using GeneSnap (Syngene). PFGE
proﬁles were used to perform a pair comparison and
cluster analysis using the Dice correlation coefﬁcient, and
a dendogram was created by the Unweighted Pair Group
method using Mathematical Average (UPGMA) clustering
algorithm of BioNumerics version 4.50 (Applied Maths,
Austin, TX, USA). The optimization and position toler-
ance for band analysis were set at 1%, and a cutoff of
90% was used to analyse the different PFGE patterns
(De Boer et al. 2000).

MLST and sequence analysis and phylogenetic
calculations

MLST was performed following the guidelines available at
the C. jejuni MLST website (http://pubmlst.org/campylo-
bacter ⁄ ) and guidelines from previous publications (Din-
gle et al. 2001). The PCR ampliﬁcation was performed in
25-ll reactions using a premade mix (Invitrogen Corpo-
ration). Amplicons were detected on 1Æ5% ethidium
bromide agarose gels and puriﬁed with a MiniElute PCR

(Qiagen Inc.). The concentration of
ampliﬁed DNA was measured with a NanoDropÒ
ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies,
Wilmington, DE). Two premade PCR mixes, OmniMixÒ
HS (Cephied, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and Platinum PCR
Supermix (Invitrogen Corporation) were used for PCR
ampliﬁcation for sequencing using the suggested internal
primers. The ampliﬁed products were sequenced at the
Auburn University Genetic Analysis Laboratory. The
sequences were then aligned, assembled and edited using
MultAlin (http://prodes.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin/multalin.

trees
speciﬁc genes based on their
sequences were conducted using Neighbour-Joining analy-
sis of MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis)
version 4 (http://www.megasoftware.net). Split decompo-
sition analysis to test for recombination was done using
SplitsTree analysis (Bandelt and Dress 1992; Huson
1998) with free software (http://pubmlst.org/perl/mlstana-

Serotyping

Serotyping was done by passive haemagglutination of the
soluble thermostable antigens of C.
jejuni (Penner and
Hennessey 1980). Antigenic extracts of Campylobacter
strains were prepared by boiling and centrifugation (Las-
tovica et al. 1986). Type-speciﬁc antisera were titrated by
a passive haemagglutination test against antigen-sensitized
sheep erythrocytes, as described by Penner and Hennessey
(1980). Sensitized sheep erythrocytes were tested by pas-
sive haemagglutination against 60 reference antisera and
those found to be non-ypable were retested against seven
other provisional antisera prepared against infrequently
occurring serotypes. The serotype of the isolate was desig-
nated according to the antisera in which agglutination
was observed.

Cell culture and cytotoxicity assays

Twenty C. jejuni strains, representing all 12 PFGE proﬁles
obtained with the combination SmaI ⁄ KpnI, were analysed
for their cytotoxicity potential on human colon (Caco-2,
HTB-7), human larynx epithelial
(Hep-2, CCL-23),
Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO, CCL-61) and human

intestine epithelial (INT-407) cells. Cytotoxicity assays
were performed by measuring the supernatant
lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH), a stable cytosolic enzyme that is
released upon cell lysis (Hu et al. 2006). Cell lines were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and
maintained in 25-cm2 ﬂasks with Dulbecco’s modiﬁed
Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO,
USA) containing 10% foetal bovine serum (Atlanta Bio-
logicals, Norcross, GA, USA). The virulence potential of
C. jejuni strains was determined using an in vitro cytotox-
icity assay (Maldonado et al. 2005). Brieﬂy, conﬂuent
host cell monolayers were trypsinized and grown in 24-
well plates (37°C; 7% CO2 and humidity for up to 72 h).
Campylobacter jejuni was added at a multiplicity of infec-
tion (MOI) of 100. After 6 h of incubation at 37°C in the
presence of 7% CO2, tissue culture cell supernatants were
centrifuged (300 g, 5 min), and the release of endogenous
LDH from the cytosol of damaged, mammalian cells was
measured by dispensing a 0Æ1-ml aliquot of cell superna-
tant combined with 0Æ1 ml of LDH substrate into each
well of a 96-well microtitre plate. Per cent cytotoxicity
values were determined based on the amount of LDH
released from 9-min readings for both the positive and
negative controls in each experiment, as follows:
percent cytotoxicity ¼ðAexp APBSÞ=ðATriton X APBSÞ 100

where Aexp is the absorbance of the sample, APBS is the
absorbance of phosphate-buffered saline and ATriton-X is
the absorbance of Triton X-100 at 1% concentration. At
least three experiments were run for each strain and each
cell line. In addition, per cent cytotoxicity values among
different cell lines were analysed using the GLM (General
Linear Model) procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Incorpo-
rated, Cary, NC, USA), and means were analysed for dif-
ferences with the Duncan’s multiple range test, with
signiﬁcance set at P £ 0Æ05.

plugs did not reveal any migrating band that could be
interpreted as being of plasmid origin which was further
conﬁrmed by direct plasmid preparation. From the 22
isolates that showed a tetracycline MIC value between 1

PFGE results

jejuni

Thirty C.
isolates were analysed by PFGE. The
restriction proﬁles obtained varied among the enzymes
tested. SmaI restriction resulted in nine proﬁles, KpnI
restriction resulted in eight PFGE proﬁles, SalI restriction
gave seven proﬁles and the combination of SmaI–KpnI
digestion yielded 13 different restriction proﬁles, with a
number of DNA bands that varied from 6 to 14. Ten
strains did not restrict with KpnI, while two strains did
not restrict with SalI, SmaI or SmaI ⁄ KpnI. Besides the
suggested pulse time for KpnI (Anon. 2007), we also tried
other switch times, some described elsewhere (De Boer
et al. 2000; Michaud et al. 2001), but the bands in the

PFGE gels were usually less deﬁned for KpnI and SalI
than for SmaI. To prove whether the lack of SmaI restric-
tion was because of presence of endogenous proteinases,
formaldehyde-treated plugs were digested with different
restriction enzymes. The two strains did not restrict with
ApaI, BglII, HindIII, KspI (SacII), KpnI, NotI, SmaI, SpeI
or XbaI, but were restricted with BamHI, NruI, SalI and
SacI, suggesting that the lack of bands in the SmaI digest
is most probably the result of the lack of SmaI restrictions
sites.

The incorporation of thiourea during the running of
the PFGE gels was reported to improve the discrimination
of DNA bands (Corkill et al. 2000), although the addition
)1 of thiourea did not improve
of more than 200 lmol l
resolution (data not shown).

MLST results
The use of both OmniMixÒ HS and Platinum PCR
Supermix for PCR ampliﬁcation gave clean amplicons
for
for MLST analysis. Table 2
shows the allelic proﬁles and clonal complexes from the
C.
jejuni strains. No new allelic sequences were found
for any of the house-keeping genes. However, the pre-
dominant
allelic proﬁle was new and assigned as
sequence type (ST)-2624, and deposited on the MLST
web
(http://pubmlst.org/campylobacter/). Among
individual alleles, glnA and pgm were the genes with
considerable variability in allelic proﬁles, with four
alleles for pgm (10, 11, 86 and 89) and for glnA (4, 17,
21 and 30). A calculation of phylogenetic trees for pgm
and glnA based on their sequences and using the Neigh-
bour-Joining feature analysis of MEGA version 4 (Tam-
ura et al. 2007) showed a high variability within the
four alleles of each gene (data not shown). The calcula-

tkt = 0Æ4710 and uncA = 0Æ4258. Overall,

from DnaSP version 4.10.9 resulted in values of 0Æ77
(Kelly 1997) and 0Æ74 (Rozas et al. 2001) for pgm and
0Æ42 (Kelly 1997) and 0Æ53 (Rozas et al. 2001) for glnA.
Three alleles were found for aspA (7, 14 and 24) and tkt
(1, 3 and 59), and only two for gltA (2 and 5), glyA (2
and 68) and uncA (5 and 6). Their calculated genetic
diversities at individual loci (LIAN) were: aspA = 0Æ5398;
glnA = 0Æ6172;
pgm =

the
LIAN analysis resulted in a mean genetic diversity (H)
of 0Æ5266 ± 0Æ027 (SD), and showed linkage disequilib-
rium for this population of C. jejuni (Table 3). The phy-
logenetic tree of the ST proﬁles was calculated with the
UPGMA and showed that the new proﬁle ST-2624 was
more closely related to ST-460 than the other two ST
proﬁles. The decomposition analysis was performed with
SplitsTree and resulted in a network-like shape suggest-
ing a high degree of
recombination within genes
(Fig. 1). When compared with PFGE, MLST was less
discriminating for
strain characterization, and strains
that grouped under ST-2624 had seven different PFGE
proﬁles (Fig. 2).

Serotyping results

From the 30 C. jejuni isolates analysed with the serotyp-
ing scheme, the predominant serotypes were O:3 and O:5.
Two strains had a weak reaction with O:21 and 18 strains
from the O:3 and O:5 serotypes had a minor component
which serotyped as O:21. Ten strains were nontypable by
the panel of antisera used.

Cell cultures and cytotoxicity assays

Twenty C. jejuni strains representing all 12 PFGE proﬁles
obtained by the combination of SmaI ⁄ KpnI were charac-
terized for their cytotoxicity potential (measured as LDH
release) on selected tissue cell lines (Caco-2, CHO, Hep-2
and INT-407). Each strain was compared with a positive
control (Triton X-100), a low control (PBS) and C. jejuni
ATCC 29428. Cell cytotoxicity was grouped based on the
amount of LDH released from each cell line, with catego-
ries divided as low (1–20%), medium (21–49%) and high
(>50%). Table 4 shows the results grouped in categories
for all the cell lines. Only one strain was grouped into the
low category for each cell line. When tested with Caco-2
cells, most strains grouped as medium, while most strains
grouped as high when tested with CHO cells. Testing
with INT-407 and Hep-2 resulted in a similar distribution

Discussion

We pursued this study to determine the prevalent Cam-
pylobacter species that colonizes commercial broiler ﬂocks
in Puerto Rico and to characterize these isolates using
PFGE, MLST, antimicrobial susceptibility, heat-stable se-
rotyping and the invasiveness in mammalian cell cultures.
The year average temperature in Puerto Rico is between
70° and 90°F, and the temperature recorded outside the
farms was between 75° and 80°F. Only few samples were
positive by direct plating, but 32% of the samples were
positive after enrichment in Preston broth. This number
of positive ﬂocks is similar to the 57% reported for com-
mercial broilers in the southeast United States (Stern
et al. 2001; Potturi-Venkata et al. 2007a). Therefore, the
shipping of the samples under refrigeration for several
days may have accounted for a reduction in the number
of campylobacters in the sample, but did not result in a
detectable reduction in the prevalence of positive ﬂocks
(56%) or farms (76%). The ﬂocks were sampled two
weeks before processing, when Campylobacter is usually
present in high numbers (Potturi-Venkata et al. 2007a;
b). The methodology used was optimized with combina-
tions of plates and enrichment broth for the isolation of

policies limiting the use of antimicrobials in food animals
(Gallay et al. 2007).

The general incidence of resistance among the antimi-
crobials tested with the disc diffusion method was low.
Multiresistance was not found among these isolates and
may be related to the low usage of antimicrobials for
disease treatment in animal production in Puerto Rico.
The disc diffusion method appears to be reliable for the
determination of MIC for erythromycin, ciproﬂoxacin
and tetracycline for C. jejuni and C. coli (Gaudreau and
Gilbert 1997). Although gentamicin and erythromycin
resistance is usually low in C. jejuni, erythromycin resis-
tance in C. jejuni from chicken appears to be increasing
in Canada (Le´vesque et al. 2007). Erythromycin is still an
important antimicrobial for treatment of campylobacteri-
osis in humans. The increase in the inoculum used to
seed the plates for the disc diffusion method resulted in
more consistent and reliable results recorded at 24 h of
incubation, and similar suggestions on the preparation of
the inocula and MIC interpretation have been reported to
improve the per cent agreement between the disc diffu-
sion method and the agar dilution method for erythro-
mycin (Luangtongkum et al. 2007).

None of the isolates exhibited resistance to ciproﬂoxa-
cin. Our results differed from the antimicrobial resistance
reported for C.
in Trinidad and Tobago, where
jejuni
87% of the C.
jejuni broiler strains were found to be
resistant to sulfa ⁄ trimethoprim and ciproﬂoxacin, three
antimicrobials that are apparently used routinely by the
poultry industry in that country (Rodrigo et al. 2007). In
France, the resistance to ciproﬂoxacin by C. jejuni from
broilers decreased from 31% in 2002 to 9% in 2004, a
decrease that has been suggested to be the beneﬁts of

jejuni

The incidence of tetracycline resistance was lower than
the incidence recorded for organic or conventionally
grown poultry in the United States (Luangtongkum et al.
2006), or in Canada, where more than 60% of
the
C.
isolates from chickens are resistant to tetra-
cycline and 8–40% are resistant to ciproﬂoxacin (Anon
2005b; Kos et al. 2006). The sequencing of c. 90% of the
chromosomally encoded gene that confers tetracycline
resistance conﬁrmed that this gene is highly conserved
in C. jejuni strains isolated from humans and domestic
animals (Gibreel et al. 2004).

Studies that compared the restriction patterns of SmaI
and KpnI of human isolates of C. jejuni have concluded
that KpnI is the enzyme of choice for molecular epidemi-
jejuni (Michaud et al. 2001; Ka¨ren-
ology studies of C.
lampi et al. 2003). However, we found that the use of
SmaI appears to be better than KpnI for PFGE analysis of
C.
jejuni from live broilers. SmaI always restricts more
C. jejuni strains than KpnI (Michaud et al. 2001), and it
is the primary restriction enzyme for the protocols devel-
oped by the CDC, CampyNet (http://campynet.vetinst.dk/
PFGE.html) and studies in Denmark (Nielsen et al. 2006).
SalI normally generates partial digest despite the experi-
mental conditions (Ho and Monaco 1995), a feature that
we noticed by the presence of unresolved fragments in
the compression zone of the gels for all the strains. There-
fore, this enzyme should be limited in its use for restric-
tion
The
combination of restriction with SmaI followed by restric-
tion with KpnI resulted in a larger number of bands and
resulted in more PFGE proﬁles (Table 5). In addition, the

combination of molecular methods demonstrated that
more than one PFGE proﬁle may be present in one farm,
in different houses (F10-H1-S3 and F10-H2-S4) or in the
same house or ﬂock (F11-H2-S4 and F11-H2-S5)
(Table 5). It is important to restrict the plugs ﬁrst with
SmaI and then with KpnI to guarantee that a larger num-
ber of strains will be restricted. The increase in the num-
ber of fragments with the SmaI ⁄ KpnI combination was
more obvious in the area below 250 kbp (Fig. 2); an ele-
ment that made the PFGE proﬁles more challenging to
analyse using the visual scoring system suggested by Te-
nover et al. (1995). Therefore, the use of ﬁngerprinting
analysis software, such as BioNumerics, appears to be
indispensable for a reliable analysis of the results obtained
with this combination.

The lack of improvement by adding formaldehyde in the
PFGE protocol strongly suggests that the lack of restriction
patterns found for some isolates and speciﬁc enzymes is
not related to the presence of DNAses in those strains
(Gibson et al. 1994), but may be related to the lack of
restriction sites or restriction site methylation. In large
eukaryotic genomes (>108 base pairs), this lack of restric-
tion, especially the CpG nucleotide deﬁciency, has been
usually associated with DNA methylation, which is almost
universal in these organisms (Bestor 1990). DNA methyla-
tion involves the addition of a methyl group to DNA bases,
primarily to carbon #5 of the cytosine pyrimidine ring.
This theory has traditionally been applied to explain the
lack of restriction of bacterial genome. However, recent
ﬁndings question this assertion and suggest that cytosine
methylation is not the primary reason for the CpG dinucle-
otide deﬁciency in bacterial genomes (Wang et al. 2004).

PFGE restriction with SmaI has been reported to be
more discriminating than MLST for outbreak investiga-

tions, although a combination of MLST plus sequencing
of the ﬂaA short variable region may provide a level of
discrimination equivalent to PFGE for outbreak investiga-
tions (Sails et al. 2003). Our comparison of the PFGE,
MLST and serotyping proﬁles of C. jejuni strains isolated
in the same geographical area suggests that the PFGE pro-
ﬁles may change quickly within C. jejuni strains and may
account
for the variety of genotypes frequently found
when analysing C. jejuni with PFGE (Table 5).

It is apparent that a ST proﬁle of C. jejuni, or clone,
appears to dominate in a geographic area for a variable
period. The prevalent ST proﬁle in our report is a new
combination of previously described alleles. The other
three MLST proﬁles found have been identiﬁed in C. jeju-
ni isolated from humans, animals and the environment.
ST-460 has been reported by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, and ST-48 and ST-353 were
described in the United Kingdom (Dingle et al. 2001,
2002). ST-48 was the most predominant ST in a study
done in New South Wales, Australia (Mickan et al. 2007),
and has been associated to serotype O:4 of the Penner se-
rotyping system (Penner and Hennessey 1980). ST-353
has been associated with O:3, O:11 and O:37 of the heat-
resistant serotyping system (Dingle et al. 2002). In our
study ST-48 was represented by O:3 and O:5 serotypes,
while ST-353 was represented only by serotype O:3. ST-
2624 was represented by all the serotypes found in this
study, including the minor O:21.

Within the individual genes, glnA and pgm showed the
highest diversity (four alleles) and the analysis of their
sequence diversity showed a variability that has been
described for other genes in C.
jejuni (Suerbaum et al.
2001). Both the diversity within genes and the analysis of
the allelic proﬁle data using SplitsTree and the UPGMA

Molecular typing of C. jejuni from Puerto Rico

suggesting

cluster analysis resulted in graphs with alleles connected
to each other by multiple pathways, with a network-like
structure
recombination (Suerbaum et al.
2001). pgm has been used to analyse the recombination of
C. jejuni from MLST data, and along with unc (atpA, ATP
synthase alpha subunit) they appear to come to C. jejuni
from other Campylobacter spp. (Fearnhead et al. 2005). In
our study, the diversity of the allelic proﬁles for unc was
minimal, with two alleles and only one base difference (C
vs T) in base 864 of the atpA gene (NCBI accession num-
ber AL111168). This is different from the variety of allelic
proﬁles, with multiple polymorphic sites, reported by
French et al. (2005) for unc alleles analysed from C. jejuni
associated to cattle in the United Kingdom. It appears
that the allelic variability for each of the seven housekeep-
ing genes for MLST proﬁles varies according to the origin
of the strains and different geographical areas.

We calculated both the index of association (IA), as
described for the analysis of the degree of linkage in mul-
tilocus enzyme electrophoresis
(Maynard Smith et al.
1993; Maynard Smith 1999), and the standardized IA
(sIA) that corrects for the number of loci analysed (Hau-
bold and Hudson 2000). The sIA value of 0Æ73 and a
calculated variance that was signiﬁcantly higher than the
expected variance (P £ 0Æ0127) suggested a high degree of
recombination among the MLST genes within this popu-
lation of C. jejuni isolates (Table 3).

MLST results have revealed that populations of differ-
ent bacteria frequently exchange genetic material, and
produce interclonal variance in virulence traits. These
ﬁndings based on molecular population genetic studies
have resulted in the tenet that the unit of bacterial patho-
genicity is the clone, or cell line (Musser 1996). However,
the analyses of linkage disequilibrium on comparison of
gene trees have revealed that few bacteria are indeed clo-
nal (Maynard Smith et al. 1993; Spratt and Maiden 1999;
Feil et al. 2001; Supply et al. 2003). In C. jejuni, a high
frequency of inter- and intraspecies recombination may
account for the high degree of variation (addition and or
deletions) of restriction sites and PFGE proﬁles found in
C. jejuni isolated from live broilers chickens (Dingle et al.
2001; Schouls et al. 2003; Potturi-Venkata et al. 2007a,b)
and retail broiler products (Dickins et al. 2002; Oyarzabal
et al. 2007a). Therefore, MLST proﬁling, although useful
in determining temporal phylogenetic comparison, may
be less discriminating for spatial, short-term epidemiolog-
ical studies of C. jejuni strains from live broilers. The fact
that we found only four ST allelic proﬁles, with one being
completely new, vs 10 different PFGE proﬁles suggest that
microrestriction proﬁling is still a powerful system for the
tracking of C. jejuni strains.

Most of the studies of cytotoxicity on Campylobacter
spp. make use of tissue culture cell models, with a sub-

characterization of

jective, qualitative
the degree of
morphological cell rounding. We measured instead the
supernatant LDH that was released upon cell lysis. Our
results measuring LDH from the cytotoxicity assays in cell
lines showed a wide range of variation that has been
described using different mammalian cell lines on C. jejuni
isolated from different sources, including broiler chickens
(Gilbert and Slavik 2004; Coote et al. 2007). The variabil-
ity of these assays is dependent on the way the assays are
performed, may appear to even change with strains over
time (Coote et al. 2007), and demonstrate that cytotoxin
production by C. jejuni is quite complex when compared
with that of other enteric pathogens (Misawa et al. 1995).
Our results showed that some strains had a high agree-
ment among the results from the same cell
line, while
other strains showed no agreement among the results
from the same cell
isolates that
grouped in the low cytotoxicity category was much smaller
than previously reported (Gilbert and Slavik 2004).
Although there is no direct correlation between the patho-
genicity of C. jejuni and the presence of the toxins (Lam
1993), cytotoxicity assays have been used to infer the
potential pathogenicity of C. jejuni isolates. For instance,
there is an important correlation between invasiveness and
colitis in patients from which the isolates were obtained,
although some strains attach to cell
lines but do not
invade the cells (Everest et al. 1992). The ﬁndings of low
toxicity reported with CHO (Nadeau et al. 2003; Coote
et al. 2007) do not correlate with the present results.

Globally, there are differences in Campylobacter antigens
and on the typability of C. jejuni strains with Penner anti-
sera and it is common to encounter strains that are untypa-
ble with this method (Eyles et al. 2006; Nielsen et al. 2006).
Some of the strains from this study were not recognized by
any antisera, and a weak serotyping found with O:21 makes
this serotype less signiﬁcant, as the titre was too low to be
compared with the titres obtained with O:3 and O:5. Sero-
type O:5 has been found in different geographical areas,
and has recently been described in C. jejuni isolates from
humans and water sources in New Zealand (Eyles et al.
2006). Campylobacter jejuni serotypes O:3 and O:5 have
been found in the blood cultures and diarrhoetic stools of
paediatric patients (Lastovica 1996). Serotype O:21 has been
also found in paediatric diarrhoeic patients, in chickens
without disease and in terminally ill ostriches with enteritis
in South Africa (A.J. Lastovica, unpublished results).

The molecular characterization of bacterial pathogens
is essential to understand the short- and long-term epi-
demiological implications of a given foodborne pathogen
(Spratt and Maiden 1999). The long-term goal of an
active surveillance programme is to predict, with high
degree of certainty, the rise and spread of an epidemic
clone with high pathogenicity potential
for humans

the cost of

(Maynard Smith et al. 1993). For weakly clonal organ-
isms molecular methods have yielded different data, and
there appears to be a lack of agreement among methods
applied to the same group of strains. For instance, dif-
ferent databases have been collected and maintained for
C. jejuni, such as ﬁngerprinting proﬁles based on PFGE
or sequencing data based on MLST. MLST results in
100% typability of
this
method (Dingle et al. 2002) and the apparent low num-
ber of alleles found in a relatively small population of
isolates may limit
its application for epidemiological
studies. Yet, the prediction of the appearance of epi-
demic clones in a given geographic area may still be
limited even if an active surveillance is in place. The
difﬁculty in interpretation of a wide range of results is a
severe limitation in studies on pathogens with high
capacity for horizontal gene transfer (Oyarzabal et al.
2007b), where even typability results may vary according
to the different methods. The small population of C. je-
juni that we sampled may be a limiting factor of this
study, but at
the
limitation of each of the methods employed for strain
characterization. The diversity found within C.
jejuni
and the lack of agreement among the different methods
suggests that studies of larger populations of strains will

In
conclusion, these results suggest that the use of more
than two typing methods may be necessary to fully
understand the variability of C. jejuni strains colonizing
