Abstract 
Background:  Campylobacter is considered to be the leading cause of human bacterial gastroenteritis, of which poul-
try is the main reservoir. Campylobacter contaminated chicken products are a major cause of human Campylobacter 
infection. In this study, the prevalence of Campylobacter in chicken in central China was investigated, and the geno-
typic diversity, antimicrobial resistance and biofilm of these isolates were characterized.
Results:  A total of 206 Campylobacter isolates, including 166 C. jejuni and 40 C. coli, were isolated from chicken farms 
and live poultry markets in central China. Multilocus sequence typing and phylogenetic analysis showed that the 
Campylobacter isolates had diverse genetic backgrounds, which covered most of the dominant clone complexes 
(CCs) reported throughout China. The most prevalent CCs were CC-464, CC-1150, CC-353, and CC-828. All the iso-
lates showed resistance to norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and Cefazolin, and a prevalent resistance to fluoroquinolones, 
β-lactams and tetracyclines was also observed. Among all the isolates, 133 strains showed the ability to form biofilm, 
thereinto, the isolates in two genetic branches, mainly including CC-21, CC-48, CC-677 and CC-45, showed a signifi-
cantly lower ability to form biofilm than other genetic branches (p < 0.05). However, in general, the ability to form 
biofilm varied among different genetic branches, suggesting a complex genetic background to biofilm formation, but 
not only the genetic lineages. Compared with the strains unable to form biofilm, biofilm-producing strains possessed 
a significantly higher resistance to ampicillin, neomycin, sulfamethoxazole, amikacin, clindamycin and erythromycin 
(p < 0.05).
Conclusions:  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the relationship of the genotypic diversity, 
antimicrobial resistance and biofilm-forming abilities of Campylobacter isolated from chicken in Central China, which 
showed the potential importance of biofilm in antimicrobial resistance. This study will help us better understand the 
epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter.

Background
Campylobacter is considered to be the leading cause of 
human bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide [1], account-
ing for an estimated 500 million infections per year glob-
ally [2]. In severe cases of C. jejuni infection, individuals 
may develop post infection complications associated with 
Guillain Barré Syndrome [3]. In North China, 36 cases of 
Guillain Barré Syndrome, resulted from C. jejuni infec-
tion, were reported in 2007 [4].

Campylobacter species, mainly including C. jejuni and 
C. coli, widely colonize in the intestinal tract of wild and 
domesticated animals and birds [5–7]. Chicken is one of 
the most popular animal-based food sources worldwide, 
which is also the reservoir of Campylobacter. Campylo-
bacter-contaminated chicken products are a major cause 
of human Campylobacter infection [8], which highlights 
its potential public health threat. Several epidemiologic 
studies on Campylobacter have been carried out in some 
parts of China. From 2008 to 2014, Wang et al. reported 
that the positive rates of C. jejuni and C. coli were 18.1 
and  19.0%  respectively  in  five  provinces  of  China  [9]. 
Zhang et al. analyzed the genetic diversity of the C. jejuni 
isolates in Eastern China by multilocus sequence typing 
(MLST) and identified 94 sequence types (STs) belong-
ing to 18 clonal complexes (CCs) [10]. However, data on 
the prevalence and genetic diversity of Campylobacter is 
still limited in China, especially central China, which is 
an important transportation junction.

Moreover,  Campylobacter  isolates  have  raised  great 
concerns  due  to  a  frequent  emergence  of  resistance  to 
fluoroquinolone, erythromycin, and other drugs [11, 12], 
which limits treatment alternatives. Therefore, analysis of 
antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter in the poultry 
industry will contribute to managing cognate infections 
and mitigating the emergence of antimicrobial resistant 
strains.  Recent  years,  the  multidrug-resistant  Campy-
lobacter have been frequently isolated, and a high anti-
microbial  resistance  rate  of  Campylobacter,  especially 
to  fluoroquinolone,  has  been  reported  in  many  areas 
[13–15].  Multi-drug  resistance  of  Campylobacter  is 
more severe in China where the resistance to fluoroqui-
nolones was reported to be as high as 98% in some areas 
[16, 17]. Although some of the mechanisms accounting 
for antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter have been 
revealed  [11,  18,  19],  some  possible  factors  may  also 
attribute to the raise of antimicrobial resistance, such as 
the ability of biofilm formation.

Our  previous  study  has  shown  that  the  Campylobac-
ter positive rate was 17.2%, with bacterial count varying 
from 3.6 to 360 most-probable-number (MPN)/g in the 
positive samples of chicken meats collected from markets 
in central China [20]. Studying the prevalence of Campy-
lobacter in live chicken and their surroundings will help 

us  further  control  these  pathogens.  In  this  study,  we 
investigated the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance and 
genetic diversity of Campylobacter strains isolated from 
chicken farms and markets in central China, which is one 
of the most important livestock and poultry circulation 
centers. We also tested the biofilm-forming ability of the 
Campylobacter isolates and analyzed the potential corre-
lation among biofilm formation, genotypes, and antimi-
crobial resistance.

Methods
Sampling and isolation of Campylobacter
From  2012  to  2016,  a  total  of  817  samples,  including 
317 anal swabs, 15 soils and 12 aerosols collected from 
chicken farms, and 448 anal swabs, 15 soils and 10 aero-
sols collected from live poultry markets, were collected 
in central China (3 farms and 4 markets in Hubei, 2 farms 
and 3 markets in Henan, 2 farms and 2 markets in Jiangxi 
and 1 farm and 2 markets in Anhui). In each sampling 
site,  35–45  anal  swabs  were  collected.  In  parts  of  sam-
pling sites, 2 aerosol samples and 3 soil samples were col-
lected. Freshly collected anal swabs or soils were kept into 
Cary-Blair modified transport media (AMRESCO, USA). 
Aerosols (375 L/sample) were collected using BioSamper 
(SKC  Ltd,  USA).  The  samples  were  transported  to  the 
laboratory for Campylobacter isolation. The samples were 
resuspended in PBS which were used to inoculate Bolton 
broth  containing  Campylobacter  growth  and  selective 
supplements (Oxoid, England) and incubated at 42 °C for 
24 h in air tight jars containing the AnaeroPack (Mitsubi-
shi, Japan) to generate a microaerobic condition. 100 µl of 
the culture was spread onto a modified charcoal cefoper-
azone deoxycholate agar (mCCDA, Oxoid) plate contain-
ing Campylobacter selective supplements and incubated 
for 48 h at 42 °C under microaerobic condition [21]. The 
suspected Campylobacter colonies were further purified 
and identified by PCR as described [22]. C. jejuni and C. 
coli  were  differentiated  by  hippuric  acid  hydrolysis  test 
and  PCR  test  [6].  The  identified  Campylobacter  strains 
were stored at − 80 °C in MH broth containing 30% (v/v) 
glycerol.

Antibiotic resistance profiles
The  antibiotic  susceptibility  of  the  isolates  was  deter-
mined by the disk diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton 
Agar (MHA, Oxoid) according to the Clinical and Labo-
ratory  Standards  Institute  Standards  guidelines  [23].  A 
total  of  11  antibiotics  were  tested,  including  ampicillin 
(Amp, 10 μg), Ceftriaxone (Cet, 30 μg), Cefazolin (Cez, 
30 μg), amikacin (Ami, 30 μg), Neomycin (Neo, 30 μg), 
tetracycline (Tet, 10 μg), sulfamethoxazole (Sul, 300 μg), 
clindamycin (Cli, 10 μg), erythromycin (Ery, 10 μg), cip-
rofloxacin (Cip, 5 μg) and norfloxacin (Nor, 10 μg). After

incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, the diameters (in mm) of 
the inhibition zones were measured. E. coli strain ATCC 
25922 and C. jejuni strain ATCC 33560 were used as the 
quality control.

Biofilm assays
Biofilm formation was assessed as described [24]. Briefly, 
overnight cultured cells were adjusted to an  OD590nm of 
0.1  in  Brucella  medium  (Oxoid)  supplemented  with  5% 
(v/v) chicken juice. To allow biofilm formation, 1 ml of 
the  cell  culture  was  added  to  a  24-well  polystyrene  tis-
sue culture plate (Corning) which was incubated at 37 °C 
under  microaerobic  condition  for  48  h  before  stain-
ing. For crystal violet staining, cells were discarded and 
each well was washed with water, and the plate was then 
dried at 60 °C for 30 min. One milliliter of 1% crystal vio-
let  solution  was  added  to  each  well,  and  the  plate  was 
incubated on a rocker at room temperature for 30 min. 
Unbound  crystal  violet  was  washed  off  with  water  and 
the  plate  was  dried  at  37  °C.  Bound  crystal  violet  was 
dissolved  in  20%  (v/v)  acetone-containing  ethanol  for 
10 min. The dissolved crystal violet was then poured into 
cuvettes and  OD630nm was measured. All the tests were 
performed in triplicate. Three wells were subject to the 
same  treatment  but  without  bacteria  inoculated,  which 
were used as the negative control. The cutoff OD value 
(ODc) was defined as two times of the negative control 
value as previously reported [25, 26]. Based on the OD 
values,  strains  were  classified  into  the  following  three 
categories: non-biofilm producer (OD ≤ ODc), weak bio-
film producer (ODc < OD ≤ 2 × ODc) and strong biofilm 
producer (2 × ODc < OD).
MLST typing
In order to determine the genetic diversity of the Campy-
lobacter  isolates  and  their  relationship,  MLST  analysis 

was  carried  out  as  previously  described  [27].  Briefly, 
genomic DNA was extracted using MiniBEST Universal 
Genomic  DNA  Extraction  Kit  (TaKaRa,  Dalian,  China) 
according  to  the  manufacturer’s  instructions.  MLST 
analysis  was  conducted  by  sequencing  seven  Campylo-
bacter housekeeping genes (aspA, glnA, gltA, glyA, pgm, 
tkt,  and  uncA).  The  primers  sets  for  these  seven  genes 
and  their  amplification  conditions  were  used  as  previ-
ously described [27]. Amplification products were puri-
fied  and  sequenced.  Allele  numbers,  sequence  types 
(STs)  and  clonal  complexes  (CCs)  were  assigned  using 
the Campylobacter MLST database (http://pubmlst.org/
Campylobacter/).  Novel  STs  were  submitted  to  MLST 
database and assigned new numbers. Consensus network 
of the calculated tree was constructed by SliptsTree 4 ver-
sion 1.2 using the multi-aligned core genome sequence of 
the different STs.

Statistical analysis
Chi  square  was  used  to  determine  the  significance  of 
resistance rates in different biofilm-forming groups and 
to compare the isolation rates of C. jejuni and C. coli. For 
analyzing the biofilm-forming abilities, the mean OD val-
ues (mean ± SEM) of isolates in each clade were calcu-
lated, and two-tailed t tests were used to determine the 
significance  of  the  biofilm-forming  abilities  in  different 
clades p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Prevalence of Campylobacter
As shown in Table 1, 206 Campylobacter strains (positive 
rate 25.2%) were isolated, including 156 C. jejuni and 38 
C. coli from anal swab samples, 5 C. jejuni and 2 C. coli 
from soil samples, and 5 C. jejuni from aerosol samples. 
The isolation rate of C. jejuni was higher than that of C. 
coli (20.3% vs 4.9%, p = 0.000). Among these isolates, 66

C. jejuni (positive rate 19.2%) and 19 C. coli (positive rate 
5.5%) were isolated from the 344 samples collected from 
poultry farms, and 100 C. jejuni (positive rate 21.1%) and 
21 C. coli (positive rate 4.4%) were isolated from the 473 
samples collected from live poultry markets.

Genetic diversity of Campylobacter
MLST was performed to determine the genetic diversity 
and clonal origins of the Campylobacter isolates, and the 
details  of  MLST  results  have  been  listed  in  Additional 
file 1: Table S1. As shown in Fig. 1, 206 isolates contained 
a total of 72 different STs in our test. Among these iso-
lates, 146 out of the 206 isolates possessed 50 different 
STs  which  belonged  to  15  CCs.  The  remaining  60  iso-
lates  belonged  to  22  different  unassigned  STs.  40  novel 
STs harboring 106 isolates were isolated for the first time. 
CC-464  was  the  most  frequently  isolated  clonal  com-
plex  which  contained  33  isolates  belonging  to  ten  STs, 
and accounted for 16.0% (33/206) of all the isolates. The 
major clonal complexes also included CC-1150 (n = 25, 
12.1%),  CC-353  (n  =  22,  10.7%)  and  CC-828  (n  =  16, 
7.8%). The isolates collected from markets covered 61 STs 
belonging to 12 CCs and unassigned, while those isolated 
from chicken farms harbored 45 STs belonging to 12 CCs 
and unassigned.

All the STs were classified into five major clades (Fig. 1). 
Clade 1 covered most of the isolates, including the two 
major clonal complexes CC-464 and CC-353. All of the 
C. coli isolates belonging to CC-1150 and CC-828 were 
clustered in clade 2. The isolates recovered from chicken 
markets and farms shared nine out of the fifteen clonal 
complexes  and  all  the  clades  contained  isolates  recov-
ered from chicken farms and markets, suggesting that the 
isolates collected from the two places might share same 
origins.

Antimicrobial resistance profiles of Campylobacter
As shown in Fig. 2a, all of the C. jejuni and C. coli iso-
lates showed resistance to norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and 
Cefazolin. A high rate of resistance to tetracycline, cef-
triaxone  and  ampicillin  has  also  been  observed  for  the 
isolates, among which 89.69% of the C. jejuni and 90.24% 
of the C. coli were resistant to tetracycline; 82.42% of the 
C. jejuni and 97.56% of the C. coli were resistant to cef-
triaxone; and 76.36.5% of the C. jejuni and 82.93% of the 
C. coli were resistant to ampicillin. The isolates showed a 
relative low rate of resistance to amikacin (4.85% of the 
C. jejuni and 21.95% of the C. coli), neomycin (10.91% of 
the C. jejuni and 14.63% of the C. coli), and erythromycin 
(12.12% of the C. jejuni and 26.83% of the C. coli). Except 
for  sulfamethoxazole  and  the  three  drugs  which  all  the 
isolates were resistant to, the resistance rates of C. jejuni 
were lower than that of C. coli in this study.

As shown in Fig. 2b, all the isolates were resistant to 
at least three tested antimicrobial agents, among which 
95.1% of the isolates were resistant to more than five anti-
biotics. There were four C. jejuni and two C. coli strains 
that were resistant to all the eleven antimicrobial agents 
tested.  However,  one  C.  jejuni  strain  showed  sensitiv-
ity  to  most  of  the  antibiotics,  which  was  only  resistant 
to three of antimicrobial agents tested. In general, most 
of the isolates were resistant to 5–7 antimicrobial agents 
tested.  The  most  frequent  multidrug  resistance  pattern 
was resistance to ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, tetracycline, 
ampicillin,  ceftriaxone  and  cefazolin,  which  covered  54 
isolates (Additional file 1: Table S1).

Biofilm formation of Campylobacter isolates
The  cutoff  OD  value  (ODc)  to  define  a  biofilm  pro-
ducer was determined as  OD630nm = 0.279 as previously 
described [26]. The  OD630nm values generated by crystal 
violet  staining  of  each  isolate  were  listed  in  Additional 
file 1: Table S1. Based on the biofilm-forming ability, 206 
Campylobacter  isolates  were  classified  to  three  groups 
(Table 2, Fig. 3). Seventy-three isolates (35.4%) were iden-
tified  as  non-biofilm  producers   (OD630  ≤  0.279),  while 
133  isolates  (64.6%)  were  biofilm  producers.  Among 
these biofilm producers, 113 isolates were weak biofilm 
producers (0.279 < OD630 ≤ 0.558) and 20 isolates were 
strong biofilm producers  (OD630 > 0.558). All the soil iso-
lates and aerosol isolates were biofilm producers.

Correlation between biofilm formation and antimicrobial 
resistance
As shown in Table 2, both biofilm producers and non-
biofilm  producers  showed  a  high  rate  of  resistance  to 
ceftriaxone,  cefazolin,  tetracycline  and  two  fluoroqui-
nolones  drugs  including  ciprofloxacin  and  norfloxacin. 
However, compared with non-biofilm producers, biofilm 
producers possessed a higher rate of resistance to ampi-
cillin  (88.0%  vs  58.9%, p =  0.000),  neomycin  (18.0%  vs 
2.7%, p = 0.002) and sulfamethoxazole (48.9% vs 8.2%, 
p = 0.000). Moreover, all of the non-biofilm producers 
were  sensitive  to  amikacin,  clindamycin  and  erythro-
mycin.  In  contrast,  strong  biofilm  producers  showed 
a resistance rate of more than 90% to clindamycin and 
erythromycin.  Six  isolates,  which  were  resistant  to  all 
the  types  of  antibiotics  tested,  were  biofilm  producers. 
Among  them,  four  out  of  the  six  isolates  were  strong 
biofilm  producers  (Additional  file  1:  Table  S1).  These 
results  suggested  that  the  ability  of  biofilm  formation 
had a positive correlation with antimicrobial resistance 
of  the  Campylobacter  isolates.  However,  there  was  an 
exception that compared with the non-biofilm produc-
ers, the biofilm producers showed a lower rate of resist-
ance to tetracycline.

Correlation between biofilm formation and genotypes
As  shown  in  Figs.  1  and  3,  206  Campylobacter  isolates 
fell  into  five  clades,  of  which  clade  1  and  2  had  more 
members  than  the  other  clades.  The  mean  OD  values 
in  each  clade  were  as  follows:  clade  1  =  0.37  ±  0.01, 
clade  2  =  0.37  ±  0.02,  clade  3  =  0.25  ±  0.04,  clade 
4 = 0.26 ± 0.03 and clade 5 = 0.31 ± 0.03. Although all 
of the strong biofilm producers were present in clade 1 
and clade 2, strains in these two clades exhibited different 
levels  of  abilities  to  form  biofilm,  which  suggested  that 
the ability of biofilm formation varied among the domi-
nant  genotypes  of  Campylobacter.  75%  of  the  strains 
(20/25) in clade 3 and clade 4 were non-biofilm produc-
ers and the ability of biofilm-formation of the strains in 
these two clades was significantly lower than that of the 

other  clades  (clade  3  vs  clade  1,  p  =  0.007;  clade  3  vs 
clade 2, p = 0.013; clade 4 vs clade 1, p = 0.012; clade 4 
vs clade 2, p = 0.020). Strains which belonged to CC-21, 
CC-48,  CC-677,  CC-45  and  a  few  unassigned  isolates 
were included in these two clades.

Discussion
Poultry  are  recognized  as  a  main  reservoir  of  Campy-
lobacter.  Consumption  of  poultry  is  considered  to  be 
an  important  cause  of  human  infection  with  Campy-
lobacter,  and  leads  to  extensive  spread  antimicrobial 
resistance  [28].  In  this  study,  Campylobacter  strains 
were isolated from 25.2% of the samples collected from 
chicken farms and markets, including 166 C. jejuni and 
40  C.  coli.  According  to  several  previous  reports,  the

in  the  same  region  [21].  Most  of  these  CCs  (CC-464, 
CC-1150,  CC-353  and  CC-828)  were  also  frequently 
identified  in  diarrhea  patients  worldwide  [33,  34].  In 
North  China,  the  most  frequently  isolated  clonal  com-
plexes  were  CC-21,  CC-353,  CC-354  and  CC-443  [31, 
35], while the dominant clonal complexes of C. coli were 
CC-828 and CC-1150 [36]. In East China, the most com-
mon ST type of the Campylobacter strains isolated from 
human and food was ST-353, while the dominant ST type 
from chicken and food was ST-354 [10]. In Guangdong, 
a province in southern China, the dominant clonal com-
plex was CC-828 [37]. It seems that the dominant clonal 
complexes  of  Campylobacter  were  discrepant  in  differ-
ent regions. However, most of the CCs reported in these 
regions  had  been  isolated  in  our  study,  which  may  be 
because  central  China,  where  all  the  samples  were  col-
lected, is one of the most important livestock and poultry 
circulation centers in our country.

A  total  of  40  novel  STs  were  identified  in  this  study. 
Genetic  relationship  analysis  showed  that  different 
sources  of  isolates  have  a  crossed  distribution  in  each 
clonal group and most of the novel STs only have a minor 
variation with a close phylogenetic relationship to known 
CCs. Selection forces, such as differences in temperature, 
structure  and  biochemical  and  immunological  habitats, 
may accelerate the evolution to gain the ability to persist 
in different enteric environments and survive in different 
environments  during  transmission.  Clade  1  and  2  con-
tained lots of small genetic branches, which may be due 
to the adaptive evolution of isolates in these two clades 
occurred more frequently in our investigated regions.

Another  more  important  selection  pressure  might 
be the usage of antibiotics, which could cause heritable 
genetic mutations and horizontal resistance gene trans-
fer, leading to serious antimicrobial resistance in Campy-
lobacter [11, 38]. More seriously, some of the antibiotics 
to which the Campylobacter isolates were resistant were 
used  as  therapeutic  drugs  in  severe  cases  of  infection 
[39]. Although resistance rates varied in different regions, 
in general high resistance rates, especially to fluoroqui-
nolones, were found in most of the studies in China. For 
example,  in  Zhang  et  al.’s  study,  the  resistance  rate  of 
Campylobacter  to  ciprofloxacin  was  100%,  and  94%  to 
tetracycline,  61%  to  erythromycin,  and  50%  to  ampicil-
lin [36]. Chen et al. reported that more than 98% of the 
tested Campylobacter isolates were resistant to quinolo-
nes  and  tetracycline  [40].  Even  as  early  as  in  2002,  the 
prevalence  of  quinolone  resistance  of  the  isolates  had 
been  up  to  85.9%  in  Hong  Kong  [41].  Low  resistance 
rates  of  Campylobacter  were  only  reported  in  North-
west  China  [42].  In  our  study,  a  very  high  resistance 
rate to β-lactams, tetracyclines and fluoroquinones was 
observed (Fig. 2), and a high resistance rate to the other 

Fig. 3  Biofilm-forming abilities of Campylobacter isolates belonging 
to different clonal complexes. The bottom broken lines indicate the 
cutoff value (ODc = 0.279) and twofold cutoff value (ODc = 0.558). 
Based on the OD values, the strains were classified in three cat-
egories: non-biofilm producer (OD ≤ ODc), weak biofilm producer 
(ODc < OD ≤ 2 × ODc) and strong biofilm producer (2 × ODc < OD)

positive detection rate of Campylobacter in poultry farms 
varies largely between different regions, ranging from 2 
to 100%, and the prevalence of Campylobacter is lower in 
Scandinavian countries than in other European countries, 
North America, and developing countries [29]. China is 
the biggest developing country in which a diverse preva-
lence rate has also been reported in different parts of the 
country. For example, Huang et al. revealed that C. jejuni 
was frequently detected in poultry, with an average isola-
tion rate of up to 18.61% [30]. Wang et al. showed that 
the positive rates of C. jejuni and C. coli were 18.1 and 
19.0% respectively in chicken in five provinces of China 
[9]. In Tianjin, the contamination rates of C. jejuni and 
other Campylobacter species were 13.7 and 5.7% respec-
tively [31]. In this study, our data showed that the positive 
rate of C. jejuni was a bit higher than most of the other 
studies carried out in China. We also found that Campy-
lobacter existed in the soils and aerosols of chicken farms 
and markets, suggesting that the pathogens were widely 
spreading  between  host  and  surroundings.  This  situa-
tion  makes  it  harder  for  us  to  control  Campylobacter 
infection. A prevalence and risk assessment of C. jejuni 
in chicken in China suggested that key efforts should be 
made, especially in chick breeding and chicken prepara-
tion processes [32].

In our study, MLST analysis showed a total of 72 dif-
ferent  STs  belonging  to  15  CCs  and  some  unassigned 
clonal complexes. The major clonal complexes included 
CC-464,  CC-1150,  CC-353,  and  CC-828,  which  were 
similar  to  our  previous  investigation  on  chicken  meat 

Zhang et al. Gut Pathog  (2017) 9:62

drugs, such as erythromycin, was also found in the strong 
biofilm producers (Table 2). Our previous study showed 
that all of the fluoroquinolone-resistant strains contained 
a  Thr-86-Ile  substitution  in  GyrA,  and  that  the  CmeR-
Box  variations  increased  the  expression  of  CmeABC 
efflux pump which led to the high resistance [43]. Over-
expression of drug efflux pump may not only contribute 
to  fluoroquinolones  resistance,  but  also  increase  resist-
ance to other drugs [44–46]. Bacteria exposing in efflux 
inhibitors or mutants in efflux pumps showed decreased 
biofilm, which suggested that efflux pumps also contrib-
uted to their biofilm formation [47, 48]. Although more 
resistance mechanisms need to be revealed, efflux pumps 
seem to play important roles in antimicrobial resistance 
as well as biofilm formation.

Biofilms  are  sessile  communities  of  bacterial  cells 
enclosed  in  a  self-produced  extracellular  polysaccha-
ride  matrix,  which  plays  an  important  role  in  evad-
ing  host  immune  clearance  and  resisting  antimicrobial 
agents, leading to persistent and chronic infections [26]. 
Campylobacter may form a monospecies biofilm, which 
protects them from environmental stress, including anti-
biotic  treatment  [24].  In  our  tested  strains,  64.6%  were 
identified  to  be  biofilm  producers.  Comparing  with  the 
non-biofilm producers, the biofilm producers possessed 
a  higher  resistance  rate  to  ampicillin,  neomycin,  sul-
famethoxazole, amikacin, clindamycin and erythromycin. 
Although studies on the correlation between biofilm and 
antimicrobial resistance were limited in Campylobacter, 
positive  impact  of  biofilm  on  reducing  the  permeation 
of  ampicillin  has  been  reported  in  other  bacteria  [49]. 
Some regulators, such as LuxS, have also been reported 
to  be  linked  to  biofilm  formation  and  antimicrobial 
resistance  in  some  bacteria  [50].  We  found  an  excep-
tion that the resistance rate to tetracycline was higher in 
non-biofilm  producing  isolates  than  in  biofilm  produc-
ing strains, it may be due to the high distribution of the 
resistance genes in non-biofilm producing isolates, such 
as tet [51]. It is interesting that all of the soil isolates and 
aerosol isolates were biofilm producers, which suggested 
that biofilm might be an important factor to help strain 
to survive in the surroundings as well as in the host. Our 
study on the biofilm-forming characteristics of Campylo-
bacter isolates would help us understand the increasing 
resistance to antibiotics of Campylobacter as well as their 
pathogenicity to host.

In clade 3 and clade 4, 75% of the strains (20/25) were 
non-biofilm producers and the biofilm-forming abilities 
in  these  two  clades  were  significantly  lower  than  other 
clades (p < 0.05). The closely related strains may have a 
common ancestor, and STs developing from one biofilm-
forming  ST  origin  may  share  better  biofilm-forming 
ability.  The  correlation  of  the  origin  and  phylogenetic 

relationship between their C. jejuni isolates and biofilm-
forming  abilities  has  also  been  reported  [52].  Previous 
studies also showed that some gene variants were asso-
ciated with different C. jejuni multilocus sequence types, 
such as fspA [53] and capA [54]. The association between 
biofilm  related  genes  and  multilocus  sequence  types 
needs to be further studied. However, isolates within the 
same clade also exhibited varied abilities to form biofilm 
in our study. Ben et al. analyzed the genome sequences of 
strains with different biofilm-forming abilities, and found 
that three genes were associated with the increased bio-
film  formation  in  CC-21  and  43  genes  in  CC-45,  but 
there was no overlap between these two CCs [55]. These 
results suggested a complex genetic correlation between 
genetic background and biofilm formation.

Conclusions
In  the  present  study,  a  high  prevalence  and  genotypic 
diversity  were  observed  in  the  Campylobacter  strains 
isolated  in  chicken  in  central  China.  We  analyzed  the 
correlation  among  biofilm-forming  abilities,  MLST 
genotype  and  antimicrobial  resistance,  which  revealed 
a  positive  correlation  between  resistance  rate  and  the 
ability  of  biofilm-forming.  This  study  will  help  us  bet-
ter  understand  the  epidemiology  and  resistance  of 
Campylobacter.
