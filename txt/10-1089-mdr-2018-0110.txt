Prevalence of Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase-Producing

Gram-Negative Bacilli and Emergence of mcr-1 Colistin

Resistance Gene in Lebanese Swine Farms

Livestock are considered reservoirs of multidrug-resistant organisms that can be transferred to humans through
direct/indirect routes. Once transmitted, these organisms can be responsible for infections with therapeutic
challenges. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of extended-spectrum cephalosporin and
colistin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli in Lebanese swine farms. In May 2017, 114 fecal samples were col-
lected from swine farms in south Lebanon. Separate media supplemented with cefotaxime, ertapenem, and
colistin were used for the screening of resistant organisms. Double-disk synergy test and ampC disk test were
performed to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and ampC producers, respectively. Detection of
beta-lactamase and mcr genes was performed using real time PCR. Of 114 fecal samples, 76 showed growth on
the medium with cefotaxime. In total, 111 strains were isolated with 94.5% being Escherichia coli. Phenotypic
tests showed that 98, 6, and 7 strains were ESBL, ampC, and ESBL/ampC producers, respectively. CTX-M and
CMY were the main beta-lactamase genes detected. On the medium with colistin, 19 samples showed growth.
In total, 23 colistin-resistant E. coli strains harboring the mcr-1 gene were isolated. This is the ﬁrst study in
Lebanon determining multidrug resistance epidemiology in pigs. The prevalence of ESBLs is high and the
emergence of colistin resistance is alarming.

Introduction

R esistance in Gram-negative bacilli

toward the
most common antibiotics administered in the human
medicine, that is, beta-lactams has signiﬁcantly increased in
the past decade.1 Resistance to beta-lactams and carbapenems
in Gram-negative bacteria is mainly mediated through the
production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs),
ampC beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases.1 Genes encoding
these enzymes are often colocalized on plasmids harboring
resistance genes to other commonly prescribed antibiotics in
human medicine such as aminoglycosides and quinolones.1
Dissemination of resistant organisms often results in reducing
the efﬁcacy of beta-lactam antibiotics, thus limiting treatment
options of infectious diseases.2

This is currently emphasized with the recent emergence
of colistin resistance in Gram-negative bacilli. Colistin be-
longs to the polymyxin antibiotics family that acts on the
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) chain of the bacteria and leads
to increased permeability of the outer membrane and sub-
sequent cellular leakage followed by cell death.3 In human

medicine history, colistin was abandoned because of its
nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity inside human body.4 How-
ever, because of the widespread multidrug-resistant (MDR)
organisms, mainly carbapenem-resistant organisms, colistin
was reintroduced in clinical settings.5 This antibiotic revival
had to face the emergence of colistin resistance in bacteria
of human and animal origin.6

Before 2015, colistin resistance was thought to be only
mediated through chromosomal mutations that leads to the
alteration of the lipid A subunit of the LPS chain by the
addition of 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (l-Ara4N) and/or
phosphoethanolamine (PEtN),6 thus resulting in a reduced
binding to colistin and subsequently bacterial resistance.6
However, in 2016, Liu et al. reported the ﬁrst detection of a
transferable phosphoenolamine transferase named mcr-1 gene
in Escherichia coli strains isolated from pigs and meat.7 In
this context, mcr-1 was reported from clinical and animal
isolates across all continents. Furthermore, mcr variants, that
is, mcr-2,8 mcr-3,9 mcr-4,10 and mcr-511 have also emerged.
Nowadays, farm animals are considered reservoirs of anti-
microbial resistance.12 The unregulated use of antibiotics is

considered among the most common drivers for the emer-
gence of resistance in livestock.13 Indeed, antibiotics are
given not only for treatment but are also prescribed for
prophylaxis and administered as growth promoters.13 The
major public health concern about multidrug resistance
spread in animals is the potential transmission to humans
through direct contact or indirectly through the consump-
tion of undercooked/uncooked animal-origin food.14 Once
transmitted, these organisms can cause infections with lim-
ited therapeutic options, especially those cross-resistant to
antibiotics frequently used in the human medicine.15

In Lebanon, the dissemination of MDR organisms in the
clinical settings is well documented16–20; however, studies
addressing multidrug resistance in animals remain scarce.
One study carried by Diab et al. showed a relatively high
prevalence of the CTX-M-15 ESBL type in E. coli of cattle
origin in Lebanon.21 More recently, a nationwide study
conducted in Lebanese chicken farms reported an elevated
level of ESBL/ampC-producing Gram-negative bacilli in-
testinal carriage.22 Recently, our group reported the ﬁrst
detection of an E. coli isolated from poultry in south Le-
banon harboring the mcr-1 colistin resistance gene in ad-
dition to the TEM-135-like ESBL gene.23 In pigs, only one
study reported the detection of an OXA-23-producing
Acinetobacter baumannii in northern Lebanon.24 The prev-
alence of MDR organisms in the Lebanese swine farms
remains unknown. In collaboration with the ministry of
agriculture, the aim of this study was to determine the prev-
alence of extended-spectrum cephalosporin and colistin-
resistant Gram-negative bacilli in Lebanese swine farms.

Materials and Methods

Ethics statement and collection of samples

The Ministry of Agriculture in Lebanon approved the
collection of fecal samples from swine farms. The sampling
was realized in compliance with the national guidelines for
animal safety. On May 30, 2017, 111 fecal samples were
randomly collected from 3 different swine farms located in
south Lebanon. In addition, three fecal samples were taken
from three wild pigs living in the same region. The number
of samples collected was relatively proportional to the farms
size that ranged from 20 to 120 pigs per farm (Table 1). The
fecal samples were collected using sterile urine cups and

directly placed in a portable refrigerator; then when taken to
the university laboratory, they were stored at -80°C until
being used.

Screening of resistant organisms and identiﬁcation

Each fecal sample was mixed in a sterile container and
then a swab was used to subculture a considerable amount
on MacConkey agars supplemented separately with cefo-
taxime (2 mg/mL), ertapenem (1 mg/mL), and colistin (4 mg/L)
for the screening of resistant Gram-negative bacilli. After
overnight incubation at 37°C, isolated colonies with differ-
ent morphologies were separately taken from each plate and
identiﬁed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) with a
score value ‡1.9 using the Microﬂex LT spectrometer
(Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany).25 Thereafter,
the
strains were conserved in 40% glycerol aliquots at -80°C
for further tests.

Antibiotic susceptibility testing

ciproﬂoxacin,

gentamicin,
and

Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using the
Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion method and interpreted according
to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Testing (EUCAST) guidelines 2017.26 A total of 16 anti-
biotics were tested involving 11 beta-lactams (ampicillin,
amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, aztreonam, cefotaxime, cefta-
zidime, cefoxitin [FOX], cefepime, piperacillin–tazobactam,
ertapenem, meropenem, imipenem) and 5 non-beta-lactams
(colistin,
trimethoprim–
sulfamethoxazole
tigecycline; Bio-Rad, Marnes-
la-Coquette, France). The phenotypic detection of ESBL was
performed using the double-disk synergy test by placing an
amoxicillin–clavulanic acid disk between cefepime, ceftazi-
dime, and aztreonam. Formation of a keyhole effect was
considered as a phenotypic indication of ESBL production.
Regarding screening of ampC beta-lactamase and carbape-
nemase production, ampC disk test and carba NP test were
performed, respectively, as previously described.27,28 Fur-
thermore, all isolates having a narrow diameter zone of in-
hibition around the colistin disk were subjected to colistin
broth microdilution test as previously described.26 An isolate
is termed as MDR if this latter was resistant to three different
classes of antibiotics at least.29

PCR identiﬁcation of beta-lactamase genes

All isolates showing a keyhole effect or having resistance
to both cefoxitin and cefepime were subjected to real-time
PCR analysis for blaCTX-M, blaSHV, and blaTEM genes
screening.30 Furthermore, all strains found positive to the
ampC disk test were also tested for genes encoding ampC
beta-lactamases FOX, MOX, ACC, EBC, DHA, and CMY
using simplex PCRs.31 DNA extraction was performed using
EZ1 DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France),
following manufacturer instructions with an EZ1 Advanced
XL biorobot.

Molecular characterization of mcr-1 colistin
resistance gene

All strains having a colistin minimum inhibitory con-
centration (MIC) ‡2 mg/mL were subjected to standard PCR
ampliﬁcation and sequencing for the detection of mcr-1
colistin resistance gene. DNA extraction was carried out
using an EZ1 DNA extraction kit (Qiagen) with an EZ1
Advanced XL biorobot. Primers used in molecular analysis
were previously described in other studies.32

Results

Prevalence of beta-lactamase producers
and colistin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli

Of 114 fecal samples collected, 76 (66.5%) showed
positive growth on the selective medium supplemented with
cefotaxime. In total, 111 MDR strains were isolated ac-
cording to the following distribution: 65 strains in farm 1, 9
in farm 2, 35 in farm 3, and 2 isolates from the wild pigs.
MALDI-TOF MS identiﬁcation revealed that E. coli made
up to 94.5% of isolated MDR strains, Escherichia fergusonii
3.5%, and Klebsiella pneumoniae 2% (Table 1). Besides, 23
colistin-resistant E. coli strains isolated from 19 fecal sam-
ples were obtained. No carbapenemase producers were de-
tected in this study.

Phenotypic proﬁles of beta-lactamase producers

The resistance proﬁles of isolated ESBL and/or ampC-
producing Gram-negative bacilli are summarized in Table 2.
All ESBL/ampC-producing strains were susceptible to co-
listin and carbapenems. Carba np test, double-disk synergy
test, and ampC disk test revealed the absence of carbape-
nemase producers, 98 isolates (88.5%) were categorized as
ESBL producers, 7 (6%) as ESBL/ampC coproducers, and 6
strains (5.5%) as solely ampC producers. K. pneumoniae
isolates were only ESBL producers, whereas three E. fer-
gusonii were categorized as ampC producers and one as an
ESBL producer. Coproduction of ESBL and ampC was
only detected in E. coli
isolates. Regarding non-beta-
lactam antibiotics resistance in the aforementioned strains,
one isolate was coresistant to all non-beta-lactams tested:
tigecycline, gentamicin, ciproﬂoxacin, and trimethoprim–
sulfamethoxazole, 32 (29%) were co-resistant to 3 non-
beta-lactams, 59 (53%) to 2 non-beta-lactams, 16 (14%) to
1 non-beta-lactam, and three strains were susceptible to all
non-beta-lactam antibiotics. Overall, 83% of beta-
lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacilli in this study
were co-resistant to at least two non-beta-lactams.

DANDACHI ET AL.

Molecular characterization of beta-lactamase genes

A total of 105 Gram-negative bacilli having ESBL phe-
notypes were subjected to real-time PCR analysis for the
screening of CTX-M-, TEM-, and SHV-encoding genes.
CTX-M was detected in 83 (79%) ESBL isolates, TEM in
57 (54%), and SHV in 9 (8.5%). In total, 12 strains (11%)
showed the coexistence of the 3 bla genes together, 43
(41%) showed the coexistence of 2 bla genes, and 57 (54%)
harbored only 1 beta-lactamase gene. In addition, CMY was
the only ampC-encoding gene detected in ampC and ESBL/
ampC coproducers.

Colistin-resistant isolates: resistance proﬁles
and genotype

The detailed proﬁle of the resistance of E. coli colistin-
resistant strains isolated in this study is given in Fig. 1. To
summarize, 4 of the 23 strains were colistin resistant and
also ESBL producers, whereas the remaining strains (19
isolates) were susceptible to all beta-lactams tested, except
for ampicillin. Resistance rates toward non-beta-lactam an-
tibiotics varied: eight strains were co-resistant to gentami-
cin,
and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole,
seven strains were resistant to two non-beta-lactams, two
were resistant to only one non-beta-lactam antibiotic and
six strains were susceptible to all non-beta-lactams tested.
Colistin MICs of the 23 E. coli isolates ranged between 4
and 16 mg/mL except 1 strain having an MIC of 256 mg/mL.
Standard PCR and sequencing revealed that all the strains
were mcr-1 positive. In the four ESBL mcr-1-positive re-

ciproﬂoxacin,

sistant
isolates, CTX-M was detected in two strains,
whereas SHV and TEM were detected in all four strains
(Fig. 1).

Discussion

Antimicrobial resistance is rapidly evolving and dissem-
inating worldwide. In the context of antimicrobial resistance
in the one health concept, livestock (i.e., pigs, poultry, and
cattle) is now considered as a major reservoir of MDR or-
ganisms and antibiotic resistance genes.12 In Lebanon, few
studies have been conducted to determine the prevalence of
MDR organisms in Lebanese livestock21; however in pork,
only one study reported the detection of a carbapenemase-
producing A. baumannii isolate from a pig in northern Le-
banon.24 To the best of our knowledge, our study is the ﬁrst
in Lebanon to describe the epidemiology of beta-lactamase-
producing Gram-negative bacilli in Lebanese swine farms. It
is worth mentioning that the number of samples collected
was not relatively high because only few swine farms are
accessible in Lebanon. The role of the Ministry of Agriculture
was essential to carry out this study because it provided the
legal permission to access and sample the different sites.

In our

investigation, ESBL/ampC-producing Gram-
negative bacilli were detected in 66.5% of the collected
fecal samples (Table 1). Compared with other epidemio-
logical studies investigating pigs worldwide, the prevalence
in Lebanon is not far from what is reported in Belgium
(75%)33 and Germany (88%)34 but is still much higher than
those reported in China (32%),35 United Kingdom (23%),36

Denmark (18.5%),37 Switzerland (15%),38 and Thailand
(2.4%).39 Differences in the number of samples and
screening methodologies, in addition to the level and type of
antibiotics prescribed in the farms of each country could
explain these differences.3 The aforementioned concept
applies also to prevalence of mcr-1-positive E. coli strains
detected in our previous study (17%) compared with other
international studies: Portugal (98%),40 Vietnam (37.5%),41
China (20.6%),7 Japan (1%),42 France (0.5%)43 and United

In this study, 83% of ESBL/ampC producers were co-
resistant to at least two non-beta-lactam antibiotics with
the highest
resistance being observed against
trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole and ciproﬂoxacin. During
our samples collection, we tried hard to collect correct data
on the types and quantities of antibiotics used in the different
farms, a mission nearly impossible. Indeed, despite the of-
ﬁcial presence of the Ministry of Agriculture, the coopera-
tion of the farm owners was not easy to get, and there was
no clear distinction between different uses of antibiotic in
farms investigated (treatment of infections, prevention on
infection, and growth enhancement). Unofﬁcially, we were
informed that enroﬂoxacin is frequently administered to
pork in Lebanon. In fact, it has been reported that in pigs,
penicillins are used to treat necrotic enteritis, whereas
cephalosporins such as cefquinome and ceftiofur are pre-
scribed for polyarthritis, septicemia, polyserositis, and re-
spiratory infections.2 Use of non-beta-lactams such as
gentamicin, ﬂuoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and colistin
was also reported.45,46

the molecular level,

On the contrary, it is not clear to us to which extent
international guidelines and recommendations for hygiene
and waste management in pig farms are applied in our
country. Questionable hygiene, poor feed quality, and bad
waste management imply another important drive in the
emergence of multidrug resistance in pigs in addition to the
overuse of antibiotics that facilitates the transmission of
resistant organisms from pigs to their surrounding environ-
ment and vice versa. At
the most
commonly detected beta-lactamase gene was the CTX-M.
This gene was highly reported in Lebanon in the clinical
settings16,47 and in cattle21 and poultry.22 CTX-M is also the
main ESBL type reported globally in farm animals.36,37,39,48
As for ampC producers, this study showed that CMY was
the only ampC beta-lactamase gene detected in swine farms
in Lebanon. The same observation was also made in chicken
farms (data not given). It has been shown worldwide that
this gene is the most common ampC beta-lactamase gene
detected in poultry,49,50 food-producing animals,51,52 and
healthy pets.53,54 In this study, it has not escaped our at-
tention that no carbapenemase producers were detected.
This is in accordance with another study performed by our
group in poultry farms22 reﬂecting that carbapenemase pro-
ducers are really scarce in Lebanese livestock.

Furthermore, in this study we report for the ﬁrst time the
detection of mcr-1 in pork in Lebanon. In this country, mcr-
1 gene was ﬁrst reported in chicken during an epidemio-
logical study aiming at determining the prevalence of MDR
organisms in Lebanese chicken farms.23 The MIC values of
colistin in mcr-1-producing E. coli isolates in this study
range between 4 and 16 mg/mL. These results are in accor-
dance with other studies showing that mcr-1-harboring

isolates do not usually have elevated colistin MICs.55,56
Some reports showed that mcr-1-positive E. coli isolate
could have a colistin MIC as low as 2 mg/mL.57 In our
collection of mcr-1 strains, only one ESBL-producing
E. coli had a colistin MIC of 256 mg/mL. This elevated MIC
might be attributed to additional chromosomal mutations in
the phoP/Q, pmrA/B, and mgrB genes as reported previously
in the literature.5 However, further genomic analysis is
needed to explore this possibility. Delannoy et al. reported
the isolation of E. coli strains harboring mcr-1 and having
amino acid mutations in the phoP/Q, pmrA/B, and mgrB
genes from diseased pigs in France.57

Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that, as given in
Fig. 1, none of the colistin-resistant isolates was pandrug
resistant, but rather remained susceptible to the majority
of the tested antibiotics, except four strains that were
ESBL producers. The coexistence of mcr-1- and ESBL/
carbapenemase-encoding genes was previously reported in
several studies in the literature.58,59 Resistance proﬁles of
mcr-1 strains in this study possibly illustrate an over-
estimated fear of colistin resistance. E. coli colistin-resistant
isolates will pose therapeutic challenges only if transmission
of MDR strains to humans occurs.

In conclusion, this study describes the epidemiology of
ESBL/ampC-producing Gram-negative bacilli in Lebanese
swine farms. The emergence of mcr-1 in pigs is alarming.
The level of antibiotic consumption in Lebanese swine
farms remains unknown; a more transparent policy should
be adopted in this context. Therefore, the surveillance and
control programs addressing antibiotic consumption in Le-
banese farms, especially in pigs, are urgently needed. Future
studies should not only focus on antimicrobials usage but
also on the risk factors associated with the carriage of MDR
organisms in pigs.
