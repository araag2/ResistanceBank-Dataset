SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY 

This paper describes the characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from bulk tank and 

individual  cow  milk  in  Tunisia.  All  strains  were  genotyped  by  spa  typing  and  RS-PCR,  a 

method  based  on  the  amplification  of  the  16S-23S  rRNA  intergenic  spacer  region,  and 

multiplex PCRs for 22 virulence genes. A selected sub-sample of strains was also genotyped 

by multi-locus sequence typing. All strains were tested for antimicrobial resistance. Our study 

evidences  a  predominance  of  strains  belonging  to  Clonal  Complex  97.  Methicillin-resistant 

strains were not detected, and overall low level of antimicrobial resistance was reported. 

ABSTRACT 

Staphylococcus  aureus is a major  agent  of bovine mastitis  in dairy herds, causing economic 

losses  in  dairy  industry  worldwide.  In  addition,  milk  and  milk-products  contaminated  by 

Staph.  aureus  can  cause  harmful  human  diseases.  The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  characterize 

Staph.  aureus  strains  isolated  from  dairy  farms  in  Tunisia.  Bulk  tank  milk  (n  =  32)  and 

 

individual  cow's  milk  (n  =  130)  samples  were  collected  during  the  period  of  2013-2014.

Forty-three  S.  aureus  isolates  were  recovered  and  typed  by  spa  typing,  16S-23S  rRNA 

intergenic  spacer  (RS-PCR)  and  multiplex  PCRs  for  22  virulence  genes.  Antimicrobial 

resistance was also investigated with a disk diffusion test. A selected sub-sample of 22 strains 

was  additionally  genotyped  by  MLST.  Seventeen  spa  types  were  recovered  and  t2421  (n  = 

10),  t521  (n  =  6),  and  t2112  (n  =  5)  were  the  most  common.  Fourteen  different  RS-PCR 

genotypes grouped into 11 clusters were detected in our study, with predominance of the RVI 

genotype  (n  =  24).  Eight  sequence  types  were  identified  and  Clonal  Complex  97, 

corresponding to RS-PCR cluster R, was the most common (n = 10), followed by CC1 (n = 

4),  CC15  (n  =  3)  and  other  four  accounting  for  1  or  2  strains.  Different  combinations  of 

virulence genes were reported, and enterotoxin genes were present in few strains (seh, n = 4; 

sea, n = 2; sea and seh, n = 2; sec and sel, n = 2). The majority of strains were resistant only 

to  penicillin,  only  one  strain  was  found  to  be  multi-resistant  and  no  methicillin-resistant 

Staph.  aureus  (MRSA)  was  demonstrated.  Our  study  reported  the  isolation  of  CC97  from 

bovine  milk  in  Tunisia  for  the  first  time  and  confirmed  the  relevance  of  this  lineage  in 

intramammary infection in cows.

Staphylococcus aureus is recognized as an important pathogen for both humans and numerous 

INTRODUCTION 

animal  species.  In  dairy  herds  it  causes  clinical  and  subclinical  mastitis,  a  disease  affecting 

milk  production  industry  worldwide,  determining  important  economic  losses (Seegers  et  al., 

2003).  Spread  of  infection  in  a  farm  usually  occurs  from  cow  to  cow  during  the  milking 

process  through  contaminated  machines,  equipment,  or  milker’s  hands  (Petersson-Wolfe  et 

al., 2010). The presence of such pathogen in food producing animals or raw milk is a matter 

of  concern  for  human  health  as  enterotoxigenic  Staph.  aureus  strains  are  common  cause  of 

food intoxication worldwide due to the ingestion of preformed enterotoxins (Kadariya et al., 

2014).  Although  Staph.  aureus  belongs  to  the  commensal  bacterial  flora  of  humans  and 

animals,  it  can  become  pathogenic  through  acquisition  of  virulence  factors  that  damage  the 

host  cells.  Indeed,  Staph.  aureus  can  produce  a  wide  range  of  extracellular  toxins  and 

virulence  factors,  such  as  Panton-Valentine  leukocidin  (PVL),  toxic  shock  syndrome  toxin 

(TSST-1),  exofoliative  toxins  (such  as  ETA  and  ETB),  and  several  staphylococcal 

enterotoxins, which represent a risk for humans, being associated with severe infections (Lina 

et al., 1999; Jarraud et al., 2002). 

Staphylococcus aureus can produce not only a wide range of virulence factors, but it can also 

acquire  the  staphylococcal  cassette  chromosome  mec,  giving  rise  to  methicillin-resistant 

Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (Pantosti, 2012). MRSA is an important pathogen in human 

medicine, but can also colonize and cause infections in a variety of animal species (Pantosti, 

2012; Guardabassi et al., 2013). The frequent detection of specific livestock-associated (LA) 

MRSA  clones  (primarily  CC398)  in  farm  animals  and  personnel  attending  them  in  recent 

years in several countries is a matter of concern (de Neeling et al., 2007; Spohr et al., 2010;

Richter et al., 2012).  

Although several studies reported the prevalence and described the genetic lineages of Staph. 

aureus from healthy and hospitalized humans (Kechrid et al., 2010; Ben Slama et al., 2011) 

and  from  different  animal  species  in  Tunisia  (Gharsa  et  al.,  2012a;  Gharsa  et  al.,  2012b; 

Gharsa  et  al.,  2015),  few  data  about  prevalence  and  genotypes  of  Staph.  aureus  or  MRSA 

from dairy cattle herds in Tunisia are available. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize 

Staph.  aureus  strains  isolated  from  bovine  milk  collected  in  different  regions  of  Tunisia  by 

antimicrobial  susceptibility  testing,  genotyping  techniques  (spa  typing,  16S-23S  rRNA 

intergenic  spacer  genotyping  (RS-PCR),  multilocus  sequence  typing  (MLST))  and  virulence 

genes contents determination.

Very few data on the presence and the genetic traits of  Staph. aureus in bovine milk (either 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

from  healthy  or  diseased  cows)  in Tunisia are available.  Thus,  this  study  was  undertaken  to 

fill the gap and to determine genetic lineages and virulence traits of the collected strains. 

Amongst the 162 milk samples tested in this study, 43 Staph. aureus were recovered. Twenty 

seven (20.8%) were from individual cows originating from 11 small family farms distributed 

in  six  regions  of  Tunisia  and  16  isolates  (50%)  derived  from  bulk  tank  milk  collected  in 

various regions of the country (Table 1). Similarly, high rates of Staph. aureus occurrence in 

bovine  bulk  tank  milk  have  been  reported  worldwide  (Jørgensen  et  al.,  2005;  Miranda-

Morales et al., 2008; Francoz et al., 2012; Haran et al., 2012). 

Several molecular methods have been described for the typing of Staph. aureus isolates, such 

as  MLST,  spa  typing,  Pulsed-field  Gel  Electrophoresis  (PFGE)  or  RS-PCR,  a  genotyping 

technique  based  on  PCR  amplification  of  the  16S-23S  rRNA  intergenic  spacer  region 

developed by Fournier  and colleagues  (2008).  This  method has  been successfully applied in 

Switzerland and Italy to show the genotype’s association between virulence gene patterns and 

clinical  properties  of  Staph.  aureus  intra-mammary  infection  in  cows  (Graber  et  al.,  2009; 

Cremonesi et al., 2015).

In this study all the 43 strains were submitted to spa typing and RS-PCR. Seventeen different 

spa  types  were  detected:  t2421  (n  =  10,  23.3%);  t521  (n  =  6,  14%);  t2112  (n  =  5,  11.6%); 

t114, t254 (n = 3, 7%); t127, t4045, t4682, t5428 (n = 2, 4.7%); t084, t359, t701, t903, t1201, 

t2844,  t2883,  and  t10103  (n  =  1,  2.3%)  (Table  1).  RS-PCR  revealed  the  presence  of  14 

different  genotypes,  grouped  into  11  clusters.  RVI  genotype  was  the  most  frequent  (n  =  24, 

55.8%  of  isolates),  followed  by  RI  (n  =  4,  9.3%),  both  belonging  to  cluster  R,  while  other 

genotypes were represented by one or two strains each (Table 1). 

One among  the strains  presenting the same combination of RS-PCR/spa  type was randomly 

selected  and  typed  by  MLST,  for  a  total  of  22  strains  further  characterized.  Eight  different 

sequence types (ST) belonging to 7 clonal complexes were detected: CC97 (n = 10, 45.5%), 

including ST97 (n = 7) and ST2826 (n = 3), was the most represented, followed by CC1-ST1 

(n = 4, 18.2%), CC15-ST15 (n = 3, 13.6%), CC522-ST522 (n = 2, 9.1%), CC6-ST6, CC188-

ST188 and CC1153-ST1153 (n = 1, 4.5%) (Table 1). Interestingly, ST97 and ST2826 differ 

by just one nucleotide in pta gene (C155T). 

In  our  study  several  RS-PCR  genotypes  were  found,  but  the  cluster  R  was  most  prevalent 

(65.1%).  This  result  is  different  if  compared  with  the  European  ones,  where  recently  it  was 

shown  that  Staph.  aureus  belonging  to  RS-PCR  cluster  B  (CC8)  predominates  in  several

countries,  including  Switzerland  and  Italy (Cosandey  et  al.,  2016).  Eight  different  spa  types 

were  shown to  be associated with  cluster  R (t521, t1201,  t2112,  t2421,  t2844,  t4045,  t4682, 

t10103),  but  there is  evidence  that  all  of  them  could  belong  to  CC97.  Clonal  complex  97  is 

known  to  be  one  of  the  Staph.  aureus  lineages  associated  with  cattle,  and  especially  with 

bovine mastitis (Sung et al., 2008; Hasman et al., 2010; Hata  et  al.,  2010).  However, it was 

also described in other hosts, such as human, sheep, and pigs (Battisti et al., 2010; Shepheard 

et  al.,  2013).  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge  this  is  the  first  report  of  the  occurrence  of  the 

CC97  from  bovine  isolates  in  Tunisia.  However,  it  was  previously  described  in  a  case  of 

bacteremia in a child and in the nares of one healthy sheep (Kechrid et al. 2010; Gharsa et al., 

2012b). In the African continent CC97 was only reported in the nasal cavity of healthy pigs in 

Senegal (Lozano et al., 2016). 

Despite  the  fact  that  CC97  is  one  of  the  animal  associated  lineages  frequently  carrying  the 

mecA gene, responsible for the methicillin resistance, and it represents one of the LA-MRSA 

clones (Battisti et al., 2010; Pantosti, 2012), none of the strains belonging to cluster R-CC97 

isolates  was  here  recognized  as  MRSA.  Overall,  no  MRSA  were  found  in  our  study  and, 

except for penicillin, few antimicrobial resistances were observed. This is in agreement with 

the evidence that in African countries MRSA colonization of animals is very low (Lozano et 

al.,  2016).  However,  as  only  one  colony  per  each  positive  sample  was  examined  and  no 

selective  enrichment  was  performed,  the  presence  of  MRSA  in  some  of  them  might  have

passed unnoticed. 

Thirteen (30.2%) isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobial tested in this study, while the 

remaining  were  resistant  to  penicillin  (n  =  27,  62.8%)  or  penicillin  and  tetracycline  (n  =  2, 

4.7%). One strain (2.3%) showed a pattern of multiple resistances to penicillin, tetracycline, 

streptomycin  and  clindamycin  (Table  1).  In  animal  staphylococci,  resistance  to  penicillin, 

tetracycline,  streptomycin  and  clindamycin  are  mainly  encoded  by  blaZ,  tet(k)  or  tet(M), 

ant(6)-Ia or str, also known as aad(6) and lnuA/lnuB/lsa(B) genes, respectively (Wendlandt et 

al. 2013). Concerning vancomycin, the results of the disk diffusion test (inhibition zone > 25 

mm) does not completely exclude that some strains may had a reduced susceptibility as those 

strains can be revealed only by broth dilution or agar screen test (CLSI, 2013). 

The high  level of penicillin-resistance detected in  the present  work is in agreement with  the 

study  of  Nam  et  al.  (2011)  in  Korea  and  with  the  results  reported  form  human  isolates  in 

Tunisia (Ben Slama et al., 2011). This high level of penicillin-resistance detected in our study 

could be explained by the frequent use of this drug to treat bovine bacterial infections, but it 

can  also  be  due  to  inadequate  dosage  or  duration  of  treatment.  Overall,  the  finding  of  low

resistance rates compared to other countries (Oliver and Murinda, 2012; Li et al., 2015) could 

be explained by the low use of antibiotics in  Tunisia or could be linked to the type of dairy 

farming.  Indeed,  factors  contributing  to  spread  of  the  infection  are  high  density  of  animals, 

high  milk  production  and  animal  introduction  from  other  dairies,  while  in  the  present  study 

small family farms, which represents well the Tunisian dairy cattle reality, were investigated.  

Besides cluster R-CC97, a number of other genotypes (represented by few strains each) were 

reported  and  some  of  them  were  already  described  in  Tunisia.  Clonal  complex  1  was 

previously  observed  in  Staph.  aureus  isolates  from  donkey  nares  (Gharsa  et  al.,  2012a)  and 

from  children  patients  (Kechrid  et  al.,  2010),  while  CC6,  CC15  and  CC188  were  found  in 

nasal samples of pets (Gharsa et al., 2015). Overall, CC1 is known to be a common lineage 

among  human  isolates  (Monecke  et  al.,  2011);  however,  transmission  of  this  lineage  (CC1) 

from  animals  to  humans  is  possible  (Franco  et  al.,  2011).  CC15  is  mainly  associated  with 

human isolates, while CC6, CC188 and CC1153 are rarely reported both in human and animal 

isolates (Smith et al., 2014). Two strains belonged to CC522, a lineage mainly reported from 

goats and in less  extent from sheep (Shepheard et al., 2013). Interestingly,  these two strains 

harbored sec and sel genes, enterotoxins that usually predominate in sheep and goat isolates 

(Morandi et al., 2009), and one of them was classified as RS-PCR genotype BWII, a common 

genotype in goats (personal data), suggesting a possible transfer of strains between species. In 

different  cases  in  the  investigated  farms  small  ruminants  were  also  reared,  supporting  the

hypothesis of the inter-species transmission of the strains.  

Concerning  virulence  factors,  various  virulotypes  were  observed  (Table  1).  Different  from 

previous studies (Akineden et al., 2001; Jørgensen et al., 2005), few strains (n = 10) encoded 

for enterotoxins: only seh in four (9.3%), only sea in two (4.7%), and the combinations sea-

seh  and  sec-sel  in  two  strains  each  (4.7%).  Genes  coding  for  toxins  usually  associated  with 

human diseases, such as tst (responsible for toxic shock syndrome), eta and etb (responsible 

for the staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome), or lukS-lukF (coding for the PVL, a cytotoxin 

that causes leukocyte destruction and tissue necrosis), were rarely or never detected (tst, n = 2, 

4.7%;  eta-etb,  n  =  2,  4.7%;  lukS-lukF,  n  =  0).  Similarly,  low  rates  of  these  toxins  were 

reported either in animal or human isolates in Tunisia (Ben Slama et al., 2011). As previously 

reported,  we  observed  in  two  isolates  the  concomitant  occurrence  of  sec-sel-tst,  confirming 

their genetic linkage in the pathogenic island (SaPI2) (Orden et al., 1992). Genes encoding the 

bicomponent leucotoxin lukE-lukD were observed in all but one isolates (n = 42, 97.7%), and 

29 also harbored lukM (67.4%). The high rates of lukE-lukD and lukM found in our study are 

in  agreement  with  other  reports  (Fueyo  et  al.,  2005;  Schlotter  et  al.,  2012).  Cell-wall

Samples and bacterial isolates  

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Milk  samples  were  collected  during  the  period  of  October  2013-March  2014  from  the  bulk 

milk  tanks  of  32  farms.  Additionally,  130  milk  samples  (from  other  22  farms)  aseptically 

collected  during  controls  for  subclinical  mastitis  from  pool  of  quarters  of  individual 

apparently  healthy  cows  were  considered.  The  54  farms  investigated  in  this  study  are  small 

family  farms  (number  of  milking  cows  ranging  from  4  to  10)  distributed  in  the  areas  of 

Tunisia  where  the  majority  of  dairy  cow  herds  are  localized.  These  farms  produce  milk  for 

own consumption, for transformation to fresh cheese or for sell to milk factory. 

After collection, milk samples were chilled and transported to the laboratory and immediately 

processed.  One  hundred  microliters  of  the  samples  were  inoculated  onto  Mannitol  salt  agar 

(Bio-Rad,  Hercules,  CA,  USA)  and  incubated  for  48h  at  37°C.  From  each  positive  sample, 

one presumptive Staph. aureus colony was selected and identified by mannitol fermentation, 

Gram  staining,  catalase,  ability  to  coagulate  rabbit  plasma  (bioMérieux,  Marcy  l’Etoile, 

France),  and  DNase  activities.  Staph.  aureus  identification  was  then  confirmed  by  PCR 

targeting the nuc gene (Cremonesi et al., 2005). 

associated protein genes were detected in almost all strains (clfA-cna, n = 43, 100%; fmtB, n = 

42, 97.7%) and 22 strains (51.2%) were positive for at least one gene of the immune evasion 

cluster (IEC). This cluster encoded proteins relevant for the host immune evasion that target 

specifically  human  immune  responses  (Sung  et al.,  2008).  However  the  frequency  of  Staph. 

aureus  isolates  containing  the  scn  and  others  IEC  system  genes  is  high  (51.2%),  suggesting 

that this complex could be involved also in bovine immune response.  

In  conclusion,  our  study  reports  for  the  first  time  the  predominance  of  Staph.  aureus 

belonging to CC97 isolated from bovine milk in different areas of Tunisia, agreeing with the 

findings  reported  worldwide.  MRSA  strains  were  not  detected  in  our  collection,  and  low 

frequencies  of  antibiotics  resistance  was  reported,  except  for  penicillin.  Despite  the 

occurrence  of  low  rates  of  genes  encoding  enterotoxins,  exfoliative  toxins  and  toxic  shock 

syndrome toxin, these strains might represent a health threat to humans.  

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing  

Using  the  standard  disk  diffusion  method  in  accordance  with  the  Clinical  and  Laboratory 

Standards Institute recommendation (CLSI, 2013), antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates 

was  determined  against  (charge  in  µg/disk):  penicillin  (10),  oxacillin  (1),  cefoxitin  (30)

tetracycline (30), streptomycin (10), chloramphenicol (30), fusidic acid (10), teicoplanin (30) 

and  vancomycin  (30).  Double-disk  diffusion  test  (D-test)  with  erythromycin  (15  µg)  and 

clindamycin  (2  µg)  was  performed  on  all  isolates  to  detect inducible  clindamycin  resistance 

(Fiebelkorn et al., 2003).

spa typing was performed as described by Shopsin et al. (1999). The polymorphic X region of 

the Staphylococcal Protein A gene was amplified by PCR, and sequences data were analyzed 

using  Ridom  Staph-Type  software  (www.spaserver.ridom.de)  which  detects  spa  repeats  and 

assigns spa types. 

16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer genotyping (RS-PCR) 

The amplification of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region was performed as previously 

reported  by  Fournier  et  al.  (2008).  PCR  products  were  analyzed  by  the  miniaturized 

electrophoresis system DNA 7500 Lab Chip (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). 

This  system  separates  pieces  of  DNA  according  to  their  size  resulting  in  a  plot  of 

corresponding  peaks  (electropherogram).  Genotypes  were  defined  by  calculating  the 

corresponding Mahalanobis distance of informative peak sizes and by comparing it to those of 

the  prototype  strains  using  the  “Mahalanobis  distance  of  Staph.  aureus  genotypes”  software 

(Syring et al., 2012). 

Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) 

MLST  was  performed  as  previously  described  (Enright  et  al.,  2000)  on  one  representative 

strain  per  spa type and RS-PCR genotype (n = 22).  Allele numbers and sequence type (ST) 

were assigned by the MLST database (http://saureus.mlst.net). Clonal analysis of the STs was 

performed  using  the  clustering  algorithm  e-BURST  (http://eburst.mlst.net),  which  divides 

MLST  data  sets  into  groups  of  related  isolates  and  predicts  the  founding  genotype  of  each 

clonal complex. 

PCR for virulence factors 

All  isolates  were  tested  by  PCR  for  the  presence  of  virulence-associated  genes  applying 

primers  and  protocols  previously  described.  The  following  virulence  factors  were 

investigated: enterotoxins (from sea to see, from seg to sel; Akineden et al., 2001; Cremonesi 

et  al.,  2005),  toxic  shock  syndrome  (tst)  and  exfoliative  toxins  (eta,  etb)  (Akineden  et  al.,

2001),  PVL  (lukS-lukF;  Lina  et  al.,  1999),  leucocidin  M  (lukM)  and  leucotoxin  ED  (lukE-

lukD) (Jarraud et al., 2002). Cell-wall associated protein encoding genes clfA (clumping factor 

A; Akineden et al., 2001), cna (collagen-binding protein; Zecconi et al., 2005), and fmtB (cell-

wall  protein;  Sung  et  al.,  2008)  were  also  searched,  as  well  as  scn,  chp  and  sak  genes 

belonging to the IEC (Sung et al., 2008).
