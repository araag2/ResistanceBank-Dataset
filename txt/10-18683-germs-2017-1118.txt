Abstract 
Introduction  The  animal  husbandry  comes  to  play  an  important  role  according  to  new  economic 
reforms of the rural economy in South Asia including Sri Lanka, and the rural farming community has a 
poor  knowledge  about  hygienic  issues  of  animal  husbandry,  which  can  lead  to  spread  of  pathogenic 
bacterial strains from animals to humans. Our study was conducted to evaluate methicillin susceptible 
Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA)  colonization  and  its  antimicrobial  resistance  pattern  among  livestock 
(n=188) and related farmers (n=94) in Anuradhapura District, Sri Lanka. 

Methods S. aureus isolates were identified using mannitol salt agar, coagulase test and DNAase test. 
The  agar  plate  dilution  method  was  conducted  to  determine  the  minimum  inhibitory  concentration 
(MIC)  of  oxacillin  against  S. aureus.  Antimicrobial  susceptibility  testing  for  other  antibiotics  was 
performed  against  MRSA  isolates  using  antibiotic  containing  discs.  To  assess  the  MRSA  transmission 
from  livestock  to  humans,  we  have  grouped  MRSA  strains  according  to  antimicrobial  susceptibility 
patterns against the tested antibiotics. 

Results  Among  MRSA  isolates,  14  different  groups  with  similar  MIC  and  antibiotic  susceptibility 
patterns  were  identified.  Of  those,  2  groups  amongst  pigs  and  pig  farmers  showed  a  significant 
relationship (p=0.031). The other groups did not show any significant relationship between animals and 
the farmers. The percentages of MRSA prevalence in pigs and pig farmers were 26.6% each, in poultry 
and poultry farmers 8.3% and 13.3% respectively, in cattle and cattle farmers 8.3% and 3%. Compared 
to  human  MRSA  isolates,  animal  isolates  were  significantly  more  resistant  to  ciprofloxacin  (p=0.031), 
gentamicin 
susceptible 
Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolates were significantly more resistant to ciprofloxacin (p=0.022) and 
doxycycline (p=0.012). 

(p=0.011).  Similarly,  animal  methicillin 

(p=0.010)  and  clindamycin 

Conclusion Pig farming showed a higher prevalence and 2.4 times higher risk (OR=2.4, CI95%: 1.2-
4.8)  of  likely  transmission  of  MRSA  between  animals  and  humans  than  cattle  and  poultry  farming. 
Overall, 65% of MRSA and MSSA animal isolates were multidrug resistant.

Introduction  
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is a human pathogen 
which  can  cause  a  wide  array  of  diseases, 
including  skin  and  soft 

osteomyelitis,  infective  endocarditis,  pneumonia 
and  sepsis.  Owning 
the  emergence  of 
“superbugs”,  methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus 
aureus  (MRSA)  represents  a  global  therapeutic 

tissue

challenge  because  many  of  these  MRSA  isolates 
are multidrug resistant.1 

According  to  the  source  of  origin,  the  most 
prevalent  categories  of  MRSA  are  hospital 
acquired  MRSA  (HA-MRSA)  and  community 
acquired  MRSA  (CA-MRSA).1,2  However, 
in 
2005,  the  existence  of  a  MRSA  clone  distinct 
from  HA-MRSA  and  CA-MRSA  has  been 
reported  and  the  clone  was  observed  to  be 
associated  with  livestock,  including  pigs,  cattle, 
turkey.2  This  new  clone  was 
chicken  and 
identified  as 
livestock-associated  MRSA  (LA-
MRSA).3  LA-MRSA  differs  from  CA-MRSA, 
because it lacks the Panton Valentine Leukocidin 
(PVL) gene and has broader, variable patterns of 
antimicrobial  susceptibility.  Furthermore,  recent 
detection of a mecA homologue, designated mecC, 
was  detected  among  wild  animals  and  water 
samples with a wide geographical distribution in 
Europe.4 

animal  husbandry  for  cattle  has  been  expanded. 
The  small-scale  farming  of  poultry  and  piggery 
was  introduced to  face  the  increased  demand  of 
egg  and  meat  products.  Therefore,  the  animal 
husbandry  plays  an  important  role  in  the  rural 
economy  in  South  Asia,  including  Sri  Lanka. 
However,  the  rural  farming  community  has  a 
poor  knowledge  about  hygienic  issues  of  animal 
husbandry.11  Thus  poor  hygiene  can  lead  to 
spread  of  pathogenic  bacterial  strains  from 
animals  to  humans.12  A  French  study  has 
described  that  pig  farming  is  a  risk  factor  for 
increased  nasal  Staphylococcus  aureus  colonization 
in humans.13

healthcare  settings  and  the  community  for 
decades,  in  Sri  Lanka,  the  livestock  related 
MRSA  prevalence  has  not  been  studied  yet.15 
Hence, we conducted a study to evaluate MRSA 
and  SA  colonization  and 
its  antimicrobial 
resistance  patterns  among  livestock  and  related 
farmers in Anuradhapura District, Sri Lanka.

Study population 
This  is  a  descriptive  cross-sectional  study 
livestock 
which  was  conducted  among  the 
farming community in Anuradhapura District of 
Sri 
2017. 
Demographical  data  were  collected  using  an 
interviewer  based  questionnaire.  The  farmers 
who  were  hospitalized  within  the  previous  12 
months  or  had  used  antibiotics  within  the 
previous 30 days were excluded from the study.

After  explaining  the  procedure,  nasal  and 
axillary  swabs  were  collected  from  livestock 
farmers using moistened sterile cotton swabs. A 
total of 188 (94 nasal and 94 axillary) swabs were 
obtained  from  farmers.  Two  animals  from  each 
farm  were  randomly  selected  and  188  (62  pigs, 
64 chicks and 62 cattle) nasal or perineal or peri-

The  pattern  of  antimicrobial  susceptibility 
varies  according  to  the  degree  and  duration  of 
to  antimicrobials.5  Since 
livestock  exposure 
antimicrobials are commonly used in livestock as 
growth  promoters,  such  exposure  is  threatening 
because 
of 
antimicrobial  resistance.  If  antimicrobials  are 
used 
the 
tendency  to  develop  antimicrobial  resistance  is 
high.6 In animal gut these resistance genes can be 
horizontally 
transferred  and  animal-emerging 
antibiotic resistance genes can finally be acquired 
by  human  pathogens  by 
food 
contaminants that originate from animals and are 
consumed  or  handled  by  humans.  In  addition, 
MRSA  cross  contamination  can  occur  following 
entry 
transmission  via  healthcare 
facilities  or  spread  via  environmental  routes 
including air, water, or manure.7,8

However,  recently,  the  United  States  of 
America and some European countries including 
the  Netherlands,  Denmark  and  Norway,  have 
implemented 
to 
minimize antibiotic use in livestock.9  During the 
past decades, the food habits of the people have 
dramatically changed from plant to animal origin 
with  rising  trends  in  consumption  of  foods  of 
animal  origin  in  the  South  Asian  region.10

according  to  the  antimicrobial  susceptibility 
pattern  (ASP)  of  each  strain  against  the  tested 
antibiotics.  Strains  having  exact  similarity  in 
antimicrobial susceptibility were taken as similar, 
indicating  a  likely  cross  transmission  between 
livestock  and  humans.  Furthermore,  oxacillin 
MIC  was  also  taken  in  to  match  those  strains. 
The  data  were  double  checked  and  transported 
to  SAS  9.1  (2005,  New  Jersey,  USA)  for 
statistical  analysis.20  Demographic  data  were 
expressed as central tendency. MRSA and MSSA 
colonization  percentages  were  analyzed  using 
Chi-squared/Fisher’s  exact  test  for  statistical 
significance.  Logistic  regression  was  performed 
to assess the risk of transmission of MRSA and 
MSSA  strains  between  humans  and  livestock. 
Risk  was  expressed  as  odds  ratio  with  95% 
confidence interval.  

 
Results  
In our study cohort, males were significantly 
more engaged in livestock farming than females 
(p=0.021).  The  cattle  farmers  were  traditionally 
doing  farming  over  a  period  of  20±2.5  years 
(p=0.021) while piggery and poultry farmers were 
recently  introduced  in  farming,  and  had  been 
engaged over a period of 5±2 years.

Discussion 
The  prevalence  of  SA  has  rapidly  changed 
over last few decades over the globe, thus, novel 
data  are  needed.  In  developing  countries,  the 
demand 
is 
significantly increased because of lifestyle changes 
due  to  rapid  urbanization.  In  Sri  Lanka,  the 
production  of  poultry  products  has  been 
increased significantly during the last five years.21 
This  situation  is  quite  common  in  other  South 
Asian countries including India. In this study, we 
assessed  colonization  with  MRSA  among  Sri 
Lankan  livestock  and  related  farmers.  The  study 
showed 
the  MRSA  prevalence  among 
livestock  was  13.8%  (pigs: 25.8%,  poultry:  9.3% 
and cattle: 6.2%) which is lower when compared 
with  European  countries,  where  the  percentage 
in  Germany  and  Netherlands  was  >35%22,23  and 
in  Poland  20.6%.24  However, 
some  Asian 
countries  exhibit  lower  carriage  of  MRSA  in 
livestock as is the case in China: 11.4%,25 Korea: 
3.2%,22    Malaysia:  1.4%,24  Japan:  0.9%,29  and 
Taiwan:  14.4%.26  In  our  study,  MRSA  carriage 
among  livestock  farmers  was  15.9%  (piggery: 
25.8%  poultry:  12.5%  and  cattle:  9.6%).  Nasal 
MRSA carriage was significantly higher compared 
to  axillary  carriage.  A  French  study  in  2005 
showed nasal MSSA carriage was predominant in 
piggery 
the 
livestock  farmer’s  MRSA  carriage  also  showed 
low  prevalence  compared  to  Europe  and  the 
USA.21-26 But the Sri Lankan prevalence is higher 
than that of other Asian countries, which report 

farmers.13  Similar

 other  tested  antibiotics.  The  MRSA  strains 

having  the  same  MIC  against  oxacillin  and  a 
similar  antibiotic  sensitivity  pattern  against  the 
assayed  antibiotics  were  put  into  one  group. 
Among  MRSA  isolates,  14  groups  with  similar 
MIC  and  antibiotic  susceptibility  pattern  were 
identified.  Of  those,  2  groups  [the  MIC  >  128 

µg/mL group (χ(1)=11.4, p=0.031) and the MIC 
(χ(1)=710.4,  p=0.031)] 

=  64  µg/mL  group 
between pigs and pig farmers showed significant 
relationship 
(Table  2).  Exact  MIC  against 
oxacillin and ASP between human and livestock 
strains indicated the likely transmission between 
animals and human. The isolates from chick and 
poultry  farmers  and  from  cattle  and  cattle 
farmers  did  not  show  significant  similarities  in 
terms of antibiotic susceptibility patterns. MRSA 
isolates among 8 groups (5 human-pig; 2 human-
cattle  and  1  human-chick)  were  resistant  to 
ciprofloxacin,  clindamycin,  erythromycin  and 
gentamicin  and  all  groups  were  susceptible  to 
vancomycin,  teicoplanin,  linezolid  and  fusidic 
acid (Table 2). 

A 

significant 

similarity  of 

susceptibility 
percentages between human and animal isolates 
was observed for clindamycin, ciprofloxacin and 
gentamicin.  All  the  MRSA  and  MSSA  strains 
isolated 
to 
clindamycin  and  all  the  MRSA  isolates  were 
resistant to gentamicin and ciprofloxacin. None 
of  the  strains  isolated  from  livestock  farmers 
showed  total  resistance  (100%)  against  any  of 
the antibiotics assayed (Table 3).   

livestock  were 

from 

resistant 

Based on ASP and MIC compatibility among 
MRSA isolates, there was a 2.4 times higher risk 
of  transmission  between  pigs  to  piggery  farmers 
(OR=2.4,  95%CI:  1.2-4.8)  while  there  was  no

Western  countries.    Doxycycline  resistance  was 
almost  similar  in  human  (66.6%)  and  livestock 
MRSA  (61.5%)  isolates.  In  Sri  Lanka,  in  the 
period  prior  to  1996,  doxycycline-based  growth 
promoters  were  used  extensively  but  they  are 
currently  banned.  However, 
the  use  of 
doxycycline  needs  to  be  further  investigated  as 
the persistence  of  such  resistance  might  indicate 
continued 
sub-therapeutic 
concentrations.27,28 All isolates were susceptible to 
vancomycin,  teicoplanin  and  linezolid.  Further, 
most  of  the  MRSA  isolates  were  susceptible  to

rates  of  5.5%  in  Malaysia,23,24  13%  in  Taiwan25 

 This wide variability between West and East still 
needs  to  be  explained.  Perhaps  this  could 
correlate with the scale of farming and the use of 
antibiotics  and  antibiotic  analogues  as  feed 
additives.  In  Sri  Lanka,  use  of  sub-therapeutic 
concentrations of antimicrobials is well regulated 
and  only  the  following  are  allowed  for  use: 
bacitracin, 
and 
avilamycin.27  Further,  the  methods  deployed  for 
MRSA  sampling  and  isolation  can  also  vary 
among  studies.  In  our  study,  MSSA  carriage 
among  livestock  was  26.6%  and  24.4%  among

A  significantly  higher  prevalence  and  similar 
antibiotic  susceptibility  patterns  of  MRSA  and 
MSSA  between  pigs  and  pig 
farmers  was 
observed.  This  association  can  be  explained  as 
MRSA  and  MSSA  carriage  is  high  among  pigs, 
animals with a relatively long life span up to their 
slaughter age (6 months), and which require high 
contact  time  and  demand  a  maximum  effort  of 
handling  compared  to  chicks  (life  span  28-42 
days). When compared to cattle (with a mean life 
span of 3-5 years), pigs have shorter life spans but 
the  effort  of  handling  and  the  contact  time  is 
higher. In our cohort, another important factor is 
that pigs live in packed rooms with low mobility.

The  greater  risk  of  acquiring  MRSA  in  pig 
farming  was  also  observed  in  several  other 
countries.  The  prevalence  of  MRSA  in  the 
general community in the Netherlands is among 
the lowest in the Europe (<1%). However, MRSA 
was  isolated  in  rates  of  30-45%  among  pig 
farmers  in  the  Netherlands.  In  Denmark,  it  has 
been observed that 46% of pigs were positive for 
MRSA  harboring  the  CC398  clonal  complex. 
From a large-scale study in Germany it has been 
found  that  70%  of  swine  farms  are  positive  for 
MRSA.31 In the Asian region, Malaysia exhibits a 
MRSA  prevalence  of  1.38%  among  pigs  and 
5.5%  among  pig  farmers.32  In  the  USA,  the 
percentages are 49% among pigs and 45% among 
pig  related  workers.33  Japan  has  reported  the 
presence  of  livestock  associated  gene  segments 
(ST398, ST9, ST5, ST97 and ST705) among pig 
farmers.34 

The  lack  of  typing  data  is a  drawback  of  our 
study.  Compared  to  genotyping  and  multilocus 
sequence  typing,  antibiogram  based  phenotypic 
methods  have  a  low  sensitivity  and  specificity.35 
Therefore,  genotypic  comparisons  would  have 
ensured  a  stronger  relationship  for  data  on 
human  and  livestock  transmission  compared  to 
the one reported in our current results. 

MRSA  and  SA  are  suitable  for  phenotyping 
since  they  are  metabolically  diverse  within  their 
species.35  However,  the  data  presented  about 
antibiotic susceptibility patterns and colonization 
patterns 
and 
transmission  of  MRSA  in  pig  farming  could  be 
significant in Sri Lanka.

Conclusions   
Pig  farming  showed  a  higher  prevalence  and 
2.4  times  higher  risk  of  likely  transmission  of 
MRSA between animals and humans than cattle 
and poultry farming. Overall, 65% of MRSA and 
MSSA  animal  isolates  were  multidrug  resistant. 
The  use  of  doxycycline  needs  to  be  further 
investigated  as  the  persistence  of  such  resistance 
might  indicate  continued  use  in  sub-therapeutic 
concentrations.  Furthermore,  health  education 
related to hygienic measures in livestock needs to 
be performed regularly.
