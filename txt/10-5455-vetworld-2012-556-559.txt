Abstract

Aim: To study the incidence of S.enteritidis in poultry and meat samples by cultural and PCR methods. 
Materials and Methods: A total of 130 samples (25 each of chicken, mutton, poultry faeces, cloacal samples and 10 each of 
liver, spleen and kidney) collected from different sources were subjected to cultural and PCR methods for the presence of 
Salmonella  and  Salmonella  enteritidis.  Primers  for  invA  and  sefA  gene  were  used  for  Salmonella  and  S.enteritidis 
respectively. 
Results: Out of 130 samples, 87 were positive for Salmonella spp. i.e. chicken-16(64%), mutton-12(48%), faeces-23(92%), 
cloacal swabs-23(92%), liver-5(50%), spleen and kidney samples-4(40%) each by PCR methods, whereas 77 were positive 
by cultural method i.e. chicken-14(56%), mutton-10(40%), faeces-22(88%), cloacal swabs-21(84%), liver-4(40%), spleen 
and kidney-3(30% each). Out of 87 positive for Salmonella by PCR method, 59(chicken-12, mutton-7, faeces-17, cloacal 
swabs-15, liver-3, spleen-2, kidney-3) were positive for S.enteritidis. High incidence of S.enteritidis (68%) in all the above 
samples are indicative of unhygienic conditions in poultry farms. Selective enrichment with Rappaport-Vassilidias (RV) 
broths and Tetrathionate (TT) broths were superior over Selenite-F (SF) and Selenite cysteine (SC) broths.
Conclusions: High incidence of S.enteritidis was seen in most of poultry samples like chicken, kidney, liver and it's faeces 
than mutton, which was indicative of contamination of S.enteritidis is more prevalent in poultry farms.

Materials and Methods

In  this  study  PCR  method  was  used  to  detect  Type  Culture  Collection  (MTCC),  Chandigarh  was 
used as known positive strain in PCR analysis. About 
1.5  ml  of  enriched  broths  were  taken  in  eppendorf 
tubes and bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 
8000  rpm  for  10  min  and  the  supernatant  was 
discarded. Fifty µl of sterile distilled water was added 
A  total  of  130  different  mutton  and  chicken 
related samples (25 samples each of mutton, chicken

samples were used as templates for PCR analysis.
The samples were collected in the sterile containers 
Bacterial DNA amplification was done in 20 µl 
and transferred under cold conditions (with icepack) 
reaction  mixture  containing  2  µl  of  10x  Taq  DNA 
to the lab. Mutton, Chicken meat and chicken internal 
polymerase buffer containing 100 mM tris with p  9.0, 
organs (10 g) samples were preenriched in 90 ml of 
500 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl  and 1% triton X-100), 2

S.enteritidis in chicken might be due to not following 
hygienic  methods  in  rearing,  slaughtering  and 

Out of 25 mutton samples, 10(40%) and 12 (48%)
 were positive for Salmonella by cultural method and 
PCR  methods.  Out  of  12  PCR  positives,  7  were 
positive for S. enteritidis by PCR, which accounts to 
28  and  58.3%  over  total  number  of  samples  and 
positive samples for Salmonella by PCR respectively. 
High  incidence  of  Salmonella  in  meat  (96.7%)  by 
cultural  method  than  the  present  study  (40%)  was 
reported  by  Malkawi  and  Gharaibeh,  [22]  and  low 
incidence  (0,  1.5,  6.3,  11.4  and  20%)  reported  by 
Duffy et. al. [25], Scanga et. al. [26], Stock and Stolle 
[27], Heredia et. al. [28] and Hassanien et. al. [16] 
respectively. The incidence of S.enteritidis in mutton 
samples by PCR method in this study (48%) is similar 
to  the  incidence  (47.3%)  reported  by  Malkawi  and

positive  for  Salmonella  by  cultural  method  and 
16(64%)  by  PCR  method  (Fig.  1).  Out  of  16  PCR 
positives, 12 were positive for S.enteritidis by PCR 
(Fig.  2)  which  accounts  to  48  and  75%  over  total 
number  of 
  samples  and  positive  samples  for 
Salmonella by PCR respectively (results are shown in 
Table:3). Similar results were reported by Hassanien 
et. al. [16]. Low incidence of Salmonella in chicken 
meat than the present study (56%) by cultural method 
i.e. 40%, 26.3%, 18% and 6.79% were reported by 
Tavechio, [17]; Plummer et. al. [18]; Cortez et. al. [19] 
and Amini et. al. [20] respectively, whereas Blivet et. 
al.  [21]  reported  higher  incidence  (97.6%).  The 
incidence of Salmonella by PCR method in the present 
study (64%) was similar to the findings of Malkawi 
and  Gharraibeh  [22]  and  higher  than  the  incidence 
(36.5%)  reported  by  Uyttendaele  et.  al.  [23].  The  Gharraibeh [22].
incidence of S.enteritidis in the present study (75%) by 
PCR was less than the incidence (90%) reported by 
Wang et. al. [24] and higher than the incidence (5.6% 
and 8%) reported by Cortez et. al. [19] and Hassanien 
et. al. [16]  respectively. 

The  high  incidence  of  Salmonella  spp.  and 

The  unhygienic  slaughtering  methods  and 
unhygienic environment in the sale shops of mutton might 
be the reasons for higher incidence of salmonellosis.

Out of 25 poutry faecal samples, 22(88%) were 
positive  for  Salmonella  by  cultural  method  and 
23(92%) by PCR method. Out of 23 PCR positives, 17

faeces  than  mutton,  which  was  indicative  of 
contamination  of  S.enteritidis  is  more  prevalent  in 
poultry farms. Based on high incidence of Salmonella 
and S.enteritidis in mutton and poultry related samples 
in and around Hyderabad, strict hygienic and sanitary 
procedures  in  rearing  of  livestock  and  poultry, 
slaughtering and marketing of these products should 
be practiced.

Study on the incidence of Salmonella enteritidis in poultry and meat samples by cultural and PCR methods
were  positive  for  S.  enteritidis  by  PCR,  which 
accounts 68 and 73.9% over total number of samples 
and  positive  samples  for  Salmonella  by  PCR 
respectively.  Low  incidence  (6.9%  and  50%)  of 
Salmonella in poultry faeces by cultural method were 
reported by Amini et. al. [20] and Mirmomeni et. al. 
[29] respectively than the present study (88%). The 
incidence of Salmonella (92%) in this study by PCR 
method is much higher than the incidence (1.8% and  Author’s contribution
66%) reported by Tamuly et. al. [30] and Carli et. al. 
[31]  respectively.  The  incidence  (73.91)  of  S.  TMR participated in the preparation of experimental

Out of 10 chicken liver samples, 4(40%) were 
positive  for  Salmonella  by  cultural  method  and 
5(50%) by PCR method. Out of 5 PCR positives, 3 
were positive for S.enteritidis by PCR, which accounts 
to 60% over positive samples for Salmonella by PCR. 
The incidence of Salmonella was similar in spleen and 
kidney at 30% and 40% by cultural and PCR methods 
respectively. The incidence of S.enteritidis in spleen 
and  kidney  was  50%  and  75%  respectively  over 
Salmonella positive samples. Mirmomeni et. al. [29] 
reported that the incidence of Salmonella in chicken 
liver and spleen were 20% and 17% respectively by 
cultural method and the incidence of S.enteritidis was 
90% and 73% over Salmonella positive samples.
Conclusion

High incidence of S.enteritidis was seen in most 
of poultry samples like chicken, kidney, liver and it's
