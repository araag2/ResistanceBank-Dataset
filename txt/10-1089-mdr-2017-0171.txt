in Escherichia coli Isolates from Retail Raw Ground Beef:

First Report of CTX-M-24 and CTX-M-32 in Algeria

Nesrine Rebbah,1 Yamina Messai,1 Pierre Chaˆ tre,2 Marisa Haenni,2 Jean Yves Madec,2 and Rabah Bakour1

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and molecular features of extended-spectrum cepha-
losporin resistance in Escherichia coli isolates contaminating ground beef at retail in Algeria. Of 371 ground
beef samples, 27.5% were found to contain cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates distributed into A (24.5%), B1
(60.8%), and D (14.7%) phylogroups. A rate of 88.2% of isolates had a multidrug-resistance phenotype. All
strains were producers of CTX-M type extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs): CTX-M-1, CTX-M-3, CTX-
M-14, CTX-M-15, CTX-M-24, or CTX-M-32. Conjugation assays allowed the transfer of blaCTX-M-1 in as-
sociation with IncI1 plasmids, blaCTX-M-15 with IncI1 and IncK+B/O plasmids, blaCTX-M-3 with IncK plasmids,
and blaCTX-M-14 with IncF1B or IncK plasmids. Sequence analysis of gyrA and parC genes showed mutations in
98.6% of ciproﬂoxacin-resistant isolates. The patterns ‘‘GyrA: S83L+D87N, ParC: S80I’’ (46.5%) and ‘‘ParC:
S80I’’ (42.3%) were predominant. qnrS1, qnrB, and aac(6¢)-Ib-cr were detected in 18.7% of isolates. The tet
genes, tetA, tetB, and tetA+tetB, were present in 95.7% of tetracycline-resistant isolates. The sul genes (sul1,
sul2, sul3, sul1+sul2, sul2+sul3, and sul1+sul3) and the dfr gene clusters (dfrA1, dfrA5, dfrA7, dfrA8, dfrA12,
dfrA5+dfrA12, dfrA1+dfrA5, dfrA7+dfrA12, dfrA5+dfrA7, and dfrA1+dfrA5+dfrA7) were found in 96.4% and
85.5% of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim-resistant isolates, respectively. Classes 1 and 2 integrons were de-
tected in 67.6% and 9.8% of isolates, respectively. This study highlighted the signiﬁcant presence of resistance
genes, in particular those of CTXM ESBLs, in the beef meat, with the risk of their transmission to humans
through food chain.

Introduction

A ntibiotic resistance in bacteria has reached alarm-

ing levels worldwide in both hospitals and the community,
resulting in frequent treatment failures. This is inherent in in-
discriminate use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medi-
cine and in agriculture, which provides selection pressure and in
turn promotes horizontal genetic exchange and recombination
events resulting in the emergence and spread of antibiotic re-
sistance mechanisms. Extended-Spectrum b-Lactamase (ESBL)
production is the main mechanism for b-lactam resistance
in Enterobacteriaceae.1,2 These plasmid-mediated serine en-
zymes inactivate all penicillins and cephalosporins and az-
treonam, but not cephamycins and carbapenems, and are
inhibited by clavulanic acid.3

Originally, ESBLs were derived by point mutations from
TEM-1, TEM-2, and SHV-1 penicillinases; thereafter, sub-

sequent to the introduction of extended-spectrum cephalo-
sporins (ESC) in the 1980s, new ESBLs have emerged, of
which CTX-M is now the most prevalent and widely dis-
tributed in the world.4 ESBL CTX-M would have as origin
chromosomal b-lactamases of various species of Kluyvera
and are divided into six phyla (CTX-M-1, CTX-M-2, CTX-
M-8, CTX-M-9, CTX-M-25, and CTX-M-45) on the basis
of their amino acid sequences.

Dominant variants of CTX-M differ between countries,
with the exception of the common worldwide alleles CTX-
M-15 and CTX-M-14.4 The association of blaCTX-M genes
with mobile genetic elements, epidemic plasmids, and suc-
cessful clones ensured them a rapid and wide dissemination
that changed the epidemiology of antibiotic resistance
worldwide.1,2,4 Furthermore, their association with resis-
tance to other classes of antibiotics (ﬂuoroquinolones, ami-
noglycosides, and co-trimoxazole), due to common genetic

platforms or resistance mechanisms, signiﬁcantly restricts
therapeutic possibilities.2,5 Among ESBL-producing Entero-
bacteriaceae, in particular CTX-M, Escherichia coli is the
most prevalent in the world, followed by Klebsiella pneu-
moniae.4 Agriculture animals, especially poultry and cattle,
are recognized as important vectors of ESBL carriers E. coli,
in particular CTX-M,6–8 and contaminated meat is thought to
be a possible vehicle, among others, for their transmission to
humans through consumption or handling.7

Many studies have been conducted worldwide on the
occurrence and epidemiology of acquired resistance to ESCs
in food-producing animals and food, while very little is
known about the situation in North Africa, especially Al-
geria, where there are no data on this issue. The objective of
this study was to investigate prevalence and molecular
features of ESC resistance in E. coli isolates recovered from
ground beef samples collected from butcher shops in dif-
ferent districts of Algiers.

Materials and Methods

Sampling, bacterial isolation, and identiﬁcation

A total of 371 samples of fresh ground beef were col-
lected during 2013–2014 from 230 butcheries of 20 different
districts of Algiers (Algeria), some of which are several
kilometers apart (up to 25 km). One sample or two samples
(at an interval of several days) were taken, respectively, from
89 and 141 butcheries. The latter were more important in
terms of commercial activity; the amount of processed meat
exceeds 100 kg per day, up to one animal.

The samples were taken using sterile spatula and plastic
bags and transferred to the laboratory in a cooler with ice packs
within a maximum of 4 hr. Twenty-ﬁve grams of ground meat
aseptically weighed was suspended and homogenized in pep-
tone water and incubated at 37°C overnight.9 Homogenates
were plated onto Hektoen agar plates supplemented with ce-
fotaxime at a concentration of 2 mg/L and incubated for 24 hr
at 37°C. Isolates with cultural characteristics of E. coli were
identiﬁed using standard microbiological techniques, API20E
system (bioMe´rieux, Marcy l’E´ toile, France) and polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), for detection of iudA gene encoding b-
glucuronidase.10 One E. coli isolate per sample was retained
for further analysis.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and phenotypic
detection of ESBLs

Isolates were subjected to susceptibility testing for 16 an-
tibiotics by the disc diffusion method according to the
guidelines of the antibiogram committee of the French So-
ciety for Microbiology (CASFM) (www.sfm-microbiologie.
org). The following disks of antibiotics (Bio-Rad, Marnes la
Coquette, France) were used (mg/disk): amoxicillin/clavulanic
acid (AMC) (20 mg/10 mg), cefoxitin (FOX) (30 mg), cefotax-
ime (CTX) (30 mg), ceftazidime (CAZ) (30 mg), cefpirome
(CPO) (30 mg), imipenem (IMP) (10 mg), nalidixic acid (NA)
(30 mg), ciproﬂoxacin (CIP) (5 mg), peﬂoxacin (PEF) (5 mg),
oﬂoxacin (OFX) (5 mg), tetracycline (TE) (30 IU), kanamycin
(K) (30 IU), gentamicin (GM) (15 mg), amikacin (AN) (30 mg),
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SXT) (23.75/1.25 mg), and
colistin (CS) (50 mg). E. coli ATCC 25922 was used as a control
strain. An isolate is classiﬁed as multidrug resistant (MDR)

when it exhibits resistance to antibiotics of at least three dif-
ferent classes.

The screening of isolates for ESBL production was per-

formed by the Double-Disc Synergy Test (DDST).11

The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefo-
taxime, ceftazidime, ciproﬂoxacin, tetracycline, and SXT
were determined by the agar dilution method according to
the guidelines of CASFM.

Clonality and phylogrouping of the isolates

Genetic relatedness between isolates was analyzed by
pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) after total chromosomal
DNA digestion with XbaI as previously described.12 Phyloge-
netic grouping was performed using the PCR-based method.13

Molecular detection of antibiotic resistance genes,
ISEcp1 sequence, and integrons

The DNA template for PCR was extracted by the boiling
method.14 Simplex and multiplex PCR were used to detect
the presence of the following resistance genes as previously
described: class A b-lactamases: blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M
15;
plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) deter-
minants: qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, qnrC, qnrD, qepA, oqxA, and
oqxB16,17; aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme: aac(6¢)-Ib16;
tetracycline efﬂux pumps: tetA and tetB; dihydropteroate
synthases: sul1, sul2, and sul3; and dihydrofolate reductase
gene clusters: dfrA1, dfrA5, dfrA7, dfrA8, and dfrA12.18

PCR-obtained products were sequenced as previously
described19 and analyzed with the BLAST and FASTA
programs of the National Center for Biotechnology In-
formation (www.ncbi.nlm.nhi.gov).

Ampliﬁcation of quinolone-resistance determining re-
gions (QRDR) of gyrA and parC genes was performed by
PCR20 on quinolone-resistant isolates, and the nucleotide
sequences and the deduced amino acid of ampliﬁed frag-
ments were compared with those previously reported for
gyrA (GenBank accession no. X06373) and parC (M58408)
using the online ClustalW2 sequence alignment program.

The association of blaCTX-M genes with insertion sequence

ISEcp1 was sought by PCR as already described.15,21

The presence of class 1 and class 2 integrons was sear-
ched by PCR, targeting intI1 (integrase), sul1 (sulfonamide
resistance), and qacED1 (quaternary ammonium resistance)
genes for the class 1 and int2 gene for the class 2.18

Conjugation experiments and plasmid analysis

Mating experiments were carried out on all isolates using
sodium azide–resistant E. coli BM21 as a recipient. Brieﬂy,
exponential culture of donor isolate (1 volume) and recipient
(2 volumes) was inoculated as a spot on Brain Heart Infu-
sion Agar. After overnight incubation at 37°C, transconju-
gants were selected on Mueller Hinton agar supplemented
with cefotaxime (4 mg/L) and sodium azide (200 mg/L).

Plasmid DNA was extracted by alkaline lysis method22
and analyzed by electrophoresis on 0.7% (wt/vol) agarose
gels at 5 volts/cm.

Plasmid incompatibility groups were determined by the

PCR replicon-typing method.23

Statistical analysis

For comparison of rates, Fisher’s exact test was used; a
p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results

Of 371 ground beef samples, 102 (27.5%) were found to
contain cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates; phylogenetic
analysis showed their distribution into A (n = 25, 24.5%), B1
(n = 62, 60.8%), and D (n = 15, 14.7%) phylogroups. In
particular, phylogroup B2 was not present in this collection.
Besides resistance to cefotaxime, antibiotic susceptibility
testing showed a marked resistance to tetracycline (92.2%),
cefpirome (85.3%), nalidixic acid (82.4%), oﬂoxacin (80.4%),
peﬂoxacin (72.6%), and ciproﬂoxacin (70.6%), followed by
SXT (53.9%), kanamycin (30.4%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid
(27.5%), and ceftazidime (21.6%), while low resistance rates
were observed for cefoxitin (3.9%) and gentamicin (2.9%). All
isolates were susceptible to imipenem, amikacin, and colistin
(Table 1).

Agar dilution MICs ranged from 64 to >512 mg/L for
cefotaxime, 16 to 128 mg/L for ceftazidime, 2 to >64 mg/L
for ciproﬂoxacin, ‡1216/64 mg/L for sulfamethoxazole–
trimethoprim, 64–256 mg/L for gentamicin, and 256–>512 mg/L
for tetracycline. The combinations of resistance phenotypes
allowed to distinguish 46 antibiotic resistance patterns, in-
cluding 3–11 antibiotics, and 88.2% of isolates had a MDR
phenotype, they resist to at least three antibiotic classes
(Table 2).

All isolates were positive for the DDST presumptive of
ESBL production. PCR detection showed blaCTX-M genes in
all isolates, 74 (72.5%) of CTX-M-1 group and 28 (27.5%)
of CTX-M-9 group. A rate of 47.3% of CTX-M-1 group–
producing isolates belonged to B1 phylogroup, 32.4% to

A, and 20.3% to D. For CTX-M-9 group–producing isolates,
96.4% belonged to B1 and 3.6% to A.

Sequencing analysis revealed six different blaCTX-M al-
leles as follows: blaCTX-M-1 (n = 47, 46%), blaCTX-M-15
(n = 24, 23.5%), blaCTX-M-3 (n = 2, 2%), and blaCTX-M-32
(n = 1, 1%) among the 74 CTX-M-1 group genes and
blaCTX-M-14 (n = 27, 26.5%) and blaCTX-M-24 (n = 1, 1%)
among the 28 CTX-M-9 group genes (Tables 2 and 3). The
distribution of blaCTX-M genes according to phylogroups
showed a perfect positive association (100%) between
blaCTX-M-14 and the phylogroup B1 ( p < 0.0001) and a
negative association between blaCTX-M-15 and the phy-
logroups A ( p = 0.002) and B1 ( p = 0.0005) (Table 3).

The blaTEM-1 gene resulting in production of narrow
spectrum b-lactamase was detected in 39 isolates (38.2%) in
association with all CTX-M variants (Tables 2 and 3).

The ISEcp1 insertion sequence was found upstream of all
blaCTX-M genes with a spacer region of 48 bp (W sequence)
for blaCTX-M-15 (n = 24) and blaCTX-M-1 (n = 26), 45 bp for
blaCTX-M-3 (n = 2) similar to W sequence with only one
nucleotide substitution, and 79 bp to 82 bp (sequences X +
W) for blaCTX-M-1 (n = 20) and blaCTX-M-32 (n = 1). In two
isolates harboring blaCTX-M-1 and blaCTX-M-32, ISEcp1B was
found disrupted by an ISKpn26 insertion sequence (IS5
family).

Conjugation assays performed on all isolates allowed the
transfer of blaCTX-M-1 (n = 20), blaCTX-M-15 (n = 4), blaCTX-M-3
(n = 2), and blaCTX-M-14 (n = 1) genes to E. coli BM21. Plasmid
replicon analysis showed the association of blaCTX-M-1 with
IncI1 plasmids of about 128 kb, blaCTX-M-15 with IncI1 and
IncK+B/O plasmids of about 128 kb and 80 kb, blaCTX-M-3
with IncK plasmids of about 95 kb, and blaCTX-M-14 with
IncF1B or IncK plasmids of about 150 and 48 kb, respectively
(Table 4).

The screening for PMQR determinants of all isolates
showed the presence of qnrS1, qnrB, and aac(6¢)-Ib-cr in
16 (15.7%), 1 (1%), and 2 (2%) isolates, respectively
(Tables 2 and 3), while qnrA, qnrC, qnrD, qepA, oqxA, and
oqxB were absent. It should be noted the presence of qnrS1
(n = 6) and qnrB (n = 1) genes in quinolone susceptible
isolates. qnrS1 gene was cotransferred with blaCTX-M-15
from one isolate (Table 4). Sequence analysis of the
QRDR of gyrA and parC genes showed mutations in 71/72
ciproﬂoxacin-resistant isolates (98.6%), while no muta-
tions were observed in peﬂoxacin- and/or oﬂoxacin-
resistant
isolates. The amino acid substitution pattern
‘‘GyrA: S83L+D87N, ParC: S80I’’ (46.5%) and the single
substitution ‘‘ParC: S80I’’ (42.3%) were predominant,
followed by the mutation patterns ‘‘GyrA: S83L+D87Y,
‘‘GyrA: S83L+D87N, ParC:
ParC: S80I’’
S80I+E84G’’ (2.8%), ‘‘GyrA: S83A+D87Y, ParC: S80I’’
(1.4%),
(1.4%),
‘‘GyrA: S83I, ParC: S80R’’ (1.4%), and the single muta-
tion ‘‘ParC: E84K’’ (1.4%) (Table 2).

(2.8%),

Among the 94 tetracycline-resistant strains,

tet genes
were detected in 90 isolates (95.7%), with a prevalence of
81.1% (n = 73) for tetA, 8.9% (n = 8) for tetB, and 10%
(n = 9) for tetA+tetB (Tables 2 and 3). tetA gene was co-
transferred with blaCTX-M-1 and blaCTX-M-15 from 14 and 2
isolates, respectively (Table 4).

The sul genes were present in 53 of 55 SXT-resistant
isolates (96.4%), the rates of sul1, sul2, sul3, sul1+sul2,
sul2+sul3, and sul1+sul3 were of 9.4% (n = 5), 39.6%
(n = 21), 18.9% (n = 10), 20.8% (n = 11), 7.5% (n = 4), and
3.8% (n = 2), respectively (Tables 2 and 3). sul2 gene was

cotransferred with blaCTX-M-15 and blaCTX-M-1 from six and
one isolates, respectively, and sul3 with blaCTX-M-15 from
one isolate (Table 4).

In total, 47 of 55 (85.5%) SXT-resistant isolates harbored
dfr genes. The gene clusters dfrA1, dfrA5, dfrA7, dfrA8, and
dfrA12 were detected in 14.9% (n = 7), 14.9% (n = 7), 17%
(n = 8), 4.3% (n = 2), and 27.7% (n = 13) of isolates, re-
spectively. The concomitant presence of dfrA5+dfrA12,
dfrA1+dfrA5, dfrA7+dfrA12, dfrA5+dfrA7, and dfrA1+
dfrA5+ dfrA7 was observed in 6.4% (n = 3), 4.3% (n = 2),
4.3% (n = 2), 4.3% (n = 2), and 2.1% (n = 1) of isolates, re-
spectively (Tables 2 and 3). The association sul+dfr was
found in 83.6% of SXT-resistant isolates. dfrA7 gene clus-
ter was cotransferred with blaCTX-M-1 from three isolates
and dfrA5 with blaCTX-M-15 or blaCTX-M-1 from one isolate
(Table 4).

Class 1 and class 2 integrons were detected in 69 (67.6%)
and 10 (9.8%) isolates, respectively, while class three in-
tegrons were absent. Fifty-one (73.9%) of class 1 integrons
lacked the 3¢-conserved sequence (3¢-CS) comprising the
qacED1-sul1 genes. Class 1 integrons were cotransferred
with blaCTX-M-15 and with blaCTX-M-1 from two and three
isolates, respectively (Tables 2 and 3).

The clonal relationship between 94 isolates investigated
by PFGE revealed 72 DNA proﬁles. Similarities between
proﬁles were observed within 33 isolates mostly originating
from different districts, they are divided into 10 clusters of 2
isolates and two clusters of 6 isolates (PFGE proﬁle P15)
and 7 isolates (PFGE proﬁle P27) (Table 2). The latter
harbored CTX-M-14 and belonged to phylogroup B1. As
regards resistance proﬁles, the six-isolate cluster had a same

Discussion

In this study, we investigated the prevalence and mo-
lecular features of resistance to ESC in E. coli recovered
from ground beef samples at retail in Algeria. A total of
102/371 (27.5%) ground beef samples were found to
contain ESBL-producing cefotaxime-resistant E. coli. The
occurrence of ESBL-carrying E. coli in beef varies among
countries, and comparisons are difﬁcult because of the
variety of methods used in studies; rates of 59%, 26%, 7%,
0%, and 0% were reported in studies from Spain, Tunisia,
Turkey, Switzerland, and Czech Republic,
respective-
ly.10,24–27 The
contamination of meat with ESBL-
producing E. coli may have resulted from their fecal
carriage by animals exposed to antibiotics for prophylaxy
and growth promotion.28,29

Phylogenetic grouping of isolates showed that B1 was the
main phylogroup followed by phylogroup A and to a lesser
extent by D. This ﬁnding matches with what was observed in
CTX-M–producing E. coli from livestock (including cat-
tle).8,30 Thus, even though other hypotheses may include
cross-contamination of human origin through the handling of
the beef samples before getting at retail, those phylogroups,
and particularly the absence of phylogroup B2 which is
prevalent in humans, rather argue for an animal origin.

Besides beta-lactam resistance, high prevalence resis-
tance toward ﬂuoroquinolone, SXT, and tetracycline and to
a lesser extent to kanamycin was observed, and 88.2% of the
isolates were MDR phenotype; this may have resulted from
co-selection with ESBL due to associated chromosomally-
or plasmid-encoded resistance mechanisms.5,8,24

All ESBLs detected in this study were members of CTX-
M family, in accordance with the worldwide prevalence
of CTX-Ms in Enterobacteriaceae, particularly E. coli.4

M-1 (46%), CTX-M-14 (24.5%), and CTX-M-15 (23.5%)
were largely predominant; this is consistent with the fre-
quent detection of CTX-M-1 and CTX-M-14 variants in
food-producing animals and foods.6,7,10,24,25,30 Of note,
cattle are the animal group, compared to others, where CTX-
M-15 has been recognized at a signiﬁcant prevalence.8,31,32
Therefore, it may not be surprising to ﬁnd CTX-M-15 pro-
ducers in those meat samples as they originate from beef,
and this also constitutes an argument that this colonization
may rather originate from the animal sector. The most CTX-
M variants detected up until now in Algeria were of CTX-
M-1 group; these are CTX-M-3 and CTX-M-28 in clinical
isolates,15,33 CTX-M-15 in clinical and chicken isolates,15,34
and CTX-M-1 in chicken isolates.35 The second group de-
scribed was CTX-M-9 through only the CTX-M-14 vari-
ant.36 CTX-M-24 of CTX-M-9 group and CTX-M-32 of
CTX-M-1 group found in our isolates are therefore reported
for the ﬁrst time in Algeria. These ﬁndings are indicative of
the potential role of cattle and beef meat in the dissemina-
tion of CTX-M ESBLs, particularly those of CTX-M-9
group, which up until now are rare in clinical setting in
Algeria. The association of blaTEM-1 with blaCTX-M is very
common; they often coexist on the same plasmids.15

The described associations between CTX-M variants and
phylogroups vary according to studies, depending on strains and
their origin8,30,37; it was reported that the emergence of a type of
ESBL results from its interaction with the genetic background of
the strain and the surrounding selection pressure.38 In this study,
CTX-M-14 was 100% associated with phylogroup B1; this ge-
notype seems well established in beef; it certainly contributes in
the spread of resistance through food chain.

All blaCTX-M genes were found ﬂanked upstream by an
ISEcp1B insertion sequence known to be involved in the
expression and mobility of these genes21; this association at
high rate is well documented.4 The sequences of spacer
regions between ISEcp1B and blaCTX-M of group 1 previ-
ously found in clinical and environmental Algerian strains
were W and V + W15,20; this is the ﬁrst time that X + W and
the 45-bp sequences were described in Algeria, while they
were previously reported in other countries.10,39,40 This
ﬁnding suggests a foreign origin of at least some of our
strains, possibly carried by imported animals. In two isolates
harboring blaCTX-M-1 or blaCTX-M-32, ISKpn26, ﬁrst de-
scribed in Klebsiella pneumoniae (GenBank: NC_016845),
was localized inside ISEcp1B; such a genetic environment
was already reported in E. coli (GenBank: AB976580).

Plasmid replicon analysis showed that all

The conjugation transfer of blaCTX-M genes was positive
for only 26.5% of our isolates, when plasmid horizontal
transfer is known as an important contributor in the epide-
miology of these genes1,2,4; in this regard, transfer rates of
86% and 100% of blaCTX-M gene were reported.41,42 Our
result could be explained by a chromosomal localization of
blaCTX-M genes4 or a very low transfer frequency of plasmids.
transferred
blaCTX-M-1 were associated with IncI1 plasmid group, which is
among the main groups involved in the spread of blaCTX-M.1,4,6
Many studies reported a close association between CTX-M-1
and IncI1 plasmid types in human, animal, food, and envi-
ronmental isolates, and the emergence of plasmid IncI1/
blaCTX-M-1 was ﬁrst observed in animals and subsequently in
humans.1,6,7,42,43 Our results support the role of IncI1 plas-
mids in the dissemination of blaCTX-M-1 and the food chain

in their transmission to humans. IncI1 plasmids are con-
sidered to be epidemic resistance plasmids; their successful
dissemination is probably related, among others, to plasmid-
intrinsic factors such as addiction systems (e.g., pndAC and
relBE systems) and colonization factors (e.g.,
type IV
pili).1,44 blaCTX-M-15 was found associated with IncI1 and
IncK+B/O plasmids; the association CTX-M-15-IncI1 was
already described, especially in an outbreak of E. coli
O104:H4 in Northern Europe,6 whereas linkage of CTX-M-
15 with a multireplicon plasmid IncK-B/O is reported for
the ﬁrst time in this study. The multireplicon plasmids have
advantage of being stable even in the presence of a second
plasmid carrying a homologous replicon. blaCTX-M-14 was
found associated either with IncF1B or IncK plasmids; a
close association between blaCTX-M-14 and IncK plasmids
was previously documented in different studies; indeed, this
plasmid type was described as being behind the diffusion of
CTX-M-14 among animals and humans from different Eu-
ropean countries.1,6,7,37 blaCTX-M-3, described as dominantly
harbored by IncL/M and IncI1, is reported for the ﬁrst time
on an IncK plasmid in this study.

A rate of 80.4% of the isolates was resistant to ﬂuoro-
quinolones,
the association between ESBLs, especially
CTX-M, and ﬂuoroquinolone resistance was commonly re-
ported.2,7 A rate of 18.6% of isolates harbored PMQR de-
terminants with a predominance of qnrS1; this is consistent
with previous reports.45 Some strains harboring qnrB or
qnrS1 were susceptible to quinolones, this is in accordance
with the very low level resistance (below the resistance
threshold, according to EUCAST-CASFM) conferred by
these genes; however, PMQR determinants can facilitate the
emergence of high-level resistant mutants.46 Furthermore,
animal experiments showed that qnr genes can reduce
bactericidal activity of ciproﬂoxacin like a gyrA mutation.47
Almost all ciproﬂoxacin-resistant isolates (98.6%) had
mutations in gyrA and/or parC genes, all substitutions de-
tected were already described in E. coli,48 and the prevalent
mutation proﬁles were the pattern ‘‘GyrA: S83L+D87N,
ParC: S80I’’ followed by the single substitution ParC: S80I.
‘‘GyrA: S83L+D87N, ParC: S80I’’ was previously reported
among the predominant proﬁles in clinical ﬂuoroquinolone-
isolates in Algeria49 and worldwide.50,51 The
resistant
abundance of this genotype may be related to elimination of
ﬁtness cost associated with S83L+D87N by additional ParC
S80I substitution.52 High levels of resistance up to 64 mg/L
were observed with the single ParC S80I substitution; the
same ﬁnding was reported.53 However, previous studies
showed that this mutation alone is not associated with any
increase in the MIC of ciproﬂoxacin52; thus, the resistance
levels observed are probably related to other mechanisms
such as decreased expression of outer membrane porins or
overexpression of multidrug efﬂux pumps.

Tetracycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used with
other ﬁrst-generation tetracyclines, such as chlortetracycline
and oxytetracycline as animal growth promoter. Second-
generation tetracyclines, such as minocycline and doxycy-
cline, are commonly used in human and veterinary medi-
cine. Almost all of our
isolates
harbored tetA and/or tetB genes with a clear predominance
of tetA gene, in agreement with the fact that generally efﬂux
mechanisms are most prominent, and the tetA gene is
commonly encountered in E. coli isolated from human,

tetracycline-resistant

animals, and animal-derived foods in many countries.54–59
tetB gene was found at
low prevalence in our strains;
however, it confers a high level of resistance, in particular to
minocycline and doxycycline.58

Commonly, sulfonamides and trimethoprim resistance in
E. coli arise from the acquisition of sul and dfr genes, en-
coding drug-resistant variants of dihydropteroate synthases
and dihydrofolate reductases.60 Consistent with our results,
sul2 gene was reported as the most prevalent in E. coli from
human, animals, and animal-derived foods.29,54,55,57,59
E. coli carrying sul2 gene was described as able to colonize
both animals and humans, and animal strains may be im-
plicated in human infections such as UTI and septicemia.61
sul3 gene, reported as rare, was detected at a substantial rate
in our isolates, almost equivalent to that of sul1 gene usually
reported as most frequent after sul2.54,57,59 Concerning tri-
methoprim resistance genes, clusters dfrA1, dfrA5, dfrA7,
dfrA8, and dfrA12 detected in our study are among the most
reported.10,29,59,62

Integrons constitute a mechanism for acquisition and
expression of resistance genes; they play an important role
in the emergence and spread of MDR.63 Over half of our
isolates harbored class 1 integrons, while class 2 integrons
were detected in only about 10%; this is in accordance with
the predominance of class 1 integrons in E. coli from food
animals and foods.9,64,65 The use of antimicrobials, such as
tetracycline and sulfonamides, as growth promoters for farm
animals as beef cattle, may promote the presence and
maintenance of class 1 integrons in E. coli.29 The majority
of detected integrons (73.9%) lacked the 3¢-conserved se-
quence comprising the qacED1-sul1 genes; this truncated
structure was already described, it generally contains a sul3
at the 3¢-end and is linked to various insertion sequences
probably responsible for this rearrangement.66

The PFGE analysis revealed a genetic diversity within the
94 typed isolates; however, clonality was observed among
some isolates of which two clusters of six and seven CTX-
M-14–producing isolates were unrelated to districts; these
ﬁndings are indicative of a possible clonal spread of CTX-
M-14 producers. The difference in resistance genetic content
of some clonal isolates may be related to changes due to
selective pressure or genetic exchange.

Conclusions

To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report to
study bacterial antibiotic resistance in fresh retail beef
meat in Algeria; it highlighted the relatively massive pres-
ence of E. coli isolate producers of various CTX-M ESBLs.
The CTX-M variants, CTX-M-24 and CTX-M-32, are re-
ported for the ﬁrst time in Algeria. Almost all of the iso-
lates were MDR, with resistance to major antibiotics used
in human medicine such as broad spectrum beta-lactams,
ﬂuoroquinolones,
trimethoprim–
sulfamethoxazole. Evidence of both clonal and horizontal
dissemination of resistance genes was also demonstrated.
These ﬁndings are indicative of possible failures in the
management of the use of antibiotics in the food sector and/
or lack of hygiene during the food process and at retail.
From a one health perspective, this is of considerable im-
portance in view of the possibility of antimicrobial resis-
tance transfer between animals and humans.
