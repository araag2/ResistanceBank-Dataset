Mastitis is the most common and economically
significant disease affecting dairy cattle. A variety of
bacteria can be isolated from bovine mastitis cases.
are the
Staphylococcus aureus
most common causes of contagious and environmental
clinical mastitis, respectively. Antimicrobial therapy is
commonly implemented for mastitis prevention and
control. Unfortunately, despite the best possible
antimicrobial treatments, failures of bacteriological
cure are common, especially for
mastitis and
antimicrobial resistance (AMR) which is considered to
be one of the reasons for low cure rates [1]. Additionally,
AMR in bacteria is a public health hazard, and extensive
use of antimicrobial is considered a potentially important
driver of AMR. Several strains of
S. aureus isolated
from mastitis case have been reported to show resistance
against multiple antimicrobials such as penicillin-G,

Beta–lactam antibiotics are frequently used in
mastitis therapy and the resistance is due to the
production of beta-lactamases and low-affinity
β-lactamase
penicillin-binding protein, PBP2A [3].
resistant penicillins such as methicillin and oxacillin
are not used in dairy cows except for cloxacillin t
hat is
used in products for intramammary administration [4].
Methicillin-resistant
(MRSA) have been
isolated from mastitis milk samples and have the
potential to complicate treatment of bovine mastitis
[5]. The presence of MRSA in bovine mastitis is a
potential risk to other exposed cattle and farm workers
including veterinarians [6]. In general, the emergence
and transfer of AMR bacteria or genetic determinants
from animals to human populations via food chain is a
growing concern [7]. Comprehensive information on
the prevalence of AMR in bovine mastitis pathogens in
milk is lacking in India.

The objective of the present study was to study
the prevalence of drug resistant mastitis and their
pattern of antibiotic resistance in dairy cows from

Sampling and bacterial culturing:
one milk samples were collected from acute mastitis
cows from Large Animal Clinic Medicine Unit of
Madras Veterinary College Teaching Hospital and six
dairy farms in Coimbatore district. The guidelines of
National Mastitis Council (NMC) were followed for
sample collection, transportation, culture and isolation
of bacteria.
isolates were identified as gram-
positive cocci by Gram stain, growth on blood agar and
mannitol salt agar and a positive test for catalase and
coagulase [8].
isolates were identified
as gram negative rods by Gram stain, lactose fermen-
ters on MacConkey agar, and a negative oxidase test.
Based on incidence of common causative pathogens
isolates were categorized as
and sensitivity tests,
resistance to 1 or 2
resistant i.e exhibiting
in vitro
antimicrobials and multidrug-resistant i.e exhibiting
in
resistance to 3 or more antimicrobials. Cows with

resistant mastitis were grouped as; Group I:
Escherichia coli
Staphylococcus

(n=104) and Group III: MRSA (n=12).

Antimicro-
Antibiotic susceptibility and resistance:
bial susceptibility testing was carried out with
equivalence of 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard by
agar disc diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar
plates following the guidelines of Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [8]. All the
bacteria isolated were tested
for their sensitivity
to 8 different antibiotics, that are commonly used in
veterinary practice. Commercially available antibiotic
,
discs (Himedia, Mumbai) were used in the study
viz.
enrofloxacin (10 mcg), amoxicillin + sulbacatm (15
mcg), amoxicillin (10 mcg), gentamicin (10 mcg),
ceftriaxone (30 mcg), oxytetracycline (30 mcg) and
penicillin G (10 units) and oxacillin (5 mcg). The sizes
of the zone of inhibition were recorded and interpreted
as either susceptible or resistant to the exposed agent.

in vitro

The minimum
Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC):
inhibitory concentrations of different antibiotics for
E.
and MRSA isolates were determined by
coli, S. aureus
modified resazurin assay microdilution technique [9].
The MIC panels consisted of dehydrated antimicrobial
agents: amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, enrofloxacin,
gentamicin, pencillin, oxytetracycline, amoxicillin +
sulbactam and oxacillin in 96-well U bottom microtiter
plates and performed in accordance with the guidelines

established by the CLSI [8]. The lowest concentration
of antibiotic that resulted in complete inhibition of
visible growth and did not produce any turbidity was
taken as the MIC end point.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for identification of
A single colony with
the mastitis causing bacteria:
typical morphology from the selective agar was
suspended in nuclease free water and lysed by boiling
for 10 minutes and the lysate was stored at -20 C until
use. The lysate were used in a PCR reaction with
primers targeting the specific gene for different strains.
The PCR amplicons from some of the samples were
sequenced and analysed by BLAST search to confirm
their identity. The details of primers used in the study
are described in Table-1.

o

PCR amplification was performed in a total reaction
volume of 25 μl. The reaction mixture contained 12.5
μl of the master mix, 20 pmol of the forward and
reverse primer and 1.5 μl of the test lysate. The
amplification profile for the detection of different
genes were 94°C 5 min; 35 cycles of 95°C for 45 sec,
55°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min; final extension of 72°C
for 7 min. The PCR products were separated by gel
electrophoresis in 1.5 per cent agarose gel using 1x Tris
acetate EDTA buffer along with standard DNA marker
(100 bp ladder, Genei, Bangalore) and visualized with
ethidium bromide staining.

Discussion

Bacillus

spp. and

Streptococcus

In the present study, no resistance were observed
for
the
spp.
Antimicrobial resistance has been reported to be most
common among the Staphylococcal mastitis isolates
with a much lower proportion of Streptococcal isolates
exhibiting resistance [14]. The antibiotic usage has
directly contributed to an increased prevalence of
mastitis [15]. All antimicrobial use in
resistant
the herd may affect the resistance of
isolates by
increasing the presence of these antimicrobial agents in
the cow's environment. The incidence of resistant
S.
mastitis was higher which might be due to
aureus
indiscriminate use of antibiotics and intramammary
preparations containing combinations and broad-
spectrum antibiotics [16].

MRSA strains have been observed to be multi-
drug resistant, such as aminoglycosides, macrolides,

which are often used in the treatment of mastitis [17].
In the present study, multidrug resistance to methi-
cillin, amoxicillin, penicillin and oxytetracycline was
commonly observed in MRSA mastitis. MRSA strains

were multi-drug resistant which might be due to
production of betalactamase and PBP2a (penicillin
binding protein) [17]. A previous study indicates the
prevalence of 13 percent of
MRSA isolates
from cows with mastitis in a herd located in northwest
India [2]. High incidence in the present study might be
due to indiscriminate use of antibiotics and consequent
transfer of plasmid mediated antibiotic resistance and
concurred with above authors. Indiscriminate use of
antibiotics and intramammary preparations used by the
owner without the prescription of the veterinarian is
also attributed to be one of the reasons for increasing
incidence of these strains.

Gram negative pathogens were more sensitive to
enrofloxacin and gentamicin and less sensitive to
ampicillin and penicillin [18]. In the present study,
incidence of resistant
mastitis was higher which
could be due to the wide antibiotic usage [15].

These susceptible antibiotic drugs will be used as

the resistant strains may be transferred to milk from

handling during milking, transmission to the milk
utensils, which could be the reason for infection in
human beings.

The present study has demonstrated the existence
of alarming levels of resistance of

the study farms and the results are in accordance with
reports from earlier studies in other countries. Edward

resistance from prolonged and indiscriminate usage of
some antimicrobials. It is therefore, very important to
implement a systemic application of an
anti-
biotic susceptibility test prior to the use of antibiotics in
both treatment and prevention of intra-mammary
infections.

Only a few studies in India have been carried out
to assess MRSA status among mastitis infections [2].
The presence of MRSA signifies alarming levels of
resistance. Further it highlights the need for preventing
the indiscriminate use of antibiotics. Avoiding routine
antimicrobial use in food animals and to decrease
selection pressure against anti-microbials, might decrease
the prevalence of MRSA among cows.

Conclusion

and

E. coli

AMR prevalence was more common in bovine
mastitis pathogens namely
S. aureus.
Overall, antimicrobial
resistance to penicillin,
amoxicillin, oxytetracycline and methicillin was found
in clinical mastitis cases. Multidrug resistance was
more commonly observed in MRSA isolates than in
E.

S. aureus
isolates screened was positive for MRSA (Prevalence
of 10.34%). This study result suggests that a high risk
