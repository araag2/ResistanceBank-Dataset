we  collected  102  E.  coli  isolates  from  diseased  pigs  and  204  from  healthy  ones  in 

Henan  province  of  China.  Then,  we  screened  antimicrobial  resistance  and  mcr-1  of 

bacteria.  There  was  25.5%  (78/306)  mcr-1  positive  porcine  E.  coli,  in  which  46 

Colistin has been used as the last-line antibiotic for Escherichia coli infections. Herein, 

Introduction   

Colistin  has  been  routinely  used  for  treatments  of  farm  animals,  like  swine  and 

poultry,  from  the  early  1980s  in  the  world  (Tängdén  and  Giske,  2015).  The 

plasmid-mediated  mcr  colistin  resistance  genes  (from  mcr-1  to  mcr-5  )  have  been 

described  in  Escherichia  coli,  Klebsiella  pneumonia,  Salmonella  spp.,  Enterobacter 

aerogenes,  Enterobacter  cloacae,  and  Pseudomonas  spp  (Borowiak  et  al.,  2017; 

Carattoli et al., 2017; Quesada et al., 2016; Torpdahl et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017;

including humans, animals, retail meat  and the environment (Bai et al., 2016;  Liu et 

al., 2016), since mcr-1 was initially discovered in 2015 (Liu et al., 2016). Meanwhile, 

the  coexistence  of  mcr  genes  and  other  resistance  genes,  such  as  blaCTX-M,  blaTEM, 

blaNDM, blaKPC, fosA, qnrS, floR and oqxAB (Bi et al., 2017; Lai et al., 2017; Li et al., 

2017; Sun et al., 2016), is of great concern. So, the emergence and dissemination of 

mcr  genes  in  Enterobacteriaceae  is  worrying  as  it  could  limit  the  usefulness  of 

colistin  and  severely  affect  the  possibility  of  treating  infections  caused  by 

multidrug-resistant,  extensively  drug-resistant  and  pan-resistant  gram-negative 

pathogens globally (Wang et al., 2017).

To date, although mcr-2, mcr-3, mcr-4 and mcr-5 colistin resistance genes have been 

identified persistently, mcr-1 remains the predominant in China. Significantly varying 

levels  of  mcr-1  carriage  in  different  E.  coli  samples  were  reported,  which  have 

apparently associated with origins (Wang et al., 2017). In 2015, Liu et al. proved that 

diseased  animals  or  not.  Therefore,  this  study  was  conducted  to  evaluate  the 

occurrence  of  mcr-1  in  E.  coli  isolated  from  healthy  or  diseased  pigs  in  Henan 

the mcr-1 prevalence in E. coli were 1% of inpatients with infection, 15% of raw meat 

and  21%  of  healthy  pigs  (Liu  et  al.,  2016).  Rhouma  &Letellier  thought  a  historical 

link  has  existed  between  mcr-1,  extended-spectrum  β-lactamase  (ESBL)  and 

carbapenemase  (Rhouma  and  Letellier,  2017).  But,  little  research  has  demonstrated 

whether  the  mcr-1  prevalence  of  E.  coli  is  associated  with  isolates  from  healthy  or

Material and methods   

Bacterial isolates   

We  collected  306  porcine  E.  coli  isolates  from  diseased  or  healthy  pigs  in  Henan 

provinces from June 1, 2016 to Feb 28, 2017. The 204 E. coli from healthy pigs were 

randomly  collected from pig  farms by  rectal swab. No more than five samples were 

collected from the same pig farm. The 102 E. coli from diseased pigs were collected 

from animal hospitals. All samples were aseptically obtained from liver swabs as soon 

as  sick  pigs  died,  which  were  diagnosed  as  colibacillosis  and  had  received

antimicrobial  treatment  for  3  or  more  days,  and  seeded  in  macconkey  agar 

immediately. 

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing 

We  calculated  minimum  inhibitory  concentrations  (MICs)  of  colistin,  amoxicillin, 

ceftiofur,  cefquinome,  gentamicin,  amikacin,  oxycycline,  doxycycline,  florfenicol, 

sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim(5/1), enrofloxacin, olaquindox, and mequindox for all 

isolates  using  the  broth  microdilution  method  in  accordance  with  the  Clinical  & 

Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, and we interpreted the results in accordance

The  resistance  rates  and  resistance  profiles  of  E.  coli  with  or  without  mcr-1,  the 

resistance rates of E. coli from diseased or healthy pigs were documented in Statistical 

Packages of Social Sciences (SPSS) software for Windows, version 20.0 (IBM Corp., 

Armonk,  NY,  USA).  Statistical  analysis  was  performed  using  descriptive  statistics, 

and  χ2-test  was  used  for  testing  group  differences,  with  P<0.05  set  as  the  level  of 

significant differences, P<0.01 set as the level of extremely significant differences.

Screening   

We screened all colistin-resistance isolates (MIC≥2 μg/ml) for the presence of mcr-1 

using  PCR  with  primers  mcr-1-forward  (5ʹ-GCTCGGTCAGTCCGTTTG-3ʹ)  and 

mcr-1-reverse  (5ʹ-GAATGCGGTGCGGTCTTT-3ʹ).  The  resulting  amplicons  were 

subsequently sequenced.

Results 

The MIC profiles of E. coli from diseased or healthy pigs 

In  the  present  study,  the  resistance  rates  was  significantly  higher  in  E.  coli  isolates 

from  diseased  pigs  (n=102)  than  those  from  healthy  pigs  (n=204)  for  colistin 

(P=0.000),  ceftiofur  (P=0.000),  cefquinome  (P=0.000),  gentamicin  (P=0.000), 

amikacin  (P=0.000),  doxycycline  (P=0.001),  florfenicol  (P=0.005),  enrofloxacin 

(P=0.000),  and  olaquindox  (P=0.000)  (Table  1).  There  were  large  differences  in 

MIC50  between  isolates  from  diseased  pigs  and  those  from  healthy  pigs,  with 

differences of more than 1024-fold for ceftiofur, 256-fold for cefquinome, 64-fold for 

gentamicin, and 64-fold for enrofloxacin. Moreover, the MIC90 values of isolates from 

diseased  pigs  were  also  apparently  higher  than  those  from  healthy  pigs,  which  were 

more than eight-fold for gentamicin, more than 128-fold for amikacin and 16-fold for

There  were  three  colistin-resistance  isolates  which  did  not  carry  mcr-1  gene  but 

probably  harbored  the  mcr-1  variants  (Borowiak  et  al.,  2017;  Carattoli  et  al.,  2017; 

Xavier  et  al.,  2016;  Yin  et  al.,  2017).  In  78  mcr-1  positive  isolates,  we  found  46 

(45.1%,  46/102)  E.  coli  obtained  from  diseased  pigs,  the  others  (15.7%,  32/204)

Discussion   

The  mcr-1  carriages  have  apparently  associated  with  origins.  In  the  initial  report  on 

the discovery of mcr-1 in China, Liu and colleagues reported a high prevalence of the 

mcr-1among E. coli (21%) collected from healthy pigs (Liu et al., 2016), which were 

Colistin has not yet been approved for use in human beings in China, but it has been 

used  in  animals  as  a therapeutic  drug  and  feed  additive  since  the  early  1980s.  Since 

April, 2017, colistin has been formally banned from animal feeds in China because of 

the  mcr-1  emergence  and  quickly  spread.  However,  the  high  mcr-1  carriages  in 

samples  from  diseased  pigs  (45.1%)  were  still  surprising,  which  suggested  that 

previous antimicrobial  agents  exposure was strongly associated with  the presence of 

mcr-1.   

The mcr-1 positive E. coli presented more serious resistance to ceftiofur, cefquinome,

similar to those from pigs in our results (25.5%, 78/306), but a little more than those 

from  healthy  pigs  (15.7%,  32/204).  Meanwhile,  the  mcr-1  carriages  of  E.  coli  was 

about  1%  from  patients  (  Liassine  et  al.,  2016;  Liu  et  al.,  2016;  Quan  et  al.,  2017; 

Wang et al., 2017), 3.5% from ESBL-producing strains of human faecal samples (Bi 

et  al.,  2017),  which  were  less  than  Shiga  toxin-producing  E.  coli  from  healthy  pigs 

(10.7%) (Bai et al., 2016), extremely less than those from pigs in our results (25.5%).

other  resistance  genes  on  the  same  plasmids,  for  example  blaNDM,  blaCTX-M,  blaTEM, 

blaCMY, fosA, qnrS, floR and oqxAB (Bi et al., 2017; Lai et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017;
