ABSTRACT

INTRODUCTION

This study evaluated the prevalence of multidrug re-
sistant Staphylococcus aureus in Kenyan milk and in-
vestigated any differences in antimicrobial resistance
between large- (>200 L/d) and small- (<50 L/d) scale
producers. Susceptibility proﬁles for penicillin G, tetra-
cycline, erythromycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethazine,
and chloramphenicol were determined for Staph.
aureus (n = 402) isolated from cows with subclinical
mastitis. There was a signiﬁcant difference in the over-
all mean resistance proﬁle between large- (7.1%) and
small-scale farm (14.7%) isolates. The overall preva-
lence of multidrug resistance (≥2 antibiotics) differed
signiﬁcantly between isolates from small farms (34.3%)
and those from large farms (18.0%). Additionally, the
producers were interviewed about their usage of anti-
microbial drugs and their attitudes toward education
in related ﬁelds. There was an evident difference be-
tween the producer types in their documentation of the
use of antimicrobial drugs. Small-scale farms were less
inclined to documentation, and treatment records were
available from 22% of small-scale farms, compared with
73% of large-scale farms. Farmers expressed a need
for more information in 5 areas, ranking preventive
management highest (34.0%); followed by affordable
tests to control residues in milk (22.8%); preparation
of antimicrobial drugs (20.0%); public health concerns
(11.2%); disposal of surplus antimicrobial drugs (7.8%);
and antimicrobial drug residue persistence in milk
(4.2%). It was concluded that herd size might be an
indirect risk factor in the development of antimicrobial
resistance in Staph. aureus within the region.

In Kenya the overall consumption of antimicrobial
drugs in animal production is estimated at 14,594 kg/
yr; tetracyclines, β-lactams, trimethoprim/sulfa, nitro-
furans, aminoglycosides, and quinolones being the most
commonly used drugs (Mitema et al., 2001). As in most
countries, it is not possible to specify the amount of
different drugs used in speciﬁc animal production types.
The majority of the antimicrobial drugs, however, are
used to treat mastitis in dairy cattle, Staphylococcus
aureus being the main target (Odongo and Ambani,
1989). Concern has been raised regarding the indis-
criminate or unnecessary use of veterinary drugs, par-
ticularly when used in all cows without ﬁrst determin-
ing their infection status. In Kenya, many of the large
dairy producers adhere to recommended management
regimens and may have documented records on antimi-
crobial drug usage. The large-scale producers, however,
only contribute 30% of the produced milk in the country,
whereas the remaining 70% comes from small dairy
farms (Omore et al., 1999). Milk from small dairy farms
is often consumed locally, being collected daily and sold
unrefrigerated by local traders, the so-called hawkers.
The small-scale producers, with fewer resources and
lacking relevant knowledge, may not follow recom-
mended treatment regimens when using antibiotics, as
manifested in the higher prevalence of antimicrobial
drug residues in their milk (Shitandi and Sternesjo¨,
2003).

It is well known that the usage of antimicrobial
agents correlates with the emergence and maintenance
of drug resistance in the microbial ﬂora of animals.
Although there is evidence suggesting that develop-
ment of antibiotic-resistant human microﬂora in hospi-
tals is mainly caused by the use of antimicrobial agents
by the medical profession (Wiedemann, 1993), the im-
pact of the use of antibiotics in agriculture on resistance
development in humans remains to be determined.

The objective of this study was to compare antibiotic
susceptibilities of Staph. aureus isolates from the 2
dairy producer categories in Kenya. It was hypothesized
that if there were any differences in adherence to recom-

mended regimens of the use of antimicrobial drugs, it
would be manifested in the resistance proﬁle of Staph.
aureus isolates from the 2 producer categories.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Selection of Dairy Farms and Sampling of Milk

The study was undertaken in the Nakuru district of
the Rift Valley, Kenya, and the animals consisted of
crosses of Friesian and domestic cattle. The farms (ap-
proximately 500 herds) were selected on their willing-
ness to participate and were visited for milk sampling
during 2001 and 2002. The majority of animals were 3
lactations old or less and in the ﬁrst 3 mo of the current
lactation. The herds that were visited were divided into
2 categories, small-scale (<50 L/herd per d) and large-
scale producers (>200 L/herd per d), although there was
no distinct cutoff between the 2. On average, the small
farms had 5 lactating animals, and the large herds had
an average size of 40 lactating animals.

During the farm visits, lactating cows were randomly
selected for collection of milk samples and initially
screened for subclinical mastitis using the California
mastitis test (CMT). Samples from cows with clinical
mastitis were not included in this study. The CMT (De-
Laval, Wroclaw, Poland) was carried out as described
by Schalm and Noorlander (1957). The reaction was
visually scored as 1 to 5 according to the Scandinavian
recommendations (Klastrup and Schmidt, 1974) where
a score ≥2 was regarded as positive. Cows with a posi-
tive CMT result had quarter-milk samples collected
according to IDF Standard 50 B (1985). Samples were
immediately cooled and transported to the microbiology
laboratory at Egerton University for identiﬁcation of
Staph. aureus. During sampling, the milk producers
were interviewed regarding herd management in rela-
tion to mastitis and antimicrobial drug therapy and
asked whether there were speciﬁc areas where they felt
a need for education.

Bacteriological Examinations

Isolation and identiﬁcation of Staph. aureus were per-
formed according to the National Mastitis Council rec-
ommendations on examination of quarter-milk samples
(1992). Brieﬂy, immediately after delivery, the milk
samples were inoculated on blood agar plates (Difco,
Detroit, MI), which were divided into 4 sections. A 10-
μL loop was used to streak the milk sample, and 6 to
8 lines were made in one agar section. Samples were
incubated for 24 to 72 h at 37°C and examined for
bacterial growth. Pure cultures were further examined
for morphological, staining, and cultural characteris-
tics, and for biochemical reactions according to stan-

dard keys. Staphylococci were studied in particular for
hemolysis and coagulase production. Coagulase testing
was performed according to a tube method using oxa-
lated rabbit plasma in a 1:10 dilution in a nutrient
broth (Arbeit, 1988). Only typical colonies identiﬁed as
Staph. aureus were stored in cryogenic vials containing
1 mL of trypticase soy broth containing 15% glycerin
at −80°C.

Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing

From the Staph. aureus isolates, 201 were selected
from each of the 2 producer categories, each isolate
representing a single strain from a single herd. Before
antibiotic susceptibility testing (NCCLS, 2002), the iso-
lates were revived by subculturing on blood agar base
(Difco) at 35°C for 24 h. The isolates were tested for
their susceptibility to 5 different antimicrobial drugs:
penicillin G, tetracycline, erythromycin, trimethoprim/
sulfamethazine, and chloramphenicol. The antibiotic
disks (Oxoid, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) were gen-
tly pressed to ensure contact with the inoculated
Mueller-Hinton agar surface, and the plates were incu-
bated at 35°C. The plates were examined after 18 h and
the zones of inhibition were measured to the nearest
millimeter. The interpretive breakpoints for resistance
were determined according to the standard table pro-
vided by the manufacturer of the antibiotic disks, and
the isolates were reported as susceptible, intermediate,
or resistant. For quality control, Staph. aureus ATCC
25923 was used as control strain. It should be pointed
out that the interpretive breakpoints used were origi-
nally developed for human infections.

Analysis of susceptibility testing was by category
agreement, where the zone diameters were divided into
different categories (susceptible, intermediate, and re-
sistant). Statistical signiﬁcance of differences in resis-
tance was evaluated using Minitab software (version
2000). The χ2-test with Yates correction was performed
on the cross-tabulated categories resistant/susceptible,
after combining intermediate and resistant isolates into
one category (resistant). A P value of <0.05 was consid-
ered statistically signiﬁcant.

Semi-Structured Interview

A pretested semiquantitative questionnaire was used
to determine descriptive characteristics of both small-
and large-scale producers, interviews being carried out
as adapted from Veldhuizen et al. (1997). The facilitator
prepared a checklist of important indices and exercises
(ranking) to be covered. This allowed the interview to
be ﬂexible and permitted the respondents to express
their thoughts in their own words and within their own

conceptual frameworks. The producers (n = 242) were
questioned about their usage of antimicrobial drugs and
their attitudes toward education in related subjects.
Indices used as prompts were: preventive management,
existing residue control tests, preparation of antimicro-
bial drugs, public health concerns, disposal of surplus
antimicrobial drugs, and persistence of antimicrobial
drug residues in milk. The availability of records docu-
menting treatments (treatment date, animal identiﬁ-
cation, type of antibiotic, dose, withholding period) on
the farms was also established in the interviews.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Staphylococcus aureus is regarded as an important
mastitis pathogen in the bovine in Kenya and is the
most frequent pathogen isolated from mastitic milk
(Odongo and Ambani, 1989). In this study, the preva-
lence of Staph. aureus in milk from the sampled cows
was found to be 30.6%, which was lower than in the
studies by Ngatia (1988), who observed a prevalence of
55%. The previous study was, however, concentrated
around a single area, and the ﬁndings from the current
study represent a wider geographic region.

The quality control organisms yielded values within
the established ranges, indicating that the test was
performed in a satisfactory manner. Comparing isolates
from small and large farms, there was a difference in
the overall mean prevalence of resistance of 7.6%. The
difference in overall mean susceptibility was 4.7% be-
tween isolates from the 2 farm categories. The differ-
ence in overall distribution of the susceptibility pat-
terns was compared using the χ2 test and found to be
signiﬁcant (P < 0.05). For this comparison, resistant
and intermediate isolates were combined. There was a
signiﬁcant difference (P < 0.05) between isolates from
the producer categories in their susceptibility to penicil-
lin G and tetracycline (Table 1). This likely indicates
differences in the usage pattern of the 2 antibiotics
between large- and small-scale producers and a selec-
tion pressure for these antibiotics on small farms. In an

earlier study (Shitandi and Sternesjo¨, 2001), penicillin
was the most commonly found type of antibiotic residue
in milk, with levels often exceeding the maximum resi-
due limit for penicillin G in milk established in the
European Union (4 μg/kg) by 2-fold. Because there was
little information regarding the actual use of drugs and
treatment regimens on the different farms, a relation-
ship between antimicrobial usage and resistance could
not be conclusively established in this study.

In Kenya, there is no formal system for surveillance
of antibiotic resistance in animal bacterial isolates, a
common trend in many low-income countries (Hart and
Kariuki, 1998). Among the 402 isolates from the 2 types
of farms, multiple resistance, deﬁned as lack of suscep-
tibility to at least 2 antibiotics from different families,
was observed in 69 (34.3%) of the isolates from the
small-scale farms compared with 36 (17.9%) of the iso-
lates from the large-scale farms (Table 2). The differ-
ence in overall prevalence of multidrug resistant Staph.
aureus isolates between the 2 producer categories was
signiﬁcant as determined by the χ2 test (P < 0.05), com-
bining resistant and intermediate isolates in the com-
parison.

Staphylococcus aureus has developed multidrug re-
sistance in many regions of the world (World Health
Organization, 2000), although reported prevalence
rates indicate that wide variations exist regionally and
even from herd to herd (Waage et al., 2002). Penicillin
often predicts susceptibility to other β-lactamase-sensi-
tive antimicrobial agents, for example, ampicillin, and
this has been used in several studies of Staph. aureus
resistance. In an Argentinian study, penicillin resis-
tance was reported to be 30% (Gentilini et al., 2000).
In Finland, more than 50% of the Staph. aureus isolates
are penicillin-resistant (Pitka¨la¨ et al., 2004), which is
signiﬁcantly higher than data reported from other Nor-
dic countries, for example, 30% in Denmark (DANMAP,
2002), 5% in Norway (NORM/NORM-VET, 2000), and
7% (Staph. aureus isolated from acute clinical mastitis)
in Sweden (SVARM, 2003). The high penicillin resis-
tance amongst Staph. aureus in Finland is likely due to

the wide use of intramammary preparations containing
combinations and broad-spectrum antibiotics (Pitka¨la¨
et al., 2004), in contrast to the stringent policies in
place for usage of antimicrobial drugs in countries such
as Sweden.

The overall proportion of farmers with a documented
use of antimicrobial drugs was 41.3%. Treatment re-
cords and protocols were more likely to be absent among
small-scale producers (78%) than among large-scale
producers (27%); odds ratio = 9.5, 95% conﬁdence inter-
val = 5.2 to 17.3. The difference in the overall distribu-
tion of the availability of treatment records between
the 2 producer categories was signiﬁcant (P < 0.05). The
lack of documentation amongst small-scale producers,
however, should be taken cautiously, as this in itself
does not indicate nonusage. There could be other risk
factors such as inappropriate dose or combination of
drugs, even when documentation is present.

The study was also interested in identifying underly-
ing reasons and farmer needs which might contribute
to the antimicrobial resistance problems. From the re-
sults, 34% of the farmers ranked information on the
use of preventive management to minimize reliance
on antibiotics and treatment programs highest of the
indices (Table 3). They also expressed a need for a sim-
ple, sensitive, and inexpensive test to control residues,
and for information on the correct handling of antimi-
crobial drugs on farm. From the additional remarks
made, respondents were able to detect the clinical form
of mastitis. Subclinical cases might, however, go unde-
tected due to lack of knowledge and necessary diagnos-
tic facilities, in agreement with the situation in Ethio-
pia (Hussein et al., 1997). Efforts by the farmer were
seemingly focused on treatment of clinical cases rather

than on preventative measures. Most dairy farmers
may thus not be aware of the existence of the subclinical
form or the importance of resistant strains and their
potential transfer from animals to humans (Witte,
1998). The risk that consumers are directly exposed to
drug-resistant bacteria is, however, minimized by the
fact that milk is seldom consumed without ﬁrst being
boiled. In Kenya, milk is traditionally not consumed as
drinking milk but is more commonly used for prepara-
tion of a meal, e.g., porridge.

CONCLUSIONS

This study suggests herd size is an indirect risk factor
in the development of antibiotic resistance in Staph.
aureus, as evident from the observed differences in anti-
microbial susceptibility and prevalence of drug resis-
tant Staph. aureus in milk between producer categories
in Kenya. Due to lack of documentation regarding treat-
ment regimens and difﬁculties in establishing the types
of antimicrobial drugs the small-scale farmers actually
used, the relationship between the use of drugs and
resistance development could not be investigated.
