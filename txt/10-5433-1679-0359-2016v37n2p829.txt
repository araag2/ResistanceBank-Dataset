Abstract

Bacterial  resistance  is  a  primary  public  health  concern  worldwide.  Within  this  context,  pets  and 
breeding  animals  act  as  reservoirs  for  multidrug-resistant  bacteria  (MR),  such  as  those  producing 
extended  spectrum  beta-lactamases  (ESBL)  and  those  presenting  plasmid-mediated  quinolone 
resistance (PMQR). The aim of this study was to detect the presence of ESBL and PMQR in members 
of the Enterobacteriaceae family, isolated from healthy sheep and dogs from non-intense farming rural 
properties in the Umuarama region of Paraná, Brazil. A total of 81 oral and rectal swabs from dogs and 
sheep from 11 small rural properties were analyzed. These swabs were inoculated in tubes containing 
brain heart infusion broth (BHI), and the resulting cultures were inoculated on MacConkey agar (MAC) 
supplemented with 10 μg/mL cefotaxime for the selection of ESBL producers. The cells were also plated 
on MAC supplemented with 50 μg/mL nalidixic acid for selecting quinolone-resistant enterobacteria. 
The  bacterial  isolates  were  subjected  to  biochemical  identification  tests,  antibiograms,  double-disk 
synergic tests, and polymerase chain reaction analysis for resistance-inducing genes (blaESBL, qnr, and 
genes encoding efflux pump and acetylases). Four (5.00%) bacterial isolates (3 Escherichia coli and 
1 Morganella morganii) resistant to cephalosporins and/or quinolones were identified; of these, three 
(75%) isolates were from sheep and one (25%) from a dog. These findings indicate the presence of MR 
bacteria in the normal microbiota of the animals studied. Animals colonized with such bacteria can

Resumo

Resistência bacteriana é considerado o maior problema de saúde pública mundial da atualidade, sendo 
os relatos de infecções e surtos causados por bactérias multirresistentes cada vez mais frequentes na 
clínica  veterinária  e  humana.  Neste  contexto,  animais  de  companhia  e  criação  podem  atuar  como 
reservatório de bactérias multirresistentes, como as produtoras de beta-lactamases de espectro estendido 
(ESBL) e as que apresentam resistência as quinolonas mediada por plasmídeos (PMQR). O objetivo 
deste trabalho foi detectar beta-lactamases de espectro estendido e resistência as quinolonas mediada 
por plasmídeos em membros da família Enterobacteriaceae isolados de ovinos e cães de propriedades 
rurais não tecnificadas da região de Umuarama, Paraná, Brasil. Foram analisados 81 swabs de cães e 
ovinos provenientes de 11 pequenas propriedades rurais da região de Umuarama (PR). Os swabs foram 
inoculados em caldo Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) e o crescimento obtivo foi em seguida semeado em 
placas de Petri contendo ágar MacConkey (MC) acrescido de cefotaxima 10 μg/mL para seleção de 
bactérias gram-negativas produtoras de ESBL; e placas contendo MC acrescido de ácido nalidíxico 
50 g/mL para seleção de bactérias gram-negativas resistentes as quinolonas. Os isolados bacterianos 
obtidos  foram  submetidos  a  testes  de  antibiograma  pelo  método  de  disco-difusão  em  ágar,  teste 
sinérgico do duplo-disco e reação em cadeia da polimerase (PCR) para genes que conferem resistência 
do tipo ESBL e para quinolonas. Dos 81 swabs coletados foi possível detectar quatro (4,97%) isolados 
bacterianos (3Escherichia coli e 1 Morganellamorganii) resistentes a cefalosporinas e/ou quinolonas. 
Destes isolados, três (75%) eram de ovinos e um (25%) de cão. Os resultados encontrados indicam a 
presença de cepas multirresistentes na microbiota normal dos animais estudados. Nesta condição, os 
animais colonizados podem contribuir para disseminação dos agentes bacterianos para outros animais, 
ambiente e/ou  homem, ou  em uma situação desfavorável o  hospedeiro pode  adquirir uma infecção 
endógena, com prognóstico desfavorável decorrente da falha terapêutica mediada pela expressão de 
genes de resistência para antibacterianos considerados de última escolha terapêutica.

Introduction

is  considered 

Antimicrobial  resistance 

the 
primary  public  health  issue  in  the  current  global 
scenario.  Infections  and  outbreaks  caused  by 
multidrug-resistant  bacteria  are  frequent  in  both 
human  and  veterinary  medicine,  and  in  some 
cases, the isolated microorganisms are resistant to 
all  available  antimicrobial  drugs  (SOUZA,  2010; 
JONG et al., 2011; TEO et al., 2012; WHO, 2014).
The  emergence  and  selection  of  multidrug-
resistant strains is related to the inappropriate use 
of antimicrobial drugs during treatment, as well as 

their use as growth promoters and for prophylaxis 
in veterinary medicine. In both cases, the antibiotic 
dosage is lower than that in therapeutic use, easing 
the  appearance  of  mutations  and/or  acquisition 
of  resistance  genes  due  to  selective  pressure 
(CARATTOLI, 2008; SOUZA et al., 2010; ISHII et 
al., 2011).

Studies in different countries have reported the 
presence  of  cephalosporin  and  quinolone  residues 
in animal-derived products such as meat, milk, and 
eggs. This situation increases the risk of emergence 
or  selection  of  multidrug-resistant  strains,  such 
as 
those  producing  extended  spectrum  beta-

(VRAGOVIĆ  et  al.,  2011;  WHO,  2011).  By 
definition,  ESBL-producing  strains  are  resistant  to 
penicillins,  cephalosporins,  and  monobactams,  but 
are sensitive to clavulanate (PEIRANO et al., 2011). 
These enzymes hydrolyze the beta-lactamic ring on 
the antibiotic, resulting in its deactivation. Currently, 
there are more than 370 known ESBL variants, most 
of  which  are  encoded  by  plasmidial  genes.  The 
most frequently identified ESBL variants are TEM, 
SHV, OXA, and CTX-M (MINARINI et al., 2007; 
PEIRANO et al., 2011; LAGO et al., 2010).

Quinolones  represent  the  antibiotic  category 
used  in  the  feeding  of  animals,  thereby  enabling 
the  selection  of  resistant  strains  and  consequently 
allowing these production animals to act as potential 
reservoirs  and  transmitters  of  multidrug-resistant 
bacteria to other animals, the environment and also 
to humans (WHO, 2011). 

Resistance  to  quinolones  can  be  caused  by 
mutations  in  the  genes  encoding  topoisomerase 
and  DNA  gyrase  or  by  the  presence  of  resistance 
plasmids.  The  latter  mechanism  is  known  as 
plasmid-mediated  quinolone  resistance  (PMQR) 
(STRAHILEVITZ  et  al.,  2009;  KARAH  et 
al.,  2010;  RODRÍGUEZ-MARTÍNEZ  et  al., 
2011).  Known  PMQR  mechanisms  include:  (1) 
the  protection  of  gyrase  and 
topoisomerases 
mediated by qnr genes (ROBICSEK et al., 2006a; 
CATTOIR;  NORDMANN,  2009;  KARAH  et  al., 
2010;  STRAHILEVITZ  et  al.,  2009;  BAE  et  al., 
2010;  RODRÍGUEZ-MARTÍNEZ  et  al.,  2011; 
ZHAO et al., 2010); (2) acetylation of quinolones 
and  fluoroquinolones  mediated  by  the  aac(6  ́)-Ib-
cr  gene  (ROBICSEK  et  al.,  2006b;  CATTOIR; 
NORDMANN,  2009;  JACOBY  et  al.,  2009; 
KARAH  et  al.,  2010;  STRAHILEVITZ  et  al., 
2009;  RODRÍGUEZ-MARTÍNEZ  et  al.,  2011); 
and  (3)  efflux  pumps  that  expel  quinolones  and 
fluoroquinolones from the bacterial cell (CATTOIR; 
NORDMANN, 2009; MA et al., 2009; CATTOIR; 
NORDMANN, 2009; STRAHILEVITZ et al., 2009; 
BAE et al., 2010; KARAH et al., 2010; HERRERA-
LEÓN et al., 2011).

In recent years, the frequency of isolating ESBL-
producing  and/or  quinolone-resistant  members  of 
Enterobacteriaceae has increased because infections 
caused  by  these  bacteria  have  limited  therapeutic 
alternatives,  causing  grave  concern  among  health 
authorities and institutions (ALDRED et al., 2014; 
CAUMO et al., 2010). Studies involving different 
animal  species,  including  production  animals  and 
isolated  Enterobacteriaceae  family 
pets,  have 
members  producing  different  types  of  ESBLs, 
including TEM, SHV, and CTX (PEIRANO et al., 
2011; LAGO et al., 2010). 

Animals  colonized  by  ESBL-producing  and/
or  PMQR  harboring  strains  can  be  asymptomatic 
carriers, and invariably contribute to dissemination 
of  these  bacterial  agents  to  other  animals  and/or 
humans. Alternatively, such animals can harbor an 
endogenous  infection  in  unfavorable  conditions, 
which  have  poor  prognosis  due  to  therapeutic 
failures, as measured by the expression of resistant 
genes to antibacterial drugs considered as the last 
therapeutic  choice.  The  aim  of  this  paper  was  to 
detect  ESBL-producing  and/or  quinolone-resistant 
strains among Enterobacteriaceae family members 
isolated  from  healthy  sheep  and  dogs  from  rural 
properties  in  the  Umuarama  region  of  Paraná, 
Brazil. 

Materials and Methods
Ethics committee

This  project  was  submitted  to  the  Ethics 
Committee in Animal Experimentation (Comitê de 
Ética  em  Experimentação  Animal  –  CEPEEA)  at 
UNIPAR and was approved under protocol number 
25113/2014 on 25/Jul/2013.

Location & sampling

A  total  of  81  swabs  were  collected  from  dogs 
and sheep, in the period of February to June 2014. 
Of these 81 swabs, 50 were collected from the rectal 
cavity  of  mixed  breed  sheep  in  their  reproductive

cavity of mongrel dogs of age greater than one year 
(17 male and 14 female), from 11 small non-intense 
farming  properties  for  sheep  exploitation  in  the 
region of Umuarama, in the northeastern region in 
the state of Paraná, Brazil.

In the small rural properties studied, the sheep 
were  raised  for  subsistence  and  as  a  source  of 
income.  Dogs  were  present  in  all  these  rural 
properties.  No  animal  (whether  sheep  or  dog) 
presented clinical signs of infectious disease upon 
physical examination.

Collection of samples

Rectal  and  oral  samples  were  collected  using 
swabs  containing  AIMES  medium  +  activated 
charcoal (Copan Transystem©, Italy), which were 
introduced  in  the  rectal  ampoule  of  each  sheep, 
compressing it with rotating moves; and in the oral 
cavity  of  dogs,  with  circular  and  rotating  moves 
performed  in  the  gingiva  and  tongue  regions. All 
samples were preserved and sent under refrigeration 
to the Laboratory of Preventive Veterinary Medicine 
and  Public  Health  from  the  Masters  Program  in 
Animal  Science  at  the  Paranaense  University 
(UNIPAR) for subsequent analysis. 

Bacterial isolation and identification

Tubes containing 3.0 mL of brain heart infusion 
(BHI) medium were inoculated with the collected 
rectal and oral swabs and incubated for 24 hours at 
37 °C. Subsequently, the cultures inoculated on Petri 
plates  containing  MacConkey  agar  supplemented 
with 10 µ/mL cefotaxime (CTX) and MacConkey 
agar  supplemented  with  50  µg/mL  nalidixic  acid 
(NAL) and incubated for 24 hours at 37 °C to isolate 
colonies resistant to cephalosporin and quinolones. 
The isolated colonies were stored in BHI medium 
+ glycerol 80% solution at –20 °C for preservation.

Biochemical identification of bacterial isolates

Biochemical identification of bacteria belonging 
to  the  Enterobacteriaceae  family  was  performed 
using the “Kit para Enterobactérias (Enterobacteria 
kit)”  (NewProv®,  Paraná,  Brazil),  following  the 
manufacturer’s recommendations.

Phenotypic tests for antimicrobial susceptibility

(ATM), 

aztreonam 

To  determine  the  antibiotic  resistance  profile, 
the disk-diffusion in agar method was used, as per 
recommendations  of  the  Clinical  and  Laboratory 
Standards Institute (CLSI, 2013). The disks tested 
were:  gentamicin  (GEN),  ciprofloxacin  (CIP), 
ceftazidime (CAZ), sulphazotrim (SUT), amikacin 
(AMI), 
chloramphenicol 
(CLO),  ampicillin  (AMP),  tobramycin  (TOB), 
cefoxitin  (CFO),  ceftriaxone  (CRO),  cefotaxime 
(CTX),  tetracycline  (TET),  amoxicillin  (AMO) 
and  amoxicillin  +  clavulanate  (AMC),  imipenem 
(IMP),  meropenem  (MER),  norfloxacin  (NOR), 
and nalidixic acid (NAL). As the bacterial samples 
were  isolated  from  animals,  enrofloxacin  (ENO) 
and  ceftiofur  (CEF)  sensitivity  was  also  tested, 
since  they  are  antimicrobial  drugs  exclusively  for 
veterinarian use. 

Phenotypic  tests  for  detection  of  ESBL-producing 
strains

The  double-disk  synergy  test  was  performed 
to  detect  ESBL-producing  strains.  Briefly,  disks 
containing  CTX,  CAZ,  CRO,  and  ATM  were 
distributed  at  a  20  mm-distance  from  a  disk 
containing  AMC  (20/10  μg).  Any  increase  or 
distortion  in  the  zone  of  inhibition  for  one  of  the 
antibiotics towards the AMC disk was considered as 
suggestive for ESBL production (BRUN-BUISSON 
et al., 1987).

Results and Discussion

Analysis  of  the  81  isolated  swabs  led  to  the 
identification of four (5.00%; 4/81 swabs) bacterial 
isolates resistant to beta-lactams and/or quinolone 
antibiotic drugs. Among these isolates, three (75%) 
were from sheep and one (25%) was from a dog.

Strains  resistant 

to  beta-lactam  antibiotics 
alone were identified in 1.25% (1/81 swabs) of the 
animals studied. Resistance only to quinolones was 
observed in 2.50% (2/81 swabs) and resistance to 
beta-lactams  associated  with  quinolone  resistance 
was seen in 1.25% (1/81) of the animals studied.

One  (3.20%;  1/31  swabs)  ESBL-producing 
Escherichia  coli  was  detected  in  the  oral  cavity 
swabs  of  dogs,  and  its  resistance  profile  was 
confirmed by the double-disk synergic test and the 
detection of blaCTX-M-15 and blaTEM via PCR (Figure 
1A and Table 2). 

In swabs collected from sheep, two Escherichia 
coli  (4.0%;  2/50  swabs)  strains  resistant  to  all 
quinolones  tested  were  identified.  Both  bacteria 
were isolated from female sheep and qnr genes were 
detected  in  PCR  analysis,  confirming  the  profile 
found in the antibiogram (Table 2).

resistance  was  determined 

in  one 
Morganella  morganii  strain  (2.0%;  1/50  swabs) 
isolated  from  a  male  sheep,  as  confirmed  by  the 
presence  of  the  blaCTX-M-2  gene  detected  by  PCR. 
Other  resistance  genes  were  also  identified  in  the 
same isolate, including the genes blaCMY-2 and qnrA, 
granting AmpC-producing ability and PMQR to this 
strain (Figure 1B and Table 2). 

The  results  of  all  the  tests  performed,  as 
well  as  the  resistance  profiles  obtained  through 
antibiograms, are depicted in Figures 1 and 2 and 
described in Table 2.

The  current  antibiotic-therapy  crisis  has  raised 
the need to generate public policies on the rational 
use of antibacterial drugs. Unfortunately, in Brazil, 
such actions have been directed mainly towards the 
use  of  antibiotics  in  human  medicine.  There  still 
remain  several  discrepancies  in  the  veterinarian 
sector, probably due to the lack of information on 
the impact of using antibacterial drugs in this area, 
as well as due to the lack of epidemiological studies 
that could provide panoramic insights into bacterial 
resistance  in  the  residing  microbiota  in  pets  and 
production animals.

Phenotypic  and  genotypic  tools  such  as  the 
antibiogram  and  PCR,  allow  the  monitoring  of 
the  dissemination  of  resistance  determinants, 

identifying sources and animal housing multidrug-
resistant bacteria that can be transferred to human 
beings,  the  environment  or  other  animals.  The 
presence  of  gram-negative  bacilli  carrying  ESBL 
genes  in  pets  and  production  animals  has  been 
reported in several studies. However, these studies 
are limited in Brazil, especially on the oral cavity of 
pets, as current research has mainly focused on the 
analysis of feces and urine samples (MORENO et 
al., 2008; MA et al., 2009, 2012).

Some  studies  have  detected  high  isolation 
frequencies of ESBL-producing E. coli in pets and 
production animals (MORENO et al., 2008; MA et 
al.,  2009,  2012).  The  isolates  harbored  blaCTX-M-1, 
blaCTX-M-2,  blaCTX-M-8  or  blaCTX-M-15  genes  and,  in 
some cases, a single strain presented more than one 
type of ESBL gene, with the presence of blaCTX-like 
associated with other ESBL genes, such as blaTEM 
(MORENO et al., 2008). 

A  study  performed  by  Moreno  et  al.  (2008) 
identified  a  20%  prevalence  of  ESBL-producing 
strains  in  feces  and  urine  from  pets.  A  few 
isolates  presented  more  than  one  ESBL  variant. 
This  paper  presents  alarming  data  on  beta-lactam 
antibiotic-resistant  strains  in  pets,  with  the  threat 
of dissemination of such multidrug-resistant strains 
via the feces of these animals into the environment 
they live in.

Semina: Ciências Agrárias, Londrina, v. 37, n. 2, p. 829-840, mar./abr. 2016Detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases and resistance in members of the Enterobacteriaceae family isolated ...from 

Phenotypic  and  genotypic  data 

the 
isolates found in the work of Moreno et al. (2008) 
corroborate the results of the present study, as the 
E. coli (P1C4) strain isolated from the oral cavity 
of dogs presented the blaCTX-M-15 and blaTEM genes. 
On  the  other  hand,  the  low  isolation  frequency 
suggests that such a bacterium may be present only 
transitorily in the oral cavity of dogs.

Nevertheless,  the  presence  of  ESBL-producing 
E. coli found in a dog oral sample indicates a high 
risk of contamination between animals and humans, 
since  there  is  frequent  contact  with  dog  saliva. 
Moreover,  as  these  animals  were  living  in  rural 
properties,  they  may  acquire  these  strains  from 
other animals or even human beings, as described 
by  Moura  et  al.  (2009),  who  studied  the  crossed-
transmission of enterobacteria between humans and 
pets.

Along  with  beta-lactam  antibiotics,  quinolones 
are also used for therapeutic purposes, prophylaxis 
or  growth  promotion 
in  animal  production 
environments  (AARESTRUP,  2005).  Abuse  in 
their  use  has  led  to  selection  and  development  of 
quinolone-resistant  bacteria,  compromising 
the 
treatment  of  infectious  diseases  in  these  animals 
(AARESTRUP, 2005; GIBBS et al., 2006; MA et 
al., 2009; HERRERA-LEÓN et al., 2011).

Several studies have shown the emergence and 
dissemination of PMQR in enterobacteria isolated 
from  pets,  production  and  wild  animals  (LIU  et 
al.,  2008;  HUANG  et  al.,  2009;  MA  et  al.,  2009; 
POMBA et al., 2009; ASAI et al., 2010; GIBSON et 
al., 2010a, 2010b; FORTINI et al., 2011). These data 
indicate that these animals are an important reservoir 
for  PMQR-resistance  genes  and  they  can  act  as 
possible transmission vectors for human beings, the 
environment and other animals (ROBICSEK et al., 
2006a; GIBBS et al., 2006; HAWKEY et al., 2009).
Quinolone resistance attributed to the presence 
of qnr genes was detected in 2.50% (2/81 swabs) of 
sheep and dogs studied, and E. coli was isolated in 
both cases. Genes qnrA and qnrD were identified in 

836

these two strains, with one of them presenting the 
two subtypes.

indicate  a

low  prevalence  of 
quinolone  resistance.  However, 
the  resistance 
profile in enterobacteria isolated from pets is similar 
to the profile of quinolone-resistant enterobacteria 
isolated  from  humans,  indicating  that  animal-
human-environment  cross-transmission  relations 
are possible (POMBA et al., 2009; FERREIRA et 
al., 2010a, 2010b; ANTUNES et al., 2011).

Quinolone-resistant  genes  have  been  identified 
in  enterobacteria  isolated  from  different  animal 
species,  including  commensal  microbiota  of  pets 
and  production  animals,  suggesting  that  these 
animals are important reservoirs  for  such  bacteria 
(NOVAIS et al., 2005; MACHADO et al., 2008). 

Additionally,  an  association  between  qnr  and 
ESBL production in single enterobacteria has been 
reported  in  a  few  studies  (POMBA  et  al.,  2009). 
The  present  study  has  identified  a  M.  morganii 
strain  producing  ESBL,  AmpC  and  resistance  to 
quinolones isolated from the rectal cavity of a male 
sheep,  with  its  phenotypic  and  genotypic  profile, 
corroborating  results  from  studies  performed  in 
humans,  pets  and  production  animals  around  the 
world. AmpC production was confirmed by means 
of the antibiogram profile and by the detection of 
the blaCMY-2 gene through PCR. The presence of this 
gene enables this strain to be resistant to AMC, as 
AmpC-type beta-lactamase producing bacteria can 
inhibit the action of clavulanate (MACHADO et al., 
2006; TOUATI et al., 2008; MINARINI et al., 2008; 
CRÉMET  et  al.,  2011;  PANIAGUA  et  al.,  2010; 
HUANG et al., 2009; MAHROUKI et al., 2013).

Importantly,  all  resistance  determinants  found 
in the studied strains are coded by mobile genetic 
elements,  easing 
these 
resistance genes among strains of the same species, 
as  well  as  among  different  species  within  the 
microbiota of an animal.

This  study  suggests  a  possibility  of  direct 
and/or  indirect  transmission  of  resistant  bacteria 
through  human-animal  contact,  as  well  as  their 
transmission  to  the  environment,  as  the  bacteria 
isolated from animals and human beings present the 
same phenotypic and genotypic profiles. The results 
underscore  the  need  for  further  molecular  studies 
to  characterize  the  genes  coding  for  the  acquired 
resistance  to  quinolones  in  other  environmental 
niches,  detect  the  emergence  of  new  resistance 
genes  and  monitor  their  dissemination  among 
different  bacteria  and  environmental  niches.  Only 
then  will  it  be  possible  to  design  and  implement 
efficient  measures  to  control  the  dissemination  of 
multi-resistant bacteria (including animal to human 
transmission)  and  minimize  the  risk  for  human 
health.
