Four   studies   were   performed   to  quantify   milk   production,   quality   and   consumption   in   the   town   Jimma,
Ethiopia.   First,   47  dairy   farmers   and   44   milk   retailers   were   interviewed   to   gain   more   insights   in  dairy
farming   and   marketing,   and   associated   constraints.   Second,   bulk   milk   samples   (n   =   188)   were   collected
for  4  consecutive   weeks   to   investigate   milk   quality   [Total   Bacterial   Counts   (TBC),   Coliform   Counts   (CC),
Somatic   Cell   Counts   (SCC),   and  antimicrobial   residues].   Third,   (bulk)   milk   samples   from   32  farms,   46   milk
retailers   and   the   3  local   milk   collection   centers   were   collected   to  determine   the   presence   of  oxacillin
susceptible–and   oxacillin   resistant   Staphylococcus   aureus.   Fourth,   208   adult   inhabitants   were   interviewed
to   gain   more   insight   in   milk   consumption   and   associated   concerns   of  consumers.   The   average   dairy   farm
included   in   the   studies   consisted   of  5  lactating   cows,   produced   43   liters   of   milk   per   day   and   was   owned
by   male,   literate   adults.   Milk   was   sold   to  retailers   (71%   of   the  production)   and   directly   to   customers
(25%)   without   any   quality   control,   whereas   4%   was   self-consumed.   Shortage   of   animal   nutrition   and
adulteration   of  the   milk   were   the   main   constraints   for   farmers   and   retailers,   respectively.   The   median
TBC,   CC   and   SCC   were   122,500   CFU/mL,   1,005   CFU/mL   and   609,500   cells/mL,   respectively.   Antimicrobial
residues   were   detected   in   20%   of  all   samples.   In  general,   the   milk   quality   was   considered   to   be  poor
(TBC   >   10,000   CFU/mL,   and/or   CC   >  100   CFU/mL,   and/or   SCC   >  400,000   cells/mL   and/or   presence   of   antimi-
crobial   residues)   in   97%   of  all   samples.   S.  aureus   was   isolated   from   12   (38%),   13   (33%),   and   2  out   of   3   of
the   milk   samples   originating   from   the   dairy   farms,   the   milk   retailers,   and   the   milk   collection   centers,
respectively.   Seven   (26%)   of  the   isolates   were   resistant   to  oxacillin   suggesting   the  presence   of   MRSA   (Lee,
2003).  Local   milk   is  occasionally   consumed   by   adults   but   more   frequently   by   children.   Adults   mainly
drink   spontaneously   fermented   milk   (57%   of   105   interviewees   consuming   local   milk)   whereas   most   milk
for  children   is   boiled   (86%   of   110   households   with   children   consuming   local   milk).   Most   consumers   are
concerned   about   adulteration   and   milk   borne   diseases   but   not   about   antimicrobial   residues.   Educated
consumers   (secondary   school   or   higher)   were   more   likely   to   boil   milk   for   own   consumption,   to  be   con-
cerned   about   antimicrobial   residues   in  milk,   to  be  concerned   about   milk   borne   diseases   and   to   be  willing
to   pay   more   for   milk   with   proven   good   quality   compared   to   poorly   educated   consumers.

We   conclude   that   milk   quality   incentives   should   be  introduced   in   Jimma,   and   investments   should   be

made   in  knowledge   transfer,   training,   milk   collection   systems   and   a  central   milk   quality   lab.

1.  Introduction

The  demand  for  milk  in  cities  of  developing  countries  increases
due  to  population  growth  and  urbanization  (Narrod  et  al.,  2011).  In
response,  smallholder  dairy  farms  are  mushrooming  in  e.g.  Jimma

and  other  Ethiopian  towns  (Mekonnen  et  al.,  2006).  Typically,
Holstein–Zebu  crossbreed  dairy  cows  are  milked  with  limited  or
no  access  to  pasture  (Tolosa  et  al.,  2013).  The  smallholders  are
responsible  for  98%  of  the  milk  produced.  The  milk  ﬂow  and  supply
chain  in  Ethiopia  is  quite  complex  and  in  many  cases  still  immature
in  terms  of  capacity,  organization  and  infrastructure  (Yilma  et  al.,
2011).  Only  a  limited  proportion  of  the  milk  is  bought  and  sold  by
the  3  local  milk  collection  centers  that  have  been  established  by  the
dairy  cooperatives  in  Jimma   in  2011.  Most  the  milk  is  directly  sold

10

to  retailers  and/or  consumers,  most  often  in  producer-owned  milk
shops.

Intramammary  infections  (IMI)  lead  to  an  increase  in  somatic
cell  count  (SCC),  (in)  directly  affecting  milk  shelf-life  and  com-
ponents  (Ma   et  al.,  2000).  High-quality  milk  has  a  low  SCC  and
bacteria  count,  and  is  free  of  foodborne  pathogens  and  antimi-
crobial  residues  (Oliver  et  al.,  2009).  Although  milk  has  a  high
nutritional  value  (Gaucheron,  2011),  it  constitutes  a  good  growth
medium  for  bacteria  of  which  some  are  pathogenic  for  humans
(Jayarao  and  Henning,  2001).  Bacteria  in  milk  originate  from  shed-
ding  cows  with  IMI,  unclean  milking  practices  or  improper  milk
handling  (Hayes  et  al.,  2001;  Zadoks  et  al.,  2004).  Among  other
pathogens  in  milk,  Staphylococcus  aureus  can  cause  severe  disease
in  humans,  and  is  difﬁcult  to  treat  in  case  of  the  presence  of  antimi-
crobial  resistance  (Xu  et  al.,  2014).  Accurate  information  on  milk
quality  in  Jimma   and  the  whole  of  Ethiopia  is  scarce.

Western  consumers  are  highly  concerned  about  the  quality  of
milk  and  other  animal  products  (Aumaître,  1999;  Noordhuizen
and  Metz,  2005).  Whether  consumers  in  African  cities  such  as
Jimma   share  this  concern  is  largely  unknown.  The  risk  of  milkborne
diseases  does  not  only  depend  on  microbiological  characteristics
but  also  on  milk  processing  before  consumption  (Lejeune  and
Rajala-Schultz,  2009).  In  Ethiopia,  milk  is  often  not  pasteurized  but
consumed  after  spontaneous  fermentation  at  the  household  level
(Gonfa  et  al.,  2001).  Spontaneous  fermentation  helps  in  extending
the  storage  life  of  the  milk.  During  the  spontaneous  fermentation,
the  lactic  acid  bacteria  present  in  the  raw  milk  convert  the  lac-
tose  into  lactic  acid,  lowering  the  pH  of  the  milk  and  thus  resulting
in  a  reduced  bacterial  count.  Some  of  the  lactic  acid  bacteria  also
produce  bacteriocins  that  inhibit  the  growth  of  disease-causing
pathogens  (Gillor  et  al.,  2008).  Yet,  the  frequency  and  type  of  milk
consumed  by  adults  and  children,  being  more  susceptible  to  milk
borne  diseases,  is  unknown  in  cities  such  as  Jimma.

The  objectives  of  this  research  were  to  characterize  dairy  farm-
ing  and  marketing,  to  study  milk  quality,  to  detect  the  presence  of
(oxacillin  resistant)  S.  aureus  in  raw  (bulk)  milk  and  to  quantify  milk
consumption  in  Jimma,  Ethiopia.

2.  Materials  and  methods

2.1.  Study  area

Jimma   is  a  medium-sized  town  with  approximately  140,000
inhabitants  located  in  Oromia  Regional  State,  Jimma  Zone,  352  km
South-West  of  the  capital,  Addis  Ababa  in  Ethiopia.  Jimma   has  an
altitude  of  about  1780  m  above  the  sea  level  and  an  annual  rain-
fall  ranging  from  1400  to  1900  mm.   Temperature  varies  between
6 ◦C  and  31 ◦C  (Alemu  et  al.,  2011).  The  area  is  mainly  known  for  its
coffee  production  but  crop  and  livestock  production  are  important
agricultural  activities  as  well.

2.2.  Questionnaire  on  dairy  farming,  milk  production  and
marketing

As  (dairy)  farmers  and  retailers  are  not  registered  in  Ethiopia,
their  exact  total  number  is  unknown,  also  in  Jimma.  Yet,  47  small-
holder  dairy  farmers  and  44  milk  retailers  were  selected  based
on  their  willingness  to  cooperate,  encompassing  a  large  major-
ity  of  those  present  in  Jimma   (total  number  estimated  at  60).  All
were  interviewed  face-to-face  by  the  ﬁrst  author  between  July  and
August  2009.  Closed  and  open  questions  were  asked  to  gain  more
insight  in  dairy  farming  and  marketing,  and  associated  constraints
(Table  1).

In  all  47  herds,  different  types  of  antimicrobials  were  used  to
treat  sick  animal  against  different  infectious  diseases  including
mastitis.  With  a  cow  level  prevalence  of  clinical  and  subclinical
mastitis  of  11  and  62%,  respectively,  and  a  blind  quarter  prevalence
of  6%,  mastitis  is  one  of  the  most  common  infectious  diseases
for  which  antimicrobials  are  used  (Tolosa  et  al.,  2013;  Tolosa
et  al.,  2015).  All  except  from  one  herd  used  Lactaclox® (i.e.,  a
combination  of  ampicillin  and  loxacillin)  for  the  intramammary
treatment  of  mastitis.  Sixteen  (34%),  13  (28%),  10  (21%),  and  8
(17%)  herds  used  Lactaclox® and  oxytetracycline,  Lactaclox®,
Lactaclox®,oxytetracycline 
and
Lactaclox® and  penicillin–streptomycin,  respectively.  On  54%  of
the  herds,  antimicrobials  and  other  drugs  used  for  the  treatment
of  diseases  were  prescribed  and  administered  by  a  veterinarian
on  the  herd,  on  24%  of  the  participating  herds  sick  animals  were
treated  at  a  veterinary  clinic  in  the  neighbourhood  and  22%  of
the  farmers  treated  their  animals  themselves  based  on  their  own
experiences.  Animals  suffering  from  clinical  mastitis  are  treated
for  a  maximum  of  3  consecutive  days.  No  precise  information  was
available  on  the  treatment  strategies  applied  for  other  diseases
than  mastitis.

and  penicillin–streptomycin, 

2.3.  Longitudinal  study  on  milk  quality

Bulk  milk  samples  of  the  aforementioned  dairy  farms  were  asep-
tically  collected  once  a  week  for  four  consecutive  times  between
December  2009  and  January  2010.  For  the  enumeration  of  TBC
and  CC,  serial  dilutions  (10−1,10−2,  10−3 and  10−4)  were  plated  on
Petriﬁlm  Aerobic  Count  Plates  (3  M,   Saint  Paul,  MN,   US)  and  Petri-
ﬁlm  Coliform  Count  Plates  (3  M,   Saint  Paul,  MN,   US)   according  to
the  manufacturer’s  instructions.  After  24  h  of  incubation  at  37 ◦C,
plates  were  read  using  a  semi-automated  colony  counter  (Stuart,
Bibby  Sterilin,  Stone,  UK).  The  SCC  was  measured  with  a  DeLaval
Direct  Cell  Counter  (DeLaval,  Tumba,  Sweden).  The  Copan  Milk  Test
(Copan  Italia,  Brescia,  Italy)  was   used  to  determine  the  presence  or
absence  of  antimicrobial  residues  in  the  milk  samples  according  to
the  manufacturer’s  instructions.

2.4.  Cross-sectional  study  on  Staphylococcus  aureus  occurrence
and  oxacillin  resistance

Additional  bulk  milk  samples  were  aseptically  collected
between  October  2012  and  May   2013  to  determine  the  occurrence
of  oxacillin  resistant  and  susceptible  S.  aureus.   Besides  32  of  the
aforementioned  47  dairy  farms  (conveniently  selected),  samples
were  collected  at  46  milk  retailers  and  the  3  milk  collection  cen-
␮L  of  milk  was  plated  on
ters  established  in  Jimma   in  2011.  Ten 
blood-esculin  agar  and  incubated  aerobically  for  24–48  h  at  35 ◦C
(National  Mastitis  and  Council,  1999).  Round  colonies  with  hemoly-
sis  were  transferred  to  a  new  plate.  They  were  identiﬁed  as  S.  aureus
or  other  bacteria  based  on  Gram-staining,  a  catalase  test,  growth
on  mannitol  salt  agar,  a  DNase  test,  a  coagulase  test  and  polymyxin
susceptibility.  Subsequently,  Oxacillin  Resistance  Screening  Agar
Base  (ORSAB,  Oxoid,  Basingstoke,  England)  was   used  to  test  for
oxacillin  resistance  (Simor  et  al.,  2001).

milk  collection  centers  that  are  currently  buying  and  selling  a  lim-
ited  proportion  of  the  produced  milk.  The  milk  collection  centers
test  sourness  and  adulteration  of  milk  using  an  alcohol  test  and  a
lactometer.  Quality  of  milk  sold  to  retailers  or  directly  to  customers
is,  however,  not  tested  in  Jimma.  Farmers  received  an  average  of
6.1  Ethiopian  Birr  (1  Ethiopian  Birr  =  0.05  $)  per  liter  (range  4–8)
whereas  the  milk  retailers  charged  12.7  Ethiopian  Birr  per  liter
(range  8–21).  Forty-four  (94%)  of  the  farmers  were  concerned  about
the  presence  of  antimicrobial  residues  in  milk  whereas  only  8  (18%)
of  the  milk  retailers  were.  All  dairy  farmers  and  41  (93%)  milk  retail-
ers  were  concerned  about  the  milk  quality  and  all  were  interested
in  the  establishment  of  a  central  milk  quality  lab.  Low  demand  of
milk  during  fasting  (30%),  shortage  of  animal  nutrition  (23%)  and
low  milk  price  (15%)  were  the  main  constraints  for  the  dairy  farm-
ers  whereas  adulteration  and  poor  quality  of  supplied  milk  (23  and
20%,  respectively)  were  the  main  constraints  for  the  milk  retailers
(Table  3).

␣/2pq/L2 = 1.96䊐×0.50×0.50
  Z2

A  total  of  208  adult  inhabitants  of  Jimma   were  interviewed  using
closed  questions  (Table  2)  on  milk  consumption,  using  systemic
sampling  at  every  10th  house  in  the  main,  secondary  and  tertiary
roads  in  Jimma.  The  sample  size  was  estimated  using  the  following
=
formula  (Dohoo  et  al.,  2003): 
  96
with  n  being  the  number  of  consumers  needed  to  estimate  the  con-
cern  for  milk  quality  (a  major  research  question),  Z␣/2 being  the
95th  percentile  of  a  standard  normal  distribution,  p  being  a  pri-
ori  estimate  of  the  proportion  of  consumers  concerned  about  milk
quality  intuitively  set  at  0.5,  q  being  1–p,  and  L  being  the  margin  of
error  set  at  0.1.  As  half  of  the  inhabitants  were  expected  to  regu-
larly  buy  milk,  the  number  of  interviewees  was  doubled.  Age  of  the
interviewee  was  recorded.

0.12

 

2.6.  Statistical  analysis

Descriptive  statistics  were  calculated  using  Microsoft  Excel
2010 
(Microsoft  Corporation,  Redmond,  Washington,  USA).
Because  TBC  and  CC  were  not  normally  distributed,  the  median,
interquartile  range  (IQR)  and  number  of  measurements  above
thresholds  as  suggested  by  Jayarao  et  al.  (2004)  were  calculated.

Associations  between  educational  level  of  the  consumer  (sec-
ondary  school  or  higher  vs.  elementary  school  or  lower)  and
answers  to  the  questions  on  milk  consumption  were  analysed  with
SAS  9.4  (SAS  Institute  Inc.,  NC,  USA).  Because  of  low  frequencies
in  some  cells,  exact  logistic  regression  models  were  ﬁt.  Answers
to  the  questions  “How  often  do  you(r  children)  drink  local  milk?”
were  categorized  as  daily  or  weekly  vs.  less  often  and  “How  do
you(r  children)  drink  local  milk?”  as  boiled  vs.  raw  or  fermented.
Odds  ratio’s  (OR)  and  95%  conﬁdence  intervals  (CI)  of  the  signiﬁcant
associations  are  reported.

3.  Results

3.1.  Questionnaire  on  dairy  farming,  milk  production  and
marketing

The  interviewed  dairy  farmers  were  on  average  45  years  old
(range  15–68).  Thirty-ﬁve  (74%)  were  male  and  30  (64%)  ﬁnished
secondary  school.  Average  herd  size  was  5  lactating  cows  (range
1–23),  producing  on  average  43  liters  of  milk  per  day  (range  9–203)
on  herd  level.  Four%  of  the  produced  milk  was  self-consumed,
71%  was  sold  to  milk  retailers,  and  25%  was  sold  directly  to  cus-
tomers.  In  2011,  the  Jimma   town  dairy  cooperative  established  3

(range 

300,000–1,003,000), 

The  median  TBC,  CC 

and  SCC  were  122,500  CFU/mL
(IQR  0–22,750)  and
(IQR  12,700–2,850,000),  1,005  CFU/mL 
609,500  cells/mL 
respectively.
Antimicrobial  residues  were  detected 
(20%)
and  on  26  farms  (55%).  The  milk  quality  was  considered  to
be  poor  (TBC  >  10,000  CFU/mL  and/or  CC  >  100  CFU/mL  and/or
SCC  >  400,000  cells/mL  and/or  antimicrobial  residues)  in  182  of
the  total  number  of  samples  (97%).  The  proportion  of  herds  with
0,  1,  2,  3  or  4  milk  samples  exceeding  milk  quality  thresholds  are
presented  in  Table  4.

in  38  samples 

3.3.  Cross-sectional  study  on  Staphylococcus  aureus  occurrence
and  oxacillin  resistance

S.  aureus  was  isolated  from  12  (38%)  of  the  milk  samples  taken
from  the  dairy  farms,  13  (33%)  of  the  samples  taken  at  the  milk
retailers  and  2  of  the  3  samples  taken  from  the  milk  collection  cen-
ters.  Seven  (26%)  of  the  isolates  were  resistant  to  oxacillin  (3  from
dairy  farms  and  4  from  retailers).

3.4.  Questionnaire  on  milk  consumption  and  associated  concerns
of  consumers

The  interviewees  were  on  average  37  years  old  (range  18–80).
Eighty-two  (39%)  were  male  and  148  (71%)  ﬁnished  secondary
school.  Of  the  105  interviewees  consuming  local  milk  daily  or
weekly,  11,  57  and  31%  mainly  consumed  raw,  fermented  and
boiled  milk,  respectively.  Of  the  145  interviewees  having  children
below  the  age  of  10,  110  gave  local  milk  to  their  children  daily  or
weekly.  In  4,  11  and  86%  of  the  households,  children  mainly  con-
sumed  raw,  fermented  and  boiled  milk,  respectively.  Of  the  150
interviewees  drinking  milk  daily  or  weekly  and/or  having  children
below  age  10  drinking  milk  daily  or  weekly,  87,  16,  84  and  76%
were  concerned  about  milk  quality,  antimicrobial  residues,  adul-
teration  and  milk  borne  diseases,  respectively.  Eighty-nine%  would
pay  more  for  milk  with  proven  good  quality  (Table  2).  Educated  con-
sumers  (secondary  school  or  higher)  were  more  likely  to  boil  milk

4.  Discussion

T.  Tolosa  et  al.  /  Preventive  Veterinary  Medicine  124  (2016)  9–14

Four  studies  were  performed  to  gain  more  insights  in  dairy  farm-
ing  and  milk  quality  in  Jimma   (Ethiopia).  Unfortunately,  as  farms
are  not  registered  and  the  total  number  of  dairy  farms  in  Jimma  is
unknown,  we  cannot  be  sure  the  sample  is  fully  representative.  Yet,
we  believe  a  large  majority  of  farmers  has  been  included.

The  majority  of  farmers  in  Jimma   is  literate,  male  elders.
Although  dairy  herds  are  relatively  small,  employees  milk  the  cows
rather  than  the  owners  (Tolosa  et  al.,  2013).  The  milk  chain  in
Jimma   is  decentralized  with  limited  to  no  quality  control,  which
is  clearly  reﬂected  in  the  milk  quality  results.  Surprisingly,  most
farmers  but  few  retailers  declared  to  be  concerned  about  antimi-
crobial  residues.  Yet,  milk  adulteration  and  poor  milk  quality  were
identiﬁed  as  the  main  constraints  faced  by  retailers  demonstrating
the  need  for  more  milk  quality  control  in  Jimma.  On-farm  testing

of  the  milk  composition  via  a  lactometer  or  measuring  the  freezing
point  via  a  cryoscope  before  the  milk  is  sold  to  the  retailers  and/or
customers  would  certainly  lower  the  prevalence  of  adulteration
though  is  at  this  moment  not  realistic  due  to  a  lack  of  infrastructure
and  resources.

Milk  quality  was  found  to  be  very  poor  in  Jimma.  The  high  TBC
and  CC  suggest  unhygienic  practice  around  milking  whereas  imple-
mentation  of  hygienic  measurements  such  as  proper  cleaning  and
disinfection  of  the  milk  containers  and  cooling  throughout  the  milk
chain  could  help  to  improve  the  milk  quality  (Bonfoh  et  al.,  2006).
The  availability  of  a  range  of  high  quality  branded  pre-milking  and
post-milking  teat  dips  would  make  a  signiﬁcant  difference.  Also,
some  farmers  do  have  electricity  which  could  be  used  to  run  a
small  bulk  milk  tank,  though  these  are  the  exceptions.  Some  try
to  keep  the  milk  cool  after  milking  by  placing  the  milk  bucket  or
churn  in  water  in  an  attempt  to  ensure  the  milk  does  not  spoil.

Of  course,  particularly  in  the  heat  of  the  summer  this  is  less  likely
to  be  successful  in  keeping  the  bacterial  growth  low  enough.  The
high  SCC  is  in  accordance  with  the  previously  reported  high  preva-
lence  of  subclinical  mastitis  in  Jimma   (Tolosa  et  al.,  2013  and  2015).
Although,  most  farmers  declared  to  be  concerned  about  antimicro-
bial  residues,  20%  of  the  bulk  milk  samples  and  more  than  half  of  the
farms  tested  positive  indicating  many  farmers  do  not  respect  with-
drawal  times,  or  are  not  aware  of  the  concept.  As  the  Copan  Milk
Test  has  a  low  sensitivity  for  certain  antimicrobials  (Le  Breton  et  al.,
2007)  and  farmers  were  aware  of  the  sampling  taking  place,  the
actual  occurrence  of  antimicrobial  residues  might  be  even  higher.
Routine  antimicrobial  testing  of  the  milk  is  not  realistic  due  to  costs
and  time.  The  often  small  volumes  of  milk  do  generally  not  add  up
the  economics  of  carrying  out  such  antimicrobial  residue  tests.  Still,
the  risk  of  residue  failures  can  be  drastically  minimized  by  a  good
identiﬁcation  and  marking  of  all  treated  cows  before  treatment  is
administered,  by  the  use  of  a  standardized  treatment  protocol,  and
by  milking  all  treated  cows  last  or  separately.  Providing  a  written
guide  on  how  to  avoid  antimicrobial  residues  in  the  milk  on  every
dairy  farm  could  be  a  ﬁrst  step  towards  a  lower  number  of  residue
failures.  The  availability  of  a  range  of  licensed  veterinary  medicinal
products  could  also  make  it  easier  to  predict  and  respect  the  cor-
rect  withdrawal  period  and  thus  to  reduce  the  number  of  residue
failures.

Most  retailers  bought  milk  from  one  speciﬁc  farm,  most  likely
explaining  why  the  occurrence  of  S.  aureus  differed  little  between
samples  from  farms  (38%)  and  retailers  (33%).  A  similar  occurrence
of  S.  aureus  (43.5%)  was  reported  in  smallholder  dairy  farms  in
Debre  Zeit,  close  to  the  Ethiopian  capital  (Makita  et  al.,  2012).  A
relatively  high  proportion  of  isolates  was  resistant  to  oxacillin  sug-
gesting  the  presence  of  MRSA  (Lee,  2003).  Detection  of  enterotoxin
and  resistance  genes  could  increase  our  knowledge  on  the  risk  of
food  poisoning  and  resistance  mechanisms  (Silveira-Filho  et  al.,
2014)  and  remain  to  be  studied.

Children  consume  milk  more  often  than  adults.  Most  but  not  all
interviewees  declared  to  boil  milk  prior  to  giving  it  to  children.
Given  the  high  bacterial  load  in  the  milk  and  the  high  suscep-
tibility  of  children  to  milk  borne  diseases  (American  Academy
of  Pediatrics,  2014),  consumption  of  raw  milk  should  be  dis-
couraged  in  Jimma.  Many  adults  drink  spontaneously  fermented
milk.  Yet,  under  laboratory  conditions,  pathogens  such  as  Listeria
monocytogenes  and  Escherichia  coli  O157:H7  survived  spontaneous
fermentation  (Ashenaﬁ,  1994;  Tsegaye  and  Ashenaﬁ,  2005).  The
prevalence  of  the  latter  pathogens  in  spontaneously  fermented
milk  might  be  high  but  remains  to  be  studied.

Very  low  concentrations  of  antibiotics  can  select  for  antimi-
crobial  resistance  (Huttner  et  al.,  2013),  being  a  threat  for  global
health  (Gullberg  et  al.,  2011).  Similar  to  the  retailers,  few  of  the
consumers  were  concerned  about  antimicrobial  residues.  However,
the  high  concern  about  milk  adulteration  and  milk  borne  diseases
indicate  the  need  for  more  milk  quality  control.  As  many  consumers
were  willing  to  pay  more  for  milk  with  proven  high  quality,  pro-
ducers  could  beneﬁt  from  more  milk  quality  control.  Differences
with  highly  educated  consumers  indicate  a  lack  of  knowledge  on
the  risks  associated  with  antimicrobial  residues  and  milk  borne
diseases  in  poorly  educated  consumers.

5.  Conclusions

Jimma  has  a  decentralized  milk  chain  with  limited  to  no  quality
control.  Milk  quality  was  very  poor  in  all  47  sampled  farms.  S.  aureus
was  frequently  isolated  with  many  strains  showing  oxacillin  resis-
tance  suggesting  the  presence  of  MRSA.  The  majority  of  the  adults
drink  unpasteurized  milk  whereas  most  but  not  all  children  drink
pasteurized  milk.  Consumers  are  concerned  about  adulteration  and
milk  borne  diseases  but  not  about  antimicrobial  residues.  Based  on
the  results,  milk  quality  incentives  should  be  introduced  in  Jimma

14

and  efforts  should  be  put  in  awareness  programs  for  farmers  and
consumers.
