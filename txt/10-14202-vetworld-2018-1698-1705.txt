Abstract

Background  and Aim:  Campylobacteriosis  finds  its  place  among  the  four  important  global  foodborne  illnesses.  The 
disease, though self-limiting, needs antibacterial therapy in extraintestinal complications. Therefore, the present study was 
designed to estimate the prevalence of thermophilic Campylobacters in poultry, animals, and humans of the Kumaon region 
of Uttarakhand.
Materials and Methods: A total of 609 samples comprising of poultry ceca (n=116), poultry droppings (n=203), and feces 
of pigs (n=71), cattle (n=61), sheep (n=19), goat (n=17), human beings (n=88), and laboratory animals (n=34) (rats, rabbits, 
and guinea pigs) were collected. The thermophilic Campylobacters, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were 
confirmed using multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The isolates were also screened for the presence of virulence genes, 
and their antibiotic susceptibility testing was done against eight antibiotics.
Results: An  overall  prevalence  of  6.24%  was  revealed  with  highest  from  poultry  ceca  (15.52%),  followed  by  poultry 
droppings (5.91%), cattle feces (4.92%), human stools (3.40%), and pig feces (2.82%). The virulence genes, namely cadF, 
flaA, virB11, and pldA, were present in 38 (100%), 37 (97.37%), 7 (18.42%), and 14 (36.84%) isolates, respectively. All the 
isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid, while all were sensitive to erythromycin and co-trimoxazole.
Conclusion: It was concluded that the animals and humans in the region harbored the thermophilic Campylobacters which 
may contribute to the human illness. Resistance shown among the isolates may complicate the antimicrobial therapy.

Introduction

Infections  occurring  due  to  the  consumption 
of contaminated food are of a growing public health 
concern. These contaminated or unsafe foods pose a 
global threat affecting persons of all age groups. Food 
may get contaminated during any point of production 
and/or distribution by a number of microbes. Of all 
the food pathogens, Campylobacters have become a 
leading  cause  of  enteric  infections  in  both  develop-
ing  and  developed  countries.  The  Campylobacters 
have a broad animal reservoir. They are inhabitants of 
the intestinal tract of various domestic and wild ani-
mals, especially birds which are generally asymptom-
atic  carriers.  Therefore,  inadequately  cooked  meat, 
particularly  poultry,  contaminated  drinking  water, 
unpasteurized milk, ready to eat food products, fecal 
runoff of birds and domestic animals contaminating 
surface  water,  and  direct  contact  with  animals  act 
as  the  main  source  of  the  organism.  Contaminated

food  is  the  primary  mode  of  infection  with  poultry 
being the most common food source for humans [1]. 
Prevalence  of  Campylobacters  in  poultry  has  been 
reported by many authors [2-4]. In humans, the dis-
ease,  campylobacteriosis  is  characterized  by  bloody 
diarrhea, fever, severe abdominal pain, and headache. 
Fever  generally  persists  for  up  to  1  week  in  more 
than  90%  of  the  patients;  however,  50%  of  persons 
infected  with  Campylobacters  remain  asymptom-
atic [5]. It is a gastrointestinal disorder that generally 
affects  infants,  elderly  people,  and  immunocompro-
mised individuals. Most people suffering from cam-
pylobacteriosis  recover  within  2-5  days,  but  it  may 
take up to 10 days in some cases. A very small dose of 
500 cells may be infectious and sufficient to produce 
gastroenteritis.  Common  long-term  complications 
of  campylobacteriosis  are  Guillain-Barre  syndrome, 
inflammatory bowel disease, bacteremia, rheumatoid 
arthritis, along with local complications such as cho-
lecystitis,  pancreatitis,  peritonitis,  massive  gastroin-
testinal  hemorrhage,  thyroiditis,  and  prosthetic  joint 
infection. Over 2.4 million persons annually or 0.8% 
of the total population [6] are affected making it a very 
important  organism  from  a  socioeconomic  perspec-
tive. However, many of the cases go undiagnosed. The 
disease has a long back existence, and its recognition 
as a common infection is owed to improved laboratory

improve the strategies for management as well as pre-
vention of the disease.

Molecular methods are useful in the identifica-
tion of thermophilic Campylobacters as they enhance 
the sensitivity and specificity of the detection process. 
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based species identi-
fication methods for Campylobacter spp. provide more 
reliable  identification.  Gorkiewicz  et  al.  [7]  recom-
mended 16SrRNA sequence analysis as an effective, 
reliable, and rapid procedure for the specific identifi-
cation of Campylobacters. Molecular techniques have 
come a long way in the characterization of microbes. 
Despite  higher  recovery  rates  of  Campylobacters 
as  foodborne  pathogens,  the  specific  virulence  and 
pathogenic mechanisms of Campylobacter spp. infec-
tion is still poorly understood. The putative virulence 
factor for adhesion (cadF, dnaJ, jlpA, pldA, racR, and 
virB11) and invasion of epithelial cells (iamA, ciaB, 
and  ceuE),  toxin  production  (cdtA,  cdtB,  cdtC,  and 
wlaN), and flagellar motility (flaA, flaB, flhA, flhB, 
flgB, flgE2, fliM, and fliY) are thought to be important 
virulence mechanisms. Different studies in this regard 
have  indicated  the  role  of  different  virulence  mark-
ers  for  adherence,  invasion,  and  colonization  of  the 
organism in humans and animals. These virulence-re-
lated factors contribute to survival and establishment 
of the disease in host, thus modulating the clinical pre-
sentation of the disease. Antimicrobial agents are used 
for the early recovery of extraintestinal infections in 
immunocompromised  patients  or  whenever  clinical 
therapy is needed. The emergence of antimicrobial-re-
sistant (AMR) Campylobacters has alerted toward the 
chances of increased invasive illness. The resistance 
has been linked to the illicit use of antimicrobials in 
animal  feeds,  food  animals,  and  flock  treatment  of 
animals.  Few  antibiotics  such  as  macrolides  (eryth-
romycin [ERY]) and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin 
[CIP]) used as drug of choice have shown resistance 
against Campylobacter spp. [8]. Newer antibiotics are 
being continuously added to the list every year.

The present study was, therefore, undertaken to 
characterize the isolated Campylobacters on the pres-
ence of virulence genes and the phenotypic antibiotic 
resistance.
Materials and Methods
Ethical approval

Samples were collected as per standard sample 

collection procedure.
Sample collection and processing

A  total  of  609  samples  comprising  of  poultry 
ceca (n=116), poultry droppings (n=203), and feces of 
pigs (n=71), cattle (n=61), sheep (n=19), goat (n=17), 
human beings (n=88), and laboratory animals (n=34) 
(rats,  rabbits,  and  guinea  pigs)  were  collected  from 
Uttarakhand state of India. Sterile 100 ml Whirl-Pak 
bags (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI) were used to collect 
the samples. The samples were collected aseptically and

agar 

immediately brought to the laboratory for processing 
as per previously published protocols [9,10].

In brief, the poultry ceca and poultry fecal sam-
ples  were  streaked  directly  onto  the  modified  char-
coal-cefoperazone-deoxycholate 
(mCCDA, 
HiMedia,  India)  plates  and  incubated  at  42Â°C  with 
5% CO2 in a CO2 incubator for 48 h [10]. However, 
human  and  other  animal  fecal  samples  (1  g)  were 
initially enriched in 9 ml Bolton Broth (Oxoid, UK) 
supplemented  with  5%  sheep  blood.  Thereafter,  a 
loopful of the enriched broth suspension was streaked 
onto mCCDA plates and was incubated at the same 
time-temperature  combination.  The  characteristic 
Campylobacter colonies (1-2 mm size, circular, flat to 
slightly raised, sticky, spreading, and shiny gray) were 
selected from each plate and tested biochemically.
Biochemical and molecular confirmation

All  the  presumptive  Campylobacter  isolates 
showing catalase and oxidase positive reaction while 
urease  and  TSI  negative  reaction  were  subjected 
to  DNA  isolation  using  Hi-PurA  genomic  DNA 
extraction kit (Hi-media).

A simplex PCR assay targeting the 16SrRNA [11] 
was  used  for  the  Campylobacter  genus  identifica-
tion. The primer sequence and the cyclic conditions 
were used as per Linton et al. [11] for Campylobacter 
genus.  All  PCR  confirmed  Campylobacter  isolates 
were stored as 20% glycerol stock at â80Â°C.
Multiplex PCR

Multiplex  PCR  was  carried  out  for  the  iden-
tification of genus as well as species of the isolates. 
Multiplex  PCR  included  amplification  of  cadF  gene 
for genus identification [12], whereas hipO gene [11] 
and asp gene [11] amplification for the identification of 
Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, respec-
tively. The primer sequence and the cyclic conditions 
were used as per Linton et al. [11] and Nayak et al. [12] 
for Campylobacter genus and species, respectively.
Detection of virulence genes

All  Campylobacter  isolates  were  screened  for 
the  presence  of  various  virulence  genes  by  PCR. 
Virulence genes screened were flaA [13], virB11 [14], 
and pldA [15]. PCR reaction and cycling conditions 
were used as described earlier in respective references.
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

The AMR profile of Campylobacter isolates was 
determined using standard Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion 
method as described by Taremi  et al. [16]. A  total of 
38 revived isolates were tested against a panel of eight 
antibiotics  that  included  ampicillin  (AMP,  10  Âµg), 
gentamicin (GEN, 10 Âµg), ERY (15 Âµg), levofloxacin 
(LE,  5  Âµg),  CIP  (5  Âµg),  nalidixic  acid  (NA,  30  Âµg), 
ceftriaxone  (CTR,  30  Âµg),  and  co-trimoxazole  (COT, 
25  Âµg)  (HiMedia).  The  isolates  were  revived  on 
mCCDA plates supplemented with FD009 supplement. 
The  growth  suspension  prepared  in Tryptic  soy  broth 
and compared with 0.5 McFarland standard was spread 
on Mueller-Hinton agar plates supplemented with 7%

5% CO2 tension for 24 h. Zone diameter was measured 
and breakpoints were interpreted based on the recom-
mendations  of  the  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards 
Institute standards for disc diffusion assay (CLSI 2016).
Results
Isolation and molecular confirmation

Of 609 samples (poultry ceca [n=116], poultry 
droppings  [n=203],  and  feces  of  pigs  [n=71],  cattle 
[n=61],  sheep  [n=19],  goat  [n=17],  human  beings 
[n=88], and laboratory animals [n=34]) screened, 38 
were confirmed as positive for Campylobacter yield-
ing a prevalence of 6.24%.

All the isolates produced a genus-specific ampli-
con of 816 bp in 16SrRNA Campylobacter genus-spe-
cific PCR (Figure-1).
Multiplex PCR for species identification

On  performing  the  multiplex  PCR,  all  the  38 
isolates  amplified  cadF  gene  and  produced  400  bp 
amplicon suggesting the isolates belonging to genus 
Campylobacter. C. coli and C. jejuni species targeting 
asp gene (500 bp) and hipO gene (735 bp), respec-
tively, were amplified in 29 (n=38) and 9 (n=38) iso-
lates revealing a prevalence of 76.32% and 23.68%, 
respectively (Figure-2).

Prevalence of Campylobacters among various sources
Of 609 samples screened, 38 were found pos-
itive  for  Campylobacter  spp.  with  a  prevalence  of 
6.24%. Of a total of 38 thermophilic Campylobacters 
detected,  9  (23.68%)  were  identified  as  C.  jejuni 
and  29  (76.32%)  as  C.  coli.  Highest  isolation  was 
recorded  from  poultry  ceca  (15.52%),  followed  by 
poultry  droppings  (5.91%),  cattle  feces  (4.92%), 
human  stools  (3.40%),  and  pig  feces  (2.82%). 
All  sheep,  goat,  and  laboratory  animal  fecal  sam-
ples  tested  were  negative  for  Campylobacter  spp. 
(Table-1).
Virulence typing

Virulence typing was performed using four genes 
as targets. The results suggested that cadF, virB11, and 
pldA genes were present in 38 (100%), 7 (18.42%), 
and 14 (36.84%) isolates, respectively (Figures-3-5). 
The second highest prevalence was found of flaA (fla-
gellar motility) gene that was amplified in 37(97.37%) 
isolates. A total of 7 isolates (18.42%), 5 of C. jejuni 
and 2 of C. coli, were found to express all the four vir-
ulent genes (cadF, flaA, virB11, and pldA) as shown 
in Tables-2 and 3.

ferent sources is shown in Tables-4 and 5. All iso-
lates (100%, n=38) were resistant to NA, while all

Discussion

Campylobacter is one of the leading causes of 
gastrointestinal  illnesses  worldwide.  The  present 
study was done to determine the prevalence of ther-
mophilic Campylobacters (C. jejuni and C. coli), their 
presence  of  virulence  genes,  and  the  antimicrobial 
susceptibility  of  the  obtained  isolates.  Of  609  sam-
ples  screened,  38  were  detected  to  be  positive  for 
Campylobacter  spp.  showing  the  overall  prevalence 
rate  to  be  6.24%.  The  findings  were  in  accordance 
with the work of Rajagunalan [17] and Pandey [18] 
who  accounted  6.9%  and  5.34%  prevalence  rate  of 
Campylobacter  spp.  in  the  same  area,  respectively. 
However, there are reports of a bit higher prevalence 
in the same study region 16% [19], 11.66% [20], and 
13.54%  [21],  and  the  reason  probably  could  be  the

variation in species of host, time and season of sample 
collection, and the difference in the sample source of 
various species. This study also showed that C. coli 
(29/38,  76.32%)  was  more  prevalent  than  C.  jejuni 
(9/38,  23.68%)  isolates  which  was  incorcondance 
with  Rajagunalan  [17]  and  Kumar  [20].  In  contrast 
to these findings, many workers including Rajendran 
et al. [22] and Deckert et al. [23] have reported the 
higher presence of C. jejuni than C. coli. The variation 
in the prevalence of C. jejuni and C. coli could be due 
to difference in the samples, animal species screened, 
and the geographical location of the study. The use of 
growth promoters and increased AMR in C. coli has 
also been reasoned for the variation [24].

Among different sample sources, the highest iso-
lation rate was observed from poultry ceca (15.52%), 
followed  by  poultry  droppings  (5.91%),  cattle  feces 
(4.92%), human stools (3.40%), and pig feces (2.82%). 
The observations were in agreement with the findings 
of Humphrey et al. [25], who observed that, other than 
poultry digestive tract, digestive tracts of cattle, pigs, 
and human beings also act as the significant reservoir 
for Campylobacter species. The isolation rate in poul-
try ceca was higher (15.52%) than poultry droppings 
(5.91%).  The  difference  could  be  because  organ-
isms undergo stress after excretion which may affect

its  survival  and  recovery  rate.  Moreover,  keeping 
period of a bird in a flock enhances the colonization 
of Campylobacters. The collection of fecal and cecal 
samples from the same bird might give a clear picture 
of the prevalence of the organism.

None of the isolates were recovered from sheep 
and goat feces. Low prevalence of Campylobacters in 
sheep and goat has been reported by Salihu et al. [26], 
Zweifel et al. [27], and Cortes et al. [28] who reported 
a very low prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in sheep 
and  goats  as  compared  to  other  animals. As  a  con-
tradiction to this finding, Lazou et al. [29], Mpalang 
et al. [30], and Karikari et al. [31] have recorded high 
prevalence  in  sheep  and  goat. The  fecal  samples  of 
laboratory animals also did not yield any isolate which 
was dissimilar to the findings of Jensen et al. [32] and 
Nkogwe et al. [33] who reported C. jejuni infection 
in rats. Our findings in case of sheep, goat, and labo-
ratory animals differed probably due to a lower num-
ber of samples screened. Moreover, better husbandry 
practices  [26]  followed  could  have  resulted  in  the 
absence  of  Campylobacters. The  laboratory  animals 
were kept in a strict hygienic environment separated 
from other animals in the medical as well as veterinary 
colleges which could be the reason for the absence of 
Campylobacter organism from these samples.

genes as targets. Of all the 38 isolates, all the isolates 
(100%) showed the presence of cadF genes. The other 
three  flaA,  virB11,  and  pldA  genes  were  present  in 
37 (97.37%), 7 (18.42%), and 14 (36.84%) isolates, 
respectively.

The  cadF  and  flaA  genes  responsible  for  the 
expression of adherence and colonization were highly 
detectable in all the isolates. The presence of cadF gene 
highly conserved in Campylobacters and regarded as 
genus-specific has been reported by Konkel et al. [34] 
and Wieczorek et al. [35]. This protein is important 
for  full  binding  capacity  of  the  Campylobacters  to 
the host intestinal epithelial cells. Rozynek et al. [36] 
and Wieczorek and Osek [37] have also identified this 
virulence gene to be present in the feces of poultry, 
animal,  and  human  isolates.  The  presence  of  flaA 
gene which determines flagellar motility responsible 
for motility and colonization of enterocytes is one of 
the best-studied virulence markers and in this study 
was present in 37 (97.37%) isolates. Previous studies 
have also indicated that the detection rate of flaA gene 
is high (>95%).

The  virB11  and  the  pldA  (phospholipase  A) 
genes are responsible for invasion and survival within 
the  host  cells.  The  virB11  gene  was  rarest  among 
all the studied genes and was present in the isolates 
obtained  from  poultry  droppings  (16.67%),  poultry 
ceca  (16.67%),  cattle  feces  (33.33%),  and  human 
stools (33.33%). Bang et al. [38] also found only 7.5% 
of the isolates from pigs and cattle to be positive for 
virB11.  Studies  conducted  on  poultry,  animals,  and 
humans  by  Biswas  et  al.  [15],  Talukder  et  al.  [39], 
Koolman et al. [40], and Jribi et al. [41] also, in fact, 
did not find the presence of virB11 gene. The pldA 
gene  was  also  detected  in  36.84%  isolates.  Melo 
et al. [42] also detected the presence of pldA gene in 
63.65% of the C. jejuni strains isolated from chicken 
meat. The presence of these genes poses a potential 
hazard to human health.

Antibiotic  susceptibility  profile  of  all  the  38 
isolates  (29  C.  coli  and  9  C.  jejuni)  revealed  100% 
resistance to NA. Only 2 (5.3%) C. coli and 1 (2.6%) 
C.  jejuni  were  resistant  to  AMP  and  GEN,  respec-
tively. Of all the isolates, 13.16%, 18.42%, 23.68%, 
36.84%, and 23.68% were intermediately sensitive to 
AMP,  GEN,  LE,  CIP,  and  CTR,  respectively,  prob-
ably  reflecting  a  shift  toward  resistance.  The  vari-
ation  in  the  antimicrobial  sensitivity  pattern  of  the 
Campylobacter  isolates  was  noticed  among  various 
reports.  A  significant  increase  in  the  resistance  for 
NA (46.7% of the isolates) and CIP (52.2%) was also 
observed in Spain [43]. However, in our study, all the 
isolates were found to be resistant to NA but sensi-
tive to CIP and LE. Furthermore, 100% resistance to 
cephalothin and COT and 100% sensitivity to AMP, 
GEN,  and  ERY  were  reported  [17].  Only  71.4%  of 
isolates had sensitivity against NA. 80% and 77% of 
Campylobacter  isolates  obtained  from Thailand  and 
Veterinary World, EISSN: 2231-0916 

India, respectively, were found to be resistant against 
fluoroquinolones [44]. Higher resistance rates to CIP 
(95.8-99%, 85.4%, and 91%) have been reported in 
China [45], the United Arab Emirates [46], and South 
Africa [47], respectively. The development of resis-
tance in the poultry and animals of the study area is a 
potential threat to human health. There is much fear 
that  this  resistance  may  spread  to  environment  [48] 
which may further lead to difficult to treat cases.
Conclusion

The  present  study  highlights  the  existence  of 
thermophilic Campylobacters in poultry, animals, and 
even in human samples. The recovery of positive iso-
lates  from  humans  emphasizes  human-animal  prox-
imity that must have led to the transmission. The pres-
ence of virulence genes in the isolates marks their role 
in the establishment of the disease and thus modulates 
the clinical presentation in the host. Increasing antibi-
otic resistance against quinolone reflects the misuse/
overuse of the antibiotics in the area.
