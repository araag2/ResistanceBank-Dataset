Running title: Characterization, diversity and susceptibility of Stx2f - STEC  

Significance  and  Impact  of  the  Study:  Carriage  of  stx2f  gene  tends  to  be  underreported  in  pigeon 

Escherichia coli isolates because most routine genetic and phenotypic tests cannot efficiently target this gene 

or  detect  the  toxin.  Nevertheless,  pigeons  frequently  carry  E.  coli  strains  that  are  stx2f-positive  and  this 

situation is not limited to any distinct geographical area. The current results suggest that genetic background 

of stx2f-encoding E. coli is distinct from most Shiga-toxin producing E. coli strains. However, the factors that 

contribute  to  host  preferences  and  pathogenicity  remain  unclear.  These  findings  have  public  health 

significance that should be addressed in future research.

This study aimed to evaluate prevalence, characteristics, genotypic diversity, and antibacterial susceptibility 

of Escherichia coli encoding Shiga toxin 2f in domestic pigeons in different provinces of Iran. A total of 117 

fecal samples were collected from pigeons, and were subjected to molecular detection of stx2f.  In total, 20%, 

25.8%,  21.4%  and  9%  of  pigeons  from  Tehran,  Ferdows,  Garmsar  and  Babol  cities  carried  stx2f+ isolates 

respectively. Of the 460 E. coli isolates examined, 43 were stx2f+ and most also carried eae (95.3%) and astA 

(97.7%) genes. Some of the stx2f+ isolates harboured cnf (9.3%), but all were negative for stx1, stx2 (other 

subtypes)  and  ehly.  Most  Strains  (90%)  were  assigned  to  B1  phylogroup  and  possessed  Intimin-β. 

Fingerprinting  of  the    stx2f+  isolates  using  either  enterobacterial  repetitive  intergenic  consensus  sequences 

(ERIC)  or  random  amplified  polymorphic  DNA  (RAPD)  –  polymerase  chain  reaction  revealed  7  distinct 

profiles by each method, with one prevailing (65% and 39.5%, respectively). By the combination of methods 

10  profiles  were  recognised.  Ten  isolates  from  different  profiles  were  shown  to  belong  to  O20,  O78,  and 

O115 serogroups, and eight were 100% identical in the stx2f gene sequence.  The strains were consistently 

resistant to amoxicillin and lincospectin, and commonly resistance to tetracycline (88.4%) and doxycycline

Shiga  toxin-producing  Escherichia  coli  (STEC)  is  responsible  for  a  number  of  infectious  diseases  in 

humans and animals ranging from mild diarrhea to life threatening haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). 

The pathogenic capacity of STEC strains resides in a number of virulence factors, with Shiga toxins (Stx) 

being  the  most  important.  Two  types  of  Shiga  toxins  have  been  described:  Stx1,  which  is  rather 

homologous,  and  Stx2  which  is  more  heterogeneous  in  nature  and  consists  of  seven  known  subtypes 

 

including  Stx2f  (Mainil  and  Daube  2005).  Since  the  first  isolation  of  Stx2f-producing  E.  coli  from  a 

diarrheic patient (Gannon et al. 1990) (the relevant toxin was initially designated as SltIIva), the organism 

has been isolated from pigeons and some cases of human infections (Schmidt et al. 2000, Morabito et al. 

2001,  Farooq  et  al.  2009,  Prager  et  al.  2009).  Most  STEC  strains  have  evolved  with  rich  repertoire  of 

virulence  determinants.  One  of  the  major  virulence  factors  is  intimin,  an  outer  membrane  protein  that 

mediates intimate attachment to intestinal epithelial cells. The C-terminal end of intimin protein (Int-280) 

is  highly  variable,  allowing  the  recognition  of  intimin  subtypes.  It  is  also  the  cell-binding  domain  of 

intimin , which can affect pathogen-host interactions (Mainil and Daube 2005).  

Although Stx2f-producing E. coli is not generally regarded as a highly pathogenic STEC, recent studies show 

increasing evidence links to human infections especially infantile diarrhea (Ethoh et al. 2009; Prager et al. 

2009).  Presence  of  strains  harbouring  stx2f  tend  to  be  underreported  in  both  humans  and  animals,  partly 

because most of the available molecular and serological diagnostic methods produce unreliable results in the 

detection of the stx2f gene or its product (Schmidt et al. 2000; Ethoh et al. 2009; Prager et al. 2009; Feng et 

al.  2011).  Infrequent  identification  of  strains  possessing  stx2f    has  been  resulted  in  limited  information  on 

virulence, epidemiology, and antibacterial susceptibility of these strains compared to other STECs.

  Results and Discussion  

Prevalence and molecular characterization 

 Among 460 isolates tested, 43 isolates from 22 (18.8%) pigeons included the stx2f gene and were regarded 

as STEC. In summary, 20%, 25.8%, 21.4% and 9% of sampled pigeons from Tehran, Ferdows, Garmsar and 

Babol carried stx2f+ isolates respectively (Table 1). In the multiplex-PCR assay, 41 isolates (95.3%) out of 

these 43 also harboured the eae gene, but none of the isolates contained stx1, stx2 and ehly. Screening for 

other virulence genes revealed the presence of astA in 97.7% (42/43), and cnf in 9.3% (4/43) of the isolates, 

but all were negative for saa.   Subtyping of eae gene in 11 isolates showed that 10 isolates contained Int-β, 

and one Int-α2.  

Domestic  pigeons  (Columba  livia  domestica)  are  widespread  in  different  cities,  inhabit  crowded  areas  like 

shrines, and are commonly raised by fanciers in Iran. Therefore, pigeons carrying STEC can be a potential 

reservoir  for  pathogenic  E.  coli  strains  in  urban  and  rural  areas.  The  presence  of  other  stx  subtypes  was 

previously reported in  E. coli isolates from pigeons in Iran (Ghanbarpour and Daneshdoost  2012), but the 

occurrence  of  stx2f  harbouring  E.  coli  has  not  been  reported.  The  present  study  aimed  to  investigate  the 

prevalence, characteristics, clonal diversity, and antibacterial susceptibility of stx2f+ E. coli strains isolated 

from domestic pigeons in four provinces in Iran. Unraveling the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of 

STEC  strains  originated from  diverse  geographical  areas  could  potentially  help  better  understanding  of the 

epidemiology  of  associated  disease  outbreaks,  and  the  mechanisms  underlying  the  evolution  of  emerging 

Although  pigeons  are  considered  as  natural  reservoirs  of  Stx2f-producing  E.  coli,  several  studies  have 

applied  inappropriate  methods  for  detection  of  STEC  strains in  pigeons.  For  example,  the  Premier  EHEC 

ELISA  kit  (Meridian  Bio-science)  and  the  PCR  protocol  of  Paton  and  Paton  (1998),  used  by  Wani  et  al. 

(2004), Pedersen et al. (2006), Silva et al. (2009) and Ghanbarpour and Daneshdoost (2012), both known to 

be incapable of detecting the stx2f subtype (Ziebell et al. 2002; Feng et al. 2011). This lack of sensitivity for 

detection of stx2f can explain, at least in part, the lower prevalence of STEC strains (2.9%  stx2 and 1.4%

stx1) in pigeons of southeast Iran in comparison to our findings (Ghanbarpour and Daneshdoost 2012). The 

overall prevalence of stx2f –harboring strains in pigeon populations was 18.8%, ranging from 9% to 25.8% 

in the four studied cities in the current study. Studying pigeons in Germany, Grossmann et al. (2005) have 

found a higher prevalence of stx2f in urban areas comparing to other stx subtypes. Similar to the findings of 

the  current  study,  Morabito  et  al.  (2001)  have  reported  a  prevalence  of  stx2f+  strains  of  8%,  12.1%,  and 

12.4% in pigeons in three squares in Rome. The higher prevalence of STEC in the current study may have 

resulted from a different screening approach for the identification of stx2f+ strains.  In contrast, a very low 

prevalence of stx2f+ E. coli has been reported in pigeon populations of Finland and Japan (Kobayashi et al. 

2002; Kobayashi et al. 2009). 

 The results of the current study and previous investigations indicate some unique characteristics of Stx2f-

producing  Escherichia  coli  strains.  First,  these  strains  only  harbour  one  type  of  Shiga  toxin  gene;  this 

 

particular feature is relatively uncommon among other STEC strains (Mainil and Daube 2005; Prager et al.

2009). Another important characteristic is the marked consistency with regard to the possession of virulence 

genes  and  eae  subtypes,  as  almost  all  isolates  in  the  current  study  possessed  the  eae  and  astA  genes. 

Similarly,  the  widespread  occurrence  of  eae  (mostly  the  Int-β  subtype),  astA,  and  cdt  gene  were  reported 

previously  in  stx2f+  strains  (Morabito  et  al.  2001;  Ethoh  et  al.  2009;  Prager  et  al.  2009).  This  picture 

differed in the case  of  cnf gene  in the current  study, and  only  9.3% of strains were  positive for this trait. 

Interestingly,  this  degree  of  consistency  in  the  genetic  background  is  in  contrast  to  considerable  serotype 

diversity observed in many investigations (Morabito et al. 2000; Schmidt et al. 2000; Kobayashi et al. 2009; 

Prager et al. 2009). The high prevalence of astA gene that encodes EAST1 (Enteroaggregative heat stable 

enterotoxin  1)  should  be  particularly  taken  into  consideration  as  the  emerging  highly  pathogenic 

enteroaggregative haemorrhagic pathotype (EAHEC) harbour this virulence determinant (Brzuszkiewicz et 

al. 2011).  

While  there  is  insufficient  information  to  consider  stx2f-harbouring  STEC  as  a  normal  inhabitant  of  the 

gastrointestinal tract of pigeons, the widespread occurrence of these organisms in Columbiformes (pigeons 

and  doves)  is  a  known  fact.    Morabito  et  al.  (2001) recaptured  20  pigeons  that  initially  were  positive  for

stx2f-STEC, but found that 15 were negative in secondary tests. Interestingly, the less developed cecum in 

pigeons  does  favour  transient  bacterial  fauna  (Baele  et  al.  2002;  Silva  et  al.  2009).  On  the  other  hand, 

pigeons  may  acquire  other  STECs  through  diverse  environmental  sources.  The  experimental  infection  of 

pigeons by O157:H7 E. coli resulted in a carrier state for up to 29 days without any clinical signs (Cizek et 

al.  2000).  These  facts  suggest  pigeons  gut  to  act  as  a  possible  niche  for  horizontal  gene  transfer  and 

evolution of emerging pathogenic clones theoretically. 

It  is  not  clear  at  the  moment  that  what  selective  forces  mediate  the  maintenance  of  particular  virulence 

determinants  in  the  genome  of  strains  carrying  stx2f  and  preferential  colonization  in  Columbiformes. 

Comparative genomic analysis is required to expand our knowledge about evolutionary perspective of these 

host adapted STEC strains with ability to infect humans. 

Molecular fingerprinting and phylogenetic groups 

 

Molecular fingerprinting by ERIC-PCR revealed 7 profiles (designated as A to G) in the 43 stx2f+ isolates

(Figure 1). Profile A prevailed and was present in 65.1% (28/43) of isolates, and profile B was present in 

23.25% of isolates. Only one isolate belonged to each of the remaining profiles (C-G), each with a frequency 

of 2.3%. In RAPD-PCR, 7 profiles were observed and designated as A to G (Figure 2). Profile A was present 

in 46.5% (20/43) of isolates; profile B was observed in 13.95%; E in 23.25%, and G in 9.3% of the isolates. 

Other profiles (C, D, F) each were observed with a frequency of 2.3% (Table 2). Combination of ERIC and 

RAPD-PCR discriminated 10 distinct profiles, which designated as A′ to J′ as follows: A′ (A+A), B′ (B+B), 

C′ (C+C), D′ (D+D), E′ (E+E), F′ (F+F), G′ (B+E), H′ (A+G), I′ (G+E), and J′ (A+E). The most prevalent 

profile was A′ with the frequency of 46.5% (20/43). The observed frequencies of A′ to J′ composite-profiles 

in different geographical areas are presented in Table 2.  

Fingerprinting by the combination ERIC and RAPD-PCR increased the discriminatory power of methods in 

some  instances.  In  RAPD-PCR,  the  discrimination  of  genotypes  was  similar  to  ERIC  in  two  areas,  but 

distribution of RAPD-types differed from ERIC in Tehran and Babol cities. As Table 2 shows, most of the 

genetic diversity was observed in isolates from Tehran and Garmsar prefectures. Clonal relatedness of stx2f+ 

E.  coli  isolated  from  pigeons  was  reported  previously.  In  Italy  pulse  field  gel  electrophoresis  (PFGE)

analysis showed that most of the strains from a flock exhibited similar profile; other isolates were related, but 

most of them revealed different patterns (Morabito et al. 2001).  

In  phylogenetic  grouping,  40  strains  (90%)  only  possessed  the  TSPE4.C2  gene  and  were  assigned  to  B1 

phylogroup; the remaining 3 isolates harbored three genes and belonged to B2 phylogroup (Clermont et al., 

2000). To our knowledge there is not any available information regarding phylogroups of stx2f+ strains at 

the moment, but the results of this study shows a high degree of similarity in phylogenetic groups of stx2f+ 

strains isolated from diverse geographical areas. 

Serotyping 

Serotyping  of  10  selected  representative  strains  showed  that  five  strains  belonged  to  O20  serogroup,  four 

strains belonged to O78, and only one strain was positive for O115 somatic antigen. Seven strains out of ten 

 

were non-motile. A wide range of serogroups has also been previously reported in Stx2f-producing STECs 

worldwide  including  O15,  O18,  O20,  O25,  O45,  O63,  O75,  O128,  O132,  O145,  O152,  O147,  and  O178 

(Morabito et al. 2000; Schmidt et al. 2000; Kobayashi et al. 2009; Prager et al. 2009).

Sequencing of stx2f gene 

Eight  out  of  the  ten  examined  strains  produced  the  specific  625bp  amplicon  and  were  successfully 

sequenced. Two strains generated very faint specific bands that proved unsuitable for efficient sequencing. 

Interestingly, both of these strains showed the unique composite ERIC- RAPD profiles (C′ and D′). Multiple 

alignments  by  ClustalX  of  500bp  fragments  from  the  eight  sequences  showed  100%  identity.  One  of  the 

obtained  sequences  was  blasted  in  the  nucleotide  database  deposited  in  the  NCBI  Gene  Bank  and  100% 

similarity was observed against most type strains of Stx2f-producing STEC including H.I.8 and O128: NM 

(accession numbers: AJ271139.1, AB499813.1). The sequence identity was estimated to be 99% against a 

few  Stx2f-producing  STEC  (e.g.  O115:NM:  AB472687.1).  The  obtained  sequence  from  T5B-Ir  isolate 

(O115:  NM)  in  this  study  was  deposited  in  Gene  Bank  (KJ397538).  According  to  the  new  standardized

nomenclature system for Shiga toxins (Scheutz et al. 2012), the current study did not show any variant for 

stx2f subtype in isolates from  Iran. The predicted amino acid sequences of T5b-Ir strain in this study also 

aligned with some Stx2 subtypes in the reference protein database (Swiss-prot) using ClustalW as depicted 

in Figure S1.  

 Antibacterial susceptibility  

All  stx2f+  isolates  were  resistant  to  amoxicillin  and  lincospectin;  while  resistance  to  tetracycline, 

doxycycline  and  neomycin  was  observed  in  88.4,  74.4  and  13.9%  of  the  isolates,  respectively.  The  most 

effective  antibacterials  were  furazolidone,  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  and  gentamicin  with  the 

susceptibility  rates  of  95.3,  83.7,  and  76.7%  respectively.  Noticeably,  intermediate  susceptibility  to 

florfenicol,  neomycin,  and  enrofloxacin  was  observed  in  majority  of  the  isolates  (Table  3).  All  strains 

 

showed multiple resistance, and most (81.4%) were resistant to four or more antibacterial agents.   

There appears to be no previous report on the antibacterial susceptibility of stx2f possessing isolates. In the 

current  study,  resistance  to  some  antibacterials  was  alarming  as  all  isolates  were  consistently  resistant  to 

amoxicillin and lincospectin, and showed considerable resistance to tetracycline and doxycycline. Noticeable 

intermediate  sensitivity  to  some  potent  antibacterials  like  neomycin,  enrofloxacin,  florfenicol,  and 

ceftriaxone limits the choices of antimicrobial therapy as it has been suggested that strains with intermediate 

susceptibility  to  antibiotics  should  be  considered  resistant  in  clinical  settings  (Beco  et  al.  2013). 

Uncontrolled use of antibacterials by pigeon fancier can be considered an important factor contributing to 

high  resistance  against  antibiotics.  The  spread  of  resistance  genes  via  plasmids  or  other  mobile  genetic 

elements to other enteric bacteria means that domestic pigeons could be an important biological source for 

resistance.

  Materials and Methods 

Sampling, E. coli isolation and molecular characterization 

A  total  number  of  117  domestic  pigeons  were  sampled  from  Tehran  (n=25),  Ferdows  (n=31),  Garmsar 

(n=28) and Babol (n=33) cities, which are located in Tehran, Khorasan, Semnan and Mazandaran provinces, 

respectively. The samples were collected from cloaca or fresh dropping of pigeons using sterile swabs and 

sent  to  the  laboratory  in  Amies  transport  medium  (BBL,  USA)  within  24h  of  collection.  Samples  were 

streaked on MacConkey agar, and up to four suspect pink colonies from each sample sub-cultured on LB 

agar. Crude bacterial DNA was extracted by the boiling method; then, strains were subjected to PCR using 

the specific primers for stx2f gene (Schmidt et al. 2000). Multiplex-PCR targeting stx1, stx2, eae and ehly 

was  performed  on  all  strains  that  possessed  the  stx2f  gene  (Paton  and  Paton  2002).  The  presence  of 

additional  virulence  genes  including  saa  (STEC  autoagglutinating  adhesin),  astA  (Enteroaggregative  heat 

 

stable  enterotoxin)  and  cnf  (Cytotoxic  necrotizing  factor)  was  further  investigated  by  PCR  as  described 

previously (Yamamoto et al. 1997; Paton and Paton 2002; Ewers et al. 2004). All stx2f-positive isolates were 

confirmed to be  Escherichia coli using conventional biochemical tests and stored at -70°C in glycerol for 

further analysis.  

Eleven strains containing stx2f and eae genes were randomly selected from different cities and subjected to a 

typing PCR for eae gene using one forward (EaeVF), and three reverse primers (Eae VR, Eae IotaVR, Eae 

ZetaVR).  The  834  to  876bp  specific  products  of  the  eae  gene  were  subsequently  subjected  to  restriction 

fragment  length  polymorphism  (RFLP)  and  digested  by  AluI  ,  RsaI  and  CfoI  (Fermentas,  Lithuania) 

separately to determine the intimin subtypes according to Ramachandran et al. (2003).

Molecular fingerprinting 

All  isolates,  which  were  positive  for  stx2f  gene,  were  subjected  to  enterobacterial  repetitive  intergenic 

consensus  sequences  PCR  (ERIC-PCR)  and  random  amplified  polymorphic  DNA  PCR  (RAPD-PCR) 

fingerprinting methods. First, DNA was extracted from 18h LB broth culture; and concentration of DNA was

primers 

ERIC1 

(5′-ATGTAAGCTCCTGGGGATTCAC-3′) 

and 

ERIC2 

(5′-

AAGTAAGTGACTGGGGTGAGCG-3′) as described by Versalovic et al. (1991). The PCR was conducted 

in  a 25  µl  volume  containing  50  ng  template  DNA, 2  mmol  l-1  MgCl2,  0.4  µmol  l-1  primers,  1.25  U  Taq 

DNA polymerase (Fermentas, Lithuania) and 200 µmol l-1  dNTP mix in 1xPCR buffer. The applied thermal 

cycles were as follow: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 7 min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, 

annealing at 50 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 3 min; followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 15 

min. Electrophoresis was performed using 2% agarose gel at 70v for three hours. 

In  RAPD-PCR,  primer  1247  (5′-AAGAGCCCGT-3′)  was  used  (Heuvelink  et  al.  1995).  The  PCR  was 

carried out in a 25 µl volume containing 50 ng template DNA, 2.5 mmol l-1 MgCl2, 0.4 µmol l-1 primer, 1.5 

U Taq DNA polymerase (Fermentas, Lithuania) and 200 mmol l-1  dNTP mix in 1xPCR buffer. The PCR 

 

program  was  conducted  as  previously  described  by  Schmidt  et  al.  (1999),  with  the  exception  that 

electrophoresis  applied  for  4h  at  70v.  Both  ERIC  and  RAPD-PCR  were  repeated  twice  to  ensure

reproducibility of results.  

Phylogenetic analysis 

The 43 stx2f+ E. coli isolates were subjected to phylogenetic group analysis according to Clermont et al. 

(2000).  Strains  were  assigned  to  one  of  the  four  phylogenetic  groups  (A,  B1,  B2,  D)  based  on  the 

possession or absence of three genes (chuA, TSPE4.C2, yjaA). Multiplex-PCR conducted in 25 µl using 

50  ng  template  DNA,  1.5  mM  MgCl2,  0.5  µM  of  each  primers,  1U  Taq  DNA  polymerase  (Cinnagen, 

Iran) and 200 µM dNTP mix in 1xPCR buffer. The applied thermal cycles were consisted of 94°C for 

35s, 59°C for 15s, and 72°C for 20s. The annealing temperature in the initial 5 cycles was 61°C for 30s, 

decreasing to 60 in the next 5 cycles, and 59°C in the remaining 23 cycles.

  Serotyping 

A total number of ten representative strains showing different composite-profiles were chosen with respect to 

different geographical areas and subjected to serogrouping of O-antigens using commercial antisera (Mast 

diagnostics,  UK)  according  to  the  manufacturer’s  instruction.  Motility  of  these  strains  was  also  tested  by 

inoculation into motility test medium to demonstrate the presence of flagellar antigens. 

Sequencing of stx2f gene 

Ten  strains  with  different  composite-profiles  (the  same  strains  as  described  above)  were  subjected  to 

amplification  of  the  stx2f  gene  using  f4-f  and  R-e/f  primers  as  described  for  sequencing  of  stx2f  gene 

previously (Scheutz et al. 2012). The quality of PCR products was verified by electerophoresis in agarose 

gels,  and  the  suitable  products  with  sharp  specific  bands  were  sequenced  using  ABI  3731xl  (Applied 

Biosystems) automated sequencer.

Antibacterial Susceptibility of the stx2f+ strains was determined on Mueller-Hinton agar (Merk, Germany) 

by  Kirby-Bauer  method  according  to  CLSI  protocol  (CLSI  2008).  Twelve  antibacterial  discs  were  used 

including  amoxicillin,  gentamicin,  neomycin,  enrofloxacin, 

lincospectin,  doxycycline, 

tetracycline, 

furazolidon, trimethoprim, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, florfenicol and ceftriaxone.
