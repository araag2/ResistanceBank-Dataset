Abstract Escherichia coli O157 is an important food-borne
pathogen that can cause diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis, and
haemolytic uraemic syndrome. The aim of this study was to
investigate the prevalence, virulence genes, antibiotic resis-
tance, and genetic diversity of E. coli O157 and O157:H7 in
retail fresh raw meat sold in the markets of South China. Of
551 samples collected, 21 (3.81 %) were contaminated with
E. coli O157 and seven (1.27 %) with O157:H7. The highest
prevalence rate was found in beef (13.32 %), followed by pork
(6.90 %), chicken (3.28 %), duck (2.54 %), and mutton (0).
The virulence genes stx1, stx2, eaeA, and hlyA were detected
in 10.71, 21.43, 85.71, and 25 % of 28 isolates, respectively.
The isolates were highly resistant to penicillin (100 %), chlor-
amphenicol (64.29 %), ampicillin (57.14 %), and sensitive to
gentamicin (100 %), cefotazidime (96.43 %), and ciprofloxa-
cin (96.43 %). Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-
PCR (ERIC-PCR) classified 28 isolates and two reference
strains into 19 different profiles with a discrimination index
(D) of 0.961. Four E. coli O157:H7 isolates from beef showed
83 % similarity with the two clinical reference strains, indicat-
ing a potential high virulence for consumers. The results of
this study suggested that fresh raw meat could be potential
vehicles for transmission of E. coli O157 to humans.

Introduction

Escherichia coli O157 is an important food-borne pathogen
that can cause diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis (HC), and
haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) in humans (Bettelheim
and Beutin 2003; Caro et al. 2006). E. coli O157:H7 is the
predominant serotype causing severe human infections. Cattle
and meat products are considered to be the main reservoir of
E. coli O157 worldwide (Gyles 2007). However, the organism
has also been isolated from other animal meat products such
as chicken, pork, and lamb (Doane et al. 2007; Lenahan et al.
2007; Ateba and Mbewe 2011). Consumption of raw or
undercooked contaminated meat is one of the most common
means of transmitting this organism to humans, and meat and
meat products have been implicated in outbreaks of E. coli
O157:H7 in different parts of the world (Bell et al. 1994;
Abong’o and Momba 2009).

The pathogenicity of E. coli O157 and E. coli O157:H7 is
associated with several virulence factors. Shiga toxins 1 and 2
(encoded by stx1 and stx2 genes) are the most important vir-
ulence factors, and play a major role in the pathogenesis of HC
and HUS (Abu-Ali et al. 2009; Seker et al. 2010). Besides
shiga toxins, intimin (encoded by bacterial eaeA gene) and
enterohaemolysin (encoded by E-hlyA genes) are also two
important virulence factors. Intimin was found to be respon-
sible for attachment of the bacteria to the intestinal epithelial
cells, causing attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions in the in-
t e s t i n a l m u c o s a ( D e a n - N y s t r o m e t a l . 1 9 9 7 ) .
Enterohaemolysin has been demonstrated to cause enterocyte
and leukocyte lysis in cattle (Bauer and Welch 1996). The

high virulence combined with the low infection dose make
infections in humans particularly severe.

Studies revealed an increasing antibiotic resistance of
E. coli O157 and O157:H7 in animals and meat (Magwira
et al. 2005; Govaris et al. 2011). The presence of antibiotic-
resistant strains in meat may represent a threat to human health
because such strains can be transmitted to reach humans
through the consumption of contaminated meat. Therefore,
surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in E.coli O157 is very
important for preventing the spread of antimicrobial resistance
in organisms and future disease management.

Molecular typing is a useful tool for determining the genet-
ic relationship of food-borne bacteria and identifying probable
sources of infections. Among the various typing methods,
pulsed field gel electrophoresis is considered to be the gold
standard for fingerprinting E. coli O157 strains due to its high
discriminatory ability (Swaminathan et al. 2001). However,
this assay is labour-intensive and time-consuming. In contrast,
enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase
chain reaction (ERIC-PCR) is a relatively simple and cost-
effective method, which has been successfully used for
genotyping of different bacterial pathogens and for tracking
the bacterial source of contaminated food products (Ye et al.
2009; Chen et al. 2014).

In China, the prevalence, virulence genes, and antimicrobial
resistance of E. coli O157 in retail fresh raw meat sold in the
markets in South China has not been thoroughly investigated.
Furthermore, the genetic diversity of E. coli O157 isolates from
meat samples is unknown. The aim of this study was to inves-
tigate the presence of E. coli O157 and O157:H7 strains in
retail fresh raw meat sold in South Chinese markets, examine
the presence of stx1, stx2, eaeA, and hlyA genes, evaluate the
antimicrobial resistance of the isolates, and further analyze the
genetic diversity of the isolates by ERIC-PCR.

Material and methods

Sample collection

From February 2013 to January 2014, a total of 551 fresh
raw meat samples, including 68 beef, 183 chicken, 118
duck, 37 mutton, and 145 pork samples, were purchased
randomly from open markets and supermarkets located in
four provinces (14 cities) of South China. The geographic
locations of the samples sites are shown in Figure S2. Sam-
ples consisted of cut meat aseptically removed from animal
carcasses (legs, neck, shoulder, breast) and minced meat.
From each city, 35 to 45 samples (about 500 g per sample)
were randomly collected, placed in separate sterile plastic
bags to prevent spilling and cross contamination and then
immediately transported to the laboratory in a cooler with
ice packs and processed within 4 h.

Isolation and biochemical identification of E. coli O157

Escherichia coli O157 was isolated from meat samples
using the USDA method with slight modifications (USDA
2002). Briefly, 25 g of each sample was placed into 225 ml
of modified EC broth supplemented with 20 mg/l novobi-
ocin (Merck, SA), homogenized for 2 min at 260 rpm
using a Stomacher (Model 400 circulator, Seward Medical,
Ltd., UK), and incubated for 18–24 h at 41.5 °C. The
enrichment cultures were subjected to immunomagnetic
separation (IMS) using beads coated with antibodies against
E. coli O157 (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions. After IMS, a 50 μl suspension ob-
tained from IMS was streaked onto CHROMagar O157
(CHROMagar Microbiology, France). Plates were incubated
at 36 °C±1 °C for 18–24 h. Up to eight presumptively
positive colonies were selected, and sub-cultured onto nu-
trient agar plates (Huankai, Ltd, Guangzhou, China). The
isolates were identified using API 20E test strips
(bioMérieux, Marcy I’Etoile, France) and by performing
conventional biochemical tests, including triple sugar iron
agar, sorbitol fermentation, and indole tests. All presump-
tive colonies were further tested using E. coli O157 latex
agglutination (Tianrun Ltd., Ningbo, China).

Identification of E. coli O157 and O157:H7 by multiplex PCR

The agglutinating colonies were confirmed by multiplex
PCR as described previously (Xu and others 2008).
Bacterial DNA was extracted from isolates using a com-
mercial DNA extraction kit
(Dongsheng Biotech,
Guangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions. The primers and PCR conditions are shown
in Table 1.

PCR amplification was performed in a 25 μl reaction
mixture consisting of 2.5 μl of 10× PCR buffer (500 mM
KCl, 200 mM Tris–HCl), 14.9 μl of sterile distilled water,
2.5 μl of 0.2 mM dNTPs, 3.0 μl of 25 mM MgCl2, 0.5 μl
of 10 mM of each primer, 0.1 μl of 10 U of Taq DNA
polymerase (Promega, WI, USA), and 1 μl of DNA tem-
plate. The thermal cycling started with an initial incubation
at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation
at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 59 °C for 1 min, extension
at 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for
10 min. E. coli O157:H7 ATCC 35150 was included as
positive controls, and distilled water was used as a negative
control. Amplification was performed with a DNA Thermal
Cycler (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). The amplified
products were then analysed by electrophoresis in a
1.2 % agarose gel containing Gold View (SBS Genetech,
Beijing, China);
the bands were visualized using
ImageQuant 350 Capture (GE Healthcare, WI, USA).

Determination of virulence genes by PCR assay

All the isolates were screened for the presence of stx1, stx2,
eaeA, and hlyA genes using PCR methods previously de-
scribed (Paton and Paton 1998; Sarimehmetoglu et al. 2009;
Bai et al. 2010). The primers and PCR reaction conditions are
listed in Table 1.

Bacterial DNA extraction for isolated strains was conduct-
ed as described above. E. coli O157:H7 ATCC 35150 (eaeA+,
hlyA+, stx1+, stx2+) was included as a positive control, and
distilled water was used as a negative control. The PCR prod-
ucts were separated by electrophoresis with 1.2 % agarose gel
at 120 V for 20 min in Tris-acetate buffer. The bands were
visualized using ImageQuant 350 Capture (GE Healthcare,
WI, USA).

Antimicrobial resistance test

The antibiotic resistance of E. coli O157 and O157:H7 isolates
was determined using the disk diffusion method according to
the recommendations of the Clinical and Laboratory Stan-
dards Institute (CLSI 2006). Muller-Hinton agar and 13 anti-
microbial agents were used for the assay. The 13 antibiotics
(Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) tested were as follows: amikacin
(30 μg), ampicillin (10 μg), cefotaxime (30 μg), ceftazidime
(10 μg), cephalothin (30 μg), chloramphenicol (30 μg), cip-
rofloxacin (5 μg), gentamicin (10 μg), kanamycin (30 μg),
norfloxacin (10 μg), penicillin (10 U), streptomycin (10 μg),
and tetracycline (30 μg). The isolates were classified as sen-
sitive, intermediate, and resistant using the breakpoints spec-
ified by the NCCLS, and E. coli ATCC 25922 was used as the
reference strain.

Genetic typing of E. coli O157 and O157:H7 by ERIC-PCR

For ERIC-PCR, the primers ERIC-1 (5′-ATGTAAGCTCCT
GGGGATTCAC-3′) and ERIC2 (5′-AAGTAAGTGACTGG

GGTGAGCG-3′) were used (Versalovic et al. 1991). The
PCR was performed in a 25 μl solution containing 1.0 U of
Taq DNA polymerase (Dongsheng), 1.0 μM of each primer,
2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM each dNTP, and 40 ng of template
genomic DNA. Amplifications were performed with a DNA
Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) with the
following temperature profile: an initial denaturation at
94 °C for 3 min; 35 cycles each consisting of 1 min at
94 °C, 1 min at 52 °C, 3 min at 72 °C; and a final extension
at 72 °C for 10 min. The ERIC-PCR products were separated
by performing electrophoresis by using a 2.0 % agarose gel
with GoldView stain (0.005 %, v/v), and the gel was
photographed using an UV Imaging System (GE Healthcare,
WI, USA). The images were captured in TIFF file format for
further analysis. Cluster analysis was performed with NTSYS-
pc (Version 2.10). The index of discriminatory (DI) ability
was calculated as described by Hunter and Gaston (1988).

Results and discussion

Prevalence of E. coli O157 and O157:H7 in meat samples

Of 551 meat samples collected, 21 (3.81 %) were contami-
nated with E. coli O157 and seven (1.27 %) with O157:H7
(Total 5.08 %, Table 2). E. coli O157 was isolated from four
beef, six chicken, three duck, and eight pork samples; where-
as, E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from five beef and two pork
samples. The highest prevalence of E. coli O157 and
O157:H7 was found in beef (13.32 %), followed by pork
(6.90 %), chicken (3.28 %), duck (2.54 %), and mutton
(0 %). Previous studies conducted in various parts of the
world showed that the prevalence of E. coli O157 or E. coli
O157:H7 was 2.1–28 % in beef (Jo et al. 2004; Stampi et al.
2004; Doane et al. 2007; Olatoye 2010; Rahimi et al. 2012),
1.7–4.8 % in sheep or goat meat (Hiko et al. 2008; Rahimi
et al. 2012), 0–0.9 % in chicken (Jo et al. 2004; Doane et al.

Mbewe 2011). The variation in contamination rates of meat
samples from different countries could be due to the differ-
ences in sample types, study sample numbers, seasonal ef-
fects, and detection methods used.

In our investigation, E. coli O157 and E. coli O157:H7
were not detected in the mutton samples. This may be
partly related to the small number of mutton samples
analysed in this study. Additionally, E. coli O157 was iso-
lated from 2.54 % of duck, suggesting that duck may be an
important source of E. coli O157 strains. To our

Ann Microbiol

knowledge, no study on the prevalence of E. coli O157
in duck from China or other countries has yet been report-
ed .

Virulence gene profiles of E. coli O157 and O157:H7

A total of 28 isolates (21 E. coli O157 and seven E. coli
O157:H7) were identified by multiplex PCR (Figure S1).
The distribution of the virulence genes in E. coli O157 and
O157:H7 is shown in Fig. 1. The isolates had eight distinct
genotype combinations and 24 (85.71 %) of the isolates car-
ried at least one virulence gene. The stx2 gene was detected in
21.43 % of isolates (one E. coli O157 and five E. coli
O157:H7), while the stx1 gene was detected in 10.71 % of
isolates (one E. coli O157 and two E. coli O157:H7). Both
stx1 and stx2 were detected in one E. coli O157:H7. The stx2
was the predominant shiga toxin genotype. These results are
in accordance with those of previous studies carried out in
China and other countries (Villani et al. 2005; Bai et al.
2010). Epidemiological studies have indicated that strains car-
rying stx2 are potentially more virulent than those carrying
stx1 or even strains carrying both stx1 and stx2 and that stx2-
producing strains are more frequently related to HUS than
those producing stx1 or those producing both stx1 and stx2
(Sallam et al. 2013). Thus, it is possible to speculate that most

of the E. coli O157:H7 isolates recovered in this study are
highly virulent for humans.

The eaeA gene encodes a 94- to 97-kDa outer membrane
protein (intimin). Researchers have emphasized the strong
association between the presence of the eaeA gene and the
pathogenesis of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli strains in human
disease (Beutin et al. 2004). It has been reported that intimin
alone can lead to diarrhea in humans by an attaching and effac-
ing ability (Blanco et al. 2004). In our study, the eaeA gene was
detected in 85.71 % of isolates (17 E. coli O157 and seven E. coli
O157:H7). This finding is comparable to that reported in other
studies. Cagney et al. (2004) reported that all the 43 (100 %)
E. coli O57:H7 stains isolated from ground beef and beef
burger carried eae and hlyA genes, whereas Cadirci et al.
(2010) found that 75 % (6/ 8) of E. coli O57 isolates from beef
and raw meatball carried eaeA with other virulence genes.

The hlyA gene encodes a plasmid-encoded enterohemolysin.
The precise role of hlyA is unknown now, but is frequently
present in LEE-negative (does not encode the locus of
enterocyte effacement) Shiga toxigenic E. coli strains from dif-
ferent sources, including clinical samples from HUS patients
(Pradel et al. 2008). In our study, 25 % of isolates (five E. coli
O157:H7 and two E. coli O157) carried the hlyA gene. These
results are different from previous studies (Cagney et al. 2004;
Cadirci et al. 2010), in which all the E. coli O157:H7 isolates
from food animals and beef possessed the hlyA gene. Our re-
sults indicated that the hlyA gene was present in most, but not
all, of the E. coli O157:H7 strains isolated.

Antimicrobial resistance of E. coli O157 and O157:H7

Thirteen antimicrobials commonly used in human and veter-
inary infections were used to determine the antibiotic

resistance of E. coli O157 and O157:H7. The results showed
that all of the 28 (100 %) isolates were resistant to penicillin,
18 (64.29 %) to chloramphenicol, 16 (57.14 %) to ampicillin,
13 (46.43 %) to tetracycline, 11 (39.29 %) to kanamycin, and
seven (25.00 %) to streptomycin. All the 28 (100 %) isolates
were susceptible to gentamicin, 27 (96.43 %) to ceftazidime
and ciprofloxacin, 24 (85.71 %) to amikacin and norfloxacin,
22 (78.57 %) to cefotaxime, and 21 (75 %) to cephalothin.
Some isolates had intermediate resistance to amikacin, cefo-
taxime, cephalothin, and streptomycin (Fig. 1, Table 3).

Penicillin, ampicillin and tetracycline are commonly used
in veterinary medicine and livestock production for disease
prevention or as growth promoters in China. The high preva-
lence of antibiotic resistance of E. coli O157 isolates in this
study may be related to the wide spread use of these antibiotics
in animal husbandry. In previous studies, the high prevalence
of tetracycline and ampicillin resistance has also been docu-
mented (Olatoye 2010; Lukásová et al. 2004). Chloramphen-
icol is a banned antibiotic in food animals in many countries
including China. E. coli O157:H7 was reported to be 100 %
sensitive or have intermediate resistant to this antibiotic (Hiko
et al. 2008; Abong’o and Momba 2009). However, our results
showed that one (14.29 %) E. coli O157:H7 and 17(80.95 %)
E. coli O157 isolates were resistant to this antibiotic. The high
resistance to this antibiotic indicated that irregular and unau-
thorized use of it might have occurred in China. Gentamicin,
norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin are commonly used as thera-
peutics in human medicine. Most of the isolates in this study
were sensitive to these antibiotics. These results are consistent
with previous studies (Hiko et al. 2008; Goncuoglu et al.
2010). However, Abong’o and Momba (2009) found 75 %
(4/5) of E. coli O157:H7 isolates from meat were resistant to
gentamicin. These findings highlight the need for continuous

surveillance of emerging antimicrobial resistance in E. coli
O157 and O157:H7.

Additionally, our results indicated that 22 (78.57 %) iso-
lates were resistant to three or more antimicrobial agents. Par-
ticularly, one E. coli O157 isolate (016–3) was found to be
resistant to ten antibiotics. The multiple antimicrobial resis-
tance exhibited by E. coli O157 and O157:H7 is worrisome
and indicates potential antibiotic misuse. There is an urgent
need to regulate the use of antibiotics in food-producing ani-
mals and the environment in China.

antimicrobials) from chicken was clustered as a unique single-
ton E. One E. coli O157 isolate (240–3, resistant to four anti-
microbials) from duck also showed a distinctive pattern and
was grouped in singleton F. These unique DNA fingerprints
indicated that these isolates were genetically diverse from oth-
er isolates.

In this study, ERIC-PCR showed good discriminatory
power and indicated high genetic diversity in E. coli O157
and O157:H7 isolates from meat samples. These results are
similar to that of Ling et al. (2000). These findings suggested
that ERIC-PCR is a helpful tool for characterizing the genetic
relationships among isolates.

ERIC-PCR was used to study the genetic diversity of 28 iso-
lates and two reference strains. The results are shown in Fig. 1.
ERIC-PCR yielded three to nine bands ranging in size from
approximately 180 to 2909 bp, which classified 30 strains into
19 different patterns with a discrimination index (DI) of 0.961.
At a similarity level of 82 %, these strains were grouped into
two clusters and four singletons. Cluster A included 18 E. coli
O157 isolates and two E. coli O157:H7 isolates. Cluster B
comprised six E. coli O157:H7 (four isolates and two refer-
ence strains). Singletons C, D, E, and F included only one
isolate, respectively.

A correlation between the genomic profiles and the viru-
lence genes was observed in these strains. Most of the isolates
that carried eaeA or were without virulence genes were
grouped in cluster A. In this cluster, a good correlation among
ERIC patterns, virulence profiles, and the sample source was
found in some isolates. Two isolates (054–1 and 056–2) ob-
tained from pork in Conghua city showed 100 % similarity.
Two isolates (175–4 and 241–2) from chicken in Guangzhou
city showed 100 % similarity. Three isolates (E236-1, E142-2,
E230-3) from chicken in Conghua city also showed identical
ERIC patterns. These findings suggested that ERIC-PCR
could be reliable in studying the relationship of isolates from
different sources. Additionally, five isolates (E2253-3, E2372-
1, E073-3, E2453-1, E078-2) from different sources yielded
an identical pattern, suggesting that they were highly homog-
enous and had a close genetic relationship. In cluster B, all of
the four E. coli O157:H7 isolates (E202-2, E172-3, E049-2,
E050-2) were obtained from beef in Guangzhou city and car-
ried stx2. These isolates showed 83 % similarity with the two
clinical reference strains associated with HUS (ATCC 43894
and ATCC 35150), indicating that they may be highly virulent
for humans. In addition, one E. coli O157 isolate (E009-1) and
one E. coli O157:H7 isolate (E703-1) that carried stx1+
showed different patterns and were grouped in singleton C
and D, respectively.

No correlation was observed between the ERIC-PCR pro-
files and the antibiotic resistance profiles of the isolates. How-
ever, some distinguishable patterns were found in two isolates.

Conclusion

The results of this study revealed the presence of virulent,
antibiotic resistant E. coli O157 and O157:H7 in raw fresh
meats reaching consumers, indicating possible risks of infec-
tion to people through the consumption of raw/under-cooked
meat (especially beef). ERIC-PCR revealed high genetic di-
versity among the E. coli O157 and O157:H7 isolates in fresh
raw meat. Some E. coli O157:H7 isolates from beef showed
similar patterns with the clinical reference strains, indicating a
potential high virulence for consumers. This study for the first
time contributed data on the prevalence and characteristics of
E. coli O157 and O157:H7 in retail fresh raw meat in South
China, providing baseline information for regulatory authori-
ties to formulate a regulatory framework for controlling E. coli
O157 and O157:H7 to improve the microbiological safety of
meat.
