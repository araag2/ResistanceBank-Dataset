ABSTRACT: The emergence of antimicrobial resistance is arguably the most important threat to
human and animal health. The impacts of antimicrobial use can reach far from the site of
prescription and wildlife may serve as a conduit for the movement of resistance across landscapes,
contributing to the spread of antimicrobial resistance within and between different reservoirs. We
compared antimicrobial resistance and life history among wild and domestic species in Chobe,
Botswana to explore key attributes and behaviors that may increase exposure and allow resistance
to move between humans, animals, and ecosystems. Among 150 fecal samples evaluated from
African animals, 41.3% contained Escherichia coli isolates that were resistant to one or two of 10
tested antibiotics, and 13.3% of isolates demonstrated multidrug resistance (three or more
antibiotics). Resistance to each of the 10 tested antibiotics was detected among wildlife fecal
samples. Resistance was widespread, but not ubiquitous, and isolates from wildlife demonstrated
similar patterns of resistance to human E. coli from environmental and clinical sources in the study
area. Multidrug resistance was significantly higher in carnivores, water-associated species, and
species inhabiting urban areas, suggesting that life history may be key to understanding exposure
patterns and transmission dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes.

INTRODUCTION

Antimicrobial resistance is an emerging
problem of global proportions, resulting in
therapeutic failure and increased morbid-
ity and mortality among affected individu-
als. Our antimicrobial arsenal is dwindling
and resistance is on the rise, reflected in
the resurgence of historic diseases such as
extensively drug-resistant
tuberculosis,
Clostridium difficile diarrhea, and methi-
cillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In
the US, more than two million cases of
illness and at least 23,000 deaths occur
each year as a result of infection with
antimicrobial-resistant organisms (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention 2013).
In developing countries where the burden
of infectious disease is high, poor infection
control (low immunization rates, hospital
overcrowding), limited diagnostic capabil-
ities,
inconsistent prescribing behavior,
and the availability of antibiotics over
the counter likely all contribute to the

emergence of resistance (reviewed by
Laxminarayan and Heymann 2012).

Despite significant advances in our
understanding of the molecular dynamics
(Walsh 2000) and widespread occur-
rence of antimicrobial resistance across
a diversity of hosts (Rolland et al. 1985;
Goldberg et al. 2007; Rwego et al. 2008;
Blackburn et al. 2010; Wheeler et al. 2012;
Pesapane et al. 2013) and environments
(Pruden et al. 2006), it remains unclear
how the transmission of resistance occurs
across these complex landscapes and host
communities. This information is critical
to prevention. Wildlife provides a unique
opportunity to investigate landscape dy-
namics of antimicrobial resistance—each
species occupies a particular niche and
interacts with the environment in different
and specific ways, dependent on key life-
history strategy elements. In this respect,
wildlife communities may act as sentinels
for ecosystem health, providing clues to
points where human and natural systems

811

are coupled and transmission of antimi-
crobial resistance occurs.

In the Chobe District, northern Bots-
wana, humans
and wildlife live in
proximity, their spatial dynamics driven by
strong seasonal regimes that influence the
distribution of surface water resources
(Alexander et al. 2012). Primary health care
is available in the region; antibiotics can be
acquired freely over the counter and re-
sistance to many first-line antimicrobials is
common (Rowe et al. 2010; Pesapane et al.
2013; Renuart et al. 2013). There are no
commercial livestock or poultry production
operations in the region. We have already
demonstrated that significant antimicrobial
resistance exists in Escherichia coli isolated
from humans and banded mongoose (Mun-
gos mungo) in Chobe (Pesapane et al. 2013).
Here, we assess the extent of antimicrobial
resistance among fecal E. coli
isolates
collected from a diversity of animal species,
and explore the complex and potentially
interdependent drivers that may shape
microbial exchange across heterogeneous
landscapes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study site description

Botswana is a landlocked country in sub-
Saharan Africa with a subtropical climate and
highly variable rainfall. Our study site (Fig. 1)
is located within the Chobe District
in
northern Botswana, an area of 20,800 km2
that
includes the Chobe National Park (a
protected land area, managed to achieve long-
term conservation of natural resources) and
the adjacent villages of Kasane and Kazungula
(unprotected urban/periurban areas). The
Kwando–Chobe–Linyanti River system floods
in the dry season (April–October), arising from
rainfall in the Angolan highlands, and is the
sole source of water to the area for much of
the year. During the dry season, huge shifts in
biomass occur, prompted by a scarcity of
resources in the interior, concentrating hu-
mans and animals along the banks of
the
Chobe River.

Sample collection

Three technicians (an observer, a record
keeper, and a Basarwa tracker) collected fecal

samples between June and September 2011.
We have used the same tracker over the last
decade to reliably identify animal spoor and
fecal samples to the species of origin and
determine fecal age class (i.e., ,24 h, .24 h,
,1 wk, .1 wk). The observer and tracker
were the same individuals throughout
the
sampling. Fifty-five stratified transect points,
100 m long, were placed at 500-m intervals
along the Chobe River (Fig. 1), starting at
the confluence of the Chobe and Zambezi
rivers (transect 1: 17u47939.91140S, 25u159
38.55540E) and extending 27.5 km upstream,
into the Chobe National Park (transect 55:
17u49955.41540S, 25u2953.08740E). This sec-
tion of the river has been the focus of a long-
term water-quality project, work complemen-
tary to this study. Sampling commenced at
transect 1 and continued upstream to transect
55, and any feces (wildlife or domestic animal)
seen while traversing the transect line were
identified to species, sampled, and the GPS
location recorded. Using aseptic technique,
approximately 5 g was taken from the center
of
the fecal ball using a sterile tongue
depressor and collected in a sterile 50-mL
conical tube. Feces that could not be reliably
identified because of disruption and poor
surface type (failed spoor or footprint de-
tection), or were older than 24 h (as de-
termined by the tracker), were excluded from
the study. Fecal samples were transported
under cooled conditions and stored at 220 C
within 4 h of collection. A complete sampling
(transects 1–55) took approximately 5 d, and
sampling was repeated monthly for a total of
three sampling exercises.

One gram of feces from each sample was
homogenized by vortexing in 9 mL of
buffered peptone water (BPW; Becton,
Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes,
New Jersey, USA) and serially diluted to
1:102, 1:103, and 1:104 in BPW. We plated
100 mL of the 1:103 and 1:104 dilutions on
two MacConkey agar plates (Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc., Lenexa, Kansas, USA) and
incubated the plates at 37 C for 18 h. Plates
were inspected for adequate growth (50–80
well-spaced colonies), and six individual
colonies of pink to rose-red morphology
were picked per sample and placed sepa-
rately into tryptic soy broth (TSB; EMD
Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA),
following the methods of Goldberg et al.
(2006) and Pesapane et al.
(2013). We
incubated TSB cultures at 37 C for 18 h
and extracted DNA by heat/detergent lysis
and ethanol precipitation.

The DNA extracts were screened for E. coli
DNA by PCR, using genera-specific malB

primers ECO-1 and ECO-2 (Wang et al. 1996).
The PCR was conducted in a MyCyclerTM
thermocycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California,
USA) in reactions of 25 mL containing 1.5 mM
each primer, 13 Go Taq Master Mix (Promega,
Madison, Wisconsin, USA), 0.3 mL of 10%
dimethyl sulfoxide, and 1 mL of DNA (approx-
imately 100 ng). Cycling conditions were set at
95 C (15 min), followed by 30 cycles of 95 C (30
s), 55 C (45 s), and 72 C (45 s), with final
extension at 72 C (10 min). For quality
assurance, positive (E. coli strain ATCC 25922
DNA) and negative (water) control assays were
run with each round of PCR. Isolates confirmed
as E. coli were tested for sensitivity to 10
antimicrobials (10 mg of ampicillin, 30 mg of
chloramphenicol, 5 mg of ciprofloxacin, 30 mg
of doxycycline, 10 mg of gentamicin, 30 mg of
neomycin, 10 mg of streptomycin, 30 mg
of tetracycline, 25 mg of trimethoprim-sulfa-
methoxazole, and 30 mg of Ceftiofur; Thermo
Fisher Scientific) using the Kirby-Bauer disk
diffusion method (Bauer et al. 1966), following
the protocols and quality controls indicated by
the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
(CLSI 2009). To remain conservative in our
estimates of resistance, isolates exhibiting in-
termediate zones of inhibition were interpreted
as sensitive.

Results were compared with resistance data
for E. coli isolated from 193 human clinical
specimens (blood, urine, stool, and vaginal
swabs; one isolate per specimen) evaluated in
the laboratory of the Kasane Primary Hospital,
Kasane, Botswana, between July 2007 and July
2011. The laboratory serves the entire human
population living in the Chobe District, and
utilizes the same technique (Kirby-Bauer disk
diffusion) to evaluate antimicrobial sensitivity.
In contrast
feces,
human isolates demonstrating intermediate
zones of inhibition are classified as resistant
in this clinical setting, to reduce therapeutic
failure related to antibiotic resistance. Samples
originated in both healthy (employment health
certification) and clinically ill patients, pro-
viding useful insight into the prevalence and
nature of antibiotic resistance that may occur
in the local human population.

to isolates from animal

We also compared our findings with 77
E. coli isolates from 12 environmental sources
of human fecal waste (bush latrines, sewage
sludge, evaporation ponds, and wastewater
leakage) sampled in the study area between
June and September 2010 (Pesapane et al.
2013). These samples were processed as
described above; however, 15 E. coli colonies
were selected per sample (instead of six). The

814

number of human environmental samples was
low compared with human clinical and animal
fecal samples. However, this was a reflection
of fewer environmental sources of human fecal
waste and their difficulty in being located
before being destroyed, consumed by animals,
or older than 24 h and desiccated.

Data analysis

We categorized species on the basis of
interactions with the environment (diet, asso-
ciation with water, and land-use). Diet was
defined as primarily carnivorous (crocodile,
Crocodylus niloticus; spotted hyena, Crocuta
crocuta;
leopard, Panthera pardus; otter,
Aonyx capensis), herbivorous (Cape buffalo,
Syncerus caffer; bushbuck, Tragelaphus scrip-
tus; domestic cattle, Bos primigenius; ele-
phant, Loxodonta africana; giraffe, Giraffa
camelopardalis; hippopotamus, Hippopotamus
amphibious;
impala, Aepyceros melampus;
greater kudu, Tragelaphus strepsciseros; sable,
Hippotragus niger; waterbuck, Kobus ellipsi-
prymnus), or omnivorous (Chacma baboon,
Papio ursinus; guineafowl, Numida meleagris;
banded mongoose; vervet monkey, Chloroce-
bus pygerythrus; warthog, Phacochoerus afri-
canus). Water-associated species were defined
as those with an aquatic or semiaquatic life-
history strategy, or who graze primarily on
water-inundated floodplains (crocodile, hippo-
potamus, otter, and waterbuck). Land use was
defined as protected (Chobe National Park) or
unprotected (urban/periurban villages of
Kasane and Kazungula) on the basis of the
location where the fecal sample was collected.
Samples reflected the density of species in the
region, with some guilds (e.g., herbivores)
naturally occurring in higher numbers than
others (e.g., carnivores). To avoid potential
bias from uneven numbers of
isolates per
sample, statistical comparisons were only
conducted at the fecal sample level. A fecal
sample was defined as resistant if at least one
of
to
one or more antibiotics, and multidrug re-
sistant if at least one of its isolates was resistant
to three or more antibiotics. A fecal sample
containing two resistant isolates was still only
classified as resistant. Statistical analyses were
conducted using the binom and stats packages
in R version 3.0.0, www.R-project.org, and
Bonferroni-adjusted alpha values were applied
where necessary to correct
for multiple
comparisons.

This study was conducted under permit from
the Botswana Ministry of Environment, Wild-
life, and Tourism (EWT 8/36/4 XXVI [24]),
and the Institutional Animal Care and Use

Committee at Virginia Tech (FIW 13-164). The
study did not involve capture or handling of any
live animals.

RESULTS

We evaluated 900 isolates from 150
fecal samples of wildlife (18 species) and
domestic cattle. Of these, 48.9% (n5900;
95% confidence interval [CI] 45.6–52.2%)
were confirmed as E. coli and subjected to
antibiotic susceptibility testing (Table 1).
No antimicrobial resistance was detected
in feces from domestic cattle. However,
43.4% (n5143; 95% CI 35.1–51.9%) of
wildlife fecal samples harbored E. coli
to one or more antibiotics
resistant
(Table 1). Multidrug-resistant
isolates
were identified in 13.9% (95% CI 8.8-
20.8%) of wildlife fecal samples (Table 1).
Resistance to each of
the 10 tested
antibiotics was detected among wildlife
fecal samples.

Resistance was high among human clin-
ical specimens (n5193) from the local
primary hospital; 94.3% of specimens (95%
CI 90.0–97.1%) were resistant to one or
more antibiotics and 68.9% (95% CI 61.9–
75.4%) were multidrug resistant. The E. coli
from wildlife, human clinical, and environ-
mental samples were resistant to a similar
spectrum of antibiotics (most commonly
ampicillin, doxycycline, streptomycin, tetra-
cycline, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole),
albeit at a lower prevalence in wildlife than in
humans (Fig. 2).

Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance
was influenced by life-history strategy of
the animal host species (Table 2). There
was a significant difference in both the
overall prevalence of resistance (P50.006)
and in multidrug resistance (P50.001)
among carnivores, omnivores, and herbi-
vores (Table 2). Resistance was more
prevalent in carnivores, followed by omni-
vores, and herbivores. Multidrug resis-
tance was significantly more prevalent in
water-associated than nonwater-associated
species (P50.006; Table 2). Similarly,
multidrug resistance was significantly more
prevalent in wildlife from the unprotected

DISCUSSION

This study is one of few to examine
antimicrobial resistance in a broad range
of hosts (both in absolute numbers and
breadth of species) in their natural envi-
ronment
(Gordon and Cowling 2003;
Benavides et al. 2012; Lescat et al. 2013)
and the first to use a comparative life-
history study design to evaluate potential
mechanisms of exposure across different
land-use areas.

Resistance was widespread but not
ubiquitous among sampled animals, and
divergent life-history attributes—diet, wa-
ter association, and tolerance for humans/
urban and periurban occurrence—were
associated with increased accumulation of
antimicrobial resistance in the animal
species evaluated.

Apex predators act as important ecosys-
tem sentinels (or “condition indicators”),
as they are at the top of the food chain
(Sergio et al. 2008). In a compromised
ecosystem, trophic accumulation of pollu-
tants (Kannan et al. 2004), pesticides
(Newton 1979), and fecal coliforms
(Blackburn et al. 2010) can occur, threat-
ening a guild that already exists at lower
densities. In this investigation, diet ap-
pears to be an important factor in the
accumulation of resistance, where resis-
tance was higher in carnivores (leopard,
crocodile, otter, and hyena), followed by
omnivores (baboon, banded mongoose,
vervet monkey, and warthog) and last,
herbivores (all others). These findings
suggest that antimicrobial resistance may
follow a similar pattern of trophic accu-
mulation, as suggested elsewhere in red
foxes (Vulpes vulpes [Grobbel et al. 2012])
and birds of prey (Radhouani et al. 2014).
Water can be an important vehicle for
distributing fecal contaminants across the

landscape,
facilitating indirect contact
between humans and animals (Radhouani
et al. 2014). In this manner, water can act
as a powerful exposure medium for the
introduction of antimicrobial resistance
into naı¨ve populations (Mariano et al.
2009). Human fecal material can enter
waterways with stormwater runoff, sewage
system breaks, or flooding of septic tanks
(McCarthy et al. 2004), as well as direct
defecation and pollution from livestock
and wildlife when animals congregate
around water resources. In this investiga-
tion, water-associated species (those living
or foraging within the river system) har-
bored higher levels of antibiotic resistance
than nonwater-associated species. Con-
sumption of water alone was not associated
with resistance, however, as several water-
dependent species (consumption of water
due to physiological requirements) had
little or no evidence of exposure (e.g.,
impala, buffalo, cattle, and sable). Rather,
those species with aquatic or semiaquatic
life-history strategies (crocodile, hippopot-
amus, otter, and waterbuck) harbored
greater levels of multidrug-resistant E.
coli. These findings suggest that—among
other possible factors—the duration of
exposure and consumption of water-in-
undated vegetation and sediment might
be key to exposure and transmission of
resistant microbes. Indeed, among avian
species, waterfowl have been associated
with increased carriage of extended-
spectrum beta-lactamase–producing E. coli
and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (re-
viewed by Radhouani et al. 2014). In
addition to the gastrointestinal system of
warm-blooded animals, water and sedi-
ment can also be important habitats of
E. coli (Savageau 1983).

Accumulation of multidrug resistance in
wildlife is often attributed to anthropogen-
ic influence (Rolland et al. 1985; Skurnik
et al. 2006; Goldberg et al. 2007; Rwego
et al. 2008; Allen et al. 2010; Wheeler et al.
2012; Lescat et al. 2013). In this study,
multidrug resistance was significantly
more common in the unprotected urban/

periurban area where most human activity
occurs (Table 2). Supporting this, human
and wildlife E. coli isolates from the same
ecosystem demonstrated similar patterns
of resistance to antimicrobials (Fig. 2).
Furthermore, antibiotic resistance was
prevalent in several species with a tendency
to associate with humans,
including ba-
boon, banded mongoose, and warthog
(i.e., peridomestic species). This is consis-
tent with other studies where animals
foraging in human settlements and refuse
dumps harbored significant amounts of
antibiotic-resistant bacteria (Rolland et al.
1985; Pesapane et al. 2013). More impor-
tantly, although these species are coupled
with humans through waste utilization,
individuals can move across unprotected
and protected land areas, connecting
human populations with a myriad of other
wildlife species across the ecosystem and
providing a mechanism by which antibiot-
ic-resistant microbes may be distributed
throughout the landscape.

In the absence of more specific molec-
ular investigations, we cannot exclude the
possibility that the source of the antibiotic
resistance in some cases was not human.
The development of antimicrobial resis-
tance is a complex phenomenon, arising
by direct selection from clinical or agri-
cultural antibiotic use, independent selec-
tion by naturally occurring heavy metals
and antibiotics, or via the transfer of
naturally occurring resistance elements
from environmental bacteria (Allen et al.
2010; Wellington et al. 2013). The pres-
ence of antimicrobial resistance in wildlife
also does not necessarily imply direct
transmission from humans (Benavides et
al. 2012), and horizontal gene movement
readily occurs in areas of high microbial
density (Salyers et al. 2004; Schlu¨ ter et al.
2007), allowing resistance determinants to
be exchanged between microorganisms.
Molecular evaluations, such as repetitive-
element PCR (Goldberg et al. 2006), will
be essential to determine the dynamics of
transmission in this system, and are un-
derway in our laboratory.

The presence of antibiotic-resistant
E. coli in this system is of grave concern
because of
the potential of wildlife to
contribute to movement of resistance
through the system (Guenther et al.
2011; Radhouani et al. 2014). Botswana
has one of the highest rates of human
immunodeficiency virus/acquired immu-
nodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) in the
world (Piot et al. 2001), and this epidemic
has created a population highly vulnerable
to disease. Indeed, communicable diseases
(including malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuber-
culosis) are responsible for 45% of deaths
each year in Botswana (World Health
Organization Regional Office for Africa
[WHO-AFRO] 2014). Alarmingly, we
demonstrated widespread resistance in
wildlife to several first-line antimicrobials
used in human medicine—ampicillin,
doxycycline, streptomycin,
tetracycline,
and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (com-
monly known as cotrimoxazole). Doxycy-
cline is a common antimalarial drug used
by visitors to Africa (Lobel et al. 2001),
cotrimoxazole is administered widely for
prophylaxis against opportunistic infec-
tions in HIV patients (WHO 2006), and
streptomycin is a first-line antituberculosis
drug (Shi et al. 2007). Resistance to these
front-line antimicrobials can necessitate
implementation of second- and third-line
antimicrobials, which—in developing
countries such as Botswana—may result
in increased morbidity and mortality
because of prohibitive costs or lack of
access to these drugs.

In this investigation, resistance was wide-
spread but not ubiquitous across species.
For example, no resistance was detected in
cattle, guinea fowl, kudu, sable, or vervet
monkey. Rather, key life-history traits
appeared to be associated with exposure,
revealing potentially important coupling
points for exposure and transmission of
antimicrobial-resistant E. coli among
humans, wildlife, and the environment.
Water clearly plays a focal but complex role
in transmission of resistance elements, and
diet may increase the risk of exposure to

antimicrobial-resistant organisms through
trophic accumulation. Capitalizing on their
role as potential sentinels of aquatic and
terrestrial ecosystems, long-term monitor-
ing of antimicrobial resistance among apex
predators, water-, and human-associated
species may support
improved surveil-
lance, detection, and control of the spread
of antimicrobial resistance across the
landscape. This novel approach may be
applied to other ecosystems, facilitating
early detection of antimicrobial resistance
epidemics.

As we lose our pharmacological arsenal
to fight infectious diseases, emerging, re-
emerging, and persistently occurring
pathogens will
find new windows of
opportunity to invade, with dire conse-
quences for public health. The use of
sentinel wildlife as ecosystem indicators
and identification of points of microbial
connectivity will enable more focused
surveillance and management of
the
antimicrobial resistance crises.
