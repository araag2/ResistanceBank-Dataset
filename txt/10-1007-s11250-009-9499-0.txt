Abstract Enterococci and Salmonella were isolated
from feces of chicken in intensive poultry farms and
cattle which are maintained following traditional
practices. Their resistance to different antibiotics was
also determined. A total of 298 enterococcal isolates
consisting of Enterococcus faecium (49.6%), Entero-
coccus durans (26.9%), Enterococcus hirea (11.9%),
and Enterococcus faecalis (11.5%) were obtained.
Among the enterococci, resistance to erythromycin
(Ery), clindamicin (Cli), amoxicillin (Amo), ampicil-
lin (Amp), and cephalothin (Cep) was high. Resis-
tance to vancomycin (Van) was detected in all
enterococcal species. Over 80% of
the isolates
showed multiple drug resistance. The most dominant
patterns in poultry were Amo/Amp/Cep/Pen and
Amo/Amp/Cep/Cli/Pen/Van. Among isolates from
cattle, Amo/Amp/Cep/Cli/Ery/Pen/Van and Amo/

Amp/Cli/Ery/Pen/Van constituted the most dominant
multiple resistance patterns. A total of 51 Salmonella
isolates were obtained from poultry (43/280) and
cattle (8/450). About 70% of the isolates had varying
resistance to the tested antibiotics. Multiple drug
resistance was observed in over 30% of the Salmo-
nella isolates. The most frequent resistance pattern
was Amo/Amp/Cip/Gen/Str in cattle and Amo/Amp/
Cep/Cip/Gen/Kan/Str in poultry. Enteroccoccal and
Salmonella isolates showed multiple resistance to
those antibiotics used in human and veterinary
medicine. The high frequency of isolation of resistant
enterococci is indicative of the wide dissemination of
antibiotic resistant bacteria in the farm environment.

Introduction

Despite the shrinking in size of arable land due to the
growing world population, the contribution of animal
productions towards meeting the need for more food
has been significant. However, microbiological safety
of animal foods is becoming a major concern

More than 85% of the Ethiopian population is
dependent on agriculture, and Ethiopia's livestock
population is the largest in Africa with 30,000,000
cattle, 24,000,000 sheep, 18,000,000 goats, 7,000,000
equines, 1,000,000 camels, and 53,000,000 poultry

(Mengistu 2005). A larger segment of the rural and
urban population is dependent on livestock for food
and generation of
income. Thus, many zoonotic
bacterial pathogens can reach humans through con-
sumption of contaminated foods and food products of
animal origin and through close contact with the
animals.

Over the years, bacterial pathogens have developed
resistance to various antibiotics. The main risk factor
for the increase in the antibiotic resistance is an
extensive use of antibiotics in human health and
agriculture (Lukasova and Sustackova 2003), which
leads to the emergence and dissemination of resistant
bacteria and resistant genes in animals and humans.
The veterinary use of antibiotics includes therapy,
prophylaxis, and growth promotion. Some antibiotic
are used both in veterinary and human medicine. The
antimicrobial agents used in animal care are impor-
tant, not only in increasing the resistance in animal
pathogens, but also in bacteria transmitted from
animals to humans (Aarestrup et al. 2008).

The frequently exposed microbes during the use of
antibiotics for these purposes are the gut flora and,
hence, there is a possible development of resistance in
the pathogenic and commensal bacteria. The com-
mensal bacteria constitute a reservoir of resistant
genes for possible transfer to pathogenic bacteria.
Their level of resistance is considered as a good
indicator of the selection pressure of antibiotic use
and for resistance problem to be expected in patho-
gens (Bonomo and Rossolini 2008).

Enterococci are the normal flora of intestinal tract
of humans and animals. The genus consists of more
than 20 species, but fecal enterococci consist of
mainly four species: Enterococcus faecalis, Entero-
coccus faecium, Enterococcus durans, and Entero-
coccus hirae (Tejedor et al. 2001).

In human medicine, nosocomial and opportunistic
infections caused by enterococci are becoming in-
creasingly important problems, particularly those due
to E. fecalis and E. faecium (Wassenaar and Silley
2008) with resistance to a number of antibiotics.
Besides, enterococci serve as reservoir for transferable
resistance genes to other pathogens (Sahlström et al.
2009).

There is considerable information on antimicrobial
resistance in Salmonella of human and food animal
origin in Ethiopia and it has emerged as a consider-
able public health concern worldwide (Molla et al.

2003). This is due to the possible transfer of resistant
Salmonella and other zoonotic bacterial pathogens or
their resistant genes to humans through consumption
of contaminated food and food products (Van Hao et
al. 2007).

The aim of this study was, therefore, to assess the
distribution of antibiotic resistance among enterococ-
cal and Salmonella isolates from feces of poultry in
intensive poultry farms and cattle reared following
traditional practices.

Materials and methods

Collections of samples

Two hundred eighty cloacal swabs and 450 fecal
samples were collected from poultry and cattle,
respectively. The poultry samples were obtained from
cloaca of chicken using sterile swabs from four
intensive farms. Samples from cattle (30 g) were
collected from Addis Ababa and its surroundings in
sterile Stomacher bags (Seward 400, UK). The
samples were transported to the laboratory using
icebox and were processed within 1–2 days after
arrival to the laboratory.

Microbiological analysis

Fecal samples collected from different poultry farms
were streaked on Bile Esculin Agar (Oxoid). The
plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Colonies
which were considered as presumptive Enterococci
were further tested for the following characteristics.

Cell shape and arrangement was determined
microscopically. Production of catalase was tested
by flooding colonies with a 3% H2O2 solution. Test
for Gram reaction was carried out using potassium
hydroxide test according to Gregerson (1978).

Growth at 6.5% NaCl was tested in Brain heart
infusion broth (BHI) which contained 6.5% NaCl.
The inoculated broth was then incubated for 24 h at
35°C. Growth was visually detected. Growth at 45°C
was tested in BHI broth incubated at 45°C for 24 h.
Growth was visually detected.

Tests for carbohydrate fermentation were per-
formed in a broth basal medium containing phenol
red as indicator. Mannitol, sorbitol, sorbose, raffinose,
lactose, and arabinose were separately added to the

medium at 1% concentration. An overnight broth
culture of each isolate was separately inoculated into
each of the fermentation tubes and incubated at 37°C
for 24 h. The result was considered positive when the
broth turned yellow.

For Salmonella, rectal swabs from chicken were
vortexed vigorously in buffered peptone water (1%)
to suspend the contents. Fresh fecal samples from
cattle were homogenized by vortexing in buffered
peptone water (1%). These were incubated at 37°C
for 18–24 h for primary enrichment. Selenite broth,
tetrathionate broth, Rappaport-Vassiliadis, and man-
initol selenite broth and Muller-Kauffman tetrathio-
nate broth were prepared as secondary enrichment
according the instruction of the manufacturer. Plating
was done on MacConkey agar no 3, Salmonella-
Shigella agar, and xylose lysine desoxycholate. All
agar media and broths were from Oxoid.

Suspected Salmonella colonies were tested for the
following biochemical tests. Triple sugar iron agar,
lysine iron agar, urea agar, Simmons citrate agar,
medium sulphur
indole motility, mannitol broth,
sucrose broth (1%), and glucose broth. Presumptive
Salmonella isolates were further confirmed by using
API 20E identification system as described by the
manufacture (BioMerieux, France)

Drug susceptibility testing

Resistance was tested on Mueller–Hinton agar plates
following the standardized disk diffusion technique
(Jorgenson et al., 1999) with Oxoid drug disks:
ampicillin (Amp; 10 µg), sulfamethoxazole/trimetho-
prim (SXT; 25 µg), penicillin G (Pen; 10iu), vanco-
mycin (Van; 30 µg), erythromycin (Ery; 15 µg),
doxycycline (Dox; 30 µg), streptomycin (Str; 10 µg),
clindamycin (Cli; 2 µg), cephalothin (Cep; 30 µg);
amoxacillin (Amx; 25 µg), and amikacin (Ami;
30 µg).). All antibiotic disks were from Oxoid. For
Salmonella, ciprofloxacin (Cip; 5 µg) was included
but Cli, Ery, and Van were not used. The reference
strains, S. aureus (ATCC 6538) and E. coli (ATCC
25922), sensitive to all the drugs used in this study,
were routinely tested. Interpretation of readings as
sensitive,
resistant was made
according to a chart
(Jorgenson et al. 1999).
Intermediate readings were few and, therefore, con-
sidered as sensitive for the purpose of assessing the
data.

intermediate, or

Data analysis

Descriptive statistics was used to compute percentage
and mean. Analysis of variance was used to see
variation in resistant isolate among farms and species
for the different antibiotics tested. A difference was
considered statistically significant when the p value
was less than 0.05

Results

Of the 280 chickens sampled from four intensive
poultry farms (farms A, B, C, and D), 234 yielded
isolates consisting of E. faecium (49.6%), E. durans
(26.9%). E. hirea (11.9%) and E. faecalis (11.5%;
Table 1). Of the fecal samples collected from 450
cattle, 64 were positive for enterococci and consisted
of E. faecium (34), E. faecalis (nine), and E. durans
(21). E. hirea was not encountered in cattle.

The overall prevalence of Salmonella isolates from
poultry was 15.4% (43/280). The prevalence in farms
A, B, C, and D was 18.6% (13/70), 20% (14/70),
15.7% (11/70), and 7.1% (5/70), respectively. Out of
450 cattle fecal samples, only 1.8% (8/450) were
positive for Salmonella

Of the 234 poultry isolates subjected to antimicro-
bial susceptibility testing, using a panel of 11 different
antimicrobials, 40-80% of enterococci showed resis-
tance to Pen, Cli, Cep, Amo, or Amp. Resistance to
the other antimicrobials was less than 40%. All
isolates of E. faecalis showed susceptibility to Ami.
Van resistance was observed in the four species with a
frequency between 30 and 54% (Table 2). Van
resistance was observed in all poultry farms with
varying frequencies. All isolates from farm D also
showed resistance to Pen, Cli, and Cep (Table 2).
There was a significant difference among farms in
mean resistant isolates to Pen and Van (p<0.05).

Multiple drug resistance (MDR) to three or more
antibiotics was seen in 78.2% of the enterococcal
isolates. Resistance was noted to four, five, six, seven,
and more antibiotics at varying proportions. A smaller
percentage of isolates were also resistant to ≥10 or 11
antibiotics (Table 3).

E. hirea had the largest proportion of multiple drug
resistance (91.2%). E.
faecalis, E. durans, and E.
faecium accounted for 81.5%, 79.4%, and 73.3%,
respectively. Higher number of resistance pattern was

MDR was observed in all four farms, but
it was
relatively higher in farms A and D (92% each). In
farms B and C, the frequency of MDR was ≤80%.

Of the 64 enterococcal isolates from cattle, more
than 70% showed resistance to Pen, Ery, Cli, or Amo.
Resistance to Van was observed in all
the three
species isolated from cattle but was relatively higher
among E. faecalis isolates. MDR was observed in 58
of the 64 enterococcal isolates. In E. faecium alone,
multiple drug resistance was seen in 15 different

resistance patterns (data not shown) dominated by
eight frequent patterns (Table 3)

Of the 65 Salmonella isolated from poultry tested
for an array of eight different antimicrobials, 38 were
resistant to Str, none was resistant to Ami, and the
resistance to the other antimicrobials was less than
50%. Sixteen isolates from poultry showed MDR to
three or more antimicrobials. None of the resistance
patterns was dominant. Of
the nine Salmonella
isolates from cattle, three isolates were resistant to
Str and Amo. Resistance to Kan, Cep, and Ami were

Discussion

Our finding showed that E. faecium was the dominant
species in poultry, followed by E..durans, E. hirea,
and E. faecalis. The absence of E. hirea in cattle in
this study is distinctly different from the study in
Kansas where E. hirea was the most abundant
(Anderson et al. 2008)

Supplementing animal

feed with antimicrobial
agents to enhance growth has been a common
practice for more than 30 years and is estimated to
constitute more than half the total antimicrobial use
worldwide (Mathew et al. 2007). The use of anti-
biotics for gaining these benefits selects resistant
bacteria in the farms. In our study, the magnitude of
resistance to different antimicrobials was distributed
across all Enterococcus spp. isolated from poultry.
The development of resistance to most antibiotics
with different modes of action is considered to be a
serious public health concern and the problem becomes
more severe in developing counties like Ethiopia.

About 50% or more of our E. faecium isolates were
resistant to six different drugs, and resistance to Cli
and Pen was higher than that reported from Japan
(Yoshimura et al. 2004) and USA (Hayes et al. 2004),
respectively, but resistance to Amp was lower than
that reported from Botswana (Chingwaru et al. 2003).
Over 50% of E. faecalis isolates were resistant to
Amp and this frequency is higher than that reported
from Japan and USA (Yoshimura et al. 2004; Hayes
et al. 2004).

Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are an
emerging international threat to public health all over
the world. Van resistance in our study was higher than
that reported from USA and Australia (Consumers
2003), New Zealand (Manson et al. 2004), and Korea
(Seong et al. 2004). However, this figure is far less
than the report from Sweden (79%; Sahlström et al.
2009). Delayed resistance to Van was detected in a
few Enterococcus isolates from animal feces obtained
from five European countries (de Jong et al. 2009).
The occurrence of Van resistance in 44% of poultry
isolates and 17.2% of cattle dung isolates in our study
was markedly higher than in those isolates from
clinical specimen in Iran (4.38%; Akhi et al. 2009)
and hospitalized patients, out-patients, and healthcare

workers from Ethiopia where no Van resistant isolate
was found (Worku 2005). This would indicate that,
although Van resistance was not detected from human
specimen, its wide distribution in poultry and cattle
population is a public health threat, as the resistant
strains could easily find their way in the human food
chain. E.
faecium are the most
common causative agents of nosocomial infections
and our isolates from cattle and poultry had developed
resistance to Vancomycin, which is the last drug of
choice for infection caused by these species. Risk
assessment studies have shown that chicken contrib-
uted more risk than other animal products in
transmitting resistant enterococci to humans (Presi et
al. 2009). However, recent pulsed field gel electro-
phoresis studies showed that transmission of resistant
enterococci from animal sources to humans or vice
versa were less common (Katsunuma et al. 2008).

Multiple resistance of enterococcal isolates in our
study to three or more drugs was higher than the
isolates from USA and Australia (Wallinga et al.
2002; Consumers 2003.) Since use of antibiotics in
the farm environment in Ethiopia is not widespread,
the resistance genes might be imported from abroad
with the live chicks where antibiotic use is part of
modern agriculture. The dissemination of resistance
may be favored by the poor
farm management
practice in Ethiopia. We isolated VRE from the four
farms considered in the study, but the proportion of
the isolates that showed resistance varied among
farms. Farm A (50% VRE isolates) and farm B
(36.7% VRE isolates) commonly imported breeder
(parent stock) and sometimes day-old chicks. In the
process, resistance bacteria and genes might also be
imported. These farms multiply and distribute chick-
ens to other farms, small-scale producers, and directly
to farmers or via Bureau of Agricultures and non-
governmental organizations.

The proportion of multiple drug resistant isolates in
our study was higher than the isolates from hospital-
ized patients, outpatients, and healthcare workers
from Ethiopia (Worku 2005). This widespread dis-
semination of MDR isolates in food animals (cattle
and poultry) may,
thus, be a possible risk for
acquisition of MDR by humans.

In the present study, resistance to eight antibiotics
was observed in all the three enterococcal species
isolated from cattle. The development of resistance to
these drugs especially in E. faecium and E. faecalis,
which are known to cause opportunistic infections in
humans, is a point of concern. If these isolates pass
through the food chain and establish in humans to
cause infections, the treatment options become limited
and, are thus, considered a serious public health
threat.

Prevalence of Salmonella in poultry considered in
our study was higher than that reported from Belgium
(Van Hoorebeke et al. 2008) and Germany where no
Salmonella was isolated from broiler flocks (Pieskus
et al. 2008). Our result, however, was comparable to
that obtained from the Netherlands (Pieskus et al.
2008) and India (Murugkar et al. 2005), but lower
than the rate observed in the USA (Hayes et al. 2004)
and Botswana (Gaedirelwe and Sebunya 2008). The
prevalence of Salmonella in cattle in our study was
far less than the result obtained from healthy cattle in
USA. (Oloya et al. 2007). The prevalence in poultry

Trop Anim Health Prod (2010) 42:857–864

863

was higher than that in cattle, possibly because of the
high density stocking in poultry which may facilitate
horizontal
transmission of pathogen (Barbour and
Nabbut 1982). In Ethiopia, cattle graze in the open
and the chance for horizontal transmission of patho-
gens is limited.

The frequency of Salmonella isolates resistant to
one or more antibiotics was much higher than that
observed in US dairy cows (Lundin et al. 2008). This
indicated the wider dissemination of resistant isolates
both in intensive and conventional farming systems in
Ethiopia.

Resistance of Salmonella to the commonly used
antibiotics in human medicine such as that to Str,
Amo, Amp, and Gen was observed in this study at
higher frequency in those isolates from cattle and
poultry. Results of the present study indicated the
potential importance of cattle and chicken as a source
of single and multiple antimicrobial resistant Salmo-
nella isolates to commonly used antibiotics. Further
detailed molecular studies are essential on the
frequency, source of acquisition of resistant genes,
and distribution of resistant pathogens, known or
opportunistic, among food animals, food products,
and humans in Ethiopia.
