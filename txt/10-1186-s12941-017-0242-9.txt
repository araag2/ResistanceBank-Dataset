Abstract 
Background:  Staphylococcus aureus is the predominant bacterium responsible for various diseases in animals and 
humans. Preventive strategies could be better implemented by understanding the prevalence, genetic patterns, and 
the presence of enterotoxin and biofilm-producing genes along with the antibiotic susceptibility of this organism. 
This study was conducted in Rajasthan, the northwestern state of India, holding the largest population of cattle that 
makes it the second largest milk producer in India and no such prior information is available on these aspects.
Methods:  A total of 368 individual quarter bovine raw milk samples were collected from 13 districts of Rajasthan, and 
screened for the presence of S. aureus. Microbiological and molecular approaches were followed for bacterial identi-
fication. Genetic diversity was determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism 
(PCR–RFLP) of coagulase gene (coa), whereas enterotoxin and biofilm-producing genes were studied by PCR analysis. 
Antibiotic strips were employed to study the antibiotic resistance among strains.
Results:  In all, 73 S. aureus strains were obtained from 368 bovine raw milk samples out of that only 30 showed the 
presence of coa. Nine types of coa patterns ranging from 730 to 1130 bp were observed among these isolates. PCR–
RFLP of coa distinguished the isolates into 15 genotypic patterns, of which patterns I, IV, V, and VI were predominant. 
Of the isolates, 30% were positive for sec, 10% for sea, and 3.3% for seb; these genes are responsible for enterotoxin 
production, whereas all isolates were found positive for icaAD and eno. The prevalence rates of other biofilm-pro-
ducing genes fnbA, clfB, ebpS, sasG, fnbB, sasC, cna, bap, fib and, bbp were 97, 93, 90, 80, 80, 77, 53, 27, 10, and 6.6%, 
respectively. Twenty-seven (90%) strains were multidrug resistant, of which 15 were methicillin resistant. Maximum 
sensitivity was reported for kanamycin and it could be considered as a drug of choice for controlling S. aureus medi-
ated cattle infections in the studied regions.
Conclusions:  Overall, these strains could cause several diseases to humans, insisting the need for developing a 
stricter hygiene program for improving milking practices and animal health.

Background
The  dairy  sector  in  India  has  grown  substantially  over 
the  years,  making  India  the  world’s  largest  producer  of 
milk [1], and Rajasthan, the northwestern state of India, 
has the largest number of cattle that makes it the second 
largest milk producer in India [2]. However, the yield of 
animals within the state is not satisfactory due to various 
production diseases and is understood as the major fac-
tor responsible for economic losses to the dairy industry 
in India [3, 4].

Subclinical mastitis (SCM) with no sign of inflamma-
tion is more severe than clinical forms and is responsible 
for a huge loss to the dairy industry [5, 6]. Staphylococcus 
aureus is a part of the normal gut microbiota [7] but is 
also  a  predominant  microorganism  implicated  in  clini-
cal  mastitis  and  SCM  [8]  and  is  difficult  to  eliminate. 
The pathogenic strains of S. aureus are generally coagu-
lase  positive  and  reported  to  cause  illness  in  their  host 
around the world [9]. From the infected udders, S. aureus 
directly  passes  into  the  raw  milk  and  affects  the  qual-
ity of milk and makes the milk less suitable for further 
product formulations (e.g., cheese, paneer [a soft, white 
cheese]). In India, 85% of total milk produced is handled 
by  the  noncommercial  sector  [1].  Therefore,  the  direct 
consumption and transformation of such milk into tra-
ditional  dairy  foods  increase  the  chances  of  associated 
infections  because  of  improper  storage  and  transporta-
tion facilities. The hygiene present in dairies and the lit-
eracy of handlers about safe milk production in Rajasthan 
are  below  satisfactory  level  [10].  For  the  effective  con-
trol measures of S. aureus, its genetic characterization is 
necessary [11, 12]. Coagulase gene (coa) typing has been 
proven  to  be  the  most  successful  method  to  discrimi-
nate isolates at the strain level, recovered from different 
regions, mainly because of simple, accurate, and repro-
ducible  results  obtained  with  this  technique  over  other 
methods [13–15].

Multiple virulence factors have been suspected for the 
pathogenicity of S. aureus, among which the production 
of  enterotoxins  and  toxic  shock  syndrome  toxin–1  and 
the ability to form biofilms are important and worrisome 
for the food industry [16, 17]. Staphylococcal enterotox-
ins (SEs) are heat-stable; therefore, they may retain their 
biological  activity  even  after  pasteurization  and  various 
processing  steps.  An  accidental  ingestion  of  SEs  causes 
several gastrointestinal disorders in the host [18].

Biofilm-producing  S.  aureus  strains,  especially  the 
enterotoxigenic  and  antibiotic-resistant  ones,  are  the 
major  cause  of  several  persistent  bacterial  diseases  in 
the livestock sector, including mastitis [19]. During bio-
film formation, initially, the bacteria adhere to each other 
by polysaccharide intercellular adhesion (PIA) and then 
propagate. The PIA is under the control of the icaADBC 

operon, and the strains possessing this gene cluster have 
been reported as strong biofilm producers [20]. In addi-
tion, several other surface markers have been reported to 
play a crucial role in biofilm formation, specifically called 
as  microbial  surface  components  recognizing  adhesive 
matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs) such as collagen-bind-
ing protein (Cna) and elastin-binding protein (Ebps). The 
formation  of  biofilm  also  provides  a  shielding  effect  to 
the bacterium from antibiotic attacks.

To  tackle  S.  aureus-mediated  infections,  antibiotics 
are used by veterinary professionals but their therapeu-
tic outcomes are nearly insignificant because of the stub-
born  nature  of  the  pathogen  [21].  The  frequent  use  of 
antibiotics leads to the evolution of antibiotic-resistance 
genes in S. aureus that can be easily transferred among 
healthier commensals and to other animals and humans 
by  close  interactions  [9].  Studying  the  response  of  S. 
aureus to different relevant antibiotics gives the present 
drug resistance scenario from a region and the measure 
of associated risk factors. In addition, it may also help in 
selecting a more effective drug from a veterinary clinical 
point of view.

Therefore,  the  aims  of  this  study  were  to  check  the 
prevalence  of  S.  aureus  from  bovine  raw  milk  sam-
ples  and  determine  the  genetic  heterogeneity,  virulence 
potential,  and  antimicrobial  susceptibility  of  S.  aureus 
from different regions of Rajasthan. These tasks were per-
formed to generate useful information for field veterinar-
ians and policy makers to form strategies for controlling 
S. aureus-mediated infections and ultimately improving 
the quality of milk.

Methods
Milk sampling and microbiological analysis
From May 2014 to November 2015, 368 individual quarter 
bovine raw milk samples were collected from 13 districts 
of  Rajasthan,  India  (Fig.  1).  The  samples  were  randomly 
taken  from  clinically  healthy  animals.  The  samples  were 
collected  from  different  dairy  herds,  and  before  sam-
pling, the teats of animals were cleaned with cotton balls 
soaked  with  70%  alcohol  and  the  first  few  milliliters  of 
milk were discarded. The samples were maintained at 4 °C 
before processing in a laboratory. The samples were seri-
ally diluted in 2% peptone water, and 100 µL of each sam-
ple  was  poured  onto  S.  aureus  chromogenic  agar  plates 
(HiMedia Laboratories, Mumbai, India) containing poly-
myxin B (50 unit/mL). After 24-h of incubation at 37 °C, 
Staphylococcus  colonies  showing  blue-green  color  from 
each sample were transferred to brain heart infusion (BHI) 
broth. The chromogenic mixture present in the medium 
is specifically cleaved by S. aureus to produce blue-green 
colonies, which are clearly visible against the opaque back-
ground. For reconfirmation, the cultures were streaked on

Mannitol salt agar and Baird Parker agar plates (Himedia 
Laboratories). Next, the colonies were examined for mor-
phology after Gram staining and were confirmed using the 
API  Staph  kit  (bioMeriux,  Marcy-l’Etoile,  France).  Con-
firmed  S.  aureus  colonies  were  examined  for  coagulase 
activity by tube plasma agglutination test. The presump-
tively  identified  S.  aureus  colonies  were  maintained  at 
−80 °C in glycerol stocks for further analysis. A single col-
ony was picked per positive sample and used to determine 
the prevalence rate among different samples. The isolates 
were coded conforming to their origin.

DNA extraction and purification
Genomic DNA was extracted from a freshly grown cul-
ture  in  BHI  broth  by  using  a  modified  method  [22]. 
Briefly, 2 mL of overnight grown culture was centrifuged 
at 12,000×g for 10 min to form pellets. Afterwards, the 
pellets  were  resuspended  in  200  µL  of  sucrose  EDTA 
Tris  (SET)  buffer  containing  lysostaphin  (100  µg/mL; 
Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) and lysozyme (100 µg/
mL; Amersco, Solon, USA) for 1 h at 37 °C. The remain-
ing  procedure  was  similar  as  described  elsewhere 
[22].  The  extracted  DNA  was  examined  for  purity  and 

concentration using a microplate reader at 260 nm and 
thereafter stored at −20 °C.
All conventionally identified S. aureus were ascertained 
by  species-specific  primers  (F  5′-CCATGTGTAGCGG 
TGAAATG–3′  and  R  5′-TAAGGTTCTTCGCGTTG 
CTT–3′) obtained from the 16S rRNA region of S. aureus 
(GenBank  accession  number:  KF993676.1)  by  using 
Primer  3  plus  software.  A  25-µL  PCR  reaction  mixture 
consisting of 12.5 µL of 2X DreamTaq Green PCR Master 
Mix (Thermo Scientific, Mumbai, India), 0.5 µM of each 
primer, and 1 µL of template DNA was prepared and per-
formed  in  a  SureCycler  8800  Thermal  Cycler  (Agilent 
Technologies, New Delhi, India). Following program was 
used for PCR cycles: 2 min at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles 
of 30 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 57 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C with a final 
extension of 10 min at 72 °C. A PCR product of approxi-
mately 306 bp signifies the presence of S. aureus isolates.
Using an earlier protocol, coa was identified in the S. 
aureus  isolates  [23].  The  amplified  products  were  elec-
trophoresed  on  2.0%  agarose  gel  at  100  V  for  1  h  and 
photographed  in  a  gel  documentation  system  (BioRad 
Laboratories, Gurgaon, India). A suitable ladder was used 
as the size marker during electrophoresis.

Restriction enzyme digestion of PCR‑amplified coa product
Of the PCR-amplified coa product, 10 µL was mixed with 
17 µL of nuclease-free water, 2 µL of buffer Tango, and 
1 µL of AluI (Thermo Scientific) and incubated at 37 °C 
for 1 h for digestion. The digested products were resolved 
on 2.0% agarose gel and examined in a gel documenta-
tion  system.  A  100–1500-bp  ladder  (Promega,  Wiscon-
sin, USA) was used as the size marker for analyzing the 
digested coa fragments.

The  generated  Coa-RFLP  patterns  were  analyzed  by 
the BioNumerics (version 7.6) software package (Applied 
Maths,  Sint-Martens-Latem,  Belgium).  A  dendrogram 
was  prepared  by  using  the  Dice-coefficient  and  the 
unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages 
as the cluster analysis method.

Reproducibility testing
PCR reproducibility was analyzed by testing five isolates 
for five consecutive days. The PCR–RFLP reproducibility 
of coa was determined by digesting four products twice 
with the AluI enzyme.

Calculating numerical index of discrimination
A numerical index equation was used to determine the 
discriminatory power of the typing method as described 
previously [24]. The following formula was used:

D = 1 −

1

N (N − 1)

s
(cid:31)
j=1

nj(nj − 1)

where D = discriminatory index, s = total number of dif-
ferent types, nj = number of isolates representing each 
type,  and  N  =  total  number  of  isolates  in  the  sample 
population.

Detection of enterotoxin and biofilm genes
The  amplification  of  the  genes  coding  for  enterotoxins 
and  biofilm  production  (Table  1)  was  performed  using 
the multiplex PCR method [25, 26].

Determination of minimum inhibitory concentration
The  minimum  inhibitory  concentration  (MIC)  of  all  S. 
aureus isolates was determined using E-strips as per the 
manufacturer’s  instructions  after  adjusting  their  OD  to 
McFarland  0.5  as  disclosed  previously  [27].  The  results 
obtained  were  analyzed  according  to  CLSI  guidelines 
[28].  The  MIC  E-strips  (0.016–256  µg/mL)  (HiMedia 
Laboratories)  were  used  for  susceptibility  observation. 
The antimicrobials used were according to the informa-
tion collected from the field veterinarians and practicing 
clinicians. S. aureus ATCC 29213 was used as the refer-
ence  strain  for  quality  control.  Methicillin-resistant  S. 
aureus  (MRSA)-positive  strains  were  further  confirmed 

on HiCrome MeReSa Agar (HiMedia Laboratories) and 
validated by the amplification of mecA by PCR [29].

Results
Out of 368 bovine raw milk samples, S. aureus contami-
nation  was  present  in  73  (19.84%)  samples  (Table 2)  as 
revealed  by  media  plating  analysis.  All  73  isolates  were 
found as S. aureus in API analysis. Out of the 73 isolates, 
30  (41.1%)  showed  coagulase  activity  and  were  further 
confirmed  as  S.  aureus  by  PCR.  Furthermore,  all  these 
phenotypically coagulase-positive S. aureus scored posi-
tive for coa during PCR analysis (Fig. 2). Nine types of 
coa patterns ranging from 730 to 1130 bp were observed 
(Table 3), and the sizes, 820 and 920 bp, were the most 
predominantly  noticed  product  sizes,  accounting  alto-
gether for 67% of the total coa-positive isolates (Table 3). 
Twenty-seven  isolates  depicted  one  PCR  band  while 
three  isolates  (15,  17,  and  19)  depicted  double  bands 
(Fig. 2). The polymorphism in coa was studied by RFLP 
(Fig. 3), where fifteen (I–XV) RFLP patterns (Table 3 and 
Fig. 4) were observed. RFLP patterns I, IV, V, and VI were 
the dominant patterns being noticed in three (10%), three 
(10%),  six  (20%),  and  four  (13.3%)  isolates,  respectively 
(Table 3). The isolates with the most predominant pattern 
(V)  displayed  two  DNA  fragments  of  540  and  260  bp. 
The isolates with pattern VI had DNA fragments of 565 
and 270 bp. The isolates with patterns I and IV had DNA 
fragments of 430 and 260 bp and 528 and 250 bp, respec-
tively. Rest all other remaining patterns were shown by a 
single (II, VII, X, XI, XII, and XIV) or two (VIII, IX, and 
XIII)  isolates.  The  reproducibility  of  the  PCR  products 
and coa PCR–RFLP was demonstrated with 100% of the 
repeatedly  tested  isolates;  however,  the  results  showed 
some variations in the intensity of bands.

The  discriminatory  index  for  the  AluI  RFLP  method 
was about 0.80, indicating a fair discriminatory power of 
this method for typing S. aureus. Further RFLP analysis 
classified the 30 S. aureus strains into five major clusters 
designated as A, B, C, D, and E (Fig. 4). The dendrogram 
depicted  that  cluster  A  was  40%  similar  to  other  clus-
ters  (B-D)  and  was  composed  of  isolates  obtained  from 
eight  regions.  Cluster  B  was  52%  identical  with  clus-
ters C to E and was composed of isolates obtained from 
three regions. Similarly, cluster C with approximately 82% 
identity with clusters D and E included isolates from four 
regions. Cluster D was composed of five isolates obtained 
from two regions. The remaining cluster E was composed 
of only one isolate that was derived from a totally different 
region.

Of  the  analyzed  enterotoxin  genes,  30%  isolates  were 
positive for sec, 10% for sea, and 3.3% for seb (Table 4). 
No isolate was detected harboring the remaining entero-
toxin genes.

Regarding  biofilm-encoding  genes,  all  isolates  typed 
100% positive for icaAD, icaBC, and eno (Table 5). The 
prevalence  rates  of  fnbA,  clfB,  ebpS,  sasG,  fnbB,  sasC, 
cna, bap, fib, and bbp were 97, 93, 90, 80, 80, 53, 77, 27, 
10,  and  6.6%,  respectively.  Low  prevalence  was  noticed 
for clfA (3.3%) as only one isolate was found positive for 
this gene.

Antibiotic susceptibility test revealed that 27 (90%) iso-
lates were resistant to penicillin, 23 (77%) to ampicillin, 

17 (57%) to amikacin, 15 (50%) to oxacillin, 12 (40%) to 
ciprofloxacin,  9  (30%)  to  azithromycin,  and  7  (23%)  to 
piperacillin (Table 6). Five (17%) isolates showed resist-
ance to linezolid and tetracycline; 3 (10%) to gatifloxacin 
and rifampicin; 2 (7%) to ceftazidime, chloramphenicol, 
and  norfloxacin;  and  1  (3%)  to  gentamicin,  teicoplanin,

of  the  strains  tested  showed  multiple  drug  resistance 

(complete or intermediate) to three or more antibiotics. 
All isolates were completely (100%) sensitive to kanamy-
cin.  Additionally,  15  strains  were  resistant  to  oxacillin, 
penicillin, and ampicillin along with other antibiotics and 
were considered as MRSA strains [9]. All 15 strains fur-
ther showed their presence on MeReSa Agar and found 
positive for mecA (Fig. 5).

Discussion
In this study, the prevalence, genetic patterns, pathogenic 
potential, and antibiotic susceptibility of S. aureus recov-
ered from 13 districts of Rajasthan, India, were discussed. 
Our results indicated that 19.84% of milk samples were 
positive for S. aureus, and to the best of our knowledge, 
this  is  the  first  comprehensive  study  from  Rajasthan. 
Similar findings concerning the prevalence of S. aureus 
in  bovine  raw  milk  samples  were  reported  from  differ-
ent sub-parts of India; however, the prevalence rate var-
ied greatly among the studies [30–36]. Of note, moderate 
prevalence was reported in the present study. We posit 
that inadequate hygiene and inferior management prac-
tices facilitate the entry of microorganisms to udders and 
concomitantly the shedding of microorganisms into milk.
The phenotypic method is not sufficient for categoriz-
ing  between  coagulase-positive  and  -negative  S.  aureus

Fig. 4  Dendrogram showing genetic heterogeneity among S. aureus isolates on the basis of the coa gene polymorphism

isolates [37]. Therefore, we examined the isolates for the 
coa presence by PCR. Nine coa PCR types were obtained, 
signifying  considerable  variation  among  the  S.  aureus 
types  and  this  finding  is  in  agreement  with  others  [14, 
23, 38]. The precise reason for this high rate of polymor-
phism  observed  among  the  strains  is  debatable.  How-
ever, because of the presence of a series of 81-bp tandem 
repeats in the 3′-end region of coa, the high rate of poly-
morphism possibly alters the antigenic properties of the 
gene.  Therefore,  the  gene’s  conformity  is  possibly  rec-
ognized as the topmost reason behind the failure in the 
action of neutralizing antibodies [39]. A double band for 
coa was also visualized among three isolates, indicating 
the existence of distinct allelic forms of coa. The appro-
priate  reason  behind  this  distinct  coa  pattern  is  linked 

to the production of more than one immunologic form 
of the coagulase protein by some S. aureus isolates [23], 
although  this  pattern  is  rarely  observed  and  only  a  few 
authors have reported it [38, 40].

In the present study, the digestion of the different coa 
amplicons  with  AluI  reveals  considerable  genetic  vari-
ability as it classifies them into 15 patterns. The findings 
are  similar  to  those  of  others  [14,  23,  41]  who  found  a 
considerable  degree  of  variability  in  coa  RFLP  patterns 
after digestion with the same enzyme, although the sizes 
of  PCR  products  obtained  here  were  almost  different 
from those in earlier studies. Besides, the typing method 
opted  for  the  discrimination  was  found  full-proof  as  it 
displayed a fairly good discriminatory power, i.e., of 0.80 
and is supported by the findings of Sarvari et al. [15] who

obtained a discriminatory index of 0.82 among S. aureus 
isolates.

As  mentioned  earlier,  the  study  segregated  all  30  S. 
aureus  isolates  into  five  clusters  (A–E),  among  which 
patterns  I,  IV,  V,  and  VI  were  predominant.  Most  pat-
terns belonged to clusters A and C. This indicates weak 
to no heterogeneity in the AluI recognition sites among 
the isolates of these predominant patterns. Momtaz et al. 
[14] found that out of 42 coa-positive S. aureus isolates, 
31 (73.8%) belonged to genotype pattern I and 11 (26%) 
to II. Likewise, in another study [39], pattern I was found 
predominant. These findings support our results and jus-
tify that in a particular geographical region a predominant 
genotype is present because of prevailing favorable envi-
ronmental conditions. Besides, the internal resistance of 
strains toward the host immune system also substantially 

plays  an  important  role  in  the  strain’s  dominance.  The 
predominant isolates from a region have possibly evolved 
mechanisms to bypass the host phagocytosis than the iso-
lates with rare genotypes [42, 43]. Furthermore, the exist-
ence of a similar RFLP pattern for intra-regional strains in 
genotypes, I, IV, V, VI, VIII, IX, and XIII suggests the pos-
sibility of transmission of some strains from one region to 
another during the transportation of milk.

Next,  we  tested  all  isolates  for  enterotoxin-producing 
genes  and  none  of  them  from  Ajmer,  Jaipur,  and  Chit-
torgarh  regions  scored  positive  for  these  genes.  In  our 
study, the genes for toxins (sed, see, eta, etb, and tst) were 
not amplified in any of the 30 isolates. Enterotoxins con-
tribute  to  the  pathogenesis  of  S.  aureus  by  modulating 
immunity  and  susceptibility  to  antibiotics  resulting  in 
the onset of many diseases [44]. The reports concerning

the  presence  of  enterotoxin-producing  genes  (sea,  seb, 
sec, sed, and see) among S. aureus strains isolated from 
milk  of  animals  with  bovine  mastitis  concur  with  our 
findings [44]. Here, we did not find the presence of eta 
and etb exfoliative genes, and these results are in agree-
ment  with  previous  studies  [11,  44,  45],  which  inferred 
that S. aureus strains isolated from animals with mastitis 
were rarely found positive for exfoliative toxins. Similarly, 
the  presence  of  tsst–1  was  not  observed  in  any  isolate, 
although its prevalence in isolates from cattle with masti-
tis was reported in conjunction with sec and sed [44].

Most  information  about  the  ability  of  S.  aureus  to 
form  biofilms  is  restricted  to  the  isolates  recovered 
from  clinical  studies  or  medical  devices,  and  insuffi-
cient  information  is  available  for  bovine  milk-derived 
isolates.  Therefore,  we  studied  MSCRAMM  genes  to 

understand their prevalence. The products of these genes 
aid  the  bacterium  to  adhere  to  the  host  components 
and  produce  biofilm.  Previous  studies  on  MSCRAMM 
genes  in  Enterococcus  faecium,  S.  saprophyticus,  and  S. 
aureus  mention  that  instead  of  their  active  role  in  bio-
film development, some gene products are also involved 
in  pathogenesis.  Here,  a  great  diversity  in  the  presence 
of  biofilm-producing  genes  was  observed  among  the 
isolates  recovered  from  different  regions.  The  complete 
dominance was observed for icaAD and eno responsible 
for  polysaccharide  intracellular  adhesion  and  laminin-
binding proteins that have a crucial role in bovine mas-
titis pathogenesis [46]. These findings are in agreement 
with  previous  studies  [26,  45,  47]  that  reported  higher 
prevalence rates for these genes. fnbA and fnbB that are 
usually  associated  with  invasive  diseases  [48]  were  also

with chronic bovine mastitis, was present in 7% of iso-
lates. This finding is consistent with the observations of 
Darwish and Asfour [45], who observed the presence of 
bap in 2.5 and 4.4% of S. aureus and coagulase-negative S. 
aureus isolates, respectively. Another gene fib, elucidated 
to have a crucial role in binding to extracellular matrix 
fibrinogen, was also detected in 10% of isolates. This find-
ing is different from the findings of Pereyra et al. [50] and 
Zuniga et al. [53] who reported a higher prevalence of 90 
and  71.7%,  respectively.  Altogether,  our  results  suggest 
that most strains had the biofilm-forming ability, which 
may facilitate in establishing intramammary gland infec-
tions in cattle. Moreover, this property varies from strain 
to  strain  and  depends  on  the  genetic  composition  and 
geographical evolution.

In  the  present  study,  the  observed  antibiotic  resist-
ance  level  was  relatively  high  (90%)  and  two  strains 
(STRMSH74  and  STRMBP12)  from  Sirohi  and  Bharat-
pur, respectively, were found to be most resistant. MRSA-
positive strains were observed from each area except for 
Pali, Bhilwara, and Hanumangarh; this finding is in agree-
ment with studies reporting varied MRSA prevalence in 
bovine milk [9, 43, 54]. No similarities in resistance pat-
terns  were  observed  among  the  strains  from  different 
regions except for one strain each from Jaipur (STRMJ3) 
and  Bikaner  (STRMBKN5).  The  inconsistencies  in  the 
resistance profile observed might be due to the excessive, 
indiscriminate use of a particular antibiotic in each geo-
graphical region for combating infections. This fact was 
established by similar findings in studies undertaken in 
the United States and European countries, where a lower 
resistance  profile  among  S.  aureus  isolates  was  noticed 
because of stricter use of antibiotics in veterinary practice 
[54]. In Rajasthan, β-lactams, macrolides, aminopenicil-
lins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, 
tetracyclines,  and  amphenicols  are  frequently  used  in 
veterinary clinical practices. However, resistance toward 
the less commonly used antibiotics such as vancomycin, 
teicoplanin, and rifampicin in veterinary practice is not 
fully understood. This is possibly due to the contamina-
tion from human handlers [18], as strains with rare and 
high  antibiogram  patterns  were  generally  isolated  from 
hospital settings because of a high antimicrobial pressure 
[54].  Earlier,  vancomycin-resistant  enterococci  strains 
were  isolated  from  tertiary  care  hospitals  in  Rajasthan 
[55,  56],  and  it  was  proved  that  the  gene  cluster  VanA 
was transferable from E. faecalis to S. aureus [57]. Simi-
larly, teicoplanin-resistant S. aureus strains were reported 
from  a  hospital  in  Jaipur,  Rajasthan  [57].  Thus,  consid-
erable attention is needed for treating the vancomycin-
resistant MRSA-induced infection. Based on our results, 
all  strains  were  sensitive  to  kanamycin,  and  it  could  be 
the drug of choice to treat S. aureus mediated infections.

found abundantly (97 and 80%, respectively) among the 
isolates in this study; these rates are comparable to those 
in other studies [20, 26]. Similarly, clfB encoding an Fn-
binding protein that facilitates S. aureus to establish nasal 
colonization [49] was also present in most (93%) strains. 
Proteins  EbpS,  SasG,  and  SasC,  which  play  a  consider-
able  role  in  maintaining  cell  density,  biofilm  accumula-
tion, and intercellular adhesion, were present in 90, 80, 
and 53% of isolates, respectively. These findings are com-
parable and in complete agreement with the findings of 
Tang et al. [26] who noticed a high prevalence of these 
genes. Another collagen-binding protein, Cna, which has 
been associated with virulence potential in rabbit models 
[48], was identified in 77% of isolates; this value is com-
parably higher than that reported by Pereyra et al. [50] 
but lower than others [20, 26]. Gene bbp, which is often 
found in the clinical strains of S. aureus and linked with 
bone infections, was only typed in a few (6.6%) isolates. 
The result is in accordance with the findings of Kot et al. 
[51] and Puacz et al. [52] who detected the presence of 
bbp in a few isolates of mastitis origin. Gene bap, whose 
protein was probably the first protein elucidated to have 
a  role  in  biofilm  formation  in  S.  aureus  and  associated

Overall,  our  results  clearly 

indicate  that  bovine 
raw  milk  samples  collected  from  different  regions  of 
Rajasthan  were  contaminated  with  coagulase-positive 
strains of S. aureus. Considerable variability in coa was 
observed, and genotypes I, IV, V, and VI were predomi-
nant. The close similarity in the RFLP pattern among the 
isolates  of  different  regions  suggested  the  transmission 
of isolates from one place to another by various means. 
The presence of enterotoxin and biofilm-producing genes 
among these strains poses a potential public health risk, 
as these strains may be implicated in milk-borne intoxi-
cations. Furthermore, the presence of multidrug-resistant 
and MRSA strains indicates the improper use of antibiot-
ics for mastitis control and is a growing health concern 
globally.  However,  all  strains  were  found  susceptible  to 
kanamycin, and it can be referred to as a drug of choice 
in case of mastitis infections in the regions included in 
the study. The information generated here might be use-
ful for concerned veterinarians in improving cattle health 
and  designing  strategies  for  better  and  safe  milk  pro-
duction.  This  will  not  only  lower  the  risk  of  associated 
food poisoning but also prevent the spread of antibiotic 
resistance in the regions. Future research is warranted to 
establish the relationship between the presence of these 
strains  in  milk  and  their  ability  to  cause  infections  in 
humans.
