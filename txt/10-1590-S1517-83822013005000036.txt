Abstract

Salmonella enterica is frequently associated with outbreaks of human salmonellosis, and products of
avian origin, such as eggs and chicken meat, are the main vehicles of its transmission. The present
study describes the occurrence of different serovars of Salmonella enterica and phagotypes of S.
enterica serovar Enteritidis in eggs destined for human consumption. Four thousand eggs obtained
from commercial egg laying farms and one thousand discarded hatching eggs from broiler farms,
which were acquired at farmers’ markets and informal shops, were analyzed. Salmonella spp. was
isolated from 52.0% of the discarded hatching eggs, in which the predominant serovar was Enteritidis
(84.6%), and the predominant Salmonella Enteritidis phagotype (PT) was PT7 (26.9%). Salmonella
spp. was not isolated from eggs obtained from commercial egg laying farms. The antimicrobial resis-
tance profile showed that 23.1% (n = 6) of the SE strains were resistant to nalidixic acid. The results
suggest that the consumption of discarded hatching eggs represents an important source of Salmo-
nella transmission to humans.

Introduction

Salmonellosis is considered an important zoonosis
and one of the most prevalent food-borne diseases. In
Brazil, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (SE) is fre-
quently associated with food-borne infections that gener-
ally involve the consumption of poultry meat and eggs as
well as their derivatives (Kottwitz et al., 2010). According
to the Central Laboratory of Parana State (LACEN), egg-
based foods were involved in 45.0% of the salmonellosis
outbreaks that occurred in the state in the period from 1999
to 2008. S. enteritidis predominated in samples isolated
from patients (87.8%) and foods (80.6%).

S. enteritidis has adapted to the breeding of birds in
commercial poultry farming; this pathogen probably occu-
pies the niche formerly occupied by the serovars S.

gallinarum and S. pullorum, which were the most impor-
tant sanitary problems before the adoption of control and
prevention measures. SE can infect birds without resulting
in clinical manifestations, which makes its detection diffi-
cult and facilitates its spread (Vaz et al., 2010). Moreover,
SE persists in the poultry industry due to its capacity for
vertical and horizontal transmission (Cardoso and Tessari,
2008).

Commercial eggs are from small laying hens reared in
cages. Hatching eggs are destined for the production of
1-day-old chicks and are produced by broiler breeders in
nests with wood shavings. In Brazil, discarded hatching
eggs are donated or sold to food-producing establishments;
they are even sold at farmers’ markets for human consump-
tion. Although studies have found contamination by SE in
less than 1% of commercial eggs (Gast and Holt, 2000), this

decarboxylation of lysine (Difco, USA) and hydrolysis of
urea (Difco, USA).

Brazil is the seventh leading world producer of com-
mercial eggs, and production in 2009 was approximately
580 million dozen eggs, of which 224 million were pro-
duced in the state of Parana (IBGE, 2010). The objective of
the present study was to determine the occurrence of Sal-
monella spp. in commercial eggs and discarded hatching
eggs destined for human consumption, to identify the most
common serovars and phagotypes, and to evaluate the
antimicrobial resistance profile of the strains isolated.

Materials and Methods

Eggs

A total of 5000 eggs collected in northwest region of
Paraná State, Brazil were analyzed, between August 2003
and December 2006. Three thousand eggs were obtained
from the commercial laying hen houses of poultry farms,
registered with the Federal Inspection Service of the Minis-
try of Agriculture, Ranching and Supply. One thousand
commercial laying hen eggs were acquired from small rural
producers, and 1000 discarded hatching eggs from broiler
hens were obtained in farmers’ markets and informal shops.

Isolation of Salmonellaspp.

The isolation of Salmonella spp. from the eggs was
performed as described by the AOAC (1995). The eggs
samples were divided into 250 samples comprising 20 eggs
each. Each sample was placed in sterile plastic bags and
added 200 mL of 1% buffered peptone water (Merk, Ger-
many). After washing by hand the surface of the eggs, the
rinse was placed in sterile plastic bag and incubated for 20 h
at 36 °C. For selective enrichment, 1 mL of pre-enrichment
was added to 10 mL of tetrathionate broth (Merk, Ger-
many) and 0.1 mL to Rappaport-Vassiliadis broth (Merk,
Germany). After incubation for 24 h at 41 °C, the enrich-
ments were plated onto xylose-lysine deoxycholate agar
(XLD) (Merk, Alemanha) and brilliant green agar with 4%
novobiocin (VB) (Merk, Germany), followed by incuba-
tion for 18 h at 36 °C. After the washing of surface, the eggs
of each sample were broken in a sterilized container for the
aseptic separating of the yolks. The yolks were pooled and
an aliquot of 25 g of the mixture was added in 225 mL of
1% buffered peptone water (Merck, Germany) and incu-
bated at 36 °C for 16-20 hours. Selective enrichment and
differential plating were performed using the same proce-
dures described for the eggshell rinses.

The colonies that were lactose negative and H2S pro-
ducers were submitted to biochemical screening for the fol-
lowing biochemical tests: growth in Simmons citrate (Bio-
bras, Brazil), motility and production of indole in sulfur
indole motility medium (Biobras, Brazil), production of
H2S and gas in triple sugar iron agar (Biobras, Brazil),

Serotyping and phagotyping were performed by the
Laboratory of Enterobacteria, Department of Bacteriology
of the Foundation Instituto Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil.

Evaluation of the antimicrobial resistance profile

Susceptibility to antimicrobials was evaluated by the
disk-diffusion technique of Bauer et al. (1966) based on the
recommendations of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (2006). The following antimicrobial agents were
tested (OXOID®): ampicillin (10 mg), chloramphenicol
(30 mg), nalidixic acid (30 mg), cefotaxime (30 mg), cipro-
floxacin (5 mg)
and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
(25 mg).

Statistical analysis

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the results was

carried out with Statistica 5.0.

Results and Discussion

In the 200 egg samples from commercial laying hen
houses, Salmonella spp. was isolated neither from the cul-
ture of the pooled yolks nor from the eggshells rinses. In
contrast, in the 50 samples of discarded hatching eggs, Sal-
monella spp. was detected in the pooled yolks (n = 3) and in
the rinses of eggshells (n = 23).

Contamination can occur from infection of the ovary
and oviduct of the hens (Thiagarajan et al., 1994, Myamoto
et al., 1997), but it usually occurs through the fecal elimina-
tion of bacteria, which later come into contact with the egg
(Gast and Beard, 1993). The risk of Salmonella transmis-
sion is greater when the contamination occurs by the depo-
sition of the bacteria on the eggshell with later penetration
into the egg, or even when the bacteria remain on the shell
providing cross-contamination (Téo and Oliveira, 2005).
The results presented here suggest that commercially laid
eggs that had been inspected and previously cleaned pres-
ent a lower risk to public health (Jones et al., 1995).

Discarded hatching eggs are produced in nests with a
bed of wood shavings and are not incubated when they have
shell defects, cracks, dirt or thin shells. The condition of
these eggs facilitates the passage of Salmonella on the sur-
face to internal egg structures, increasing the risk of con-
tamination (Oliveira and Silva, 2000).

According to the Instruçao Normativa No. 78/2003
(Brasil, 2003), at poultry farms where breeder hens are
monitored and at which positivity for S. enteritidis and S.
typhimurium has been confirmed, a certificate of “con-
trolled establishment” is only given after treatment of the
flock and subsequent negative laboratory results. In addi-
tion, during the treatment of the birds, the incubation of
their eggs is suspended. Therefore, it is essential that dis-

carded eggs from poultry farms positive for SE be identi-
fied and correctly handled because such eggs could be
inadvertently destined for human consumption, thus consti-
tuting an important source of salmonellosis.

Another aspect that should be considered in compar-
ing commercial eggs and discarded hatching eggs is the se-
lection of specific lines, based on zootechnical characteris-
tics of interest. Kingsley and Baèumler (2000) reported that
the ability of Salmonella serovars to cause infections, or
even to determine a carrier state, was correlated with the ge-
netic resistance of the poultry line.

Studies have been conducted to evaluate the capacity
of invasion, colonization and persistence of SE in different
lines of birds. Some researchers have noted that rapid-
growth birds, such as ROSS, which is the predominant line
among the broilers used in the poultry industry in Brazil,
are more susceptible of SE, resulting in a greater possibility
of spreading this pathogen (Kingsley and Baèumler, 2000,
Kramer et al., 2001, Berthelot-Hérault et al., 2003, Wigley,
2004, Calenge et al., 2010).

In the present study, the results of the isolation of Sal-
monella from discarded hatching eggs showed a significant
difference (p £ 0.05) between the isolation of Salmonella
spp. from the shell rinses (n = 23; 46.0%) and from the pool
of yolks (n = 3; 6.0%). Similar findings have been reported
in studies involving the isolation of Salmonella from the
eggs of commercial laying hens. Fehlhaber and Janetschke
(1995) analyzed 5.339 eggs from birds infected with Sal-
monella spp. and were able to isolate the microorganism in
4.19% of the samples from the shells, while the pathogen
was detected in only 0.20% of samples taken from the in-
side the eggs. Similarly, Oliveira and Silva (2000) exam-
ined 124 egg samples and isolated Salmonella in 9.6% of
the eggshells samples but only in 3.20% of the yolk sam-
ples.

The serotyping and phagotyping data from the iso-
lates of Salmonella spp. found in the discarded hatching
eggs are presented in Table 1. The predominant serovar was

Enteritidis, which was present in 84.60% (n = 22) of the
samples. SE emerged as a critical poultry problem and pub-
lic health concern in Brazil beginning in 1993. Epidemio-
logical studies suggest its entrance in Brazil most likely
occurred at the end of the 1980s via the importation of con-
taminated genetic material from a broiler poultry farm. As a
result, the growth of Brazilian poultry farming in the 1990s
created conditions that were favorable for the maintenance
and proliferation of SE in poultry flocks (Silva and Duarte,
2002).

The phagotyping of the SE strains detected three
phagotypes (PT), namely PT1, PT7 and PT9. Among the 14
typeable strains, 7 (50.0%) were PT7 (Table 1). Although,
in various countries, infection by SE is related to the con-
sumption of contaminated products of avian origin, the
prevalent PTs are not the same (Cox, 1995). According to
Laconcha et al. (1998), PT1 and PT7 can be derived from
PT4 by conversion. In the state of Parana, in the period
from 1999 to 2003, PT4 predominated as the strain respon-
sible for outbreaks of salmonellosis. However, in the period
from 2003 to 2006, there was a change in prevalence; PT9,
for which data are still scarce (Kottwitz et al., 2010), is cur-
rently the predominant strain.

Analysis of the antimicrobial resistance profile of the
samples revealed that of the 26 strains of SE isolated, 6
(23.10%) showed resistance to nalidixic acid. The others,
which included strains of other serovars, were found to be
susceptible to all the antimicrobials tested (Table 1). Unlike
the other serovars of S. enterica, SE was still sensitive to the
majority of the antimicrobials until recently (Molbak et al.,
2002). However, with the spread of SE in poultry farming,
antimicrobials have been utilized more intensively to mask
the infections by this pathogen (Silva and Duarte, 2002). As
a consequence, an increase in SE strains resistant to anti-
microbials, especially quinolones, has been observed (Vaz
et al., 2010).

Since 2009, according to data from the São Camilo
Laboratory, Maringá, Paraná State, Brazil, in the state of

Kottwitz et al.

Parana, there has been a significant reduction in the isola-
tion of Enteritidis from samples of avian origin, while
serovars such as S. Minnesota and S. Mbandaka have been
frequently detected. Nonetheless, the destination of dis-
carded hatching eggs needs to be discussed.

Just as SE emerged in poultry farming when strate-
gies were adopted to eradicate other serovars, it is possible
that current measures aimed at its elimination from broiler
hen farms will favor its substitution. Therefore, the pres-
ence of SE in discarded eggs observed in this study sug-
gests that this foodstuff poses a significant public health
concern, regardless of the serovar that predominates in
poultry flocks.

The spread of Salmonella may be controlled by ap-
propriate breeding conditions and decontamination of egg-
shells. The absence of Salmonella spp. in the commercial
laying hen eggs analyzed in the present study, alert to the
type of the eggs that really represents risk to the public
health. The isolation of Salmonella in 52% of the discarded
hatching eggs analyzed, the prevalence of the serovar
Enteritidis and the identification of SE PT9, which has been
implicated in human outbreaks of salmonellosis, suggest
that discarded hatching eggs are an important vehicle of
Salmonella spp. transmission when destined for human
consumption.
