Diarrheogenic Escherichia coli (DEC) strains are an important cause of intestinal syndromes in the developing
world mainly affecting children. DEC strains often infect tourists from developed countries traveling to
Mexico, causing so-called “traveler diarrhea”. DEC strains are typically transmitted by contaminated food
and water; however, the prevalence of these strains in food items that are produced, consumed and some-
times exported in northwestern Mexico has not been evaluated. In this study, we conducted a large microbi-
ological survey of DEC strains in 5162 food items and beverages consumed throughout Sinaloa state during
2008 and 2009. We developed a panel of eight sequential PCR reactions that detected the presence of
all DEC categories, including typical or atypical variants. Thermotolerant coliforms (also known as fecal
coliforms) and E. coli were detected by conventional bacteriology in 13.4% (692/5162) and 7.92% (409/5162)
of food items, respectively. Among 409 E. coli isolates, 13.6% (56/409) belonged to DEC strains. Dairy products
(2.8%) were the most contaminated with DEC, while DEC strains were not detected in beverages and ice
samples. The pathogenic type that was most commonly isolated was EPEC (78.5%), followed by EAEC (10.7%),
STEC (8.9%) and ETEC (1.7%). EHEC, DAEC and EIEC strains were not detected. Approximately 80% of EPEC and
EAEC strains were classiﬁed as atypical variants; they did not adhere to a culture of HEp-2 cell. Of the isolated
DEC strains, 66% showed resistance to at least one commonly prescribed antibiotic. In conclusion, the presence
of DEC strains in food items and beverages available in northwestern Mexico is low and may not represent a
threat for the general population or those traveling to tourist areas.

1. Introduction

Diarrheogenic Escherichia coli (DEC) strains can cause mild to se-
vere diarrhea and other symptoms in humans. These strains consti-
tute a heterogeneous group of organisms with different virulence
properties, epidemiology, and disease associations (Kaper et al.,
2004). DEC strains are among the most common etiologic agents of
diarrhea. Based on their speciﬁc virulence factors and phenotypic
traits, DEC strains are divided into six pathogenic types: enteropatho-
genic E. coli (EPEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), enterotoxigenic
E. coli (ETEC), diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC), enteroinvasive E. coli
(EIEC) and Vero toxin-producing/Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (VTEC/
STEC), which includes the well-known subgroup enterohaemorrhagic
E. coli (EHEC) (Kaper et al., 2004).

The identiﬁcation of DEC strains involves the detection of encoded
genes and phenotypic characteristics (e.g. production of toxins and
adhesion patterns on epithelial cells). Thus, typical EPEC strains con-
tain eae and bfpA, which are genes encoding the proteins intimin
and bundle-forming pilus (BFP) that are implicated in the localized
adherence phenotype (LA) on cell cultures. EAEC is commonly associ-
ated with traveler's diarrhea in developing countries. EAEC strains are
distinguished by their typical adherence to cultured cells, i.e., an
aggregative adherence pattern due to a variety of virulence factors
(ﬁmbriae gene, aaf; promoter of colonization, dispersin; and plasmid,
pCVD432) regulated by the aggregative factor (AggR). ETEC strains
are deﬁned by the presence of one or two plasmid-encoded entero-
toxins, the thermostable toxin (encoded by st) and the thermolabile
toxin (encoded by lt). ETEC strains are the most common cause of
childhood diarrhea among all E. coli pathotypes and the most fre-
quent cause of diarrhea in travelers to developing countries. DAEC is
deﬁned by a diffuse pattern of adherence in HEp-2 cell culture assays.
A ﬁmbrial adhesin known as F1845 (encoded by daaE) mediates
the adherence of DAEC to epithelial cells. EIEC shows pathogenic,

phenotypic and genetic similarities with Shigella strains. EIEC can be
identiﬁed among other criteria, by their epithelial cell invasiveness
(mediated in part by the ipaH and virF genes) and association with
dysentery. EHEC is associated with bloody diarrhea and hemolytic
uremic syndrome. EHEC contains the locus of the enterocyte efface-
ment pathogenicity island, which is also present in EPEC, and ex-
presses one or two shiga-like toxin-encoding genes (stx1 and stx2).
The most common serotype associated with outbreaks in the United
States and Europe is the serotype O157:H7 (Kaper et al., 2004).

DEC strains include several emerging pathogens of worldwide
public health importance, since they have been associated with out-
breaks and travelers' diarrhea around the world in recent years
(Bradley et al., 2012; Dallman et al., 2012; Frank et al., 2011; Guiral
et al., 2011),
including in Mexico (Cortes-Ortiz et al., 2002;
Ouyang-Latimer et al., 2010). This explosive epidemic behavior is
in part due to an increase in international travel and trade globaliza-
tion (WHO). Thus, individuals traveling to countries where some
DEC-associated diseases are prevalent have an increased risk of not
only acquiring these diseases but also transmitting these DEC strains
upon their return to their home country. Furthermore, in recent
years, there has been a discussion about the potential for strains in
developing countries that are resistant to antibiotics to be spread to
more industrialized ones (Guiral et al., 2011). This highlights the
need for microbiological surveillance of food and beverages, such
as the one conducted in this study, of antibiotic resistant strains
that can be potentially circulating in places with uncontrolled pre-
scription of antibiotics and visited by tourists and entrepreneurs
from developed countries.

Today, food safety is an increasingly important public health issue.
Governments all over the world are intensifying their efforts to im-
prove food safety mainly because there has been an increase in
food-related diseases and outbreaks, which have raised consumer
concerns and public health awareness (Langiano et al., 2012; Taylor
et al., 2012). Finding the source of contamination has also become
imperative, as this information would help to stop further spread of
disease outbreaks. For example, several outbreaks of deadly E. coli
O157:H7 infections have occurred recently, and the investigated
source has been identiﬁed as contaminated food products as diverse
as vegetables, cookie dough or raw milk (CDC, 2006; Frank et al.,
2011; Gaulin et al., 2012; McCollum et al., 2012; Neil et al., 2012;
Xiong et al., 2012).

Outbreaks caused by DEC strains have been closely linked to con-
sumption of contaminated food and water. In developed countries,
outbreaks caused by EHEC have been associated with hamburgers
(O'Brien et al., 1993) sausages, unpasteurized milk, lettuce (Ackers
et al., 1998; Hilborn et al., 1999), radish sprouts and spinach (CDC,
2006; Michino et al., 1999). EPEC, EIEC and ETEC have been isolated
mainly from sources of water and other foods (Bengtsson et al., 1966;
Black, 1990; Lanyi et al., 1959; Nakajima et al., 2005; Valentini et al.,
1992), whereas sources of infection of DAEC strains are still unknown.
Active surveillance of drinking water and food sources is impera-
tive as new DEC strains have emerged in recent years. An outbreak
reported in May 2011 in Germany was due to a new serotype of
EHEC, O104:H4. This new strain caused more than 3816 disease
cases, with 845 cases of severe hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)
leading to 54 deaths within three months (Frank et al., 2011). After
a thorough investigation of possible sources of infection, it was
determined that this strain originated in contaminated sprouts. The
outbreak extended to 15 countries, including Denmark, France, Greece,
the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Norway, Austria, Spain, the Czech
Republic, Luxembourg, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, Canada, and the
United States (WHO).

In Mexico, only few studies have examined the presence of
DEC strains in speciﬁc food items and persons. For example ETEC,
EPEC, EAEC, STEC and EIEC have been identiﬁed in some food items
(salads, taco dressings, chili sauces, chili peppers, acid-fermented

foods and desserts) (Adachi et al., 2002; Castro-Rosas et al., 2012;
Cerna-Cortes et al., 2012; Estrada-Garcia et al., 2002; Lopez-Saucedo
et al., 2010; Sainz et al., 2001; Vigil et al., 2009) and particularly in
children (Cortes-Ortiz et al., 2002; Cravioto et al., 1985; Estrada-
Garcia et al., 2005a; Lopez-Saucedo et al., 2010) and US visitors
(Paredes-Paredes et al., 2011) who developed diarrhea. During the
last few years, Sinaloa, a state located in northwestern Mexico,
has had an increase in cases of gastrointestinal diseases where
the etiologic agent has not been identiﬁed. This may be mainly due
to a lack of epidemiological data about reemerging pathogens
(Velazquez-Roman et al., 2012), such as DEC strains. Furthermore, ac-
tive surveillance of emerging and reemerging pathogens is necessary,
as Mazatlan and Culiacan, both located in Sinaloa, are world-class
tourist destinations. Sinaloa is also a source of food exports to the
US and other countries.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the presence and
prevalence of DEC strains in beverages and food items (N = 5,162)
meant for human consumption in the state of Sinaloa, for example,
dairy and meat products, seafood and ﬁsh, beverages and prepared
foods. These strains were identiﬁed phenotypically by using a newly
developed panel of PCR reactions. The adhesion potential of these
strains to human epithelial HEp-2 cells as well as their antibiotic
resistance proﬁle was investigated. Although the prevalence of these
strains was low in the studied items, antibiotic resistance of the isolated
strains was high. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of the preva-
lence of DEC strains isolated from diverse food items and beverages in
Mexico.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Bacterial Strains

DEC reference strains utilized in this study belong to our labora-
tory collection and included EPEC E2348/69 (eae+ and bfpA+)
(Flores-Villasenor et al., 2012a), ETEC (lt+ and st−), EIEC (ipaH+
and virF−), EHEC O157:H7 EDL933 (eae+, hlyA+, stx1+ and
stx2+) (Flores-Villasenor et al., 2012b), DAEC (daaE+), EAEC O42
(aggR+, aap+, pCVD432+ and aafII+) and E. coli DH5α (Invitrogen).
Bacteria were routinely grown overnight in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth
(0.5% yeast extract, 1% tryptone and 0.5% NaCl) and incubated at 37 °C
in a shaker incubator (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Waltham, Massachusetts
USA).

2.2. Sample Collection

Food samples were collected from 10 different municipalities in
the Sinaloa State located in northwestern Mexico between January
2008 and December 2009. A total of 5162 samples were collected
from food service establishment and retail food samples. The sampling
sites included, but were not limited to bakeries, bars, bed-and-
breakfast operations, coffee shops, convenience stores, fairs, food
banks, grocery stores, meal services for home-bound persons, mobile
food carts, restaurants, vending machine operators and street food
vendors. The food items that were analyzed consisted of prepared
foods (n = 1594), including broths and soups, beef, pork, goat, lamb
meat, poultry, fruits, salads, hamburgers, sandwiches, eggs, sausages,
ham, rice, sauces, beans, chilaquiles, desserts, mayonnaise, hard
pork sausages and tortillas. Beverages and ice (n = 1597) samples in-
cluded, drinking water fountains, tap water, tea, fruit-ﬂavored water
and ice. Dairy products (n = 669) consisted of cream, buttermilk,
milk, butter, cheese and yogurt. Fish and seafood (n = 656) samples
included raw products, seasoned shrimp, clams, squid, mixed seafood,
shrimp, stingrays, oysters, octopus and ﬁsh. Meat and meat products
(n = 646) included mammalian meat and poultry, sausages, ham
and hard pork sausage (Table 2). Approximately 15 g or 15 ml of a
sample was placed in a sterile plastic bag and laid directly into a

38

wide-mouth thermos containing wet ice. Samples collected during the
day were processed within 4 h, whereas those collected during the
evening were refrigerated at 4 °C until processing the next morning.

2.3. Bacteriological Analyses

Samples were ﬁrst processed for two indicator bacteria: fecal coli-
form and E. coli, as described in the Mexican Ofﬁcial Standard and
Bacteriological Analytical Manual of the Food and Drug Administra-
tion Chapter 4 (BAM, 2002). Positive tubes from the EC broth assay
were streaked on MacConkey agar, and presumptive E. coli were
transferred to eosin-methylene blue (EMB) agar and violet red bile
agar. The colonies were further phenotypically (biochemical, API 20E;
bioMerieux) and genotypically identiﬁed (PCR, described below).

2.4. Preparation of Template DNA

Five colonies of E. coli per sample were grown in 3 mL of LB broth
for 18 h to reach stationary phase. The cells were pelleted by centrifu-
gation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min and then resuspended in 0.3 ml of dis-
tilled water. Pellets were heated at 100 °C for 10 min, vortexed for
10 s, and centrifuged again at 12,000 ×g for 3 min. DNA-containing
supernatants were transferred to 0.5 mL microfuge tubes and stored
at −20 °C until use.

2.5. Sequential Multiplex PCR, Protocol to Identify DEC Strains

PCR reactions to conﬁrm E. coli (Supplementary data, Fig. S1) at
the species level were carried out according to the protocol described
by Tsen et al. (1998). To further identify DEC strains within our E. coli
isolates, a protocol of sequential multiplex, duplex and single PCR
reactions was designed and validated using reference strains. These
reactions ampliﬁed a set of genes encoded by each individual DEC
category. Our protocol of sequential reactions was based on previous

reports from Mexico and other Latino American countries (Araujo et al.,
2007; Cortes-Ortiz et al., 2002; Cravioto et al., 1985; Estrada-Garcia
et al., 2005b; Lopez-Saucedo et al., 2010). These sequential multiplex
PCR reactions identiﬁed the most prevalent DEC groups in decreasing
order. The ﬁrst reaction identiﬁed EPEC strains. Negative samples
were advanced to reaction #2 to identify EAEC strains, and so on
(Table 1 and Fig. 1).

Multiplex PCR reaction #1 contained primers to amplify the
intimin gene (eae) and the structural subunit of the bundle-forming
pilus (Bfp) gene (bfpA). Reaction #1 detected both typical (eae+
and bfpA+) and atypical (eae+ and bfpA-) EPEC strains. Multiplex
PCR reaction #2 contained primers that detected a gene encoding a
regulator protein (aggR) and a ﬁmbriae gene (aafII), and multiplex
PCR reaction #3 contained primers to amplify the gene encoding
the protein dispersin (aap) and the aggregative adherence pattern as-
sociated plasmid (pCVD432) to identify typical (aggR+ and pCVD432+
and/or aafII+ aap+) and atypical (aggR- and pCVD432+ and/or aafII+
aap+) EAEC strains. Duplex PCR reaction #4 ampliﬁed both the gene
encoding the heat labile toxin (Lt) and that encoding the heat stable
toxin (stII) present in ETEC strains. PCR reaction #5 contained primers
that ampliﬁed the structural subunit gene of the F1845 ﬁmbria (daaE)
to detect DAEC strains. Detection of EIEC strains was performed with
reaction #6; this reaction contained primers to amplify the invasion
genes virF and ipaH. Negative strains and DEC eae+ strains (from
reaction #1) were screened in multiplex PCR reaction #7 to detect
possible EHEC strains. This reaction ampliﬁed genes stx1 and/or
stx2; EHEC strains encode both Shiga toxin genes and the eae gene,
whereas STEC strains were eae-. Finally, multiplex PCR reaction #8
contained primers that ampliﬁed the hemolysin gene (hlyA), the
rfbE gene coding for the production of the lipopolysaccharide O of
E. coli O157 and the ﬂiC gene that encodes the E. coli ﬂagellum H7
serotype. Reaction #8 detected EHEC O157:H7 strains (Fig. 1). Primer
sequences, PCR conditions and product sizes are shown in Table 1 and
the supporting material (Supplementary data, Fig. S2).

PCR ampliﬁcation was performed in a 25 μL volume consisting of
1x GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega), forward and reverse primers
1 μmol and 2 μl of DNA template, with the remaining volume
consisting of molecular biology grade water. PCR reactions were car-
ried out in a Thermal Cycler C1000 (BIO-RAD Laboratories, Hercules,
California). PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in a 2%
agarose gel. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/mL)
and photographed using a digital imaging system (Kodak, Model E1
logia 100 imaging system).

2.6. Adherence Assay on HEp-2 cells

The adhesion assay on HEp-2 cells was performed essentially as
described by Cravioto et al. (1979). Brieﬂy, HEp-2 cells grown in
Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM, GIBCO-BRL, Gaithers-burg,
MD), with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics were seeded onto
coverslips that had been placed in the wells of 24-well plates (Costar,
Cambridge, MA) and incubated until reaching 70–80% conﬂuence
(2–3 days). Washed HEp-2 cells were fed with 1 ml of fresh MEM
medium without fetal bovine serum or antibiotics, but with 0.5%
(wt/vol) of D-mannose before being inoculated.

One day before the experiment, E. coli strains were grown over-
night in 5 ml of peptone water with 3% D-mannose. Cultures were
then centrifuged, washed twice with sterile PBS and resuspended in
MEM with no additives. One hundred microliters of the bacterial sus-
pension (~1.5 × 108 CFU) was inoculated onto HEp-2 cell cultures.
Infected cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmo-
sphere and then washed three times with sterile PBS, ﬁxed with
70% methanol, and stained with Giemsa. Adherence patterns were
assigned according to the description of Scaletsky et al. (1984)
and Nataro et al. (1987) (Nataro et al., 1987; Scaletsky et al., 1984).
The EPEC reference strain (E2349/68) showing localized adherence
(LA), EAEC 042 showing aggregative adherence and E. coli K12 that
does not attach to HEP-2 cells were included as controls in every
experiment.

2.7. Serotyping O157:H7

Serotypes of strains positive for at least one EHEC/STEC virulence
factor (stx1, stx2 or HlyA) were investigated using rabbit antisera
obtained from the National Institute of Epidemiological Reference
(InDRE), Mexico, and prepared against the 157 somatic (O) and the
7 ﬂagellar (H) antigens. The microagglutination test was used to
determine the serogroup O157:H7 (Orskov et al., 1984).

2.8. Antimicrobial Agent Susceptibility Testing

The Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion method was used to determine
sensitivity or resistance to antimicrobial agents, according to guide-
lines developed by the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI,
2011). Recommendations of the National Antimicrobial Resistance
Monitoring System for E. coli were utilized to deﬁne breakpoints of an-
tibiotics and thus categorize the isolates as resistant, intermediate or
sensitive (Supplementary data, Table S2). These antibiotics were cho-
sen because of their importance in treating human (Amabile-Cuevas,
2010) or animal E. coli infections and their use as feed additives to
promote growth in animals. They represent different classes of antimi-
crobial agents that are available to treat gram-negative infection in
Mexico. The protocol was performed as follows: fresh cultures were
inoculated into LB broth and incubated until they reached a turbidity
of 0.5 using the McFarland standard. Mueller–Hinton agar plates
were swabbed with these cultures, and antibiotic disks (BD BBL,
Franklin Lakes, NJ) were placed onto inoculated plates in a sterile
environment. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 18 to 20 h. The
diameters (in millimeters) of clear zones of growth inhibition around
the antimicrobial agent disks were measured using a precision digital

caliper (Absolute, Mitutoyo, Japan). E. coli ATCC 25922 (American
Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was used as negative control,
this strain bear no resistance to the selected antibiotics. E. coli strain
ATCC 35218 was used as positive control for β-lactam/β-lactamase
inhibitor combinations.

3. Results

3.1. Detection of E. coli in Food Items Consumed in Northwestern Mexico

Since water- and food-borne DEC strains, such as EPEC and ETEC,
have been isolated from food items produced in different regions of
Mexico (Adachi et al., 2002; Castro-Rosas et al., 2012; Cerna-Cortes
et al., 2012; Estrada-Garcia et al., 2002; Lopez-Saucedo et al., 2010;
Sainz et al., 2001; Vigil et al., 2009) and shiga-toxin-producing EHEC
has recently been implicated in an outbreak that infected more than
3000 people and killed ~50 in Europe (Frank et al., 2011), we performed
an epidemiological surveillance of the most common food items and
sources of water (N = 5162) consumed in northwestern Mexico to
evaluate the presence of DEC strains, including EHEC strains.

The geographical area covered by our sampling is home to approx-
imately 87% of Sinaloa's state population. A total of 5162 samples,
including dairy products, meat products, seafood and ﬁsh, prepared
foods, beverages and ice, were analyzed (Table 2). Our ﬁrst screening
for fecal contamination detected coliform bacteria above permissive
levels for human consumption in 696 samples (13.4%), whereas
E. coli was isolated in 409 food items (7.92%) (Table 2). Further mo-
lecular analyses by PCR targeting the 16SrRNA gene conﬁrmed the
identity of these isolates (Supplementary data, Fig. S1). Our study
found that dairy products were the food items that were most
frequently contaminated with E. coli (21.3%), followed by meat
products (17%) (Table 2). The presence of coliform bacteria and
E. coli in beverage samples and ice was very low, 3.38% and 0.93%,
respectively (Table 2).

3.2. Prevalence of DEC Strains in Food Items

To identify the DEC group of our E. coli isolates, a protocol of eight
sequential (multiplex, duplex, and single) PCR reactions was developed
in this study (Fig. 1 and Table 1). These reactions ampliﬁed a set of genes
encoded by each individual DEC category (see Material and Methods).
The optimization of duplex PCR was performed with DNA extracted
from reference DEC strains (e.g. EHEC, EPEC, EAEC, EIEC, STEC and
DAEC). We conﬁrmed that our PCR identiﬁed only the targeted
pathogenic group (Supplementary data, Fig. S2). Our multiplex PCR
studies revealed that 56 food products (13.69%) contained DEC strains
(Table 2). The food items that were most often contaminated with
DEC were dairy products, 19 samples [33.92% (19/56)], while beverages
and ice samples were not contaminated with DEC (Table 2).

In regard to individual DEC categories, our protocol of multiplex
PCR reactions found, as expected, that EPEC was the most common
(78.57%) DEC isolated (Table 2). The prevalence of EPEC strains was
similar among the different food items, ranging from 68% through to

84% (Table 2). EAEC was isolated in only 10% of DEC-positive food
samples, while STEC strains were found in 8.92% of DEC isolates
(Table 2). Our PCR studies also revealed the presence of ETEC in a
dairy product, representing the 1.78% of all DEC. ETEC strains isolated
from Mexico have been associated with traveler's diarrhea, infecting
mainly American tourists (Paredes-Paredes et al., 2011). These results
indicate that the food items and beverages that are available in Sinaloa
may not be a threat for those traveling to tourist areas of Sinaloa, such
as Mazatlan. Moreover, no EHEC strains or DAEC strains could be
isolated from any of the 5162 food items that were evaluated.

3.3. Presence of Typical and Atypical DEC

An emerging epidemiological trait of DEC isolates is the appearance
of atypical variants that have lost virulence genes but have increasingly
been implicated in cases of human diarrhea. Thus, our multiplex PCR re-
actions 1, 2 and 3 included primers that differentiated between typical
and atypical variants of EPEC or EAEC. Supplementary data, Table S1
shows that most of the EPEC isolates belonged to atypical strains
(n = 35) containing only the gene for the intimin (eae) but not for
bfpA. The remainder of the EPEC strains (n = 9) contained both eae
and bfpA and therefore were considered typical strains (Supplementary
data, Table S1). Only two typical EAEC strains (containing the aggR
gene) were identiﬁed, while four atypical EAEC isolates were identiﬁed.
As reported elsewhere (Weintraub, 2007), all typical or atypical EAEC
strains contained the aggregative adherence pattern-associated plas-
mid (pCVD432) (Supplementary data, Table S1).

3.4. Adherence Patterns of DEC Isolated from Food Items

Adhesion properties of EPEC and EAEC to in vitro-cultured HEp-2
epithelial cells have been associated with the virulence of these
strains (Vidal et al., 2007; Weintraub, 2007). Thus, typical EPEC can
attach to cell cultures in a pattern called localized adherence (LA) be-
cause the bacteria form a microcolony-like structure on the cell sur-
face (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2D and Supplementary data, Table
S1, all typical EPEC isolates showed the LA phenotype. Moreover,
only one atypical EPEC showed the LA phenotype, whereas all others
(n = 34) did not attach to HEp-2 cells (Supplementary data, Table
S1). The typical EAEC, containing the aggregative adherence ﬁmbriae
aggR gene, forms a stacked-brick adherence pattern, also called aggre-
gative adherence (AggA), when incubated for 3 h with HEp-2 cells
(Fig. 2B). Our studies found that all typical EAEC that were isolated
from the food samples showed the AggA phenotype, whereas the
atypical EAEC did not attach to cultured HEp-2 cells (Fig. 2E). All
other DEC strains (i.e., STEC and ETEC) that were isolated from the
food items did not adhere to HEp-2 cells within the 3 h incubation
period (Fig. 2E and Supplementary data, Table S1).

3.5. Antibiotic Resistance Proﬁles of DEC Strains

The antibiotic resistance of all DEC isolates (N = 56) was investi-
gated. We found that 66% of DEC strains were resistant to at least one

strains were resistant to two or more drugs. Resistance to tetracycline
(34%), cefotaxime (30%) and ampicillin (29%) was common (Table 3).
Almost 60% of EPEC strains were resistant to at least one antibiotic;
they were frequently resistant to cefotaxime (34%) and tetracycline
(23%). Of great interest, all EAEC strains were resistant to ampicillin,

Note: One E. coli strain was identify as ETEC with the following antibiotic resistance pattern
(Ampicillin = Sensible; Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim = Sensible; Chloranphenicol =
Sensible; Gentamicin = Sensible; Tetracyclin = Resistant; Cefotaxime = Resistant;
Ceftazidime = Sensible; Ciproﬂoxacin = Sensible and Nalidixic acid = Sensible). Strains
with Resistance to 6, 7, 8 and 9 drugs were not detected.

and 83.3% were resistant to two or more antibiotics, On the other
hand, STEC strains were commonly resistant to tetracycline (60%)
and gentamicin (40%) (Table 3). Very low resistance (EPEC strains)
or sensitivity (EAEC and STEC strains) was observed for ciproﬂoxacin,
nalidixic acid and ceftazidime.

The percentage of resistant bacteria was different for the two
years of the study. For DEC strains isolated in 2008 (n = 10), 70%
were found to be resistant to tetracycline, 50% to ampicillin, 30%
to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, 20% to gentamicin and 10% to
cefotaxime. In 2009, the percentage of DEC strains resistant to tetra-
cycline, ampicillin and sulfamethoxazole–trimethropin decreased to
26%, 24% and 11%, respectively. The percentage of strains resistant
to gentamicin in 2009 showed a signiﬁcant increase from 20% to
35% (Table 3).

4. Discussion

Virtually nothing was known about the presence of DEC strains in
food products or water consumed at northwestern Mexico, until this
study demonstrated a very low prevalence (1%). Infectious diseases
transmitted by foods have become a major public health concern in
recent years (Frank et al., 2011; Langiano et al., 2012; Taylor et al.,
2012). It is imperative to evaluate the quality of food and water
sources, especially in places where tourists and non-residents can
be exposed. Sinaloa is a strategic region where food products are
produced and exported to the US and other countries. Moreover,
the port of Mazatlan receives more than one million tourists every
year. Our study demonstrated that 1% of the 5162 food samples
collected during 2008 and 2009 were contaminated with DEC strains.
We also investigated the antibiotic resistance proﬁles and found
that these strains were sensitive to ceftazidime or showed low resis-
tance to nalidixic acid or ciproﬂoxacin. To our knowledge, this is the
ﬁrst report of DEC isolation from several food items in Mexico.

To evaluate the presence of DEC strains, we have developed a pro-
tocol of sequential multiplex, duplex and single PCR reactions. To our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst protocol with sequential reactions aimed
at identifying all known DEC strains and their variants. Identifying
these strains and their variants was particularly important, as our
study included an analysis of 409 E. coli strains. As demonstrated,
our scheme ﬁrst identiﬁed EPEC strains in 10.7% (n = 44) of E. coli
isolates, and we then reducing the number of strains (n = 365) to

42

be classiﬁed by subsequent reactions. An earlier published set of
reactions targeted only EPEC, EIEC, EHEC and ETEC strains, but not
EAEC or EPEC and EAEC typical and atypical variants (Rappelli et al.,
2001). There is also an available multiplex PCR protocol of two reac-
tions, but the limited number of targets within these two reactions
fails to identify typical and atypical variants of EPEC and EAEC or
epidemic strains of EHEC O157:H7 (Fujioka et al., 2009). On the
other hand, our approach to detecting DEC's screened 5 individual
E. coli colonies per sample; this approach increased the likelihood of
detecting positive i.e. DEC strains or negative, i.e. normal ﬂora E. coli.
The low prevalence of DEC strains (1.08%) demonstrated in our
studies is similar to that reported in a recent study that analyzed
more than 3000 samples of beef, poultry, and pork in Korea, and
detected ~1.3% prevalence of DEC strains (Lee et al., 2009).

E. coli and DEC strains were identiﬁed in all food groups analyzed;
therefore, there was no association with a particular food product or
water sample. Nevertheless, dairy products were the samples that
were most frequently contaminated by DEC bacteria, followed by
meat derivatives and seafood and ﬁsh. It is therefore reasonable
to speculate that the source of contamination could be the result
of human fecal contamination of those products. For example, the
cheese industry in Sinaloa is “artisanal”, so producers regularly
manipulate their products with their bare hands, or maybe the
same pair of gloves, from the beginning of the production process
until the ﬁnal product is shipped. Accordingly, 13.4% of samples
were contaminated with coliform bacteria at levels not permissive
for human consumption. Although less likely, DEC strains from the
normal ﬂora of animals (i.e., cattle) can be a source of contamination
(Nataro and Kaper, 1998; Stella et al., 2012).

The most prevalent DEC strain was EPEC, followed by EAEC and
STEC, and only one ETEC strain was isolated. This higher prevalence
of EPEC may suggest that 1) local people may carry EPEC with no ap-
parent signs of disease or that 2) EPEC strains are a possible cause of
diarrheal disease in Sinaloa. The presence of EPEC in diarrheal cases in
Sinaloa has been suggested (Canizalez-Roman et al., in preparation).
EPEC strains are commonly isolated from children with diarrhea
in Mexico (Paniagua et al., 2007) and other developing countries
including India, Peru and Brazil (Ghosh and Ali, 2010; Nunes Mdo
et al., 2012; Ochoa et al., 2009a).

The EPEC pathotype was classiﬁed as typical if the strain possessed
the E. coli adherence plasmid (EAF) and the bfpA gene encoding the
structural subunit of BFP. E. coli strains that do not possess the EAF
plasmid or bfpA gene are classiﬁed as atypical EPEC (Trabulsi et al.,
2002). Our genotypic and phenotypic characterization demonstrated
that 35 strains (80%) were atypical variants of EPEC, whereas the
remaining 9 strains (20%), were typical. Until the 1990s, typical
EPEC strains were more commonly isolated than atypical EPEC
strains, though recent studies have indicated that the prevalence of
typical EPEC strains has decreased and that they are gradually being
replaced by atypical EPEC (Trabulsi et al., 2002). This bacterial burden
in Sinaloa's food samples may be related to the potential of atypical
EPEC strains to cause human disease. For example, a recent paper by
Estrada-Garcia et al. (2009) reported that the prevalence of atypical
and typical EPEC strains isolated from cases of diarrhea in children
from Mexico was 44.5% and 10%, respectively (Estrada-Garcia et al.,
2009). Similarly, studies in Peru (Contreras et al., 2010), Brazil (Nunes
Mdo et al., 2012), Japan (Yatsuyanagi et al., 2003) and Australia
(Nguyen et al., 2006) have reported an increase in diarrheal cases
due to atypical EPEC, suggesting that atypical EPEC is an emerging
diarrheagenic pathogen, not only in developing countries, but also in
industrialized countries.

The second most prevalent DEC strain that was detected was EAEC;
EAEC strains were also further classiﬁed as typical and atypical. The
term typical or atypical EAEC refers to strains harboring or lacking
the gene encoding the transcriptional regulator AggR, respectively.
Some studies have demonstrated an association of typical EAEC with

diarrhea (Estrada-Garcia et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2006). While the
pathogenicity of atypical EAEC has not been fully elucidated, these
strains have been associated with food-borne outbreaks (Cobeljic et
al., 1996) and clearly have been associated with a massive outbreak
of gastrointestinal illness in school children from Japan (Itoh et al.,
1997), Brazil (Regua-Mangia et al., 2009), and other developing coun-
tries (Bangar and Mamatha, 2008; Scavia et al., 2008).

Another important DEC that was evaluated in this work was
enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), also known as Shiga-toxin producing
E. coli (STEC). EHEC is a group of well-recognized pathogens that are
responsible for serious human infections such as hemorrhagic colitis
and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (Law, 2000; Nataro and Kaper,
1998). Production of Shiga toxins (encoded by the stx1 and stx2
genes) is a key feature of most STEC. Other virulence-associated factors
include the pO157 plasmid, which encodes hemolysin (hlyA) among
other genes (Schmidt et al., 1994). Although outbreaks of O157 STEC
have been associated with the consumption of raw vegetables
(Watanabe et al., 1999),
little is known about the presence of
non-O157 STEC (Balague et al., 2006) in food items worldwide. Our
ﬁndings showed that STEC (serotype O157 negative) was the third
most common DEC identiﬁed in our study (5/56). Similarly, in another
study in Mexico, STEC (serotype O157 negative) was the most prevalent
pathotype found in street-vended taco dressings (coriander, onion and
red chili sauce) (Lopez-Saucedo et al., 2010). In this study, we detected
STEC mainly in vegetables salad, fresh cheese and Strawberry pie,
suggesting that these food items could be a potential vehicle of trans-
mission for STEC strains in Mexico.

The potential of STEC strains to cause diarrhea in Mexico has been
previously studied by Rosas et al. (2006) and Cortes-Ortiz et al.
(2002), who reported the presence of STEC (22% and 0.08% respec-
tively. The ﬁrst study was conducted in environmental samples and
the second reported an outbreak of diarrhea associated with the
overﬂow of sewage water in “Valle the Chalco”, Mexico (Cortes-Ortiz
et al., 2002).

Another important strain is EHEC serotype O157:H7. This serotype
is the most frequent EHEC that is implicated in food-borne outbreaks
worldwide (Mead and Grifﬁn, 1998). Our studies did not detect O157:
H7 in our food and water samples. To the best of our knowledge,
the presence of E. coli O157:H7 in food samples has not been previ-
ously reported in Mexico. This strain, however, has been isolated
from beef carcasses at a slaughter plant in Mexico [2.7% (7/258)]
(Varela-Hernandez et al., 2007). Moreover, between 2009 and 2010
six cases of disease produced by E. coli O157:H7, reported by the
Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), affected Canadian travellers
whom had recently been in Mexico; the implicated food was not
detected (PHAC, 2009, 2010). The presence of STEC (stx1) strains in
our samples, the geographical proximity of Sinaloa to the U.S. border,
and outbreaks reported by the FDA in 2006 in California warrant per-
manent epidemic surveillance for STEC and EHEC strains in food and
water items, as well as in cases of DEC-associated food-related disease.
ETEC was only isolated from one food item (milk-derivative
product). ETEC strains are associated with two major clinical syn-
dromes: weanling diarrhea among children in the developing
world, and traveler's diarrhea. Traveler's diarrhea is usually contracted
from contaminated food and water (Black, 1990; Mattila, 1994). Several
studies have shown the importance of ETEC in infections among
the tourists visiting Asia, Africa and South America (Adachi et al.,
2001; Daniels, 2006; Daniels et al., 2000), and as a cause of diarrhea
among Mexican adults and US travelers in Mexico (Bouckenooghe
et al., 2002). Therefore, our results suggest that food and drinking
water that are available in Sinaloa may not be a risk for ETEC-
associated traveler’s diarrhea for tourists visiting Sinaloa and the
world-class tourist areas of Mazatlan.

While the prevalence of DEC strains was low, they can still either
cause isolated cases of DEC-related diseases or produce outbreaks
in child care centers, schools or resorts. Our studies have identiﬁed

antibiotic therapies that can be utilized in such an outbreak. Out of a
panel of antibiotics, we observed very low resistance (EPEC strains)
or sensitivity (EAEC and STEC strains) to ciproﬂoxacin, nalidixic acid
and ceftazidime. On the other hand, an alarming 66% of DEC isolates
were resistant to antibiotics. This high resistance rate is clearly the
result of the uncontrolled self-prescription of antibiotics that has
occurred in Mexico for several decades. Fortunately, a new law has
been approved by the Health Secretary that ﬁnally regulate the sale
of antibiotics and other controlled drugs in Mexican drugstores and
pharmacies.

Strains of EAEC showed resistance to more antibiotics than the
other DEC strains. In our population, EAEC strains might be more ex-
posed to antimicrobials, as these strains can cause persistent diarrhea
and are often carried asymptomatically, thus increasing the chances
of exposure to multiple antibiotics. In support of our argument,
Estrada-Garcia et al. (2005a, 2005b) found, in a study of Mexican chil-
dren, that among all of the DEC categories, EAEC was signiﬁcantly
more resistant to ampicillin and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole
(Estrada-Garcia et al., 2005b). In a recently published study carried
out in Peru, the prevalence of resistance to ampicillin, clotrimoxazole,
tetracycline and nalidixic acid was signiﬁcantly higher in EAEC than
in EPEC and ETEC (Ochoa et al., 2009b).

In conclusion, our work represents the ﬁrst comprehensive study
that evaluated the distribution, prevalence, and detection of virulence
factors in DEC strains in more than 5000 samples of food and drinking
water utilized for human consumption in Mexico. To the best of our
knowledge, there has not been any outbreak of food borne DEC in
Sinaloa for at least the last ten years. The protocol for evaluating
DEC strains in food and water samples, as well as in E. coli strains
isolated from cases of diarrhea, that was designed and validated in
this study, is currently in use by our laboratory to monitor for the
presence of these strains.
