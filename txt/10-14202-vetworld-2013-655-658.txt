A bstract

A im :The objective of this study was to determine the antibiotic resistance pattern of Shiga-toxin producing Escherichiacoli
(STEC) in bovines and their handlers.
M aterialsand M ethods: Of the total of 126 E.coliisolates screened by multiplex PCR for the presence of Shiga-toxin genes,
15 STEC isolates were obtained comprising of 9 isolates from cattle, 3 from buffaloes, and 3 from bovine handlers, which
were tested for their antibiotic sensitivity/ resistance pattern to various antibiotics.
R esults:Twelve of the 15 STEC isolates (80%) showed resistance to three or more antibiotics. Chloramphenicol was the most
effective with 86.6% sensitivity, followed by Norfloxacin (80%), Ciprofloxacin (73.3%), and Co-trimoxazole (73.3%).
Whereas 66.6% of the STEC isolates were resistant toAmikacin andAmpicillin, the other 60% were resistant toAmoxycillin,
Cefixime, and Kanamycin.
C onclusion:Multiple drug resistance patterns among the STEC in the present study, especially high resistance to the
frequently used antibiotics in both bovines and their handlers, implies that antibiotic resistance is often acquired due to their
indiscriminate use; thereby, creating a need for rational and judicious use of antibiotics in the field.

In trodu ction

Antimicrobials have served variety of purposes,
including treatment of infections, prophylaxis, and
growth promotion. However, their widespread use in
both animals and humans has led to several undesirable
consequences; the most important among these is the
antibiotic resistance in bacteria [1]. The indiscriminate
and uncontrolled use of antimicrobial agents in animals
exerts a selection pressure and encourages
the
proliferation of drug resistant strains of food borne
pathogens in animal populations which may be
transmitted to humans from the environment or
through food [2]. Due to poor environmental sanitation
and low personal hygiene, the situation could endanger
public health. Since the last decade Shiga toxin
producing E.coli(STEC) strains have emerged as
important food-borne zoonotic pathogens, particularly
the serotype O157: H7, which is the most common
cause of haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic uraemic
syndrome in humans [3]. Ruminants, especially cattle,
have been identified as the major reservoirs of STEC
and also serve as the major source of human infections
[4]. STEC exhibit antibiotic resistance due to the
presence of plasmid carrying genes for drug resistance.

Class 1 integrons located on mobile plasmids have
facilitated the emergence and dissemination of
antimicrobial resistance among STEC in humans and
food animals [5]. These antimicrobial-resistant Shiga
toxin-producing E.coliin food-producing animals can
pose a global public health hazard because of potential
transmission from animals to humans. In view of the
importance of STEC as an emerging zoonotic
pathogen, it has been the subject of several studies
including their resistance to antibiotics. In India
antibiotic resistance of STEC has been reported
including multi drug resistance in both animals [6,7]
and humans [8,9] from various parts of India, but there
is paucity of information on this aspect in Jammu
region. Relatively less information exists about
antibiotic resistance of STEC in cattle and buffalo
handlers of the region.

With this concern, this study was undertaken to
determine the antibiotic resistance pattern of Shiga
toxin-producing E.coliisolated from bovines as well
as their handlers of the area.

a Thermocycler (Applied Biosystems Gene Amp PCR
System 2400) with heated lid using the steps and cycle
conditions as: initial denaturation at 95 C for 2 minutes
followed by 15 cycles; each cycle consisting of
denaturation at 95 C for 1 minute, annealing at 65 C for
2 minutes and extension for 1.5 minutes at 72 C. A
second phase of 20 cycles was followed with each
cycle consisting of denaturation for 1 minute at 95 C,
annealing at 60 C for 2 minutes and extension for 2
minutes at 72 C. A final extension was done at 72 C for
5 minutes. The PCR product was analysed by agarose 
gel electrophoresis for the amplicon sizes of 180 bp,
255 bp, 384 bp and 534 bp.

Of the total 126 isolates subjected to mPCR
(Figure-1), a total of fifteen E.coliisolates revealed the
presence of Shiga-toxin producing (stx) genes; nine
isolates were obtained from cattle, three from buffaloes
and three from bovine handlers. Twelve of the 15 STEC
isolates (80%) showed resistance to three or more
antibiotics (multi drug resistance). Chloramphenicol
was the most effective with 86.6% sensitivity followed
by Norfloxacin with 80% sensitivity observed among
the isolates. Further, 73.3% of the STEC isolates were
sensitive to Ciprofloxacin and Co-trimoxazole, 60 % to
Gentamicin, 53.3% to Nalidixic acid and 46.6% to
Cefuroxime (Table-2).

Among STEC isolates from cattle, Chloram-
phenicol was the most effective with 88.8% sensitivity
while Amikacin was the most resistant with 88.8%
resistance observed among the isolates. Further, 77.7%
of the STEC isolates were sensitive to Co-trimoxazole
and Norfloxacin, 66.6% to Ciprofloxacin and 55.5% to
Gentamicin and Nalidixic acid. Three of the four STEC

were resistant to three or more antibiotics while the
fourth isolate was resistant only to Amoxicillin. One
isolate carrying only stx gene was resistant only to
Amikacin. Further, all the other four STEC isolates;
two isolates carrying stx,stx,eaeAand hlyAgenes and
the other two with stx,eaeA and hlyA genes were
multi-drug resistant. Two of the three STEC isolates
from buffaloes with virulence gene profile as stx,stx,1
hlyAand stx,stxshowed sensitivity to Chloramphe-
nicol, Ciprofloxacin, Co-trimoxazole, Gentamicin and
Norfloxacin. However, the former showed resistance
only to Ampicillin while as the latter was resistant to
Ampicillin, Amoxycillin, Cefotaxime, Streptomycin
and Cefuroxime. Also one isolate bearing stx,stx,1
eaeA and hlyA genes was resistant to most of the
antibiotics tested. All the three STEC isolates from bacterial
bovine handlers were resistant to Ampicillin, Amoxy-
cillin and Amikacin and sensitive to Chloramphenicol,
Ciprofloxacin and Norfloxacin. Two of these isolates
one with stxgene and another possessing stxandeaeA
genes were sensitive to Gentamicin also, and the isolate
with stx,stx and hlyAgenes was sensitive to Nalidixic
acid.

(29%) was also observed in Spain both from cattle and
humans, however, lower resistance was observed with
Ampicillin (10%), Co-trimoxazole (8%) and Kanamycin
(7%) [12]. High resistance among STEC isolated from
diverse sources has also been reported in other studies
[13,14]. However, resistance of STEC to Ampicillin,
Gentamicin, Kanamycin, Nalidixic acid, Tetracycline,
Streptomycin and Cefuroxime isolated from humans
[15] and Ampicillin, Gentamicin and Kanamycin
isolated from cattle in Japan [16] were lower compared
to our results. Lower resistance of STEC to Amikacin
and Gentamicin from cattle and with Ampicillin,
Amoxicillin, Cefuroxime, Gentamicin and Tetracycline
from humans was also recorded in Brazil and
Switzerland respectively [17,18]. These differences
could be due to varied genetic mechanisms that lead to
resistance and their spread in bacterial
population enabled by highly efficient transfer system
of mobile genetic elements [19]. Also, during the
the importance of integrons for the
recent years,
dissemination of
resistance in E.colihas been
established [5].

Multi drug resistance of STEC isolates including
high resistance to Amikacin (80%), Ampicillin (73%)
and Tetracycline (63%) from calves has earlier been
reported from Gujarat state of India [6]. Similar
resistance to Tetracycline (32%) and Streptomycin

Resistance  to  ampicillin  and  amoxycillin 
observed in the present study might be attributed to the 
production  of  β-lactamase  group  of  penicillin 
destroying enzymes. These enzymes are chromosome 
or plasmid borne, and may be constitutive or inducible
[20]. Resistance to aminoglycosides is due to
aminoglycoside modifying enzymes e.g., amikacin

resistance in E.coliis associated with aminoglycoside
phosphotransferase coded by a transferable plasmid-
borne gene [21]. Rapid transferability  of  extended 
spectrum  β-lactamase  (ESBL)  genes  among  E.coli
including STEC by conjugation may account for
resistance to cephalosporins [22]. High resistance of
STEC isolates especially to ampicillin, amikacin,
cefixime and tetracycline observed in the present study
may be due to extensive use of these antibiotics in farm
animals or humans which exerts a selection pressure on
microbes encouraging the growth of resistant ones.
C on clu sion

In the present study, multi-drug resistance pattern
(resistance to atleast
three antibiotics) was found
among eighty percent of the STEC isolates. However,
high sensitivity of STEC isolates to Chloramphenicol,
Norfloxacin and Gentamicin was observed. This
resistance pattern among the STEC especially high
resistance to the frequently used antibiotics in both
bovines and their handlers implies that resistance is
often acquired due to their indiscriminate use, thereby,
creating a need towards rational and judicious use of
antibiotics in the field.
