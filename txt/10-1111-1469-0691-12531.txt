Running title: Chromosomal blaCTX-M-2 in E. coli 

 

Keywords: Brazil, ESBL, qnr, poultry, food-producing animals 

 

ABSTRACT 

The rise of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli in 

food-producing  animals  is  a  growing  concern  for  public  health.  We  investigated  ESBL 

producers isolated from broiler chickens in Brazil and characterized 19 CTX-M-2-producing 

E. coli. The blaCTX-M-2 gene was detected downstream to ISCR1 element, associated with sul-

1 type integron, chromosome-located. CTX-M-2-producing E. coli exhibited different PFGE-

types  and  phylogenetic  groups,  showing  a  non-clonal  dissemination.  The  sequence  types 

found (ST93, ST155 and ST2309) have been associated to humans and animals worldwide. 

Herein, we report the chromosomal location of blaCTX-M-2 on E. coli, alerting for the risks of 

multi-drug resistant bacteria in food-producing animals. 

 

Prophylactic  antibiotics  are  used  in  poultry  production  to  prevent  gastrointestinal 

infections  and  thus  improve  the  performance  of  commercial  broilers.  The  prevalence  of 

extended-spectrum  beta-lactamase  (ESBL)-producing  Escherichia  coli  colonizing  the 

intestinal  tract  of  healthy  food-producing  animals,  including  poultry,  has  increased 

worldwide  [1].  There  is  a  risk  of  transmission  of  poultry-associated  ESBL-producing 

Enterobacteriaceae to humans [2]. Many genetic platforms associated with mobilization and 

support of blaCTX-M were identified, specially ISEcp1 and ISCR1elements, where the latter is 

particularly  important  for  blaCTX-M-2  dissemination  [3].  In  this  study,  we  report  different 

clones of CTX-M-2-producing E. coli, with chromosomal-located gene.

From 2011 to 2012, two-hundred cloacal swabs were harvested from healthy broilers 

in two poultry farms from São Paulo State, Brazil. Swabs were seeded onto MacConkey agar 

plates containing 1mg/L of cefotaxime and also on plates containing 1mg/L of ceftazidime, 

and incubated for 24h/37ºC. From each sample, one colony per morphotype was selected and 

identified by the API 20E test (BioMérieux, France). ESBL-producing E. coli were screened 

by double disk synergism using cefotaxime and ceftazidime plus amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, 

which  showed  19  (9,5%)  isolates  with  ESBL  phenotype.  The  blaTEM,  blaSHV,  blaCTX  and 

blaOXA genes were searched by PCR and the sequencing confirmed the presence of blaCTX-M-2 

gene  in  these  isolates  using  primers  described  previously  [4].  The  genetic  environment  of 

blaCTX-M-2 was identified following previously described methods [5]. The ISCR1 was found 

upstream  of  the  blaCTX-M-2  and  the  resistance  gene  was  associated  with  sul-1  type  integron 

structure.  The  susceptibility  test  was  performed  by  agar  disk  diffusion  method  using  beta-

lactams  amoxillin/clavulanic  acid,  piperacillin/tazobactam,  cefotaxime,  ceftazidime, 

cefepime,  cefoxitin,  aztreonam,  ertapenem  and  non-beta-lactams,  nalidixic  acid  (NAL), 

ciprofloxacin 

(CIP), 

levofloxacin 

(LVX), 

tetracycline 

(TET),  gentamicin 

(GEN), 

trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  (SXT)  and  chloramphenicol  (CHL).  The  results  were 

evaluated  according  to  the  Clinical  Laboratory  Standards  Institute  recommendations  [6].  

Most  isolates  showed  resistance  to  all  beta-lactams  tested,  with  100%  susceptibility  to 

ertapenem. All isolates showed resistance to the non-beta-lactam antibiotics CIP, LVX, NAL 

and TET, 73.7% (14/19) were resistant to GEN and SXT and 31.5% (6/19) were resistant to 

CHL (Fig. 1).  

Plasmid-mediated  resistance  to  quinolone  antibiotics  associated  to  the  CTX-M-2-

producing  E.  coli  was  checked  by  PCR  based  on  the  presence  of  qnrA,  qnrB,  qnrS,  and 

acc(6’)-Ib-cr genes, as described elsewhere [7]. Two isolates presented qnrB19 gene (Fig. 1).

The phylogenetic group characterization, following the methods previously described 

[8], identified 68.5% (13/19) from phylogenetic group A, 26.3% (5/19) isolates from group D 

and  5.2%  (1/19)  from  group  B1  (Fig.  1).  Moreover,  genomic  relationship  was  analysed  by 

pulsed-field  gel  electrophoresis  (PFGE)  using  CHEF  DRIII  PFGE  System  (Biorad,  USA) 

after enzymatic digestion with XbaI. Results were evaluated using the Bionumerics Software 

version 5.01 (Applied Maths, USA) and the isolates were considered from the same PFGE-

type when the genomic similarity was greater than 85% (Fig. 1). Therefore, according to the 

criteria  used,  the  19  CTX-M-2-producing  E.  coli  isolates  belong  to  6  PFGE-types.  Four 

different PFGE-types (A, B, C and D) were found among the 6 isolates from farm 1. In farm 

2,  two  PFGE-types  (E  and  F)  were  found  among  the  13  isolates.  The  relatedness  between 

PFGE-types from both farms was at most 75% (Fig. 1). The MLST, carried out according to 

the  'Achtman  scheme'  (http://mlst.ucc.ie/dbs/Ecoli),  showed  three  sequence  types  (STs). 

ST2309  was  not  assigned  to  any  clonal  complex  (CC)  to  date,  furthermore  it  was  only 

described in broilers. ST93 was ascribed to CC168 and ST155 to CC155 (Fig. 1). ST93 was 

dominant  among  isolates  and  together  with  ST155,  has  been  associated  to  humans  and 

animals worldwide [9-11].  

Plasmids  were  searched  and  characterized  following  the  PCR-based  replicon  typing 

method [12]. All 19 ESBL-producing isolates presented replicons F, B/O, K, I1 and FIB. The 

PFGE after S1-nuclease digestion, the Southern blot and hybridization with specific probes 

were  performed  to  search  for  blaCTX-M-2  gene  in  plasmids,  however  it  was  not  found.  The 

method  was  repeated  after  I-Ceu-I-PFGE  using  probes  for  E.  coli  16S  rRNA  gene  and  for 

blaCTX-M-2  to  evaluate  chromosomal  localization.  These  probes  hybridized  in  the  same 

position, confirming the insertion of blaCTX-M-2 in the chromosome (Fig. 2) of all 19 ESBL 

isolates. Moreover, to check the possibility of chromosomal integration of the plasmids along

with the resistance gene, probes for each replicon (F, B/O, K, I1 and FIB) were used in the 

same membrane. Nevertheless, no plasmids were integrated in the chromosome. 

All isolates were considered multidrug-resistant (non-susceptible) to at least one agent 

in three or more antimicrobial categories) [13], showing an important reservoir of resistance 

genes  in  these  food-producing  animals.  The  blaCTX-M-2  gene  is  the  most  prevalent  ESBL-

encoding gene in human E. coli isolates in Brazil [14] and is frequently reported in animals 

and environmental sources [1]. Although blaCTX-M genes are usually harboured in plasmids, 

the chromosomal insertion of these genes was found in E. coli [15-17]. Herein, we showed 

the chromosomal blaCTX-M-2 in diverse E. coli isolates. The ISCR1 found in these CTX-M-2 

producing  E.  coli  isolates  has  been  associated  with  the  mobilization  of  CTX-M-encoding 

genes in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens [18].  

The  quinolone  resistance  detected  in  all  E.  coli  isolates  might  be  related  to 

chromosomal mutations in quinolone-resistance-determining region or associated with other 

resistance  mechanisms  (e.g.  porin  deficiencies,  overexpressing  of  efflux).  Nevertheless,  the 

presence of qnr gene may represent risk of dissemination of co-resistance in bacteria [19]. 

Our 

findings  suggest 

that 

the  continuous  use  of  subinhibitory  antibiotic 

concentrations,  in  the  poultry  environment,  may  promote  the  genetic  recombination  in  E. 

coli, as shown elsewhere [20]. This hypothesis is supported due to different PFGE-types and 

phylogenetic groups detected, pointing to non-clonal dissemination of chromosome-encoding 

CTX-M-2 in E. coli. The stability of the chromosomal blaCTX-M-2 in bacterial strains is still to 

be elucidated. 

In  summary,  this  study  identified  19  CTX-M-2-producing  E.  coli  isolated  in  Brazil 

from  commercial  broilers  for  human  consumption,  and  characterised  the  insertion  of  the 

blaCTX-M-2 into the bacterial chromosome.
