Received 4 May 2007; returned 26 June 2007; revised 25 July 2007; accepted 31 July 2007

Objectives: To assess the occurrence of extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs) in Escherichia coli
isolates of faecal samples of animals (n 5 40) and food samples (n 5 38) obtained in Tunisia in 2006,
and to characterize the type of ESBLs, their genetic environments and the associated resistance
genes.

Methods: Samples were inoculated in supplemented media (2 mg/L cefotaxime) for isolation of broad-
spectrum cephalosporin-resistant E. coli
isolates (one isolate/sample). ESBLs and their genetic
environments as well as integrons and their gene cassette composition were characterized by PCR
and sequencing.

Results: ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were detected in 10 of the 38 food samples analysed (26%)
and in none of the tested animal faecal samples. Genes found were as follows (number of isolates):
blaCTX-M-1 (5), blaCTX-M-1 1 bla TEM-1b (1), bla CTX-M-14 1 bla TEM-1b (2), blaCTX-M-8 (1) and blaSHV-5 (1). All
ESBL-positive isolates showed unrelated PFGE patterns. ISEcp1 and IS903 were detected surrounding
blaCTX-M-14, and ISEcp1/IS26 and orf477 surrounding some of the blaCTX-M-1 genes. Four of the ESBL-
positive strains harboured class 1 integrons including different gene cassette combinations.

Conclusions: ESBLs, mainly of the CTX-M class, are detected in E. coli of food origin in Tunisia, being
the ﬁrst time that this mechanism has been detected in food E. coli strains in Africa.

Introduction

The detection of clinical Escherichia coli
isolates producing
extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs) has been increasingly
reported in the last few years in a wide variety of countries,
including Tunisia,1 – 3 and represents a clinical problem in human
medicine.2 In addition, a new class of ESBL enzymes has
emerged,
the CTX-M class, which is dramatically spreading
among human clinical E. coli isolates, mainly in those recovered
from the community.1,4 A few reports have recently appeared
referring to the detection of ESBL-containing E. coli strains in
animal and food samples in different countries of Europe and
Asia,5 – 8 but to our knowledge, never in Tunisia or in other
African countries. The objective of our study was to detect

ESBL-containing E. coli in faecal samples of food-producing
animals as well as in food samples of animal origin in Tunisia
and to characterize the type of ESBL enzymes, their genetic
environments and the associated resistance genes.

Materials and methods

Samples and E. coli isolates

A total of 40 faecal samples of healthy animals were recovered
either from farm animals (6 chickens, 16 cattle and 14 horses) or
from veterinary clinics (2 cats and 2 dogs). In those samples
obtained in farms, one lot of animals (50 – 60 animals for chickens,

sample. In addition, 38 food samples of animal origin were also
included in this study, and they were obtained either from different
supermarkets or from a food laboratory of Tunis (23 samples of
beef, 8 of chicken, 2 of turkey, 1 of sheep and 4 of ﬁsh). All
samples of food and animal origin were obtained in the North of
Tunisia during 2006.

Samples were suspended in sterile saline solution and then were
seeded on MacConkey agar plates supplemented with 2 mg/L
cefotaxime and incubated for 24 h at 378C. Isolates with typical
E. coli morphology were selected (one per sample) and identiﬁed
by classical biochemical methods, as well as by a species-speciﬁc

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

E. coli isolates recovered from the antibiotic-supplemented MacConkey
agar plates were submitted to susceptibility testing for 17 anti-
microbial agents by the disc diffusion method according to the
CLSI criteria.9 The antimicrobial agents tested were as follows
(mg): ampicillin (10), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (20 þ 10), cefoxi-
tin (30), ceftazidime (30), cefotaxime (30), aztreonam (30), imipe-
nem (10), gentamicin (10), amikacin (30),
tobramycin (10),
streptomycin (10), nalidixic acid (30), ciproﬂoxacin (5), sulfa-
methoxazole (300), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (1.25 þ 23.75),
tetracycline (30) and chloramphenicol (30). The MICs of nalidixic
acid and ciproﬂoxacin were also determined by the agar dilution
method in all quinolone-resistant E. coli isolates.9 A screening test
for the detection of ESBLs was carried out by the double disc diffu-
sion test (using cefotaxime, ceftazidime and amoxicillin/clavulanic
acid discs) according to the CLSI criteria.9 E. coli ATCC 25922 was
used as a quality control strain.

and sequencing (on both strands).5,6 Nucleotide segments and their
deduced amino acid sequences were compared with those included
in the GenBank database as well as with those deposited at the web
site http://www.lahey.org/Studies/, in order to ascribe the speciﬁc
type of b-lactamase gene. Positive and negative controls were
included in all PCR assays. The presence of ISEcp1, IS26, orf477
or IS903 sequences surrounding the blaCTX-M genes was analysed
by PCR using primers and conditions as previously described;10 all
obtained amplicons were sequenced for conﬁrmation.

The promoter and attenuator region of the chromosomal ampC
gene was also ampliﬁed by PCR, sequenced and compared with the

same region of the E. coli K12 ampC gene, to analyse the mutations
associated with the overexpression of this gene.5

Characterization of integrons and resistance mechanisms to
non-b-lactam antimicrobial agents

The presence of genes associated with tetracycline [tet(A) and
tet(B)], streptomycin [aadA1 and aadA2], sulfamethoxazole [sul1,
sul2 and sul3] and gentamicin [aac(3)-I, aac(3)-II and aac(3)-IV]
resistance was studied by PCR.11 gyrA and parC genes were ampli-
ﬁed by PCR in all quinolone-resistant E. coli
isolates, and the
obtained sequences were compared with those previously reported
for gyrA (GenBank accession number X06373) and parC (M58408
with the modiﬁcation included in L22025) genes.11 The presence of
the genes encoding class 1 and class 2 integrases was examined by
PCR and the gene cassettes included in the variable region of class
1 integrons were detected by PCR and sequencing.11

PFGE patterns of E. coli isolates

The clonal relationship between the strains was studied by PFGE,
using XbaI as a restriction enzyme.11

cephalosporin-resistant E. coli isolates were recovered from 11
of these samples (14%), and ESBL-containing E. coli isolates
were detected in 10 of them (13%), when the double disc
screening test was used (Table 1). All of them were isolated

ESBL-containing E. coli isolates was detected among the tested
animal faecal samples. The difference observed in the preva-
lence of ESBL-positive E. coli isolates in faecal animal samples
in relation to the food animal samples might have different
reasons. The animals from which food and faecal samples were
obtained were grown in non-related farms. On the other hand,
although the E. coli contamination of food is expected to be due
to faecal E. coli at
the slaughterhouse level, contamination
during the transformation or commercialization processes of
food cannot be excluded.

these genetic determinants.2

Genetic environments of blaCTX-M genes

Figure 1 shows the genetic environments of blaCTX-M genes
detected among our ESBL-positive E. coli isolates. orf477 was
detected downstream of blaCTX-M-1 in all six strains that har-
boured that ESBL gene. The sequence of the fragment obtained
by PCR upstream of the blaCTX-M-1 gene in three of the E. coli
strains (C920, C924 and C925) revealed the presence of a region
of the IS26 transposase (211 bp) ﬂanking a partially truncated
ISEcp1 whose size was 214 bp and followed by an intergenic
region (32 þ 48 bp, named by Eckert et al.10 as XþW
sequences, respectively). This whole structure was similar (98%)
to that previously described in E. coli 5402 with the EMBL
accession number AJ416342. The upstream region of
the
blaCTX-M-1 gene in the remaining three E. coli strains (C922,
C923 and C926) could not be identiﬁed because all PCRs
performed were negative. The presence of ISEcp1 and IS903
was demonstrated upstream and downstream, respectively, of the
blaCTX-M-14 gene in E. coli C929 and C930, and an intergenic
region of 42 bp ( previously named as the Y region10) was found
between ISEcp1 and blaCTX-M-14 (Figure 1).

All PCRs for detection of ISEcp1, IS26, orf477 or IS903
sequences surrounding the blaCTX-M-8 gene were negative in our
E. coli strain C921. The role of IS26 and ISEcp1 insertion
sequences in the mobilization and insertion of blaCTX-M genes
has been previously described.10

Mechanism of resistance in a broad-spectrum
cephalosporin-resistant and ESBL-negative E. coli strain

A broad-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant ESBL-negative strain
(E. coli C927) was recovered in a turkey food sample of this

study. blaTEM-1b was the unique acquired b-lactamase gene
detected in this strain. The promoter/attenuator region of the
chromosomal ampC gene of this strain was sequenced and three
changes in the nucleotide sequence were detected at positions
228, þ52 and þ72, but no mutations were observed at the
important 242 and 232 positions, associated with broad-
spectrum cephalosporin resistance.5

Mechanism of resistance to non-b-lactam antimicrobial
agents

Table 1 shows the pattern of resistance to non-b-lactam antimi-
crobial agents in all 11 broad-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant
E. coli strains. Six of the strains showed resistance to at least
three of the tested non-b-lactam antimicrobial agents. A variety
of resistance genes were observed among our strains: tet(A) or
tet(B) (in the seven tetracycline-resistant strains), aadA1 with/
without aadB (in ﬁve streptomycin-resistant strains), sul1 with/
without sul2 (in ﬁve sulphonamide-resistant strains), aac(3)-II
(in three gentamicin-resistant strains) and dfrA1 (in three tri-
methoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant strains). The presence of
class 1 integrons was demonstrated in 5 of the 11 cephalosporin-
resistant strains and two different gene cassette combinations
were identiﬁed (Table 1).

Amino acid changes in GyrA and ParC proteins were observed
among our six quinolone-resistant strains. Five of the strains
showed nalidixic acid resistance (MICs of 128– 512 mg/L), being
ciproﬂoxacin susceptible (MICs of 0.125– 0.5 mg/L), and one
amino acid change in the GyrA protein (but not in ParC) was
observed (Ser-83!Leu or Ser-83!Ala or Asp-87!Tyr). The
remaining quinolone-resistant strain (E. coli C930) showed a
high-level nalidixic acid and ciproﬂoxacin resistance phenotype
(MICs of 2048 and 128 mg/L, respectively), and two amino
in both GyrA (Ser-83!Leu þ Asp-87!Asn)
acid changes
and ParC (Ser-80!Ile þ Glu-84!Gly) proteins were identiﬁed
(Table 1).

Conclusions

A high percentage of food samples were colonized by ESBL-con-
taining E. coli strains (26%), mainly of the CTX-M class. In
addition, certain associations between animal species and CTX-M
types seem to occur: CTX-M-1 has been detected in strains recov-
ered from food samples of beef origin and the CTX-M-14 or
CTX-M-8 enzymes in those of chicken origin. The use of cepha-
losporins in food-producing animals could be a selective factor
for
the appearance of ESBL-containing bacteria in animals.
Nevertheless, due to the fact that most of the ESBL-containing
E. coli isolates recovered either from animals or from humans
harbour a wide variety of resistance genes to non-b-lactam antimi-
crobial agents,
the possibility of co-selection by the use of
non-b-lactams could happen and this fact should be extensively
evaluated in the future.
