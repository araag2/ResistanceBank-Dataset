Cattle are the main asymptomatic reservoir of Escherichia coli O157:H7 which can cause illness to human. The
objectives of the study were to measure the prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 on cattle slaughtered in Amman
abattoir, detect virulence factors in the isolates, determine antibacterial resistance of the isolates, and know
how the isolates are different or similar when compared to characterized isolates from developed countries.
A total of 540 samples (feces, hide, and carcass) were tested for E. coli O157:H7 using the method of ISO
16654:(E). Conventional and multiplex PCR assays were used for serotype conﬁrmation and virulence factor
detection, respectively. Fifty E. coli O157:H7 isolates were identiﬁed and virulence factors eaeA and hlyA were
present in all of the isolates. 60%, 12%, and 22% of the isolates harbored stx1, stx2, and stx1 and stx2, respectively.
The prevalence rates of enterotoxigenic E. coli O157:H7 (n=47) were 8.3%, 10%, and 7.8% in feces, hides and
carcasses, respectively. The antimicrobial proﬁles of the isolates showed an extensive resistance to erythromycin,
neomycin and vancomycin and high sensitivity to ampicillin, ciproﬂoxacin, gentamicin, kanamycin and
tetracycline.

1. Introduction

Escherichia coli O157:H7 is foodborne pathogen that can cause hem-
orrhagic colitis (HC) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) to human
(Gooding & Choudary, 1997). The virulence factor associated with
these illnesses is the Shiga-like toxin which is encoded by stx1 and stx2
genes of the pathogen (Nataro & Kaper, 1998; O'Brien & Holmes,
1987). E. coli O157:H7 strains also harbor a virulence factor called
intimin for attachment to the host intestinal epithelial cells encoded
by the eaeA gene (Boerling, McEwen, Wilson, Johnson, & Gyles, 1999)
and may have additional virulence factors such as the enterohemolysin
encoded by ehxA gene (Schmidt, Beutin, & Karch, 1995).

Cattle are considered the main asymptomatic reservoir of E. coli
O157:H7 and play a vital role in human infection (Chapman, Siddons,
Cerdan Malo, & Harkin, 1997; Nataro & Kaper, 1998). The organism is
carried in the gastrointestinal tract and is shed in the feces (Bach,
McCallister, Mears, & Schwartzkopf-Genswein, 2004), thus, this patho-
gen can be found on cattle hides (Arthur et al., 2004; Elder et al., 2000).
Hide contamination may occur from direct or indirect fecal contamina-
tion during production and in lairage environments (Arthur et al.,
2010). E. coli O157:H7 can be transmitted to carcass surfaces when

gut contents or fecal materials get in contact with meat surfaces during
the processes of skinning and evisceration (Dickson & Anderson, 1992).
Contaminated undercooked ground beef has been the most frequently
identiﬁed vehicle of E. coli O157:H7 in the foodborne outbreaks
(Barret et al., 1994).

Earlier studies have reported the prevalence rate of E. coli O157:
H7 in cattle fecal samples, and on hide and carcasses in the range of
2.4 to 24% (Alam & Zurek, 2006; Alonso et al., 2007; Jacob, Almes,
Shi, Sargeant, & Nagaraja, 2011; McEvoy et al., 2003), 11 to 76 %
(Arthur et al., 2004; Elder et al., 2000), and 0.2 to 26.7 % (Alonso et
al., 2007; Barkocy-Gallagher et al., 2003; FSIS, 1994; McEvoy et al.,
2003; Vanderlinde, Shay, & Murray, 1998), respectively. In a local
study in Jordan; the prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in calves' fecal
samples was 7.9% (Abu-Ashour, 2003).

Antimicrobials are widely used in cattle for disease prevention and
as growth promotion (Mora et al., 2005). There are some signals indicat-
ing that antimicrobial resistance of E. coli O157:H7 is rising (Threlfall,
Ward, Frost, & Willshaw, 2000). In Jordan, two studies were reported
on the antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli O157:H7 isolated from
sheep and goat. The ﬁrst study showed that the isolated pathogen was
highly sensitive to gentamicin and co-trimoxazole and highly resistant
to tetracycline and ampicillin (Tarawneh, Al-Tawarah, Abdel-Ghani,
Al-Majali, & Khleifat, 2008). The second study revealed that all lamb
isolates were resistant against one or more of the tested antibiotics.
One isolate was resistant to chloramphenicol, and sulphonamide, anoth-
er isolate was resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, sulphonamide,
and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole) and ﬁve isolates

464

were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and
sulphonamide. One isolate showed a multi resistance pattern against
ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ceftazidime, aztreonam, gentamicin,
cephalothin, streptomycin, sulphonamide, tetracycline, trimetho-
prim and sulfamethoxazole (Novotna et al., 2005). Harakeh et al.
(2005) reported that 100% and 63.5% of tested E. coli O157:H7 from
meat-based fast food in Lebanon were resistant to erythromycin
and vancomycin, respectively.

Because of lack of information on the prevalence of E. coli O157:H7
in dressed beef cattle in Jordan, this work was conducted to deter-
mine: i) the prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 on hides and carcasses
and in feces of cattle slaughtered in Amman abattoir to determine
the relation between the presence of E. coli O157:H7 on beef meat
and speciﬁc handling practices, ii) the presence of different virulence
factors in isolated E. coli O157:H7, and iii) and the antibacterial resis-
tance proﬁles of the isolates. The study also aimed in keeping up with
isolate characteristics for any global changes in antimicrobial suscep-
tibility patterns, isolate distribution and similarities and prevalence of
common virulence factors.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Reference bacterial strains

The reference bacterial strains used in this study were E. coli O157:
H7 (ATCC 43895) as positive control and non-toxigenic E. coli O157:
H7 (NCTC 12900) as a negative control.

2.2. Sample collection

A total of 540 samples representing 180 feces, 180 hide, and 180
carcass samples were collected from calves slaughtered at Amman
slaughter house during the period from January to May 2010 to investi-
gate the presence of E. coli O157:H7. Amman slaughterhouse, a manual-
ly operated gravity rail system, is a public abattoir that is located in
Amman City with a design capacity of 25–30 head per h and with
slaughtering average of 80–100 calves per day. Most slaughtered
animals were imported calves (Australia, Romania, Uruguay and Brazil)
that were reared for 3–6 months in farms located 80–100 km eastern to
Amman before being delivered for slaughtering. Each of the above 180
samples represents a composite sample from three different animals.
The fecal sample (100 g) was collected from colon contents of
slaughtered animals; longitudinal incisions were made aseptically in
the colon to obtain a representative sample of the fecal content. Hide
was sampled by cutting a piece representing an area of 10×10 cm
(100 cm2) from the hide from each of three different locations (back,
belly, and thigh). The meat was sampled by slicing a thin meat slices
(thickness 1–1.5 cm) from external surfaces from each of three differ-
ent locations (leg, ﬂank and neck) of the post-washed carcass The
samples were then transferred to the laboratory in sterile containers
under aseptic conditions using an ice box. Samples were processed
within 2–3 h after collection.

2.3. Isolation of E. coli O157:H7 using conventional bacteriological methods

2.3.1. Pre-enrichment, selective enrichment and immunomagnetic
separation

The method described by ISO 16654: (E) (2001) was followed for the
isolation of E. coli O157:H7. Twenty ﬁve grams of each sample (hide,
meat and feces) was placed in Stomacher bag (Seward, UK) containing
225 ml of modiﬁed tryptone soy broth (m-TSB) (Oxoid, Ltd., Basingstoke,
UK) supplemented with 20 mg/l novobiocine (Oxoid). After stomacher
homogenization for 2 min at 320 rpm, the samples were incubated for
6 h at 41.5 °C. After that, 1 ml from the pre-enriched homogenate was
added to 20 μl magnetic beads coated with speciﬁc antibody against
O157 (Dynabeads anti E. coli O157, Prod. Dynal, Norway) in a 1.5 ml

Eppendorf tube. Afterward, immunomagnetic separation (IMS) was
performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.

2.3.2. Isolation of E. coli O157:H7

Fifty microliter quantities of the suspension obtained after performing
the IMS were plated on Ceﬁxime Tellurite-Sorbitol MacConkey agar
(CT-SMAC) (Oxoid) and CHROMagar (Dynal Prod.). The plates were in-
cubated at 37 °C for 22 h for CT-SMAC agar and for 24 h for CHROMagar.
Five typical colorless colonies (sorbitol negative) from CT-SMAC or
mauve colonies from CHROMagar were plated on tryptone soy agar+
yeast extract (TSA-YE) (Oxoid), and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, for
puriﬁcation and running conﬁrmatory tests as described below.

2.3.3. Conﬁrmatory tests for E. coli O157 and E. coli O157:H7

The pinpoint indole assay was conducted on the suspected isolates.
One typical colony was picked up and placed in one drop of indole
reagent (Oxoid) using ﬁlter paper. Mauve color reaction indicated
positive results. Indole-positive colonies were streaked onto Sorbitol
MacConkey agar with BCIG (SMAC- BCIG), (Oxoid) and incubated at
37 °C for overnight. Colonies that did not show ﬂuorescence on the
SMAC- BCIG agar when illuminated with UV light (366 nm) were
recognized as the distinctive characteristics of E. coli O157 species.

All sorbitol-negative,

indole-positive, BCIG-negative isolates
were sub-cultured on TSA-YE and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The
obtained isolates were inspected by latex agglutination using the
E. coli O157 antiserum (Oxoid) followed by H7 antisera (Remel Inc,
KS, USA). Colonies that showed a positive agglutination reaction
with O157 antiserum were considered as E. coli O157, whereas colo-
nies that showed positive agglutination reaction with the H7 antise-
rum were considered as E. coli O157:H7.

2.4. Molecular conﬁrmation and virulence factor detection of E. coli O157:H7

E. coli O157:H7 reference strain and E. coli O157:H7 isolates were
cultured on TSA-YE at 37 °C for 24 h, and then sub-cultured into soya
broth (SB) (Oxoid) for additional 24 h. Thereafter, 1 ml of the suspen-
sion was transferred into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes to extract the
DNA. The genomic DNA was isolated from the reference strain and
bacterial isolates using Promega Wizard® Genomic DNA Puriﬁcation
Kit (Promega, USA) as per manufacturer's instructions.

The extracted DNAs were used for serotype (O157 and H7) conﬁr-
mation (presence of rfbEO157 and ﬂiCh7 genes) and virulence factor
(stx1, stx2, eaeA and hlyA) detection in E. coli O157:H7 isolates. The
primers (Thermo Electron, MA, USA) used in this analysis are presented
in Table 1. The methods described by Desmarchelier et al. (1998)
and Fratamico, Bagi, and Pepe (2000) were followed in conventional
PCR assay for serotype conﬁrmation and the methods described by
Fratamico et al. (2000) and Sarimehmetoglu et al. (2009) were followed
in multiplex PCR assay for virulence factor detection in the E. coli O157:

H7 isolates. Thermal cycling was conducted in Veriti Thermal cycler
(Applied Biosystems, USA) and PCR products were visualized with UV
transilluminator and photographed with the gel documentation system
(Gel Doc 2000, BIO-RAD, USA).

2.5. Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents-microbroth dilution method

E. coli O157:H7 isolates in addition to the reference bacterial strain
E. coli O157:H7 (ATCC 43895) were maintained on TSA-YE. Active
cultures were prepared by growing the isolates and the reference
strain in 10 ml quantities of Mueller–Hinton broth (MHB) (Oxoid).
The densities of bacterial growth in MHB were standardized at ca.
1.5×108 CFU/ml and were adjusted according to McFarland standard
solution. To determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of
antimicrobials against tested strains in MHB at 37 °C, the microbroth
dilution method described by Lalitha (2008) was followed. The MIC
values of the isolates and the reference strain were compared
to breakpoint values from international standards or published re-
searches (BSAC, 2008; Fitzgerald et al., 2003; NCCLS, 1999; Soussy,
Cluzel, Courvalin, & the Comite de Antibiogramme de la Societe
Francaise be Microbiologie, 1994).

2.5.1. Statistical analysis

The differences among numbers of contaminated samples (carcasses,
hides and feces) with enterotoxigenic E. coli O157:H7 were tested by
Chi-square test using SAS program, version 8.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC). Signiﬁcance level is considered at ≤0.05.

3. Results

3.1. Isolation of E. coli O157:H7 by conventional bacteriological method

The number of samples with typical E. coli O157:H7 characteristics
on CT-SMAC or CHROMagar was 63 samples (22 feces samples, 17
hide samples, and 24 carcass samples). All of the presumptively identi-
ﬁed E. coli O157:H7 isolates from the tested samples were positive for
spot indole test and presence of O157 antigen, whereas, 55 of them
(87%) were positive for presence of H7 antigen using latex agglutination
antisera (Table 2).

3.3. Detection of virulence factors in the conﬁrmed E. coli O157:H7 using
multiplex PCR

Multiplex PCR results revealed that all of the 50 conﬁrmed E. coli
O157:H7 isolates harbored both intimin and enterohemolysin (eaeA
and hlyA) virulent genes while 47 (94%) of the isolates revealed the
presence of stx1 and/or stx2 virulence genes; 30 (60%), 6 (12%), and 11
(22%) isolates harbored stx1, stx2, and both genes, respectively. The 3
isolates (6%) that did not have stxs genes were isolated from hides (1
isolate) and feces (2 isolates). The 47 molecularly conﬁrmed enterotoxi-
genic E. coli O157:H7 were distributed between 15 isolates from feces
(8.3%), 18 isolates for hides (10%) and 14 isolates from carcasses
(7.8%) (Table 3). There were no signiﬁcant differences (P>0.05)
among the contamination level of enterotoxigenic E. coli O157:H7 on
carcasses and hides and in feces. The stx1 gene was of high prevalence
among hides isolates (68%, n=13) followed by carcass isolates (64%,
n=9) and ﬁnally feces isolates (47%, n=8). Again and in the same
meaning the stx2 gene was the highest one (15.8%, n=3) among hide
isolates followed by feces (11.8%, n=2) and the carcass (7%, n=1) iso-
lates. On the other hand, both stx1 and stx2 genes were of high preva-
lence in feces isolates (29.4%, n=5) followed by carcass (28.5%, n=4)
and hide isolates (10.5%, n=2).

3.4. Distribution of toxigenic E. coli O157:H7 in feces and on hide and
carcass samples

Out of the 14 positive carcasses-animal for E. coli O157:H7, 2
composite samples were only carcass positive; 5 composite samples
were positive for both carcasses and hides; 2 composite samples were
positive for carcasses and feces and ﬁnally 5 composite samples were
positive for carcass, hide and feces simultaneously. In the same meaning
out of 18 positive hide-animal, 6 composite samples were only hide
positive, 5 composite samples were positive for hides and carcasses; 2
composite samples were positive for hides and feces and the other 5
composite samples were positive for hides, feces and carcasses simulta-
neously. On the other hand out of the 15 positive feces-animal, 6
composite samples were only positive for feces samples; 2 composite
samples were positive for both feces and hides; 2 composite samples
were positive for feces and carcasses and ﬁnally 5 composite samples
were positive for feces, hides and carcasses simultaneously (Table 4).

3.2. Serotype conﬁrmation of E. coli O157:H7 using conventional PCR

3.5. Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents

All of the presumptive isolates (63 isolates) were subjected to PCR
analyses for serotype conﬁrmation. The results showed that 51 isolates
(80.9%) harbored rfbEO157 gene (O157) and only 50 isolates (79%)
contained both rfbEO157 and Flich7 genes (O157:H7). Accordingly, only
one isolate out of the 51 of the conﬁrmed serotype O157 did not harbor
the H7 gene. To compare latex agglutination data with PCR results, 51
out of the 63, O157 latex positive isolates were conﬁrmed as E. coli
O157 (83%), whereas 50 out of the 55 latex H7 positive were conﬁrmed
as E. coli O157:H7 (91%). The overall prevalence of PCR conﬁrmed E. coli
O157:H7 in feces and on hide and carcass samples was 17 (9.4%), 19
(10.6%), and 14 (7.8%), respectively (Table 2).

None of the 40 E. coli O157:H7 isolates were resistant to ampicillin,
ciproﬂoxacin or tetracycline, whereas all were resistant to erythromy-
cin, doxycycline, vancomycin and, neomycin. 50% of the isolates were
resistant to three antibiotics namely erythromycin, vancomycin and
neomycin. 10 out of 40 (25%) of the isolates were multi-resistant to
four antibiotics namely erythromycin, vancomycin, doxycycline and
neomycin, and another 10 (25%) were multi-resistant to other four dif-
ferent patterns (erythromycin, vancomycin, neomycin and streptomy-
cin). On the other hand, 2 out of 40 (5%) isolates were multi-resistant
to ﬁve antibiotics namely erythromycin, vancomycin, doxycycline, neo-
mycin and streptomycin (Table 5).

The prevalence rates of E. coli O157:H7 (9.4%, 10.6% and 7.8%) or
toxigenic E. coli O157:H7 (8.3%, 10% and 7.8%) in feces and on hide
and carcass samples are within the rates reported in literature. The
prevalence rate of E. coli O157:H7 in feces samples has been reported
in the range of 2.4 to 24% (Alam & Zurek, 2006; Alonso et al., 2007;
Jacob et al., 2011; McEvoy et al., 2003). The prevalence rate of E. coli
O157:H7 on hide and carcass samples has been reported in the
range of 11 to 76 % (Arthur et al., 2004; Elder et al., 2000) and 0.2
to 26.7 % (Alonso et al., 2007; Barkocy-Gallagher et al., 2003; FSIS,
1994; McEvoy et al., 2003; Vanderlinde et al., 1998), respectively.
The low prevalence rates of E. coli O157:H7 reported in this study
compared with those reported in the previously mentioned studies
may be related to differences in methodology of sampling. However,
the prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 on beef carcasses was higher in
the current study than that in a number of published studies. In the
United States, the prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 on beef carcasses
after dressing was determined to be 0.2% (FSIS, 1994). Two studies
that were conducted in the United Kingdom have reported that
0.47% and 1.4% of carcasses were contaminated with E. coli O157:H7
(Chapman, Cerdán Malo, Ellin, Ashton, & Harkin, 2001; Richards et
al., 1998). But, a study in northern Italy found that 12 out of 100
(12%) carcasses sampled were contaminated with E. coli O157:H7
(Bonardi, Maggi, Pizzin, Morabito, & Caprioli, 2001). The higher isola-
tion rate (7.8%) observed for E. coli O157:H7 on carcasses in this study
might be related to the absence of antimicrobial interventions through
dressing processes at abattoirs level or due to cross contamination
during the slaughter process which in overall reﬂect the general
unhygienic conditions in employees, utensils and environmental sani-
tation of the slaughter house under study.

The contamination levels of feces, hides and carcasses are closely re-
lated. This seems to be quite logical as the main source of contamination
is the fecal material which found its way to animal external surface due
to poor hygienic conditions during slaughtering process of the animals.
Contamination of carcasses with E. coli O157:H7 can occur when gut
contents, fecal matter or contaminated hides come in contact with
meat surfaces. These observations come in close agreement with other
ﬁndings in that a signiﬁcant correlation does exist between the preva-
lence of E. coli O157 in feces and on hides and carcasses (Bonardi et al.,
2001; Elder et al., 2000). The distribution of E. coli O157:H7 among
hides and carcasses depends mainly on level of hygienic precautions
taken during slaughtering to avoid cross contamination during hide

removal, evisceration and carcass dressing. This could be shown when
six animals revealed the presence of E. coli O157:H7 from intestinal
contents but not from either hide or carcasses (Table 4). Therefore, the
main sources of possible carcass contamination in abattoir are both
of hide and fecal contents. However, possible cross contamination
from utensils and employers is not to be neglected. This might be appar-
ent from following observation recorded in this study, where in two
cases the pathogen was recovered from carcasses only, but not from
hides or feces. Pathogenicity of E. coli O 157:H7 is related to many viru-
lence factors like Shiga toxins, intimin and enterohemolysin (Nataro &
Kaper, 1998). In the present study, a total of 50 PCR identiﬁed isolates
from 540 animals were tested for virulence factor by multiplex PCR
procedure. Out of these, 47 toxigenic isolates (harbored stx1 and/or
stx2 genes) were conﬁrmed. 30 (64%) isolates harbored stx1; 6 (13%)
isolates harbored stx2; and 11(23%) isolates harbored both toxins. The
stx2 producing E. coli O157:H7 strains are more virulent than stx1 or
stx1 and stx2 producing strains (Donnenberg, 2002), and being more
often linked with human disease problems (Boerling et al., 1999).

Similar to our study, non- pathogenic E. coli O 157:H7 strains
(without toxins factors) have also been identiﬁed from feces or beef
carcass (Guyon et al., 2001; Rogerie et al., 2001).

Cagney et al. (2004) studied the prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in
ground beef and beef burger (n=1533) from supermarkets and butcher
shops. In all of the 43 isolates, eaeA, hlyA and ﬂiCh7 genes were detected
and in 41 isolates stx1 and stx2 genes were determined. The presence of
the two (eaeA and hlyA) virulence factors comes in agreement with the
isolates identiﬁed in our study, though ﬂiCh7 genes were only present in
91% of our isolates. The toxigenicity percentage among all isolates (95%)
was in close agreement with the 94% reported in our study. In another
study on ground beef in Turkey, Sarimehmetoglu et al. (2009) identiﬁed
2 E. coli O157:H7 isolates. Both isolates have eaeA, hlyA and ﬂicH7 genes,
one of the isolates has stx1 and the other one has stx2 only. Whereas,
Vernozy-Rozand et al. (2002) recovered 4 E. coli O157:H7 from the
3450 ground beef samples in France and all the strains had both stx1
and stx2. Therefore, it appears that the distribution of stxs in isolates
might be different from food to other or from different geographical
locations.

Antimicrobial resistance may arise either spontaneously by selective
pressure or due to antimicrobial misuse by humans or overuse in
feeding or treatment of beef cattle by farmers (Schroeder et al., 2002).
Resistance development also might be related to exchange of resistance
factors between related bacteria (Tenover, 2006). The resistance of E. coli
O157:H7 to both erythromycin and vancomycin also comes in agree-
ment with the results of Harakeh et al. (2005). The results of the present
study indicated that E. coli O157:H7 were susceptible to gentamicin and
ciproﬂoxacin, which comes in agreement with a local Jordanian study on
isolates from sheep and goat (Tarawneh et al., 2008) and other studies in
the United States on isolates from human, cattle, swine and food
(Harakeh et al., 2005; Schroeder et al., 2002). In the present study all
E. coli O157:H7 tested were also susceptible to tetracycline which
again comes in parallel with the results of Dontorou et al. (2003) on
three isolates obtained from ewes' milk, fresh sausages and swine intes-
tines in Greece. Whereas this observation contradicts Tarawneh et al.'s
(2008) report on local Jordanian isolates from sheep and goat. Ali,
Farooqui, Khan, Khan, and Kazmi (2010) showed that 15 out of 51

(29%) E. coli O157:H7 meat isolates in Pakistan were resistant to doxycy-
cline, which is quite highly lower than the 100% resistance reported in
the present study. The resistance patterns for our tested isolates for
kanamycin, streptomycin and ampicillin come on the same line with a
study in Japan where 15 isolates (16.9%) of enterohemorrhagic E. coli
O157:H7 isolates obtained from diarrhea patients, were resistant to am-
picillin, kanamycin or streptomycin (Miwa et al., 2002). Our observation
for ampicillin susceptibility disagreed with other local studies on E. coli
O157:H7 isolates from sheep and goat (Tarawneh et al., 2008). Once
more, all tested E. coli O157:H7 were resistant to neomycin, which also
comes in accordance with Nizza et al. (2010), as 100% of tested isolates
from buffalo calves with diarrhea in Italy were resistant to neomycin.

Multiple antimicrobial resistances in E. coli may arise from the spread
of genetic materials including integrons, transposons, and plasmids
(Zhao et al., 2001). The increasing developing multi-drug resistant
bacteria is signaling a serious alarm from treatment point of view or the
possible transforming of resistance genes to other related pathogens
(Okeke, Lamikanra, & Edelman, 1999). Multiple antimicrobial resistance
is a common phenomenon among E. coli O157:H7 isolates drawn from
different sources. Schroeder et al. (2002) in the USA, showed that 17%,
7.5%, 8%, 5%, 2% and 0.1% of the E. coli O157 isolates were resistant to
one, two, three, four, ﬁve and six drugs, respectively. Also, Zhao et al.
(2001) studied multiple resistance of isolates recovered from human,
animals and food in the USA. They found that out of the twenty nine
tested E. coli O157:H7, four isolates showed multiple resistance to ﬁve
antimicrobials: tetracycline ampicillin, streptomycin, kanamycin, and
sulfamethoxazole. Two isolates were from cattle, and two isolates were
from human and ground beef.

It is essential to keep up with isolate characteristics for any
global changes in isolate distribution and similarities and prevalence
of common virulence factors. Also, it is essential to track the resistance
pattern recorded globally to follow changes in antimicrobial sensitivity
patterns that may require a reassessment of zoonotic control strategy.
Monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in E. coli O157:H7 isolates is
valuable for epidemiological uses and for monitoring the increase of
antimicrobial resistance among different microbial species. Continuous
surveillance of emerging antimicrobial resistance among zoonotic
foodborne pathogens, including E. coli O157:H7 is required to ensure
global one inspiration public health.
