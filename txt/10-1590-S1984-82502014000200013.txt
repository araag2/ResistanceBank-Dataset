Food contamination caused by enteric pathogens is a major cause of diarrheal disease worldwide, 
resulting in high morbidity and mortality and significant economic losses. Bacteria are important agents 
of foodborne diseases, particularly diarrheagenic Escherichia coli. The present study assessed the genetic 
diversity and antimicrobial resistance of E. coli isolates from pasteurized milk processed in 21 dairies in 
northwestern State of Parana, Brazil. The 95 E. coli isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility 
testing according to the recommendations of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and assessed 
genotypically by Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus-Polymerase Chain Reaction (ERIC-
PCR). The highest rate of resistance was observed for cephalothin (55.78%). ERIC-PCR revealed high 
genetic diversity, clustering the 95 bacterial isolates into 90 different genotypic patterns. These results 
showed a heterogeneous population of E. coli in milk samples produced in the northwestern region of 
Paraná and the need for good manufacturing practices throughout the processing of pasteurized milk to 
reduce the risk of foodborne illnesses.

INTRODUCTION

Food contamination caused by enteric pathogens is 
a major cause of diarrheal disease worldwide, resulting 
in high morbidity and mortality and significant economic 
losses (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
2013). Bacteria are important agents of foodborne 
diseases (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
2013), particularly Escherichia coli, which is widely 
distributed in nature. Despite being commonly found in 
the gastrointestinal tract of humans and other animals, 
it can cause a variety of diseases, some of which are life 
threatening in more vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, 
children, and immunocompromised individuals (FDA, 
2012).

E. coli has been isolated from various foodstuffs, 
such as meat, vegetables, milk, and milk derivatives, 
which can serve as a vehicle for the transmission of 
diseases by food (Lee et al., 2009; Solomakos et al., 2009; 
Brooks et al., 2012; Maffei et al., 2013).

In Brazil, some studies have reported a high 
prevalence of E. coli in raw and pasteurized milk. E. coli 
was isolated from 41.1% of pasteurized milk samples 
evaluated by Silva et al. (2001), while in raw milk, this 
bacteria was found in 79,2% (Campos et al., 2006) and in 
76% (Barreto et al., 2012) of milk samples analyzed. An 
important subject is the emergence of resistant foodborne 
pathogens that may be transmitted to humans as food 
contaminants. Outbreaks of foodborne diseases that 
involve resistant bacteria associated with food animal 
sources have been reported (Safe Food, 2010).

Milk may get contaminated with E. coli from 
various sources during different stages of production and 
processing, which could explain the genetic diversity 
of these bacteria in milk. The presence of E. coli in 
pasteurized milk may be due to inadequate pasteurization 
or contamination of the product after pasteurization 
process. Studies of the epidemiology of foodborne 
microorganisms, especially the source of contamination, 
have been conducted using various molecular techniques, 
such as ribotyping, multilocus sequence typing, randomly 
amplified polymorphic DNA, enterobacterial repetitive 
intergenic consensus-polymerase chain reaction, 
repetitive extragenic palindromic, and pulsed-field gel 
electrophoresis (Foley, Lynne, Nayak, 2009).

Several studies have used ERIC-PCR to assess the 
genetic similarity of E. coli isolates from different sources. 
Rantsiou, Alessandria and Cocolin (2012) assessed the 
genetic diversity of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli from 
meat and dairy products using ERIC-PCR. Wenz et 
al. (2006) described genetic variability among E. coli 

isolates from dairy cattle with mastitis using ERIC-PCR. 
Ibenyassine et al. (2006) used the same technique and 
evaluated the similarity of isolates from plants infected 
by irrigation water. Other authors have used ERIC-PCR to 
compare E. coli isolates from humans and animals (Leung 
et al., 2004; Sabate et al., 2008; Tramuta et al., 2011; De la 
Fé Rodriguez et al., 2012). Moreover, Casarez, Pillai, Di 
Giovanni, (2007), Duan et al. (2009), and Wan et al. (2011) 
showed that ERIC-PCR could discriminate E. coli from 
water and environmental samples. Knowledge about the 
epidemiology of diarrheagenic E. coli in food is important 
for understanding its distribution and transmission, besides 
developing and implementing control measures in food 
production.

To the best of our knowledge, no studies have 
used ERIC-PCR to assess the diversity of E. coli in 
pasteurized, ready-to-consume cow milk. Thus, the aim of 
the present study was to evaluate the genetic diversity and 
antimicrobial resistance of E. coli isolates from cow milk 
pasteurized in the northwestern region of Paraná, Brazil, 
using ERIC-PCR.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Bacterial isolates

Ninety-five E. coli isolates from pasteurized, 
ready-to-consume cow milk samples were analyzed. The 
isolates were stored in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB; Difco, Le 
Pont de Claix, France) with glycerol at -20 ºC and kept 
at the Laboratory of Food Microbiology, Department 
of Clinical Analysis and Biomedicine, Maringá State 
University. The milk samples were obtained from 21 
dairies in Paraná, Brazil, from March 2006 to November 
2008 in a previous study conducted in our laboratory that 
evaluated the presence of coliforms in pasteurized milk 
(Zanella et al., 2010). The different dairies were identified 
by the abbreviations AA, APRO, CAIUÁ, CC, CIA, COC, 
COOP, GM, L, LAC, LOU, MOU, MP, NE, P, PN, S, SN, 
SO, TB, and U.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed 
using the disc diffusion technique according to the 
method described by the Clinical and Laboratory 
Standards Institute (2009). The antimicrobial agents 
(Oxoid, Hampshire, England) were the following: 
amikacin (30μg), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (10-20 
μg), ampicillin (10 μg), aztreonam (30 μg), cephalothin 
(30 μg), cefepime (30 μg), cefotaxime (30 μg), cefoxitin 

K. Oltramari, R. F. Cardoso, E. V. Patussi, A. C. B. Santos, J. M. G. Mikcha(30 μg), ceftazidime (30 μg), ciprofloxacin (5 μg), 
chloramphenicol (30 μg), gentamycin (10 μg), imipenem 
(10 μg), sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim (1.25-23.75 
μg), tetracycline (30 μg), and tobramycin (10 μg). The E. 
coli ATCC 25922 and E. coli ATCC 35218 isolates were 
used as controls.

ERIC-PCR

Genomic DNA of E. coli isolates was extracted from 
overnight bacterial growth on Nutrient Agar (Difco, Le 
Pont de Claix, France; Swanenburg et al., 1998). DNA 
quantification was performed using NanoDrop 2000.

The amplification reaction was performed by 
adding 100 ng of bacterial DNA to a PCR reagent 
mixture that contained 1 µM of the primers ERIC1R 
(5’-ATGTAAGCTCCTGGGGATTCAC-3’) and ERIC2 
(5’-AAGTAAGTGACTGGGGTGAGCG-3’; (Versalovic, 
Koeuth, Lupski, 1991), PCR buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 
pH 8.4, 50 mM KCl), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 µM of each 
nucleotide (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP), 1 U of DNA 
polymerase (Taq DNA polymerase; Invitrogen -Life 
Technologies, Brazil), and sterile deionized water to a 
final volume of 25 µl. The amplification was performed 
in a thermocycler (Gene Amp PCR System 2400, Perkin 
Elmer, Roche, Branchburg, NJ, USA) with denaturing at 
94 ºC for 7 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94 ºC for 30 s, 
52 ºC for 1min, and 72 ºC for 8 min and a final extension 
at 72 ºC for 16min. The PCR product underwent 1.5% 
agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, 
Sweden) gel electrophoresis at 7-10 V/cm2 for 2 h and 
visualized under UV light. The spectral band analysis 
was performed using BioNumerics software (version 
4.45, Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium). The 
Dendrogram was constructed using the Dice coefficient, 
and the phylogenetic distance was determined using the 
Unweighted Pair Group Method with the Arithmetic Mean 
algorithm. Isolates with ≥95% similarity were considered 
closely related. The discriminatory power of ERIC-PCR 
was calculated based on Simpson’s diversity index as 
indicated by Hunter and Gaston (1988). 

RESULTS

All 95 E. coli isolates were found to be susceptible 
to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, aztreonam, cefepime, 
cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamycin, 
imipenem, and tobramycin. Sixty-two isolates (65.26%) 
were resistant to at least one of the antimicrobial 
agents tested. Among the resistant isolates, five were 
simultaneously resistant to three antimicrobial agents.

The highest rates of resistance were observed for 
cephalothin (55.78%) and ampicillin (26.31%). Resistance 
to cefoxitin (5.26%), tetracycline (3.15%), amikacin 
(2.10%), chloramphenicol (2.10%), and trimethoprim-
sulphamethoxazole (1.05%) was also observed. The E. 
coli isolates were grouped into 11 resistance profiles. The 
most common resistance profiles were to cephalothin (30 
isolates) and cephalothin/ampicillin (14 isolates; Figure 1).

ERIC-PCR applied to 95 E. coli isolates generated 
patterns of four to 20 bands, with sizes that ranged from 
100 to 2,000 bp. Considering the similarity level ≥95%, 90 
ERIC-PCR patterns were observed. Of these, 85 (89.47%) 
showed unique profiles, and the remaining 10 (10.53%) 
were included in five clusters, comprising two isolates 
each (isolates 14 GM and 16 GM, 14 CC and 15 CC, 6 
MP and 10 MP, 10 COC and 11 COC, and 12 L and 14 L; 
Figure 2).

The clusters 1, 2, 4, and 5, that contained two isolates 
each, clustered isolates from four milk samples processed 
in four distinct dairies. Distinct antimicrobial resistance 
profiles between each of two clustered isolates were 
observed. Cluster 3 contained two isolates (6 MP and 10 
MP) that were resistant to cephalothin and were obtained 
from different pasteurized milk samples in the same dairy 
(Figure 2). None of the clusters was obtained from milk 
samples processed in different dairies. The discriminatory 
index of ERIC-PCR was 0.999.

DISCUSSION

Pathogenic microorganisms have been isolated 
from milk and dairy products (D’Amico, Donnelly, 2010; 

Genetic heterogeneity of Escherichia coli isolated from pasteurized milk in State of Paraná, Brazil340

coli isolated from pasteurized cow milk in State of Paraná, Brazil.

K. Oltramari, R. F. Cardoso, E. V. Patussi, A. C. B. Santos, J. M. G. MikchaCosta Sobrinho et al., 2012). Among them, diarrheagenic 
E. coli is notable and can cause diseases with serious 
consequences, especially in children and the elderly (FDA, 
2012). The analysis and comparison of E. coli isolates 
from different sources can generate important information 
about the origin and transmission of these bacteria (Foley, 
Lynne, Nayak, 2009).

Importantly, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria can 
act as reservoirs of resistance genes. Several studies of 
bacteria isolated from food have shown resistance to one 
or more antimicrobials, which is worrying because these 
microorganisms can be spread in the population as food 
contaminants (Lutgen et al., 2009; Solomakos et al., 2009; 
Dutil et al., 2010; Rahimi, Chaleshtori, Parsaei, 2010).

In the present study, 65.26% of the isolates showed 
resistance to at least one of the antimicrobial agents tested. 
Similar results were reported by Rahimi, Chaleshtori and 
Parsaei (2010), who found that 88.9% of the isolates were 
resistant to one or more of the tested antimicrobials. The 
highest rates of resistance were observed for cephalothin 
(55.78%) and ampicillin (26.31%). Paneto et al. (2007) 
evaluated E. coli isolated from cheese and provided indices 
of resistance to ampicillin and cephalothin that were 
similar to those observed in the present study. Rahimi, 
Chaleshtori and Parsaei, (2010) found that 44.4% of the 
E. coli isolates from dairy products showed ampicillin 
resistance. Solomakos et al. (2009) found that all of the 
E. coli isolates from milk were resistant to ampicillin, 
whereas Campos et al. (2006) found increased resistance 
to ampicillin and cephalothin and resistance to tetracycline 
in E. coli isolated from milk and cheese.

With regard to resistance profiles, the E. coli isolates 
were differentiated into 11 profiles. Heterogeneous profiles 
of antimicrobial resistance were also described by Rangel 
and Marin (2009) and Solomakos et al. (2009) in E. coli 
isolated from milk.

In the present study, ERIC-PCR showed high 
genetic diversity among the 95 E. coli isolates, which were 
clustered into 90 profiles. Among the clusters generated by 
ERIC-PCR, eight clustered E. coli isolates from four milk 
samples processed in four different dairies, suggesting 
a single clone contaminant per milk sample (Figure 2). 
Nevertheless, one cluster that comprised two E. coli 
isolates from different milk samples processed in the same 
dairy could suggest a common source of contamination. 
These results indicate failures in pasteurization process 
or contamination in post-pasteurization processing and 
show the need for control measures to minimize E. coli 
contamination. The present results are consistent with 
Wenz et al. (2006), who studied E. coli isolates from 
dairy cattle with mastitis, and Rantsiou, Alessandria and 

341

Cocolin (2012), who used ERIC-PCR to assess the genetic 
similarity of E. coli isolated from meat products and 
unpasteurized dairy products. E. coli is widely distributed 
in nature, and the sources of milk contamination can be 
diverse, explaining the high genotypic diversity observed 
in the present study.

ERIC-PCR is effective in typing E. coli isolates 
from animals (Mohapatra, Broersma, Mazumder, 2007; 
Prabu et al., 2010; Wan et al., 2011; De la Fé Rodriguez et 
al., 2012) and water (Casarez, Pillai, Di Giovanni, 2007). 
However, some reports indicated that ERIC-PCR is not 
effective in typing E. coli isolated from humans, animals, 
and food (Giammanco et al., 2002; Leung et al., 2004; 
Costa et al., 2006).

The present study showed heterogeneous profiles 
of antimicrobial resistance and a high genotypic diversity 
using ERIC-PCR in E. coli isolated from dairy milk 
processed in northwestern Paraná. The high genetic 
diversity observed in the present study can be justified by 
several sources of contamination of cow milk by E. coli 
during the entire production process.
