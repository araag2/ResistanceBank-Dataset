Abstract

Aim: To evaluate the hygienic quality of raw chicken meat and raw milk sold in the local markets of Patna with reference to 
isolation of Salmonella and antibiotic resistance pattern of Salmonella against commonly used antibiotics.
Materials and Methods: A total of 370 samples comprising of 228 chicken meat and 142 market milk samples were 
processed for isolation and serotyping, supplemented with molecular detection of isolates targeting invA gene of Salmonella. 
All the isolates were tested against commonly used antibiotics (13 nos). 
Results:  Out  of  370  samples,  23.7%  (54/228)  chicken  meat  and  7.7%  (11/142)  milk  samples  were  found  positive  for 
Salmonella  based  on  biochemical  reactions.  The  serotyping  of  Salmonella  isolates  showed  an  incidence  of  6.1%  of 
Salmonella typhimurium, 2.6% of S. newport, 1.7% of S. gallinarum and 0.4% each of S. enteritidis, S. infantis and S. 
worthington in chicken meat; and 2.1% of S. typhimurium and 1.4% of S. newport in market milk samples. Polymerase chain 
reaction targeting invA gene showed positive presence of Salmonella in 18.42% chicken meat and 5.6% market milk samples.
Conclusion: The antibiotic susceptibility test revealed the presence of multiple drug resistant Salmonella in chicken meat and 
milk. The present study indicates high prevalence of Salmonella in raw chicken meat and milk due to poor hygienic practices 
and therefore emphasizes the need for adopting these hygienic practices.      
Keywords: antibiotic resistance, invA , Salmonella, serotypes.

Introduction

Salmonella [7]. Amplification of invA gene of Salmonella 
has been reported as a suitable target for PCR ampli-
fication,  with  potential  diagnostic  applications  [8]. 
Emergence of multidrug-resistant S. enterica serovars 
has  been  increasing  and  has  become  a  major  health 
concern  [1].  One  of  the  contributing  factors  for  the 
widespread dissemination of multi drug resistant bacteria 
has  been  the  indiscriminate  prophylactic  and  thera-
peutic use of antimicrobial agents in food animals [9]. 

Therefore the present study was aimed to study 
the prevalence of Salmonella and also characterize the 
distribution of the drug resistant pathogen in chicken 

Salmonella enterica is a leading cause of enteric 
diseases in humans and animals with millions of illness 
reported  worldwide.  The  nontyphoidal  Salmonella 
serovars  are  predominantly  associated  with  food  of 
animal origin such as eggs, milk, poultry, beef and pork 
meat responsible for zoonotic transmission [1, 2]. The 
incidence of salmonellosis has been reported in many 
developing  countries  including  India,  Egypt,  Brazil 
and Zimbabwe [3]. S. enterica serovar Typhimurium 
and  S.  enterica  serovar  Enteritidis  are  the  most 
frequently  encountered  species  from  foods  like  meat and market milk of Patna, India.
poultry,  pork  and  beef  products  [4].  Incidence  of 
Salmonella in chicken meat and milk has been reported 
by  several  workers  using  different  methods  and  the 
frequency of detection ranges from 6.79% to 97.6% [5] 
in chicken meat and 0.17% to 28.6% [6] in raw milk. 
Although,  isolation  of  Salmonella  by  growth  in  a 
culture medium followed by serotyping is considered 
as the gold standard for confirmation of Salmonella, it 
is also time consuming and labour intensive. 

Materials and Methods
Sample  collection:  A  simple  random  method  was 
adopted to collect a total of 370 samples constituting 
fresh  chicken  meat  (n=228)  and  milk  (n=142)  from 
different vendors of Patna, Bihar between September, 
2010 to March, 2013. The samples were maintained on 
ice, transported to the laboratory and processed within 
1 hr of collection. 
Isolation  and  biochemical  characterization:  Ten 
grams of chicken meat and 0.5 ml of milk samples were 
used  for  pre-enrichment  in  buffered  peptone  water 
(BPW), at 37 °C for 18 hrs. One ml of pre-enriched 
broth was transferred into Selenite Cystine broth and 

Therefore techniques like PCR are increasingly 
being  used  for  rapid  detection  and  confirmation  of

which  is  a  higher  distribution  than  that  showed  by 
serotyping  of  isolates. The  PCR  assay  also  detected 
some of the isolates which had originally been detected 
as negative in serotyping study. This is in concordance 
with the finding of Hamza [20]. This may be attributed 
to the presence of rough mutant strains which lack the 
specific side chains responsible for 'O' specificity or 
some  additional  abnormalities  of  the  core  structure 
[21] resulting in negative result in serotyping. Hence, 
the study recommends that PCR may be used for rapid 
and sensitive detection of Salmonella supported by the 
findings of Wang et al [7]. 

The  study  concluded  that  non  typhoidal 
Salmonella  serotypes  are  prevailing  in  the  poultry 
carcasses  and  milk  and  therefore  act  as  a  source  of 
human  infection.  The  level  of  prevalence  can  be 
reduced by adopting hygienic practices during poultry 
slaughter.  The  presence  of  multiple  resistance  in 
Salmonella isolates suggested that there is appreciable 
risk  of  infection  to  humans  with  multidrug  resistant 
Salmonella from consumption of unpasteurized milk 
and undercooked chicken meat.

Since food of poultry origin and milk are some of 
the most common sources of human salmonellosis, the 
findings from this report may be correlated with the 
hygienic practices to reduce public health problem in
