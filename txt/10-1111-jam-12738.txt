Aim: The aim of
co-grazing with cattle and wild life constitutes a risk of
antibiotic resistant bacteria to wild ungulates.
Methods and Results: Faecal samples were collected from buffalo (n = 35),
wildebeest (n = 40), zebra (n = 40) and cattle (N = 20) from Mikumi National
Park, Tanzania (MNP), where cattle is prohibited and from Ngorongoro
Conservation Area (NCA) where co-grazing is practiced. The number of
coliforms and enterococci resistant to selected antibiotics was determined. Wild
life generally harboured higher number of
resistant Escherichia coli and
Enterococci than cattle, but with no general inﬂuence in wild life of co-grazing
with cattle. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci were detected in wild life
samples, and E. coli resistant to cefotaxime and enroﬂoxacin were observed
among isolates from all wild life, but not from cattle. Culture independent
estimates of the number of sulII gene copies obtained by qPCR did not differ
between wild life from the two sample sites, while tetW was signiﬁcantly higher
in samples from MPN than from NCA.
Conclusions: Antibiotic resistant bacteria were not more frequently found in
ungulates grazing together with cattle than ungulates without this interaction.

Introduction

Wild life animals often carry antibiotic resistant bacteria.
For example, healthy wild scavenging birds such as sea-
gulls (Radhouani et al. 2009) and birds of prey such as
buzzards (Radhouani et al. 2012) have been found to
carry high numbers of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the
absence of any known contact with antibiotics. Such bac-
teria are believed to originate in humans and domesti-
cated animals (Skurnik et al. 2006), and they form an
indirect proof of
transmission of either the resistant

resistance

transfer of

bacteria or horizontal
genes.
Increased human activities within the habitats of wild
animals increases the risk of interspecies disease transmis-
sion, and areas of high human density or intense research
and ecotourism activities expose wildlife to a high risk of
disease spillover from humans and livestock (Benavides
et al. 2012).

Tanzania has a high number of wildlife animals, and
wild life tourism constitutes an important part of the
economy. The animals are located in 15 national parks as
well as conservation areas, such as the famous Ngorongoro

Antimicrobial resistance in wild ungulates

Conservation Area (NCA). The latter is Tanzania’s most
visited protected area, and in addition it is a multiple
land-use zone inhabited not only by the wild life but also
by the pastoral Massai people keeping Tanzania Short
Horned Zebu cattle in high numbers. Within NCA the
main wild ungulates, wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus),
zebra (Equus burchelli) and buffalo (Syncerus caffer), inter-
act with Massai people and their cattle in the grazing land
and at water points (Voeten and Prins 1999; Charnley
2005). While antibiotic resistance has been described in
African wild primates (Rolland et al. 1985), mountain
gorillas (Rwego et al. 2008), wild boars (Literak et al.
2009) and mongoose (Pesapane et al. 2013), there is lim-
ited information available on the levels of antibiotic resis-
tance from wild ungulates, and in particular how this is
inﬂuenced by sharing grazing land with domesticated
animals and the general environment with the pastoral
people.

Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. are normal inhab-
itants of the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and most
animal species (Lester et al. 2006), and they are good
indicators of
local selection pressures (Aarestrup 1999;
Byarugaba et al. 2011). The aim of this study was to
determine whether co-grazing with cattle inﬂuences anti-
microbial resistance in E. coli and Enterococcus spp. from
faecal samples of wild ungulates. This was assessed by
comparing resistance levels in faecal samples from three
wild animal species from NCA with interaction with cat-
tle with levels in faecal samples in the same species of
animals from the Mikumi National Park (MNP), where
cattle are strictly prohibited to graze, and where wild ani-
mals have little interaction with humans.

and buffalo. Masai people graze cattle in high numbers
within this area; a 2013 census estimated 136 500 cattle
and 292 000 small ruminants. MNP is the fourth-largest
park in Tanzania, and part of a much larger ecosystem
centred on the uniquely vast Selous Game Reserve
(TANAPA, 2013). It has a wild life population of large
animals of c. 15 000 heads (Marttila 2011), including the
three species investigated in the current study. Cattle are
prohibited within the borders of this park.

Sample sources and sampling
One freshly voided faecal sample (3–5 g) was collected
from each buffalo (NCA n = 15: MNP n = 20), wilde-
beest (NCA n = 20; MNP n = 20), zebra (NCA n = 20;
MNP n = 20) and zebu cattle (NCA n = 20). All samples
in NCA were collected on 1 day in the month of
November 2010 and all samples in MNP on 1 day Octo-
ber 2011. One-day sampling was chosen to avoid sam-
pling the same animal more than one time. Wild life
and cattle were tracked on foot until defecation was
observed. Samples from buffalo, zebra and cattle, which
defecate voluminous, were collected from the inside of
the dung using plastic gloves. Dung from wildebeest is
small, and here the majority of the dung was used, how-
ever,
that had
touched ground. After collection, samples were stored in
sterile containers in the cooling box with ice at c. 4°C
and transported to a local laboratory for analysis on the
day of collection.

One or two colonies of E. coli and enterococci with typical
colony morphology from each plate were sub-cultured in
order to get pure cultures. These cultures were stored at
 80°C until further analysis. Species identiﬁcation of lac-
tose positive colonies from MacConkey agar was per-
formed using Gram stain and the IMViC phenotypic tests
(indole, methyl red, Voges Proskauer and citrate) using

standard procedures. Presumptive Enterococcus colonies
were species identiﬁed by multiplex PCR according to Du-
tka-Malen et al. (1995). Matrix-assisted laser desorption-
ionization time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF
MS) (Vitek MS RUO, bioMerieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France)
was used to identify isolates that did not show typical reac-
tions in the biochemical tests or by multiplex PCR.

similar in wild life and cattle (Table S1). Comparing data
from wild life in the two parks, counts of AMP-resistant
coliforms were signiﬁcantly higher in wild life samples
from NCA compared to wild life samples from MNP.
Counts of CTX-resistant coliforms were signiﬁcantly
higher in samples from MNP. One or two colonies were
isolated from all samples (N = 24) that showed growth
on the CTX plates. All resistant isolates showed synergy
with clavulanic acid in ESBL test, indicating presumptive
ESBL isolates.

There was no signiﬁcant difference in tetracycline resis-
tance in wild life between the two study sites, while
counts of
sulphamethoxazole-resistant bacteria were
higher in samples from MNP. The average total number
of coliforms in wild life from MNP was signiﬁcantly
higher than the number of coliforms in wild life from
NCA.

while a total of 10 wild life animals carried VRE and

(Table 2). The VRE were
found in one buffalo, eight zebras and one wildebeest,
and was shown to belong to Ent. faecium, Enterococcus
faecalis and Enterococcus hirae. Though on average the
level of resistance to these antibiotics was low in entero-
cocci, the counts of AMP-resistant Enterococcus spp. were
found to be signiﬁcantly higher (P < 005) in samples
from MNP compared to NCA.

(75%), Enterococcus

belonged to Ent. faecium, and the rest
included Ent.

and
Ent. hirae (75%). Ent. gallinarum was found in Wilde-
beest and Zebra, and Ent. hirae was found in all wild un-
gulates, but not in cattle. No signiﬁcant difference in
species composition was observed between animals from
NCA and MNP (data not shown).

Antibiotic susceptibility of Escherichia coli and
Enterococcus spp.

Wild life isolates of E. coli from MNP were more fre-
quently resistant to tetracycline (P = 003), gentamicin
(P < 0001) and enroﬂoxacin (P < 00001) than isolates
from NCA (Table 4). Signiﬁcant differences were also
observed between animal species, for example AMP resis-
tance was signiﬁcantly more common in isolates obtained
from buffalo than the other species investigated. Notably,
E. coli resistant to CTX and enroﬂoxacin were observed
among isolates from all wild life, but not from cattle.
Colonies showing resistance to CTX all showed synergy
with clavulanic acid, indicating that a gene of the ESBL-
group encoded the resistance.

Enterococci from wild life animals in NCA and MNP
only differed with respect to sulpha-trimethoprim resis-
tance with isolates from NCA showing the highest preva-
lence (Table 5). Contrary to E. coli isolates, there was no
signiﬁcant difference in resistance level between animal
species.

Quantiﬁcation of resistance genes tetW and sulII

The value of
indicator bacteria relies heavily on the
assumption that bacteria compared from different ani-
mals belong to the same species. To ensure that this was
the case before isolated colonies were characterized by
disc diffusion assay, 120 presumptive E. coli and 120 pre-
sumptive Enterococcus spp. were randomly selected and
identiﬁed to the species level. All lactose positive colonies
selected from MacConkey agar were demonstrated to be
E. coli. The species distribution of the Enterococcus iso-
lates is shown in Table 3. Of the 120 isolates, 95 (792%)

To investigate whether differences observed above were a
reﬂection of inherent overall differences in resistance lev-
els in the total intestinal ﬂora, two antibiotic resistance
genes were selected and quantiﬁed by qPCR, i.e. a cul-
ture independent approach. The copy number of sulII
genes did not differ in wild life between the two loca-
tions and did not differ between animal species, whether
this was expressed as absolute numbers or as a propor-
tion of 16s rRNA copy number (Table 6). In contrast,
animals from NCA had a higher number of tetW genes

Discussion

Wild animals, particularly species that live in close associ-
ation with humans, may be exposed to resistant bacteria
in their environment, and antimicrobial resistance has
been detected in faecal bacteria from a variety of wild
animals,
including birds, reptiles, mammals and ﬁsh,
throughout the world (Rolland et al. 1985; Sayah et al.
2005; Jardine et al. 2012). In the current study, a quit
high numbers of antimicrobial
resistant E. coli and
Enterococcus spp. strains were observed from some free-
ranging buffalo, zebra and wildebeest. Included in this
was E. coli
showing resistance to cephalosporin, and
showing synergy with clavulanic acid, which is the classi-
cal test for ESBL production. Further studies are indi-
cated to elucidate which ESBL genes are carried by these
isolates. Also the study demonstrated the presence in wild
life of ﬂouroquinolone resistant E. coli, and enterococci
with resistance to VA or AMP.

Our observations cannot be explained by direct expo-
sure to antibiotics, as the wild life authorities maintain a
strict policy of none interference with wild life. Co-habi-
tation with livestock in grazing and drinking water points
was therefore hypothesized to be a contributing factor,
and we designed this study to investigate whether such
interaction was a risk factor for carriage of antibiotic
resistant bacteria in wild life. We did not observe a gen-
eral higher level of antibiotic resistant bacteria in wild life
from NCA, where such interaction is taking place, com-
pared to MNP where wild life does not interact with cat-
tle. The results suggested that the practice of co-grazing
did not results in frequent transmission of resistant bacte-
ria or resistance genes from livestock to wild life ungu-
lates, however, a larger study with more samples will be
required to quantify the risk. One possible confounding
factor is that in years with drought, animals in MNP may
move out of the park boundaries where they may get in
contact with livestock and humans. Bacteria obtained
during grazing under these conditions may persist in the
intestine and be a reason for the presence of resistance.

Taken to its full consequences, the observation of low
transmission of resistant bacteria may indicate that dis-
ease transmission between cattle and wild life may not be
a major problem for disease-causing agents that require
faecal-oral transmission, unless the infective dose is very
low. However, the sensitivity of the sampling used in the
current investigation was low, and further studies are
indicated.

A possible explanation for the presence of antimicro-
bial resistant bacteria in Buffalo and Zebra is the behav-
iour of these animals. As has been reported for baboons
(Rolland et al. 1985), they are frequently found in close
proximity of staff houses, ofﬁces and lodges. It is possible
that they come in contact with human refuse or even
human excretes. Wildebeest on the other hand are much
more timid animals and are afraid of human interactions.
In NCA, Masai herders move with cattle and during this
time, access to toilets is limited. Frequently bushes are
used at time of urgency, and through this practice, wild
animals may come into contact with human faeces. In
MNP, however, such a situation does not exist. All pres-
ent lodges for tourists in the two parks have septic tanks
and soak pits. Flooding of septic tanks during raining
season can occur and lead to contamination of grazing
land, which may cause transfer of antibiotic resistant bac-
teria to the animals.

It is well known that colonization of the intestinal tract
by resistant bacteria can occur even in the absence of
selection pressures, particularly as a result of contact with
resistant bacteria in food or on environmental fomites
(Adesiyun and Downes 1999; Wright 2010). Antimicro-
bial resistant bacteria are also found in high numbers of
soil samples (Riesenfeld et al. 2004), and from here they
can be ingested during grazing and transfer their genes to
the bacteria we have investigated. We cannot rule out
that some of the resistance genes responsible for the phe-
notypes we have observed originate in soil bacteria.
Finally, there is a magnitude of ﬂying birds in both NCA
(over 500 species) and MNP (more than 400 species)
(TANAPA, 2013) and around natural and artiﬁcial

Antimicrobial resistance in wild ungulates

constructed water points, these come into contact with
mammals. Healthy wild scavenging birds have been found
often to carry high numbers of antibiotic resistant bacte-
ria (Radhouani et al. 2009, 2012). These birds could also
be responsible of spreading resistant bacteria from one
point to another (Adesiyun and Downes 1999).

Grazing behaviour of wild animals differ from that of
cattle. They cover a large area within the NCA compared
to that of cattle. They also cross the Tanzanian border
and interact with other wild animals and cattle in Kenyan
country. In this scenario, it is possible for wild animals to
feed on different vegetation (Ushimaru et al. 2007) and
get contact with more environments that have been con-
taminated by birds and animal faeces containing resistant
bacteria (Adesiyun and Downes 1999), and this may
explain our observations. A more theoretical explanation
is that plants rich in a variety of secondary metabolites,
such as tannins, terpenoids, alkaloids and ﬂavonoids may
select for antibiotic resistance, since they have been found
in vitro to have antimicrobial properties (Cowan 1999;
Lewis and Ausubel 2006), However, further studies are
needed to investigate whether they share resistance mech-
anisms with antibiotics.

Antibiotic resistant levels were found to be higher in
wild animals compared to cattle, even though these are
occasionally treated with antibiotics. A weakness of this
study is the lack of data on consumption of antibiotics in
these cattle. Such data do not exist and cannot be readily
obtained due to lack of records. A recent study on antibi-
otic use in Tanzania showed that cattle are generally trea-
ted with oxytetracycline and sulphonamides as the most
common drugs, and that use of cefalosporin and ﬂour-
oquinolones cannot be afforded by the poor cattle keep-
ers (Katakweba et al. 2012). Hence,
the presence of
indicator bacteria resistant to such drugs is more likely to
be caused by interaction with humans than with cattle.

Analogous to our investigation, Rwego et al. (2008)
conducted a study to see if habitat overlap can increase
the risks of anthroponotic and zoonotic pathogen trans-
mission between humans,
livestock, and wild apes and
found that contact with humans and/or livestock was
indeed a risk factor for transmission of bacteria. E. coli
were collected from humans,
livestock and mountain
gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) in Bwindi impenetrable
National Park, Uganda. Gorilla populations that over-
lapped at high rates with people and livestock in their
use of habitat harboured E. coli that was genetically simi-
lar to E. coli from those people and livestock. The strains
obtained from such animals were resistant to at least one
antibiotic used by local people, and the proportion of
individual gorillas harbouring resistant isolates declined
across populations
in proportion to the decreasing
degrees of habitat overlapping with humans. We have not

performed genetic ﬁngerprinting of the strains obtained
in this study, for the reason that too few colonies were
obtained from each animal; with so few isolates it is very
unlikely that we will detect genetically similar strains.

To investigate whether resistance levels in general dif-
fered between species and between the two groups of wild
animals, i.e. those grazing with and those grazing without
cattle, quantiﬁcation by culture independent qPCR was
performed for one common tetracycline resistance gene
and one sulphonamide resistance gene. qPCR has previ-
ously been used in several investigations to quantify levels
of resistance genes (Pei et al. 2006; Momtaz et al. 2012).
The chosen gene tetW is chromosomally encoded and
common in Gram positive bacteria (Scott et al. 1997). It
has also been shown to be common in cattle (Peak et al.
2007), and it is present in the human gut ﬂora (Scott
et al. 2000). sulII represents the most common sulphona-
mide resistance genes in E. coli from many species of ani-
mals and in man (Trobos et al. 2008). No signiﬁcant
increase in gene pools were associated with co-grazing
with cattle, supporting our observations from phenotypic
based analysis, but in contrast to that investigation, the
level of resistance (both expressed as absolute numbers of
genes and number of genes relative to 16s rRNA) was not
higher in wild life compared to cattle, suggesting that the
phenotypic tests highlight differences due to other genes
that the two investigated by qPCR.

In conclusion, the results of this study have demon-
strated presence of antibiotic resistant E. coli and entero-
cocci
in wildlife animals in the absence of antibiotic
pressure. Wild animals grazing together with cattle that
are actively treated with antibiotics did not generally
show higher levels of resistant bacteria than wild animals
not grazing with cattle. In the context of this study, this
indicates that co-grazing may not result in frequent trans-
mission of resistant bacteria.
