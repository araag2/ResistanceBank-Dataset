Abstract. The objective of the current study was to isolate and identify phenotypes of Staphylococcus spp. strains derived 
from buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) milk. A total of 548 milk samples from 137 buffalo were cultured in Columbia agar enriched 
with  5%  defibrinated  sheep  blood.  Determination  of  the  capacity  of  Staphylococcus  aureus  to  produce  enterotoxins A–D 
and  toxic  shock  syndrome  toxin-1  (TSST-1)  was  achieved  by  reverse  passive  latex  agglutination  (RPLA). Antimicrobial 
sensitivity of S. aureus strains was evaluated using the disk diffusion technique, and β-lactamase detection was achieved using 
the chromogenic test with paper discs impregnated with nitrocefin. From all the mammary quarters examined, 36 (10.8%) 
were positive for Staphylococcus spp., 83.3% were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS), 11.1% were coagulase-positive 
staphylococcus (CPS), and 5.6% were of CPS+CNS positive. All isolates of S. aureus produced at least 1 toxin and 5 out of 6 
isolates (83.0%) produced β-lactamase. One hundred percent of S. aureus isolates were sensitive to methicillin and amoxicillin +  
clavulanic  acid,  and  resistant  to  ampicillin,  penicillin,  and  oxacillin. Analysis  of  the  results  obtained  in  the  current  study 
highlight the epidemiologic importance of buffalo milk regarding the production of enterotoxins and TSST-1 and the potential 
risk to public health.

Buffalo  present  sanitary  problems  similar  to  other  bovine 
species, particularly mastitis,5 which is considered one of the 
main problems in the dairy industry worldwide and affects 
all production species. The most important effect is related 
to economic losses due to decrease in milk yield.7 Among the 
microorganisms responsible for mastitis, bacteria are impli-
cated  as  the  principal  etiologic  agents.2  Bacteria  isolated 
with greatest frequency are Staphylococcus aureus, Staphy-
lococcus spp., Bacillus spp., Corynebacterium spp., Esch-
erichia coli, Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., and 
Klebsiella spp.7,9,13

Besides causing mastitis, the genera Staphylococcus are 
the etiologic agents responsible for approximately 45% of 
toxin  infections  worldwide.  Contamination  can  occur  by 
strains of environmental or human origin during the stages 
of food production or storage; in favorable temperature con-
ditions, the microorganism grows and may produce toxins.16 
The enterotoxins produced by S. aureus are part of a broad 
family of pyrogenic toxins produced by bacteria from both 
the Staphylococcus and Streptococcus genera. These toxins 
can cause toxic shock syndrome and are commonly associ-
ated with food intoxication and many types of allergies and 
autoimmune  diseases.3 The  objectives  of  the  current  study 
were to isolate and characterize the strains of Staphylococcus 
spp. of buffalo milk, and evaluate the sensitivity profile in 
vitro  and  the  capacity  of  S.  aureus  isolates  to  produce 

enterotoxins,  toxic  shock  syndrome  toxin-1  (TSST-1),  and 
β-lactamase.

The study involved 137 female buffalo of the Murrah and 
Mediterranean breeds, totaling 548 mammary quarters. The 
buffalo cows in various stages of lactation were bred in a 
semi-intensive management system and originated from dif-
ferent dairy properties located in 3 cities of the State of São 
Paulo. Six of the farms used mechanical means of milking, 
and 1 farm milked manually.

After  washing  the  udders  with  soap  and  water,  drying 
them with paper towels, and performing antisepsis of the teat 
ostium with 70% isopropyl alcohol, 10-ml samples of milk 
were collected from mammary quarters positive and nega-
tive  for  the  California  Mastitis  Test14  in  sterilized  flasks 
and identified with the name or number of the buffalo and 
the respective room. Following collection, the samples were

placed in isothermal boxes containing ice packs and immedi-
ately sent to the laboratory to be processed.

For  microbiological  analysis,  aliquots  of  0.1-ml  milk 
samples were inoculated on plates containing Columbia agar 
base enriched with 5% defibrinated sheep blood. The plates 
were incubated at 37ºC in a bacteriological incubator under 
aerobiosis conditions and examined for growth at 24, 48, and 
72 hr. To identify Staphylococcus spp., the growth charac-
teristics in blood agar colonies, the production of hemolysis, 
pigment, and the staining characteristics of Gram technique 
were analyzed. Other biochemical tests performed on bac-
terial  colonies  included  catalase,  thermonuclease,  Voges–
Proskauer, coagulase, fermentation of mannitol, trehalose, 
raffinose, xylose, sucrose, arabinose, and lactose under aero-
biosis conditions, fermentation of mannitol and of glucose 
under anaerobiosis conditions, urease, reduction of nitrate 
to nitrite, acetoin and oxidase production, and novobiocin 
resistance.

Determination  of  the  capacity  of  the  S.  aureus  strain  to 
produce enterotoxins A–D and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 
(TSST-1) was conducted by the reverse passive latex agglu-
tination (RPLA) technique using 2 commercial kits.a,b The 
cellophane-over-agar technique11 was used to obtain the 
supernatant from lavage of cultures grown on previously 
sterilized cellophane. The supernatants were filtered using 
nitrocellulose membranes with porosity between 0.2 and 0.45 
mm. The filtrates were analyzed for enterotoxins A–D (EEA, 
EEB, EEC, and EED) and TSST-1, following the manufac-
turer’s recommendations. The result was considered positive 
if the agglutination reaction occurred. Negative controls were 
used with all samples tested.

The antimicrobial sensitivity of S. aureus strains was eval-
uated using the drug diffusion technique in Mueller–Hinton 

agar10 and using S. aureus ATCC 25923c as a reference strain 
for  the  test.  The  following  antimicrobial  drugs  were  used: 
ampicillin  (10  mcg),d  cephalothin  (30  mcg),d  erythromycin 
(15 mcg),d penicillin (10 UI),d oxacillin (1 mcg),d tetracycline 
(30  mcg),d  cefoperazone  (75  mcg),d  gentamicin  (10  mcg),d 
enrofloxacin (5 mcg),d methicillin (5 mcg),a and amoxicillin 
associated  with  clavulanic  acid  (70  mcg).e  The  quantity  of 
microorganisms was measured in culture medium after 18 hr 
of incubation at 37ºC using McFarland standard.

For the S. aureus isolates, evaluation of the capacity of 
β-lactamase  production  was  determined  by  the  chromo-
genic test using paper discs impregnated with nitrocefin.e 
The colonies were cultured on plate surface, and the occur-
rence of pink and red staining on the surface was consid-
ered positive, while the absence of staining was considered 
negative for β-lactamase. Neisseria gonorrhoeae was used 
as positive control and Haemophilus influenzae as negative 
control.

The results of Staphylococcus spp. identified in the current 
study are presented in Table 1. The most frequently identified 
Staphylococcus spp. isolated was Staphylococcus epidermidis 
(30.56%), followed by Staphylococcus simulans (16.67%). 
Global increase in intramammary infection in ruminants by 
coagulase-negative  staphylococcus  (CNS),  coliforms,  and 
S. aureus has been reported, while infection by Streptococcus 
agalactiae  has  diminished  (Costa  EO,  Garino  F  Jr, 
Watanabe ET, et al.: 1997, Evaluation of the CMT positiv-
ity and the microbiologic status of the mammary gland over 
the  different  lactation  phases  in  buffalo  cows  (Bubalus 
bubalis). Proceedings of the fifth World Buffalo Congress, 
pp. 631–634, Caserta, Italy).

The importance of CNS as the causal agent of intramam-
mary infections continues to increase. Previously, CNS were 
considered agents of lesser importance17; however, numerous 
studies involving different species have demonstrated the asso-
ciation  of  CNS  with  several  disorders,  including  mastitis.6,8 
Thus, the findings of 2 samples of S. epidermidis in the present 
study,  associated  with  the  California  Mastitis  Test,  suggest 
that CNS are responsible for buffalo mastitis.

Other species of CNS such as S. simulans, S. saprophyti-
cus, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, S. caprae, S. lugdunensis,  
S. xylosus, S. capitis, and S. warneri were isolated (Table 1). 
The presence of such agents could be related to the fact that 
all of these species form part of human skin microbiota and 
despite antiseptic teat care, certain species show a relatively 
strong degree of adherence to epithelial cells in the dermis, 
presenting formation of biofilm.1

The antimicrobial sensitivity profile verified in the present 
study  indicated  that  S.  aureus  isolated  from  buffalo  milk 
presented greater sensitivity to the antibiotics methicil-
lin  (100%),  amoxicillin  associated  with  clavulanic  acid 
(100%),  cephalothin  (84.0%),  and  gentamicin  (67.0%),  and 
total resistance (100%) to ampicillin, penicillin, and oxacillin. 
Regarding CNS, 88.0% presented sensitivity to gentamicin, 
the  most  efficient  antibiotic  in  relation  to  those  tested,  and 
greatest  resistance  to  penicillin  (100%).  The  β-lactamase

production  capacity  determined  in  6  samples  of  S.  aureus 
demonstrated that 5 (83.0%) were producers.

While  evaluating  Staphylococcus  spp.  strains  from  buf-
falo mastitis, a previous study6 determined that the samples 
showed greater sensitivity to enrofloxacin (93.0%), followed 
by gentamicin (92.5%), while ampicillin was the least effec-
tive antibiotic. The differences in results between the previ-
ous and current studies could be associated with variations in 
and the differentiated use of the active principals that com-
pose antibiotics between countries and between regions of 
the same country.

The high resistance of S. aureus strains to penicillin and 
ampicillin is probably associated with the indiscriminate use 
of these drugs over the years; moreover, approximately 83.0% 
of isolated strains of S. aureus are β-lactamase producers, a 
factor of importance when conducting research concerning 
the association of amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (inhibitor 
of β-lactamase) in that 100% sensitivity to this combination of 
drugs was obtained. In the toxigenic analysis from 6 isolated 
samples of S. aureus, 5 (83.3%) were positive for TSST-1 
and 1 (16.6%) for EEA.

All of the samples of S. aureus analyzed produced toxins, 
5  produced TSST-1,  and  1  produced  EEA.  Several  studies 
have  been  conducted  involving  enterotoxin  research  and 
TSST-1 in bovids4,9,12 and caprids15,18; however, for buffalo, 
very few studies exist.

The  detection  of  enterotoxins  and TSST-1  is  decisive  in 
determining the toxigenicity of strains. Such findings are of 
fundamental  importance  from  an  epidemiological  point  of 
view because references regarding the presence of staphylo-
coccus toxins obtained from buffalo milk were not available 
in the veterinary literature. This finding is of importance to 
public health because 100% of the samples agglutinated, with 
scores of up to +++; moreover, considering that the strains are 
thermoresistant,  they  would  not  be  inactivated  by  the  tem-
perature of boiling milk commonly used in domestic environ-
ments. Further studies with different strains of S. aureus and 
CNS are required to determine the real importance of these 
toxins for public and animal health.

Analysis of the results obtained in the current study show 
the  necessity  of  more  in-depth  epidemiological  studies  to 
determine the importance and dynamics of CNA as emer-
gent pathogens in cases of buffalo mastitis in Brazil. Another 
point that should be highlighted is related to the production 
of enterotoxins and TSST-1 by S. aureus strains because this 
is a potential risk to public health. The increased resistance 
to antibiotics and the production of β-lactamase should alert 
diagnosticians to the possible indiscriminate use of antibiotics 
without proper management by producers and veterinarians 
working in the countryside.
