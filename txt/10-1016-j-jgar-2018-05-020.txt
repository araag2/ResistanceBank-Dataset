Objectives:  Poultry  is  one  of  the  main  sources  of  food  in  the  world.  Antimicrobial-resistant  Escherichia  coli
can  be  transmitted  to  humans  by  contact  with  poultry  waste  or  by  contaminated  poultry  products,
contributing  to  the  increasing  crisis  of  antimicrobial  resistance.  This  study  aimed  to  determine  the
incidence  of  antimicrobial  resistance  in  E.  coli  isolated  from  chickens  in  Taif  province,  Saudi  Arabia,  and  to
identify  the  genes  responsible  for  any  resistance  observed.
Methods:  A  total  of  150  cloacal  swabs  were  aseptically  obtained  from  chickens  from  different  farms,  from
which  180  colonies  of  E.  coli  were  identiÔ¨Åed  using  standard  microbiology  procedures.  Antimicrobial
susceptibility  testing  was  performed  by  the  Kirby‚ÄìBauer  disk  diffusion  method.  The  genes  blaSHV,  aac(3)-
IV,  tet(A),  tet(B),  aadA1,  catA1,  cmlA,  ere(A)  and  sul1  were  detected  by  PCR.
Results:  Most  of  the  E.  coli  isolates  showed  resistance  to  oxacillin  (99%),  lincomycin  (98%)  and
oxytetracycline  (97%).  The  prevalence  of  resistance  to  chloramphenicol  (73%),  ciproÔ¨Çoxacin  (59%)  and
Œ≤-lactams  (blaSHV)  and  tetracyclines  [tet(A)  and
ampicillin  (51%)  was  lower.  Genes  conferring  resistance  to 
tet(B)]  were  observed  at  prevalences  of  96%  and  95%,  respectively,  among  the  E.  coli 
isolates.
Chloramphenicol  (catA1  and  cmlA)  and  erythromycin  [ere(A)]  resistance  genes  showed  prevalences  of
72%  and  15%,  respectively,  whereas  gentamicin  [aac(3)-IV],  streptomycin  (aadA1)  and  sulfonamide  (sul1)
resistance  genes  were  detected  in  20%,  20%  and  10%  of  the  studied  isolates,  respectively.
Conclusion:  A  signiÔ¨Åcant  prevalence  of  antimicrobial  resistance  genes  was  observed  among  E.  coli  isolates
from  farm  chickens,  supporting  strict  regulatory  procedures  for  the  use  of  antimicrobial  agents.

1.  Introduction

Poultry  is  an  increasing  source  of  food  in  the  world.  However,
it 
is  also  one  of  the  most  consumed  foodstuffs  commonly
associated  with  outbreaks  of 
foodborne  disease.  Pathogenic
micro-organisms  can  be  transferred  to  humans  by  contact  with
poultry  waste  or  by  contaminated  poultry  foodstuffs.  The  avian
gut  has  been  considered  as  a  reservoir  of  Escherichia  coli  that
could  potentially  be  transmitted  from  birds  to  humans  [1].
Escherichia  coli  is  a  Gram-negative  bacterium  that  generally  acts
as  a  natural  commensal  in  the  digestive  tracts  of  humans,  animals
and  birds,  but  some  strains  are  signiÔ¨Åcant 
intestinal  and
extraintestinal  pathogens  [2].

Pathogenic  E.  coli  from  animals,  birds  and  humans  can  cause  a
variety  of  diseases,  ranging  from  self-limiting  gastrointestinal
infections  to  bacteraemia.  Antimicrobial  agents  have  been  used  for
various  veterinary  and  agricultural  purposes,  including  animal
husbandry  and  poultry  production  where  poultry  feed  is  supple-
mented  with  antibiotics  [3].  Moreover,  antibiotics  are  widely
utilised  to  control  infectious  illnesses  and  as  growth  promoters  in
poultry  production.  Application  of  antimicrobials  and  their  misuse
is  considered  to  be  the  most  important  selecting  inÔ¨Çuence  for  the
spread  of  antimicrobial  resistance  in  bacteria  both  in  human  and
veterinary  medicine  [4].  Indeed,  antimicrobial  resistance  devel-
oped  in  pathogens  colonising  animals  can  cause  the  emergence
and  distribution  of  resistant  E.  coli 
that  are  subsequently
transmitted  to  humans  by  contact  with 
infected  animals  or
derived  products  [5].  During  carcass  processing,  resistant  bacteria
from  the  poultry  gastrointestinal  tract  can  contaminate  the  meat
product.  Even  wild  migrating  and  resident  birds  can  act  as  carriers
and 
(MDR)  E.  coli  and
Escherichia  vulneris  [1].

Recently,  the  levels  of  antimicrobial  resistance  reported  in
bacteria  have  increased  due  to  the  high  use  of  antibiotics  in
veterinary  medicine,  partly  mediated  by  the  spread  of  resistance-
conferring  plasmids  between  and  within  bacterial  species  [6].

MDR  but  non-pathogenic  E.  coli  in  the  gastrointestinal  tract
could  be  a  signiÔ¨Åcant  reservoir  of  resistance  genes  [7].  Therefore,
the  aim  of  this  work  was  to  isolate  E.  coli  strains  from  chickens  in
different  farms  of  Taif  (Makkah  Province,  Saudi  Arabia)  in  order  to
evaluate  their  resistance  patterns  to  selected  antimicrobial  agents
and  to  identify  the  genes  conferring  any  resistance  detected.

2.  Materials  and  methods

2.1.  Sample  collection

Sterile  swab  sticks  moistened  with  sterile  normal  saline  were
inserted  into  the  cloacae  of  150  chickens  from  different  farms  in
Taif  and  were  placed  in  sterile  vials.  Following  sample  collection,
the  samples  were  transported  immediately  to  the  laboratory  in  an
insulating  foam  box  with  ice  and  were  stored  at  4 C  until  use.

2.2.  Isolation  and  identiÔ¨Åcation  of  Escherichia  coli

ciproÔ¨Çoxacin; oxytetracycline; norÔ¨Çoxacin; lincomycin; gentamicin;
amoxicillin;  enroÔ¨Çoxacin;  piperacillin;  amikacin;  cefalotin;  cefur-
oxime;  cefoxitin;  ceftazidime;  ceftriaxone;  cefepime;  aztreonam;
amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid  (AMC);  piperacillin/tazobactam  (TZP);
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole  (SXT);  and 
levoÔ¨Çoxacin.  Plates
were  incubated  at  37 C  for  24  h  and  the  inhibition  zone  diameter
was  measured  with  a  meter  rule  and  was  recorded.

2.4.  DNA  extraction  of  Escherichia  coli  isolates

Escherichia  coli  isolates  were  subcultured  overnight  in  Luria‚Äì
Bertani  broth  and  genomic  DNA  was  extracted  using  a  Wizard1
Genomic  DNA  PuriÔ¨Åcation  Kit 
(Promega,  Southampton,  UK)
according  to  the  manufacturer‚Äôs  instructions.

2.5.  Primers  and  PCR  assay  for  speciÔ¨Åc  genes

The  incidence  of  genes  related  to  resistance  to 

Œ≤-lactams  (blaSHV),
gentamicin  [aac(3)-IV],  streptomycin  (aadA1),  tetracyclines  [tet(A)
and  tet(B)],  chloramphenicol  (catA1  and  cmlA),  erythromycin  [ere
(A)]  and  sulfonamides (sul1)  was  determined  by basic  PCR.  The  set of
primers  used  for  each  gene  is  shown  in  Table  1.

The  primers  were  designed  using  the  Primer-BLAST  website

Cloacal  swabs  were 

inoculated  on  MacConkey  agar  plates
(Oxoid  Ltd.,  Basingstoke,  UK)  and  were  incubated  at  37 C  for  18‚Äì
24  h.  Then,  300  bacterial  colonies  (2  colonies  per  chicken)  were
picked  from  the  MacConkey  agar  as  smooth  pink  colonies.  Only  180
colonies  were  analysed  further.  Suspected  colonies  of  E.  coli  were
grown  on  nutrient  agar  plates  (Oxoid  Ltd.)  after  a  series  of
subculturing  on  MacConkey  agar.  The  isolates  were  characterised
by  Gram  staining,  triple  sugar  iron  agar  and  lysine  iron  agar,  and  for
oxidative/fermentative  degradation  of  glucose,  citrate  utilisation,
urease  production,  indole  test,  tryptophan  degradation,  glucose
degradation  (methyl  red  test)  and  motility.  The  E.  coli  isolates  were
stored  in  tryptic  soy  broth  (Merck,  Darmstadt,  Germany)  with  15%
glycerol  at 

 20 C.

Loughborough,  UK)  as  follows:  3  min  at  95 C;  35  cycles  each
consisting  of  1  min  at  94 C,  90  s  at  the  annealing  temperature
(Table  1)  and  1  min  at  72 C;  followed  by  a 
Ô¨Ånal  extension  step  of
10  min  at  72 C.  PCR  ampliÔ¨Åcation  was  performed  in  duplicate.
AmpliÔ¨Åed  samples  were  analysed  by  electrophoresis 
in  1.5%
agarose  gel  and  were  stained  with  ethidium  bromide.  A  molecular
weight  marker  with  100-bp  increments  (100-bp  DNA  ladder)  was
used  as  a  size  standard.

Antimicrobial  susceptibility  was  determined  by  the  Kirby‚ÄìBauer
disk  diffusion  method  as  described  by  the  Clinical  and  Laboratory
Standards  Institute  (CLSI)  [8]  on  Mueller‚ÄìHinton  agar  plates  using
single  antimicrobial  disks  (Bio-Rad  Laboratories,  Hemel  Hempstead,
UK).  The  following  antimicrobials  were  used:  cefaclor;  oxacillin;
ampicillin; 
colistin;

cefalexin;  neomycin;

The  E.  coli  isolates  were  screened  for  antimicrobial  susceptibili-
ty  (Table  2).  Among  the  180  E.  coli  isolates,  high  rates  of  resistance
were  observed  to  oxacillin  (99%),  lincomycin  (98%)  and  oxytetra-
cycline 
to  other
antimicrobials  were  observed:  chloramphenicol,  73%;  ciproÔ¨Çoxa-
cin,  59%;  ampicillin,  51%;  amoxicillin,  43%;  piperacillin,  28%;
gentamicin,  21%;  neomycin,  21%;  and  cefalexin,  14%.  However,
much 
lower  resistance  was  observed  to  SXT  (11%),  cefaclor,
norÔ¨Çoxacin,  enroÔ¨Çoxacin  (each  10%),  amikacin,  cefalotin  (each  2%),
colistin,  cefuroxime,  cefoxitin,  ceftazidime,  ceftriaxone,  cefepime,
aztreonam,  AMC,  TZP  and  levoÔ¨Çoxacin  (each  1%).  Moreover,  178
(99%)  of  the  180  E.  coli  were  MDR  (resistant  to  at  least  three
different  classes  of  antimicrobials  in  the  panel  of  drugs  examined).

3.3.  Antimicrobial  resistance  genes

The  distribution  of  resistance  genes  among  phenotypically
resistant  E.  coli  isolated  from  chickens  is  shown  in  Table  3.  The
Œ≤-lactams,  aac(3)-IV  for  gentamicin,  tet
resistance  genes  blaSHV for 
(A)  and  tet(B)  for  tetracyclines,  aadA1  for  streptomycin,  catA1  and
cmlA  for  chloramphenicol,  ere(A)  for  erythromycin  and  sul1  for
sulfonamides  were  investigated.  Among  the  180  E.  coli  isolates,  96%
gave  positive  amplicons  for  the  blaSHV gene,  followed  by  tet(A)  and
tet(B)  (95%).  Moreover,  72%  of  the  E.  coli  isolates  carried  catA1  and
cmlA.  The  resistance  genes  aac(3)-IV  (20%),  aadA1  (20%),  ere(A)
(15%)  and  sul1  (10%)  were  also  observed  among  the  E.  coli  isolates.

4.  Discussion

This  study  revealed  a  high  percentage  (99%)  of  MDR  isolates
among  E.  coli  isolated  from  farm  chickens  compared  with  MDR  E.
coli  recovered  from  chicken  farms  (85.3%)  in  Tien  Giang  Province,

South  Vietnam  [10].  The  percentage  of  tetracycline  resistance
among  E.  coli 
in  the  current  study  was  higher  (97%)  than
tetracycline-resistant  E.  coli  in  Vietnam  (93.4%).  The  current  study
showed  that  99%  and  98%  of  E.  coli  were  resistant  to  oxacillin  and
lincomycin,  respectively.  Moreover,  this  study  revealed  that  99%  of
E.  coli  isolates  recovered  from  chickens  were  MDR.  This  high
prevalence  of  multidrug  resistance  among  E.  coli  in  these  samples
might  due  to  the  use  of  antimicrobials  for  veterinary  purposes  both
for  prescription  reasons  to  control  bacterial  invasion  and  as  growth
promoters  to  increase  poultry  chicken  production.  A  previous
study  reported  a  high  prevalence  of  antimicrobial-resistant  E.  coli
O157:H7  isolates  from  poultry  farms  in  Eastern  Ethiopia  [11].
Recent  results  revealed  that  the  antimicrobial  susceptibility  of  174
E.  coli  isolates  collected  from  healthy  poultry,  bovines  and  ovines
showed  high  incidences  of  resistance  to  tetracyclines,  streptomy-
cin,  amoxicillin  and  SXT  [12].

Resistance  of  E.  coli 

isolates  of  poultry  origin 

to  some
conventional  antimicrobials  has  been  reported  both  within  and
outside  Nigeria  [13,14].  Antimicrobial-resistant  E.  coli  may  persist
in  the  intestinal  tract  of  poultry  birds  for  a  long  period  of  time  with
or  without  the  use  of  antimicrobials,  and  they  can  serve  as  route  via
which  they  can  be  transmitted  to  the  human  population  or  through
consumption.  Continuous  usage  of  antimicrobials  outside  the
health  system,  especially  for  veterinary  and  livestock  purposes,
still  continues.  In  order  not  to  return  to  the  pre-antibiotic  era  when
there  were  no  conventional  antimicrobials  as  we  now  have  to  treat
many  bacterial-related  diseases,  it  is  very  important  that  urgent
and  consolidated  efforts  are  put  in  place  and  sustained  in  order  to
abate  the  problem  of  antimicrobial  resistance.

However,  some  strains  of  E.  coli  have  been  implicated  in  a
number  of  resistant  infections  in  humans,  and  this  includes  E.  coli
isolates  harbouring  multidrug  resistance  genes  such  as  extended-
Œ≤-lactamase  (ESBL)  enzymes,  amongst  others  [15].  The
spectrum 
multidrug  resistance  detected  in  this  study  might  be  mediated  by
mobile  genetic  elements  such  as  resistance  genes,  as  seen  in  the
case  of  other  studies.  In  the  present  study,  there  was  a  high
percentage  of  E.  coli  harbouring  blaSHV (96%).  A  recent  study
Œ≤-lactamase  genes  of  E.  coli
reported  that  the  most  prevalent 
isolated  from  environmental,  human  and  food  samples  in  Spain
were  blaCTX-M-14 (26%)  and  blaCTX-M-1 (21.4%),  followed  by  blaSHV-12,
blaCTX-M-15 and  blaTEM-42 [16].  The  current  study  reported  that  the
aadA1  and  aac(3)-IV  genes  were  present  in  20%  of  E.  coli.  AAD
aminoglycoside  adenylyltransferases  can  confer  resistance  to
gentamicin,  tobramycin  or  streptomycin  among  Gram-negative
bacteria  [17].

The  sul1  gene  was  observed  in  10%  of  E.  coli  in  the  present  study.
In  2007  in  Vietnam,  dissemination  of  sul  genes  in  three  environ-
ments  (swine 
farms,  shrimp  ponds  and  a  city  canal)  was
investigated  and  the  incidence  generally  followed  sul1 
  sul3
[18],  in  agreement  with  the  frequency  of  the  sul  gene  in  the  present
study  conferring  resistance  to  sulfamethoxazole.  The  tet(A)  and  tet
(B)  genes  were  detected  in  95%  of  E.  coli  isolates  in  the  current
study.  Previous  results  stated  that  the  tet(A)  resistance  gene  was
prevalent  in  86%  of  E.  coli  [19].

growth-promoting  agents  during  the  past  decade  has  produced
enormous  pressure  for  selection  of  antimicrobial  resistance  among
bacterial  pathogens  worldwide.  Therefore,  reducing  the  use  of  and
careful  application  of  antimicrobials  in  animal  farming  and  clinical
practices  should  be  applied.

5.  Conclusion

These  results  conÔ¨Årm  the  faecal  carriage  of  antimicrobial-
resistant  E.  coli  in  poultry  chickens  raised  in  Taif,  Saudi  Arabia,
making  it  the 
Ô¨Årst  study  to  be  conducted  on  the  matter.  Also,
chickens  were  serving  as  reservoirs  of  highly  diverse  and  abundant
antimicrobial  resistance  genes.  These  resistance  genes  pose  a
potential  health  threat  to  the  public  and  animal  farming  in  the
country.
