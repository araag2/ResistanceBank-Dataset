Abstract 

The expression of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes confer 

low-level quinolone and fluoroquinolones resistance alone. However, the association to 

chromosomal  resistance  mechanisms  determines  an  expressively  higher  resistance  in 

Enterobacteriaceae.  These  mechanisms  are  horizontally  disseminated  within  plasmids 

and  have  contributed  to  the  emergence  of  bacteria  with  reduced  susceptibility  or 

resistant  to  therapies  worldwide.  The  epidemiological  characterization  of  PMQR 

dissemination are highly relevant in the scientific and medical context, to investigate the 

dissemination  within  enterobacteria,  from  different  populations,  including  humans  and 

food-producing  animals.  In  the  present  study,  200  Enterobacteriaceae  isolates  were 

harvested  from  poultry  with  cloacal  swabs  and  identified  as  Escherichia  coli  (90.5%), 

Escherichia  fergusonii  (5.5%),  Klebsiella  oxytoca  (2.5%)  and  Klebsiella  pneumoniae

(1.5%).  Among  isolates  evaluated,  46  (23%)  harboured  PMQR  genes  including  qnrB 

(43/200),  qnrS  (2/200)  and  aac(6’)-Ib-cr  (1/200).  All  isolates  carrying  PMQR  genes 

showed  multidrug-resistance  phenotype.  The  36  E.  coli  isolates  showed  18  different 

PFGE types. All E. fergusonii isolates showed the same PFGE type. The two Klebsiella 

oxytoca belonged to two different PFGE types. The phylogenetic groups A, B1, and D 

were  found  among  the  E.  coli  harboring  PMQR  genes.  Based  on  the  phylogenetic 

analysis and PFGE, the population structure of E. coli isolates was diverse, even within 

the  same  farm.  All  isolates  carrying  qnrB  and  qnrS  genes  also  harboured  ColE-like 

plasmids.  The  Southern  blot  hybridization  using  the  S1-PFGE  revealed  that  the  qnrB 

gene  were  located  on  low  molecular  weight  plasmids,  smaller  than  10Kb.  Resistance 

plasmids  were  sequenced  and  showed  100%  identity  with  plasmid  pPAB19-3.  The 

association of PMQR genes with mobile genetic elements, such as transferable plasmids

prevalence of resistant bacteria in different environments reported worldwide. 

 

Introduction 

The introduction of fluoroquinolones in clinical therapies occurred in the 1980s 

and the advantage of oral administration associated with the bactericidal activity against 

Gram-negative  microorganisms  contributed  to  the  frequent  election  of  this  class  of 

antimicrobials  to  treat  infections  caused  by  Escherichia  coli,  Salmonella  and  other 

Enterobacteriaceae in humans and animals, to date. (Dalhoff, 2012; Vanni et al., 2014;

(QRDR),  may  change  the  antibiotic  target  site,  consequently  reducing  the  therapeutic 

efficacy.  This  mechanism  associated  to  the  expression  of  plasmid-mediated  quinolone 

resistance  (PMQR)  genes  increases  the  resistance  level  of  the  bacteria,  frequently 

reaching  impracticable  minimal  inhibitory  concentration  (MIC)  (Harada  and  Asai, 

2010) (Gagliotti et al., 2008). The main PMQR determinants reported are the qnr genes 

(qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrD and qnrS) that mediate resistance to quinolones by protecting 

the antimicrobial  target  protein,  type  II  DNA topoisomerases, from  the  action of  these 

antimicrobials  (Rodriguez-Martinez  et  al.,  2011).  Moreover,  there  are  other  PMQR 

determinants,  for  example,  aac(6’)-Ib–cr  genes,  which  codify  acetyltransferase,  an 

aminoglycoside  modifying  enzyme  able  to  acetylate  fluoroquinolones  due  to  the  “–cr 

variant” and the QepA and OqxAB efflux pump proteins, that decrease susceptibility to 

hydrophilic  fluoroquinolones.  The  expression  of  these  genes  associated  with  other

resistance  mechanisms,  such  as  alteration  of  the  target  site,  porin  alterations,    and 

overexpression of chromosomal efflux systems have been contributing to the increased

This  study  was  conducted  to  evaluate  the  the  prevalence  of  PMQR  determinants  and 

characterize  plasmids  harbouring  these  genes  in  Enterobacteriaceae  isolated  from

Materials and Methods 

Isolation of bacteria 

From  2011  to  2012,  a  total  of  200  isolates  were  screened  from  200  healthy  chickens 

from two different poultry Farms in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The procedure for sampling 

was previously approved by the Institutional Animal Use and  Ethics Committee (Proc. 

n. 12.1.248.53.7). The cloacal swab samples were seeded onto MacConkey agar plates

containing  ciprofloxacin  (2µg/mL)  and  incubated  for  24h/37ºC.  Colonies  were 

identified  by  biochemical  standard  methods,  confirmed  by  API  20E  test  (BioMérieux, 

France)  and,  in  some  cases,  the  identification  was  performed  by  VITEK®2 

(BioMérieux, France).

(Applied Biosystems, USA) with the same primers used for PCR.  

The total genomic DNA of the isolates was extracted as described previously (Bolano et 

al., 2001), and used in the PCR for the identification of the PMQR genes in all isolates. 

The  genes  qnrA,  qnrB,  qnrS  (Cattoir  et  al.,  2007),  qnrC,  qnrD  (Wang  et  al.,  2009),

Antimicrobial susceptibility 

The antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli isolates with PMQR genes were assessed by 

agar  disk  diffusion  method  following  the  recommendations  by  Clinical  Laboratory 

Standards  Institute  (CLSI,  2002),  using  breakpoints  recommended  by  CLSI  (CLSI, 

2013).  Fifteen  antimicrobial  drugs  (Oxoid,  UK)  were  tested:  amoxillin/clavulanic  acid 

(20/10µg), piperacillin/tazobactam (100/10µg), cefotaxime (30µg), ceftazidime (30µg), 

cefepime (30µg), cefoxitin (30µg), aztreonam (30µg), ertapenem (10µg), nalidixic acid 

(30µg),  ciprofloxacin  (5µg),  levofloxacin  (5µg),  enrofloxacin  (5µg),  tetracycline 

(30µg),  gentamicin 

(10µg), 

trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 

(1.25/23.75µg)  and 

chloramphenicol  (30µg). Multidrug-resistance  (MDR) phenotype  was characterized by 

non-susceptibility  or  resistance  to  at  least  one  agent  in  three  or  more  antimicrobial 

classes (Canton and Ruiz-Garbajosa, 2011; Magiorakos et al., 2012).

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) 

Genomic  DNA  of  qnr  positive  E.  coli  isolates  were  digested  with  restriction  enzyme 

XbaI  (Fermentas,  USA)  and  the  macrorestriction  separation  was  carried  out  using 

pulsed-field  gel  electrophoresis  (PFGE)  in  the  CHEF-DRIII  System  (Bio-Rad 

Laboratories, USA). The assay was performed in 1,2% agarose PFGE  gels at 6.0V/cm 

with  an  initial/final  switch  time  of  10/40  sec  and  an  angle  of  120°  at  14°C  for  24  h. 

Macrorestriction  patterns  were  analysed  using  the  BioNumerics  5.0  software  (Applied 

Maths,  USA).  Relationship  among  PFGE-types  was  analysed  by  the  Dice  similarity 

index to obtain a dendrogram with clusters. The dendrogram was constructed using the 

unweighted-pair  group  method  using  average  linkage  algorithm  (UPGMA).  The 

minimum threshold value for similar PFGE patterns was defined at 85%.

Phylogenetic Analysis 

The phylogenetic groups were determined according to the previously described method 

(Clermont et al., 2000), classifying isolates to one of the four phylogenetic groups (A, 

B1, B2, or D) based on the presence  of chuA, yjaA genes and TspE4C2 DNA fragment. 

Plasmid replicon typing 

Plasmids  were  investigated  by  PCR-based  Replicon  Typing  (PBRT)  method  using 

primers for 18 major incompatibility (Inc) groups described (FIA, FIB, FIC, HI2, I1-I, 

L/M,  N,  P,  W,  T,  A/C,  K,  B/O,  X,  Y,  F,  FIIA,  HI1)  among  Enterobacteriaceae  as 

described  previously  (Carattoli  et  al.,  2005).  ColE  plasmids  were  also  searched  by 

previously  described  method  (Garcia-Fernandez  et  al.,  2009).  The  Inc  groups  were

determined  in  parental  strains  to  characterize  all  plasmids,  including  the  non-

conjugative.  

 

Determination of the PMQR 

To  determine  the  plasmids  harboring  the  PMQR  genes,  PFGE  was  performed,  after 

digestion  with  S1  nuclease  (S1-PFGE).  The  Lambda  Ladder  PFG  Marker  and  Low 

Range PFG Marker (Biolabs, USA) were used as size standards. The Southern blot and 

hybridization were performed using DNA probes specific for quinolone resistance genes

Antimicrobial resistance has been exponentially noticed in Enterobacteriaceae isolated 

from  infected  (Dalhoff,  2012)  and  colonized  humans  (Woerther  et  al.,  2013)  and  also

Liebana  et  al.,  2013;  Szmolka  et  al.,  2011;  Tamang  et  al.,  2011).  Two  hundred 

ciprofloxacin resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates were isolated from 200 cloacal swabs 

streaked  on  MacConkey  agar  plates,  selecting  one  colony  per  plate  after  incubation. 

Among  the  identified  isolates,  90.5%  were  E.  coli  (181/200),  5.5%  Escherichia 

fergusonni (11/200), 2.5% Klebsiella oxytoca (5/200) and 1.5% Klebsiella pneumoniae 

 

Out  of  200  Enterobacteriaceae  isolates  examined  in  this  study,  23%  (46/200) 

carried PMQR genes including qnrB (43/200), qnrS (2/200) and  aac(6’)-Ib-cr (1/200). 

Among Qnr-producing isolates carrying qnrB, 33 were E. coli isolates (qnrB19, n=29; 

qnrB5,  n=4),  7  E.  fergusonii  (qnrB19),  2  K.  oxytoca  (qnrB19)  and  1  K.  pneumoniae 

(qnrB19).  The  qnrS1  was  found  in  two  E.  coli  isolates  and  aac(6’)-Ib-cr  gene  was 

found in one E. coli isolate (Table 1). None isolate was positive for qnrA, qnrC, qnrD,

qnrB19 (n=39) was the  most prevalent  gene detected in  our study, followed by  qnrB5 

(n=4).  The  gene  qnrB19  was  reported  in  other  countries,  in  E.  coli  from  chickens,

In  this  study,  all  isolates  carrying  PMQR  genes  (46/46)  showed  MDR 

phenotype.  Among  these  isolates,  the  resistance  to  antibiotics  tested  was:  amoxicillin-

NAL,  CIP  and  LEV  are  mainly  used  to  treat  urinary  tract  infections  and  respiratory

selection of fluoroquinolone resistance among these animals. Furthermore, the oral use 

of  ENR  also  contributes  for  selection  of  resistance  to  non-quinolone  antimicrobials  in 

commensal  E.  coli  isolated  from  chickens  (Jurado  et  al.,  2015).  The  use  of  other 

antibiotic  classes,  such  as  beta-lactam  antibiotics,  could  advantage  co-selection  of 

fluoroquinolones non-susceptible E. coli from retail poultry (Ingram et al., 2013), when 

mobile  genetic  elements  (MGE),  carrying  multiple  antimicrobial  determinants  are 

involved, as explained elsewhere (Canton and Ruiz-Garbajosa, 2011). 

 

As shown in Table 1, the 36 E. coli isolates carrying PMQR genes exhibited 18 

different  PFGE types. The  qnrB resistance  genes  (qnrB19 and  qnrB5) were present  in 

different  E.  coli  isolates  classified  in  showed  15  PFGE  types  (A  to  O),  demonstrating 

the  dissemination  of  the  resistance  gene  within  a  diverse  bacterial  population.  Among 

the different PFGE types the major cluster "E" included 12 isolates producing qnrB19. 

Two different PFGE types were found in the two E. coli isolates carrying qnrS1 (Q and

R). The E. coli carrying aac(6’)-Ib-cr belonged to a different PFGE type (P). Results in 

Table 2, show that all E. fergusonii carrying qnrB19 belonged to the same PFGE type 

(Ef  A).  Although,  the  two  Klebsiella  oxytoca  isolates  carrying  qnrB19  were  from 

different PFGE types (Table 2). The evaluation of the resistant E. coli population from 

farm 1 and farm 2 shows nine different PFGE types in each farm, carrying the resistance 

genes, without any common PFGE type shared between farms. These findings suggest 

that  the  dissemination  of  the  resistance  genes  is  most  likely  associated  to  MGE  (e.g. 

plasmids),  exchanged  among  different  isolates,  rather  than  with  a  unique  resistant 

isolate prevailing. The phylogenetic groups A, B1, and D were found among the E. coli 

harboring  PMQR  genes.  Most  isolates  were  identified  in  the  phylogenetic  group  A 

(50%), other 42% of the isolates were classified in the phylogenetic group D and 8% of 

the  isolates  were  identified  phylogenetic  group  B1  (Table  1).  None  of  the  isolates

belonged  phylogenetic  group  B2.  In  addition,  14  qnrB19-producing  belonged  to 

phylogenetic  group  D.  Based  on  the  phylogenetic  analysis  and  PFGE,  the  population 

structure  of  E.  coli  isolates  was  diverse,  even  within  the  same  poultry  farm, 

characterizing  a  non-clonal  dissemination  and  demonstrating  the  potential  of  these 

genes  and  MGEs  to  be  maintained  by  different  E.  coli  populations.  Isolates  within 

phylogenetic group B2 reported, as the most virulent, frequently causing infections were 

not  detected.  Nevertheless,  among  the  phylogenetic  groups  identified  in  the  present 

work, group D has also been involved in extraintestinal infections, causing concerns in 

clinical  settings.  The  phylogenetic  groups  A  and  B1  are  considered  less  virulent, 

however, were also described in human extraintestinal infections (Pitout, 2012). . 

As shown in Table 1, in all isolates, the qnrB and qnrS genes were harboured on 

ColE-like plasmids. Moreover, 43 E. coli isolates carrying qnrB in ColE-like plasmids, 

also carried other replicon types, including IncHI1 (n = 1), IncI1 (n = 2), IncFIA (n = 3),

Enterobacteriaceae,  including  E.  coli,  E.  fergusonii  and  K.  oxytoca,  were  found 

carrying  PMQR  determinant  genes  harbored  in  ColE-like  plasmids.  Moreover,  these 

isolates  also  harbored  other  important  replicon  types.  The  increased  resistance  to 

quinolones and fluoroquinolones, determined by  PMQR  genes, was noticed in  isolates

Conclusion 

 

that  also  showed  resistance  to  other  important  antibiotics  such  as  AMC,  CTX,  CAZ, 

ATM, GEN, CHL, TET. These characteristics were present in a diverse population of E. 

coli,  as  shown  by  PFGE  and  phylogeny,  demonstrating  that  this  dissemination  of 

resistance has a non-clonal nature. The concern about the dissemination of PMQR genes 

is  that these  genes may  facilitate the selection of higher levels  of quinolone resistance 

(Jacoby  et  al.,  2014).  It  is  difficult  to  determine  the  incidence  and  prevalence  of  this 

plasmid carrying these genes, however, silent dissemination may be occurring in many 

ecological settings and in different countries in South America. 

 

A  high  prevalence  of  PMQR  determinants  was  found  in  Enterobacteriaceae 

isolated from healthy chickens. Different Enterobacteriaceae harboured these genes and 

the  genes  were  found  in  two  poultry  Farms,  showing  the  dissemination  of  resistant 

bacteria  in  food-producing  animals,  which  may  play  an  important  role  in  the  current 

increased  prevalence  of  MDR  bacteria  in  different  environments  reported  worldwide.

Therefore, the surveillance of resistant genes in the food chain is considered a key point 

to assist in the control of antimicrobial resistance.

Highlights 

 

 

  Evaluation  of  antimicrobial  resistance  in  enterobacteria  from  commercial 

chickens 

  High  prevalence  of  PMQR  determinants  in  Enterobacteriaceae  isolated  from 

  Multidrug resistance (MDR) in commensal Enterobacteriaceae carrying PMQR 

  Dissemination of PMQR occurred by ColE-like plasmids 
  Characterization of plasmids carrying qnrB genes
