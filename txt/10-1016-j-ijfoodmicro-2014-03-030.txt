The aims of this study were to investigate the serotype distribution, genetic relationships and antibiotic resis-
tance of Salmonella from food-producing animals in Shandong province of China in 2009 and 2012. A total of
362 out of 1825 samples from chickens, 53 out of 445 samples from ducks, and 50 out of 692 samples from
pigs were positive for Salmonella. Isolates were subjected to serotyping, antibiotic susceptibility testing (15 anti-
biotics) and pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The most common serotypes recovered in the chicken samples
were Enteritidis (n = 294, 81.2%) and Indiana (n = 45, 12.4%). For ducks, Cremieu (n = 25, 47.2%), Indiana (n = 13,
24.5%) and Typhimurium (n = 9, 17%) were frequently isolated. In the pig samples, Derby (n = 29, 58%),
Typhimurium (n = 9, 18%), and Enteritidis (n = 6, 12%) were the most common serovars. PFGE results indicated
that clonal dissemination of each serovar was prevalent, and that the Salmonella found on the poultry carcasses was
caused by cross-contamination in the abattoirs. More than 99% of the Salmonella isolates collected were resistant to
at least one antibiotic. The Salmonella resistance rates for 15 antibiotics in 2012 were signiﬁcantly higher than those
in 2009. In 2012, the highest resistance was to nalidixic acid (95.9%), followed by sulphafurazole (78.2%) and am-
picillin (72.3%); the lowest levels of resistance were to kanamycin (40.1%) and amikacin (38.7%). Additionally, 41.5%
and 42.2% of the Salmonella were resistant to ciproﬂoxacin and ceftiofur, respectively. Noticeably, 25% of the serovar
Enteritidis and all of the serovar Indiana were resistant to at least 10 antibiotics in 2012. The increasing trend of
antibiotic resistance in Shandong province indicates the need for more careful use of antibiotics.

1. Introduction

Non-typhoidal Salmonella is an important food-borne pathogen,
which can cause gastroenteritis and septicaemia in humans. Food-
producing animals play a role as a primary reservoir of non-typhoid
Salmonella, and most human Salmonella infections are a consequence
of eating food of animal origin that is contaminated with Salmonella
(Ribot et al., 2002). Slaughter is potentially the key time for contamina-
tion of food-producing animal carcasses and subsequently meat
products with Salmonella (Jong et al., 2009).

The use of antibiotics in food-producing animals has raised concerns
regarding their potential impact on human health (Anderson et al.,
2003). Resistant Salmonella may be transmitted through the food
chain to humans (Barza, 2002). Patients infected with Salmonella at
the extremes of age and those who are immunocompromised need ap-
propriate antimicrobial therapy (White et al., 2001). Because resistance

to conventional antibiotics has increased, extended-spectrum cephalo-
sporins and ﬂuoroquinolones have been chosen to treat infections
caused by multidrug resistant Salmonella (Su et al., 2004). In recent
years, Salmonella strains that are resistant to extended-spectrum ceph-
alosporins or ﬂuoroquinolones have been observed in some countries,
and surveillance data have indicated an increasing trend for drug-
resistance (Gupta et al., 2003; Biedenbach et al., 2006; Xia et al., 2008).
Because of the widespread commercial trade in animal derived food
products, surveillance of Salmonella serotype distribution and antibiotic
resistance levels in food-producing animals in individual countries is of
global importance. Knowledge about the epidemiology of different
serovars in different geographic regions may assist in recognising and
tracing new emerging pathogens (Bangtrakulnonth et al., 2004).

Shandong is located in the northeast of China, has a population of
95 million, and is the main producer of food of animal origin in China.
In this area, chicken, duck and pork farming is intensive, and the proc-
essed animal products are shipped to different markets all over China.
The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence, serotype
distribution, genetic relatedness and antibiotic susceptibility of Salmonella
isolated from chickens, ducks and pigs in Shandong, China. Additionally,
the current study investigated the Salmonella contamination rate for

2. Material and methods

2.1. Sample collection and Salmonella isolation

We chose two chicken broiler breeding farms, two chicken hatcher-
ies, two chicken abattoirs, three pig farms, and one duck abattoir in
eight important farming cities (Linyi, Xintai, Taian, Binzhou, Qingzhou,
Feicheng, Zhucheng and Dezhou) in Shandong province in 2009 and
2012 to perform the sample collection. All the investigated farms were
the largest in each city. The chicken and duck production line conditions
at these facilities were as follows. Poultry breeding stocks were raised in
breeding farms, and laid eggs were transferred to hatcheries in the same
city to incubate. The 1-day-old chicks or ducklings were sent to a num-
ber of farms in various cities, after which the 6- to 7-week-old poultry
were transported to several intensive abattoirs for processing. Chicken
and duck carcasses were shipped to markets or restaurants all over
China.

In this study, a total of 2962 samples were collected. The samples
included faeces from 1-day-old chickens (n = 373), caecal contents
from 7-week-old broilers (n = 705), 7-week-old broiler carcasses
(n = 361), faeces of 1-year-old broiler breeders (n = 386), caecal
contents of 6-week-old ducks (n = 385), duck carcasses (n = 60),
and rectal swabs of 80- to150-day-old pigs (n = 692) (Table 1).
Each sample was collected from a different individual animal. The
samples collected at each abattoir represent broilers or ducks from
different farms. Fresh faecal samples and caecal contents were trans-
ferred into buffered peptone water (BPW; Difco, Cockeysville, MD,
USA) at the volume ratio of 1:10, and then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C
for pre-enrichment. The carcasses were the 4 °C-chilled ﬁnal carcasses
from abattoirs; samples were collected with large sterile cotton swabs
prewetted with 5 ml of BPW, which was used to swab the whole
outer skin surface of each carcass. All the carcass swabs and rectal
swabs were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. After pre-enrichment, 300 μl
of BPW was added to 3 ml of selenite cystine broth (Oxiod, Basingstoke,
UK) and tetrathionate broth (Oxiod), and the cultures were incubated
at 37 °C and 42 °C for 20 h, respectively, after which some of the en-
richment cultures were simultaneously streaked onto CHROMagar
Salmonella agar (CHROMagar Company, Paris, France) and bismuth
sulphite agar (Oxiod). Colonies were incubated for 24–48 h at 37 °C.
One or two colonies (per sample) that were suspected of being infected
with Salmonella were selected for biochemical analysis using an API 20 E
(bioMérieux, Marcy l' Etoile, France) microsubstrate system for genus
identiﬁcation.

2.2. Serotyping

2.3. Antibiotic resistance testing

The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an antibiotic was de-
termined by the manual broth microdilution method according to the
criteria recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Insti-
tute (CLSI, 2008, 2013). The ATCC 25922 strain of Escherichia coli was
used as a control. The following 15 antibiotics were tested (concentration
range in mg/l): tetracycline (2–128), ampicillin (2–128), amoxicillin/
clavulanic acid (2/1–128/64), cefazolin (4–128), ceftiofur (0.25–128),
chloramphenicol (4–128), ﬂorfenicol (0.5–128), nalidixic acid (1–128),
ciproﬂoxacin (0.008–128), streptomycin (2–128), gentamicin (2–128),
kanamycin (0.5–128), amikacin (0.5–128), sulphafurazole (4–1024),
and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (2/38–8/152). No CLSI interpre-
tive criteria were available for streptomycin; hence, for analysis purposes,
samples with MIC values ≥ 64 μg/ml were considered to be resistant. All
the isolates which were classiﬁed as intermediate or resistant were
also considered to be resistant (except for ciproﬂoxacin, MIC values
≥ 1 μg/ml were considered to be resistant).

2.4. Pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis

PFGE assays of randomly selected Salmonella Enteritidis (30%),
Salmonella Indiana (60%), Salmonella Cremieu (60%), Salmonella
Typhimurium (100%) and Salmonella Derby (100%) isolates were per-
formed. Chromosomal DNA from the Salmonella isolates was digested
with XbaI and subjected to the standardised PulseNet PFGE protocol
(http://www.pulsenetinternational.org/protocols/Pages/default.aspx)
using the CHEF Mapper XA Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis System
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, California). Gel electrophoresis was carried out
for 18.5 h at 6.0 V/cm at a 120° angle and 14 °C, and an initial switch
time of 5 s and a ﬁnal switch time of 40 s. Salmonella serovar Braenderup
H9812 was used as a standard size marker. Cluster analysis of pulsotypes
was done according to the Dice coefﬁcient method using InfoQuest FP
Software/Version 4.5 (Bio-Rad).

2.5. Statistics

Statistical comparisons of the isolation rates and antibiotic resistance
rates among the different food-producing animals and serovars were
analysed using a Chi-square test and SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL; version 11.5).

highest isolation rates among the different animal sources tested for
those 2 years were both observed in 1-day-old chickens (64.1% in 2009
and 64.2% in 2012). The lowest isolation rates were in broiler breeders
(4.8% in 2009 and 5.5% in 2012) and pigs (10% in 2009 and 1.3% in
2012) (Table 1). No signiﬁcant difference was found in the Salmonella iso-
lation rate in ducks, 1-day-old chickens and chicken breeders between
2009 and 2012 (P N 0.05). Analysis of samples from abattoirs showed
that 21.7% of the duck carcasses and 13.9% of the chicken carcasses
were Salmonella-positive. However, only 10.4% of the duck caecal con-
tents samples and 7.5% of those from chickens were Salmonella-positive.

3.2. Salmonella serovar distribution in different food-producing
animal species

Twelve Salmonella isolates were untypeable (self-agglutination).
Eleven and 15 different serovars were identiﬁed in 2009 and 2012, re-
spectively (Table 2). The most common Salmonella serotype in 2009
and 2012 was Enteritidis (229/318, 72%, 71/147, 48.3%, respectively).
The Salmonella serovars showed preference for particular animal reser-
voirs. The Salmonella Enteritidis isolates were more widely disseminat-
ed in 1-day-old chickens (193 of 229 total Enteritidis isolates, 84.3%,
were from 1-day-old chickens, in 2009, and 34/71, 47.9% in 2012)
than other chicken growth stages (30/229, 13.1% in 2009 and 37/71,
52.1% in 2012) and pigs (6/229, 2.6%). Additionally, Pullorum (n = 3)
and Salmonella enterica subspecies II (n = 2) were identiﬁed in 1-day-
old chickens. Paratyphi B, Arachavelata, Detmold, Hessarek, Mapo,
Schwarzengrund and Waedenswil were identiﬁed in 7-week-old
chickens. Salmonella Indiana were commonly found in 7-week-old
chickens (14/12, 100% in 2009 and 31/44, 70.5% in 2012) and 6-week-
old ducks (13/44, 29.5% in 2012). The Salmonella Cremieu were
more commonly recovered from ducks (24/25, 96%) than chickens
(1/25, 4%). Salmonella Typhimurium were found in both ducks (3/9,
33.3% in 2009 and 6/9, 66.7% in 2012) and pigs (6/9, 66.7% and 3/9,
33.3% in 2012), whilst the Derby serovar was only isolated from
pigs (29/29, 100% in 2009).

3.3. Antibiotic resistance in Salmonella

A total of 99.1% of the Salmonella isolates in this study were resistant
to at least one antibiotic. Resistance was most frequently observed to

nalidixic acid (81.4%), sulphafurazole (29.6%) and trimethoprim/
sulphamethoxazole (19.8%), whilst ciproﬂoxacin (4.4%) had the lowest
resistance rate in 2009. The overall resistance rates in 2012 were signif-
icantly higher than that in 2009 (P b 0.01). The highest resistance was
to nalidixic acid (95.9%), followed by sulphafurazole (78.2%) and ampi-
cillin (72.3%). The lowest resistance was observed against amikacin
(38.1%) (Table 3). When antibiotic resistance was analysed by animal
species, a signiﬁcant increase in the resistance rates for the majority of
the agents tested was observed in Salmonella of chicken and duck origins
in 2012, compared with that in 2009 (P b 0.01). Salmonella isolates of
duck origin only showed high resistance rates to sulphafurazole (92.9%),
and showed low resistance rates to trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole
(3.6%), whilst remaining susceptible to the other 13 antibiotics in 2009.
However, the overall resistance rate for samples of duck origin increased
in 2012 (Table 3). For Salmonella of chicken origin, 100% resistance was
observed to nalidixic acid, whilst resistance to other agents was relatively
low (range: 6.1% to 19.3%) in 2009. Three years later, the resistance rates
for all of the other antibiotics tested were signiﬁcantly higher (P b 0.01),
with the exception of nalidixic acid, which retained its 100% resistance
rate. Among Salmonella isolated from pigs in 2009, resistance was com-
monly observed to tetracycline (78.7%), sulphonamides (76.6%), strepto-
mycin (42.6%) and chloramphenicol (36.2%). Because the number of
Salmonella isolates from pigs in 2012 was limited (n = 3), a comparison
of Salmonella of swine origin over the 2-year period was not performed.
As shown in Tables 4 and 5, the Salmonella serovars showed strong
relationships with antibiotic resistance. The most susceptible serovar
was Cremieu, which was susceptible to 14 antibiotics; the MIC
values to ciproﬂoxacin were 0.015 μg/ml. Derby isolates were
most likely to be resistant to tetracycline (100%), sulphafurazole
(93.1%), trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (65.5%) and streptomy-
cin (62.1%), and the MIC values to ciproﬂoxacin were ≤ 0.03 μg/ml.
All nine Salmonella Typhimurium isolates from pigs displayed resis-
tance to tetracycline, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ﬂorfenicol,
kanamycin, sulphafurazole and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole;
seven of these nine Typhimurium isolates were additionally resistant
to chloramphenicol, streptomycin and gentamicin. However, those
Typhimurium isolates recovered from ducks were susceptible to over
13 of the antibiotics tested. Multidrug resistance was particularly high
in the Indiana isolates. All 58 Indiana isolates were resistant to at least
10 antibiotics (including ciproﬂoxacin and ceftiofur). The Salmonella
Enteritidis isolates exhibited high resistance to nalidixic acid (100%),
and to a lesser extent, to ﬂorfenicol (14.4% in 2009 and 43.7% in
2012), sulphafurazole (8.7% in 2009 and 76.1%) and ampicillin (7.4%
in 2009 and 59.2% in 2012). No Salmonella Enteritidis was resistant to
ciproﬂoxacin or ceftiofur in 2009. In 2012, 14.1% (10/71) and 16.9%
(12/71) Enteritidis isolates were resistant to ceftiofur and ciproﬂoxacin,
respectively. It is noticeable that although only 2.8% (2/71) of Salmonella
Enteritidis were resistant to both ciproﬂoxacin and ceftiofur in 2012,
99.3% of (298/300) Salmonella Enteritidis in the two isolation years
showed MIC vales ≥ 0.125 μg/ml to ciproﬂoxacin.

Other unusual serovars in 2012; Schwarzengrund, Arachavelata,
Westafrica, Fortune, S. enterica subspecies II and Treguier, showed resis-
tance to ceftiofur. Furthermore, S. enterica subspecies II and Salmonella
Schwarzengrund were resistant to both ciproﬂoxacin and ceftiofur.
The increased number of multiresistant Indiana, Enteritidis and rare
serovars isolated in 2012 accounted for the overall resistance of cipro-
ﬂoxacin and ceftiofur.

3.4. Genetic relatedness in Salmonella isolates

As shown in Fig. 1, all of the PFGE patterns of the Enteritidis isolates
tested here had similarity scores above 90%. About six PFGE patterns
were observed for Salmonella Enteritidis. One pattern predominated
and comprised at least 64% of the Salmonella Enteritidis isolates
analysed. The Enteritidis isolates were from different animal origins

phenotypes in 2009 and 2012.

Salmonella Indiana strains isolated in the same year and from the
same animal species showed the closest genetic relatedness. Using a
cutoff value of 91%, three PFGE clusters were found. Two clusters of
Indiana isolated from chickens and ducks in 2012 showed 82% similar-
ity. Overall, the similarity of the PFGE patterns of the Indiana strains be-
tween 2009 and 2012 was about 78% (Fig. 2). Salmonella Typhimurium
isolates showed eight patterns and four clusters using a cutoff value of
94% similarity (Fig. 3). Isolates in each cluster showed similar resistance
phenotypes. The ﬁrst cluster contained seven Typhimurium isolates of
swine origin from two Chinese cities in 2009 and 2012. Those seven iso-
lates were resistant to10 antibiotics and had the same resistance pheno-
type (TET/AMP/AMC/STR/KAN/NAD/CHL/FFC/SIZ/SXT). The Salmonella
Derby isolates could be assigned to six different PFGE patterns (Fig. 4),
and 77% of these isolates shared the most common PFGE pattern. For
Salmonella Derby, using a cutoff value of 96% similarity, three clusters
and one individual type were observed. Derby isolates in each PFGE
cluster shared similar resistance proﬁles. In contrast, all of the Cremieu
isolates belonged to one PFGE cluster (N95% similarity), consistent with
the high similarity of the resistance proﬁles of Cremieu isolates (Fig. 5).
The PFGE proﬁles of Enteritidis, Indiana and Typhimurium isolated from
the carcasses of chicken or duck showed similar molecular “ﬁnger

prints” with the Salmonella isolated from caecal contents from the
same abattoir (Figs. 1–3).

4. Discussion

In this study, we collected samples from chickens (at different stages
of growth), ducks and pigs in eight cities in the Shandong province of
China. The samples were tested for the presence of Salmonella and to
characterise the Salmonella serotype distribution, genetic relatedness
and variation in antibiotic resistance over 2 years (2009 and 2012).
The average Salmonella-positive rate in 7-week-old chickens (7.5%) in
Shandong was in accordance with that in Europe (8%) (Jong et al.,
2009). Limited epidemiological data are available for Salmonella in
ducks. In our study, the Salmonella isolation rate for caecal samples of
duck (12.4% in 2009 and 7.5% in 2012) was similar with that in Mekong
Delta, Vietnam (8.7%) (Tran et al., 2004). We found that the Salmonella
isolation rate for pigs (10.0% and 1.3%) was lower than the isolation rate
in Sichuan province of China (16.4%) (Li et al., 2013), whilst consistent
with the low isolation rate in Thailand (3%) (Pulsrikarn et al., 2012).
The Salmonella contamination rate for chicken carcasses (13.9%) is
lower than the contamination rates for chicken carcasses in Italy
(36.9%) (Bacci et al., 2012), and in Quebec, Canada (21.2%) (Arsenault
et al., 2007). The differences in these isolation rates might be caused

by differences in the sample types, collection methods, isolation times,
and laboratory methodology, as well as the local environmental condi-
tions. The higher Salmonella-positive rate in carcass than in caecal con-
tents in this study conﬁrmed other researchers' views that cross-
contamination occurred during processing in poultry abattoirs (Henry
et al., 2012); and highlights the importance of controlling Salmonella in-
fection along the food production chain to prevent the chicken carcass
contamination. The highest Salmonella-positive rate was observed in
1-day-old chickens, which is in accordance with Lu et al. (2011) who re-
ported that Salmonella were frequently isolated from chicken hatcheries
in China. As chicken often get Salmonella infection through contacting
the Salmonella-positive eggshells or environments, the low isolation

rate in 1-year-old broiler breeders and high Salmonella isolation rate
in 1-day-old chickens observed in the present study suggest that sanita-
tion in the chicken egg incubators was poor. Hence, in order to reduce
Salmonella infection in chickens, increased sanitation of eggshells and
egg incubators is needed in Shandong, China.

Salmonella Enteritidis was dominant in chicken hatcheries and
breeding farms in this study. Fewer samples were collected from chicken
hatcheries in 2012 than in 2009, resulting in an overall decrease in
the number of Salmonella Enteritidis isolated. The ﬁnding that
Enteritidis was the most common serovar in chickens is in accordance
with some reports (Bangtrakulnonth et al., 2004; Van Duijkeren et al.,
2002). Serotyping and PFGE analysis revealed a highly similar genetic

background for Enteritidis isolates from breeding farms, hatcheries and
abattoirs in Shandong. The ﬁnding that the Enteritidis isolated from pigs
was the same clone as that found in chickens suggests that this clone
has adaptability to different types of food-producing animals. Enteritidis
is a serovar frequently identiﬁed in other studies, and is one of the most

common serovars that cause human salmonellosis (Thai et al., 2012).
For food safety reasons, preventing the dissemination of Salmonella
Enteritidis in food-producing animals is necessary. In one study,
Salmonella Indiana was mostly found in poultry and was reported
to be the causative agent of a salmonellosis outbreak in humans (Price

and Carter, 1967). In the present study, we showed that Salmonella
Indiana was prevalent in both study years in 7-week-old broiler chickens
and 6-week-old ducks. This is the ﬁrst report of Indiana isolated from
ducks used for food in mainland China. Data on the serovar Cremieu is
rare; it is not commonly found across the globe. To the best of our knowl-
edge, the 25 Cremieu isolates were the ﬁrst reported serovar Cremieu
isolated from ducks. Typhimurium was isolated from duck and pig
farms in both sampling years, and, as found by other researchers, this
serovar was readily isolated from pigs and ducks (Adzitey et al., 2012;
Jong et al., 2009). However, we did not identify Typhimurium in chickens,
a result that differs from studies conducted in many other countries
(Lammerding et al., 1988; Van Duijkeren et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2010).
In 2012, we found that the overall antibiotic resistance levels were
higher than those in 2009. This suggests that the long-term use of anti-
biotics in animal husbandry exerted a selection pressure on bacteria,
thus making it easier for antibiotic-resistant Salmonella strains to
survive. We found that the Salmonella sampled in this study were highly
resistant to nalidixic acid and, to a lesser extent, to sulphonamides,
ampicillin, tetracycline, ﬂorfenicol, gentamicin and streptomycin. The
high resistance to sulphonamides, tetracycline, ﬂorfenicol and gentami-
cin observed in the present study was probably due to the use of antibi-
otic agents, which are incorporated into animal feed and which are
present at therapeutic or sub-therapeutic levels to prevent bacteriosis
or to promote animal growth. In 2006, the European Union withdrew ap-
proval for the use of antibiotics as growth promoters, over concerns about
development of antibiotic resistance and transference of antibiotic resis-
tance genes from animals to humans (Castanon, 2007). However, antibi-
otics are still widely used in food-producing animals in China. Ampicillin
and streptomycin are commonly used to treat infectious diseases in
veterinary practice. These drugs are inexpensive and easy to obtain;
hence, high resistance to these particular antibiotics is not hard to ex-
plain. Resistance to ceftiofur was 4.7% in 2009 and 42.2% in 2012; these
values are higher than those recorded for ceftiofur resistance in food of
animal origins in Vietnam (0.0%) (Thai et al., 2012), and ceftiofur resis-
tance in human clinical Salmonella isolates in Henan province of China
(2%) (Xia et al., 2008). Ceftiofur is a third-generation cephalosporin
approved for use in animal agriculture in China, and has the potential to
be selected for resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (Singer
et al., 2008). Ceftriaxone is often used to treat children with Salmonella
infections (Douris et al., 2008). Due to similar or identical resistance
mechanisms, cross-resistance between ceftiofur and ceftriaxone is com-
mon. Thus, the increased rate of ceftiofur-resistant Salmonella of animal
origin has important public health implications. Nalidixic acid was one
of the ﬁrst generations of quinolones, and bacteria rapidly developed re-
sistance to it. We found that the resistance rate to nalidixic acid (81.4%,
2009 and 95.9%, 2012; Table 3) was much higher than the resistance
rate in Europe (≤10%) (Jong et al., 2009). Ciproﬂoxacin is a recognised
ﬁrst-line drug for the treatment of invasive salmonellosis in adults
(Threlfall et al., 1999), and the reduced susceptibility to it detected in
our study might be associated with the overuse of ciproﬂoxacin or use
of enroﬂoxacin in food-producing animals. The structure of enroﬂoxacin
is similar to ciproﬂoxacin and has a similar antibiotic spectrum. Because
of its excellent bactericidal action on Gram negative and positive bacteria,
enroﬂoxacin has been widely used in intensive farms in China in recent
years. Moreover, we found that isolates resistant to ciproﬂoxacin
were multidrug resistant strains (i.e., they were resistant to at least ﬁve
antibiotics), which was in agreement with other studies (Vo et al., 2006).
Ninety-eight percent of Salmonella isolates in the current study were
resistant to at least one antibiotic. This rate is much higher than the mul-
tidrug resistance reported in Vietnam (78.4%) and the Shaanxi province
of China (21%) (Thai et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2010). The surveillance data
from 2009 and 2012 showed a dramatic increase in the number of
Salmonella strains that were resistant to four or more antibiotics
(10.4%, 2009; 80.3%, 2012). The increase in antibiotic resistance in
Enteritidis from chicken and multidrug-resistant Indiana isolated from
ducks contributed to the signiﬁcant increase in resistance. Unlike

other common serovars, Enteritidis is typically susceptible to most anti-
biotics (Mølbak et al., 2002). In 2009, Enteritidis remained sensitive
to most antibiotics (no isolate was resistant to ≥4 antibiotics) in Shan-
dong. However, in 2012, 73.2% of the Enteritidis isolates were resistant
to ≥4 antibiotics, whilst 25.3% were resistant to ≥10 antibiotics. Notice-
ably, most of the Enteritidis strains in 2012 were isolated from the same
hatcheries or breeding farms as those in 2009, and all of them shared
similar “molecular ﬁngerprints”. Multidrug resistance in Indiana was
the most serious (100% resistance to ≥10 antibiotics) among the
serovars isolated in this study. This multidrug resistance phenotype
was similar to the phenotype of clinical Indiana isolates in the
Henan province of China (i.e., it was resistant to at least 11 antibiotic
agents) (Xia et al., 2008). Seven out of nine Typhimurium isolates of
swine origin were resistant to at least 10 antibiotic agents. The com-
mon resistance phenotype (ampicillin/chloramphenicol/streptomy-
cin/sulphafurazole/tetracycline) was similar to the phenotype of
other Typhimurium isolates in other countries (Cruchaga et al.,
2001; Mezali and Hamdi, 2012).

In summary, this study has shown that the Salmonella serotype dis-
tribution in Shandong is closely related with food-producing animal
species, and the isolation rates and serotype distribution differed from
other countries. Enteritidis was the dominant serotype in chickens.
Derby and Typhimurium were the most common serovars found in
pigs. Cremieu, Indiana and Typhimurium were the major serovars in
ducks. Each serovar had one dominant PFGE cluster. Our results were
consistent with the idea that cross-contamination occurred during
poultry slaughter. Antibiotic resistance rates for Salmonella in 2012
were much higher than those in 2009, and the resistance phenotype
was associated with particular serotypes and animal hosts. As antibiotic
resistance in food-producing animals increases, there is a risk that it
might be transferred to humans through the food chain and lead to
clinical antibiotic chemotherapy failure. Therefore, it is necessary
to plan intervention strategies to control the spread of antibiotic-
resistant Salmonella, and appropriately manage the use of antibiotics
in animal husbandry to prevent the further development and spread
of antibiotic resistance and protect food safety.
