A total of 471 duck and goose intestinal content samples were collected from wet markets and were
determined for the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. For the detected isolates, resistance to selected
antimicrobial agents was identiÔ¨Åed. Campylobacter spp. was detected in 114/291 duck samples (39.2%)
and 47/180 goose samples (26.1%). Among the 161 isolated Campylobacter spp., 85.7% and 14.3% were
Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, respectively. Resistance to ciproÔ¨Çoxacin (82.6%), tetracycline
(77%) and nalidixic acid (75.2%) was particularly high in the tested Campylobacter isolates. However, all
isolates were susceptible to gentamicin, neomycin, streptomycin, neomycin and ampicillin. The presence
of Campylobacter spp., as well as the detection of multidrug-resistant isolates in this study, indicates that
consuming of duck and goose meat might be a potential campylobacteriosis risk in this region.

1. Introduction

Campylobacter is an important pathogen that causes sporadic
human foodborne illness and economic losses globally. Isolating of
Campylobacter from the gastrointestinal tract of poultry and pigs in
previous studies showed that these animals can be reservoirs for
the pathogen (Allen et al., 2007; Oosterom, De Wilde, De Boer, De
Blaauw, & Karman, 1983). The two signiÔ¨Åcant types of Campylo-
bacter species associated with serious health problems in humans
are Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli (Wesley et al.,
2000).

The occurrence of antimicrobial-resistant foodborne pathogens
is an emerging issue in both human and veterinary medicine. This
is due to the over-dependency of antimicrobial agents that cause
the emergence, selection and spread of antimicrobial resistance
among pathogenic bacteria (Sayah, Kaneene, Johnson, & Miller,
2005).

The

development

of

Campylobacter spp. is a serious issue, described in several studies as
a problem to public health. The problem arises from the indis-
criminate application of antimicrobials in animal products, which
leads to the spread of antimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter iso-
lates (Adzitey, Rusul, Huda, Cogan, & Corry, 2012; Silva et al., 2011).
One of the major sources of Campylobacter infection is contami-
nated poultry meat, and therefore applying strategies to reduce
Campylobacter in the host would assist with the reduction of
Campylobacter-associated incidences (Janssen et al., 2008; Riazi
et al., 2013).

The objectives of the current study were to investigate the
prevalence of Campylobacter spp. and their susceptibility to
selected antimicrobials in duck and goose intestinal content sam-
ples in Varamin, Tehran Province, Iran.

Between November 2008 and July 2010, 291 duck and 180 goose
intestinal content samples were sampled from wet markets in
Varamin, Tehran Province, Iran. The samples were transferred into
sterile plastic bags and transported in icebox to the laboratory
within 3 h of sampling.

Isolation and identiÔ¨Åcation of Campylobacter spp.

Campylobacter spp. isolation was carried out following by ISO
10272-1 (ISO, 2006). BrieÔ¨Çy, 25 g of each intestinal content
sample was weighted and mixed with 225 ml of Preston broth
(Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) and incubated for 24e48 h at 42 C
under anaerobic condition using commercial gas packs (Oxoid
Campygen) in microaerophilic atmosphere. The enrichment broth
was then streaked on Preston agar as selective medium and
incubated at 42 C in jar for 48 h. Several presumptive Campylo-
bacter colonies were picked from each plate and subjected to
biochemical tests. Finally, the API Campy identiÔ¨Åcation system
(Biomerieux) was used to identify and differentiate of
the
Campylobacter species.

2.3. Antimicrobial susceptibility test

Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the KirbyeBa-
uer disc diffusion method with Mueller Hinton agar (Oxoid,
Basingstoke, UK) supplemented with 5% horse blood (Oxoid,
Basingstoke, UK) (CLSI, 2006, 2008). Amoxicillin (30 mg), ampicillin
(30 mg), nalidixic acid (30 mg), chloramphenicol (30 mg), ciproÔ¨Çox-
acin (5 mg), colistin (10 mg), erythromycin (15 mg), gentamicin
(10 mg), neomycin (30 mg), streptomycin (30 mg) and tetracycline
(15 mg) were used as antimicrobial agents in this study.

2.4. Statistical analysis

Chi-square analysis was carried out to investigate the relation-
ship between different kinds of normal and contaminated samples.
SPSS 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was applied for all statistical
and chi-square analyses. A P value of <0.05 was employed for sta-
tistical signiÔ¨Åcance.

The Campylobacter spp. prevalence rates in duck and goose in-
testinal content samples are summarized in Table 1. Overall, 161
samples (34.2%) were contaminated with Campylobacter spp. in this
study. The pathogen was isolated in 39.2% and 26.1% of duck and
goose samples, respectively. C. jejuni (85.7%) was the most preva-
lent Campylobacter spp.
isolated from the samples and the
remaining serovar was C. coli (14.3%).

The antimicrobial resistance proÔ¨Åles for 138 C. jejuni and 23 C.
coli isolates are presented in Table 2. Out of 161 Campylobacter
isolates, 156 (96.9%) demonstrated resistance to one or more anti-
microbial agents. Twenty (12.4%) and 39 (24.2%) isolates showed
resistance to only one and two antimicrobial agents, respectively.
Moreover, 97 isolates (60.2%) were multidrug-resistant (to three or
more antimicrobial agents). The isolates were resistant to cipro-
Ô¨Çoxacin (86.8%), tetracycline (75.4%) and nalidixic acid (74.6%). All
Campylobacter isolates were sensitive to gentamicin. However, all
C. coli isolates were also susceptible to chloramphenicol. C. coli
isolates were generally more susceptible to antimicrobial agents
than C. jejuni isolates.

4. Discussion

According to the Ô¨Åndings,

there was high prevalence of
Campylobacter spp. in duck (39.2%) and goose (26.1%) intestinal
content; however, there was no signiÔ¨Åcant difference between
duck and goose samples. Poultry intestinal tract is considered a
favorable environment for Campylobacter colonization (Mirzaie,
Hassanzadeh, Bashashati, & Barrin, 2011). Poultry meat contami-
nation by foodborne pathogens may occur during carcass pro-
cessing (Rahimi & Ameri, 2011) and pose public health risks.

The results indicate that Campylobacter spp. is highly prevalence
in duck and goose, which is similar to earlier Ô¨Åndings regarding duck
and goose samples in Iran (Rahimi, Alian, & Alian, 2011). However,
the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in duck samples in the current
study was less than previous reports from the UK (Colles, Ali,
Sheppard, McCarthy, & Maiden, 2011), Malaysia (Adzitey et al.,
2012), Taiwan (Tsai & Hsiang, 2005), Tanzania (Nonga &
Muhairwa, 2010) and Nigeria (Akwuobu & Ofukwu, 2010). None-
theless, McCrea et al. (2006) reported a higher percentage of
contaminated duck samples in the USA. The differences among re-
sults might be due to diverse sampling techniques, geographic and

seasonal effects (Willis & Murray, 1997) as well as laboratory tech-
niques employed in each study (Rahimi & Ameri, 2011).

The most predominate serovar was C. jejuni, which has been
reported in food of animal origin especially poultry meat (Adzitey
et al., 2012; Colles et al., 2011; Nonga & Muhairwa, 2010; Tsai &
Hsiang, 2005; Whyte et al., 2004), whereas C. coli was predomi-
nant in pigs (Rosef, Gondrosen, Kapperud, & Underdal, 1983;
Thakur & Gebreyes, 2005).

Our results are in agreement with earlier studies (Little,
Richardson, Owen, De Pinna, & Threlfall, 2008; Rahimi & Ameri,
2011; Soltan Dallal et al., 2010; Zendehbad, Arian, & Alipour,
2013), which reported a high prevalence of Campylobacter resis-
tant to quinolones (nalidixic acid), Ô¨Çuoroquinolones (ciproÔ¨Çoxacin),
and tetracyclines (tetracycline) among duck and goose samples.
The high prevalence of ciproÔ¨Çoxacin- and tetracycline-resistant
isolates in the current study and past Ô¨Åndings in Iran (Rahimi &
Ameri, 2011; Soltan Dallal et al., 2010; Zendehbad et al., 2013)
could be attributable to the widespread use of these antimicrobial
agents in the last decades for the treatment, control and prevention
of poultry diseases (Mirzaie et al., 2011; Rahimi & Ameri, 2011).
Therefore, using antimicrobial agents in poultry rearing may lead to
the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter in treated
birds (Luangtongkum et al., 2009).

All Campylobacter spp. were susceptible to gentamicin and the
outcome was similar to other reported studies (Chen et al., 2010;
Rahimi et al., 2011; Rahimi & Ameri, 2011; Soltan Dallal et al.,
2010; Zendehbad et al., 2013). The low levels of gentamicin-
resistant isolates detected are potentially owing to less use of this
antimicrobial agent in duck and goose rearing. In the present study,
29.2% and 3.7% of Campylobacter isolates were resistant to amoxi-
cillin (beta-lactam) and erythromycin (macrolide), respectively.
However, all tested Campylobacter isolates were susceptible to
amoxicillin and erythromycin in earlier Ô¨Åndings on duck and goose
samples in Iran (Rahimi et al., 2011). Furthermore, our results
illustrate high levels of multidrug resistance among the isolated
Campylobacter spp. The presence of multidrug-resistant isolates
could be a signiÔ¨Åcant threat to human health as the types of
effective antibiotics become limited (Chen et al., 2010; Han, Jang,
Choo, Heu, & Ryu, 2007; Rahimi & Ameri, 2011; Zendehbad et al.,
2013).

In summary, the presence of Campylobacter spp. and detection
of multidrug-resistant isolates in duck and goose intestinal content
in this study indicate that consuming these types of meat is a po-
tential public health risk regarding foodborne campylobacteriosis.
The surveillance of Campylobacter spp. and stringent monitoring of
antimicrobial agent usage in poultry rearing would reduce the risk
of meat contamination and development of antibiotic-resistant
isolates.
