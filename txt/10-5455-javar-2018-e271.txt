ABSTRACT 
 
Objective:  Shiga-toxin  producing Escherichia  coli (STEC)  is  the  most  important 
foodborne bacterial pathogen worldwide and the bovine animals are assumed as a 
reservoir of this pathogen. The present study was conducted to assess the role of 
bovine animals as the source of STEC. 
Materials  and  methods: To  assess  the role  of  bovine animals  as  the source  of 
STEC, we examined 100 samples (50 rectal swab and 50 beef samples) collected 
from the local beef slaughterhouses by cultural, morphological, biochemical tests 
and  polymerase  chain  reaction.  Finally,  the  drug  resistance  pattern  of  isolated 
organisms has been examined.  
Result:  In  the  preliminary  screening  by  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR),  E. 
coli was  more  prevalent  in  rectal  swab  (n=21/50)  than  beef  samples  (n=16/50). 
Among 39 isolated E. coli, 10 isolates were confirmed as STEC (Rectal swab=7, 
Beef=3)  by  PCR,  where stx2 gene  (n=7/10)  was  predominant  than stx1 gene 
(n=3/10). Remaining 29 isolates did not react to stx primers in PCR. Presence of 
STEC in beef samples was significantly associated with the fecal contamination at 
P≤0.1  (0.074818)  in  Pearson’s  correlation  coefficient  method.  In  addition,  most 
of  the  isolated STEC  strains  were  resistant  to  one  or  more  commonly  used 
antimicrobials in the country.  
Conclusion: The bovine animals and its products could be an important source 
of multidrug-resistant STEC in the country.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Escherichia  coli  is  considered  as  the  normal  inhabitant  of 
the  gut  microflora 
in  the 
exhausted  or  immunosuppressed  host,  nonpathogenic 
strains  of  E.  coli  can  cause  serious  illness  including 
diarrhea  (Duriez  et  al.,  2001;  Hilbert  et  al.,  2008). 
Diarrheal illness is the causes of about 12600 deaths daily 
in children under 5 years of age in Asia, Africa and Latin 
America  (Nguyen  et  al.,  2006).  Diarrheagenic  E.  coli 
(DEC)  is  the  leading  cause  of  foodborne  diarrhea  in 
developed  as  well  as  developing  countries    and  this 
pathogen  is  an  important  etiology  of  morbidity  and 
mortality worldwide (Mohammed et al., 2002).  
 
In Bangladesh, about 34% of total diarrheal episodes are 
due  to  DEC  (icddr,b,  2002)  and  this  pathogen  might  be 
transmitted  through  foods  of  animal  origin  or  water 
contaminated  with  human  or  animal  feces.  Person-to-
person  transmission  may  also  take  place  (Nataro  and 
Kapler,  1998).  Unhygienic  practices  in  food  processing 
are  mainly  associated  with  food-borne  diseases  and 
diarrhea  (Wilfred  et  al.,  2012).  The  occurrences  are 
generally  related  to  food  of  bovine  origin,  minced  beef 
and  uncooked  fresh  milk  (Bachrouri  et  al.,  2002).  Shiga-
toxin  producing  Escherichia  coli  is  worldwide  reported 
DEC  pathotype  and  is  the  causal  agent  of  hemorrhagic 
colitis  with  some  severe  sequelae  including  hemolytic 
uremic  syndrome,  which  is  due  to  the  effect  of  Shiga-
toxin  produced  by  the  organism  that  acts  on  kidney, 
intestine and other parenchymatous organs (Gyles, 2007). 
STEC is characterized by the production of one or more 
types  of  Shiga-toxin  (stx1,  stx2  or  their  variants), 
following  cell  death  by  inhibition  of  protein  synthesis  in 
host cells (Strockbine et al., 1986). Bovine animals are the 
natural  reservoir  of  STEC  contributing  as  the  major 
source  for  human  infections  (Dorn  and  Angrick,  1991). 
The  organism  does  not  produce  any  clinical  illness  in 
their  natural  reservoir  but  it  produces  a  broad  spectrum 
including  mild 
of  clinical  abnormalities 
diarrhea, 
uremic 
syndrome,  bloody  diarrhea  and  thrombotic  thrombo-
cytopenic purpura (Fey et al., 2000).  
 
Harboring  of  STEC  in  cattle  is  a  significant  concern for 
public  health  because  of  their  transmitting  capability  to 
humans  through  contaminated  foods  and  water  with 
feces  from  cattle  (Cooley  et  al.,  2007).  Prevalence 
estimates ranging from 0.1 to 62% of E. coli in cattle was 
reported  worldwide  (Pennington,  2010).  E.  coli  O157  is 
the  best-known  STEC  pathogen  until  the  date  (Caprioli 
et al., 2005). The low infectious dose of the pathogen and

life-threatening  complication  has  made  this  organism  a 
serious  threat  to  public  health  (Akkaya  et  al.,  2006).  In 
Bangladesh,  the  predominant  pathotypes  associated  with 
childhood  diarrhea  is  enterotoxigenic  E.  coli  (ETEC) 
which  accounts  for  20%  of  all  diarrheal  cases  in  the 
country (Qadri et al., 2005). Recently, Hassan et al. (2017) 
reported  43.33%  bovine  animals  in  Bangladesh  carry 
STEC  in  feces,  which  might  be  the  source  of  STEC  in 
Human.  Islam  et  al.  (2007)  reported  0.5%  prevalence  of 
STEC among the hospitalized patients in Bangladesh and 
1.9% among community patients. Routine monitoring of 
the  slaughterhouses  is  crucial  to  producing  safe  food,  as 
the  animals  are  the  potential  source  of  the  foodborne 
pathogen. Hence, the study was executed to elucidate the 
present status of STEC in local slaughterhouses and their 
drug-resistant  pattern  was 
investigated  to  find  out 
whether  the  beef  and  its  product  could  be  a  source  of 
drug-resistant STEC. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Sample  collection:  We  collected  50  rectal  swabs  from 
the 
cattle 
animals were slaughtered 
convenience 
sampling  method  without  repetition  of  animals.  Sterile 
cotton  buds  were  used  for  the  collection  of  swab 
samples,  and  the  swab  was  transferred  to  nutrient  broth 
instantly.  Meat  samples (n=50) approximately  weighing 
50  gm  were  collected  from  the  same  slaughtered 
animal in  sterile  polyethylene  sachets. The  samples  were 
transported on ice and processed immediately (within one 
hour). 
  
Cultural and biochemical examinations: The nutrient 
broth  containing  swab  samples  have  been  incubated 
overnight  at  37°C.  After  overnight  incubation,  enriched 
samples  from  the  nutrient  broth  were  cultured  on  to 
EMB  agar,  and  characteristics E.  coli suspected  colonies 
were  subcultured  onto  MacConkey  agar  to  obtain  pure 
bacterial  colony  (Zadik et  al.,  1993). Isolation  of E.  coli 
from  beef  samples was  performed  as  per  the  method 
described  in  BAM  (1998).  A  quantity  of  10  gm  of  the 
beef  sample  was  minced  with  the  help of sterile scissors 
and  mixed  in  90  mL  normal  saline  solution  (pH  7.2)  in 
screw cap bottle. Ten-fold serial dilutions were made up 
to 10-5 dilution  in  normal  saline  solution.  A  quantity  of 
0.1  mL  inoculum  from 10-3 and 10-4 dilutions  have  been 
cultured  by  spread  plate  technique  on  Eosin  Methylene 
Blue agar (EMB) (Himedia, India) following incubation at 
37°C for 24 h. Typical characteristics colony of E. coli on 
EMB agar as greenish metallic sheen was enumerated and 
isolated. Isolated  organisms  with  supporting  growth

the 
procedure mentioned by Cheesbrough (1985).  
  
DNA extraction: Bacterial DNA has been isolated using 
the  method  described  by  Queipo-Ortun et  al. (2008). 
One  mL  of  broth  culture  was  centrifuged  at  10000  rpm 
for  3  min;  pellets  were  collected  and  mixed  in  500  μL 
water  by  pipetting,  boiled  for  10  min  followed  by 
centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant 
was collected and used as template in PCR. 
 
PCR  to  detect 16S rRNA, stx1,  and stx2 gene:  The 
isolated  organisms  that  were  cultural,  morphologically 
and biochemically identified as E. coli were confirmed by 
PCR  using  genus-specific  primers  to  detect E.  coli 16S 
rRNA gene (Table-1). PCR was performed based on the 
scheme by Schippa et al. (2010). Briefly, 25 μL reactions 
contained  12.5  μL  of  2X  PCR  master  mix  (Promega, 
USA),  1  μL  of  each  primer  (10  pmol/μL),  2  μL  of 
template  DNA  and  8.5  μL  of  nuclease-free  water.  PCR 
amplification  was  performed  on  a 
thermocycler 
(Eppendorf Personal, Germany) with an initial incubation 
at 95°C for 3 min, a 30-cycle amplification of 94°C for 45 
seconds, 58°C for 45 Sec and 72°C for 60 Sec and a final 
extension  of  72°C  for  3  min.  The  thermal  condition  to 
detect STEC gene was an initial denaturation of 94°C for 
5  min,  a  30-cycle  amplification  of  94°C  for  1 min,  58°C 
for 1 min (59°C for stx2) and 72°C for 2 min and a final 
extension  of  72°C  for  5  min.  The  amplified  products 
were resolved in 1.5% agarose gel, electrophoresed at 60 
volts for 1 h (Sambrook and Russel, 2001) and examined 
under UV transilluminator using the 100-bp DNA ladder 
(Promega, USA) after stained with ethidium bromide.  
 
Antibiotic  sensitivity  test:  Antibiotic  sensitivity  test  of 
isolated E.  coli has  been  performed  with  standardized 
commercial  antibiotic  discs  (Oxoid,  UK)  following  Disc 
Diffusion  Method  (Bauer et  al.,  1966).  Sensitivity  to 
antibiotics  were  studied  on  Muller  Hinton  agar  plates 
(CIP)  5  µg, 
(Himedia,  India)  with  ciprofloxacin 
Amoxycillin 
(AM)  10 

(AMX)  30  µg,  ampicillin 

ug,  tetracycline  (Te)  30  µg,  gentamicin  (GM)  10  µg, 
nalidixic acid (NA) 30 µg, chloramphenicol (C) 30 µg and 
ceftriaxone  (CRO)  30  µg. An  amount  of  0.1  mL  freshly 
grown  pure  culture  of E.  coli in  nutrient  broth (Turbidity 
was compared with 0.5 McFarland standards) was poured 
on  agar  plates  and  allowed  to  spread  gently  over  the 
entire surface with a glass rod spreader. After 5 min, the 
discs  were  placed  at  a  distance  of  about  1  cm  apart  and 
incubated  at  37°C  for  overnight.  Based  on  the  diameter 
of  zones  of  inhibition  produced  around  the  antibiotic 
discs the inhibitory effect of the antibiotic on the growth 
of  the  culture  was  documented  and  evaluated  according 
to CLSI (2015). 
  
Statistical  analysis:  The  correlation  among 
the 
pathogens  in  fecal  samples  and  beef  samples  were 
analyzed by Pearson correlation coefficient method using 
the R version 3.4.4 
  
RESULTS  
 
Detection  of  E.  coli:  In  the  present  study,  42% 
(n=21/50) rectal swab and 32% (n=16/50) beef samples 
harbored E. 
isolates  upon  overnight 
incubation  at  37°C  produced  greenish black  colored 
colonies  with  a  characteristic  metallic  sheen  on 
EMB agar, large bright pink colored colonies with lactose 
fermentation  on  MacConkey  agar.  E.  coli  suspected 
isolates  were  confirmed by  detecting 16S  rRNA gene 
amplified  at  585-bp 
in PCR  (Figure  1)  using  the 
primers ECO-1  and  ECO-2  (Hassan et  al.,  2014). Presence 
of E. coli in beef is positively correlated with the presence 
of E.  coli in  rectal  swab  (R=0.8402)  in  each  of  the  five 
slaughterhouses and the result is statistically significant at 
P≤0.1  (P-value  is  0.074818)  in  Pearson’s  Correlation 
Coefficient (Table 2; Figure 1). 
   
Detection  of  STEC:  Among  the  sample  tested,  14% 
(n=7/50)  rectal  swab  and  6%  (n=3/50)  beef  samples 
having Shiga-toxin producing E. coli respectively. The stx1 
gene was amplified in three samples (Figure 2) and stx2 
gene was in seven samples (Figure 3) at 606-bp and 372-
bp, respectively (Talukdar et al., 2013).

Antibiotic  sensitivity  test:  Antibiotic  sensitivity  test 
against  ten  commonly  used  antibiotics  in  the  country 
revealed  that  most  of  the  isolated  STEC  strains  were 
multidrug  resistant  against  one  or  more  antibiotics.  The 
strains  having stx2 gene  exhibited  more  drug  resistance 
pattern than the strains harbored stx1 gene (Table 2).   
 
DISCUSSION 
 
E. coli is the most common foodborne bacterial pathogen 
in humans and has been isolated from cattle at all stages

relationship.  The 

lower 
close  and  unique  clonal 
prevalence  of stx1  gene  in  compared  to  stx2  may  have 
been  caused  by  instability  of  the  phages  carrying  stx1 
genes.  Loss  of stx genes  in  serial  cultures  is  seen  after 
long  storage/culturing  of  the  organism  (Karch et  al., 
1999). At  present,  there  are  no  data  available  on  the 
outbreak  of  HUS  and  therefore  the  burden  of  STEC-
associated  HUS  in  Bangladesh  is  not  elucidated  yet.  In 
order to evaluate the total burden of HUS in Bangladesh, 
it  is  recommended  to  perform  a  prospective  study 
comprising all tertiary-level hospitals and some randomly 
selected  secondary-level  hospitals.  All  HUS  cases 
admitted  to  these  hospitals  should  be  counted  in  the 
study.  Stool  samples  should  be  tested  for  the  existence 
of stx  genes  and  STEC  organisms 
together  with 
serogroup O157. 
  
Antimicrobial  resistance  has  clearly  inexorable  alarming 
levels in human pathogens, but some fears have also been 
elevated  concerning  pathogens  and  commensals  from 
animals  (Catry  et  al.,  2003). Multiple  drug  resistance 
was detected  in  all  the  STEC tested  in  this  study.  The 
worldwide overuse or misuse of antimicrobials in diverse 
fields,  comprising  human  medicine  and  veterinary 
medicine  as  prophylactic  supplements  or  growth-
promoting  agents  in  the  feed  of  food  animals, has 
produced  antimicrobial 
resistance  among  bacterial 
pathogens  and endogenous  microflora (WHO,  2000). 
The  purpose  of  antimicrobial  susceptibility  of  clinical 
isolates  and  surveillance  for  resistant  pathogens  is often 
vital  for  the  optimal  antimicrobial  therapy  of  infected 
patients.  This  need  is  becoming  a  more  burning  issue 
with increasing 
the  emergence  of 
multidrug-resistant  microorganisms (Fluit et  al.,  2000). 
The  findings  of  the  present  study  ascertain  that  these 
organisms  have  been  developed  resistance  for  routinely 
prescribed antimicrobial  drugs  and  pose  considerable 
health  hazards 
the  consumers  unless  prudent 
control measures  are  established.  The  isolation  of  this 
pathogen recommends that contaminated meat and meat 
products  are  sold  to consumers  and  thus  exposing  them 
to foodborne hazards. Furthermore, it indicates that food 
hygiene and handling practices endure a great challenge in 
a developing country like Bangladesh. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The  association  between  fecal  prevalence  of E.  coli and 
carcass  contamination  indicates  a  role  for  control  of E. 
coli in cattle on the farm to reduce and control the risk of 
human  infection  from  ingestion  of  undercooked  beef  or 
cross-contamination  of  other  foods  of  animal  origin.

of  production.  The  shedding  of  the  organisms 
is 
intermittent  and  can  be  challenging  to  detect,  although 
they  appear  to  be  extended  throughout  the  bovine 
population (Abd El-Atty and Meshref, 2007). This study 
revealed  42%  beef  cattle  in  slaughterhouses  are  the 
natural  reservoir  of E.  coli.  The  prevalence  obtained  in 
this  study  is  lower  than  our  previous  report  in  a  dairy 
farm (Hassan et al., 2014), where the prevalence of E. coli  
was 75% in apparently healthy cattle, however, Ogunleye 
et  al.  (2013)  reported  80% E.  coli from  the  apparently 
healthy  cattle  in  Nigeria.  According  to  Masud et  al. 
(2012),  the  prevalence  of E.  coli in  the  rectal  swab  of 
apparently  healthy  cattle  between  2-3  years  of  age  was 
23.21%  in  Bangladesh.  The  prevalence  varies  according 
to  geographical  location  and  types  of  bovine  animals 
sampled  in  the  study.  Detection  of stx genes  in E.  coli 
suggests  that  the  strains  are  potentially  pathogenic 
(Arthur et al., 2002).  
 
stx1 gene was detected in three isolates and stx2 in seven 
isolates  tested  by  PCR. In  a routine  diagnosis,  it  should 
be  considered  that  a  large  number  of  samples  might  be 
processed  in  a relatively  short  period  using  the  PCR 
assay (Cortez et al., 2006). We reported 43% STEC in the 
fecal  specimen  of  dairy  cattle  in  Bangladesh (Hassan  et 
al.,  2017),  while  beef  cattle have  lower  prevalence  (14%) 
of STEC in the present study. Pradel et al. (2001) isolated 
STEC  from  cattle,  food  products  and  HUS  patients  in 
France  and reported  that  that  the  strains  were  clearly 
different  tested  in  both  PFGE  and  the  combination 
of stx2-RFLP, stx2 variant,  and  plasmid  profile  analyses. 
Adwan  and  Adwan  (2004)  isolated  2.2%  multidrug-
resistant STEC from beef in Nigeria.  
 
In  Vietnam,  23%  STEC  was  reported  from  cattle

in beef cattle and 7.26% in the calf (Mannan et al., 2006). 
In  addition, Schmidt  et  al.  (1999),  reported  that STEC

into 

However, such a control program would also reduce the 
environmental contamination of E. coli, another potential 
source  of  human  infection.  Unfortunately,  farmers  in 
Bangladesh  currently  follow  no  effective  measure  to 
control  pathogens  in  cattle.  The  finding  in  this  study  is 
the  indication  of  the  poor  sanitary  environment  under 
which  animals  are  reared,  transported,  slaughtered, 
processed  and  sold.  The  report  of  the  presence  of 
STEC in beef should make the conscious among relevant 
authorities  that  most  foodborne  illnesses  may  be  due  to 
unhygienic  condition  and  mishandling  of  foods,  while 
animal-borne 
the 
environment,  lead  to  human  illness  associated  with 
consumption  of  contaminated  meat.  Therefore,  control 
strategies  of  foodborne  pathogen  and  environmental 
pollution  issues  should  be  major  targets  in  efforts  to 
improve  meat  and  food  safety  in  developing,  least 
developed and underdeveloped countries.
