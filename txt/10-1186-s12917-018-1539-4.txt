Non-typhoidal Salmonella serovars in
poultry farms in central Ethiopia:
prevalence and antimicrobial resistance

Tadesse Eguale

Abstract
Background: Poultry is one of the common sources of non-typhoidal Salmonella and poultry products are the
major sources of human infection with non-typhoidal Salmonella. In spite of flourishing poultry industry in the
country, data on prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of non-typhoidal Salmonella serovars at farm level is
not available in Ethiopia. This study investigated prevalence, serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance of
non-typhoidal Salmonella in poultry farms in Addis Ababa and its surrounding districts.
Results: A total of 549 fresh pool of fecal droppings (n = 3 each) were collected from 48 poultry farms and cultured for
Salmonella using standard laboratory technique and serotyped using slide agglutination technique. Susceptibility of
Salmonella isolates to18 antimicrobials was tested according to CLSI guideline using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion assay.
Salmonella was recovered in 7 (14.6%) of the farms and 26 (4.7%) of the samples. Salmonella was more common in
poultry farms with larger flock size than in the smaller ones and in Ada’a district as compared to other districts. All
isolates were obtained from farms containing layers. Two out of 6 (33.3%) farms that kept birds in cage were positive
for Salmonella while only 5 (11.9%) of the 42 farms who used floor system were positive. Oxytetracycline was used
widely in 40 (83.3%) of the farms, followed by amoxicillin 14 (29.2%) and sulfonamides 11 (22.9%). Salmonella Saintpaul
was the dominant serotype detected accounting for 20 (76.9%) of all isolates. Other serovars, such as S. Typhimurium3
(11.5%), S. Kentucky 2 (7.7%) and S. Haifa 1 (3.8%) were also detected. Of all the Salmonella isolates tested, 24 (92.3%)
were intermediately or fully resistant to sulfisoxazole and streptomycin, 12 (46.2%) to cephalothin, while 11 (42.3%)
were resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin+clavulanic acid, kanamycin and chloramphenicol. Multidrug resistance (MDR) to
several drugs was common in S. Kentucky and S. Saintpaul.
Conclusion: Despite low prevalence of Salmonella in poultry farms in the study area, circulation of MDR strains in
some farms warrant special biosecurity measures to hinder dissemination of these pathogens to other farms and the
public. Moreover, awareness creation on prudent use of antimicrobials is recommended.

Background
Salmonella is one of the major causes of food-borne
diseases worldwide [1]. Poultry and other food animals
are considered the common reservoirs of Salmonella
enterica and undercooked poultry products are the
major sources of human infection with non-typhoidal
Salmonella [2, 3]. Several host unrestricted S. enterica

showing any clinical signs usually infect a wider range of
hosts and cause disease in humans as well [4].

It has been shown that some of the most commonly
detected serovars in chickens in a given geographic area
are also among the top serovars associated with human
infections indicating the role of Salmonella colonization
of poultry farms to public health [5]. Knowledge on dis-
tribution of Salmonella serovars in food animals and
humans is useful to understand the trends of Salmonella
epidemiology and to identify serovars that cluster over
time and space. Temporal and spatial variation in rate

and distribution of Salmonella serovars in poultry indus-
try has been reported [2, 6].

in developing countries

Developed countries conduct routine surveillance of
Salmonella in poultry farms to understand the level
of colonization by Salmonella, serovars involved and
drug resistance profile with the aim of designing ways
of reducing public health salmonellosis of poultry ori-
gin [7, 8]. However,
like
little effort is made to monitor Salmonella
Ethiopia,
in poultry farms and information on prevalence and
serotype distribution as well as phenotypic and geno-
typic relatedness of Salmonella isolated from poultry
and humans is not well documented. Local knowledge
on prevalence of Salmonella,
serotype distribution
and associated risk factors is important to implement
appropriate control strategy to reduce wider dissemin-
ation of important zoonotic serovars [2].

There is little available literature on farm level preva-
lence and serotype distribution of non-typhoidal Sal-
monella in poultry farms in Ethiopia. Previous studies
conducted on retail raw chicken products reported
17.9% prevalence of Salmonella, the dominant serovars
being S. Braenderup (31.5%), S. Anatum (25.9%), S.
Saintpaul (14.8%) and S. Uganda (11.1%) [9]. Another
study also reported that 14% of chicken carcass from su-
permarkets in Addis Ababa were positive for Salmonella.
S. Braenderup (41.4%), S. Hadar (20.7%), S. Newprt
(13.8%) and S. Typhimurium (10.3%) were the dominant
serovars detected in poultry products in Addis Ababa
[10]. However, source of Salmonella contamination in
these poultry products could be either from farm or due
to cross contamination during slaughter, transportation
or storage. Recent study in southern Ethiopia showed
that 16.7% of samples from poultry and the environment
of three poultry farms were positive for Salmonella al-
though this study did not show whether Salmonella iso-
lates were host specific Salmonella serovars or host
unrestricted non-typhoidal Salmonella serovars [11].

Majority of the Salmonella isolates from poultry prod-
ucts and poultry farms in the previous studies were
found to be resistant to several antimicrobials. Informa-
tion on farm level prevalence and antimicrobial suscepti-
bility status of isolates can explain the level of public
health risk associated with poultry products. The aim of
this study was therefore to determine the prevalence,
serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance of sal-
monella in poultry farms in central Ethiopia. The type of
antimicrobials and disinfectants commonly employed in
poultry farms were also assessed.

Methods
Study design, study area and study animals
A cross-sectional study was conducted in Addis Ababa
and 3 districts of Oromia region located at the outskirt

of Addis Ababa from July 2013–January 2014. A total
of 549 pooled fresh fecal droppings (from 3 chicken
each) were collected in 48 farms (Ada’a district n =
33, Addis Ababa n = 6, Sebeta n = 6, Barake n = 3).
Inclusion of farms in the sampling was based on rep-
resentation of the area under study, willingness of the
owners, availability of poultry farms in the study area,
and the flock having a minimum of 50 birds. Most of
the poultry farms investigated in the current study
were those from Ada’a district due to large number of
poultry farms in this district.

Data and sample collection
Information such as type of poultry farm, whether it
is broiler or layer,
flock size, birds housing system,
age of birds, purpose and types of antimicrobials and
disinfectants commonly used in the farm during the
last 6 months were recorded using a purposively de-
signed questionnaire. Collection of data was per-
formed at the time of
fecal sample collection from
each farm. Pooled fresh fecal droppings(from 3 chick-
ens) were collected using clean disposable gloves in
to sterile zippered plastic bags which were trans-
ported to microbiology laboratory of Aklilu Lemma
Institute of Pathobiology, Addis Ababa University in
an ice box within 3–4 h of collection.

Salmonella isolation, identification, serotyping and phage
typing
Salmonella isolation and identification was carried out
using conventional methods [12, 13]. Briefly,
fresh
fecal droppings from three chicken was thoroughly
mixed of which 10 g of feces was suspended in 90 ml
of buffered peptone water (BPW) (Becton Dickinson,
Sparks, MD) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. En-
richment, culturing on selective media, and biochem-
ical analysis of presumptive Salmonella colonies was
conducted as shown previously [14]. Genus specific
PCR was used to confirm isolates suspected to be
Salmonella by biochemical
[15]. Salmonella
Typhimurium (ATCC 14028) was used as a positive
control during biochemical analysis and PCR. Con-
firmed Salmonella isolates were stored at − 80 °C in
20% glycerol till further investigation.

Serotyping and phage typing of Salmonella isolates
was conducted at the World Organization for Animal
Health (OIÉ) Reference Laboratory for salmonellosis,
Public Health Agency of Canada’s National Microbiology
at Guelph. Determination of serovars was conducted
using serum agglutination technique as shown previ-
ously [16, 17], based on identification of somatic (O) an-
tigens [18] and flagellar (H) antigens [19].

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
Isolates were investigated for susceptibility to 18 antimi-
crobials using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method ac-
cording to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
guidelines [20]. Antimicrobials used in the current study
were amikacin (30 μg), amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (20/
10 μg), ampicillin (10 μg), cefoxitin (30 μg), ceftriaxone
(30 μg), cephalothin (30 μg), chloramphenicol (30 μg),
ciprofloxacin (5 μg), gentamicin (10 μg), kanamycin
(30 μg), nalidixic acid (30 μg), neomycin (30 μg), nitro-
furantoin (100 μg), streptomycin (10 μg), sulfisoxazole
(1000 μg), sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim (23.75/
1.25 μg), trimethoprim (5 μg) and tetracycline (30 μg).
All of them were from Sensi-Discs, Becton, Dickinson
and Company, Loveton, USA. The interpretation cut off
points for susceptibility status of isolates was based on
the CLSI guidelines [20]. For the purpose of analysis, all
readings classified as intermediate were considered as
resistant unless indicated. E. coli ATCC 25922 was used
as a quality control organism.

Statistical analysis
Sample level prevalence of Salmonella was calculated as
percentage of Salmonella culture positive fecal samples
among total number of samples examined. Farm level
prevalence was calculated as the percentage of farms
with one or more Salmonella culture positive pooled
fecal sample among the total farms sampled. Association
of Salmonella detection with various factors was tested
test and p-value < 0.05 was considered
using exact
significant.

Results
Farm level Salmonella occurence with respect to various
factors
Salmonella was isolated from 14.6% (7/48) of poultry
farms with individual sample level prevalence of 4.7%
(Table 1). Salmonella was more common in poultry
farms with larger flock size and in age group of 2–
6 months (Table 2). Majority of the farms studied con-
tained layers or young pullets grown for egg production
(n = 43, 89.6%); whereas only (n = 5; 11.4%) were keeping
broilers. Salmonella was not detected from the broiler

farms. Salmonella isolation was also more common in
farms of the Ada’a district as compared to other districts.
Majority of the farms (n = 42; 87.5%) keep their birds on
floor system and 12.5% (6/48) use cage system. Out of
the farms that use cage system 33.3% (2/6) were positive
for Salmonella whereas 11.9% (5/42) of farms that use
floor system were found positive for Salmonella.

Antimicrobials used in poultry farms
Among the common antimicrobials, oxytetracycline was
used widely in 40 (83.3%) of the farms, followed by
amoxicillin (29.2%) and sulfonamides (22.9%). Other an-
timicrobials such as fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin and
ciprofloxacin), and florfenicol were also used in 11
(22.9%) and 7 (14.6%) of the farms respectively, whereas
6(12.5%) of the farms reported that they did not use any
antimicrobials during last 6 months. None of the farms
reported use of antimicrobials as feed additive. All of the
farms use antimicrobials for therapeutic or prophylactic
purposes when there is one or more sick birds in the
flock. Interestingly, in one of the poultry farms in Adaa
district, the use of human preparation of ciprofloxacin
tablet was observed. Salmonella was recovered more fre-
quently in farms which use only amoxicillin, sulfadimi-
dine and oxytetracycline than those farms which use
fluoroquinolones and florfenicol. Recent use of antimi-
crobials and occurrence of Salmonella in farms is shown
in Table 3. All samples from six farms with no history of
use of antimicrobials were also not culture positive for
Salmonella. Twenty-three (47.9%) of the farms reported
use of sodium hypochlorite disinfectant as foot bath, for
cleaning poultry houses before introduction of new stock
and to clean feeding utensils, while 4(8.3%) of the farms
used copper sulfate. The remaining 21(43.8%) of the
poultry farms were not using any disinfectant.

Salmonella serotype distribution and antimicrobial
susceptibility
Salmonella Saintpaul was
serotype
detected in poultry farms accounting for 20 (76.9%) of
isolates. Other serotypes, such as S. Typhimurium
all
(n = 3), S. Kentucky (n = 2) and S. Haifa (n = 1) were also
detected. Rate of resistance to antimicrobials tested and

resistance patterns of the isolates are shown in Tables 4
and 5 respectively. Of all the Salmonella isolates tested,
(n = 24, 92.3%) were resistant
to sulfisoxazole and
streptomycin, (n = 12, 46.2%) of the isolates were resist-
ant to cephalothin, while (n = 11, 42.3%) were resistant
to ampicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, kanamycin
and chloramphenicol (Table 4).

Overall, multidrug resistance was commonly detected
in Salmonella isolates in the current study particularly
in strains belonging to S. Saintpaul and the two S. Ken-
tucky isolates. All S. Saintpaul strains in the current
study were isolated from farms in Ada’a district. How-
ever, there was wide diversity in their antimicrobial sus-
ceptibility pattern even among isolates obtained from

the same farm. Some of them were resistant to only few
antimicrobials while others were MDR to several anti-
microbials. The two S. Kentucky isolates were resistant
to 9 of the 18 antimicrobials tested (Table 5).

Discussion
Colonization of poultry with Salmonella without detect-
able clinical signs at farm level followed by contamin-
ation of poultry products with subsequent access to
human food chain has been considered as the major
sources of human salmonellosis [21, 22]. Salmonella in
healthy poultry is the main risk factor for possible out-
break of human salmonellosis and epidemiological stud-
ies have shown the huge contribution of contaminated

poultry products to human salmonellosis [23, 24]. In
fact, some countries have shown that successful con-
trol measures involving surveillance,
improved biose-
curity and vaccination targeting specific serovars in
poultry can result in reduction of human salmonel-
losis cases [21, 24].

In the current study, 7(14.6%) of the 48 examined
poultry farms were positive for Salmonella. This is very
much low compared to studies conducted in Morocco
and Nigeria where 76.7% and [25], 43.6% [26] of the
poultry farms were contaminated by Salmonella, re-
spectively. Sample level prevalence of Salmonella was
also low in the current study (4.7%) compared to previ-
ous studies conducted elsewhere. For instance, Salmon-
ella prevalence in fecal samples from conventional
poultry farms in USA was reported to be 38.8% while it
was 5.6% in organic farms [27]. Salmonella prevalence
in conventional poultry is usually very high in different
countries [28–31]. The possible reason for low preva-
lence of Salmonella in the current study could be due
to the fact that most of the poultry farms in the current
study were small scale farms holding small number of
birds unlike most of the large commercial poultry farms
where they keep thousands of birds and the feeding
and management activities associated with intensifica-
tion allows easy dissemination of the pathogen within
the farm. This finding is in agreement with previous re-
port where large farms were significantly associated

with high prevalence of Salmonella compared to
medium and small farms [32].

Both farm level and pooled sample level prevalence of
Salmonella was high in farms from Ada’a district com-
pared to other areas, which could be due to larger num-
ber of poultry farms examined from this district
compared to others as well as difference in agroecology.
Ada’a district is highly concentrated with large number
of poultry farms and is located in rift valley which is
relatively warm region compared to Addis Ababa, Sebeta
and Barake districts. The fact that most of the large
poultry farms in the country including the parent stocks
are located in Ada’a district and most of the farms from
this area shared a single serotype, S. Saintpaul implies
the possibility of transmission of Salmonella from farm
to farm in this town. Salmonella Saintpaul is not fre-
quently isolated from poultry in other previous studies
elsewhere. Salmonella Kentucky was the dominant sero-
var in studies conducted in Nigeria [26] and Bangladesh
[31] and S. Entertidis was dominant in Spain [33]; while
S. Typhimurium was dominant in China [34]. Although
there is no serotype data on Salmonella isolates from
poultry at farm level in Ethiopia, previous study from
poultry food items in Addis Ababa did not report S.
Saintpaul [35]. As most of the farms obtain their day old
chickens or pullets from a few parent stock farms lo-
cated in this district, there is likelihood of contamination
of poultry from source farms. In addition, S. Saintpaul

was the major serotype detected in dairy farms in this
study area which suggests possibility of transmission be-
tween dairy and poultry farms [14].

The high rate of resistance to sulfixazole and strepto-
mycin (92.3%) is not concordant with the current rate of
use of antimicrobials in farms investigated. However, pre-
viously, different sulfonamide drugs and streptomycin to-
gether with penicillin were the common antimicrobials
frequently used in the country for treatment of various in-
fectious diseases in veterinary medicine and recent studies
showed that sulfonamides and streptomycin are the 2nd
and 3rd most prescribed veterinary medications respect-
ively in the study area next to oxytetracycline [36]. Simi-
larly, high resistance rate to ampicillin and tetracycline
could be due to long term use of these antimicrobials in

veterinary medicine including poultry. Interestingly, the
two S. Kentucky isolates resistant to several drugs includ-
ing nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin were isolated from one
of a few farms which reported use of fluoroquinolones for
therapeutic purposes in the farm suggesting possible con-
tribution of use of these drugs in the farm for selection of
these strains. Eleven (42.3%) of the isolates in the current
study, most of which belonging to S. Saintpaul from farms
in Ada’a district were resistant to chloramphenicol unlike
previous study where all of the isolates obtained from food
of animal origin including poultry products were fully sus-
ceptible to chloramphenicol [35]. Unlike previous study in
south Ethiopia [11] where extremely high proportion of
Salmonella isolates (97.8%) were resistant to second gen-
eration cephalosporin (cefoxitin), in this study, none of

the isolates were resistant to this drug. This could be due
to over use of betalactam drugs in the previous farms.

Conclusion
Despite low prevalence of Salmonella in poultry farms
in the study area, circulation of MDR strains in some
farms warrant special biosecurity measures to hinder
dissemination of these pathogens to other farms and the
public. Moreover, awareness creation on prudent use of
antimicrobials is recommended.
