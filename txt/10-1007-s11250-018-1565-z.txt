Abstract
Prevalence and distribution of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) serogroups from the faecal samples of
cattle and camels slaughter in Maiduguri abattoir and their antibiotic resistance profile of the isolates were determined.
The highest prevalence (24%) was recorded in the month of September and more STEC isolates came from cattle than
the camels. There was significant (P < 0.05) seasonal trend in the prevalence of STEC among cattle and camel with more
cases recorded during the wet season. Although, the study did not demonstrate significant influence of sex from the
various sources. The serogroups recorded in this study were O157, O26, O91, O103 and O111. There was no significant
difference (P < 0.05) between the detection rates of serogroups. The serogroup O26 was significantly (P < 0.05) the most
observed serogroup in both camels and cattle. None of the STEC isolates tested positive for the O45 serogroup. PCR
assays shows that 50 (63.3%) of the 86 STEC isolates carried the stx2 gene, 34 (43%) possessed the stx1 gene, and 14
(16.3%) carried both stx1 and stx2 genes. Other genes detected include eae and ehlyA. The antimicrobial resistance
among the STEC O157 and non-O157 isolates from cattle and camels in Maiduguri abattoir were very high and the
STEC isolates were resistant to at least one or more of the antimicrobial agents tested. There was also multidrug
resistance with the most frequent occurring patterns been ampicillin/nalidixic acid and tetracycline/trimethoprim.
However, all the 79 isolates were sensitive to chloramphenicol, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone; therefore, these drugs could
be drugs of choice in the treatment of STEC infections.

Introduction

E. coli is regarded as a pathogen of worldwide importance in
commercially produced beef, its presence can lead to signifi-
cant economic losses (Rigobelo and de Ávila 2012). Most
E. coli strains are harmless commensals, but some serotypes
can cause serious food poisoning in humans (Hassan et al.
2014; CDC 2018). Shiga toxin, a potent cytotoxin, is mainly
produced by Escherichia coli and Shigella dysenteriae type 1,
and sporadically could be produced by Citrobacter freundii,
Enterobacter cloacae, Shigella flexneri, Shigella sonnei,
Aeromonas hydrophila, and Aeromonas caviae (Llorente
et al. 2014). Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli
(STEC) are one of the most
important groups of
diarrhoeagenic E. coli that is associated with food-borne out-
breaks (Paton and Paton 1998; Beutin et al. 2007). STEC have

1328

been identified to be pathogenic to humans and a major source
of contamination for foods of animal origin constituting a
major public health concern (Dastmalchi and Ayremlou
2012). Farm animals are asymptomatic carriers of STEC,
a zoonotic enteric pathogen that causes human gastrointes-
tinal illnesses and meat contaminated by STEC is an im-
portant means for zoonotic transmission from animals to
humans (Ojo et al. 2010; Amézquita-López et al. 2014).
Bovine E. coli strains can produce Shiga-like toxins (Stx),
heat labile (LT) or heat-stabile (ST) enterotoxins, cytotoxic
necrotizing factors (CNF1 and CNF2) and haemolysins
(Rigobelo and de Ávila 2012).

STEC are characterized by the production of one or more
types of Shiga toxins (stx1 or stx2 or their variants), which
subdue the host cells’ protein synthesis (Melton-Celsa 2014).
Infection by these enterotoxins results in diarrhoeic secretions
due to the action of one or more enterotoxins, and can lead to
dehydration and death. (Rigobelo et al. 2006).

The most important natural reservoirs of STEC are cattle.
Transmission to humans occurs through food, water, and di-
rect contact with animals or their environment (Bonanno et al.
2015). Since cattle are the reservoir for STEC, studies have
found an association between cattle population and the inci-
dence of STEC infections in humans. The incidence of STEC
infection in humans was higher in areas with high cattle pop-
ulation and in areas where manure was used for agricultural
practices (Frank et al. 2008).

Three main routes of transmission have been identified by
outbreak investigators as food borne infections which are fre-
quently associated with consumption of contaminated
undercooked beef and unpasteurized milk, person to person
spread, and direct or indirect animal contact (Parry et al.
1998). Direct and indirect zoonotic transmission through con-
tact with animals or their faeces has also been reported in
several settings (Synge and Hopkins 1994).

The main virulence factors of STEC associated with
human disease are potent cytotoxins also called shiga toxin
(stx1 and stx2), which are encoded by the stx1 and stx2
genes. Two additional markers also play a major role in
the pathogenesis of haemolytic colitis and haemolytic ure-
mic syndrome (HUS), they include intimin, encoded by the
eae gene, and enterohaemolysin, encoded by the ehlyA
gene (Paton and Paton 1998 and Karmali et al. 2010).
This genetic virulence characteristic is often used in epide-
miological studies to correlate between strains from vari-
ous sources (Askari et al. 2010)

Without any doubt, antimicrobial therapy is a major tool for
infectious disease treatment in veterinary medical practice but
resistance to antimicrobials is a cause of great concern (Beco
et al. 2013). The global rise in the prevalence of antibiotic
resistance is an important problem especially in developing
countries where there is limited control of the quality, distri-
bution and use of antibiotics in human medicine, veterinary

medicine, and food-animal agriculture (Okeke et al. 1999;
Kumarasamy et al. 2010).

Diseases caused by E. coli often require antimicrobial ther-
apy; however, antibiotic-resistant strains of this bacterium
cause longer and more severe illnesses than their antibiotic-
susceptible counterparts (Shahrani et al. 2014).

Isolation of non-O157 STEC and some EPEC serotypes
was reported from faeces of diarrheic calves collected from
various farms in Zaria, North-central Nigeria (Sa’Ayinzat et al.
2015), but the prevalence and distribution of STEC
serogroups O157, O26, O45, O91, O103 and O111 which
are associated with public health risks are unknown in cattle
and camel around Maiduguri, North-eastern Nigeria, in spite
of the public health safety problems this poses. It is due to this
prevalent background that this study was conducted to deter-
mine the prevalence and characteristics of Shiga toxin-
producing E. coli (STEC) isolated from cattle and camels in
Maiduguri, Nigeria.

The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of
STEC isolates from faeces of slaughtered cattle and camels in
Maiduguri, Nigeria, to determine the serogroups of the STEC
isolates, determine the virulent genes using polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) and to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility
patterns of the STEC isolates.

Material and methods

Study area

Maiduguri, our study area is located in the semi-arid zone of
Borno State, situated in the North Eastern part of Nigeria, with
an area of about 69,436 km2 and lies within latitude 10 - 13°N
and longitude 12 - 15°E. It lies within the savannah and Sahel
vegetation, and receives little average annual rainfall of
613 mm. The wet season in the study area starts in April and
extends into Mid-October while the dry season runs from
November till Mid-March.

The State shares boundaries with Chad to the North East,
Cameroon to the East and Adamawa state to the South West.
One of the main Agricultural activities in this area is livestock
production.

Sampling techniques

Faecal samples were collected from cattle and camels
slaughtered at the Maiduguri abattoir. The sample size was
calculated using the formula n = t2 × p (1 − p) ÷ m2 from each
source as described by FAO (1990). n represents the number
of sample to be collected, t is the confidence level at 95% and
standard value is 1.96; p is the estimated percentage preva-
lence from each sample source and m is the margin of error at
5% (standard value is 0.05).

Isolation and identification of STEC

Faecal samples were collected from cattle and camels
slaughtered at Maiduguri abattoir. All samples were col-
lected in sterile well-labelled containers and were
transported to the University of Maiduguri Veterinary
Diagnostic Microbiology Laboratory in ice packs to avoid
putrefaction before analysis. At the laboratory, the sam-
ples were enriched in modified tryptone soya broth
(mTSB), supplemented with novobiocin using the ratio
of 1:9 (1 g of faeces in 9 ml of mTSB) and incubated at
37 °C for an initial period of 6 h and then for an extended
period of 12 h as described by Savoye et al. (2011). From
the Broth, a loopful of the culture was streaked on to
MacConkey agar (Oxoid®, UK) plates. The plates were
then incubated for 24 h at 37πC and bacterial growths
were observed. Lactose fermenting colonies were picked
and then streaked on eosin methylene blue (EMB) agar
(Oxoid®, UK) plates. Typical E. coli colonies were pick-
ed as presumptive isolates (Plate 1). Plates with mixed
cultures were subcultured to obtain a pure culture of
E. coli and pure E.coli isolates were then transferred to
Nutrient agar (Oxoid®, UK) slants, incubated at 37 °C for
24 h. After growth was observed, the presumptive E. coli
colonies on nutrient agar (CM3, (Oxoid®,UK) slants were
picked and streaked on to sorbitol McConkey agar cul-
tures (SMAC) (CM813, Oxoid®, UK) and then incubated
for 24 h at 37 °C. The identity was confirmed by motility
and biochemical
tests (indole, methyl red, Voges-
Proskauer, and Simmons citrate tests) using standard pro-
cedures as described by Cheesbrough (2000). The

confirmed E. coli isolates based on the results of the bio-
chemical tests were selected for antimicrobial agent sensi-
tivity testing. And these confirmed isolates were inoculated
into new TSB tubes and incubated until the turbidity was
0.5 McFarland standard, this was done for 3 h.

Detection of E. coli O26, O103, O111, O91 and O45
serogroups

E. coli Non-O157 Identification Kit, Prolex™ (PL 1070) pro-
duced by Pro-Lab Diagnostics Round Rock, TX, USA, was
used to determine the serogroup of the isolates from cattle and
camel faecal samples. The test cards labelled with each of the
serogroups O26, O103, O111, O191 or O45 were used in the
detection.

PCR techniques

1 ml of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) was transferred to a 1.5-
ml Eppendorf tube. Then a loop full of the bacterium was
picked from a plate and transferred to the Eppendorf tube
and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. Supernatant was
discarded and the pellet was re-suspended in 100 μl TE buffer.
The suspension was boiled at 95 °C for 10 min and then
transferred directly to ice to form a lysate. The lysed DNA
was diluted 10-fold in TE buffer from presumptive pure E.coli
strains, grown overnight in nutrient broth (Sigma Chemical
Co. USA) at a temperature of 37 °C, they were further pelleted
by centrifugation. Lysate was centrifuged again as described
above and 50 μl of the supernatants were used as DNA for the
PCR assay. The PCR assay list of the primers, their sequence
and lengths are shown in Table 1. All E. coli isolates from
cattle and camel faecal samples were subjected to PCR. Stx 1,
stx 2 andeae virulent genes were detected using the primers
and PCR assay technique as described by China et al. (1998)
and Scheutz et al. (2012).

Expression of enterohaemolysin A (EHlyA)

The E. coli isolates were observed for haemolytic activities on
a blood agar plates containing phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) made from nutrient agar containing washed and un-
washed 7% sheep erythrocytes (RBC). Strains, which were
haemolytic on both washed and unwashed 7% sheep blood
agar within 4–6 h of incubation at a temperature of 37 °C with
a clear, broad zone of alpha haemolysis were considered to
have produced alpha-haemolysin (a-hly), while those that
were only haemolytic on washed sheep blood agar with a
narrow, turbid haemolytic halo after more than 8 h incubation
duration at a temperature of 37 °C produced enterohaemolysin
(ehly) (Plate 2). Expression of enterohaemolysin was deter-
mined based on the method described by Beutin et al. (1997).

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Antibiotic susceptibility testing of all the E.coli isolates was done
with Mueller-Hinton agar (CM337, Oxoid® UK) plates with an
agar depth of 4 mm, were prepared according to manufacturer’s
instructions and prior to use were visually examined to ensure
that plates were free of visible contamination before poured to a
uniform depth of approximately 4 mm. Within 15 min of prepar-
ing the adjusted inocula, a sterile cotton swabs were used to
streak the inocula evenly on the surface of the agar. The swabs
were rotated several times and pressed firmly on the inside wall
of the tube above the fluid level to remove excess inocula from
the swabs. Any excess moisture on the agar surface was allowed
to be absorbed prior to application of the antimicrobial disks. The
lid of the plates were left slightly opened for 5 min to allow
excess moisture to be absorbed before applying disks

Disk diffusion method of antibiotic susceptibility testing as de-
scribed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory
Standards (Reller et al. 2009) was used. The values were
interpreted using the prescribed standards by CLSI (2006).

Statistical analysis

The Student t test was used to analyse the difference among the
various serogroups, virulence genes properties and seasonal
trend. Duncan’s multiple range test and Pearson correlation anal-
ysis were used for testing associations between virulent genes.

Results

Prevalence of STEC organisms from faecal samples
of cattle and camel

Out of the 600 faecal samples from cattle, 9.3% (n = 56) were
positive for the presence of STEC (Table 2). The highest, 24.0%
(n = 12) prevalence was recorded in the month of September, this
was followed by 22% (n = 11) and 14.0% (n = 7) for the months
of October and June, respectively. The months of July, December
and January had 12.0% (n = 6) each. No STEC was isolated
during the months of January and March. There was significant
(P < 0.05) seasonal influence on prevalence of STEC among
faeces of cattle tested (Table 3). The highest isolation rates
20.0% (n = 29) and 12.8% (n = 14) were recorded in wet season
for female and male cattle, respectively. The prevalence in dry
season was 3.6% (n = 8) and 3.8% (n = 5) for female and male
cattle, respectively. There was no significant difference in the
prevalence rate of STEC between male and female cattle.

Out of the 600 faecal samples collected from camels, 3.8%
(n = 23) of the samples were found to be positive for STEC
(Table 4). The highest 10.0% (n = 5) prevalence rate was re-
corded in the month of September, this was followed by 8.0%

(n = 4), in the month of June, and 6.0% (n = 3) each in the
months of July, December and January. No STEC was isolated
during the months of August, February and March. There was
significant (P < 0.05) seasonal trend in the isolation of STEC
from camel faeces (Table 4). The highest isolation rate 6.9%
(n = 17) was recorded in wet season. This was significantly
lower than the rate 1.7% (n = 6) obtained in the dry season.
There was also no significant (P < 0.05) difference in the prev-
alence of STEC among the male and female camels tested. The
prevalence of STEC among the male and female camels were
4.7% (n = 11) and 3.3% (n = 12), respectively (Table 5).

Biochemical characteristics of STEC isolates

Results of the bacteriological studies showed that, out of the
1200 faecal samples collected from camels and cattle (n = 600
each), 27.0% (n = 162) and 36.6% (n = 220) samples respec-
tively showed typical growths of Escherichia coli as shown in
Fig. 1. Out of the 382 biochemically presumptive E. coli iso-
lates, 9.91% (n = 119) were non-sorbitol fermenters (NSF),
with 33.8% (n = 73) from cattle and 30.1% (n = 41) from

camels. Motility test showed that 27.7% (n = 33) of the con-
firmed non-sorbitol fermenting E. coli isolates were motile
(Table 6).

Serogrouping of STEC isolates from cattle

In cattle, the 56 STEC isolates belonged to 5 different
serogroups. The results as shown in Table 7 revealed that
12.5% (n = 7) were O157 and 87.5% (n = 49) were non-
O157 serogroup. Serogroup O26 accounted for 39.3% (n =
22) of the isolates, which was significantly (P < 0.05) the most
frequently detected serogroup among the non-O157 (Table 7).
There was no significant difference between the detection
rates of serogroups O103, 10.7% (n = 6) and O157, 12.5%
(n = 7). However, serogroup O91 accounted for 32.1% (n =
18) of the STEC isolates from cattle.

Serogrouping of STEC isolates from camels

Out of the 23 STEC isolates from camels, 17.4% (n = 4)
belonged to serogroup O157, while 82.6% (n = 19) were

belonged to serogroup O103. However, serogroups O111
and O91 accounted for 13.0% (n = 3) and 8.7% (n = 2) iso-
lates, respectively. None of the STEC isolates tested positive
for the O45 serogroup (Table 8).

Detection of stx1, stx2, eae genes and enterohaemolysin A

The results of the PCR assays show that 63.3% (n = 50) of the 86
STEC isolates carried the stx2 gene, 43% (n = 34) possessed the
stx1 gene, and 16.3% (n = 14) carried both stx1 and stx2 genes
(Table 9). Stx1 genes were more prevalent in camel (43.5%) than
cattle (42.9%) although not significantly different, whereas stx2

strains were more commonly recovered from cattle (71.4%) and
camels (43.5%). Isolates carrying both stx1- and stx2 genes were
more frequently isolated from cattle (23.2%) than from camels
(4.3%). The 79 STEC isolates were investigated for the presence
of the eae genes, only 38% (n = 30) of 79 STEC isolates were
positive for the eae gene (Fig. 3).The eae genes were significant-
ly (P < 0.05) higher in STEC from camels (69.6%) than those in
cattle (25.0%), respectively (Table 9). The result for haemolytic
activities of the 79 STEC isolates is also presented in Table 9. Out
of the 79 STEC isolates, 38% (n = 30) produced clear narrow
zones of haemolysis on nutrient agar containing 7% washed
sheep blood, typical of enterohaemolysin production. Some of
the plates are shown in Plate 1. 69.6% (n = 16) of the isolates that
produce enterohaemolysin were from camels and were signifi-
cantly (P < 0.05) higher than those from cattle (25.0%).
Figures 1, 2 and 3 show the photographs of Agarose gel electro-
phoresis analysis results of PCR assays of stx1, stx2 and eae
genes of the E. coli isolates from the faecal samples of the cattle
and camels slaughtered at the Maiduguri Abattoir.

Pattern of distribution of virulence genes in the 79 STEC
isolates from cattle and camels in Maiduguri

The results of virulence gene (stx1, stx2, eae and ehlyA) char-
acteristics of the 79 STEC isolates from the various sources
showed that 100% of the isolates had at least one virulence
genes (Table 10). The results revealed eleven pattern of distri-
bution of the virulence genes from the 79 STEC isolates.
There were significant differences (P < 0.05) among the com-
binations from the cattle and camel faecal sources. The most
frequent pattern among the isolates from camels was stx1/eae/
ehlyA 34.2% (n = 8) which was significantly more than what
was obtained in cattle 8.9% (n = 5). Gene stx2 was significant-
ly higher among cattle isolates (32%), than for the camels
(21.7%). Overall results did show that, there was significant
(P < 0.05) positive correlation between the eae and ehlyA
genes among the isolates. However negative correlation exist
among the isolates for stx1 and stx2 genes, Also, there was
significant (P < 0.05) positive correlation between the eae and
stx2 genes.

Antibacterial susceptibility testing of STEC

The antimicrobial resistance among the STEC O157 and non-
O157 isolates from cattle and camels in Maiduguri abattoir are
shown in Table 11. Whereas, camels STEC O157 isolates
were more resistant to tetracycline than isolates from cattle
(Table 12). Only one STEC non-O157 was resistant to cefo-
taxime which was isolated from camels slaughtered at the
Maiduguri abattoir (Plate 3). None of the isolates was resistant
to chloramphenicol, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone. Cattle STEC
O157 isolates showed a higher number of resistance 42.9%
(n = 3), to ampicillin and streptomycin each than the number
of resistance 28.6% (n = 2) to gentamycin and nalidixic acid
28.6% (n = 2), this is shown in Table 13. Ampicillin, and
tetracycline 41.7% (n = 5) each, were the most commonly
resistant antimicrobials, followed by streptomycin 33.3%
(n = 4), gentamycin, nalidixic acid and trimethoprim 25%
(n = 3) each and cefotaxime 8.3% (n = 1). None of the isolates
were resistant to chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime
and ceftriaxone. Cattle non-O157 STEC showed a higher
number of resistant strains than camel to ampicillin (65.3%)
and gentamycin (26.5%).

Multidrug resistance patterns of STEC isolates
from camels and cattle

The multidrug resistance profile of STEC isolated from
camels and cattle is shown in Table 14. STEC isolates that
were resistant to at least one or more of the antimicrobial
agents tested. The most frequent occurring patterns were
ampicillin/nalidixic acid and tetracycline/trimethoprim,

10.4% (n = 7) each. This is followed by gentamycin/
trimethoprim 7.4% (n = 5). All the most frequent resistance
profiles were identified among STEC isolates from camels
and cattle.

Discussions

The results of this study suggest that camel and cattle faeces
are important sources of meat contamination with STEC O157
and non-O157 STEC in Maiduguri. In developing countries,
high level of carcass contamination with faeces from gastro-
intestinal tracts of food animals is common in abattoir and
slaughter slabs. This is specifically true in Nigeria, where
butchering of meat are done on concrete floor under unhy-
gienic slaughtering and meat processing conditions with lack
of potable water (Olatoye 2010).

The results of this study showed that the prevalence of
STEC from camel faeces in Maiduguri was 3.8%. The values
obtained concur with the findings reported by Rahimi et al.
2010, pp. 179–185 and 2012, pp. 559–564 from Iran and
Bosilevac et al. 2015, pp. 89–96, although the latter reported
a higher prevalence of 10.7% in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
However, this finding is at variance with previous reports on
camel faecal samples from the United Arab Emirates, where
E. coli O157:H7 was not identified (Moore et al. 2002, pp.
283–287) and East African countries (El-Sayed et al. 2008,
pp. 469–473).

The differences observed may be due to differences in geo-
graphical locations and laboratory techniques used for the
detection of STEC organisms. However, those studies targeted

only serogroup O157 and one of the reasons advanced for
failure to detect STEC in camels around the desert could be
that, the sedentary life pattern of camels in the desert mini-
mizes the contact of camels with other animal species and
therefore the transmission of STEC (El-Sayed et al. 2008).
In Maiduguri, during the dry season, camel population in-
creases because of movements of camel nomads from deserts
in search of feeds, where camels and cattle come in contact
during grazing. Cattle have been reported to be reservoirs for
STEC in Maiduguri (Moses et al. 2012), for this reason there
could be interspecies transfer of STEC from cattle to camels.
In this study, 9.3% of the cattle faeces tested were positive
for STEC. Although, ruminants have been reported as the
main natural reservoir for human STEC infections (Caprioli
et al. 2005; Gyles 2007 and Hussein 2007), the figure obtained
in this study was rather low compared to previous reports of
19% in India by Das et al. 2005, pp. 617–626, in Bangladesh
by Islam et al. 2008, pp. 5414–5421 and in Nigeria by Ojo
et al. 2009, pp. 23–30, reported 10%. This discrepancy in
prevalence might be due to the regional differences and man-
agement system. Caprioli et al. 2005, pp. 289–311, reported
that the use of specific immunoconcentration procedures for
STEC O157 as used by (Islam et al. 2006a, b) strongly

enhanced the sensitivity of the isolation methods and higher
rates of recovery.

The results of this study showed a significant seasonal
trend. For cattle and camels, the prevalence of STEC was
significantly higher in the wet season than in the dry season.
These results corroborate with a study by Persson et al. 2007,
pp. 516–524, reported high prevalence of E. coli O157:H7/
NM in meat sampled in summer and fall. However, in a study
of non-O157 STEC performed on sheep, the prevalence did
not follow the seasonal trend previously reported for STEC
O157:H7, with the highest prevalence rates (up to 26.0%)
reported during winter and spring (Pierard et al. 1997, pp.
531–540). Kudva et al. 1997, pp. 892–899, hypothesized that
changes in diet or environment influenced the seasonal varia-
tion in the prevalence of STEC O157:H7. A higher prevalence
rate (10.7%) of E. coli O157 was reported when cattle hides
were tested in the summer at Midwestern beef processing
plants (Elder et al. 2000). This agrees with the findings of
the present study. These different prevalence rates could be
explained by sampling time. It is important to note that quan-
titative faecal shedding of STEC is considered a more impor-
tant factor than prevalence in influencing the risk of human
exposure and infection with STEC. Interestingly, the high
prevalence recorded in camel and cattle during the wet season
in this study corresponded with the human incidences record-
ed in the same season as recorded by Adamu et al. (2017).
This agrees with the reports of Ogden et al. 2004, pp. 297–
300, that the prevalence of E. colio157 in beef cattle at slaugh-
ter was found to be greater (P < 0.05) during the cooler

months (11.2%) than during the warmer months (7.5%) which
explain increased human infections at that time. This was the
reverse of the known seasonality of human infections with
STEC (WHO 1998).

Investigations on the prevalence of STEC are most com-
monly based on detection of the O157 serogroup. The preva-
lence in cattle faeces varies widely from 0 to over 50%
(Rhoades et al. 2009). However, the results of STEC
serogrouping reported in this study revealed that all the
STEC isolates were within the six STEC serogroups that were
tested for. Therefore, it is not surprising to have 56 STEC
isolates from cattle of which all tested positive for at least
one of the six STEC serotypes tested. Studies have shown that
there are numerous STEC serotypes with 174 O antigens and
53 H antigens (Scheutz et al. 2004). Similarly, Blanco et al.
2003, pp. 345–351, reported about 200 serotypes of STEC.
Therefore, the prevalence of the STEC serogroups for cattle
differs depending on different factors. Different prevalence
rates were reported for both E coli O157 and non-O157
E. coli, depending on the type of animal tested the season
and the animal production system (Hussein 2007).

E. coli O26 was the most commonly isolated serogroup of
those tested in camel faeces. Forty percent of E. coli O26

isolates carried stx2, eae, and ehly. This result contradicts the
findings of several other studies which found that E. coli O26
strains typically carry stx1 and eae but not stx2 (Burnens et al.
1995; Blanco et al. 1997). However, high rates of carriage of
stx2 among E. coli O26 isolates from cattle have been reported
(Geue et al. 2002), which agrees with the results of this work.
It could be seen that, in most of the serogroup O26 strains
isolated during this study, the carriage of stx1 was significant-
ly (P < 0.001) associated with the carriage of eae, and ehly. In
strains of E. coli O26 associated with diarrhoea and HUS in
humans, it is common to find stx1, eae, and ehly (Zhang et al.
2009; Schmidt et al. 1999). Some strains carrying vtx2 have
also been associated with diarrhoea and HUS (York et al.
2010). In addition, the stx1, eae, and ehly genes were much
more common in E. coli O26 than in other serogroups.
This may play an important role in facilitating colonization
in the gut.

E. coli O103 and O157 were the second most common-
ly isolated serogroup of those tested in camel faeces. Half
of the E. coli O103 isolates carried stx2. This result is in
contrast to the findings of a number of other studies in
which STEC O103 possessed stx1 only (Wells et al. 1991,
pp. 985–989; Zhang et al. 2009, pp. 449–454). Unlike
serogroup O103, and serogroup O157 which were isolated
at the same frequency, all but one isolate carried stx2 and
ehly. This finding is significant, since stx2 and ehly are
regarded as important virulence factors found in E. coli
O157 strains associated with HC and HUS in humans
(Serna and Boedeker 2008).

The absence of E. coli O45 in this study was not a surprise
since this serogroup has not been found frequently in either
camel or cattle (York et al. 2010; El-Sayed et al. 2008).
However, the low prevalence of E. coli O91 serogroup is
consistent with the findings of other studies (Krüger et al.

serogroup was uncommon and, with the exception of E. coli
O26 and O91, we found no tendency for two serogroups to be
isolated simultaneously more than could be expected by
chance. Although E. coli O91 was detected in two samples,
in one of these it occurred simultaneously with E. coli O26.
All the eleven virulence gene profiles were observed
among isolates from cattle and six among isolates from
camels. There were significant differences (P < 0.05) among
the virulence gene profiles from the various sources. The most
frequent virulence gene profile among the isolates was stx1/
eae/ehlyA, which was significantly more among camels than

the cattle isolates. Accordingly, these strains should be con-
sidered pathogenic for humans; however, their ability to cause
severe disease and their potential to cause outbreaks could be
questioned because most outbreak of STEC infection was
associated with stx2-positive strains (EFSA 2009). Also iso-
lates from cattle with the same profile or carrying stx1 genes in
this study could be potential pathogens for humans (Gyles and
Fairbrother 2004).

Isolates with stx2 only in this study were significantly more
among cattle than the camel isolates. Also it was observed that
significant (P < 0.05) positive correlations between the eae
and stx2 genes exist among the isolates in this study. In

agreement with the present study, stx2 was the dominant Shiga
toxin type in some other studies (Beutin et al. 1997, pp. 2175–
2180 and Zahraei et al. 2006). In contrast, several studies have
also shown that stx1 was the major Shiga toxin type among
STEC isolates from calves (Orden et al. 1998, pp. 239–248
and Leomil et al. 2003, pp. 103–109; Akter et al. 2016, pp.
63–68). The important criteria for these types of variations
could be the geographical area where the animals originated.
Five profiles that were found among isolates from cattle were
not found in camels and six were not found in human. All
profiles found in isolates from camels and humans are also
present in isolates from cattle. This finding reconfirmed cattle
as the reservoir for STEC.

According to Blanco et al. 2003, pp. 345–351 and Luga
et al. 2007, pp. 205–211, non-O157 STEC isolated from
calves with diarrhoea showed that the majority (77–81%) of
STEC were resistant to at least one of the antimicrobial agents
tested, with numerous isolates being resistant to streptomycin,
tetracycline, and sulphonamide.

The present study documents for the first time in North
Eastern, Nigeria, the antimicrobial resistance of a large collec-
tion of STEC O157 and non-O57 strains from cattle and cam-
el. In the present study, increasing resistance was observed.

Among the 79 STEC isolated in this study, a higher level of
resistance was detected in camel (87%) and cattle (82%). This
is in accordance with data obtained by Sayah et al. 2005, pp.
1394–1404, Aibinu et al. 2007, pp. 22–33 and Shittu et al.
2007, pp. 164–170, they obtained a high percentage of resis-
tance in isolates from animals and man.

The incidence of antimicrobial resistance among E. coli
O157 and non-O157 isolated in this study indicated that

82% of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimi-
crobial agent.

Isolates from cattle showed more multidrug resistance than
isolates from camels. Similar findings on multiple drug resis-
tance of E. coli strains have been reported from Nigeria and
other parts of the world (Aibinu et al. 2007; Ojo et al. 2009,
Islam et al. 2016). The high level resistance to tetracycline
obtained in this study also agrees with the report of Daini
and Adesemowo 2008, pp. 397–400, who reported resistance
in 54 and 88% STEC strains against gentamicin and tetracy-
cline, respectively.

Aibinu et al. 2007, pp. 22–33, also reported 94.4% resis-
tance to tetracycline in isolates from animals and man. It is
interesting that isolates from cattle and camels showed resis-
tance to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin which are quinolones
and fluoroquinolones, respectively, in addition to most of the
frequently resisted antibiotics such as ampicillin, tetracycline
trimethoprim and gentamycin.

The high prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in
Nigeria and other developing countries has been associated
with several factors including indiscriminate use of antimicro-
bials due to unregulated access of non-professionals to differ-
ent classes of antimicrobials over-the-counter (Okeke et al.
1999; Kabir et al. 2002). Tetracycline is one of the most com-
monly available antibiotics for use as growth promoter and
routine chemoprophylaxis in livestock production in our
country, Nigeria. They are readily available in different dosage
forms and in combination with other antibiotics and vitamins,
hence the high levels of resistance observed in this study.

The public health significance of these findings is that an-
timicrobial resistant bacteria from food animals may colonize

the human population via the food chain by consuming im-
properly cooked enteral (visceral offal).

In conclusion, the findings of this study showed that more
STEC isolates came from cattle compare to camels. There was
significant (P < 0.05) seasonal trend in the prevalence of
STEC among cattle and camel with more cases recorded dur-
ing the wet season. Although, the study did not demonstrate
significant influence of sex from the various sources. The
serogroups recorded in this study were O157, non-O157 such
as O26, O91, O103 and O111. This study documented the

prevalent presence of stx2 genes, followed by stx1. Other
genes detected in this study were eae and ehlyA. The antimi-
crobial susceptibility study showed high resistance profile to
the agents tested. However all the 79 isolates were sensitive to
chloramphenicol, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone. This is the first
report of a large collection of antimicrobial resistance of
STEC O157 and non-O157 strains in North Eastern, Nigeria.
The presence of STEC from faeces of these animals are
alarm bells indicating food safety problems. We therefore rec-
ommend improvement in slaughter house hygiene to

minimize the risk of human infections. Furthermore, a system-
atic research be conducted on the meat of these animals to
evaluate the level of contamination by STEC.
