Summary

In this study, eight Escherichia coli isolates were obtained from milk samples of
dairy cattle suffering from clinical/subclinical mastitis. Isolates were characterized
for antimicrobial resistance traits and virulence genes. Results revealed that one
isolate was harbouring New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase gene (blaNDM). Cloning
and sequencing of the PCR amplicon conﬁrmed the identity of the gene (Gen-
Bank accession no. KC769583) having 100% homology with blaNDM-5 (GenBank
accession no. JN104597.1), and this isolate was susceptible to colistin, chloram-
phenicol and tetracycline only. Moreover, another isolate carried extended-
spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) gene – blaCTX-M, and all
isolates possessed
blaTEM gene. Of the eight isolates, only one isolate was positive for shiga toxin
gene (stx2), and none were harbouring stx1 gene. Occurrence of New Delhi metal-
lo-beta-lactamase (blaNDM) in one E. coli isolate and ESBL genes in other isolates
poses a potential threat to human health following possible entry and spread
through food chain.

Introduction

Resistance due to metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) and
extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) is emerging
problems that compromise treatments of cases of bacterial
infection. Among MBLs, New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamas-
es (NDMs) are the recent ones that have been detected ﬁrst
in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli isolates (Yong
et al., 2009). This was followed by numerous reports from
many parts of the world (Pillai et al., 2011) including India
(Kumarasamy et al., 2010; Manchanda et al., 2011). Of late
evidence of detection of MBLs has started coming from
animal associated isolates, for example, Acinetobacter lwofﬁi
(Wang et al., 2012) and E. coli
(Anonymous, 2012).
Because enterobacteria carrying NDM gene are resistant to
almost all antimicrobials with the exception of colistin and
tigecycline (Kumarasamy et al., 2010), the presence of this
gene among bacteria isolated from animal sources may

pose a serious threat to human health as these bacteria may
enter the food chain exposing general population to highly
resistant bacteria. Similar concerns were also expressed pre-
viously regarding ESBLs (Perez et al., 2007).

In the present study, we report detection of New Delhi
metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM) and ESBL genes in E. coli,
isolated from milk samples of clinical/subclinical mastitis
in cattle from West Bengal, India.

Materials and Methods

Bacterial strains
Eight E. coli isolates were obtained from milk samples col-
lected from clinical/subclinical mastitis cases originating in
adjoining areas of Kolkata during May 2012 to August 2012.
Status of mastitis (clinical/subclinical) was determined
(A. Singha, C. Guha, unpublished observation) by California
mastitis test as described previously (Radostits et al., 2007).

Phenotypic characterization

Isolates were presumptively identiﬁed by their growth on
eosine methylene blue agar (HiMedia, Mumbai, India) with
typical greenish metallic sheen and four other biochemical
tests (indole production, methyl red, Vogues Proskauer
and citrate utilization) employing routine bacteriological
techniques. Following presumptive identiﬁcation, isolates
were characterized by PhoenixTM 100 automated ID/AST
system (Becton and Dickinson, Tuas Avenue, Singapore)
for minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of various
antimicrobials employing Gram-negative combo panels
(NMICID-55) (Becton Dickinson).

PCR for antimicrobial resistance and shiga toxin genes

PCRs for blaTEM and blaCTX-M were performed with univer-
sal primers as described previously (Grobner et al., 2009)
with suitable modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, reactions were opti-
mized individually in 20 ll volumes with 10 pmol of each
primer. Reactions were annealed at 50.5 and 55°C for bla-
TEM and blaCTX-M, respectively. For blaNDM-1, PCR was per-
formed as described by Manchanda et al. (2011). In brief,
PCR was standardized in 20 ll volumes with 10 pmol of
forward and reverse primers. Primers were annealed at
59°C, and reaction was cycled for 35 times. PCR for shiga
toxin genes (stx1 and stx2) was optimized as described by
Paton and Paton (1998).

PCR amplicons from all reactions were electrophoresed
in 1.5% agarose gel and visualized under UV illumination
(DNR MiniLumi gel documentation system).

Sequencing

blaNDM-1 PCR amplicon was puriﬁed using AxyPrepTM PCR
Cleanup Kit (Axygen, Union City, CA, USA) and was

cloned using pGEM
as per manufacturer’s instruction. Sequencing was per-
formed in an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems,

Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) as per manu-
facturer’s

Results and Discussion

Phenotypic characterization of isolates
Eight isolates that were presumptively identiﬁed as E. coli
were conﬁrmed by PhoenixTM100 automated ID/AST
system along with generation of antimicrobial susceptibility

proﬁles. The resistance patterns
isolate
KOEC3 was resistant to almost all antimicrobials, and
isolate KOEC6 was also moderately resistant to the antimi-
crobials tested (Table 1).

revealed that

Minimum inhibitory concentrations data (Table 2) of
these two isolates (KOEC3 and KOEC6) indicated that the
isolate KOEC3 was susceptible to colistin and tetracycline
only and was intermediately susceptible to chlorampheni-
col. Although E. coli isolates can on occasion contain dif-
ferent resistance markers (Garcia-Fernandez et al., 2008),
isolates obtained from milk have not been reported previ-
ously with such widespread resistance, as in case of
KOEC3.

Moreover, the isolate KOEC3 was identiﬁed by Phoenix
100 as ‘potential carbapenemase’ producer, while two iso-
lates
and KOEC6) were ESBL producers
(Table. 2).

(KOEC3

Genotypic characterization

Characterization of isolates by PCR-targeting blaTEM (uni-
versal primer), PCR-targeting blaCTX-M (universal primer)
PCR-targeting blaNDM-1 yielded positive signal(s) in all eight
isolates for blaTEM, in only one isolate for blaCTX-M and in
one isolate for blaNDM. PCRs resulted in ampliﬁcation of
products of expected molecular weights (851 bp for blaTEM,
551 bp for line for blaCTX-M and 476 bp for blaNDM-1).

In 2009, Shahid et al., 2009. documented the incidence
of blaTEM and blaCTX-M in members of enterobacteriaceae
isolated from food samples and clinical samples in India in
their study reporting the predominance of occurrence of
blaTEM followed by blaCTX-M. In the present study, similar
trend was also noticed.

On the other hand, detection of blaNDM in an E. coli
isolate from milk was
rather unprecedented as was
observed in the present study. To further conﬁrm blaNDM,
the corresponding amplicon was cloned and sequenced,
and a homology search was made using BLAST algorithm
(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The sequence was submit-
ted to GenBank (accession no. KC769583). Result of
sequencing identiﬁed a 476-bp product and BLAST search
indicated 100% homology with blaNDM-5 gene of E. coli
(JN104597.1) and 99% homology with several sequences
including blaNDM-4 of E. coli (JQ348841.1) and blaNDM-1
of Acinetobacter baumannii (KC404829.1, KC347597.1),
Roultella
(JX680686.1), K. pneumoniae
(KC178689.1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (HF546976.1).

ornithinolytica

The isolate (KOEC3) bearing the blaNDM gene was
resistant to almost all antimicrobials (17 of 21) tested. How-
ever, susceptibility was observed for colistin (sensitive,
 1), tetracycline (sensitive, MIC ≤ 2 lg
MIC ≤ 0.5 lg ml
 1) and chloramphenicol (intermediate, MIC 16 lg
ml
 1) (Table 2). The MIC value of cefoperazone–sulbactam

aSIR interpretations were as per PhoenixTM 100 except those of colistin and cefoperazone-sulbactam.

could not be interpreted due to non-availability of an
appropriate guideline (Table 2). The isolate was obtained
from milk sample of a dairy cow suffering from mastitis,
but it was not clear whether the same isolate was the pri-
mary cause of mastitis in this animal or not. Neither
could we ascertain/trace the treatment history of the ani-
mal. We further screened the isolates for shiga toxin genes
(stx1 and stx2) as previously described by Paton and
Paton (1998) with minor modiﬁcations. Results indicated
that only one isolate (KOEC6 that was positive for ESBL
as per PhoenixTM 100) was positive for stx2, and none of
the isolates yielded ampliﬁcation for stx1. This was in
contrast to an earlier study reported by Momtaz et al.
(2012) who reported stx1 carrying E. coli
from bovine
mastitic milk. While studying a set of porcine E. coli iso-
lates, Boerlin et al. (2005) reported statistical association
between tetracycline resistance genes and estA virulence
genes possibly due to some degree of physical
linkages
between virulence genes and those responsible for drug
resistance (Martinez and Baquero, 2002). However,
in

isolates and low
our study due to limited number of
prevalence of shiga toxin genes, this hypothesis could not
be tested. The isolate carrying blaNDM-1 was not positive
for either of the genes (stx1 and stx2). While all isolates
signalled positive ampliﬁcation for blaTEM, not all were
identiﬁed as ESBL producer when tested in PhoenixTM100.
This was observed in 6 isolates. Although ESBL-producing
E. coli were previously reported from animal
sources
(Hunter et al., 2010), occurrence of blaNDM-1 gene was
reported only recently in Acinetobacter lwofﬁi
isolated
from chicken rectal swab (Wang et al., 2012) and E. coli
isolated from cat (Anonymous, 2012), and to the best of
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst detection of blaNDM gene
in an E. coli
isolate from milk samples of dairy cattle.
Because the isolate was obtained from mastitis milk sam-
ple, detection of blaNDM-1 was a matter of concern,
because from milk,
it might enter the food chain. As
carbapenems are not in veterinary usage in India, it may
be reasonably assumed that the gene has been horizontally
acquired by the mastitis milk isolate from human or

ble clonal
spread from human/environmental origin.
Considering the complexities of the aetiology of mastitis,
it becomes fundamentally important to investigate the
interplay and the causal relationships of
the various
microbial niches
involved. Occurrences of multidrug-
resistant bacteria in such samples could be reﬂective of
accidental adaptation of a hitherto naive microorganism
in a new target species, resulting in inadvertent establish-
ment of infections of enhanced resistance with human
health consequences.
