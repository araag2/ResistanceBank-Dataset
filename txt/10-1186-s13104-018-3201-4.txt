Abstract 
Objective:  To estimate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in indicator bacteria Escherichia coli and Enterococci 
isolated from duck faeces in Morogoro Municipality, Tanzania.
Results:  Escherichia coli and Enterococcus isolation rates from ducks faeces were 91 and 100% respectively. The 
prevalence of antibiotic resistance of E. coli and Enterococcus was 70.3 and 42%, respectively. E. coli resistant to four 
antibiotics were 28 (30.8%) and showed high resistance to ampicillin (81.3), tetracycline (75.8) and trimethoprim–sul-
phamethoxine (62.3). Multiple antibiotic resistance of Enterococcus were more than 65%. High resistance rates shown 
by Enterococcus were observed in rifampin (62%), ampicillin (62%) and tetracycline (42%). Almost all farmers (92.3%) 
left their ducks to scavenge for food around their houses. Antibiotics used in animal treatments were oxytetracyclines, 
sulfonamides, penicillin dihydrostreptomycin while in humans were tetracycline, ampicillin, and amoxicillin.

Introduction
Antibiotic resistance is an emerging world health prob-
lem  since  many  bacteria  have  developed  resistance  to 
commonly used antibiotics and the probable reasons are 
indiscriminate uses of these medicines. In Tanzania, anti-
biotics are used for the treatment of diseases in humans 
and  animals  and  as  prophylaxis  and  growth  promoters 
in  livestock  [1].  Uses  of  antibiotics  in  Tanzania  are  not 
controlled; patients and farmers can access any kind of 
these medicines over the counter without prescriptions 
[1]. In human medicine, the emergence of resistant bac-
teria is correlated to over-prescription of antibiotics [2]. 
The  ever-increasing  uses  of  antibiotics  are  a  problem 
in  human  medicine  and  livestock,  selection  pressure 
has  further  increased  the  advantage  of  the  bacteria  to

acquire,  maintain  and  disperse  resistant  genes  to  other 
bacterial populations [3].

Antibiotic  resistance  has  been  studied  using  indica-
tor  bacteria  like  Escherichia  coli  and  Enterococcus  spp. 
which showed good results [4, 5]. A study on antibiotic 
resistance in ducks in Tanzania showed high rate of mul-
tidrug-resistant  Campylobacter  jejuni  [6],  however,  no 
attempts were done to explain the possible predisposing 
factors neither the resistant in indicator bacteria. Other 
studies elsewhere on E. coli from ducks showed also high 
rates of multidrug resistance [7, 8]. Enterococci spp. has 
been  reported  to  show  high  resistance  to  vancomycin 
[9]. Despite the increase of interest in E. coli and Entero-
cocci spp. antibiotic resistance studies worldwide, there is 
no such studies in Tanzania. This study determined the 
prevalence of antibiotic resistance of E. coli and Entero-
cocci spp. isolated from the scavenging ducks (free rang-
ing) that are clinically healthy in Morogoro Municipality, 
Tanzania.

Methods
Study area and duck sampling
This  cross  sectional  study  was  conducted  in  Morogoro 
Municipality between November 2014 and March 2015 
where 100 Muscovy ducks (Carina moschata) were sam-
pled  from  26  backyard  flocks  [10].  Study  ducks  were 
randomly selected from each flock where 5–10% of the 
flock size was sampled [11]. The sampled birds included 
86  females  and  14  male  ducks.  Before  sampling,  basic 
information on management, feeding, uses and disposal 
of unused antibiotics were gathered using a questionnaire 
(Additional  file  1).  The  selected  ducks  were  manually 
restrained and a sterile cotton swab was inserted into clo-
aca to collect faecal materials. The samples were stored in 
cool box with ice pack and transported to the laboratory 
at Sokoine University of Agriculture for analysis. For con-
sistency, two researchers after were trained by the labora-
tory technologists on swab sampling from birds did the 
sampling to all the 100 ducks.

Isolation and identification of E. coli and Enterococci spp.
Faecal samples were plated on MacConkey agar (Oxoid, 
Basingstoke, UK) and incubated for 24 h under aerobic 
condition  for  isolation  of  E.  coli  [12].  Suspect  colonies 
were  further  identified  based  on  colonial  morphology, 
Gram  stain  and  biochemical  tests  [12].  For  isolation  of 
Enterococci spp., samples were plated on Slanetz-Bartley 
agar  (Oxoid,  Basingstoke,  UK)  and  incubated  for  48  h 
under  aerobic  condition  and  identification  based  on 
colonial  morphology  and  biochemical  tests  [9].  During 
isolation and identification, E. coli ATCC25922 and Ente-
rococcus  faecium  ATCC  2912  were  included  as  control 
strains.

Antibiotic susceptibility
All  the  E.  coli  and  Enterococci  isolates  were  tested  for 
antibiotic susceptibility using disk diffusion method and 
interpreted  according  to  the  CLSI  [13].  Antimicrobial 
susceptibility testing was performed to some antibiotics 
which are commonly used in human medicine in Tanza-
nia. Four antibiotics for E. coli were tested at indicated 
concentrations:  ampicillin  10  µg,  cefotaxime  30  µg,  tri-
methoprim–sulphamethoxine  25  µg  and  tetracycline 
30 µg. Enterococci were tested against ampicillin 10 µg, 
erythromycin 15 µg, rifampin 5 µg, tetracycline 30 µg and 
trimethoprim–sulfamethoxine  25  µg.  All  the  antibiotic 
discs were from Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK.

Ethical considerations
The  permission  to  carry  out  this  study  was  granted  by 
the  Morogoro  Municipal  Livestock  Officer  and  ethi-
cal  approval  for  the  study  was  given  by  the  Ethical 

Committees of Sokoine University of Agriculture, Tanza-
nia. Verbal consent was obtained from each of the farm-
ers prior to sampling.

Results
Out  of  100  faecal  samples  cultured  91%  had  E.  coli  of 
which 64 (70.3%) showed resistance to different antibiot-
ics tested (Table 1). Multiple antibiotic resistances shown 
by E. coli were: 28 (30.8%) isolates to four antibiotics, 35 
(38.5%) to three antibiotics, 13 (14.3%) to two antibiot-
ics,  11  (12.1%)  isolates  to  one  antibiotic.  Enterococcus 
was isolated from all the samples and 42% showed resist-
ance to different antibiotics tested. Five percent of Ente-
rococcus  isolates  were  resistant  to  all  antibiotics,  13% 
to four antibiotics, 21% to three antibiotics, 26% to two 
antibiotics and 28% to one antibiotic tested. Results on 
duck  management  and  their  possible  access  to  antibi-
otic residues are summarized in Table 2. Of the 26 farm-
ers interviewed, 92.3% managed ducks extensively where 
they  accessed  to  dumping  places.  No  administration  of 
veterinary drugs was reported to ducks but respondents 
reported  to  treat  other  animals  by  using  tetracyclines/
oxytetracycline.

Discussion
The  current  study  found  that  the  E.  coli  isolation  rates 
was  91%  while  all  ducks  haboured  Enterococci  and  the 
isolates had high rates of multi-antibiotic resistance. This 
study  shed  light  that  the  indicator  bacteria  from  free 
scavenging ducks in Tanzania can be used in studies of 
antibiotic  resistance.  This  suggests  that  the  problem  of 
antibiotic resistance is widespread even to bacteria iso-
lates from animals which do not receive antibiotic ther-
apy. This has a public health impact since ducks scavenge 
for the feed around homestead areas and shed their fae-
cal droppings all over and the resistant bacteria can find 
their way into the food chain and affect humans or the 
resistant gene can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria 
[14].

The estimated prevalence of antibiotic resistance in E. 
coli isolated during this study is comparable to resistance 
reported in Malaysia [15]. In Nigeria, a low prevalence of 
8.6% has been reported probably due to using different 
antibiotics like ofloxacin, nalidixic acid and gentamycin 
[7]. The high prevalence of antibiotic resistance observed 
during this study probably ducks are constantly exposed 
to antibiotic residues from animal and human discharges 
because of wide uses [1, 16]. Studies show that antibiotics 
used in the food animals are poorly absorbed in the gut 
and the parent compound are excreted in faeces [17–19]. 
This  is  supported  by  several  studies  that  have  reported 
high  levels  of  antibiotic  residues  in  sewage  and  animal 
wastes [20–24]. Therefore, the normal flora in scavenging 
ducks are constantly exposed to antibiotic residues which 
makes them develop resistance as it was observed during 
this study.

The E. coli resistance to ampicillin was the highest (81%) 
compared to other antibiotics used in the study similar to 

previous report in Slovakia where the resistance recorded 
was 87.8% [25]. Generally, studies show that 60–70% of E. 
coli isolates have developed resistance against ampicillin 
[18, 26]. This may be caused by too much uses of ampi-
cillin in human practice which its residues are potential 
sources  of  environmental  contaminations  where  ducks 
scavenge for feed. In case of sulphamethoxine, the resist-
ance  recorded  was  76%  as  previously  recorded  by  Van 
Tuat [27]. The antibacterial resistance shown by tetracy-
cline in this study was 59% while in Slovakia was 37.5% 
[8] and that of Nigeria was 75% [7]. Interestingly, E. coli 
also showed antibacterial resistance to cefotaxime at 63%, 
an antibiotic not commonly used in the treatment of the 
animals in Tanzania. Ducks may access cefotaxime resi-
dues in dumps where human faeces and disposed drug 
remains are found (Table 2). However, high resistance to 
cefotaxime has been observed with bacteria isolated from 
different health facilities sewerage [28].

Multiple resistances of E. coli to more than one antibi-
otic were also observed in the study. The findings were 
too  high  when  compared  with  the  study  conducted  in 
Vietnam  where  multiple  antibiotic  resistance  to  E.  coli 
was  16.7%  to  four  antibiotics,  to  three  antibiotics  20% 
and to two antibiotics was 23.3% [27]. This occurrence of 
multiple drugs resistance suggested that livestock played 
a role as reservoirs of resistant bacteria for environmen-
tal contamination [29]. It has been found that bacterial 
populations isolated from the gut of animals exposed to 
antibiotics were found to be five times more likely to be 
resistant to any given antibiotic. The non-resistant bac-
teria  normally  acquire  the  extra-chromosomal  antibi-
otic resistance plasmids (R-plasmids) from the resistant 
ones when are in close contact [18, 26, 30]. The observed 
resistance may be contributed by irrational use of antibi-
otics which discharges a substantial amount of residues 
to the environment. Other factors which cause the devel-
opment  of  resistance  could  be  the  easy  availability  and 
rampant  use  of  broad-spectrum  antibiotics  in  the  pre-
sumptive treatment of infections even in health facilities. 
Lack of enforcement of regulations on antibiotic use as 
a part of infection control programmes could have influ-
enced the pattern of resistance results to a considerable 
degree.

Enterococci spp. are natural commensals of the human 
and  animal  gut.  All  the  study  ducks  had  Enterococci 
spp. in their gut contents which showed 42% resistance 
rate  to  different  antibiotics  tested.  Nevertheless,  find-
ings from this study showed high resistance in rifampin 
(62%),  ampicillin  (62%)  and  tetracycline  (42%).  Multi-
drug resistance was also observed in more than 65% of 
the isolates. As earlier stated, the observed resistance of 
the bacteria to different antibiotics tested in absence of 
uses of the medicines in ducks could be due to residues 
discharged to the environment where ducks scavenge can 
easily get exposed to antibiotics and other resistant bac-
teria [20–24]. When resistant bacteria are in contact with 
the nonresistant ones, exchange of genetic materials can 
take place and the resistant gene can be acquired. Else-
where,  studies  have  reported  that  Enterococci  spp.  iso-
lated  from  ducks  showed  resistance  against  macrolides 
and lincosamide antibiotics [31–33]. Nevertheless, Ente-
rococci spp. is intrinsically resistant to several antibiotic 
groups including cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. In 
addition, many strains harbour transmissible genetic ele-
ments for acquired resistance to various antibiotics like 
tetracycline  [34].  Other  antibiotic  resistance  studies  in 
Enterococci  spp.  isolated  from  ducks  have  been  carried 
out using vancomycin antibiotic [9]. Further susceptibil-
ity studies of Enterococci spp. to vancomycin is suggested 
in future since the antibiotic is nowadays a common drug 
in human medicine in Tanzania.

The  questionnaire  study  further  supports  the  labora-
tory observation on high resistance rate shown by E. coli 
and  Enterococcus  spp.  It  was  observed  that  antibiotics 
are widely used in the treatment of animals and humans. 
Regardless of non-uses of veterinary drugs in dusks, the 
extensive scavenging management system exposes them 
to  the  environment  with  antibiotic  residues  and  other 
bacteria from animals and humans, which have been on 
antibiotics.  This  is  supported  by  the  findings  that  the 
observed  resistances  were  to  antibiotics  that  are  com-
monly used in humans and animals (Table 2). Resistance 
bacteria  have  been  isolated  from  the  variety  of  sources 
including  sewage  discharge  and  the  environment  [35–
37]. Drug remains and containers were haphazardly dis-
posed  of  in  the  household  surrounding  environments 
which  may  expose  ducks  to  the  antibiotic.  Therefore, 
the  intensive  management  system  of  ducks  can  help  to 
minimize the unnecessary exposure of birds to antibiotic 
residues.

Conclusion
Generally, antibiotic resistance shown by E. coli and Ente-
rococcus spp. in this study was high. This shows the role 
played  by  livestock  and  chicken  which  are  constantly 
on antibiotics as potential primary sources of antibiotic 
resistance genes to bacteria isolated from ducks. Isolat-
ing  multi-antibiotic  resistant  E.  coli  and  Enterococcus 
spp. from ducks serve as potential carriers of antibiotic-
resistant strains to humans and poses a serious problem 
to the public health.

Limitations
This  study  used  only  100  duck  samples  collected  from 
Morogoro  Municipality  which  limits  generalization  of 
the results to be used as representative on the status of 
antimicrobial  resistance  with  E.  coli  and  Enterococcus 
spp. in ducks in Tanzania. Also the numbers of antibiotic 
tested  were  few.  Testing  for  antibiotic  susceptibility  of 
bacteria using disk diffusion test method may be inferior 
to broth microdilution methods. Also, the study did not 
determine the resistance genotypes in E. coli and Entero-
coccus spp. which were resistant to different types of anti-
biotics.  Nevertheless,  presence  of  other  animals  on-site 
where duck sampling was done acts as confounding fac-
tors on the resistance rates observed in bacteria isolates 
from ducks.
