Staphylococcus aureus frequently isolated from milk products in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is a major 

pathogen responsible for food intoxication, human and animal diseases. SSA hospital-derived strains 

are  well  studied  but  data  on  the  population  structure  of  foodborne  S.  aureus  required  to  identify 

possible  staphylococcal  food  poisoning  sources  is  lacking.  Therefore,  the  aim  was  to  assess  the 

population genetic structure, virulence and antibiotic resistance genes associated with milk-derived S. 

aureus  isolates  from  Côte  d’Ivoire,  Kenya  and  Somalia  through  spa-typing,  MLST,  and  DNA 

microarray analysis. Seventy milk S. aureus isolates from the three countries were assigned to 27 spa 

(7 new) and 23 (12 new) MLST  sequence types. Milk-associated S. aureus of the three countries is 

genetically diverse comprising human and livestock-associated clonal complexes (CCs) predominated 

by the CC5 (n=10) and CC30 (n=9) isolates. Panton-Valentine leukocidin, toxic shock syndrome toxin 

and  enterotoxin  encoding  genes  were  predominantly  observed  among  human-associated  CCs. 

Penicillin, fosfomycin and tetracycline, but not methicillin resistance genes were frequently detected. 

Our findings indicate that milk-associated S. aureus in SSA originates from human and animal sources 

alike  highlighting  the  need  for  an  overarching  One  Health  approach  to  reduce  S.  aureus  disease 

burdens through improving production processes, animal care and hygienic measures.

1  Introduction 

Staphylococcus  aureus  can  asymptomatically  colonize  the  skin  and  nasal  cavities  of  humans  and 

animals.  Roughly  20%  of  humans  are  persistent  carriers  while  another  30%  are  considered  to  be 

intermittent carriers of S. aureus in the nasal vestibules (van Belkum et al., 2009). However, S. aureus 

is also responsible for a wide range of diseases in humans and animals, including skin and soft tissue 

infections,  mastitis,  severe  invasive  infections,  Staphylococcal  Food  Poisoning,  and  Toxic  Shock 

Syndrome (Tong et al., 2015). Pathogenicity, disease propagation and severity are largely influenced 

by a large variety of well characterized virulence factors such as the staphylococcal enterotoxins, toxic 

shock syndrome toxin (TSST-1), Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), adhesins  and immune evasion 

factors, capsule types, accessory gene regulator (agr) groups, proteases, DNases and lyases (Argudín 

et al., 2010; Krakauer and Stiles, 2013; Powers and Bubeck Wardenburg, 2014). However, while S. 

aureus is well characterized in the industrialized world, S. aureus is considered to be a neglected agent 

for disease in tropical and developing countries (Herrmann et al., 2013). This is despite the impact of 

S.  aureus  diseases  on  the  general  population,  healthcare,  food  and  livestock  production  systems  of 

many  communities  in  sub-Saharan  Africa  that  in  addition  share  a  lifestyle  of  close  daily  livestock 

interactions (Akindolire et al., 2015; Egyir et al., 2014a; Egyir et al., 2014b; Gitau et al., 2014; Maina 

et al., 2016; Njage et al., 2013). Livestock products of cow, camel or goat origin contribute to the daily 

food supply  in  sub-Saharan  Africa.  Especially  milk  products  including  fermented  milk  products  for 

increased  shelf  life  are  traditional  staple  food  items  in  sub-Saharan  Africa,  providing  important 

nutrients to pastoral and sedentarized communities (Elhadi et al., 2015; Iannotti and Lesorogol, 2014). 

High  prevalence  of  zoonotic  diseases,  poor  hygiene  and  production  processes  as  well  as  long 

transportation routes without cooling render these milk products highly susceptible to the outgrowth of 

foodborne  pathogens  including  S.  aureus  (Jans et al.,  2012;  Kouamé-Sina  et  al.,  2012;  Njage  et  al., 

2013; Noor et al., 2013). This is exemplified by a high presence of clinical and subclinical mastitis and

intramammary infections caused by S. aureus among dairy animals including camels in sub-Saharan 

Africa (Gitau et al., 2014; Issa et al., 2016; Regassa et al., 2013; Wanjohi et al., 2013). Furthermore, 

diarrhoea and vomiting in humans was especially associated with raw milk consumption (Kaindi et al., 

2012)  and  possibly  linked  to  the  high  prevalence  of  S.  aureus  in  these  milk  products  (Njage  et  al., 

2013).  Therefore,  increased  attention  to  foodborne  S.  aureus  is  required  especially  in  terms  of 

understanding  the  population  structure,  locally  important  lineages  and  their  virulence  factors  to 

formulate appropriate interventions. 

Population  structure  analysis  by  multi  locus  sequence 

typing  (MLST)  provides  important 

epidemiological  clues  on  emerging  highly  virulent  lineages  such  as  methicillin  resistant  S.  aureus 

(MRSA) and methicillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) as well as associated clonal complexes (CCs) 

100 

(Enright et al., 2000; Tong et al., 2015). There is some data available on the population structure of S. 

101 

aureus for human and healthcare-associated settings, revealing a predominance of CC5, CC30, CC152 

102 

and  typically  CC88-MRSA-IV  in  sub-Saharan  Africa  (Abdulgader  et  al.,  2015;  Schaumburg  et  al., 

103 

2014).  The  emergence  of  MRSA  in  Africa  is  visible,  but  still  significantly  lower  than  in developed 

104 

countries whereas PVL is highly prevalent, especially among MSSA isolates (Abdulgader et al., 2015; 

105 

Schaumburg  et  al.,  2014;  Schaumburg  et  al.,  2015).  While  the  presence  of  S.  aureus  and  antibiotic 

106 

resistances (ABR) including multi drug resistance (MDR) is well known in humans, animals and food 

107 

products in sub-Saharan Africa, knowledge on population structure and virulence factors of S. aureus 

108 

is still mostly limited to human and healthcare associated settings.  

109 

Therefore, the aim of this study is to provide a first insight into the population structure of S. aureus 

110 

from raw and fermented milk products as major vehicles of zoonotic infections in relation to human 

111 

and livestock-associated CCs. This was combined with a detailed investigation of virulence factor and 

112 

ABR  gene  carriage  in  order  to  understand  S.  aureus  epidemiology  and  public  health  risk  potential 

113 

within the tightly connected system of animals, food and humans in order to contribute towards the 

114 

implementation of a One Health approach in S. aureus and ABR control strategies.

2  Material and Methods 

116 

2.1  Milk sample origin 

117 

A  total  of  78  raw  and fermented  milk  samples  assigned into  subsets  1-3  were  incorporated into the 

118 

current  study  to  provide  first  insights  into  milk-associated  S.  aureus  of  geographically  different 

119 

regions of Africa, in particular S. aureus isolated from milk products from Kenya, Somalia and Côte 

120 

d’Ivoire. The milk samples were collected during three independent studies designed to investigate the 

121 

microflora of dairy products in these three East (Kenya and Somalia) and West (Côte d’Ivoire) African 

122 

countries. General characterization of subsets 1 and 2 milk samples including sample type, location, 

123 

physicochemical properties and microflora description were described in previous studies (Jans et al., 

124 

2012; Jans et al., 2013; Njage et al., 2013). Subset 1 (n=28, Kenya and Somalia) and 2 (n=15, Côte 

125 

d’Ivoire)  comprised  22  raw  and  21  fermented  milk  samples  collected  in  2007,  2008  and  2010 

126 

(Supplementary Table S1) that originated from camel (n=27), cow (n=15) and goat (n=1) milk. Subset 

127 

3 was collected and analysed independent of subsets 1 and 2 and the samples have not been previously 

128 

characterized. It comprised of raw milk samples collected from randomly selected camels from herds 

129 

in  Isiolo  (two  herds;  n=10)  and  Marsabit  (one  herd;  n=11),  as  well  as  milk  sampled  from  public 

130 

markets (n=14) in Garissa in Kenya during 2008. Sampling at each location was done on separate days 

131 

and the samples from camel herds comprised of pooled udder milk derived. Udders were disinfected 

132 

using 70% (v/v) ethanol and 3-4 strokes of foremilk were discarded prior to sample collection from all 

133 

four  quarters  into  sterile  50-mL  Falcon  tubes.  Market  raw  milk  samples  (n=14)  were  collected  in 

134 

sterile  50-mL  Falcon  tubes  and  processed  as  described  previously  (Jans  et  al.,  2012).  pH 

135 

measurements and California Mastitis Test (CMT) were performed on all samples of subset 3. 

136 

2.2  Staphylococcus spp. source, origin, isolation and enumeration in milk samples 

137 

Previously isolated S. aureus stored in glycerol stock at -80°C (n=52; subset 1; Njage et al., 2013) or 

138 

isolated  during  this  study  from  milk  samples  previously  not  screened  for  S.  aureus  (subset  2  and 

139 

subset 3; Jans et al., 2013) were examined. Subset 2 milk samples could only be qualitatively analysed 

140 

for this study since long term storage of milk samples at -20°C would have had an impact on bacterial 

141 

survival  to  allow  accurate  quantitative  analysis.  The  EN  ISO  6888-2  protocol  for  the  isolation  of 

142 

coagulase-positive  staphylococci  (ISO,  1999)  was  applied.  Presumptive  S.  aureus  isolates  obtained 

6 

 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT143 

based on colony morphology and presence of an opaque fibrin halo on rabbit plasma fibrinogen agar 

144 

(Oxoid, Basel, Switzerland) were transferred on to 5% sheep blood agar plates and incubated at 37°C 

145 

for 24 h. Post incubation, S aureus isolates were confirmed using the Staphaurex latex agglutination 

146 

test  (Oxoid,  Basel,  Switzerland).  In  case  of  the  subset  3  milk  sample  analysis  an  identical  isolation 

147 

approach as previously used for subset 1 was applied during field studies in Kenya using Baird Parker 

148 

agar  medium  supplemented  with  Egg  yolk  tellurite  (BP,  Biolife,  Milan, Italy)  and  incubation  under 

149 

aerobic conditions at 37°C for 2 days (Njage et al., 2013). Colonies of desired presumptive S. aureus 

150 

morphology  were  picked  and  streak  purified  on  BP  agar.  Enumeration  of  presumptive  S.  aureus 

151 

performed on the Kenyan subset 3 was performed using serial dilutions followed by plating onto BP 

152 

agar. Colonies of typical S. aureus morphologies on BP agar were further assessed using staphylase 

153 

test kit for coagulase reaction (Oxoid, Pratteln, Switzerland), Gram typing and catalase reaction. 

154 

2.3  DNA isolation 

155 

S. aureus isolates were cultivated in 10 ml Brain-Heart Infusion (BHI; Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) broth 

156 

until the stationary phase was reached by incubating at 37°C and 150 rpm shaking for 18-24 h. DNA 

157 

was  extracted  using  the  DNeasy  Blood  and  Tissue  Kit  (Qiagen,  Hilden,  Germany)  following  the 

158 

manufacturer’s instructions. 

159 

2.4  Spa typing and multi locus sequence typing 

160 

S. aureus isolates were subjected to spa typing by PCR amplification and sequencing of the spa gene 

161 

polymorphic X region as previously described (Johler et al., 2011). Spa types were assigned using the 

162 

spa-server (http://www.spaserver.ridom.de/). S. aureus-specific multi locus sequence typing (MLST) 

163 

was  performed  as  previously  described  (Enright  et  al.,  2000).  Quality  control  of  sequence  data, 

164 

assembly and comparison with the existing S. aureus MLST database (Jolley and Maiden, 2010) was 

165 

performed using CLC Genomic Workbench (v8.5.1, Qiagen Aarhus A/S, Denmark), MEGA 5.0 and 

166 

START2 (Jolley et al., 2001). Data visualization linked to phenotypes and metadata was performed in 

167 

PHYLOViZ v2.0 (Francisco et al., 2012). Analysis of phylogeny and assignment to clonal complexes 

168 

(CC)  was  performed  using  eBURSTv3  (Feil  et  al.,  2004).  The  assignment  of  an  ST  to  a  CC  was 

169 

calculated in eBURSTv3 according to defined requirements that 6 out of 7 loci must be shared with at 

170 

least one other member of the CC (Feil et al., 2004). Subgroups of CCs and the corresponding founder 

 

7 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT171 

ST  were  established  if  bootstrap  calculations  justified  the  subgroup  by  (a)  100%  or  (b)  for  ST 

172 

bootstrap  values  between  99-100%  if  the  suggested  founder  ST  was  not  an  SLV  of  an  existing 

173 

subgroup founder ST. Such subgroups were named using e.g. CC5-ST1, CC5-ST5 to avoid ambiguity 

174 

(Abdulgader  et  al.,  2015).  New  allele  sequences,  ST  definitions  and  metadata  of  all  corresponding 

175 

isolates were submitted to the S. aureus MLST database. For prevalence calculations, only one isolate 

176 

per ST per sample was considered. 

177 

To  associate  CC-STs  with  metadata,  the  complete  MLST  database  was  downloaded  (pubmlst.org 

178 

accession  date  04-April-2016).  For  grouping  and  analysis  purpose,  descriptions  for  sample  source, 

179 

host and geographic origin were unified based on data entries presented in the database to use identical 

180 

terminologies.  Due  to  lack  of  clarity  in  the  original  database  on  host  (animal  or  human)  source, 

181 

isolates  assigned  to  a  host  with  “carrier”  for  disease,  “community  acquired”  or  detailed  medical 

182 

diagnostics were interpreted as “possible human origin”. 

183 

2.5  DNA microarray and SplitsTree analysis 

184 

Based on spa types determined, 66 S. aureus isolates were selected and subjected to DNA microarray 

185 

analysis (Monecke et al., 2008). The Staphytype genotyping kit 2.0 (Alere, Jena, Germany) was used 

186 

for DNA microarray analysis in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. An ArrayMate reader 

187 

(Alere, Jena, Germany) was used for signal acquisition. Similarities in virulence and resistance gene 

188 

profiles were visualized using SplitsTree4 (http://www.splitstree.org) (Wattinger et al., 2012). 

189 

For  CC-based  DNA  microarray  analysis  of  the  66  S.  aureus  isolates,  CC-assignments  derived  from 

190 

MLST  were  used  for  all  isolates  for  which  MLST  was  performed  (n=40)  due  the  enhanced 

191 

discrimination  power  of  MLST.  Isolates  without  MLST  data  available  (n=16),  CCs  were  assigned 

192 

based  on  the  MLST-CC  association  with  other  isolates  featuring  the  identical  DNA  microarray-CC 

193 

designation. If the association was ambiguous, isolates were assigned to DNA microarray determine 

194 

CCs only.  

195 

2.6  Antibiotic susceptibility testing 

196 

Isolates harbouring genes for b -lactam, tetracycline, aminoglycoside and chloramphenicol resistance 

197 

were subjected to phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility tests using the disc diffusion test. Resistances to 

198 

ampicillin,  tetracycline,  gentamicin,  and  chloramphenicol  were  determined  based  on  zones  of 

 

8 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT199 

inhibition  on  Mueller-Hinton  Agar  in  accordance  with  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards  Institute

3  Results 

202 

3.1  Prevalence of S. aureus isolates in milk samples 

203 

Eighty presumptive S. aureus isolates were isolated from the 78 raw and fermented milk samples that 

204 

originated  from  Kenya  (n=46)  and  Somalia  (n=17;  East  Africa)  and  Côte  d’Ivoire  (n=15;  West 

205 

Africa). A total of 70 of these isolates were subsequently confirmed as S. aureus on further primary 

206 

testing. Overall, S. aureus was isolated from 43 (55%) of the 78 milk samples with a distribution of 

207 

60% (42/70) and 40% (28/70) of the isolates being recovered from raw and fermented milk products, 

208 

respectively (Fig. 1A). At specific country level there were 47 (67%), 8 (11%) and 15 (21%) isolates 

209 

obtained from Kenyan, Somali and Ivorian milk products respectively. Except for one isolate from a 

210 

goat milk sample, all isolates from Kenya and Somalia were of camel milk origin, whereas all Ivorian 

211 

isolates were recovered from bovine milk samples (Fig. 1B).  

212 

3.2  Cell counts and pH of milk samples of subset 3 

213 

This subset was comprised of 35 raw camel milk samples collected directly at herd level (Isiolo and 

214 

Marsbit) as well as from public markets (Garissa) at three locations in Kenya. Mean cell counts on BP 

215 

agar were log10 2.46±0.86 CFU mL-1 and log10 4.41±0.89 CFU mL-1 for the direct herd level (n=21) 

216 

and  public  market  (n=14)  sampled  milk,  respectively.  The  mean  pH  values  for  these  two  sample 

217 

groups were 6.56±0.27 and 6.51±0.09, respectively. Four herd level and one public market collected 

218 

milk  sample  yielded  positive  results  in  the  CMT  assay.  A  total  of  33  isolates  with  presumptive  S. 

219 

aureus  morphology  isolated  from  these  milk  samples  were  also  Gram-,  catalase-  and  coagulase-

220 

positive. Out of this presumptive S. aureus isolate pool, isolates ILS-53, ILS-54 and ILS-55 confirmed 

221 

as S. aureus using the Staphaurex test were subsequently isolated from BP agar petri dishes with 10-30 

222 

colonies and a final CFU count of log10 5.25, log10 5.39 and log10 4.58 CFU mL-1, respectively. 

223 

3.3 

spa typing of S. aureus isolates 

224 

A total of 27 spa types were detected among the 70 S. aureus isolates including seven new spa types: 

225 

t14847, t14869, t14892, t15154, t15155, t15156 and t15157 (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). 

226 

Two  Kenyan  raw  camel  milk  isolates  could  not  be  typed  because  their  spa  genes  could  not  be 

9 

 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT227 

amplified  by  different  available  spa  typing  PCR  primers.  These  spa  types  mostly  showed  distinct 

228 

geographical distribution between and within the three countries with 18, 2 and 8 spa types assigned to 

229 

Kenyan,  Somali and  Ivorian  milk  S. aureus  isolates,  respectively.  The  most  frequent  spa  type  from 

230 

Kenyan isolates was t6521, whereas spa types t14847 and t289 predominated among the Somali and 

231 

Ivorian isolates, respectively. Of the new spa types, five (t14869, t14892, t15155, t15156 and t15157) 

232 

were exclusively detected in Kenya, one (t14847) was assigned to a Somali camel milk isolate only, 

233 

and there was one new spa type (t15154) shared among camel and bovine milk isolates recovered from 

234 

Kenya  (Isiolo)  and  Côte  d’Ivoire  (Songon),  respectively.  Spa  type  t318  was  recovered  in  Nanyuki, 

235 

Garissa,  Isiolo  and  Marsabit,  t3519  from  Mandera,  Garissa  and  Isiolo,  and  t6521  from  Isiolo  and 

236 

Nanyuki  milk  products.  In  Côte  d’Ivoire  the  isolates  assigned  to  spa  type  t084  were  isolated  from 

237 

Bingerville and Lievre rouge milk samples.

3.4  S. aureus population structure analysis by DNA microarray and MLST 

239 

3.4.1  Population structure assessed by DNA microarray & SplitsTree analysis 

240 

Genetic population structure of the Kenyan, Somali and Ivorian milk S. aureus isolates was assessed 

241 

based on the DNA microarray hybridization profiles. To achieve this, 66 isolates selected based on spa 

242 

type distribution and sample origin were analysed. Of these isolates, 59 were clustered into 11 CCs 

243 

and 2 singletons, leaving 7 isolates with previously unobserved hybridization profiles that could not be 

244 

assigned to CCs or STs based on homology with the hybridization profiles of the reference database 

245 

(Table 2 and Supplemental Table 1). A SplitsTree constructed based on the virulence and resistance 

246 

gene profiles of the isolates showed that a genetically diverse S. aureus population was associated with 

247 

camel  and  bovine  milk  products  sampled  in  Kenya,  Somalia  and  Côte  d’Ivoire  featuring  a  high 

248 

diversity of CCs, agr types and capsule types (Fig. 2). Furthermore, a clear genetic separation of the 

249 

Ivorian  (West  Africa)  from  the  Kenyan  and  Somali  (East  Africa)  isolates  was  observed,  with  the 

250 

exception of the CC5-ST5 cluster, which included both Kenyan and Ivorian isolates. 

251 

3.4.2  Population structure determined by MLST 

252 

A total of 40 S. aureus isolates were selected based on spa types and sample origin to cover the entire 

253 

population  diversity  of  isolates  (Supplementary  Table  S1)  and  processed  by  MLST  analysis.  These 

254 

isolates  were  assigned  to  STs  and  CCs  that  are  distributed  across  the  entire  pool  of  the  currently 

 

10 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT255 

publicly  available  S.  aureus  STs  (Figure  2).  The  isolates  were  assigned  to  23  STs  predominated  by 

256 

ST30 (n=5) and ST2957 (n=4). At CC level, most isolates belonged to CC5 (27.8%, n=10) followed 

257 

by CC30 (25%, n=9). CC5 was split into ST-clusters of CC5-ST5 (n=4), CC5-ST6 (n=1), CC5-ST15 

258 

(n=2),  CC5-ST72  (n=1)  and  CC5-ST97  (n=2).  All  members  of  CC30  were  either  ST30  or  SLV  of 

259 

ST30 (Supplementary Table S1). 

260 

A  total  of  12  new STs  were  defined  by  17 isolates  originating  from  Kenya  (n=12,  8  STs),  Somalia 

261 

(n=2, 1 ST) and Côte d’Ivoire (n=3, 3 STs). Among these new STs, ST2013 and ST2077 represented 

262 

new combinations of existing alleles. ST1738, ST1741, ST1742, ST1765, ST1781, ST1952, ST2073, 

263 

ST2076, ST2080 and  ST2094 were defined by new arc, aroE, glpF, gmk, pta and yqiL alleles. The 

264 

new STs comprised 3 singletons (ST1741, ST1952 and ST2094) (Supplementary Table S1). New STs 

265 

were  predominantly  related  to  CC5-ST5  (ST1741,  ST2013,  ST2076  and  ST2077)  albeit  at  levels 

266 

ranging from SLV to 6LV. While ST1741 and ST2013 were related to CC5-ST5 as 6LV and SLV, 

267 

respectively,  ST2076  and  ST2077  were  TLV  of  CC5-ST9.  ST1742,  ST2080  and  ST2094  were 

268 

associated  with  CC130  (SLV),  CC30  (SLV)  and  CC88  (DLV),  respectively.  ST2073  and  ST1765 

269 

shared  a  DLV  association  with  CC425.  ST1952  was  closest  associated  with  CC398  at  4LV  level. 

270 

ST1738 and ST1781 were closest associated with CC707 at 5LV level (Supplementary Table S1). 

271 

3.4.3  Comparison of CCs associations determined by MLST and DNA microarray 

272 

CC assignment of isolates determined as members of CC5-ST5 (n=6), CC5-ST97 (n=2), CC5-ST72 

273 

(n=1),  CC5-ST6  (n=1),  CC5-ST15  (n=2),  CC30  (n=10),  CC101  (n=2),  CC152  (n=1),  CC522  (n=1) 

274 

were  also  identified  as  members  of  the  corresponding  CC  based  on  DNA  microarray  hybridization 

275 

(Supplementary  Table  S1).  ST  identification  on  the  other  hand  was  less  reliable  resulting  in  the 

276 

ST2957  isolates  ILS-08,  ILS-54,  ILS-58  and  ILS-60  being  identified  as  ST39  on  DNA  microarray 

277 

data. Ambiguous identification of ST97 and ST15 but still within the same CC5 was observed for ILS-

278 

20,  ILS-32,  ILS-73  and  ILS-79.  CC130  was  correctly  identified  for  ILS-37  whereas  the  other  two 

279 

isolates ILS-12 and ILS-15 were assigned into another cluster that comprise both CC30 and CC130 

280 

strains (Fig 2). It should however be noted that such assignments were associated with low assignment 

281 

scores due to limited availability of reference microarray hybridization profiles from African S. aureus 

282 

populations  that  are  currently  available  on  this  platform  (Supplementary  Table  S1).  New  ST1738 

 

11 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT283 

(ILS-03 and ILS-67) and ST1781 (ILS-23, ILS-24 and ILS-26) were identified as their closest existing 

284 

DLV  relative  ST1755.  ST1765  (ILS-17)  and  ST2094  (ILS-78)  were  assigned  to  CC425  and  CC88, 

285 

respectively,  which  represents  their  closest  CC  founders  at  DLV  level.  Singleton  ST1741  (ILS-04) 

286 

was identified as CC130 member whereas ST1952 (ILS-49), ST2076 (ILS-70) and ST2077 (ILS-72) 

287 

could not be identified via DNA microarrays.  

288 

3.4.4  Population structure in relation to location, livestock and human association 

289 

The  complementary  dataset  of  population  structure  obtained  from  DNA  microarray  and  MLST  was 

290 

also  used  to  assess  the  relationships  between  isolates  and  sample  metadata.  Geographical  origin  of 

291 

isolates  correlated  with  CC  distribution.  CC101,  CC130,  CC30,  CC522-ST96  and  novel  CC3304, 

292 

CC3305, ST3307 and ST3308 were only assigned to isolates of Kenya and Somalia, whereas CC152, 

293 

CC3311  and  ST3314  were  only  assigned  to  those  of  Côte  d’Ivoire.  Healthcare-associated  CC5 

294 

members  formed  the  exception  and  were  assigned  to  isolates  of  East  and  West  African  sampling 

295 

regions (Supplementary Table S1). However, CC5 when grouped by CC-STs separated also according 

296 

to  sampling  regions  into  CC5-ST15  and  CC5-ST72  assigned  to  Ivorian  isolates  vs.  CC5-ST6  and 

297 

CC5-ST97 assigned to Kenyan isolates with only CC5-ST5 still comprised of isolates of Côte d’Ivoire 

298 

and Kenya (Supplementary Table S1).  

299 

Isolates  were  analysed  with  regard  to  human-  and  livestock-associated  CCs.  According  to  literature 

300 

and the metadata of the MLST database, CC101, CC152, CC1781, CC30, CC5-ST5, CC5-ST15, CC5-

301 

ST72,  CC88,  ST1741  and  ST2094  were  considered  human-associated  CCs.  In  contrast,  CC130, 

302 

CC1765,  CC2076,  CC522,  CC5-ST6,  CC5-ST97  and  ST1952  were  considered  livestock-associated 

303 

CCs. Of the 66 DNA microarray processed isolates, 62 isolates with CC assignments were obtained of 

304 

which 27 and 35 were assigned to livestock and human-associated CCs, respectively. Similarly, CC 

305 

assignment  also  correlated  to  raw  milk  and  fermented  milk  origin  of  the  isolates  with  only  CC130, 

306 

CC30 and CC5-ST5 forming clusters with isolates from both sample types (Supplementary Table S1). 

307 

3.5  Prevalence of selected virulence factors determined by DNA microarray 

308 

CC association determined by MLST (n=40) was used to cluster DNA microarray data (n=66). Only 4 

309 

isolates  could  not  be  assigned  to  a  known  genetic  lineage  as  they  exhibited  previously  unobserved 

 

12 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT310 

hybridization  profiles  and  were  not  among  the  strains  processed  by  MLST  (Table  2  and 

311 

Supplementary Table S1). 

312 

3.5.1  Toxins 

313 

Genes  associated  with  different  leukocidins  including  Panton-Valentine  leukocidin  (PVL)  were 

314 

detected among the 66 isolates analysed by DNA microarray. lukF, hlgA and lukS were most prevalent 

315 

being detected in 66 (100%), 66 (100%) and 65 (96%) isolates tested, respectively. lukY and lukX were 

316 

detected in 50 (76%) and 52 (79%) isolates, respectively, whereas 40 (61%) isolates harboured lukY 

317 

and  lukX.  lukD  and  lukE  were  harboured  by  38  (58%)  and  30  (45%)  isolates,  respectively.  PVL 

318 

encoding  genes lukF-PV  and lukS-PV were detected in 4 (6%) isolates. While  PVL-encoding genes 

319 

were exclusively found in human-associated CCs, lukD, lukX and lukY displayed a higher prevalence 

320 

(85-95%) in livestock compared to (37-65%) human-associated isolates (Table 2 and Supplementary 

321 

Table S1). 

322 

Genes for toxic shock syndrome toxin tst1 were detected in 4 (6%) isolates. All isolates harboured the 

323 

human tst1 allele, however, except for CC5-ST5 (1 isolate), the other two isolates of CC522 and CC5-

324 

ST6  shared  a  higher  association  with  livestock.  Staphylococcal  enterotoxins  were  detected  in 

325 

approximately  1/3  of  the  isolates  analysed  (Table  2  and  Supplementary  Table  S1).  The  enterotoxin 

326 

gene  cluster  (egc,  comprising  seg,  sei,  sem,  sen,  seo,  seu)  was  most  prevalent  and  exclusively  to 

327 

isolates (37%) of the human-associated CCs. Seh was detected as single enterotoxin in isolates (15%) 

328 

of  livestock-associated  CCs,  whereas  sea  was  detected  in  both  isolates  of  human  and  livestock-

329 

associated  CCs.  While  isolates  of human-associated  CCs  carried  the egc  cluster,  those  of livestock-

330 

associated  CCs  lacked  it  (Table  2  and  Supplementary  Table  S1).  Genes  encoding  for  the  epidermal 

331 

cell differentiation inhibitor B (edinB) were detected in over 40% of livestock-associated CC130 and 

332 

CC2076 isolates, but in only one isolate of the human-associated CC152. Two CC2076 as well as 2 

333 

isolates without CC or ST assignment harboured the edinB in combination with the exfoliative toxin 

334 

D, while a single CC152 isolate was positive for edinB and PVL genes (Supplementary Table S1). 

335 

3.5.2  Accessory gene regulator (agr) groups and capsule types 

336 

All  66  isolates  harboured  agr  genes  with  clear  association  to  clonal  complexes.  CC101,  CC152, 

337 

CC522,  CC5-ST6,  CC5-ST72,  CC5-ST97,  CC1781  and  ST1952  comprising  nearly  50%  of  isolates 

 

13 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT338 

from livestock-associated CCs were affiliated to agrI compared to only 11-37% of isolates from the 

339 

human-associated  CCs.  CC5,  CC5-ST15  and  CC1765  belonged  to  agrII.  agrIII  was  harboured  by 

340 

CC130, CC2076, CC30, CC88, ST1741 and ST2094 isolates and thus equally shared among human 

341 

and  livestock-associated  CCs.  agrIV  was  harboured  by  CC5-ST6,  CC5-ST72,  CC5-ST97,  CC101, 

342 

CC152,  CC522  and  CC1781.  With  the  exception  of  agrB-IV,  agrII  and  agrIV  were  predominantly 

343 

found  in  isolates  of  human  associated  CCs  (Supplementary  Table  S1).  Fifty-three  percent  (36/66; 

344 

CC5-ST72,  CC5-ST97,  CC5-ST5,  CC5-ST8,  CC30  (1  isolate  only,  also  cap8),  CC152,  CC1765, 

345 

CC1781, CC2076 and ST1952) of the isolates belonged to capsule type 5, whilst 47% (31/66; CC5-

346 

ST15,  CC5-ST6,  CC30,  CC130,  CC522,  CC101,  CC15,  CC88,  ST1741  and  ST2094)  isolates  were 

347 

affiliated to capsule type 8 (Supplementary Table S1). Capsule types were equally distributed between 

348 

livestock and human associated CCs. 

349 

3.5.3  Antibiotic resistance genes 

350 

At  least  one  antibiotic  resistance  gene  was  detected  in  43  (65%)  of  the  66  camel  and  bovine  milk 

351 

derived  S.  aureus  isolates.  This  included  28  (57%)  Kenyan,  2  (25%)  Somali  and  13  (87%)  Ivorian 

352 

isolates  (Table  2  and  Supplementary  Table  S1).  The  resistance  genes  were  associated  with  87% 

353 

(13/15) bovine (Côte d’Ivoire) and 53% (30/57) camel (Kenya and Somalia) milk isolates. Fifty-six 

354 

percent (24/43), 30% (13/43), 12% (5/43) and 2% (1/43) of the resistance isolates harboured one, two, 

355 

three and four antibiotic resistance genes, respectively, yielding 44% (19/43) as presumptive MDR S. 

356 

aureus.  

357 

The  fosB  gene  encoding  fosfomycin  resistance  predominated  being  detected  in  67%  (29/43)  of 

358 

resistant  isolates  that  included  19  (19/49;  39%)  Kenyan,  2  (2/8;  25%)  Somali  and  8  (8/15;  53%) 

359 

Ivorian isolates. The tetracycline resistance  gene tetK was the second most frequent resistance  gene 

360 

harboured by 49% (21/43) of resistant isolates that represented 18% (9/49) Kenyan and 80% (12/15) 

361 

Ivorian milk isolates. The b -lactamase resistance operon (blaZ/I/R) was detected in 37 % (16/43) of 

362 

the  resistant isolates  comprising  11  (11/49;  22%)  Kenyan,  1  (1/8;  13%)  Somali,  and  4  (4/15;  27%) 

363 

Ivorian  milk  isolates.  Resistance  genes  involved  in  aminoglycoside  (aadD),  chloramphenicol  (fexA) 

364 

and  streptogramin  (vga-BM  3327)  resistance  were  only  found  in  single  isolates.  The  fexA  gene  in 

365 

combination  with  fosB  and  b -lactamase  operon  genes  occurred  in  a  Kenyan  camel  milk  isolate, 

 

14 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT366 

whereas  an  Ivorian  bovine  milk  isolate  harboured  aminoglycoside  fosfomycin,  tetracycline  and  b -

367 

lactam  resistance  genes.  The  streptogramin  resistance  vga-BM  3327  was  found  in  a  single  Ivorian 

368 

bovine  milk  isolate.  No  isolate  harboured  any  of  the  other  antibiotic  genes  queried  on  the  DNA 

369 

microarray  including  the  methicillin  and  vancomycin  resistance  genes.  But  all  the  66  isolates 

370 

harboured  the  sdrM  gene  encoding  for  a  multidrug  efflux  pump.  Isolates  harbouring  genes  for 

371 

tetracycline,  b -lactam  (ampicillin),  chloramphenicol  and  aminoglycoside  (gentamicin)  resistance 

372 

genes  were  confirmed  to  be  phenotypically  resistant  to  corresponding  antibiotics  using  the  disc 

373 

diffusion test (Supplementary Table S1). 

374 

4  Discussion 

375 

In this study, we have examined 70 S. aureus isolates recovered from raw and fermented milk sampled 

376 

in  Côte  d’Ivoire,  Kenya  and  Somalia.  These  isolates  were  characterized  based  on  spa  typing  (70 

377 

isolates),  DNA  microarray  hybridization  (66  isolates)  and  MLST  (40  isolates)  providing  further 

378 

insights into the genetic population structure of milk-associated S. aureus in three African countries. 

379 

Several new spa-types as well as MLST STs including new alleles were revealed. In agreement with 

380 

previous observations from other parts of the world, the CC and spa-types t002, t084, t186 and t355 

381 

association  were  further  confirmed  among  African  isolates  of  CC5-ST5,  CC5-ST15,  CC88  and 

382 

CC152, respectively (Schaumburg et al., 2015). 

383 

MSSA members of CC5-ST5, CC5-ST8, CC5-ST15, CC30, CC121 and CC152, and MRSA members 

384 

of  CC5-ST5,  CC5-ST8,  CC80,  CC88  and  CC5-ST239/241  occur  frequently  in  African  hospital 

385 

environments  with  CC5  being  the  most  prevalent  CC  for  MSSA  and  MRSA  across  Africa 

386 

(Abdulgader  et  al.,  2015;  Schaumburg  et  al.,  2014).  Genetic  diversity  among  the  tested  isolate 

387 

collection was large and distributed across the entire current MLST scheme including bovine, camel 

388 

and human-associated lineages as well as new members for CC-ST5 (ST2013), CC30 (ST2080) and 

389 

CC152 (ST152) representing the most prevalent African CCs (Abdulgader et al., 2015; Schaumburg et 

390 

al., 2014) and 49% (32/66) of the analysed isolates. 

391 

Several  novel  STs  including  ST1738,  ST1741,  ST1781  and  ST2094  detected  in  our  study  revealed 

392 

could not be linked at SLV level to any existing CC, yielding singletons that required a wider analysis 

393 

approach in order to obtain potential relationships. Novel ST2094 was closest related to CC88 at DLV 
15 

 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT394 

level. A second isolate processed by DNA microarray only also related closest to CC88 but due to the 

395 

absence of MLST data, was not further typed. CC88 comprises a typical sub-Saharan African MRSA 

396 

clone  ST88-MRSA-III/IV  (Schaumburg  et  al.,  2014)  for  which  the  MSSA  clones  revealed  by  this 

397 

study  provides  valuable  comparative  isolates.  ST1738  and  ST1781  were  closest  associated  with 

398 

CC707 at 5LV level. CC707 is a small CC comprised of only 9 members mainly from nasal and skin 

399 

swabs  originating  from  rural  and  clinical  environment  in  Ghana  (Egyir  et  al.,  2014a;  Egyir  et  al., 

400 

2014b)  but  also  human  samples  in  Côte  d’Ivoire,  the  Gambia,  China,  Brazil,  Canada  and  Europe. 

401 

Interestingly, ST1738 and ST1781 were connected to CC707 via ST1755 of an MSSA isolate from the 

402 

United Arab Emirates indicating close relationship and shared camel habitat between these three ST. 

403 

ST1741 was closest related to CC-ST5 albeit at 6LV level, but as such still potentially related to the 

404 

main  human  and  hospital  associated  CC  in  Africa.  Although  not  within  the  strict  CC  definitions, 

405 

broader analysis can thus reveal interesting potential connections to initiate subsequent investigations. 

406 

Besides  human  and  healthcare  associated  CCs,  several  livestock-associated  CCs  (CC5-ST9,  CC425, 

407 

CC5-ST97,  CC130,  CC522,  CC130-ST1742)  were  obtained  (Becker  et  al.,  2014;  Fitzgerald  and 

408 

Holden, 2016; Graveland et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2005). Meanwhile the detection of several CC130 

409 

isolates  from  camel  milk  suggests  that  camels  are  also  associated  with  this  CC  and  not  only  small 

410 

ruminants (Merz et al., 2016). Similarly, bovine mastitis relevant CC5-ST97 lineages (Fitzgerald and 

411 

Holden, 2016) also seem to affect camels, likely contributing to mastitis. 

412 

Direct  relationships  to  such  livestock-associated  CCs  were  detected  at  SLV  level  for  several  STs. 

413 

However, widened analyses of novel STs beyond SLV level suggested closest relationships of many 

414 

of these novel STs to livestock-associated CCs. This included ST1765 and ST2073 at DLV level to 

415 

CC425; ST2076 and ST2077 at TLV level to CC5-ST9 and ST1952 at 4LV level to the predominant 

416 

livestock-associated CC398 lineage (Köck et al., 2013; Smith, 2015; Ye et al., 2016). 

417 

The  S.  aureus  population  structure  detected  in  milk  products  in  this  study  with  members  of 

418 

hospital/human-associated  CCs  as  well  as  livestock-associated  CCs  suggests  different  sources  and 

419 

cross-contamination for S. aureus presence in milk. Human-related contamination of milk along  the 

420 

supply chain seems to play an important role in S. aureus dissemination from humans to milk, further 

421 

to other humans and likely also to livestock described as cross-circulation of environmental, hospital 

 

16 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT422 

and livestock isolates (Lin et al., 2016; Schaumburg et al., 2015). In addition, the livestock-associated 

423 

CCs suggest that a second source of S. aureus contamination of milk occurs directly from the animal 

424 

e.g. in the case of subclinical mastitis. Our data on S. aureus levels in along the milk supply chain in 

425 

Kenyan  subset  3  samples  showed  low  initial  S.  aureus  counts  of  raw  milk,  but  rising  to  potential 

426 

health  concerning  levels  of  over  105  CFU/mL  by  the  time  the  milk  products  reached  the  market. 

427 

Therefore,  regardless  of  the  source  of  contamination,  increased  awareness  is  required  to  minimize 

428 

contamination  through  diagnosis  and  treatment  of  infected  animals  followed  by  improved  hygiene 

429 

practises and prevention of bacterial growth during processing and storage. 

430 

ABRs  are  a major problem regarding the treatment of S. aureus infections. Consistent with the low 

431 

MRSA  prevalence  reported  in  sub-Saharan  Africa  (Maina  et  al.,  2016;  Omuse  et  al.,  2014; 

432 

Schaumburg  et  al.,  2015),  MRSA  were  not  detected  in  this  study.  However,  all  MSSA  described 

433 

carried a multi drug efflux pump and most carried additional ABR genes, in particular genes encoding 

434 

for  penicillin  (27%),  tetracycline  (33%)  and  fosfomycin  (42%)  resistances.  This  corresponds  with 

435 

previously  reported high prevalence of penicillin and tetracycline resistances in S. aureus of human 

436 

and dairy origin including rural, urban and hospital environments in sub-Saharan Africa (Aiken et al., 

437 

2014; Egyir et al., 2014a; Egyir et al., 2014b; Schaumburg et al., 2014; Shitandi and Sternesjö, 2004). 

438 

However in this study, the presence of fosB was detected in nearly 2/3 of all human-associated CCs 

439 

isolates but only in below 15% of livestock-associated CCs. Similar findings were obtained for tetK 

440 

that  was  more  prevalent  among  human-associated  isolates  whereas  genes  encoding  for  penicillin-

441 

resistance displayed a higher prevalence among livestock-associated CCs. These data possibly indicate 

442 

exposure to different antibiotics in human and veterinary settings to yield different selection pressures. 

443 

 Although  fosfomycin  resistance  genes  at  such  high  prevalence  have  been  previously  reported  an 

444 

observation that might be of concern if such genes confer phenotypic resistance is the fact that some 

445 

isolates carrying these genes also harbour pvl-and tst1 genes. This might be problematic considering 

446 

the  revived  activities  of  promoting  fosfomycin  for  veterinary  use  and  as  a  potential  treatment  of 

447 

MRSA infections such as  skin infections (Pérez et al., 2014; Popovic et al., 2010). Therefore, ABR 

448 

awareness and judicious use of antibiotic therapy in humans and livestock should be encouraged.

Virulence  factors  significantly  differed  between  the  two  groups  especially  for  staphylococcal 

450 

enterotoxins,  tst1  and  PVL,  which  with  the  exception  of  tst1,  were  less  frequently  detected  among 

451 

isolates  of  livestock-associated  CCs  (Cuny  et  al.,  2015).  PVL  is  a  concerning  virulence  factor 

452 

contributing  to  soft  tissue  and  skin  infections.  It  has  mostly  been  detected  in  human  or  hospital-

453 

associated  S.  aureus  isolates  including  S.  aureus  in  Africa  (Abdulgader  et  al.,  2015)  or  in  strains 

454 

assigned  to  livestock-associated  MRSA  (Ünal  et  al.,  2012).  Recently,  the  detection  of  pvl-positive 

455 

isolates in Columbian cheese (Herrera et al., 2016), in camel meat in Saudi Arabia (Raji et al., 2016) 

456 

and  in  camel  milk  in  the  United  Arab  Emirates  (Monecke  et  al.,  2011)  was  reported.  Sub-Saharan 

457 

Africa  is  considered  to  be  an  endemic  region  for  pvl-positive  S.  aureus,  the  majority  of  which  are 

458 

MSSA (Schaumburg et al., 2014). The pvl-positive S. aureus identified in this study belong to MSSA 

459 

strains of CC5-ST15, CC30 and CC152, which represent typical PVL-CCs of sub-Saharan Africa and 

460 

support the reports on high prevalence of PVL carrying MSSA in African countries (Schaumburg et 

461 

al.,  2014).  Even  though  these  PVL  carrying  isolates  of  our  study  are  MSSA  and  might  thus  be 

462 

considered  of  a  lesser  health  risk,  all  isolates  harbour  sdrM  and  3  isolates  harbour  penicillin  and 

463 

fosfomycin resistance  genes and one strain additionally harbours a  tetracycline resistance  gene. The 

464 

combinations of PVL, MDR, enterotoxin genes, edinB, cna and sasG yields critical combinations with 

465 

elevated human health threats. 

466 

Although  this  study  provides  a  first  and  novel  insight  into  the  population  structure,  virulence 

467 

characteristics and antibiotic resistances of milk-associated S. aureus in three African countries, this 

468 

study  also  features  some  limitations.  Given  the  number  of  samples  per  location  and  the  number  of 

469 

locations,  this  study  provides  a  small  but  relevant  snapshot  of  S.  aureus  in  various  areas  of  three 

470 

different  African  countries.  While  not  providing  a  complete  and  fully  representative  epidemiologic 

471 

surveillance  picture,  such  snapshots  are  a  necessary  first  step  to  initiate  the  succession  of 

472 

epidemiologic studies of increasing complexity. The snapshot of this study provides baseline data that 

473 

can be considered for the design, sample size calculations and justification of enhanced epidemiologic 

474 

cross  sectional  studies  that  would  provide  the  necessary  input  for  intervention  studies.  The  data 

475 

provided in this study of potential mixed human and animal S. aureus strains in food will also help to 

476 

justify  a  transdisciplinary  One  Health  or  Eco  Health  approach  to  enhance  research  output  through

5  Conclusions 

480 

This  study  represents  one  of  the  first  assessments  of  population  structure,  virulence  and  antibiotic 

481 

resistance  characteristics outside healthcare  or  human-associated  settings. S.  aureus  from  traditional 

482 

raw and fermented dairy products in Kenya, Somalia and Côte d’Ivoire are highly diverse yielding 12 

483 

new ST from the 40 and 66 isolates processed by MLST and DNA microarray, respectively. MLST 

484 

and CC-assignment suggest that S. aureus in milk is originating from human and animal sources alike 

485 

highlighting the strong need for improved manufacturing processes, hygiene, producer and consumer 

486 

awareness as well as proper animal care. As previously indicated, MRSA prevalence in Africa is still 

487 

low  and  all  isolates  analysed  in  this  study  were  MSSA.  However,  high  prevalence  of  MDR  to 

488 

penicillin, tetracycline and fosfomycin was observed. In addition, we detected high viable cell counts 

489 

in food products clearly and detected a broad range of genes encoding virulence factors such as PVL, 

490 

TSST-1, and staphylococcal enterotoxins, indicating a health risk for humans and animals alike. The 

491 

expected  circulation of  isolates  within this  highly  connected  environment  only  strengthens  the clear 

492 

need for an overarching One Health approach to control and mitigate the outcome of MDR S. aureus 

493 

contamination in milk.
