INTRODUCTION

ABSTRACT

A total of 112 Staphylococcus aureus isolates obtained 
from  subclinical  bovine  mastitis  cases  were  examined 
for antibiotic susceptibility and biofilm-forming ability 
as  well  as  genes  responsible  for  antibiotic  resistance, 
biofilm-forming ability, and adhesin. Antimicrobial sus-
ceptibility of the isolates were determined by disk diffu-
sion method. Biofilm forming ability of the isolates were 
investigated by Congo red agar method, standard tube 
method, and microplate method. The genes responsible 
for  antibiotic  resistance,  biofilm-forming  ability,  and 
adhesion were examined by PCR. Five isolates (4.5%) 
were identified as methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus by 
antibiotic susceptibility testing and confirmed by mecA 
detection. The resistance rates to penicillin, ampicillin, 
tetracycline, erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethox-
azole,  enrofloxacin,  and  amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid 
were  45.5,  39.3,  33,  26.8,  5.4,  0.9,  and  0.9%,  respec-
tively. All isolates were susceptible against vancomycin 
and  gentamicin.  The  blaZ  (100%),  tetK  (67.6%),  and 
ermA (70%) genes were the most common antibiotic-
resistance  genes.  Using  Congo  red  agar,  microplate, 
and  standard  tube  methods,  70.5,  67,  and  62.5%  of 
the isolates were found to be biofilm producers, respec-
tively. The percentage rate of icaA, icaD, and bap genes 
in  Staph.  aureus  isolates  were  86.6,  86.6,  and  13.4%, 
respectively.  The  adhesion  molecules  fnbA,  can,  and 
clfA were detected in 87 (77.7%), 98 (87.5%), and 75 
(70%) isolates, respectively. The results indicated that 
Staph. aureus from sublinical bovine mastitis cases were 
mainly resistant to β-lactams and, to a lesser extent, 
to  tetracycline  and  erythromycin.  Also,  biofilm-  and 
adhesion-related genes, which are increasingly accepted 
as an important virulence factor in the pathogenesis of 
Staph. aureus infections, were detected at a high rate.

Mastitis  is  a  worldwide  problem  causing  enormous 
economic  losses  in  dairy  industry  due  to  poor  milk 
quality,  reduced  milk  yield,  increased  usage  of  drugs 
and veterinary service, as well as high culling rate of 
affected cattle and sometimes death due to the disease 
(Kumar  et  al.,  2010).  Staphylococcus  aureus  is  one  of 
the leading agents isolated from bovine mastitis cases 
and is characterized by lower cure rates compared with 
other mastitis pathogens. This phenomenon is mainly 
explained by acquisition of antimicrobial resistance and 
their  biofilm-forming  ability  (Taponen  and  Pyörälä, 
2009).

Misuse  and  widespread  use  of  antibiotics  for  the 
treatment  and  prevention  of  bovine  mastitis  leads  to 
development and emergence of resistance among masti-
tis pathogens against antibiotics (Oliver and Murinda, 
2012).  Beta-lactams  have  been  widely  used  to  treat 
mastitis cases for several decades, but their efficiency 
is reduced due to β-lactamase synthesis, which is en-
coded by blaZ (Olsen et al., 2006). Another β-lactam 
resistance  mechanism,  called  methicillin/oxacillin  re-
sistance, is mediated by low-affinity penicillin-binding 
protein  (PBP2a)  encoded  by  mecA  (Sawant  et  al., 
2009).

Another mechanism significantly affecting the effec-
tiveness of treatment of mastitis cases is the production 
of biofilm. Biofilm formation reduces susceptibility of 
Staph. aureus to various antibiotics by decreasing diffu-
sion of antibiotics inside biofilm matrix and becoming 
resistant to high concentrations of antimicrobials. Bio-
film also helps (1) bacteria adhesion and colonization of 
mammary gland tissue, (2) evasion from harsh condi-
tions within host and phagocytosis, and (3) persistence 
of  infection.  The  icaA  and  icaD  genes,  found  at  the 
ica  locus  present  in  Staph.  aureus  and  Stahpylococcus 
epidermidis, play a significant role in biofilm formation.

ASLANTAŞ AND DEMIR

Whereas  icaA  encodes  N-acetylglucosaminyltransfer-
ase, responsible for the N-acetylglucosamine oligomers 
from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (Arciola et al., 2001), 
icaD plays a critical role in the maximal expression of 
N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, leading to the pheno-
typic expression of the capsular polysaccharide (Gerke 
et al., 1998). In addition to the above mentioned genes, 
a surface protein called biofilm-associated protein (bap) 
has been reported to be involved in biofilm formation 
of bovine Staph. aureus strains. The bap gene implicates 
biofilm  formation  by  promoting  primary  attachment 
and  adhesion  to  inert  and  live  surfaces  (Cucarella  et 
al., 2004).

Staphylococcus  aureus  have  a  variety  of  adhesins 
playing an important role in the onset of infection by 
binding  host  tissues  and  accepted  as  an  important 
virulence  factors.  These  adhesins  specifically  interact 
adhesive matrix components found on host tissue and 
designated as the microbial surface component recog-
nizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMM; Patti 
et al., 1994). Of these MSCRAMM, fibronectin-binding 
protein A (fnbA), clumping factor A (clfA), and colla-
gen-binding  protein  (cna)  are  accepted  as  important 
virulence  factors  in  binding  to  host  cell,  colonization 
and invasion (Haveri et al., 2008).

The aims of the current study were (1) to investigate 
the  antibiotic  susceptibility  and  antibiotic  resistance 
genes, (2) determine the ability of biofilm synthesis and 
the genes responsible for slime synthesis of the isolates, 
and  (3)  search  for  cna,  fnbA,  and  clfA  genes  coding 
MSCRAMM in Staph. aureus strains from subclinical 
mastitis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Bacterial Isolates

A total of 112 Staph. aureus strains isolated from milk 
samples submitted to the Department of Microbiology 
laboratory  (Mustafa  Kemal  University)  from  2008  to 
2010 were studied. The strains were isolated from 330 
dairy cattle belonging to 26 family-sized farms (average 
of 15–20 cattle) located in southern Turkey. Subclini-
cal bovine mastitis cases were detected using California 
mastitis test. Milk samples were inoculated onto blood 
agar supplemented with 5% defibrinated sheep blood. 
The isolates were identified according to classical mi-
crobiological methods (Quinn et al., 1998).

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing

Antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates were de-
termined using disk diffusion method according to the 

Journal of Dairy Science Vol. 99 No. 11, 2016

guidelines  of  Clinical  Laboratory  Standards  Institute 
(2008). The antimicrobials used were penicillin (10 µg), 
ampicillin  (10  µg),  amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid  (20/10 
µg), oxacillin (1 µg), vancomycin (30 µg), gentamycin 
(10 µg), enrofloxacin (5 µg), erythromycin (15 µg), tet-
racycline  (30  µg),  and  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 
(1.25/23.75 µg). Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213) 
was used as a quality-control strain.

Biofilm Formation

Biofilm-forming ability of Staph. aureus strains were 

determined using 3 different methods.

Congo Red Agar Method

Qualitative detection of biofilm production by Staph. 
aureus strains were determined using Congo Red Agar 
(CRA) plates as previously described by Freeman et 
al. (1989). Strains producing black and rough colonies 
were considered biofilm producers.

Standard Tube Method

The qualitative assay for biofilm formation was per-
formed  according  to  the  method  described  by  Chris-
tensen et al. (1985). Presence of adherent film stained 
with  safranine  on  the  inner  surface  of  the  standard 
tubes (ST) was accepted as indication of positive re-
sult. The biofilms formed were scored as negative (−), 
weak (+), moderate (++), and strong (+++).

Microplate Method

Quantitative  biofilm  determination  was  carried  out 
using the microplate (MP) method described by Chris-
tensen  et  al.  (1985)  in  tissue  culture  plates  with  96 
flat-bottomed well. All the experiments were repeated 
at  least  twice,  and  the  values  of  optical  density  were 
then  averaged.  A  3-grade  scale  was  used  to  evaluate 
the  biofilm-forming  ability  of  strains:  optical  density 
<0.120  (–);  optical  density  =  0.120–0.240  (+);  and 
optical density >0.240 (++).

DNA Isolation and PCR Amplification of Antibiotic 
Resistance and Biofilm Genes

Bacterial DNA extraction was performed using com-
mercial  DNA  extraction  kit  (InstaGene  Matrix,  Bio-
Rad, Hercules, CA). The PCR amplification of intracel-
lular  adhesion  genes  (icaA  and  icaD),  bap  gene,  and 
adhesion molecules (cna, clfA, fnbA) were determined 
as previously described by Vasudevan et al. (2003), Cu-

crobial resistance genes related to methicillin (mecA), 
penicillin (blaZ), tetracycline (tetM, tetK, tetL, tetO), 
aminoglycoside  [aac(6′)-Ie-aph(2″)-Ia,  ant(4′)-la  and 
aph(3′)-IIIa], and macrolide (ermA, ermB, and ermC) 
were investigated as previously reported by Jensen et al. 
(1999), Vesterholm-Nielsen et al. (1999), Strommenger 
et al. (2003), and Choi et al. (2003) using PCR assay.

RESULTS

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing  
and Resistance Genes

The data on the antimicrobial susceptibility of 112 
Staph.  aureus  strains  and  resistance  genes  are  given 
in  Table  1.  Five  isolates  (4.5%)  were  found  as  meth-
icillin-resistant  Staph.  aureus  (MRSA)  by  antibiotic 
susceptibility (resistant to oxacillin) and confirmed by 
mecA detection. Various rates of resistance to penicil-
lin  (45.5%),  ampicillin  (39.3%),  tetracycline  (33%), 
erythromycin  (26.8%),  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 
(5.4%),  oxacillin  (4.5%),  enrofloxacin  (0.9%),  and 
amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid  (0.9%)  were  detected.  All 
isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and gentamicin. 
All  penicillin-resistant  isolates  contained  blaZ.  Of  37 
tetracycline-resistant isolates, 25 possessed tetK, 9 had 
tetM,  whereas  3  carried  both  tetK  and  tetM.  Among 
the erythromycin-resistant isolates (n = 30), ermA was 
detected in 21 isolates, ermC was detected in 6 isolates, 

ermA and ermC were detected in 3 isolates. None of 
the isolates carried aminoglycoside-resistance genes.

Biofilm Formation and Biofilm-Related Genes

Out of 112 Staph. aureus isolates, 79 (70.5%) isolates 
by CRA method, 75 (67%) isolates by MP method, and 
70  (62.5%)  isolates  by  the  ST  method  were  found  as 
biofilm producers (Table 2). Both icaA and icaD were 
detected in 97 (86.6%) isolates, and bap were detected 
in 15 (13.4%) isolates. Comparison of CRA, MP, and 
ST methods with PCR results is given in Table 3.

Adhesion Genes

Genes cna, fnbA, clfA were detected in 98 (87.5%), 

87 (77.7%), and 75 (70%) isolates, respectively.

DISCUSSION

Many  previous  studies  showed  that  Staph.  aureus 
was  the  most  important  microorganism  isolated  from 
subclinical  mastitis  cases  in  the  world  (Taponen  and 
Pyörälä, 2009). Similarly, previous studies carried out 
in  Turkey  also  revealed  that  Staph.  aureus  was  the 
most common agent with various isolation rates vary-
ing between 24.63 and 39.04% (Gulcu and Ertas, 2004; 
Macun et al., 2011; Yesilmen et al., 2012).

In  our  study,  Staph.  aureus  isolates  showed  higher 
rate  of  resistance  to  penicillin  (45.5%).  This  result  is 
not surprising, because β-lactams are widely prescribed 
agents to cure bovine mastitis cases in Turkey. Previous 
studies conducted in Turkey revealed that prevalence of 
penicillin resistance were 75% in Marmara region, 62% 
in Central Anatolia, and 63.3% in Burdur, respectively 
(İkiz et al., 2013; Güler et al., 2005; Turutoğlu et al., 
2006). Resistance rate to tetracycline (33%) was higher 
than  those  from  findings  of  İkiz  et  al.  (2013;  16.6%) 
and Güler et al. (2005; 27.9%), but lower than findings 
(61.2%) of Turutoğlu et al. (2006), suggesting that re-
sistance rates for Staph. aureus, such as those for other 
bacteria, vary regionally and are influenced by antibi-
otic  usage.  The  erythromycin-resistance  rate  (26.8%) 
was  inconsistent  with  previous  studies  conducted  by 
Ünal and İstanbulluoğlu (2009) in Kırıkkale and Tel et 
al.  (2012)  in  Şanlıurfa,  who  reported  resistance  rates 
of  4.3  and  9.3%,  respectively.  But,  Ikiz  et  al.  (2013) 
reported  erythromycin  resistance  rate  as  33.33%.  In 
previous studies, generally low or no resistance against 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was reported in Turkey 
(Güler  et  al.,  2005;  Ünal  and  İstanbulluoğlu,  2009; 
Tel et al., 2012). Similarly, low resistance (5.4%) was 
found against this agent in current study. In contrast 
to  these  studies,  high  levels  resistance  were  reported 
by Turutoğlu et al. (2006) and İkiz et al. (2013) (45.6 
vs. 58.83%, respectively). One of the striking results of 
the  study  was  very  low  resistance  prevalence  against 
enrofloxacin  (0.9%)  and  amoxicillin-clavulanic  acid 
(0.9%), as these drugs are critically important for the 
treatment  of  staphylococcal  infections  in  veterinary 
medicine (Beco et al., 2013).

The biofilm-forming ability of staphylococci has in-
creasingly been accepted as an important virulence trait 

in addition to exotoxins and surface proteins produced 
by  staphylococci  (Vancraeynest  et  al.,  2004).  Among 
the methods used for determining biofilm-forming abil-
ity of Staph. aureus from bovine mastitis cases, it was 
observed  that  the  highest  positivity  was  obtained  by 
the CRA method (Vasudevan et al., 2003; Turkyilmaz 
and Eskiizmirliler, 2006; Dhanawade et al., 2010). In a 
similar manner, in the current study, higher positivity 
rate was found by CRA (70.5%) than by MP (67%) or 
ST (62.5%). A discrepancy has also been reported be-
tween the results of phenotypic and genotypic methods 
used for the determination of biofilm forming ability of 
Staph. aureus isolates. Indeed, 18 icaA- and icaD-posi-
tive isolates were negative by all 3 phenotypic methods 
used in our study. Cramton et al. (1999) suggested that 
this discrepancy may arise from point mutations in the 
ica locus or other yet unknown factor that negatively 
affects biofilm synthesis. Baselga et al. (1993) indicated 
that phenotypic expression of the biofilm synthesis was 
quite sensitive to in vitro conditions. Ciftci et al. (2009) 
mentioned  possible  role  of  genes  in  the  ica  locus  in-
volved in controlling slime expression. Nourbakhsh and 
Namvar  (2016)  investigated  possible  role  of  12  genes 
involved in biofilm formation in MRSA and found that 
all strains had biofilm-producing ability with different 
degrees  due  to  the  different  prevalence  rates  of  these 
genes.  Pereyra  et  al.  (2016)  emphasized  that  over-
expression  of  icaD  and  fnbB  genes  was  necessary  to 
reach the highest invasion rates, irrespective of genes 
related  to  adherence  and  biofilm  formation.  Another 
gene  involved  in  biofilm  formation  and  persistence  of 
Staph. aureus on the mammary gland epithelium is bap 
(Cucarella et al., 2001), which was detected only in 15 
(13.4%) of the isolates in the current study. Our results 
are comparable to the study carried out by Zuniga et 
al.  (2015),  who  reported  that  15.8%  of  Staph.  aureus 
strains obtained from bovine subclinical mastitis cases 
in Brazil harbored this gene. However, Salimena et al. 
(2016) in Brazil detected bap in 95.6% of the isolates, 
which is the highest prevalence rate reported to date, 
whereas some authors did not detect this gene among 
Staph.  aureus  from  subclinical  bovine  mastitis  cases 
(Sung et al., 2008; Vautor et al., 2008; Szweda et al., 
2012; Xu et al., 2015). Khoramrooz et al. (2016) in Iran 
and Darwish and Asfour (2013) in Egypt detected this

gene  in  5  and  2.5%  of  their  isolates,  respectively.  To 
our knowledge, this is the first time bap has been shown 
among Staph. aureus isolates of bovine mastitis origin 
in Turkey.

In  the  current  study,  all  penicillin-resistant  isolates 
(45.5%) were also positive for blaZ. Similarly, da Costa 
Krewer et al. (2015) also reported higher rate (97.6%) 
of  blaZ  among  penicillin-resistant  Staph.  aureus  from 
bovine  mastitis  in  the  northeast  of  Brazil.  Another 
mechanism is methicillin resistance; MRSA has gained 
increasing  importance  in  veterinary  medicine  in  the 
last  2  decades,  as  MRSA  show  resistance  not  only 
β-lactams but also other classes of antimicrobials (Lee., 
2003;  Baptiste  et  al.,  2005).  In  the  current  study,  all 
oxacillin-resistant isolates were also positive for mecA 
(3.6%). In a previous study, Ciftci et al. (2009) detected 
presence of mecA in only 4 of 59 (6.7%) Staph. aureus 
isolates from bovine mastitis in Turkey.

Staphylococcal  adhesins  have  been  shown  to  be 
crucial  for  binding  host  surface.  Thus,  adhesins  con-
tribute to tissue adhesion and colonization in various 
infections,  which  is  considered  a  critical  stage  in  the 
initiation of infection (Klein et al., 2012; McCormack et 
al., 2014; Zuniga et al., 2015). However, little is known 
about surface adhesins of Staph. aureus strains isolated 
from bovine mastitis cases in Turkey. Our study marks 
the first time presence of some important adhesin genes 
(cna, fnbA, and clfA) were investigated in Staph. aureus 
from bovine mastitis in Turkey.

The cna gene was detected in 87.5% of the isolates 
in  the  present  study,  which  is  very  high  percentage 
compared  with  previous  studies.  Zuniga  et  al.  (2015) 
and  Ikawaty  et  al.  (2010)  reported  this  gene  in  47.4 
and 49% of their isolates, respectively. A lower percent-
age  of  the  cna  gene  was  also  identified  in  10.7,  22.4, 
22.5,  and  31.9%  of  Staph.  aureus isolates  subclinical 
bovine mastitis by Xu et al. (2015), Klein et al. (2012), 
Khoramrooz  et  al.  (2016),  and  Ote  et  al.  (2011),  re-
spectively.

The  gene  encoding  the  fibronectin-binding  protein 
A (fnbA) was detected in 77.7% of Staph. aureus iso-
lates, which is nearly similar to findings of Khoramrooz 
et al. (2016), Xu et al. (2015), Ote et al. (2011), and 
Zuniga et al. (2015), who detected this gene in 72.5, 70, 
83.8, and 84.2% of the isolates, respectively. However, 
Ikawaty et al. (2010) and Kumar et al. (2011) reported 
higher prevalence rates of 96 and 100% of the Staph. 
aureus  isolates,  respectively.  Also,  a  lower  prevalence 
rate (50.6%) was also reported by Klein et al. (2012).

Another important adhesin belong to MSCRAMM is 
clfA. This adhesin promotes virulence in invasive infec-
tions using different mechanisms, such as coating the 
bacterium with plasma fibrinogen and splitting of the 

complement opsonin C3b (McCormack et al., 2014). In 
our study, clfA was detected in 70% of Staph. aureus 
isolates, which is high compared with previous studies 
carried out by Klein et al. (2012; 50.6%) and Ikawaty 
et al. (2010; 21%). In contrast, Xu et al. (2015), Ote 
et al. (2011), and Pereyra et al. (2016) reported higher 
prevalence rate in their studies (89.3, 96.9, and 100%, 
respectively).

In conclusion, our study showed that Staph. aureus 
isolates  of  bovine  subclinical  mastitis  carried  widely 
both biofilm and adhesin genes involved in the patho-
genesis  of  Staph.  aureus  infections,  which  indicate 
potential virulence of the isolates. In addition, high re-
sistance was observed against β-lactams as well as mod-
erate resistance against tetracycline and erythromycin, 
which are widely used in veterinary practice. Therefore, 
to achieve effective treatment of bovine mastitis cases 
and  to  prevent  emergence  of  antibiotic-resistant  bac-
teria, particular attention should be given to isolation 
of causative agent and determination of antimicrobial 
susceptibility.
