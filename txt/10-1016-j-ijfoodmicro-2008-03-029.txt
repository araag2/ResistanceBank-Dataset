This study was conducted to examine a current baseline proﬁle of antimicrobial resistance and virulence of
Escherichia coli isolated from foods commonly sold in the market place in Vietnam. E. coli were isolated from
180 samples of raw meat, poultry and shellﬁsh and also isolated from 43 chicken faeces samples. Ninety-nine
E. coli isolates recovered from all sources were selected for the investigation of their susceptibility to 15
antimicrobial agents by the disk diffusion method. Eighty-four percent of the isolates were resistant to one or
more antibiotics, and multi-resistance, deﬁned as resistance to at least 3 different classes of antibiotics, was
detected in all sources. The rates of multi-resistance were up to 89.5% in chicken, 95% in chicken faeces and
75% in pork isolates. Resistance was most frequently observed to tetracycline (77.8%), sulfafurazole (60.6%),
ampicillin (50.5%), amoxicillin (50.5%), trimethoprim (51.5%), chloramphenicol (43.4%), streptomycin (39.4%),
nalidixic acid (34.3%) and gentamicin (24.2%).
In addition, the isolates also displayed resistance to
ﬂuoroquinolones (ciproﬂoxacin 16.2%, norﬂoxacin 17.2%, and enroﬂoxacin 21.2%), with chicken isolates
showing the highest rates of resistance to these antibiotics (52.6–63.2%). Thirty-eight multi-resistant isolates
were selected for further the examination of antibiotic resistance genes and were also evaluated for virulence
gene proﬁles by multiplex and uniplex polymerase chain reaction. The beta-lactam TEM gene and
tetracycline resistance tetA, tetB genes were frequently detected in the tested isolates (84.2% and 89.5%
respectively). Genes which are responsible for resistance to streptomycin (aadA) (68.4%), chloramphenicol
(cmlA) (42.1%), sulfonamides (sulI) (39.5%), trimethoprim (dhfrV) (26.3%) and kanamycin (aphA-1) (23.7%)
were also widely distributed. Plasmid-mediated ampC genes were detected in E. coli isolates from chicken
and pork. The isolates were tested for the presence of 58 virulence genes for adhesins, toxins, capsule
synthesis, siderophores, invasins and others from different E. coli pathotypes. All of the tested isolates
contained at least one virulence gene and there were 16 genes detected. Virulence genes detected were ﬁmH
(92.1%), bmaE (84.2%), TSPE4.C2 (42.1%), aidA AIDA-I (orfB) (31.6%), east1 (26.3%), traT (23.7%), and others
including fyuA, iutA, chuA, yjaA, iss, iroNE. coli, ibeA, aah (orfA), iha and papG allele III (10.5–2.6%). Typical
toxin genes produced by enterohemorrhagic and enterotoxigenic E. coli pathotypes (a heat-stable toxin (ST),
heat-labile toxin (LT) and Shiga toxin stx1, stx2) were not detected in any of these 38 isolates. The study has
revealed that E. coli in raw foods is a signiﬁcant reservoir of resistance and virulence genes.

1. Introduction

Foodborne diseases due primarily to bacteria, viruses, parasites,
and chemicals are an important cause of morbidity and mortality
worldwide. Bacteria are probably the most common cause of illness
(Mead et al., 1999; Lindqvist et al., 2000; Adak et al., 2002; Su et al.,
2005; Lynch et al., 2006). Foodborne bacteria infections with
diarrhoea symptoms are usually self limiting. However, systemic

infection and ensuing death can occur, particularly in vulnerable
groups with diminished immunity such as the elderly, infants and
young children (Mead et al., 1999; Meng and Doyle, 2002; Kennedy et
al., 2004). Treatment options for foodborne gastroenteritis may
require ﬂuid and electrolyte replacement and antibiotics are usually
prescribed in severe cases (Nataro and Kaper, 1998; Hohmann, 2001;
Huang et al., 2006).

Foods contaminated with antibiotic resistant bacteria could be a
major threat to public health as there is the distinct possibility that
genes encoding antibiotic resistance determinants that are carried on
mobile genetic elements may be transferred to other bacteria of
human clinical signiﬁcance. E. coli is a candidate vehicle for such
transfers because of its diversity and also because it survives as

218

common ﬂora in the gastrointestinal tracts of both humans and
animals. They are sensitive to selection pressure exerted by antibiotic
usage and carry genetic mobile elements to achieve such transmission
(Van den Bogaard and Stobberingh, 2000). Although the carriage of
antibiotic resistance genes is not conﬁned to commensal E. coli in the
face of antibiotic selection, the capacity to threaten human consumers
is signiﬁcantly enhanced if foodborne strains carried virulence genes
that qualiﬁed them as potential human pathogens (Orskov and
Orskov, 1992; Schroeder et al., 2004).

Diarrhoeagenic E. coli strains are categorised into speciﬁc groups
based on virulence properties, mechanisms of pathogenicity, clinical
syndromes, and distinct O:H serotypes (Meng et al., 2001). The six
main categories include enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enterotoxi-
genic E. coli (ETEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), enteroaggregative E.
coli (EAEC), enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC or STEC), diffuse-
adhering E. coli (DAEC) (Nataro and Kaper, 1998). There are regional
differences in the prevalence of the different diarrhoeagenic E. coli
categories (Albert et al., 1995; Ratchtrachenchai et al., 2004; Nguyen
et al., 2006). Amongst all of these different pathotypes, faecal STEC
contamination of raw meats and poultry represent the most
commonly reported food safety problems (Guth et al., 2003; Conedera
et al., 2004; Carney et al., 2006; Samadpour et al., 2006). In contrast to
diarrhoeagenic E. coli, extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC)
strains are incapable of causing enteric disease but responsible for
most extra-intestinal infections (Kuhnert et al., 2000; Russo and
Johnson, 2000; Johnson and Russo, 2002; Bekal et al., 2003).

Like in many other developing countries, raw food hygiene and
antimicrobial resistance epidemiology is at its infancy in Vietnam. In
addition, the lack of stringent controls on antimicrobial usage in
human health and particularly in animal production systems increases
the risk of foodborne microbes harbouring an array of resistance
genes. This study was conducted to address some of these issues and
to provide a current baseline proﬁle of antimicrobial resistance and
virulence of E. coli isolated from foods commonly sold in the market
place in Vietnam. The strategy was to compare E. coli susceptibility to
15 antibiotics and the prevalence of corresponding genes encoding
these resistances. The pathogenic potential of E. coli isolates based on
their virulence gene proﬁles was also determined.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. E. coli isolation and identiﬁcation

One hundred and eighty samples of meat comprising beef (n =50),
chicken/poultry (n =30), pork (n =50) and shellﬁsh (n=50) were
purchased from various markets and supermarkets around Ho Chi
Minh City between February and June 2004 for the isolation and
identiﬁcation of E. coli. Forty-three samples from chicken faeces were
also collected from two chicken farms, chickens less than 1 month old.
The procedures for isolation of E. coli were based on the Nordic
Committee on Food Analysis method (NMKL, 1996).

2.2. Antibiotic susceptibility tests

Ninety-nine E. coli isolates from different sources (pork (n=20), beef
(n=20), chicken (n=19), chicken faeces (n=20), shellﬁsh (n=20)) were
randomly selected from the E. coli collection for antibiotic susceptibility
test to 15 antibiotics by the disk diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton
agar plates, only one E. coli isolate was selected from one food sample.
The standard procedure of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI, formerly NCCLS) (NCCLS, 2004) were strictly followed
throughout the testing procedure. Quality control strains E. coli ATCC
25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 were included in each run.
The concentration of the discs (Oxoid, Australia) and abbreviation of
antimicrobial agents which were used throughout this paper are:
ampicillin (AMP) 10 µg, amoxicillin (AMX) 10 µg, amoxicillin/clavulanic

acid (AMC) 30 µg, cephalothin (CEF) 30 µg, chloramphenicol (CHL) 30 µg,
ciproﬂoxacin (CIP) 5 µg, enroﬂoxacin (ENR) 5 µg, tetracycline (TET)
30 µg, gentamicin (GEN) 10 µg, kanamycin (KAN) 30 µg, nalidixic acid
(NAL) 30 µg, norﬂoxacin (NOR) 10 µg, sulphafurazole (SUL) 300 µg,
streptomycin (STR) 10 µg, and trimethoprim (TMP) 5 µg. The isolates
were classiﬁed as susceptible, intermediate, and resistant according to
the zone diameter interpretative standards recommendations by CLSI
(2005) and recorded as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to each
antibiotic tested.

2.3. Detection of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes

Thirty-eight multi-resistant isolates, which showed the highest
degree of resistance among the collection, were examined for
antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. These included E. coli
isolates from chicken (n=14), beef (n=4), pork (n =8), shellﬁsh (n =5),
and chicken faeces (n=7). Nineteen of the isolates contained known
class 1 resistance integrons (Van et al., 2007).

Twenty-two antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were screened by
PCR using a combination of 3 multiplex and 3 uniplex assays. Sets 1 to
3 were designed to detect sulI, SHV, cat1, dhfrV, ﬂoR, aadA, OXA; TEM,
cmlA, CITM, ereA, dhfrI, aac(3)-I); and aphA-1, MOXM, DHAM, EBCM,
aac(3)-IV, FOXM genes respectively. The tetracycline resistance
genes (tetA, tetB and tetC) were ampliﬁed individually (Table 1). A
positive and a negative control for each PCR were included. The
identity of all 22 ARG amplicons have been previously conﬁrmed by
sequencing (Wu, 2006). PCR reactions for multiplex sets 1–3 were
performed in a total volume of 25 μl containing 2 μl of Chelex (BioRad)
extracted DNA with ﬁnal concentrations of 4 mM MgCl2, 10 μM of each
dNTP (Bioline), 5 μl of each primer pool and 1 U of Hotstart Taq
(Qiagen). The uniplex (primer sets 4–6) PCR conditions were
performed in a total volume of 50 μl containing 2 μl of Chelex
(BioRad) extracted DNA with ﬁnal concentration of 1.5 mM MgCl2,
2.5 μM of each dNTP (Bioline), 0.5 μl of each primer pair and 1 U of Taq
polymerase (Bioline). PCR ampliﬁcation was conducted in Palmcyclers
(Corbett Research) with the following conditions for multiplex sets
1–3: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 30 cycles of
denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 58 °C for 30 s, and
extension at 72 °C for 1 min and ﬁnal cycle of ampliﬁcation at 72 °C
for 10 min. The uniplex PCR ampliﬁcation conditions consisted of
initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, with 30 cycles of denaturation
at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 50 °C for 30 s, extension at 72 °C for
1 min and ﬁnal cycle of ampliﬁcation at 72 °C for 10 min. Amplicons
were visualized by electrophoresis at 80 V, 500 mA for 2.5 h for
multiplex PCRs and for 1.5 h for uniplex PCRs in 2% agarose gels
prepared in 0.5×Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer.

The presence of E. coli virulence genes were examined by PCR
using primers and PCR conditions as documented by Chapman et al.
(2006). Twelve sets of multiplex PCRs and six individual PCRs were
used to detect the presence of 58 virulence genes from E. coli
pathotypes known to cause intestinal and extra-intestinal disease in
humans and animals (Table 2).

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Antibiotic resistance phenotypes of E. coli isolates

The results demonstrate the high individual and multiple
resistance to antibiotics in E. coli and the 99 isolates showed resistance
to all 15 antibiotics tested (Table 3). Overall, resistance was most
frequently observed to tetracycline (77.8%), sulphafurazole (60.6%),
ampicillin/amoxicillin (50.5%), trimethoprim (51.5%), chloramphenicol
(43.4%), streptomycin (39.4%), nalidixic acid (34.3%) and gentamicin
(24.2%). E. coli isolates also displayed resistance to ﬂuoroquinolones
(ciproﬂoxacin 16.2%, norﬂoxacin 17.2%, and enroﬂoxacin 21.2%), in
which chicken isolates showed the highest rates of resistance to these

antibiotics (52.6–63.2%).
In contrast to this study, resistance to
ciproﬂoxacin in E. coli isolates from animal sources was reported as
either low (Teshager et al., 2000) or non-existent (Meng et al., 1998;
Klein and Bulte, 2003; Schroeder et al., 2003) in developed countries,
perhaps due to restricted uses of ﬂuoroquinolones in animal
husbandry in these countries.
In a country such as Canada,
ﬂuoroquinolones are not registered for use in pigs, therefore E. coli
isolated from this source showed very little resistance to these
antibiotics (Boerlin et al., 2005). Fluoroquinolones are critically
important for treating serious infections in humans, and the likelihood
that resistance to ﬂuoroquinolones in E. coli was induced by the use of
these antibiotics in food animals is a concern.

The E. coli isolates from chicken and pork showed a greater degree
of resistance than those from beef, reﬂecting the higher use of
antibiotics in intensive poultry and pig farming. In addition, E. coli
isolates from chicken faeces had a similar antibiotic resistance
distribution to chicken strains, except ﬂuoroquinolone and amox-
icillin/clavulanic acid, where resistance in chicken isolates was much
higher. In this study, chicken faeces were collected from very young
chickens (less than 1 month) whereas chicken meat from the market
was originated from much older birds. The difference in ages of the
chickens in our study could explain the different resistance levels as
older chicken have longer exposure periods to in-feed antibiotics and

therefore a greater possibility of their microbial ﬂora developing
resistance. Though resistance rates of E. coli from shellﬁsh were less
than that of meat and poultry, shellﬁsh isolates displayed resistance to
all 15 antibiotics tested. The resistance of E. coli isolates in shellﬁsh to
different antibiotic classes suggests that these E. coli strains were
generated from different sources in the contaminated water environ-
ment where shellﬁsh inhabit.

There were 83.8% of isolates that were resistant to one or more
antibiotics, and multi-resistance was observed in all sources (61.6%)
with rates up to 75% in pork, 89.5% in chicken, and 95% in chicken
faeces (Table 3). Resistance to more than 10 antibiotics was also
detected in chicken, pork and shellﬁsh isolates, and there were 9.1%
isolates which displayed resistance to 12–14 antibiotics. The ﬁnding of
high levels of antibiotic resistance in E. coli isolates implies that E. coli
from Vietnamese raw food may play an important role as reservoirs
for the resistance genes and be a key source for transfer of resistance
to other important human pathogens.

3.2. Antibiotic resistance genes in E. coli isolates

Genes responsible for a variety of antibiotic resistance character-
istics have been investigated by multiplex and uniplex PCRs from 38 E.
coli isolates. The results showed good correlation between antibiotic

resistance phenotype and genotypes in these E. coli isolates (Table 4).
More than one gene encoding the same resistance was detected in one
strain: two isolates from chicken contained tetracycline resistance
genes tetA+ tetC and tetB+ tetC, one isolate from chicken and another
isolate from chicken faeces contained chloramphenicol resistance
genes cat1 and cmlA. There were 84.2% of the tested isolates which
contained the beta-lactamase blaTEM gene. Our ﬁndings are similar to
studies in other countries showing that E. coli strains from food of
animal origin had a unique beta-lactamase blaTEM gene (Brinas et al.,
2002; Guerra et al., 2003). In contrast, other beta-lactamase genes
such as SHV-type and OXA-type were not detected in any isolates in
this study.

Plasmid-mediated ampC beta-lactamase genes were observed in
some E. coli isolates as a positive PCR result was detected with
MOXM family-speciﬁc primers in chicken and pork isolates,
suggesting the presence of MOX-1, MOX-2, CMY-1, or CMY-8 to
CMY-11 genes in these isolates (Perez-Perez and Hanson, 2002). In
addition, an expected band has been observed in a beef isolate with
DHAM family-speciﬁc primers,
indicating the isolate contained
DHA-1 or DHA-2 genes (Perez-Perez and Hanson, 2002). Therapeutic
options may be limited for infections caused by Gram-negative
bacteria overexpressing plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases
because such overexpression can lead to resistance to most beta-
lactam antibiotics except for cefepime, cefpirome and carbapenems
(Perez-Perez and Hanson, 2002). In addition, plasmids encoding
AmpC enzymes often carry multiple resistances and there is
evidence of spread of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases
genes between organisms (Bauernfeind et al., 1997; Winokur et al.,
2001; Philippon et al., 2002; Yan et al., 2004). Further studies of the
distribution of ampC genes are therefore necessary.

The rapid spread of tetracycline resistant determinants within a
bacterial population is due to the location of tetracycline genes on
mobile elements (Chopra and Roberts, 2001; Roberts, 2003; Sunde
and Nordstrom, 2006). In this study, it was found that tetracycline
resistance genes did spread in E. coli populations. The tetA gene was
the most prevalent of the tetracycline resistance genes detected (71.1%
of the isolates), followed by tetB (18.4%). These two genes were
reported to be predominant in E. coli isolates from livestock and food
animals in other countries (Guerra et al., 2003; Lanz et al., 2003;
Sengelov et al., 2003; Bryan et al., 2004; Saenz et al., 2004; Boerlin et
al., 2005). Genes which are responsible for resistance to streptomycin
(aadA), chloramphenicol (cmlA), sulfonamides (sulI), trimethoprim
(dhfrV) and kanamycin (aphA-1) were also widely distributed with the

rates of 68.4%, 42.1%, 39.5%, 26.3% and 23.7% respectively. Other
resistance genes including cat1 (chloramphenicol resistance), dhfrI
(trimethoprim resistance) and aac(3)-IV (gentamicin resistance) were
also detected (18.4–10.5%) in this E. coli collection. High level of E. coli
resistance in food sources should be a cause for concern as this
organism has high propensity to disseminate antimicrobial resistance
genes (WHO, 1997).

3.3. Virulence genes in E. coli isolates

iroNE. coli,

PCR ampliﬁcation has been a sensitive and valuable method for
detection of virulence genes in E. coli strains (Nataro and Kaper, 1998;
Osek et al., 1999; Paton and Paton, 2002; Chen et al., 2004). In this
study, 38 E. coli isolates were examined for the presence of virulence
genes using the method of Chapman et al. (2006). All tested isolates
were positive for at least one virulence gene with 16 out of 58 speciﬁc
genes detected (Table 4). The wide range of ExPEC-associated
virulence markers of different virulent functions, including bmaE,
ﬁmH, fyuA,
iss, traT, and papG III has been
detected, in which ﬁmH and bmaE genes were dominant and were
detected in 92.1% and 84.2% of isolates from all sources respectively.
The high prevalence of the ﬁmH gene obtained in this study was
consistent with previous reports (Johnson and Stell, 2000; Bekal et al.,
2003) that this gene was present in all E. coli isolates of different
pathotypes and also in non-pathogenic E. coli. In adapting to a pa-
thogenic environment, the genetic variation in the ﬁmH gene can
change the tropism of E. coli, shifting it toward a virulent phenotype
(Sokurenko et al., 1998). The virulence genes TSPE4.C2, aidA AIDA-I
(orfB), east1, traT, were also present at a moderate to high rate (42.1%,

31.6%, 26.3%, and 23.7% respectively). Notably, the east1 gene which is
involved in human outbreaks of diarrhoea (Vila et al., 1998; Zhou et al.,
2002) was found with high frequency in all food sources (20–50%).
The other virulence genes detected in this study include fyuA, iutA,
chuA, yjaA, iss, iroNE. coli, ibeA, aah (orfA), iha, and papG allele III
(10.5–2.6%). As strains of the same pathotype normally carry the
same virulence determinants involved in infection (Bekal et al.,
2003), the detection of 58 virulence genes associated with
representative pathotypes of E. coli in this study allow detection of
the presence of certain pathotypes in these 38 E. coli isolates. In this
case, the stx1 and stx2 virulence genes associated with the STEC
pathotype were not detected, and heat-stable toxin (ST) and heat-
labile toxin (LT) genes speciﬁc to ETEC were not observed. These
results imply that none of these 38 isolates belongs to STEC or ETEC
pathotypes. In contrast, the STEC pathotype has been found in raw
food, especially beef in other countries and mostly in industrialised
countries (Parma et al., 2000; Kumar et al., 2001; Guth et al., 2003;
Blanco et al., 2004; Conedera et al., 2004; Barlow et al., 2006; Carney
et al., 2006; Samadpour et al., 2006). There were multi-resistant
isolates which contained from 6 to 9 virulence genes. E. coli strains in
this study may not possess pathogenic functionality due to lack of
appropriate virulence gene combinations (Chapman et al., 2006).
However, bacterial virulence can be increased and new pathotypes
with new combinations of virulence factors may occur as virulence
genes can be transferred between organism populations over time,
especially since the genome of E. coli is of highly plasticity (Kuhnert
et al., 2000), and the problem would be considerable if this virulence
acquisition occurred in multi-resistant strains.

Interestingly,

The average number of antibiotic resistance genes and virulence
genes from different origins were calculated. The average number of
antibiotic resistance genes in different sources were: chicken (5.3),
chicken faeces (5.0), pork (4.5), shellﬁsh (3.4), and beef (2.5), whereas
the average number of virulence genes were: chicken (4.4), pork (3.8),
shellﬁsh (3.6), beef (2.3) and chicken faeces (2.1). Comparing to beef
isolates, chicken and pork isolates harboured more antibiotic
resistance genes and virulence genes. Chicken faeces also contained
high number of antibiotic resistance genes.
it was
observed that compared to other sources, E. coli in chickens showed a
higher frequency of resistance phenotype, they also exceed other
sources in terms of degree of antibiotic resistance genes and virulence
genes. In addition, among 38 isolates which were investigated for the
presence of antibiotic resistance genes and virulence genes, isolates
which contained the maximum number of antibiotic resistance genes
(isolate E/C/17a) and virulence genes (isolate E/C/5a) also belonged to
chicken isolates (Table 4). Using all the results together, it could be
concluded that chicken meat is the most risk-associated food source in
terms of antibiotic resistance and virulence potential. The spread of
antimicrobial agents given to poultry might be the reason for high
rates of resistance and overcrowded population in poultry husbandry
may contribute to the spread of antibiotic and virulence genes
between populations.

This study has focused primarily on the characterization of
antibiotic resistance genes found in E. coli isolated from raw foods in
Vietnam. A parallel study on virulence genes in these isolates has
conﬁrmed an absence of combinations of virulence factors that signal
the covert presence of zoonotic strains of E. coli such as O157 and
other STECs amongst the isolates. However, the strains were not
analysed for carriage of signature virulence genes found in avian
pathogenic E. coli (APECs). The importance of this study is the ﬁnding
that enteric bacteria in Vietnamese food samples are signiﬁcant
reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes.
In the light of recent
epidemiological ﬁndings that urinary tract infections in humans
may be associated with poultry consumption (Manges et al., 2007), it
endorses the need for more rigorous surveillance and improved
farming practises that can reduce the carriage of ARGs and thereby
minimize the likelihood of horizontal gene transfers of these

antimicrobial resistance genes to other microbes in the food chain.
Training for food handlers on safe food handling and proper cooking
are therefore important to reduce or eliminate the risk from antibiotic
resistance and pathogenic bacteria originating from raw foods.
Additionally, it is recommended that antibiotic usage in animal feed
must be strongly regulated. There is still a big gap in understanding
the genetic background of antibiotic resistance and virulence of
enteric bacteria from food. Studies with comprehensive collections of
samples are urgently needed to establish better measures for
preventing foodborne disease.
