The present study was aimed to determine the prevalence and characteristics of
Salmonella isolated from meat samples of commercial broilers (CB) and spent hens
(SH). Between March and June 2016, 200 retail raw chicken carcasses (100 from CB
and 100 from SH) were obtained from local supermarkets in Tai’an city of China, and
Salmonella isolates were then analyzed for antibiotic resistance, serotype, β-lactamase
genes, and the presence of class 1 integron. Forty Salmonella strains were obtained
in this study (CB: 21/100, 21%; SH: 19/100, 19%). Three serotypes were identiﬁed
in 40 Salmonella, and S. Enteritidis (CB: 15/21, 71.4%; SH: 10/19, 52.6%) was the
dominant serotype, followed by S. Typhimurium (CB: 4/21, 19%; SH: 6/19, 31.6%)
and S. Derby (CB: 2/21, 9.5%; SH: 3/19, 15.8%). Among 21 Salmonella isolated from
CB, high antibiotic resistance rates were found for ampicillin (20/21, 95.2%), nalidixic
acid (18/21, 85.7%), cefotaxime (17/21, 81%), and tetracycline (13/21, 61.9%); class 1
integron was observed in seven isolates (7/21, 33.3%), and gene cassettes included an
empty integron (0.15 kb, n = 1), aadA2 (1.2 kb, n = 3), drfA1-aadA1 (1.4 kb, n = 1),
and drfA17-aadA5 (1.7 kb, n = 2); blaTEM−1 was the dominant β-lactamase gene (21/21,
100%), followed by blaCTX−M−55 (7/21, 33.3%). Among 19 Salmonella isolated from SH,
high antibiotic resistance rates were found for nalidixic acid (19/19, 100%), tetracycline
(19/19, 100%), ampicillin (18/19, 94.7%), and ciproﬂoxacin (13/19, 68.4%); class 1
integron was observed in two isolates (2/19, 10.5%), and gene cassettes included
drfA17-aadA5 (1.7 kb, n = 1) and drfA1-aadA1 (1.4 kb, n = 1); blaTEM−1 was the
dominant β-lactamase gene (19/19, 100%), followed by blaCTX−M−55 (2/19, 10.5%)
and blaCMY−2 (1/19, 5.3%). Collectively, antibiotic-resistant Salmonella can be widely
detected in retail raw chicken carcasses of CB and SH, and therefore can pose a serious
risk to public health.

Keywords: antibiotic resistance, β-lactamase gene, class 1 integron, Salmonella, serotype

INTRODUCTION

Salmonella is a notorious human pathogen and can lead to acute intestinal disease outbreaks in
humans through consumption of contaminated foods (Pegues et al., 2006). It has been widely
recognized that poultry products, such as eggs and meats, are a crucial transmission vehicle for
Salmonella (Kusunoki et al., 2000; Betancor et al., 2010; Painter et al., 2013; Antunes et al., 2016).

Salmonella from Raw Chicken Carcasses

At present and even for a long time in the future, antibiotic-
based treatment for human salmonellosis infection is the most
eﬀective method in clinical practice (Ribeiro et al., 2011; Crump
et al., 2015). It is therefore pivotal to use antibiotics to prevent
and control Salmonella infections.

However, the widespread use and even abuse of antibiotics
in animal husbandry have facilitated the emergence and
dissemination of antibiotic resistance in Salmonella, which
has posed a serious challenge for the health of animals and
humans (Marshall and Levy, 2011; Mukerji et al., 2017).
Noticeably, numerous studies in recent years have indicated that
extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Salmonella
has been frequently isolated from food-producing animals
and animal-derived foods in many countries of the world,
including China (Wu et al., 2013; Chon et al., 2015; Franco
et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2015; Noda et al., 2015; Ziech et al.,
2016; Zhao et al., 2017). ESBL-producing Salmonella is able
to inactivate and hydrolyze the β-lactam ring in β-lactam
antibiotics and third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins,
leading to the increase of
treatment cost and even to
therapy failure, which has triggered a serious public concern
(Bonnet, 2004; Pitout and Laupland, 2008). In addition, the
class 1 integrons are frequently observed among antibiotic-
resistant Salmonella, which contributes
to the spread of
antibiotic resistance genes among bacteria (Wannaprasat et al.,
2011).

Therefore, understanding the prevalence and characteristics
food animal
importance for developing eﬀective treatment

of Salmonella isolated from meat samples of
origins is of

strategies to control and prevent Salmonella infections in humans
and animals. However, information about the occurrence and
characteristics of Salmonella in chicken meats in China is poorly
documented. In China, two main chicken breeds,
including
introduced commercial broilers (CB) and spent hens (SH), are
widely reared and are important sources of chicken meat (Chen
et al., 2016). This study was therefore undertaken to determine
the prevalence and characteristics of Salmonella recovered from
retail chicken carcasses of CB and SH in Tai’an region, China.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample Collection
Between March and June 2016, 200 retail raw chicken carcasses
without giblets
(100 from CB and 100 from SH) were
obtained from local supermarkets in Tai’an city, China. These
supermarkets had areas of 5,000–10,000 m2, oﬀering various
foods and household products, in which raw chicken carcasses
were sold refrigerated in a meat department. After purchase, the
samples were stored in an icebox and immediately transported
into our microbiology laboratory for further processing within
24 h.

Salmonella Isolation and Serotype
Identiﬁcation
Salmonella isolation was conducted as previously described
(Choi et al., 2015). Brieﬂy, each chicken carcass was mixed
with 400 ml of buﬀered peptone water (BPW; Hopebiol,

to determine antibiotic susceptibilities of Salmonella strains.
Antibiotics used in this study were amoxicillin/clavulanic acid
(20/10 µg), ampicillin (10µg), cefotaxime (30 µg), ciproﬂoxacin
(5 µg), ﬂorfenicol (30 µg), gentamicin (10 µg), nalidixic
acid (10 µg), spectinomycin (10 µg),
tetracycline (30 µg)
and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (1.25/23.75 µg) (Hopebiol,
Qingdao, China). Salmonella strains resistant to no less than three
classes of antibiotics were deﬁned as multidrug-resistant (MDR)
isolates. Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was used in this study as
quality control strain.

Detection of β-Lactamase Gene
According to the method previously described (Batchelor
et al., 2005; Rayamajhi et al., 2008; Li et al., 2013), polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) was used to determine the presence
of β-lactamase genes (blaTEM, blaPSE−1, blaCMY−2, blaSHV,
blaDHA−1, blaOXA, and blaCTX−M). For
isolates carrying
blaCTX−M genes, blaCTX−M gene group was further identiﬁed by
using PCR (Kim et al., 2015). The PCR products were sequenced
(Sunny, Shanghai, China), and the sequences were analyzed and
aligned using the NCBI BLAST program1.

Detection of Class I Integrons
Based on the primers previously described, PCR was used to
analyze the presence of class 1 integron (Guerra et al., 2001;
Kerrn et al., 2002). Additionally, PCR was employed to amplify
gene cassettes within the variable region of class 1 integron
according to the methods described previously (Sandvang et al.,
1998). The ampliﬁcation fragments were cloned into the pMD18-
T vector (Takara, Dalian, China), which were sequenced (Sunny,
Shanghai, China).

Statistical Analyses
Fisher’s exact
test was used to compare the prevalence of
Salmonella and proportions of class 1 integron in Salmonella
in CB and SH using SPSS 16.0 software (IBM, United States).
P-values of less than 0.05 were deﬁned as diﬀerence signiﬁcance.

RESULTS

Salmonella Prevalence
A total of 40 Salmonella strains (40/200, 20%) were isolated from
the foods, and the prevalence in CB was 21% (21/100) and 19%
(19/100) in SH. No signiﬁcant diﬀerence was found in Salmonella
prevalence between CB and SH samples (P > 0.05).

Serotyping and Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Testing
Three serotypes were identiﬁed in 40 Salmonella strains. S.
Enteritidis (CB: 15/21, 71.4%; SH: 10/19, 52.6%) was the
dominant serotype, followed by S. Typhimurium (CB: 4/21, 19%;
SH: 6/19, 31.6%) and S. Derby (CB: 2/21, 9.5%; SH: 3/19, 15.8%)
(Tables 1, 2).

for 1 min by gentle shaking. Twenty-ﬁve milliliter of
the
rinsate was mixed with 25 mL of 2 × BPW and the mixture
was incubated overnight at 37◦C. A 100 µL aliquot was
removed form the BPW enrichment broth and inoculated
into Rappaport-Vassiliadis soy peptone broth (10 mL) (RVS;
Hopebiol, Qingdao, China), which was incubated for 24 h at
42◦C. One loopful of the RVS culture was streaked onto a
xylose lysine desoxycholate agar plate (XLD; Hopebiol, Qingdao,
China), which was incubated overnight at 37◦C. The suspected
Salmonella colony (red colonies with black centers) on the
XLD plates from each chicken meat sample was identiﬁed by
biochemical conﬁrmation using biochemical tubes (Hopebiol,
Qingdao, China), and the results were interpreted according
to Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology (Garrity et al.,
2004).

According to the Kauﬀmann-White scheme, slide aggluti-
nation tests were used to serotype Salmonella isolates in this study

Salmonella from Raw Chicken Carcasses

Prevalence of Class 1 Integron and
β-Lactamase Genes
Among 21 Salmonella isolated from CB, class 1 integron was
observed in seven isolates (7/21, 33.3%), and gene cassettes
included an empty integron (0.15 kb, n = 1), aadA2 (1.2 kb,
n = 3), drfA1-aadA1 (1.4 kb, n = 1), and drfA17-aadA5 (1.7 kb,
n = 2); blaTEM−1 was the dominant β-lactamase gene (21/21,
100%), followed by blaCTX−M−55 (7/21, 33.3%) (Table 1). Among
19 Salmonella isolated from SH, class 1 integron was observed in
two isolates (2/19, 10.5%), and gene cassettes included drfA17-
aadA5 (1.7 kb, n = 1) and drfA1-aadA1 (1.4 kb, n = 1); blaTEM−1
was the dominant β-lactamase gene (19/19, 100%), followed by
blaCTX−M−55 (2/19, 10.5%) and blaCMY−2 (1/19, 5.3%) (Table 2).
Of note, the proportion of class 1 integron targets detected in
Salmonella strains from CB samples was higher than that found
in SH samples (33.3% vs. 10.5%, P < 0.05).

DISCUSSION

In the present study, 20% of 200 retail chicken carcasses were
Salmonella positive. The prevalence of Salmonella in poultry meat
products in other parts of China has been reported by others
to be approximately 36.1% (Cui H.X. et al., 2009) and 28.3%
(Li et al., 2013). The prevalence in other regions of the world
was 15.6% in chicken carcasses in EU (European Food Safety
Authority [EFSA], 2010) and 45.8% in retail chicken meat in
Korea (Park et al., 2017). These investigations indicated that
Salmonella contamination is widely distributed in poultry meats.
Of note, it is diﬃcult to compare the prevalence of Salmonella
among diﬀerent studies, because the diﬀerence may be associated
with geographical diﬀerences, sampling seasons, sample types,
methodology of isolation and culture, and environments of
slaughterhouses and marketing areas (Yan et al., 2010; Yang et al.,
2010).

Salmonella Enteritidis was the most commonly isolated
serotype in this study, and has been widely isolated in chickens,
eggs, and chicken meats in China (Yang et al., 2010; Lu et al.,
2011; Long et al., 2016). In addition, S. Enteritidis is the leading
cause of Salmonella related food-borne outbreaks in humans
worldwide (Galanis et al., 2006). Of note, S. Typhimurium is the
main serotype isolated from humans in China (Deng et al., 2012)
and S. Derby is the most common serotype isolated from infants
and toddlers in China (Cui S. et al., 2009), which suggested that
an association may exist between Salmonella-contaminated food
and salmonellosis in these age groups.

Similar antibiotic resistance patterns were observed in
Salmonella isolated from CB and SH. Of 21 Salmonella
isolated from CB, high antibiotic resistance rates were found

for ampicillin (20/21, 95.2%), nalidixic acid (18/21, 85.7%),
cefotaxime (17/21, 81%), and tetracycline (13/21, 61.9%); and
18 out of 21 Salmonella were MDR isolates (85.7%). Among 19
Salmonella isolated from SH, high antibiotic resistance rates were
found for nalidixic acid (19/19, 100%), tetracycline (19/19, 100%),
ampicillin (18/19, 94.7%), and ciproﬂoxacin (13/19, 68.4%); and
17 of 19 Salmonella were MDR strains (89.5%). No signiﬁcant
diﬀerence (P > 0.05) in the prevalence of MDR Salmonella
between CB and SH. Of note, co-resistance to ciproﬂoxacin and
cefotaxime in these Salmonella strains would limit therapeutic
options in clinical practice (Whichard et al., 2007).

All class 1 integron-positive isolates in this study exhibited
resistance to at least two classes of antibiotics, which supports the
hypothesis that there is a strong association between the presence
of class I integron and the emerging of MDR in Salmonella
(Wannaprasat et al., 2011; Firoozeh et al., 2012).

All Salmonella isolates in this study carried blaTEM−1 genes,
38 of which showed were resistant to ampicillin. Noticeably, one
blaCMY−2- producing Salmonella isolate was detected, which has
been observed in chicken meat in 2010-2011 in Sichuan province
of China (Li et al., 2013). Because blaCMY−2 can encode antibiotic
resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, which is frequently
used to treat cases of salmonellosis (Gonzalez-Sanz et al., 2009),
the dissemination of blaCMY−2- positive Salmonella via poultry
meat products has pivotal public health implications. Therefore,
the poultry industry should follow prudent management by
establishing more eﬀective disinfection guidelines to reduce
the population of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Moreover, a
moderate use of antibiotics may help prevent the occurrence of
antibiotic resistance in pathogens (Chen and Jiang, 2014).

CONCLUSION

To our best knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study in China comparing
the prevalence and characteristics of Salmonella isolated from
chicken meat samples of CB and SH. Regardless of chicken meat
type, 25% (10/40) of the Salmonella isolates in this study carried
ESBL-producing genes; 22.5% (9/40) of the Salmonella isolates
contained class 1 integrons. Therefore, the reasonable use of
antibiotics in animal husbandry should be taken, and continued
long-term surveillance of Salmonella in animal-derived foods is
warranted.
