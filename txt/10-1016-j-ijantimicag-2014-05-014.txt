In  this   study,   130   non-Typhi   Salmonella   enterica   isolates   from   chickens   were   analysed   for   the   prevalence
of  plasmid-mediated   quinolone   resistance   (PMQR)   determinants   as   well   as   the   co-existence   of  oqxAB  and
␤-lactamase   (ESBL)   genes.   The   genes   oqxAB,   aac(6(cid:3))-Ib-cr,   blaCTX-M-9G and   blaTEM were
extended-spectrum  
present   alone   or   in   combination   in   40   (30.8%),   40   (30.8%),   55  (42.3%)   and  2  (1.5%)   isolates,   respectively.
Most   of  the  oqxAB–blaCTX-M-9G-positive   isolates   (17/28)   carried   transferable   ST2-IncHI2   plasmids   contain-
ing   an  oqxAB   cassette   and  blaCTX-M-14 ﬂanked   by   insertion   sequences   IS10   or   ISEcp1   upstream   and   IS903
downstream.   The   oqxAB–blaCTX-M-9G-positive   isolates   from   a  local   area   showed   similar   pulsed-ﬁeld   gel
electrophoresis   (PFGE)   patterns,   whilst   the   isolates   from   different   areas   were   genetically   divergent,   sug-
gesting   that   both   clonal   expansion   in   local   areas   and   horizontal   transmission   contributed   to  the   spread
of   ST2-IncHI2   plasmids   containing   oqxAB   and   blaCTX-M-14.   This   is   the   ﬁrst   report   on  the   prevalence   of   ST2-
IncHI2   plasmids   concomitantly   carrying   oqxAB   and  blaCTX-M-14 in   Salmonella   and   also   the   ﬁrst   description
of   the  genetic   environment   of   oqxAB–blaCTX-M.  The   genetic   linkage   of  oqxAB–blaCTX-M-9G in  non-Typhi
Salmonella   likely   facilitates   the   spread   of  antibiotic-resistant   Salmonella   and   poses   a  threat   for   clinical
treatment   of   salmonellosis.

1.  Introduction

To  date,  three  types  of  plasmid-mediated  quinolone  resistance
(PMQR)  mechanisms  have  been  described:  the  pentapeptide  repeat
family  Qnr  proteins  (QnrA,  QnrB,  QnrS,  QnrD  and  QnrC);  AAC(6(cid:3))-
Ib-cr,  an  aminoglycoside  acetyltransferase  responsible  for  reduced
susceptibility  to  ciproﬂoxacin  by  modifying  antibiotics;  and  the
efﬂux  pumps  QepA  and  OqxAB  [1].  PMQR  determinants  have  been
shown  to  be  widespread  and  can  confer  low-level  resistance  to
quinolones  [1,2].  OqxAB  is  one  of  the  ﬁrst  plasmid-borne  efﬂux
pumps  of  the  resistance–nodulation–cell  division  (RND)  family
and  the  ﬁrst  identiﬁed  mechanism  of  resistance  to  olaquindox
[3].  OqxAB  is  encoded  by  the  oqxA  and  oqxB  genes  and  confers
resistance  to  multiple  agents,  including  (ﬂuoro)quinolones  such
as  nalidixic  acid,  ciproﬂoxacin  and  norﬂoxacin  as  well  as  chlor-
amphenicol  and  biocides  [4].  Carriage  of  oqxAB  on  transferable

plasmids  facilitates  the  emergence  of  ﬂuoroquinolone  resistance
and  its  transmission  via  horizontal  gene  transfer  [5].  Recently,
our  group  observed  clonal  dissemination  of  IncHI2-type  plasmids
containing  oqxAB  in  Salmonella  enterica  serotype  Typhimurium
in  food-producing  animals  [6].  Fortunately,  these  plasmids  could
not  confer  resistance  to  broad-spectrum  cephalosporins.  However,
IncHI2-type  plasmids  have  recently  been  implicated  in  the  spread
␤-lactamases  (ESBLs)  and
of  genes  encoding  extended-spectrum 
are  known  to  play  a  key  role  in  the  acquisition  of  antibiotic  resis-
tance  [7].
Reports  on  the  prevalence  of  coexistence  of  PMQR,  espe-
cially  aac(6(cid:3))-Ib-cr,   and  ESBL  genes  in  the  same  Salmonella  and
Escherichia  coli  isolates  have  increased  in  recent  years  [7,8].  How-
ever,  there 
information  regarding  the  distribution  of
oqxAB–ESBL-positive  isolates,  and  detailed  information  on  the  plas-
mid   containing  oqxAB  and  ESBLs  in  non-Typhi  serotypes  of  S.
enterica  (hereafter  referred  to  as  non-Typhi  Salmonella)   is  lacking.
The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  investigate  PMQR  determinants  and
ESBL  genes  as  well  as  gain  a  molecular  insight  into  the  distribution
of  non-Typhi  Salmonella  isolates  harbouring  both  oqxAB  and  ESBLs
derived  from  chickens.

2.  Materials  and  methods

2.3.  Molecular  typing

2.1.  Bacterial  strains  and  susceptibility  testing

In  total,  130  non-Typhi  Salmonella  isolates  were  obtained  from
1500  faecal  swabs  of  chickens  at  12  poultry  farms  in  Shandong
Province  (China)  between  March  2012  and  May  2013.  Mini-
mum   inhibitory  concentrations  (MICs)  of  quinolones  (nalidixic
acid),  ﬂuoroquinolones  (ciproﬂoxacin,  enroﬂoxacin  and  levoﬂox-
acin),  third-generation  cephalosporins  (ceftiofur,  cefotaxime  and
ceftazidime)  and  other  antimicrobials  [olaquindox,  ampicillin,
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole  (SXT),  tetracycline,  gentamicin,
amikacin,  chloramphenicol  and  ﬂorfenicol]  (Sigma  Chemical  Co.,  St
Louis,  MO)   were  determined  by  the  agar  dilution  method  follow-
ing  the  guidelines  of  the  Clinical  and  Laboratory  Standards  Institute
(CLSI).  Breakpoints  for  each  antimicrobial  were  recommended  by
the  CLSI  (M100-S18  and  VET01-A4/VET01-S2)  [9,10]  and  DANMAP
98  (olaquindox).  Escherichia  coli  ATCC  25922  was  used  as  a  qual-
ity  control  strain.  ESBL-producing  isolates  were  inferred  by  the
double-disc  synergy  test  using  cefotaxime  or  ceftazidime  and  ticar-
cillin/clavulanic  acid  (Sigma  Chemical  Co.)  as  recommended  by  the
CLSI  [9,10].

2.2.  Detection  of  resistance  genes

The  presence  of  PMQR  determinants,  including  qnrA,  qnrB,  qnrS,
qnrD,  qnrC,  aac(6(cid:3))-Ib-cr,   qepA  and  oqxAB,   was  detected  among  the
130  non-Typhi  Salmonella  isolates  by  PCR  as  described  previously
[6,11,12].  ESBL  genes  in  ESBL-producing  isolates  were  determined
by  PCR  with  previously  reported  oligonucleotide  primers,  includ-
ing  blaTEM,  blaSHV and  blaCTX-M [13].  All  PCR  products  were  directly
sequenced  and  the  results  were  compared  with  those  in  the  Gen-
Bank  nucleotide  database  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/).

Genomic  DNA  of  oqxAB–ESBL-positive  isolates  was  analysed
by  pulsed-ﬁeld  gel  electrophoresis  (PFGE)  following  digestion
with  XbaI  [14].  Comparison  of  PFGE  patterns  was  performed
with  BioNumerics  software  (Applied  Maths,  Sint-Martens-Latem,
Belgium).  Dendrograms  were  generated  with  the  Dice  similar-
ity  coefﬁcient  (1.5%  optimisation  and  1.5%  tolerance)  using  the
unweighted  pair-group  method  with  arithmetic  mean  (UPGMA),
and  PFGE  types  were  deﬁned  with  >90%  similarity  between  clusters
[8].

2.4.  Conjugation  and  transformation  analysis

Isolates  harbouring  both  oqxAB  and  ESBLs  were  selected  for
conjugation  and  transformation  experiments.  Conjugation  experi-
ments  were  carried  out  by  the  liquid  mating-out  assay  as  described
previously  [15].  Transconjugants  were  selected  by  plating  onto
MacConkey  agar  (Huankai  Co.  Ltd.,  Guangzhou,  China)  containing
50  mg/L  sodium  azide  and  0.05  mg/L  ciproﬂoxacin.  Plasmids  not
transferable  by  conjugation  were  studied  by  transformation  assay.
Plasmid  DNA  from  donors  was   extracted  using  a  QIAGEN  Prep  Plas-
mid   Midi  Kit  (QIAGEN,  Hilden,  Germany).  Puriﬁed  plasmids  were
used  to  transform  E.  coli  DH5␣
  (TaKaRa  Biotechnology,  Dalian,
China)  by  electroporation  following  the  manufacturer’s  instruc-
tions.  Transformants  were  incubated  at  37 ◦C  for  1  h  and  were
then  selected  on  Luria–Bertani  agar  (Huankai  Co.  Ltd.)  containing
0.05  mg/L  ciproﬂoxacin.

2.5.  Plasmid  analyses

Incompatibility  (Inc)  groups  were  assigned  by  PCR-based
replicon  typing  of  transconjugants  [16].  Plasmids  in  transcon-
jugants/transformants  were  analysed  by  S1  nuclease-PFGE  and

Southern  blot  hybridisation  with  probes  speciﬁc  for  oqxA,  oqxB,
aac(6(cid:3))-Ib-cr  and  ESBL  genes  as  well  as  with  probes  for  each
gene  used  to  identify  the  plasmid  replicon  type  (Roche  Diag-
nostics  GmbH,  Mannheim,  Germany).  Each  probe  was   made
by  PCR  ampliﬁcation  with  the  primers  in  Supplementary  Table
S1.  Mobilisable  plasmid  relaxases  (MOB)  typing  and  plasmid
double-locus  sequence  typing  (pDLST)  for  IncHI2  plasmids  were
performed  as  previously  described  [7,17].  The  oqxAB–ESBL-positive
plasmids  were  further  analysed  by  restriction  fragment  length
polymorphism  (RFLP)  using  EcoRI  as  the  endonuclease  (TaKaRa
Biotechnology).

in  the  online  version,  at  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.
2014.05.014.

The  ﬂanking  regions  of  oqxAB–ESBLs  were  determined  by
the  primer  walking  method  on  both  DNA  strands,  and  the  par-
tial  sequence  was  used  to  design  primers  for  PCR-RFLP  analysis
of  the  remaining  oqxAB–ESBL-positive  plasmids  (Supplementary
Table  S1).  The  detailed  locations  of  primers  are  presented  in
Fig.  1  (designated  A–C).  In  addition,  the  genetic  environment  of
oqxAB–aac(6(cid:3))-Ib-cr-positive  plasmids  was  analysed  as  described
previously  [6].

2.6.  Nucleotide  sequence  accession  numbers

The  partial  nucleotide  sequences  in  oqxAB–blaCTX-M-14-positive
plasmids  pSDB22  and  pSDB58  have  been  submitted  to  GenBank
and  assigned  accession  nos.  KF746160  and  KF840373,  respectively.

ˇ-lactamase-encoding

Among  the  130  non-Typhi  Salmonella  isolates,  PMQR  determi-
nants  were  present  in  73  (56.2%),  with  oqxAB  and  aac(6(cid:3))-Ib-cr
being  detected  in  40  (30.8%)  and  40  (30.8%)  strains,  respectively.
blaCTX-M-9G genes  (55/130;  42.3%)  were  found  to  be  dominant  in
the  isolates  with  ESBL  production,  and  two  blaTEM-1-positive  iso-
lates  were  negative  for  oqxAB  (2/130;  1.5%).  The  qnrA,  qnrB,  qnrC,
qnrD  and  qepA  genes  as  well  as  the  ESBL-encoding  gene  blaSHV were
not  detected  in  any  of  the  isolates  tested.  Of  the  40  oqxAB-positive
isolates,  28  were  detected  to  harbour  blaCTX-M-9G (blaCTX-M-14 and
blaCTX-M-65),  whereas  it  was  detected  in  27  of  the  90  oqxAB-negative
isolates  (P  <  0.001).  In  addition,  four  oqxAB–blaCTX-M-9G-positive
isolates  were  found  to  harbour  aac(6(cid:3))-Ib-cr  (Table  1).

3.3.  Pulsed-ﬁeld  gel  electrophoresis

Of  the  28  oqxAB–blaCTX-M-9G-positive  non-Typhi  Salmonella  iso-
lates,  26  were  successfully  typed  by  PFGE  and  were  grouped  into
13  PFGE  clusters  designated  A–M  (Fig.  2).  Three  major  PFGE  clus-
ters  A,  E  and  K  accounted  for  26.9%  (7/26),  15.4%  (4/26)  and  15.4%
(4/26)  of  the  isolates,  respectively.  In  addition,  most  of  these  iso-
lates  except  one  (B51)  were  identiﬁed  as  serotype  Indiana,  whereas
the  remaining  PFGE  clusters  comprised  only  one  or  two   isolates
each,  and  three  isolates  belonging  to  clusters  D,  H  and  L  were  iden-
tiﬁed  as  serotype  Enteritidis.

3.4.  Co-transfer  of  oqxAB  and  blaCTX-M-9G genes

In  this  study,  5  transconjugants  and  23  transformants  were
successfully  obtained  from  28  oqxAB–blaCTX-M-9G-positive  isolates
by  conjugation/transformation  experiments.  Five  transconjugants
and  14  transformants  carried  both  oqxAB  and  blaCTX-M-9G genes.
The  ciproﬂoxacin  MICs  of  the  transconjugants/transformants
increased  4–16-fold  (0.03125–0.125  mg/L)  compared  with  the
recipient  E.  coli  J53  (0.008  mg/L)  and  E.  coli  DH5␣
  (0.016  mg/L),
respectively.  For  third-generation  cephalosporins,  all  transconju-
gants/transformants  showed  extremely  high-level  resistance  to
cefotaxime  and  ceftiofur  (32–128  mg/L)  at  the  same  level  as  the
donor  strains.  In  addition,  co-transfer  of  resistance  to  olaquindox,
nalidixic  acid,  ampicillin,  chloramphenicol,  ﬂorfenicol,  tetracycline,
gentamicin  and  SXT  was   also  observed 
in  some  transconju-
gants/transformants.

3.5.  Plasmid  analysis

The  results  of  S1-PFGE  and  Southern  blot  hybridisation  revealed
that  oqxAB  and  blaCTX-M-9G co-located  on  the  same  plasmid  in
19  (67.9%)  of  the  28  oqxAB–blaCTX-M-9G-positive  isolates,  and  all
of  them  belonged  to  the  IncHI2  type  with  size  varying  between
145.5  kb  and  388  kb.  Furthermore,  results  obtained  by  MOB   typing
and  pDLST  indicated  that  all  IncHI2  plasmids  detected  belonged
to  the  MOBH11 subgroup,  and  89.5%  (17/19)  of  them  belonged
to  group  ST2  (Table  1).  Meanwhile,  all  ﬁve  blaCTX-M-65-positive
plasmids  were  negative  for  oqxAB.   In  addition,  aac(6(cid:3))-Ib-cr  and
oqxAB  were  co-localised  on  the  plasmid  extracted  from  isolate
D25,  and  it  presented  the  same  genetic  environment  of  oqxAB  as
described  previously  (Table  1)  [6].  Most  of  the  oqxAB–blaCTX-M-14-
positive  plasmids  shared  very  different  RFLP  patterns.  However,  the
plasmids  isolated  from  A44,  B6,  D20,  B32  and  A100  showed  iden-
tical  RFLP  patterns  (Supplementary  Fig.  S1).  The  ﬂanking  regions
of  oqxAB–blaCTX-M-14 were  determined  in  plasmid  pSDB22  and
pSDB58  isolated  from  B22  and  B58,  respectively.  The  genetic
environment  of  oqxAB–blaCTX-M-14 consisted  of  an  oqxAB  cassette
ﬂanked  by  IS26  and  a  blaCTX-M-14 region  ﬂanked  by  IS10  and  IS903
in  pSDB22  (Fig.  1).  In  addition,  the  aforementioned  two   regions
SCH-142,  which  was   trun-
were  linked  by  a  hypothetical  protein 
cated  by  IS26  and  IS10.   However,  blaCTX-M-14 was   ﬂanked  by  ISEcp1
traI  located  upstream  (Fig.  1).
and  IS903  in  pSDB58,  with  ﬁp  and 
Digestion  of  the  amplicons  indicated  that  89.5%  (17/19)  of  the
oqxAB–blaCTX-M-14-positive  plasmids  presented  the  same  genetic
environment  of  oqxAB  as  pSDB22,  whilst  the  others  (B58  and  B21)
showed  a  genetic  environment  identical  to  that  of  pSDB58  (Sup-
plementary  Fig.  S2).

Fig.  2.  Pulsed-ﬁeld  gel  electrophoresis  (PFGE)  analysis,  serotype  and  location  of  26  oqxAB–blaCTX-M-9G-positive  non-Typhi  Salmonella  enterica  isolates.  LY,  BZ,  QD,   TA  and  WF

and  broad-spectrum  cephalosporin-resistant  strains,  respectively
[18].  In  the  present  study,  a  high  prevalence  of  PMQR  determinants
[oqxAB  (30.8%)  and  aac(6(cid:3))-Ib-cr  (30.8%)]  was  found  in  the  non-
Typhi  Salmonella  isolates,  similar  to  our  previous  work  [6].  This  was
signiﬁcantly  higher  than  that  reported  for  non-Typhi  Salmonella
isolates  in  the  USA  (0.3%)  [19].  The  ESBL  gene  blaCTX-M-9G (42.3%)
was  most  prevalent  in  the  non-Typhi  Salmonella  isolates,  which
is  higher  than  that  reported  for  isolates  from  humans  and  food
animals  in  the  USA  [20].  Moreover,  a  high  prevalence  (21.5%)  of
isolates  carrying  both  oqxAB  and  blaCTX-M-9G was  detected.  Fluo-
roquinolones  and  third-generation  cephalosporins  are  commonly
used  to  treat  Gram-negative  bacterial  infections  [21].  Dissem-
ination  of  blaCTX-M-9G may   facilitate  the  spread  and 
increase
the  prevalence  of  cephalosporin-resistant  strains.  Although  the
PMQR  determinants  contribute  to  small  increases  in  the  MICs  of
quinolones,  they  are  sufﬁcient  to  facilitate  the  selection  of  mutants
(e.g.  gyrA)  with  higher  levels  of  resistance  [1].  Therefore,  we  should
devote  enough  attention  to  the  high  prevalence  of  isolates  carrying
both  oqxAB  and  blaCTX-M-9G.

Salmonella  Indiana  oqxAB–blaCTX-M-9G-positive  strains  isolated
from  the  same  location  (Linyi,  Qingdao  and  Tai’an)  belonged  to
identical  PFGE  clusters  (A,  E  and  K),  indicating  that  clonal  spread
especially  of  Salmonella  Indiana  strains  was  responsible  for  the
dissemination  of  oqxAB–blaCTX-M-9G-positive  strains  in  local  areas.
This  result  supported  the  assumption  that  trade  of  animals  may
be  an  important  source  of  colonisation  [22].  In  addition,  the  spo-
radic  oqxAB–blaCTX-M-9G-positive  Salmonella  Enteritidis  should  be
of  concern.  However,  Salmonella  strains  that  showed  diverse  PFGE
patterns  presented  a  similar  multidrug  resistance  phenotype.  This
is  probably  due  to  the  spread  of  resistance  plasmids.

Characterisation  by  pDLST,  S1-PFGE  and  Southern  blot  hybrid-
isation  showed 
that  oqxAB  co-resided  with  blaCTX-M-14 on
transferable  ST2-IncHI2  plasmids  in  most  of  the  oqxAB–blaCTX-M-14-
positive  strains.  Although  RFLP  analysis  presented  a  different
backbone  between  pSDB22  and  pHXY0908  (data  not  shown),  the
analysis  provided  supporting  evidence  for  our  previous  hypothe-
sis  that  oqxAB-positive  IncHI2-type  plasmids  are  correlated  with
ESBLs  [6].  Different  from  previously  reported  ﬁndings  that  PMQR
and  ESBL  genes  are  frequently  co-located  on  ST1-IncHI2  plasmids,

this  study  found  that  the  PMQR–ESBL  genetic  linkage  was  mostly
associated  with  ST2-IncHI2  plasmids,  which  are  also  known  for
epidemic  spread  in  Salmonella  strains  from  human  and  animals  in
Europe  and  the  USA.

The  genetic  environment  of  oqxAB–blaCTX-M-14 in  pSDB22
consisted  of  a  backbone  that  is  similar  to  the  S.  Typhimurium  plas-
mid   pHXY0908  and  a  plasmid  from  E.  coli  DDC10-15  [6,23].  This
organisation  was   common  (17/28)  in  oqxAB–blaCTX-M-14-positive
strains  found  by  PCR-RFLP  analysis,  indicating  that  the  spread  of
oqxAB  in  combination  with  blaCTX-M-14 will  become  increasingly
prevalent  in  China  [24].  It  is  noteworthy  that  both  oqxAB  and
blaCTX-M-14 genes  were  ﬂanked  by  insertion  sequences,  which  are
widely  spread  among  plasmids  and  contribute  to  the  dissemination
of  resistance  genes.

features  associated  with 

Interestingly,  some  unique 

the
oqxAB–blaCTX-M-14 genetic  environment  are  identiﬁed  in  this  study.
(i)  The  ISEcp1  element  was  frequently  found  to  be  associated  with
several  blaCTX-M genes  and  could  mobilise  such  genes,  and  this
organisation  was   also  detected  in  pSDB58  [25].  However,  this  inser-
tion  sequence  was   disrupted  by  another  insertion  sequence,  IS10,
located  upstream  of  blaCTX-M-14,  and  IS10  may  play  a  role  in  the
mobilisation  of  this  ESBL  gene  [26].  (ii)  The  hypothetical  protein
SCH-142  truncated  by  IS26  and  IS10  was  ﬁrst  identiﬁed  in  plasmid
pSC138,  which  was   isolated  from  a  highly  invasive  and  multiresis-
tant  non-Typhi  Salmonella  isolate  [27].  The  residue  of  ISEcp1  located
SCH-142.  Meanwhile,  the
upstream  of  IS10  has  been  replaced  by 
MICs  of  third-generation  cephalosporins  for  strain  B58  were  higher
SCH-142  on  expression  of
than  in  B22.  The  potential  effect  of 
blaCTX-M-14 needs  further  research.

In  summary,  we  report  the  high  prevalence  of  blaCTX-M-9G among
oqxAB-positive  non-Typhi  Salmonella  from  chickens  in  China.  The
spread  of  blaCTX-M-9G and  oqxAB  in  these  isolates  was  mediated
by  clonal  expansion  in  local  areas  and  horizontal  transmission  of
ST2-IncHI2  plasmids  containing  the  oqxAB–blaCTX-M-14 genes.  To
our  knowledge,  this  is  the  ﬁrst  report  of  the  prevalence  of  ST2-
IncHI2  plasmids  concomitantly  carrying  oqxAB  and  blaCTX-M-14 in
non-Typhi  Salmonella,   and  also  the  ﬁrst  description  of  the  genetic
environment  of  oqxAB–blaCTX-M.  The  presence  of  these  genes  in
non-Typhi  Salmonella  strains  isolated  from  food-producing  animals

poses  a  potential  threat  to  public  health,  and  continued  surveil-
lance  of  the  dissemination  of  these  genes  in  Salmonella  is  urgently
needed.
