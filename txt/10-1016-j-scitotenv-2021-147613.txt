The recent emergence of mobile-tigecycline resistance tet(X) genes in human and animals in China seriously
threats the clinical utility of tigecycline. Here we focused on the isolation and molecular characterization of
plasmid-mediated tigecycline resistance tet(X4)-positive E. coli from different sources in Pakistan using MinION
and Illumina sequencing. The tet(X4) gene was detected in four E. coli isolates from poultry, chicken meat, wild
bird and the slaughterhouse wastewater in Pakistan. Co-existence of colistin resistance mcr-1 gene was also de-
tected in three isolates. The four isolates belonged to different sequence types and the tet(X4) gene was located
on plasmids ranging from 12,331 bp to 113,610 bp belonging to IncFII and IncQ replicon types with two genetic
contexts ISCR2-tet(X4)-abh-ISCR2-lysR-ﬂoR-virD2 and ΔISCR2-abh-tet(X4)-ISCR2-virD2-ﬂoR, respectively.
In all the four E. coli strains, tet(X4) was transferable by conjugation to E. coli J53 host strain. In addition, three of
four strains transferred tet(X4) to a wild-type carbapenem resistant E. coli strain. To our knowledge, this is the
ﬁrst report of the emergence of plasmid-mediated tet(X4) gene from Pakistan. The convergence of tigecycline
and colistin resistance in South Asia is a serious threat to human health.

1. Introduction

3. Results and discussion

Tigecycline is a last resort antibiotic to treat infections caused by ex-
tensively resistant (e.g. carbapenem- and colistin-resistant) Gram-
negative bacteria (Fang et al., 2020); therefore, the recent emergence of
mobile tigecycline resistance highlights the threat of an impending return
to the pre-antibiotic era. Until recently, mechanisms of tigecycline resis-
tance were restricted to chromosomal mutations which cannot be trans-
ferred between bacteria. However, in 2019, He et al. reported two
transferable plasmid-mediated tigecycline resistance genes, tet(X3) and
tet(X4) in Gram-negative bacterial
isolates (Escherichia coli and
Acinetobacter baumannii) from human and animal sources in China (He
et al., 2019). The Tet(X) proteins are ﬂavin monooxygenases that catalyze
the degradation of tetracyclines including tigecycline, eravacycline and
omadacycline. Recently increased reports of tigecycline resistance genes
tet(X3/X4) and other variants have emerged, mainly from Mainland
China and Singapore (Zhang et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020). For the ﬁrst
time, we report evidence of plasmid-mediated tigecycline resistance
gene tet(X4) in E. coli isolates from different sources in South Asia.

2. Materials and methods

In an on-going surveillance of mobile colistin resistance in E. coli, from
human, over 1100 samples were collected from human, animals, food and
environmental sources from Faisalabad, Pakistan. We detected four E. coli
isolates displaying high-level tigecycline resistance (MIC ≥16 mg/L). PCR
was conducted to conﬁrm the presence of a tigecycline resistance gene,
in this case tet(X4), using primers described earlier (He et al., 2019).
Antimicrobial resistance phenotypes of isolates were determined by
disc diffusion. All E. coli isolates carrying tet(X4) were subjected to WGS
using both MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK) and MiSeq
(Illumina, USA) platforms followed by in-silico analysis for antibiotic resis-
tance genes, virulence genes, multi-locus sequence type (MLST) and
genetic context of tet(X4) (Supplementary material). Conjugations were
performed using sodium azide resistant E. coli J53, and wild-type E. coli
strains from human microbiota (C351, phylogroup A), human clinical
(N23 phylogroup D) and animal origin (CX17, phylogroup B2) as recipi-
ent strains. Growth curves were constructed for control and conjugated
strains using protocols described in Supplementary material.

The complete sequences of the chromosome and plasmids of strains

have been submitted to GenBank under project code PRJNA683023.

3.1. Characteristics of tet(X4)-positive E. coli

The four E. coli strains were collected in 2018–19 and originated
from broilers, chicken meat, slaughterhouse wastewater and a wild-
bird. Worryingly, co-occurrence with mobile colistin resistance mcr-1
gene was also detected in three strains (PK-2248, PK-2340 and PK-
4375) (Table 1). All the strains were resistant to three or more antibi-
otics (multi-drug resistant) and carried ≥6 virulence associated genes
(Table 2). MLST analysis categorize the strains into the following ST
groups: ST6726 (PK-2248), ST694 (PK-2340), ST4388 (PK-4114) and
ST224 (PK-4375), implying the tet(X4)-bearing E. coli strains are
found in diverse phylogenetic clades (Table 1). The genome size of chro-
mosomes and plasmids of all the strains are given in Table S1.

3.2. Genetic characterization of tet(X4) and mcr-1 bearing plasmids

The tet(X4)-positive plasmids pPK-2248-tetX4, pPK-2340-tetX4,
pPK-4114-tetX4 and pPK-4375-tetX4, ranged in size from 12 kbp to
113 kbp (Table 1). The tet(X4)-bearing plasmids of PK-2248, PK-2340
and PK-4114 belonged to the IncFII group and showed high-level
homology with IncFII plasmids (Fig. 1a). In addition to tet(X4), these
IncFII
tet(X4)-positive plasmids also harbored other important
resistance genes, such as mph(A) (macrolide resistance), dfrA12
(diaminopyrimidine resistance) and ﬂoR (phenicol
resistance)
(Fig. 1a). The immediate genetic context of tet(X4) on three plasmids
had the same 9 kb region (Fig. 1c). This 9 kb tet(X4)-bearing genetic re-
gion was also found previously from the chromosome of Aeromonas
caviae WCW1–2 (CP039832) and the plasmid of E. coli CD63-2-1
(CP050041) with an extra truncated ISCR2 region upstream of tet(X4)
on both sequences (Chen et al., 2019; Lv et al., 2020). A putative
composite transposon with two identical IS26 elements ﬂanking the
9 kb region were observed in three IncFII plasmids from this study
(Fig. 1c). A BLASTn search of pPK-2248-tetX4 against the NCBI nr data-
base retrieved other similar IncFII type tet(X4)-negative plasmids
pGD0503Z13 (KR653209) and pST45-1 (CP050754) of chicken and a
patient in China. However, the most similar IncFII tet(X4)-bearing plas-
mid was pRF65_113kb_ﬂye (at 59% coverage in 98.08% identity) discov-
ered in China (Li et al., 2020) (Fig. 1a), indicating widespread global
transmission.

Fig. 2. Comparative genomics and genetic environments of mcr-1 plasmid in this study (a) Structures of mcr-1 bearing IncI2 plasmids pPK-2248-mcr-1, pPK-2340-mcr-1 and pPK-4375-
mcr-1 and comparison to other similar plasmids. (b) Genetic context of mcr-1 region identiﬁed in IncI2 plasmid was visualized using Easyﬁg. The arrows represent the positions and tran-
scriptional directions of ORFs. Regions of homology are marked by grey shading and mcr-1 gene is colored in red.

Additionally, strain PK-4375 carried tet(X4) gene on a IncQ1 type
plasmid, pPK-4375-tetX4. The tet(X4) gene was on a 6,698 bp region on
pPK-4375-tetX4 with the genetic structure ΔISCR2-abh-tet(X4)-ISCR2-
virD2-ﬂoR (Fig. 1b). This 7 kb region was the same as the G3-2 type tet
(X4) region previously reported (Li et al., 2020), which illustrates that
this genetic structure/plasmid may transfer between different source
strains. Moreover, the plasmid backbone of pPK-4375-tetX4 was highly
similar to other reported plasmids including pig E. coli pLHM10-1
(CP037909) and wastewater E. coli pRW8-1_122k_tetX (MT219826)
(Fig. 1b). The 12,331 bp plasmid pPK-4375-tetX4 only contained tet(X4)

and ﬂoR resistance gene differing from other reported IncQ plasmids (Li
et al., 2017a, 2017b; Loftie-Eaton and Rawlings, 2012). IncQ type plasmids
have a broad host-range and are thought to disseminate through bac-
terial population found in sewage and other environments (Stalder
et al., 2019). The arise of tet(X4)-positive IncQ-type plasmids E. coli
strains form different sectors greatly enhances the risk of tet(X4)
horizontal transfer.

The co-resistance of tigecycline with colistin resistance is worri-
some. All three mcr-1-positive plasmids belonged to IncI2 type and
shared >99% nucleotide identity with each other. Our IncI2-type

4

plasmids showed high similarity to those recovered from NCBI nr data-
base plasmids pK18JST013 (CP065423, Salmonella) and pZJ3920-3
(CP020548, E. coli) (Fig. 2a). Compared with the originally reported
IncI2 mcr-1 plasmid pHNSP45, these three plasmids all lacked the
ISApl1 element ﬂanking the mcr-1 gene (Fig. 2b), which may stabilize
the mcr-1 gene. This structure was also found in strains from other
countries including Pakistan (Ji et al., 2019; Li et al., 2017a, 2017b;
Mohsin et al., 2019b), which imply this type of plasmids is globally
widespread. Beside mcr-1, no other antimicrobial resistance gene was
found on mcr-1 bearing plasmids.

3.3. Conjugation and ﬁtness cost

All tet(X4) carrying strains of this study displayed conjugation with
E. coli J53. In addition, PK-2340, PK-4114 and Pk-4375 also transfer tet
(X4) to E. coli N23 (a wild-type clinical strain from Indian origin)
which also carries blaNDM-1 (Table 1). No conjugation to other wild-
type E. coli strains (CX351 and CX17) was observed. Furthermore,
growth curves of the transconjugates and control strains demonstrated
no ﬁtness cost with wild-type E. coli strain, N23 (transconjugate Tc2340.
N1; p-value = 0.0291). In contrast, tet(X4) plasmid acquisition by E. coli
J53 displayed a signiﬁcant ﬁtness cost to its transconjugate, Tc2258.J1
(p-value ≤ 0.0001), Tc4114.J1 (p-value = 0.0014) and Tc2340.J1
(p-value ≤ 0.0001) (Fig. 3).

Tetracyclines are the most commonly used antibiotics in food pro-
ducing animals in Pakistan (Mohsin et al., 2019a; Umair et al., 2020). Se-
lective pressure due to tetracyclines may well be linked to the
emergence of tigecycline resistance in Pakistan. Carbapenem resistance
among Gram-negative bacteria is already a serious challenge in clinical

settings in Indian subcontinent (Stewardson et al., 2019). The possibility
of co-resistance to colistin, tigecycline and carbapenem could pose a cat-
astrophic scenario.

4. Conclusions

To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report on the detection
of tet(X4)-mediated tigecycline resistance from multiple non-clinical
sources from South Asia and our data, if extrapolated across the conti-
nent has immense ramiﬁcations for the future treatment of XDR infec-
tions. With the burden carbapenem and colistin resistance already
high in South Asia, these ﬁndings underscore the importance and ur-
gency to counter the emergence and co-existence of mobile tigecycline
and colistin resistant bacteria.
