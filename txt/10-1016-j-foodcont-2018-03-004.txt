ABSTRACT 

25 

 

26 

Salmonellosis, caused by multidrug-resistant Salmonella species, in particular, is one of 

27 

the leading notifiable foodborne diseases in Singapore and an emerging public health 

28 

concern worldwide. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence, 

29 

antibiotic resistance and the presence of gyrA and parC mutations in Salmonella isolated 

30 

from retail fresh chicken meat in Singapore. A significantly higher prevalence of 

31 

Salmonella was found in chicken meat from the wet markets (25%, 30/120), as compared 

32 

to supermarkets (12.7%, 19/150). The top four serovars isolated in this study were S. 

33 

Saintpaul (32.7%, 17/52), followed by S. Brancaster (21.2%, 11/52), S. Albany (11.5%, 

34 

6/52), and S. Stanley (9.6%, 5/52). More than 80% of Salmonella isolates exhibited 

35 

resistance to at least one of eleven antibiotics tested. The most common phenotypic 

36 

resistances exhibited were towards ampicillin (78.8%, 41/52), tetracycline and 

37 

chloramphenicol (61.5%, 32/52), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (55.8%, 29/52) and 

38 

nalidixic acid (30.8%, 16/52). Of the 52 Salmonella isolates, 59.6% (31/52) were multi-

39 

drug resistant strains, resistant to 3 or more antibiotic classes. No mutation in parC gene 

40 

was found in any of the isolates that expressed phenotypic resistance or reduced 

41 

susceptibility towards quinolone and/or fluoroquinolone. Mutations at two different sites 

42 

of gyrA gene were found in 7 isolates, which further discriminates the quinolone 

43 

resistance genotype in Salmonella isolates from fresh chicken meat. Our findings provide 

44 

opportunities for risk assessment and management of salmonellosis and antibiotic-

45 

resistant Salmonella species in the country and the region.

1.  Introduction 

 

Non-typhoidal salmonellosis caused by Salmonella is one of the most common 

52 

foodborne diseases worldwide. In the United States, salmonellosis has been estimated to 

53 

be responsible for 1 million illnesses and attributed to 400 deaths each year (Scallan, et 

54 

al., 2011), and up to 155,000 deaths globally (Majowicz, et al., 2010). In Singapore, non-

55 

typhoidal salmonellosis contributed  56% of all notifiable foodborne and waterborne 

56 

diseases from 2001 to 2010 (Kondakci & Yuk, 2012). The incidence (per 100,000 

57 

population) of non-typhoidal salmonellosis in Singapore has been rising from 26.5 in 

58 

2011 to 35.9 in 2015 due, in part, to the mandatory notification requirement of 

59 

salmonellosis implemented in 2008 (MOH, 2012, 2016; Zwe & Yuk, 2017).  

60 

Chicken meat is one of the most commonly implicated food for human salmonellosis 

61 

(Vandeplas, Dauphin, Beckers, Thonart, & Thewis, 2010). Owing to its ability to reside 

62 

in healthy chickens without causing illness (de Jong, et al., 2014), Salmonella may go 

63 

unnoticed in the farm, thereby posing the risk of salmonellosis through contaminated 

64 

chickens. 

65 

The administration of antibiotics in livestock as growth promoters has been a long-

66 

standing agricultural practice and is primarily associated with the emergence of antibiotic 

67 

resistance in foodborne and livestock-associated bacteria (Thames, Pruden, James, Ray, 

68 

& Knowlton, 2012). In particular, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella has been 

69 

consistently reported in food-producing animals and food globally in the recent decade 

70 

(Abd-Elghany, Sallam, Abd-Elkhalek, & Tamura, 2015; Anjum, et al., 2011; Lettini, et 

71 

al., 2016; Nguyen, et al., 2016; Oueslati, et al., 2016; Rodriguez-Rivera, et al., 2016),

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT72 

resulting in humans being exposed to MDR Salmonella through food. Although mostly 

73 

causing self-limiting gastroenteritis, Salmonella infections can be invasive and potentially 

74 

fatal, especially in children, elderly and immunocompromised individuals (Arshad, et al., 

75 

2008). Administration of antibiotics becomes essential in these cases, with the drugs of 

76 

choice being fluoroquinolones in most cases (Kariuki, Gordon, Feasey, & Parry, 2015). 

77 

Hence, reports indicating evidence of increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones in 

78 

Salmonella (Lettini, et al., 2016; Veldman, et al., 2011; Zhang, et al., 2014) are of 

79 

concern because it could mean a limited choice of therapeutics in the near future. 

80 

   

In Singapore, the Ministry of Health (MOH) annually reports surveillance data of 

81 

reported cases of human salmonellosis. However, to our knowledge, there is no report on 

82 

the contamination rates and antibiotic resistance of Salmonella in raw meat in Singapore. 

83 

Thus, the objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence, sequence 

84 

types/serovars and antibiotic resistance patterns of Salmonella from fresh chicken meat 

85 

available in wet markets and supermarkets in Singapore. Furthermore, possible 

86 

mechanisms of fluoroquinolone and quinolone resistance in Salmonella isolated from 

87 

chicken meat were investigated. Findings from this study may help authorities in 

88 

assessing the possible exposure risk of Salmonella from contaminated chicken meat for 

89 

developing risk mitigation measures, and in evaluating the risk of antibiotic resistance 

90 

hazard in the food supply chain in Singapore and elsewhere. In addition, they also serve 

91 

as valuable data points in future long-term surveillance programs of Salmonella 

92 

contamination patterns and/or antibiotic resistance patterns in the region.

98 

 

2.1. Sample collection and preparation  

 

Sample collection was done between June 2015 and April 2016. Two types of 

99 

markets, namely wet markets and supermarkets, were included in this study for sample 

100 

collection. A total of 120 fresh (chilled) chicken samples were collected (30 breasts, 30 

101 

drum sticks, 30 thighs, 30 whole) from more than 30 different poultry vendors across 10 

102 

wet markets. A total of 150 fresh (chilled) chicken meat samples were collected (30 

103 

breasts, 30 drum sticks, 30 minced, 30 thighs, 30 whole) from 9 outlets across 3 different 

104 

supermarket chains. Each sample of approximately 100 g was individually wrapped 

105 

separately in new and clean plastic bags and transported on ice to the Food Microbiology 

106 

Laboratory of the National University of Singapore. All samples were either tested 

107 

immediately, or stored at 4 ᵒC before being processed within 12 hours from the time of 

108 

collection.  

109 

 

110 

2.2. Isolation and serogrouping of Salmonella species  

111 

112 

 

Isolation of Salmonella from chicken meat samples was carried out according to the 

113 

ISO 6579:2002 (ISO, 2002) as performed previously (Zheng, Mikš-Krajnik, Yang, Xu, & 

114 

Yuk, 2014). Knives, steel trays and wooden chopsticks used to handle the chicken sample 

115 

during the portioning were all sterilized by autoclaving at 121 °C for 15 min in wrapped 

116 

aluminum foil prior to the experiment. The outer packaging of the samples was 

117 

decontaminated with 70% ethanol and left to dry in the biosafety cabinet (BSC; Esco 

 

6 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT118 

Class II, Type A2, E-Series, Esco Micro Pvt. Ltd., Singapore) before handling to prevent 

119 

cross-contamination from the outer packaging to the sample. A 25 g portion of each 

120 

sample was aseptically cut, portioned in the steel trays and weighed on a sterile Petri dish 

121 

in the BSC. Bones were not included in the portions in this experiment. For whole 

122 

chicken carcasses, the sample rinsate was obtained as recommended by the United States 

123 

Department of Agriculture in the document MLG 4.08 (USDA, 2014). Briefly, the whole 

124 

chicken carcass was transferred into a large sterile bag with a filter. A 400 ml of sterile 

125 

BPW was poured into the cavity of the carcass to rinse inside out with a rocking motion 

126 

for 1 min. A 30 ml portion of the sample rinsate was then transferred into a sterile bag 

127 

containing 30 ml of sterile BPW and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Up to three presumptive 

128 

Salmonella colonies from each of the xylose lysine deoxycholate agar (Oxoid) and 

129 

brilliant green agar (Oxoid) were plated onto nutrient agar (Oxoid) to analyze their 

130 

biochemical characteristics using API 20E (BioMérieux®, Inc., Marcy I’Etoile, France) 

131 

that were interpreted by APIWEB software (BioMérieux®). Only colonies that displayed 

132 

a ≥ 95% probability of being identified as Salmonella were taken for the study. If more 

133 

than one Salmonella colony with identical biochemical fingerprints were isolated from a 

134 

common sample, only one Salmonella colony per sample was chosen for further 

135 

characterization. Serogrouping of the Salmonella isolates was carried out using the 

136 

WellcolexTM Colour Salmonella Rapid Latex Agglutination Kit (Thermo Fisher 

137 

Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions.  

138 

 

139 

2.3. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of Salmonella species 

140 

 

 

7 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT141 

Genomic DNA was extracted from the isolates using the GeneJET Genomic DNA 

142 

Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MLST was performed by amplifying and 

143 

sequencing the seven housekeeping gene fragments with primers as described in Table 1. 

144 

Amplifications were carried out in 50 µl reaction volume containing 10 µl of 5x Phusion 

145 

HF buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1 µl of 10 mM dNTP mix (1st BASE, Selangor, 

146 

Malaysia), 1 µl each of 10 µM forward and reverse primers and 0.5 µl of Phusion Hot 

147 

Start II Taq DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) topped up with 31.5 µl 

148 

nuclease-free water (Ambion®, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The PCR was performed as 

149 

follows: 98 °C for 30 sec followed by 35 cycles of denaturation (98 °C for 10 sec), 

150 

annealing (55 °C for 30 sec) and extension (72 °C for 30 sec). A final extension step was 

151 

carried out at 72 °C for 10 min using a Veriti 96 Well Thermal Cycler (Applied 

152 

Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The PCR products were visualized by gel 

153 

electrophoresis in 2% agarose (1st BASE).  

154 

PCR amplicons of the MLST genes were purified using the GeneAll ExpinTM Gel 

155 

SV kit (GeneAll Biotechnology, Seoul, Korea) and sequenced with sequencing primers 

156 

as shown in Table 1 using capillary electrophoresis with Applied Biosystems® 

157 

3730/3730xl DNA Analyzer and BigDye Terminator v3.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 

158 

The reference templates for the seven MLST genes were obtained from the University of 

159 

Warwick (UoW) MLST database (Warwick). Sequences of the PCR products were then 

160 

assembled using the SeqMan Pro version 8.0 (DNASTAR). The obtained consensus 

161 

sequence of each gene was then entered into the UoW MLST database to obtain the 

162 

corresponding allele number for each gene sequence. Sequence type (ST) of each 

163 

Salmonella isolate was obtained by entering in the combination of allele types of the 

 

8 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT164 

seven genes into the UoW MLST database. The corresponding serovar to the obtained ST 

165 

was then ascertained by referring to the database (Achtman, et al., 2012). Serovars of 

166 

ST3633 isolates that could not be ascertained with confidence from the database alone 

167 

were serotyped by slide agglutination test using Salmonella antisera (Bio-Rad 

168 

Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).  

169 

A dendrogram displaying the phylogenetic relationships between different 

170 

Salmonella isolates was constructed using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis 

171 

(MEGA) version 7.0, using the Neighbour-Joining (NJ) method based on concatenated 7 

172 

house-keeping genes determined by MLST.  

173 

 

174 

2.4. Antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) of Salmonella species 

175 

176 

 

The antibiotic susceptibilities of the Salmonella isolates to 11 types across 7 classes 

177 

of antibiotics were tested using the disk diffusion method and the results were interpreted 

178 

according to the breakpoints described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 

179 

(CLSI, 2014). The antibiotic disks (Oxoid) used in the study were as follows: 10 µg 

180 

ampicillin (AMP), 20 µg amoxicillin and 10 µg clavulanate (AMC), 30 µg ceftriaxone 

181 

(CRO), 30 µg tetracycline (TE), 5 µg ciprofloxacin (CIP), 10 µg norfloxacin (NOR), 30 

182 

µg nalidixic acid (NAL), 23.75 µg sulfamethoxazole and 1.25 µg trimethoprim (SXT), 30 

183 

µg chloramphenicol (C), 30 µg amikacin (AMK) and 10 µg gentamicin (CN). The 

184 

isolates were classified as either susceptible, intermediate or resistant as per the CLSI 

185 

breakpoints. Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 

186 

were used as quality control organisms in the AST. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolate 

 

9 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT187 

was defined as an isolate exhibiting resistance towards three or more different antibiotic 

188 

classes as previously described (Nguyen, et al., 2016).  

189 

 

190 

2.5. Detection of mutations in gyrA and parC genes 

191 

192 

 

The genetic features associated with resistance of the isolates to quinolone and 

193 

fluoroquinolone were assessed as previously described by Šeputienė, et al. (2006). The 

194 

32 isolates that displayed either resistant or intermediate phenotype towards nalidixic 

195 

acid and/or ciprofloxacin was analyzed for the presence of any mutations in gyrA and 

196 

parC genes. The quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) of gyrA and parC 

197 

were amplified using the primers (Table 1) in reaction volumes as per the MLST 

198 

methodology described in this study. The PCR protocol used for the amplification was as 

199 

described by Šeputienė, et al. (2006). The PCR products were purified and sequenced as 

200 

described previously. The reference templates of gyrA and parC were downloaded from 

201 

GenBank at the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website 

202 

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) from a S. Saintpaul whole genome with accession 

203 

number GCA_000170215.1. The PCR product sequences were then aligned to the 

204 

reference gene templates, trimmed and assembled as described previously and converted 

205 

into protein sequences using the online translation tool publicly available at ExPASy 

206 

(http://web.expasy.org/translate). The mutations in the QRDR of gyrA and parC amino 

207 

acid sequences leading to quinolone and fluoroquinolone resistance were assessed by 

208 

referring to a panel of known mutations previously compiled and published in 

209 

supplementary materials by Stoesser, et al. (2013).

2.6. Statistical analysis 

212 

213 

 

Statistical comparison of the prevalence of Salmonella by market type and parts was 

214 

carried out using Fisher’s exact test available online at the GraphPad Software 

215 

(https://graphpad.com/quickcalcs/contingency1.cfm) with a significance level set at P < 

216 

0.05. The 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the Adjusted Wald method 

217 

available online at MeasuringU (https://measuringu.com/wald/).

220 

 

221 

3.1. Prevalence of Salmonella species in chicken meat from wet markets and 

222 

223 

224 

supermarkets  

 

Of the 270 chicken meat samples collected from wet markets and supermarkets, 52 

225 

Salmonella isolates were obtained from 49 samples, resulting in a prevalence of 18.1% 

226 

(Table 2). Of the 49 samples detected with Salmonella, 30 samples were from wet 

227 

markets, while 19 samples were from supermarkets, resulting in a prevalence of 25.0% 

228 

(30/120) and 12.7% (19/150), respectively. The prevalence of Salmonella in chicken 

229 

meat from wet markets was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that from supermarkets. 

230 

No significant difference (P ≥ 0.05) in the prevalence between different chicken parts 

231 

was observed.  

 

11 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT232 

A total of 11 different serovars were detected among the 52 Salmonella isolates, with 

233 

the four most frequently isolated serovars being S. Saintpaul (32.7%, 17/52), followed by 

234 

S. Brancaster (21.2%, 11/52), S. Albany (11.5%, 6/52), and S. Stanley (9.6%, 5/52) 

235 

(Table 3). A wider variety of serovars was isolated from the chicken meat samples 

236 

collected from wet markets (10 serovars) as compared to the samples from supermarkets 

237 

(3 serovars). S. Saintpaul and S. Brancaster were detected in both market types and 70% 

238 

(14/20) of all Salmonella isolates from supermarkets’ samples were S. Saintpaul as 

239 

opposed to 9.4% (3/32) of isolates from wet markets’ samples. Isolates of ST3633 were 

240 

found to be S. Albany from the slide agglutination test. 

241 

 

242 

3.2. Distribution of sequence types and serovars based on MLST 

243 

244 

 

A total of 12 distinct sequence types (STs) across 11 serovars were isolated in this 

245 

study (Fig. 1). Two distinct STs (292 and 3633) were found among the S. Albany 

246 

isolates. 

247 

 

248 

3.3. Antibiotic resistance of Salmonella in fresh chicken meat 

249 

250 

 

Antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) revealed that 80.8% (42/52) of isolates were 

251 

resistant to at least one of the antibiotics tested in this study. The most common 

252 

phenotypic resistance exhibited was towards ampicillin followed by tetracycline, 

253 

chloramphenicol, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and nalidixic acid (Fig. 2). Relatively 

254 

low resistance rates (< 10%) were found for ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin while no 

 

12 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT255 

resistance towards amikacin and norfloxacin was found. Of the 52 isolates, 59.6% 

256 

(31/52) of them were multidrug resistant (MDR) isolates (Table 4). The percentage of 

257 

MDR isolates resistant to 3, 4, 5 and 6 classes of antibiotics were 1.9, 17.3, 28.8 and 

258 

11.5% respectively. All S. Albany isolates (n=6) were found to be resistant to at least five 

259 

different classes of antibiotics while all S. Agona isolates (n=4) were susceptible to all 

260 

antibiotics tested. One isolate of S. Albany was found to be resistant to 8 antibiotics with 

261 

a resistance phenotype of AMC-AMP-C-CRO-CIP-NA-SXT-TE. The most common 

262 

resistance phenotype among MDR isolates was AMP-C-SXT-TE (7 isolates, 13.5%) 

263 

followed by AMP-C-CN-SXT-TE (6 isolates, 11.5%) (Table 4).  

264 

 

265 

3.4. Investigation of genetic resistance determinants to quinolones 

266 

 

 

267 

  No mutation in the QRDR of parC gene was observed in any of the isolates tested 

268 

(Table 5). A gyrA mutation responsible for changing the aspartic acid to asparagine 

269 

residue at the 87th position (Asp87Asn) was found in S. Albany isolates (n=6) while a 

270 

mutation causing a change in serine to tyrosine residue at the 83rd position (Ser83Tyr) 

271 

was found in S. Give isolate (n=1).  S. Brancaster and S. Stanley isolates which displayed 

272 

a resistant phenotype to nalidixic acid did not display any mutations in either gyrA or 

273 

parC genes. One isolate (WB2) among S. Albany isolates carrying the Asp87Asn 

274 

mutation, and the S. Give isolate carrying the Ser83Tyr mutation, displayed phenotypic 

275 

resistance towards both nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin.

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT278 

 

279 

 

To our knowledge, there is no other comparable published study on Salmonella 

280 

contamination rates of raw meat items in Singapore. Hence, the prevalence rate found in 

281 

this study could not be compared to any local past data to establish any trend. 

282 

Internationally, this Salmonella prevalence rate of 18.1% in raw chicken in Singapore is 

283 

lower compared to values reported in Vietnam (21.0 % to 65.3% in poultry; Huong, et al., 

284 

2006; Nguyen, et al., 2016; Phan, et al., 2005; Ta, et al., 2014; Van, Moutafis, Istivan, 

285 

Tran, & Coloe, 2007), Egypt (34% in chicken; Abd-Elghany, et al., 2015), Louisiana, 

286 

United States (21.7% in chicken; Lestari, Han, Wang, & Ge, 2009), Maryland, United 

287 

States (56% in chicken; Cui, Ge, Zheng, & Meng, 2005), Anatolia (34% in chicken; 

288 

Yildirim, Gonulalan, Pamuk, & Ertas, 2011), Mexico (35.3% in poultry; Miranda, 

289 

Mondragon, Martinez, Guarddon, & Rodriguez, 2009) and Penang, Malaysia (23.5% in 

290 

ducks; Adzitey, Rusul, & Huda, 2012). The prevalence found in this study is higher 

291 

compared to those in New Zealand (3% in chicken; Wong, Nicol, Cook, & MacDiarmid, 

292 

2007) and United Kingdom (4% in chicken; Meldrum & Wilson, 2007). However, in 

293 

these countries, Campylobacter species tend to be the main contaminant of raw chicken 

294 

instead (Baker, et al., 2006; Meldrum & Wilson, 2007). The lower Salmonella prevalence 

295 

rate in Singapore as compared to many countries could be attributed to the governance of 

296 

food safety and hygiene in Singapore by the combined efforts of the Agri-Food & 

297 

Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) and the National Environment Agency (NEA) 

298 

as succinctly documented by Ludher (2015). 

299 

  Our study showed that the prevalence of Salmonella contamination in raw chicken 

300 

from wet markets was significantly higher than in those from the supermarkets. These 

 

14 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT301 

results suggest that the prevalence of Salmonella species may vary depending on the type 

302 

of retail establishments. Relatively inferior hygiene practices, such as cutting chicken 

303 

meat with shared knife and chopping board without proper cleaning, and displaying 

304 

chicken carcasses in the chillers without physical separation or individual packaging 

305 

could likely contribute to cross-contamination events leading to a significantly higher rate 

306 

of Salmonella contamination in fresh chicken meat sold in wet markets.  

307 

  We found that S. Saintpaul, S. Brancaster, S. Albany, and S. Stanley represented up to 

308 

75% of all the isolates in fresh chicken meat from wet markets and supermarkets. The 

309 

most prevalent serovar from raw chicken vary widely across studies: S. Corvallis and S. 

310 

Albany in Vietnam (Nguyen, et al., 2016; Ta, et al., 2014) and S. Enteritidis in Egypt and 

311 

China (Abd-Elghany, et al., 2015; Li, Zhou, & Miao, 2017), suggesting geography-

312 

dependent prevalence pattern of serovars. Based on Singapore’s Ministry of Health’s 

313 

epidemiological reports, the top four serovars in this study are attributed to approximately 

314 

10% of human salmonellosis cases in Singapore (MOH, 2015). On the other hand, 

315 

Salmonella Enteritidis, the most commonly reported serovar responsible for human 

316 

salmonellosis cases in the last decade in Singapore (Kondakci & Yuk, 2012), was not 

317 

detected in our cross-sectional study. This suggests that fresh chicken meat may not play 

318 

a major role in the epidemiology of salmonellosis due to S. Enteritidis in Singapore. 

319 

Further studies involving other food items such as eggs may be needed to explain the 

320 

observation. Alternatively, due to the detection limit of the culture method (1 CFU/25 g 

321 

or 0.04 CFU/g), any S. Enteritidis cells present in the fresh raw chicken below the 

322 

detection method may not be isolated but still might cause disease due to its higher 

323 

virulence (Teunis, et al., 2010).  

 

15 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT324 

 

In this study, we successfully used multilocus sequence typing (MLST) as an 

325 

alternative method to the conventional serotyping scheme of Salmonella isolates as 

326 

suggested by (Achtman, et al., 2012). This addressed the high cost needed to maintain a 

327 

large collection of ‘O’ and ‘H’ Salmonella antigens required in serotyping a wide array of 

328 

common and rare serovars alike. Although effective as a serotyping tool, the 

329 

determination of phylogeny using MLST may have some limitations in discriminating 

330 

power, due to the relatively low variable nature of the seven housekeeping genes. In our 

331 

study, apart from S. Albany which was isolated in the form of two different sequence 

332 

types (STs), for all other isolates, only one ST each was found for each serovar. In the 

333 

dendrograms based on MLST, isolates with identical STs are clustered together and no 

334 

further genotypic discrimination is possible even though they may be isolated from 

335 

different sources, market types and time period. An alternative genotyping method with a 

336 

higher resolution, such as whole genome sequencing (WGS) followed by the construction 

337 

of phylogenetic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) tree may help to determine the 

338 

genetic relationship between isolates of the same serovar from different sources as 

339 

previously demonstrated by Leekitcharoenphon, Nielsen, Kaas, Lund, and Aarestrup 

340 

(2014) and Holt, et al. (2010).  Nevertheless, isolates displaying different STs such as S. 

341 

Albany (ST292 and ST3633) in this study appeared to be genetically different and hence 

342 

can be discriminated based on MLST.   

343 

  We detected multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella in 59.6% (31/52) of the isolates 

344 

obtained from fresh chicken meat sold in local wet markets and supermarkets. The most 

345 

common phenotypic resistance pattern among MDR isolates was AMP-C-SXT-TE. 

346 

Previous studies reported similar phenotypes in Salmonella isolates from food-producing 

 

16 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT347 

animals in Vietnam (Lettini, et al., 2016; Nguyen, et al., 2016; Ta, et al., 2014; Thai, 

348 

Hirai, Lan, & Yamaguchi, 2012; Thai & Yamaguchi, 2012; Tu, et al., 2015), Mexico 

349 

(Miranda, et al., 2009) and Thailand (Pulsrikarn, et al., 2012). The use of penicillin, 

350 

sulfonamides and tetracycline as primary treatment of various bacterial diseases in 

351 

poultry (Mathew, Cissell, & Liamthong, 2007; Singer & Hofacre, 2006) might have 

352 

contributed to the emergence of this phenotype as the dominant resistance pattern. 

353 

Considering the high rates of resistance towards these antibiotics found in this study and 

354 

several others, strict regulation and extensive education in the use of these drugs in 

355 

agriculture as well as in human and veterinary medicine should be implemented. This 

356 

will serve to prevent further emergence of resistance that could seriously limit their 

357 

usefulness in the near future. 

358 

 

To understand the genetic basis of resistance towards quinolone and fluoroquinolone 

359 

which are of clinical importance in the treatment of invasive salmonellosis (Acheson & 

360 

Hohmann, 2001), the presence of mutations of gyrA and parC in the QRDR were 

361 

assessed. There are several known mechanisms of resistance towards quinolones and 

362 

fluoroquinolones: target gene mutations, active efflux pumps, a decreased outer 

363 

membrane permeability and plasmid-mediated resistance genes (Hooper, 2001; Jacoby, 

364 

2005; Ruiz, 2003; Zgurskaya & Nikaido, 2000). In this study, we investigated the 

365 

stepwise mutations between alternating gene targets gyrA and parC (Hooper, 2001). We 

366 

found that S. Give (WB11) and S. Albany (WB2) isolates carried a single mutation in the 

367 

primary target (gyrA) but not in the secondary target (parC) despite exhibiting phenotypic 

368 

resistance to both nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin (Table 5). This was not in agreement 

369 

with the findings of Šeputienė, et al. (2006) who reported that a first mutation in gyrA 

 

17 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT370 

gene conferred only nalidixic acid resistance while a second mutation in parC was 

371 

needed before developing ciprofloxacin resistance in Gram-negative bacteria. 

372 

Unexpected ciprofloxacin resistance in S. Give (WB11) and S. Albany (WB2) isolates in 

373 

this study in addition to the predicted resistance to nalidixic acid suggests the presence of 

374 

other resistance mechanisms synergistically at work with the gyrA mutation. 

375 

Furthermore, nalidixic acid resistance displayed by S. Stanley and S. Brancaster isolates 

376 

despite lack of any mutations in gyrA and parC genes also suggests the presence of other 

377 

resistance mechanisms such as the plasmid-borne qnr resistance genes. An investigation 

378 

of the presence of qnr genes should be carried out in these isolates next to further 

379 

establish a complete picture of quinolone resistance in these isolates.  

380 

 

381 

5.  Conclusion 

382 

383 

 

This is the first report from Singapore that determines the prevalence and antibiotic 

384 

resistance patterns of Salmonella isolated from retail fresh chicken meat. Significantly 

385 

higher prevalence of Salmonella contamination was found in chicken meat from the wet 

386 

markets than those from supermarkets, suggesting that the degree of Salmonella 

387 

contamination might be market type-dependent. Of the 52 Salmonella isolates, 59.6% 

388 

were multidrug resistant that exhibited high resistance rates towards ampicillin, 

389 

chloramphenicol, tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. Two different 

390 

mutations in gyrA, but no parC mutation, were found in quinolone-resistant Salmonella 

391 

isolates. The data provide opportunities for risk assessment and management of 

392 

antibiotic-resistant Salmonella in the country and the region.
