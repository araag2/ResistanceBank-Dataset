Abstract Reports of livestock infections with extended-
spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-
E) are increasing. Based on interviews conducted over a 6-
month period, we found that veterinarians in the Vietnamese
province of Thai Binh prefer to prescribe colistin-based drugs
(CBD) in chicken farms. We aimed to clarify whether CBD
use selects for strains of colistin-resistant ESBL-E. With the
cooperation of seven local households, we detected ESBL-E
in chickens’ feces after treating chickens with CBD.
Phylogenetic groupings and the presence of CTX-M/AmpC
genes were determined, and the multi-antibiotic susceptibility
of isolates was analyzed. Our results showed that ESBL-E
presented in seven chickens’ feces from two households.
Seventy-two percent of ESBL-E isolates harbored CTX-M9
and the phylogenetic group A; the colistin minimum inhibito-
ry concentration (MIC) of all isolated ESBL-E ranged from
−1. Moreover, ESBL-E isolates were used to
0.064 to 1 μg mL
experimentally select for colistin resistance, and the effect of
commercial CBD on ESBL-E was investigated. The results
showed that an ESBL-E strain with a colistin MIC of
−1 was able to grow in media with CBD. Although
4 μg mL
CBD treatment was effective, in vitro experiments demon-
strated that ESBL-E can easily acquire colistin resistance.
Therefore, restrictions on colistin use are necessary to prevent
the emergence of colistin-resistant bacteria.

Introduction

The expansion of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a serious prob-
lem worldwide (Shah et al. 2004). Reports of infections
caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing
Escherichia coli (ESBL-E) and AmpC beta-lactamase-
producing E. coli have recently increased in developing coun-
tries (Sasaki et al. 2010; Nakayama et al. 2015). Thus, tech-
niques to inhibit the spread of ESBL-E are urgently needed.
Colistin, which was discovered in 1950, is used as an antibi-
otic, particularly for the elimination of gram-negative bacteria
(Koike and Iida 1971). However, colistin use has some side
effects and safety problems (Krajewski et al. 2014). Thus, this
compound is rarely used in Japan. Nevertheless, as multidrug
resistant (MDR) bacteria continue to emerge, the use of colis-
tin is being reconsidered in order to eliminate gram-negative
MDR bacteria, including ESBL-E (Bargiacchi et al. 2014;
Martis et al. 2014; Froelich et al. 2006).

Colistin has shown in vitro activity against E. coli,
Klebsiella pneumoniae, andEnterobacter cloacae , suggesting
that colistin is active against most ESBL-producing
Enterobacteriaceae (Ku et al. 2015). Experimental colistin
treatments on human clinical isolates have shown that any
ESBL-E harboring CTX-M-1, -2, and -9, and TEM/SHV is
susceptible to colistin (Nakamura et al. 2014). Another study
indicated that a regimen of colistin and neomycin temporarily
suppressed the intestinal carriage of ESBL-E, without any
long-term effects (Huttner et al. 2013). These findings suggest
that colistin-based drug (CBD) treatment might be effective in
eliminating ESBL-E. However, additional studies on colistin

treatment of livestock and the possible emergence of colistin-
resistant bacteria are needed.

There are several reports on the mechanism of colistin re-
sistance (Quesada et al. 2015; Suzuki et al. 2016). The genes
pmr (polymyxin resistance) A and pmrB encode a two-
component system, with a sensor histidine kinase and its cog-
nate regulator, which activates the pmr genes. Colistin resis-
tance in Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Acinetobacter baumannii, and E. coli is associated with
pmrA and pmrB mutants with upregulated expression of pmr
genes (Quesada et al. 2015). Liu et al. reported the first
plasmid-mediated polymixin resistance gene, mcr-1, in
Enterobacteriaceae isolated from humans, food, and animals
in China (Liu et al. 2015). The plasmid-mediated mcr-1 gene
may facilitate interspecies transfer. Thus, dissemination of the
plasmid-mediated mcr-1 gene should be monitored.

In our previous study, we investigated food contamina-
tion with ESBL-E at a Vietnamese market. The results
showed that chicken was the most commonly ESBL-E-
contaminated meat, compared to beef, pork, and shrimp
(Phong et al. 2015). Antibiotic residues in chicken were
also investigated, and the results showed that chicken in
the Vietnamese market contained high concentrations of
antibiotic residues (Yamaguchi et al. 2015). Nhung et al.
(2015) noted that Vietnamese chicken farms in the
Mekong Delta have abused antibiotics. Local farmers in
Vietnam give their chickens feed mixed with growth pro-
moters and antibiotics, which local veterinarians prescribe
for livestock growth. Vietnam does not carefully regulate
antibiotic use, including colistin, for livestock manage-
ment. Generally, local veterinarians determine which
drugs should be used for livestock in their communities.
Although there have been no reports of colistin-resistant
bacteria in Vietnam thus far, colistin drug abuse could
cause such resistant bacteria to develop. During a prelim-
inary survey, we isolated ESBL-E, including a strain with
intermediate susceptibility to colistin, from chickens
raised on three backyard farms in Nguyen Xa, Thai Bin.
It is unclear whether the treatment of chickens with anti-
biotics promoted the emergence of colistin-resistant bac-
teria. The aim of this study was to clarify whether
colistin-resistant ESBL-E emerge after CBD treatment of
chickens raised on backyard farms.

Materials and methods

Bacterial sampling

Chicken fecal samples were collected in December 2013
and March 2014. A total of 30 chicken feces were
sampled from 7 local households, with 3 to 9 chickens
in each backyard, in Thai Binh Province, Vietnam. After

the chicks were shipped from the hatchery to the local
farmer’s backyard, they were given free access to CBD-
treated drinking water for 1 week. CBD-treated drinking
water was made with a total of 5 g of a commercial CBD
product, BM-COLI-PLUM (Binh Minh, Hanoi, Vietnam),
added to 1 L of tap water.

After this initial treatment week, the chickens were bred for
40 days without exposure to CBD. At the end of this breeding
period, the chickens’ feces were sampled using swabs with
Cary-Blair transport media (Eiken Chemical, Tokyo, Japan).
We isolated ESBL-E from a local market in Thai Binh and
used the original ESBL-E isolated from household A as our
reference strains. These isolates were compared with the
ESBL-E that we isolated from feces after chickens were treat-
ed with colistin.

Isolation, identification, and confirmation of ESBL

Our procedure to isolate and confirm any ESBL-E follow-
ed that of Nakayama et al. (2015). ESBL-E was confirmed
with the combination disk method, which is based on the
inhibitory effects of clavulanic acid. Fecal samples were
cultured in CHROMagar (CHROMagar, Paris, France)
−1 of cefotaxime (CTX).
and supplemented with 1 μg mL
Between one and three blue colonies were tested in triple
sugar-iron (Japan BD, Tokyo, Japan), motility-indole-
lysine (Japan BD, Tokyo, Japan), and cellobiose–lactose–
indole–β-D-glucuronidase (Kyokuto Pharmaceutical
Industrial Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) media. Our observa-
tions of these cultures matched the biochemical character-
istics of E. coli reported in the Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute criteria (Phong et al. 2015). The perfor-
mance standards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing
were obtained from the 16th informational supplement,
M100–S16 (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute,
Wayne, PA, USA).

Antibiotic susceptibility test

The antibiotic susceptibility test for ESBL-E was performed
with the disk diffusion method, following the performance
standards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (M100-S23)
established by CLSI. We tested susceptibility of strains to
ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, kanamycin, chloram-
phenicol, gentamicin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol, cipro-
floxacin, nalidic acid, fosfomycin, meropeneme, cefoxitin,
ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime/clavulanic acid,
cefotaxime/clavulanic acid, and colistin using sensi-discs
(Japan BD, Tokyo, Japan). The colistin minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) was also measured using a colistin E-test
(Sysmex Biomerieux, Paris, France).

Detection of ESBL-related genes and phylogenetic
markers

For DNA extraction, each colony was suspended in 100 μL of
tris-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid buffer and boiled for
10 min. The DNA was stored at −20 °C until further use.
ESBL genes were screened with a multiplex polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) method that simultaneously detects CTX-M,
TEM, and SHV genes. The primer sets that were used are
shown in Table 1. PCR amplifications were performed using
a QIAGEN Multiplex PCR Plus Kit (QIAGEN GmbH,
Hilden, Germany), with a PCR program that consisted of an
initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 25
cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The
phylogenetic analysis was conducted according to methods
outlined in Clermont et al. (2000). PCR amplifications were
performed using EX Taq kits (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan);
the program consisted of an initial denaturation step at 98 °C
for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles at 98 °C for 10 s, 57 °C for
30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The primer sets that were used are
shown in Table 1.

Development of colistin resistance

Two strains of E. coli (TB1 and TB133) were used for the
experimental development of colistin resistance. For E. coli
−1; for E. coli TB133,
TB1, the colistin MIC was 0.064 μg mL
−1. After subculturing, 5 μL of
the colistin MIC was 3 μg mL
TB1 or TB133 was used to begin cultures in 5 mL of LB
−1 of colistin sulfate (Sigma-
medium with 0.1 or 0.5 μg mL
Aldrich, St. Luis, USA). All bacteria were cultured at 37 °C

Table 1

Primers used in this study

for 24 h, with shaking at 140 rotations per minute. After cul-
turing for 24 h, the bacterial broth was assessed by obtaining
the optical density at 600 nm. If the optical density was greater
than 0.6, 5 μL of the broth was subcultured in 5 mL of LB
−1 of colistin. TB1 and TB133 gradually
medium and 1 μg mL
developed colistin resistance. The resulting bacteria were
evaluated for colistin resistance using a colistin sensi-disc
and a colistin MIC E-test. Moreover, the growth of colistin-
resistant bacteria was evaluated in LB medium with a com-
mercial CBD product named BM-COLI-PLUM (Binh Minh,
Hanoi, Vietnam). The CBD concentration was adjusted to
−1, which is a typical concentration used by local farmers.
5 g L
After subculturing the bacteria, 5 mL of the bacterial broth
was added to LB medium containing CBD. Bacterial growth
was measured at an optical density of 600 nm after 24 h.

Fig. 1 Investigation reveals that
local farmers prefer to purchase
CBD. Interviews were conducted
in Nguen Xa community, Thai
Binh, Vietnam, in 2014, from
April to October. a Eleven-
hundred and six local farmers
purchased veterinary drugs for
6 months, and more than 50 % of
local farmers selected CBD.
Statistical analysis showed a
significant difference between
CBD and the other drugs. b Drug-
purchasing data were used to
model the number of chickens
exposed to each antibiotic. CBD
was purchased in the greatest
quantity, and the other drugs were
purchased for less than 7000
chickens

screening with CTX showed that 7 of the 30 chicken fecal
samples were infected with CTX-resistant E. coli, and all 7
of those infected samples came from 2 (household B and E) of
the 7 households surveyed (Table 2). CTX-resistant E. coli
was selected for further study. One single colony was isolated
from one chicken in household B, while 18 colonies were
isolated from 6 chickens in household E.

Characteristics of ESBL or AmpC-producing bacterial
isolates

In total, 23 of the strains that we isolated were CTX-resistant
E. coli. These isolates were investigated for ESBL production.
The results showed that 82.6 % (19/23) of the CTX-resistant
E. coli were ESBL-producers and 17.4 % (4/23) of the CTX-

resistant E. coli were AmpC beta-lactamase-producers
(Table 3). We tested the susceptibility of the strains to 15
antibiotics and determined that the 23 CTX-resistant E. coli
that we isolated were MDR (Table 3). Specifically, they ex-
hibited antibiotic resistance against ampicillin, tetracycline,
chloramphenicol, and nalidic acid (Table 3). The ESBL-E
isolated were also investigated for colistin susceptibility. The
results showed that no strains of ESBL-E exhibited colistin
resistance.

In addition, the presence of antibiotic-resistant genes was
also assessed, and CTX-M9 was identified in 100 % (19/19)
of the ESBL-E isolates, while TEM was identified in 68.4 %
(13/19) of the ESBL-E isolates (Table 3). Their phylogenetic
groupings were determined, and 69.6 % of the strains (16/23)
were identified as group A (Table 3).

Development of colistin resistance

In this study, a commercial CBD used to eliminate ESBL-E
was associated with several levels of colistin resistance.
Although the ESBL-E isolate from chicken feces was unable
to grow, an experimentally developed colistin-resistant ESBL-
E was able to grow. Both TB1 and TB133 gradually devel-
oped colistin resistance after exposure to various concentra-
tions of colistin. Finally, both strains were able to grow in
−1 of colistin, and TB1 and TB133 showed colistin
100 μg mL
−1, respectively. A colistin sensi-
MICs of 24 and 64 μg mL

disc was also used, and results showed that colistin displayed
inhibition zones of less than 5 cm for both TB1 and TB133
(Fig. 2).

Discussion

In the community of Nguyen Xa, Thai Bin Province, farmers
are accustomed to administering antibiotics to their chicks
soon after they have arrived from the hatchery. Local veteri-
narians believe that the chicks’ immature immune systems
make them susceptible to infection by pathogenic bacteria.
Therefore, the use of antibiotics has become a common strat-
egy for maintaining chicks’ health. We found that more than
50 % of backyard farmers preferred to purchase CBD, rather
than other antibiotics, in quantity (Fig. 1a, b).

During our preliminary survey, the ESBL-E that we isolat-
ed from backyard chickens showed intermediate colistin sus-
ceptibility (Table 3). CBD are important antibiotics for the
elimination of MDR gram-negative bacteria, including
ESBL-E. Therefore, we investigated chicken fecal samples
after CBD treatment.

This study showed that a total of 7 of those infected
samples came from 2 (household B and E) of the 7 house-
holds surveyed (Table 2). Multiple colonies were detected
from all 6 chickens in household E, and ESBL-E was
eliminated by CBD in almost all chickens except second

Table 3 Antibiotic susceptibility of CTX-resistant bacteria isolated from chicken feces

Trop Anim Health Prod

The isolated ESBL-E strains were also investigated for co-
listin susceptibility. The results showed that no strains of
ESBL-E exhibited colistin resistance. Nevertheless, positive
results from 6 chickens in one household suggested that the
chickens were re-infected with ESBL-E after CBD treatment,
and that the ESBL-E readily underwent clonal expansion in
that particular household.

We determined that the 19 CTX-resistant E. coli that we
isolated were MDR. The number of antibiotics against which
these isolates were resistant ranged from 7 to 9. Three reference
ESBL-E isolated from a local market were compared with the
19 strains obtained from the infected chickens. The reference
strains were resistant to only 6 antibiotics, whereas those from
household E were resistant to 9. Although statistical analysis
revealed no significant difference in the β-lactam resistances
between strains isolated from backyards and markets, strains
from backyards exhibited resistance to aminoglycoside, quino-
lone, and other antibiotics (Table 3). These results suggest that
β-lactam-resistant bacteria are widespread in the Thai Binh
area, whereas the prevalence of aminoglycoside- and
quinolone-resistant bacteria is limited to households. This con-
trast suggests that chickens raised in backyard farms in Nguyen
Xa have a considerably higher level of antibiotic resistance than
chickens across Thai Binh. Thus, the use of veterinarian-
prescribed CBD as a prophylactic in chickens has increased
the prevalence of MDR bacteria in backyard farms.

In this study, commercial CBD was used to eliminate
ESBL-E with several levels of colistin resistance. Colistin-
resistant bacteria are, at present, restricted to backyards farms
in Nguyen Xa. If local farmers continue to use CBD, the
prevalence of colistin-resistant bacteria may increase.

In conclusion, our research reveals that more than 50 %
of drugs purchased by local farmers in Nguyen Xa, Thai
Binh Province, are CBD. In the 40 days following the
1 week of CBD treatment, all of the chickens survived
and remained healthy. ESBL-E was detected in only 2
households. Moreover, the ESBL-E that we did isolate
from the remaining households did not exhibit colistin
resistance, suggesting that the backyard chickens were
re-infected with ESBL-E after CBD treatment. CBD is
an important antibiotic; however, its use should be limit-
ed, even when it is effective. We have yet to identify the
emergence of colistin-resistant bacteria; however, Vietnam
does not have rigorous regulations for antibiotic use in
livestock. We urgently advise researchers, policymakers,
regulators, farmers, and chemical manufacturers to devel-
op and enforce appropriate and effective rules to prevent
the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.

Fig. 2 Limitation of the commercial CBD eliminates ESBL-producing
E. coli. Both TB1 and TB133 strains developed colistin antibiotic
resistance. Both strains were able to grow under 0.5, 1.0, 8.0, 12.0,
−1 colistin concentration. Each bacterial
28.0, 40.0, 60.0, and 100 μg mL
culture was evaluated using a disk diffusion test, measurement of optical
density, and a colistin MIC assay

trial in household E. This suggested that CBD is effective
in eliminating ESBL-E.

The presence of antibiotic-resistant genes was investigated,
and CTX-M9 was identified in 83.3 % (15/18) of the ESBL-E
isolates in household E. The phylogenetic groupings were also
determined, and 72.2 % (13/18) of the isolates were identified
as group A. These results suggested that ESBL-E harbored
CTX-M-9 and phylogenetic A group might be clonal expan-
sion in household E.

In another preliminary study, CTX-M9-bearing and
phylogenetic group A strains were often found in food
samples (chicken, pork, beef, fish, and shrimp) in
Vietnam (Phong et al. 2015). We noticed the same ten-
dency in chicken feces as in food samples, suggesting that
the patterns of ESBL-E in chicken feces can be general-
ized to food samples.
