Abstract Antimicrobial susceptibility test of 98 iso-
lates of Salmonella was assayed from September
2003 to February 2004 using the guidelines of the
National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Stan-
dards (NCCLS).The result revealed that 32.7% of
Salmonella isolates were resistant to one or more of
the 24 antimicrobials tested. Generally resistance for
13 different antimicrobial drugs was recognized. The
most common resistance was to streptomycin (24/32,
75%), ampicillin (19/32, 59.4%), tetracycline (15/32,
46.9%), spectinomycin (13/32, 40.6%) and sulfisox-
azole (13/32, 40.6%). All
the three Salmonella
Kentucky isolates showed resistance to at
least
8 antimicrobials. Out of the 12 Salmonella Braen-
derup isolates, 10 (83.3%) showed multidrug resis-
tance to ampicillin, spectinomycin, streptomycin,
sulfisoxazole, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, amox-
icillin/clavulanic acid and trimethoprim. Among the
8 S. Hadar isolates 7 (86.5%) showed antimicrobial
resistance. All the 6 S. Dublin isolates were resistant

to carbadox (100%). All the 6 S. Haifa isolates were
resistant for at
least ampicillin, streptomycin and
tetracycline. Up to ten different antimicrobial resis-
tances pattern was observed. Multiple antimicrobial
drug resistance was observed in 23 Salmonella
isolates (23.5%). The level of antimicrobial resistance
was significantly higher for isolates from chicken
carcass (18/29, 62.1%) and pork isolates (5/22,
22.7%) (p=0.003). The findings of the present study
ascertain that significant proportion Salmonella iso-
lates have developed resistance for routinely pre-
scribed antimicrobial drugs and poses considerable
health hazards to the consumers unless prudent
control measures are instituted.

Introduction

Antimicrobial-resistant salmonellae are increasing due
to the use of antimicrobial agents in food animals, which
are subsequently transmitted to humans usually through
the food supply (White et al. 2001; Angulo et al. 2000;
Fey et al. 2000; Mølback et al. 1999; Tollefson et al.
1998; D’Aoust 1989). Routine assessment of patterns
of emerging antibiotic resistant Salmonella strains is of
paramount importance because such information chan-
neled to physicians and veterinarians help to timely

redirect drug use so as to diminish the development
and spread of resistance (Tellefson et al. 1998).

As serovars and phage types and, with them,
antibiotic sensitivity patterns can vary annually (Van
Duijkeren et al. 1994b); the choice of the drug for
treatment of salmonellosis should always be based on
sensitivity testing of the causative strain. However,
since it takes two or three days before the result is
available, blind therapy has to be started in severely
ill animals. Therefore, susceptibility testing combined
with knowledge of the pharmacokinetic and toxico-
logic data of the drug are essential in choosing an
effective drug for antimicrobial therapy (Prescott and
Baggot 1993).

The strains of S. Typhimurium known as definitive
phage type 104 (DT 104) have become a worldwide
health problem causing illness in humans and ani-
mals. It is usually resistant to five drugs: ampicillin,
chloramphinicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and
tetracyclines (White et al. 2001; Hohmann 2001;
Lesser and Miller 2001; Cloeckaert et al. 2000;
Mølback et al. 1999; Tellefson et al. 1998; Glynn et
al. 1998). A report from the United Kingdom suggests
that infections caused by this five-drug-resistant S.
Typhimurium might be associated with greater mor-
bidity and mortality than other Salmonella infections
(Lesser and Miller 2001; Wall et al. 1994).

The emerging resistance in Salmonella is largely a
consequence of the use of antimicrobial agents in
animals (Acha and Szyfres 2001; Hohmann 2001;
Olsen et al. 2001; Gorbach 2001) as well as the
indiscriminate prescription-drug treatment of people
and animals (Acha and Szyfres 2001). Resistance in
Salmonella raise health care costs (Gorbach 2001)
and limits the therapeutic options available to veter-
inarians and physicians in the treatment of certain
cases of salmonellosis (Witte 1998).

In recent years, testing of Salmonella isolates has
shown that an increasing proportion of isolates are
resistant
to several antimicrobial agents both in
developing and developed countries. The issue of
antimicrobial resistance is more complex in developing
countries (Leegaard et al. 1996) like Ethiopia where
Salmonella is not routinely isolated and resistance to
commonly used antimicrobial drugs in veterinary and
public health sector not regularly assessed. Therefore,
the present study, which was a part of cross-sectional
study of Salmonella from supermarket food items and

personnel, was undertaken to investigate the suscepti-
bility of Salmonella isolates to commonly used
antimicrobial agents in Ethiopia for the treatment of
bacterial diseases including salmonellosis.

Materials and methods

Isolation of salmonellae

A total of 1200 food samples i.e. chicken meat (208),
pork (194), minced beef (142), mutton (212), cottage
cheese (190), fish (128) and ice cream (126) and 68
stool samples collected from retail supermarkets, open
markets and shops in Addis Ababa were examined for
detection of Salmonella using the technique recom-
mended by the International Organization for Stan-
dardization (ISO 1998) during the period from
September 2003 to February 2004. Salmonella isola-
tion was successful from all samples except
ice
cream. Ninety-eight Salmonella isolates identified
into fourteen different serotypes were employed for
the purpose of this study.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

The antimicrobial susceptibility test of all isolates of
Salmonella was assayed in the Food Microbiology
Laboratory, Laboratory Service Division, Animal
Health Laboratory, University of Guelph, Guelph,
Ontario; Canada. The National Committee for Clinical
Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) (1999) guidelines was
followed throughout the agar dilution testing procedure
and interpretation of results as susceptible and resistant.
Briefly, the isolates were grown to 0.5 – 1.0 McFarland
density in Muller Hilton (MH) broth (Difco, Detroit,
USA) and replica plated using a Cathra Replicator
(Brown and Washington 1978) on to MH agar plates
(Difco, Detroit, USA). The list of panel of antimicro-
bials utilized,
their symbols and concentrations to
classify an isolate as susceptible or resistant were
shown on Table 1. An isolate was defined as resistant
if it was resistant to one or more of the antimicrobial
drugs tested whereas multiple resistance was defined as
resistance to two or more antimicrobial drugs. Standard
and reference strains were used following the recom-
mendations of NCCLS (1999).

Fisher’s exact test was used to see the significance
of antimicrobial resistance between food items. A
difference will be statistically significant if the P-value
is less than 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed
using Intercooled Stata 6.0 soft ware package.

Results

Of the 98 Salmonella serotypes subjected to antimicro-
bial susceptibility test, using a panel of 24 different
antimicrobials (Table 1), 32 serotypes (32.7%) were

244

found resistant to one or more of the antimicrobials
used. A total of 66 (67.3%) Salmonella isolates
belonging to S. Newport, S. Typhimurium, S. Infantis,
S. Bovismorbificans, S. Anatum, S. Zanzibar, S.
Kottbus, S. Saintpaul and S. I: 9, 12:- were found to
be susceptible to all antimicrobials tested. However, 32
Salmonella isolates (32.7%) belonging to S. Braen-
derup, S. Hadar, S. Dublin, S. Haifa and S. Kentucky
were resistant to one or more of the 24 antimicrobials
tested (Tables 2 and 3). All Salmonella isolates
belonging to S. Dublin (isolated from pork, mutton
and minced beef) were resistant to carbadox and S.
Haifa (isolated from pork and cottage cheese) were
resistant to ampicillin, streptomycin and tetracycline.
About 83% of S. Braenderup isolated from chicken

carcass and 87.5% of S. Hadar isolated from chicken
carcass and mutton were also resistant to one or more of
the antimicrobials tested.
In relation to the total
Salmonella isolates tested, 24.5% were found resistant
to streptomycin, while 19.4%, 15.3%, 13.3% and 13.3%
were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, spectinomycin
and sulfisoxazole, respectively.

With regards to source of the 32 resistant Salmo-
nella isolates, chicken carcass accounted for 56.3%
(18/32) while pork, mutton, minced beef and cottage
cheese accounted for 21.9% (7/32), 9.4% (3/32),
9.4% (3/32) and 3.1% (1/32), respectively. Among
Salmonella isolates from chicken carcass and pork
samples 62.1% and 31.8% were resistant for one or
more antimicrobials tested (Table 6). All Salmonella

between sample types being highest
in chicken
carcass (65.2%, 15/23), cottage cheese (25%, 1/4)
and pork 21.7%, 5/23). It is lowest in minced beef
(8.3%, 1/12) and mutton (4.3%, 1/23) samples.
Among MDR isolates resistance to streptomycin,
spectinomycin, sulfisoxazole, ampicillin and tetracy-
cline was most often observed (Table 5).

Serotypes isolated from chicken carcass (S. Brae-
derup and S. Kentucky) showed resistance pattern for
up to ten antimicrobials, while those isolates from pork
(S. Haifa) showed resistance pattern for up to four
antimicrobials. None of the mutton and cottage cheese
isolates showed resistance for more than three anti-
microbials and only one serotype from minced beef
showed resistance for 8 antimicrobials. The most
frequent combination of resistance was seen in S.
Braenderup for the following antimicrobials: ampicil-
lin, spectinomycin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, sulfa-
methoxazole/trimethoprim and trimethoprim. The three
S. Kentucky serotypes isolated from exotic chicken
carcass (one), local chicken carcass (one) and minced
beef (one) samples were found to have MDR pattern
for 10, 9 and 8 antimicrobials, respectively. Although
12 different antimicrobial resistance patterns were seen
in this study, the two most common resistance patterns
were Amp Spt Str Sul Sxt Tmp (9 isolates from
chicken) and Amp Amc Str Tet (4 isolates from pork).
Resistance to trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole/
trimethoprim was seen only in S. Braenderup and S.
Kentucky isolated from chicken carcass while to

Looking at individual antimicrobial drug, resistance to
streptomycin was most frequently observed, followed by
ampicillin, tetracycline, spectinomycin, and sulfisoxazole
(Table 5). Isolates resistant to these antimicrobials were
detected predominantly from chicken carcass and pork.

Discussion

Antimicrobial resistance recognizes no geographical
boundaries and increasing rate of
resistance of
Salmonella isolates have been reported from devel-
oping and developed countries. Some of the antimi-
crobial drugs for which Salmonella serotypes/
serogroups were resistant
in our study have been
reported earlier from Ethiopia (Molla et al. 2003;
Alemayehu et al. 2004; Tibaijuka et al. 2003; Mache
2002; Molla et al. 1999b; Mache et al. 1997; Ashenafi
and Gedebou 1985; Gedebou and Tassew 1981),
other African countries (Leegaard et al. 1996;
Adesiyun and Oni 1989; Hadfield and Monson
1985; Hummel 1979) and elsewhere (White et al.
2001; Gebreyes et al. 2000; Tellefson et al. 1998; Lee
et al. 1993; D’Aoust et al. 1992).

The finding of 32.7% antimicrobial

resistant
Salmonella isolates from food samples examined
was remarkable. It represents public health hazards
due to the fact that food poisoning outbreaks would

be difficult
to treat and this pool of multi-drug
resistant Salmonella in food supply represents a
reservoir for transferable resistant genes (Diaz De
Aguayo et al. 1992).

Among the important findings of the antimicrobial
resistance testing was that 62.1% (18/29) of chicken
carcass, 31.8% (7/22) of pork, 25% (1/4) of cottage
cheese, 13% (3/23) of mutton and none of the fish and
human isolates were antimicrobial resistant (Table 2).
The level of resistance was significantly higher for
chicken carcass and pork isolates (p=0.003) (Table 6).
Tibaijuka et al. (2003) also reported 60% antimicrobial
drug resistance from chicken meat, which was similar
to our findings. D’Aoust et al. (1992) also indicated a
high antimicrobial resistance among poultry isolates as
compared to Salmonella isolated from other sources.
Out of the 32 resistant isolates 24 (75%), 19 (59.4%)
and 15 (46.9%) were resistant
for streptomycin,
ampicillin and tetracycline, respectively (Table 5).
The significantly high frequency of resistant salmonel-
lae for these antimicrobials was probably an indication
of their frequent usage both in livestock and public
health sectors. The high prevalence of Salmonella
isolates resistant to some of these relatively cheaper
and commonly available antimicrobials is disturbing
because of the limited access and high cost of newer
cephalosporins and quinolone drugs (D’Aoust 1989)
for poor citizens of developing countries like Ethiopia.
Furthermore, systemic spread of such resistant isolates
in human host could lead to serious complications or to
a fatal outcome (D’Aoust 1991).

Our antimicrobial drug resistance result indicated that
resistance to some extended spectrum cephalosporins
(ceftriaxone, ceftiofur), aminoglycosides and newer
quinolones was absent, perhaps due to their limited

usage in veterinary and public health sectors of Ethiopia.
On the other hand the occurrence of resistance to the
quinolone (nalidic acid) and fluoroquinolone (ciproflox-
acin) in 9.4% of resistant isolates from chicken carcass
and minced beef or 3.1% of the total Salmonella isolates
(S. Kentucky) was striking because development of
resistance undermines the value of this first line drug
(ciprofloxacin)
for human systemic salmonellosis.
Reasons for the emergence of resistance against these
drugs were unknown and deserve investigation. How-
ever, introduction of resistant Salmonella with impor-
tation of food items and travelers was suspected
(D’Aoust 1994). MDR was higher in Salmonella
isolates from chicken carcass and pork. Thus, 65.2%
of MDR isolates were S. Braenderup, S. Hadar and S.
Kentucky from chicken carcass and 21.7% of MDR
isolates from pork were S. Haifa. These all show that
antimicrobial resistant Salmonella serotypes are wide-
spread and more common particularly from chicken
carcass, cottage cheese and pork samples as compared
to mutton and minced beef. The isolation of susceptible
S. Newport among supermarket butchery workers and
food items examined indicate that
the source of
contamination could be either from reservoir animals
or personnel. The reasons for the recovery of antimi-
crobial resistant Salmonella serotypes was most likely
due to the indiscriminate use of antimicrobials (Guthrie
1992; WHO 1988), self-medication due to easy access
to antibiotics without prescription (Acha and Szyfres
2001) in public health sector and the administration of
sub-therapeutic dose of antimicrobials to livestock for
prophylactic or nutritional purpose. Such agricultural
practices introduce selective pressures that potentiate
the emergence and distribution of resistant salmonellae
in meats and other products (D’Aoust 1989). There-
fore, attempts should be made to reduce the magnitude
of the problem at various levels through prudent use of
antimicrobials. The tendency of salmonellae for intra-
and inter-generic exchange of cytoplasmic DNA (R
plasmid) that encodes for single or multiple antimicro-
bial resistances is another contributing factor (D’Aoust
et al. 1992; D’Aoust 1989, 1991; WHO 1988).
Nonetheless, there is a need to relate the type and
amount of antimicrobial drugs used in intensive farms
with data from systematic survey of resistant Salmo-
nella infection to monitor changing resistance and to
determine if change in the frequency and pattern of
resistance are related to specific pattern of antimicrobial
usage (Lee et al. 1993).

None of the S. Typhimurium isolates were found
resistant to any of the antimicrobial drugs used. In
contrast, Alemayehu et al. (2004) detected MDR
strain of S. Typhimurium phage type 2 and Molla et
al. (1999b) reported 60% of S. Typhimurium isolates
from chicken and minced beef to be MDR. Leegaard
et al. (1996) also reported MDR S. Typhimurium. The
absence of antimicrobial resistant Salmonella isolates
from minced beef in Nyeleti et al. (2000) and 25% (3/
12) resistant isolates in the present investigation was
contrasting and suggests that antimicrobial resistant
salmonellae from minced beef are emerging through
time.

The present study demonstrated that supermarket
meat samples particularly dressed chicken carcass and
pork, were important sources of antimicrobial resistant
Salmonella serotypes for consumers and stressed the
need to regulate the ethical usage of antimicrobials and
regular monitoring of antimicrobial resistance.

Conclusion

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Salmonella
isolates from food items and food handling personnel
is of considerable importance in attempt of supplying
sound and safe food for community people. Antimi-
crobial resistance of Salmonella isolates from food
items may suggest the possible existence of antimi-
crobial resistance at farm level among food animals.
Significant proportions of Salmonella isolates were
resistant for antimicrobials (32.7%), of which 23.5%
were MDR. This could make treatment of humans’
clinical salmonellosis and other bacterial diseases
difficult should food poisoning by similar resistant
Salmonella serotype ensue. Among MDR serotypes,
to up to ten
Salmonella Kentucky was resistant
antimicrobials. The findings also suggest
the need
for developing educational program to address issues
related to the consumption of raw animal products
that might contain antimicrobial resistant Salmonella.
