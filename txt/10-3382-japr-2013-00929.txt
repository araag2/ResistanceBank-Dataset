  SUMMARY 

  The present study was conducted to determine prevalence, virulence gene profile, serotyp-
ing, and antibiotic resistance patterns of Salmonella in birds kept under the backyard system 
in West Bengal, India. The study also incorporated the detection of Salmonella prevalence in 
their environment, including feed, drinking water, utensils, litter, dried manure under the house, 
soil, and eggs, which helped to formulate a biosecurity strategy. The study was conducted in 4 
agro-climatic zones, such as the terai, new alluvial, red laterite, and coastal. Out of 360 samples, 
22 Salmonella isolates (6.1%) were identified. Salmonella were isolated from cloacal swabs 
of 6 birds (15%, n = 40), from 4 feed samples (10%, n = 40), 8 drinking water samples (20%, 
n = 40), and 4 eggs (10%, n = 40). Similar antigenic structure, nucleotide sequence (invA) of 
Salmonella Enteritidis and Typhimurium, and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA banding 
patterns of Salmonella Enteritidis were observed. It seems that the same Salmonella isolate 
was present in feed sample, cloacal swabs, and eggs in the terai zone, whereas, it was found 
in drinking water, birds, and eggs in the new alluvial and in drinking water and birds in the 
coastal zone. A zone-specific biosecurity strategy was formulated based on the findings. The 
isolates were found to be resistant to chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, levofloxacin, 
norfloxacin, and oxytetracycline. None of the isolates possessed genes for major extended spec-
trum β-lactamases. Thus, the present study identified the source of Salmonella contamination 
in the backyard chickens and their eggs in India with possible forms of biosecurity strategies. 
Our study was the first attempt in India to determine the prevalence, virulence gene profile, 
serotyping,  and  antibiotic  resistance  pattern  of  Salmonella  in  backyard  birds,  including  the 
environment and product.

SAMANTA ET AL.: SALMONELLA IN BACKYARD BIRDS

537

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM

Intensive poultry production has arisen in the 
past decades as part of the search for the most 
viable and economical protein sources. In devel-
oping countries such as India, adoption of this 
type  of  intensive  system  is  limited  due  to  the 
lack of resources or lack of utilization as a ratio-
nal choice. In rural and semiurban West Bengal, 
a major egg-producing state in India, access to 
poultry  meat  and  eggs  largely  depends  on  the 
backyard production system [1]. This backyard 
system provides 81% of the total eggs produced 
in  West  Bengal  in  a  year  [2].  However,  such 
backyard flocks make a very minor contribution 
to rural livelihoods, as the net income per bird 
per month ranges from 4 to 13 Indian Rupees for 
an average flock size of 5 to 20 in a household 
[3]. Therefore, the backyard system does not ap-
pear to be a promising industry until the produc-
tion level or flock size is increased [4].

Some  constraints  exist  for  increasing  egg 
production,  such  as  microbial  infection,  due  to 
lack  of  biosecurity  knowledge  among  farmers 
[5].  Furthermore,  microbiological  risk  factors, 
specifically from Salmonella, cause major food-
borne infections in humans. Poultry have mostly 
implicated  in  the  spread  of  Salmonella  [6,  7]; 
reports of Salmonella outbreaks, especially with 
Salmonella  enterica  serovar  Enteritidis,  have 
been  noted  due  to  consumption  of  homemade 
food containing raw eggs or undercooked chick-
en products, leading to hospitalization (15%) and 
death (0.03%) in the United States [8] and other 
countries, such as the Netherlands [9] and Por-
tugal [10]. In India, Salmonella Typhimurium is 
one of the most common nontyphoidal serovars 
detected  in  humans  [11].  Results  from  several 
studies indicated that poultry eggs are the major 
source  of  Salmonella  Typhimurium  and  Enter-
itidis  in  India  [12–14].  However,  those  studies 
are inadequate regarding the prevalence of Sal-
monella serovars in backyard birds, their envi-
ronment, and eggs. A few reports related to the 
prevalence of Salmonella serovars among back-
yard birds were reported in other countries such 
as Argentina [15], Belgium [16], Iran [17], and 
Paraguay  [18].  However,  these  studies  did  not 
incorporate the environmental samples of back-
yard  birds  and  the  prevalence  of  antimicrobial 
resistance genes in the isolated Salmonella spp.

Transmission  of  antimicrobial  resistance 
genes into the nonpathogenic commensal flora 
may  take  place  in  the  intestinal  tract  of  ani-
mals, including birds [19]. Specifically, the ex-
tended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) enzymes 
are  increasingly  expressed  by  many  strains  of 
pathogenic bacteria with a potential for dissemi-
nation.  These  ESBL  diminish  the  activity  of 
wide-spectrum antibiotics, creating major ther-
apeutic difficulties in treatment of the patients 
[20]. Among the ESBL, CTX-M (offering resis-
tance against cephotaxime) production is most 
frequent in Salmonella  and  other Enterobacte-
riaceae isolates [21].

Therefore, the present study was conducted 
to detect the prevalence, virulence gene profile, 
serotyping,  and  antibiotic  resistance  pattern 
of Salmonella serovars in birds kept under the 
backyard system, the major egg-producing sys-
tem in the studied agro-climatic zones. The cur-
rent study also comprised the samples from the 
environment, such as feed, drinking water, uten-
sils,  litter,  swabs  from  the  wall  of  the  poultry 
house, dried manure under the house, soil, and 
eggs. Our study will help to formulate a suitable 
biosecurity strategy to prevent Salmonella con-
tamination in backyard birds and their eggs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Collection of Samples

Three  hundred  sixty  samples  (n  =  360)  for 
bacteriological  analysis  from  birds  kept  in  the 
backyard  system,  their  environment,  and  eggs 
were  collected  from  4  agro-climatic  zones  of 
West Bengal, India (the terai, red laterite, new 
alluvial, and coastal) during July to September. 
The  birds  belonged  to  the  Rhode  Island  Red 
breed, represented both sexes, and were appar-
ently healthy. The birds were divided into 3 age 
groups, 1 (1–4 wk), 2 (5–8 wk), and 3 (>8 wk), 
and 3 flock size groups, flock group 1 (1–10), 
2 (11–18), and 3 (>19). The eggs were collect-
ed from the birds at 20 to 26 wk old (Table 1). 
Birds in each zone were procured from the same 
source and distributed among the farmers at the 
same  time  of  the  year  under  the  Rastriya  Kri-
shi Vikas Yojana project of the University. The 
beneficiary  farmers  did  not  possess  any  exist-
ing flocks of birds. The collection area included

7 mm in both the new alluvial and costal zones.
The cloacal samples, swabs from the walls of 
the poultry houses, and utensils were collected 
aseptically with sterile cotton swabs [22] as per 
the  Office  International  des  Epizooties  recom-
mended  method  [23].  All  the  collected  swabs 
were kept in sterile peptone water [22] for trans-
port. Feed, drinking water, litter, dried manure 
under the house, and soil samples were collected 
aseptically  with  a  sterile  spatula  and  were  put 
into  sterile  collection  vials  for  transport  [22].

(coastal zone; Figure 1). Each of the blocks in 
the collection area maintained 100 to 300 flocks 
composed of 5 to 25 birds in each flock. From 
10 flocks in each agro-climatic zone, 9 different 
types of samples were collected, comprising (1) 
cloacal swabs of the birds (n = 10), (2) feed (4 
g, n = 10), (3) drinking water (10 mL, n = 10), 
(4) utensil swabs (n = 10), (5) litter (4 g, n = 10), 
(6) swab from the wall of the poultry house (n =

10), (8) soil (4 g, n = 10), and (9) their eggs (n = 
10); the total number of samples collected from 
each zone were 90, for a total of 360 from all 
4 zones. The average minimum and maximum 
temperatures,  respectively,  and  rainfall  during 
the sample collection period were 22 and 31°C 
and 8 mm in the terai zone, 27 and 34°C and 5

Procured eggs were kept in sterile plastic reseal-
able bags. All the samples, including the swabs 
in peptone water, were transported to the labora-
tory as reported previously [24].

Processing of Samples

All  the  swabs  (cloacal,  utensil,  and  wall  of 
the poultry house) were taken out from peptone 
water and inoculated into the selenite broth [22] 
aseptically  and  were  incubated  at  37°C  for  24 
h  for  enrichment.  Feed  samples,  litters,  dried 
manures, and soils were also directly inoculated 
into the selenite broth (4 g of sample into 36 mL 
of broth) and incubated for enrichment. Similar-
ly, the drinking water samples were inoculated 
into the selenite broth (5 mL of sample in 45 mL 
of broth). Yolk and white portions of collected 
eggs were aseptically taken, homogenized with 
200 mL of buffered peptone water, incubated at 
37°C,  and  subcultured  in  enrichment  broth  at 
37°C for 24 h [23].

When  the  enrichment  with  selenite  broth 
failed  to  detect  Salmonella  in  utensil  swabs, 
litter, swab from the wall of the poultry house, 
dried manure under the house, and soil, a prima-
ry enrichment in universal preenrichment broth 
[22],  followed  by  a  secondary  enrichment  in 
Rappaport-Vassiliadis broth [22] supplemented 
with 100 µg of rifampin/mL, was performed for 
the detection of Salmonella spp.

Isolation of Salmonella

Following enrichment, one loop-full of cul-
ture  was  streaked  on  brilliant  green  agar  [22] 
and  incubated  at  37°C  for  24  h.  Convex,  pale 
red, translucent colonies were identified on the 
basis of standard biochemical tests, such as cat-
alase, oxidase, indole, methyl-red, Voges-Pros-
kauer, citrate, and growth pattern, in triple sugar 
iron agar [25].

PCR-Based Detection of Salmonella  
Virulence Genes

Bacterial  DNA  for  PCR-based  detection  of 
Salmonella  virulence  genes  was  extracted  as 
previously  indicated  [26].  Virulence  genes  for 
Salmonella (invasin, Salmonella Enteritidis fim-
brial protein) isolates were confirmed by PCR 

using the primer sequences and cycle condition 
of earlier studies [27, 28] with the standard re-
agents in a thermocycler [29, 30]. One each of 
Salmonella (ATCC 13076) and Escherichia coli 
(ATCC  35218)  isolates  were  used  as  positive 
and negative controls, respectively. The ampli-
fied product was visualized by gel documenta-
tion system [31] after electrophoresis in 2% (wt/
vol)  agarose  gel  containing  ethidium  bromide 
(0.5 µg/mL) [32, 33].

Nucleotide Sequencing of the Selected PCR 
Products of the Virulence Genes

Both strands of selected PCR products were 
sequenced  in  an ABI  3730  XL  automated  se-
quencer [34]. Sequence homology searches were 
conducted  using  the  BLAST  algorithm  (www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST).  Sequence  analysis 
and  similarities  or  dissimilarities  between  the 
sequences were detected in DNASTAR MegA-
lign software [35].

Serotyping of the Pathogenic Isolates

All  virulence  gene-possessing  Salmonella 
isolates  were  sent  to  the  National  Salmonella 
and Escherichia Centre, Central Research Insti-
tute (Kasuli, Himachal Pradesh, India), for de-
tection  of  serovar  and  antigenic  structure. The 
serovar was detected by the standard technique 
using  antisera  against  all  of  the  important  se-
rovars.

Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA-PCR

The  molecular  characterization  of  all  the 
virulence  gene-possessing  Salmonella  Enter-
itidis isolates was done by randomly amplified 
polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR) using a 
single  primer,  P1254  (CCGCAGCCAA)  [36], 
in a thermalcycler [30] as per the earlier proto-
col [37]. The PCR products were then electro-
phoresed in 2% (wt/vol) agarose gel containing 
ethidium bromide (0.5 µg/mL) [32, 33].

Phenotypical Detection  
of Antibiotic Resistance

All PCR-confirmed virulent Salmonella iso-
lates were tested for sensitivity and resistance to

different antibiotics by the disc diffusion meth-
od [38]. The antibiotic discs used in our study 
included  ceftriaxone  (30  μg),  ceftizoxime  (30 
μg), cephalexin (30 µg), cephotaxime (30 µg), 
cephaloridine (10 µg), chloramphenicol (30 µg), 
ciprofloxacin  (10  µg),  colistin  (10  µg),  co-tri-
moxazole (25 µg), erythromycin (15 µg), fura-
zolidone (50 µg), gentamicin (10 µg), levofloxa-
cin (5 µg), nalidixic acid (30 µg), nitrofurantoin 
(300  µg),  norfloxacin  (10  µg),  oxytetracycline 
(30 µg), and tetracycline (30 µg) [22].

PCR-Based Detection of ESBL Producers

For the detection of ESBL-producing organ-
isms, PCR for the major ESBL genes (blaTEM, 
blaSHV,  bla  CTX-M)  was  performed  on  all  of  the 
virulent Salmonella isolates, as described previ-
ously [39, 40].

Statistical Analysis

Univariate ANOVA for detection of signifi-
cant difference between isolate numbers of Sal-
monella with age group of the birds, flock size, 
and agro-climatic zone was performed in SPSS 
version  21  [41]. The  correlation  between  tem-
perature and rainfall of the 4 agro-climatic zones 
with the occurrence of Salmonella in backyard 
birds and other samples were analyzed by Chi-
squared test at 95% CI in SPSS version 21 [41].

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In  the  studied  flocks,  farmers  offered  well 
water in the terai and red laterite zones and lo-
cally  available  pond  water  in  the  new  alluvial 
and  coastal  zones  to  the  birds.  Rice,  raw  veg-
etable  waste,  and  seeds  were  used  as  feed  of 
the birds in all 4 zones. In most cases, drinking 
water was not regularly changed in the troughs. 
The birds generally roamed around the farmer’s 
house in the daytime and took shelter at night 
in  poultry  houses  constructed  of  bamboo. The 
birds were called for feed and drinking water at 
a specific time by women on the farms.

Out  of  the  360  samples,  22  isolates  (6.1%) 
of  Salmonella  were  identified  on  the  basis  of 
biochemical tests from cloacal swabs, drinking 
water, feed, and eggs (Table 2). Lower isolation 
rates  were  reported  by  previous  workers,  who 

JAPR: Field Report

found 6, 5.8, and 3.5% Salmonella prevalence in 
backyard chickens in Iran, Belgium, and Para-
guay, respectively [16–18]. Among the 4 studied 
agro-climatic zones, the isolates were obtained 
from 3 zones [i.e., the terai (Jalpaiguri), new al-
luvial  (Howrah),  and  coastal  (South  24  Parga-
nas)]. This pattern of isolation may be due to the 
variation  in  temperature  and  average  rainfall. 
The prevalence of Salmonella was observed sig-
nificantly higher (P < 0.05) in areas of high rain-
fall and comparatively low temperature zones, 
which is in corroboration with earlier work [42].
The 22 Salmonella isolates were distributed 
among cloacal swabs of 6 birds (15%, n = 40), 
4 feed samples (10%, n = 40), 8 drinking water 
samples (20%, n = 40), and 4 eggs (10%, n = 40) 
(Table 2). A similar seroprevalence rate of Sal-
monella (16%) in backyard chickens was found 
in Argentina  [15]. An  equivalent  isolation  rate 
of Salmonella was detected from broiler poultry 
feed  (15%,  n  =  20)  in  Nigeria  [43],  and  from 
the drinking water of broilers (13%, n = 40) in 
Nashville,  Tennessee  [44].  However,  the  inci-
dence of Salmonella in broiler feed and feed in-
gredients was seen to vary widely, between 0 to 
78% depending upon husbandry practices [45]. 
Similarly, Salmonella was isolated from 13% of 
the studied table eggs (n = 184) in Trinidad [46].
All  the  Salmonella  isolates  were  obtained 
from birds of the higher age group (≥8 wk) and 
larger flock size (≥10 birds). A difference (P < 
0.01) was observed in the number of Salmonella 
isolates between age group 2 (5–8 wk) and age 
group 3 (>8 wk) and between age group 1 (1–4 
wk) and age group 3. Similarly, a difference (P 
< 0.05) was observed in the number of Salmo-
nella  isolates  between  flock  group  2  (11–18) 
and 3 (>19) and between flock group 1 (1–10) 
and 3. These findings are in corroboration with 
other researchers who observed that the preva-
lence of Salmonella infection increased with the 
age of the birds [47]. Likewise, in Bangladesh, 
the  highest  prevalence  of  Salmonella  was  de-
tected  at  higher  age  group  (64  wk  and  above) 
of the broilers than the lower age group (16–23 
wk) [48]. Furthermore, similar reports were ob-
served where the Salmonella infection rate in-
creases with the flock size of broiler birds [48, 
49].

The highest isolation rate of Salmonella from 
all kinds of samples was seen in the terai (9/22;

40.9%)  followed  by  the  new  alluvial  (7/22; 
31.8%) and coastal zone (6/22; 27.2%). This re-
sult could be due to high rainfall and compara-
tively  low  temperatures  in  the  terai  zone  (P  < 
0.05) rather than other zones during the sample 
collection period, which is positively correlated 
with  higher  Salmonella  isolation  [42].  How-
ever, no Salmonella was detected from any of 
the collected cloacal swabs, eggs, or other en-
vironmental  samples  in  the  red  laterite  (West 
Midnapur)  zone.  Furthermore,  no  Salmonella 
was  detected  from  utensil  swabs,  litter,  swab 
from  the  wall  of  the  poultry  house,  dried  ma-
nure under the house, or soil collected from all 
the studied agro-climatic zones even after sec-
ondary  enrichment  with  Rappaport-Vassiliadis 
broth.  Similarly,  Salmonella  was  not  detected 
by culture or PCR in the broiler litter samples in 
an earlier study [50]. In contrast, a few previous 
reports showed that the environmental samples 
from the broiler or layer farm samples, such as 
soil, dust, manure, or utensils, may harbor Sal-
monella [51, 52]. A report of Salmonella isola-
tion from backyard bird feed, drinking water, or 
other environmental samples was apparently not 
available  to  compare  with  the  present  finding. 
Probably the presence of Salmonella in the col-
lected samples of the present study was below 
detectable  limits,  even  after  secondary  enrich-
ment, as observed previously [53].

Among  the  22  Salmonella  isolates  identi-
fied  biochemically,  8  isolates  (8/22;  36.3%) 
were found to possess the invA gene following 
PCR. The invA-positive isolates were obtained 

from feed, cloacal swabs, and eggs in the terai 
zone, as well as drinking water, cloacal swabs, 
and eggs in the new alluvial zone and drinking 
water and cloacal swabs in the coastal zone (Ta-
ble 3). The nucleotide sequence of the purified 
invA PCR products (3) of Salmonella Enteriti-
dis isolated from feed, cloacal swabs, and eggs 
in the terai zone and invA PCR products (2) of 
Salmonella Typhimurium isolated from cloacal 
swabs  and  drinking  water  in  the  coastal  zone 
revealed  the  similarities  of  the  isolates  (100% 
cognate)  with  the  invA  of  other  Salmonella 
strains isolated throughout the world (accession 
no:  DQ644618.1,  AM933172.1)  in  a  BLAST 
search  (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). 
All 6 Salmonella Enteritidis isolates were found 
to  possess  the  sefA  gene  following  PCR.  The 
isolates were obtained from feed, cloacal swabs, 
and eggs in the terai zone and drinking water, 
cloacal swabs, and eggs in the new alluvial zone 
(Table 3). The isolates belonged to Salmonella 
Enteritidis (6) and Salmonella Typhimurium (2) 
serovars (Table 3). In southern India, Salmonella 
Enteritidis was solely isolated from 164 cloacal 
swabs of backyard chickens [54]. Similarly, in 
other countries, such as Iran, the number of Sal-
monella  Enteritidis  isolates  (15/27)  was  more 
than  the  number  of  Salmonella  Typhimurium 
(6/27) in backyard chicken, and all of the Sal-
monella  Enteritidis  and  Typhimurium  isolates 
possessed sefA and invA genes in PCR [55].

The  MegAlign  analysis  of  the  3  invA  gene 
sequences of Salmonella Enteritidis and 2 invA 
sequences of Salmonella Typhimurium revealed

similarities. The percent identity analysis detect-
ed 94.4% similarity between the invA sequences 
of Salmonella Enteritidis isolated from cloacal 
swab and feed, 90.2% similarity between cloa-
cal  swabs  and  eggs,  and  85.6%  similarity  be-
tween eggs and feed. Similarly, the percent iden-
tity analysis detected 96.5% similarity between 
the invA sequences of Salmonella Typhimurium. 
The dendogram also revealed 2 invA sequences 
of  Salmonella  Enteritidis  from  cloacal  swabs 
and feed in the terai zone and 2 invA sequences 
of Salmonella Typhimurium from cloacal swabs 
and  drinking  water  in  the  coastal  zone  in  the 
same cluster (Figure 2).

All  the  Salmonella  Enteritidis  isolates  (6) 
were typeable with the primer P1254 in RAPD-
PCR. The RAPD-PCR produced the same band-
ing pattern for 3 Salmonella Enteritidis strains 
isolated from feed, cloacal swabs, and eggs in 
the  terai  zone  and  for  3  Salmonella  Enteriti-
dis  strains  isolated  from  drinking  water,  cloa-
cal  swabs,  and  eggs  in  the  new  alluvial  zone. 
It  seems  that  the  same  Salmonella  Enteritidis 
strain was present in feed samples and birds in 

the terai zone as well as drinking water and birds 
in the new alluvial and the coastal zones due to 
their similarity in antigenic structure, nucleotide 
sequences (invA), and RAPD-PCR banding pat-
terns  (Salmonella  Enteritidis).  Therefore,  the 
feed in the terai zone and drinking water in the 
new alluvial and coastal zones were identified 
as major sources of Salmonella infection in the 
studied birds. Similarly, in the literature, drink-
ing water is considered a major source of sal-
monellosis in poultry [56]. In the new alluvial 
and coastal zones, water collected from the local 
ponds in the vicinity was used for drinking by 
birds.

The ponds were otherwise used for bathing 
and washing of the anus and hands after defeca-
tion by villagers in a remote area unrelated to 
the ponds. The use of the ponds for bathing and 
washing after defecation may make the villagers 
a source of Salmonella contamination, specifi-
cally Salmonella Typhimurium, a major nonty-
phoidal  serovar  detected  in  the  Indian  popula-
tion [11]. Furthermore, infrequent change of the 
water in the drinking trough might aggravate the

SAMANTA ET AL.: SALMONELLA IN BACKYARD BIRDS

contamination level, as isolation of Salmonella 
from 7-d-old poultry drinking water infrequent-
ly changed in Nashville, Tennessee, was report-
ed earlier [44]. In the other studied agro-climatic 
zones, well water was used for drinking by the 
birds, which was free of contamination.

Furthermore,  as  evident  from  the  antigenic 
characteristics,  invA  nucleotide  sequence,  and 
RAPD-PCR  pattern,  the  same  strains  of  Sal-
monella Enteritidis were also isolated from the 
eggs in the terai and alluvial zones. It seems that 
the  feed  and  drinking  water  in  the  both  zones 
acted  as  major  sources  of  Salmonella  Enter-
itidis, which was further transmitted into eggs. 
The transmission might be due to the possession 
of  the  fimbriae,  as  confirmed  by  the  detection 
of  fimbrial  protein  gene  (sefA)  by  PCR  in  the 
isolates,  which  helps  in  effective  colonization 
of  the  bacteria  in  chicken  reproductive  tract 
and subsequent transmission into the eggs [57]. 
However, due to lack of fimbriae as evidenced 
from  PCR,  Salmonella  Typhimurium  isolates 
were  not  detected  in  the  studied  eggs  in  the 
coastal zones where the bacteria were present in 
drinking water and the studied birds.

Thus, based on the identification of the ma-
jor  source  of  Salmonella  in  different  zones  in 
the present study, a need was felt to formulate 
a  biosecurity  strategy  to  prevent  Salmonella 
contamination in backyard birds and their sub-
sequent  transmission  into  eggs,  considered  a 
major source of Salmonella in humans, specifi-
cally  Salmonella  Enteritidis  and  Typhimurium 
in India. The following suggestions based on the 
current study were conveyed to farmers. (1) The 
drinking water for the birds in the new alluvial 
and coastal zones should be potable, preferably 
boiled,  and  changed  frequently  in  troughs.  (2) 
The  feed  mixture  in  the  terai  zone  offered  to 
the  birds  should  be  prepared  (rice)  or  washed 
(seeds,  vegetable  wastes)  with  potable  drink-
ing water. (3) The eggs should be washed with 
sterile water and preserved at cooling tempera-
ture. The formulation was based on the source 
of  infection  in  an  agro-climatic  zone. An  ear-
lier study regarding the survival of Salmonella 
Enteritidis in eggs showed that the numbers of 
surviving organisms was inversely related to the 
storage  temperature  [58],  and  storage  of  eggs 
without prior washing helped to disseminate the 
pathogens within the contents of the eggs [59]. 

Implementation of the biosecurity strategies by 
the  farmers  in  the  studied  zones  might  reduce 
the Salmonella contamination in eggs. Further-
more, implementation will also reduce the bac-
terial load in the birds, which is beneficial for 
backyard farmers as well as for the local com-
mercial poultry farms [15].

All  the  PCR-confirmed  virulent  Salmonella 
isolates  were  found  resistant  to  chlorampheni-
col  (100%),  ciprofloxacin  (100%),  gentami-
cin  (100%),  levofloxacin  (100%),  norfloxacin 
(100%),  oxytetracycline  (100%),  tetracycline 
(100%), co-trimoxazole (75%), and erythromy-
cin (75%). The isolates were sensitive to ceftri-
axone (100%), ceftizoxime (100%), cephalexin 
(100%),  cephotaxime  (100%),  cephaloridine 
(100%),  furazolidone  (75%),  nitrofurantoin 
(62.5%),  nalidixic  acid  (37.5%),  and  colistin 
(25%). However, an intermediate reaction was 
observed against colistin (75%), nalidixic acid 
(62.5%), and nitrofurantoin (37.5%). Similarly, 
the  majority  of  the  Salmonella  isolated  from 
backyard birds in Iran was resistant to tetracy-
cline [17]. In another study in northeastern In-
dia, resistance of poultry Salmonella to tetracy-
cline and chloramphenicol was detected [60]. In 
contrast, in a study in Iran, Salmonella isolates 
from the backyard birds were mostly sensitive 
to norfloxacin [55]. The differences in antibiotic 
resistance  patterns  might  be  due  to  the  differ-
ences in use of antibiotic types in birds in India 
compared with those used in other countries.

None of the isolates possessed major ESBL-
producing  genes  (blaTEM,  blaSHV,  bla  CTX-M),  as 
revealed  by  PCR.  In  the  studied  zones,  third-
generation  cephalosporins  and  ampicillin  were 
apparently  never  used  by  the  farmers  in  the 
backyard birds due to either higher cost or lack 
of poultry preparation.

CONCLUSIONS AND APPLICATIONS

 

 

1.  The  present  study  identified  drinking 
water and feed as the source of Salmo-
nella contamination in the chickens and 
their eggs produced in backyard farming 
systems in 4 agro-climatic zones of In-
dia.

2.  A zone-specific biosecurity strategy was 
developed  to  mitigate  the  Salmonella 
contamination.

3.  Absence of major ESBL genes in Salmo-
nella  isolated  from  the  backyard  birds 
makes these birds a safe food in terms of 
antimicrobial resistance gene transfer.

4.  Adaptation  of  the  biosecurity  strategy 
by the farmers may make backyard birds 
and their products more hygienic.
