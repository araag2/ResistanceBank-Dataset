The effects of animal agriculture on the spread of antibiotic resistance
ABSTRACT
(AR) are cross-cutting and thus require a multidisciplinary perspective. Here we use
ecological, epidemiological, and ethnographic methods to examine populations of
Escherichia coli circulating in the production poultry farming environment versus the
domestic environment in rural Ecuador, where small-scale poultry production em-
ploying nontherapeutic antibiotics is increasingly common. We sampled 262 “pro-
duction birds” (commercially raised broiler chickens and laying hens) and 455
“household birds” (raised for domestic use) and household and coop environmental
samples from 17 villages between 2010 and 2013. We analyzed data on zones of in-
hibition from Kirby-Bauer tests, rather than established clinical breakpoints for AR, to
distinguish between populations of organisms. We saw signiﬁcantly higher levels of
AR in bacteria from production versus household birds;
resistance to either
amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalothin, cefotaxime, and gentamicin was found in 52.8%
of production bird isolates and 16% of household ones. A strain jointly resistant to
the 4 drugs was exclusive to a subset of isolates from production birds (7.6%) and
coop surfaces (6.5%) and was associated with a particular purchase site. The preva-
lence of AR in production birds declined with bird age (P ⬍ 0.01 for all antibiotics
tested except tetracycline, sulﬁsoxazole, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). Farm-
ing status did not impact AR in domestic environments at the household or village
level. Our results suggest that AR associated with small-scale poultry farming is pres-
ent in the immediate production environment and likely originates from sources
outside the study area. These outside sources might be a better place to target con-
trol efforts than local management practices.

In developing countries, small-scale poultry farming employing anti-

biotics as growth promoters is being advanced as an inexpensive source of protein
and income. Here, we present the results of a large ecoepidemiological study exam-
ining patterns of antibiotic resistance (AR) in E. coli isolates from small-scale poultry
production environments versus domestic environments in rural Ecuador, where
such backyard poultry operations have become established over the past decade.
Our previous research in the region suggests that introduction of AR bacteria
through travel and commerce may be an important source of AR in villages of this
region. This report extends the prior analysis by examining small-scale production
chicken farming as a potential source of resistant strains. Our results suggest that AR

strains associated with poultry production likely originate from sources outside the
study area and that these outside sources might be a better place to target control
efforts than local management practices.

Antibiotic resistance (AR) is a growing public health concern in the United States (1)

and globally (2). The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human medicine (3, 4)
and in animal agriculture, where the vast majority of antimicrobials are used (5),
contribute to the evolution and spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens (6). Farmed
animals and the broader environment can serve as reservoirs of AR genes that can be
exchanged across species (7–10). Numerous resistance genes in human pathogens
have environmental origins (11), and the environmental resistome is enriched and
mobilized when soil and water are contaminated with runoff from farms (12) or with
antibiotic residues (5, 13). Multiple pathways link AR in these reservoirs to human
health; epidemiological studies going back to the 1970s show an association between
antibiotic use on farms and colonization with livestock-associated strains in workers
(14) and surrounding communities (15).

Although restricted in developed countries (16), the nontherapeutic use of antibi-
otics in animal husbandry is increasing in many developing countries, fueled by the
rapid growth of poultry production that relies heavily on antibiotics for growth pro-
motion (17, 18). Backyard poultry farming is promoted as an economic development
and nutrition supplementation strategy in Africa, Asia, and Latin America (19, 20). Given
the sustained global increase in poultry and concurrent use of agricultural antibiotics,
there is a need for studies examining connections between animals in intensive
production and the surrounding environment and potential human health impacts,
especially where animals are raised in close proximity to human communities.

In this report, we compare and examine AR data from Escherichia coli populations
circulating in poultry production versus domestic environments in a ﬁeld site in rural
Northwest Ecuador. Our previous research suggests that introduction of AR bacteria
from outside sources may be an important source of AR in villages of this region (21).
This report extends the prior analysis by more closely analyzing one potential source of
AR, small-scale production chicken farming.

RESULTS
Quantitative characterization of poultry production. Monthly census surveys
showed wide variability in the number of production birds raised over time. Of the 17
villages for which monthly data were available, 15 were categorized based on the
maximum number of birds recorded by our surveillance surveys (i.e., the intensity of
production in the villages) during the study period (high intensity, ⬎500 birds, n ⫽ 4;
medium intensity, 150 to 500 birds, n ⫽ 7; low intensity, ⬍150 birds, n ⫽ 4; no data
available, n ⫽ 2; see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Poultry production was
intermittent in all of the villages, with periods when no broilers were raised.
In
high-intensity villages, the size of ﬂocks rarely exceeded 500 during the surveys. At the
time of sampling visits, birds were actively farmed in 10 villages.

Qualitative characterization of poultry production. Ethnographic interviews
conﬁrmed that poultry production varied widely over time and in scale: while some
households periodically maintained ﬂocks of ~10 birds, others housed up to several
hundred. Most backyard coops were located within 50 m of houses in raised open
structures or directly below the family home. Two villages in the region had large
facilities (for housing up to 1,500 birds of multiple ages) built with foreign and local
government aid, located away from other houses, and run cooperatively by a group of
community members.

Ethnography also conﬁrmed that poultry production in this region is highly inter-
mittent and characterized by “boom and bust” cycles. Development projects commonly
provide training, birds, and initial supplies. However, once outside support is with-

drawn, production may become unsustainable due to lack of reinvestment in the ﬂock,
outbreaks of diseases, and other factors negatively impacting yield. Another major
driver of variability in poultry farming is the ﬂuctuating demand inherent in the market.
This is particularly true in remote communities where markets are seasonal or episodic
and driven by demand during holidays.

Additional ethnographic details about poultry production in the region, as well as
results of the chemical analysis of poultry feed, can be found in the supplemental
material.

Sample characterization and susceptibility breakpoints. Counts of isolates
and samples positive for E. coli included in the analysis are shown in Table 1. Household
birds (n ⫽ 360) were sampled in all 17 villages, and production birds (n ⫽ 262) were
actively being raised in 10 villages at the time of sampling. Environmental samples were
collected from all 17 villages. The frequency and timing of sampling events for study
sites are shown in Table S2 and Fig. S2 in the supplemental material. For all drugs, the
custom breakpoint was lower than the ofﬁcial susceptible one, but for most drugs, the
custom breakpoints were in the intermediate range as deﬁned by CLSI. Table S3 shows
the ofﬁcial resistant and susceptible breakpoints deﬁned by CLSI, the custom break-
point values estimated using our approach and subsequently applied in the analysis,
and the percentage of isolates that would be classiﬁed as resistant under each scenario.
Details of the ﬁtted mixture models are available in Fig. S3.

Antibiotic resistance in poultry samples. (i) Production versus household
poultry. Production birds,
including broilers and laying hens, had high levels of
resistance and a notably higher proportion of resistant isolates than household birds
(resistance data were deﬁned using our custom breakpoints). Resistance to tetracycline
was detected in 78% of production birds and 34% of household birds. More than half
of the production bird isolates were resistant to sulﬁsoxazole and trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole (69% and 63%, respectively) compared to 20% and 17%, respectively,
of the isolates from household birds (Table 2). The lowest resistance was to gentamicin
(16% of production and 1% of household bird isolates) and amoxicillin/clavulanate
(18% and 2%, respectively). The difference between production and household bird
isolates was statistically signiﬁcant (P ⬍ 0.01) for all drugs according to the results of
analysis performed using generalized linear mixed models with a binomial identity link
function (GLMM-logit) and was also reﬂected in the data showing signiﬁcantly lower
zones of inhibition (P ⬍ 0.01 for all drugs according to the results determined for
continuous outcome measures using GLMM and analysis of variance [GLMM-ANOVA])
(Fig. 1).

Examining the differences in the modality of zone distributions, we observed a
phenotypic pattern of AR unique to production birds. Distributions for amoxicillin/

clavulanate, cefotaxime, cephalothin, and gentamicin, shown in the top row of Fig. 1,
showed bimodal tendencies for production birds, suggesting a mixed population of
susceptible and resistant strains. Household birds had a unimodal distribution, with the
exclusive presence of strains susceptible to these drugs. We refer here to this particular
phenotypic pattern as a “production bird signature,” as this pattern suggests the
presence of resistant phenotypes unique to production birds and not found in house-
hold birds. In contrast, distributions for all other drugs were bimodal for both types of
poultry, suggesting that the same resistance phenotype is present in both samples,
although the resistance phenotype was more prevalent in production birds for all
drugs.

Resistance to at least one of the production signature drugs was present in 52.8%
of production and 16% of household bird isolates during all sampling visits across all
sites. Simultaneous resistance to the four drugs was found in 7.3% (57/786) of produc-
tion bird isolates. While the phenotype was recovered in every quarter of the study
period when poultry were sampled, 32 of the isolates were from one particular ﬂock of
chicks aged 10 to 14 days and purchased from a large city outside the immediate study
area.

(ii) Production birds by age. The prevalence of resistant phenotypes tended to
decrease with bird age (Fig. 2) for all drugs (P ⬍ 0.05 by GLMM-ANOVA) except those
with the highest resistance levels (i.e., sulﬁsoxazole, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,
and tetracycline). This suggests that production birds are already colonized with strains
resistant to some drugs when they are purchased and that this carriage declines with
age. Age data were not available for household birds, but in comparisons of 105 birds
of the youngest group (⬍2 weeks) to all 360 household ones, the production birds
showed pronounced, characteristic differences in the modality of distributions (i.e., a
“production signature”);
the oldest group
(⬎6 weeks), the modalities of the distributions did not differ (see Fig. S4A and B in the
supplemental material). However, older production birds still retained resistance levels
that were signiﬁcantly higher than those determined for the household ones (P ⬍ 0.01
by GLMM-ANOVA and GLMM-logit).

of AR among these samples differed by the location where chicks were purchased
(Fig. 3). This trend was signiﬁcant for 11 of the 12 drugs (P ⬍ 0.01 by GLMM-logit).
Resistance, particularly to the production bird signature drugs (shown in the top row of
Fig. 3), was always highest for chicks purchased in town B, a large city outside the
immediate study area. Resistance in broilers from towns B and C decreased with age
(see Fig. S5 in the supplemental material). For town A, the direction of the change
depended on the initial starting levels. Irrespective of source, the trend was for levels
of resistance in older birds to converge toward those shown by domestic birds. Data
forms used during sampling recorded only the town from which the birds were sourced
and not the speciﬁc stores. However, the ﬁeld workers noted no more than 5 stores,
and usually 1 to 3, in each of the 3 towns. Our ethnographic interviews with a veterinary
store owner in town B revealed that he regularly supplemented the chicks’ drinking
water with antibiotics as soon as they arrived at his shop and before resale to
customers. The variation in resistance patterns could be at the level of the town or,
more likely, at that of a particular veterinary store.

(iv) Production birds with added antibiotics in water. Detailed surveys on
poultry rearing practices were available for 96 production birds in 20 households in
nine villages. Farmers reported administering penicillin plus streptomycin, tetracycline,
sulfonamide, sulfamethazine plus trimethoprim, piperacillin, erythromycin, sulbactam,
and/or enroﬂoxacin. Of 20 farming households surveyed in detail about poultry-raising
practices, 16 (80%) reported supplementation with antibiotics beyond what is already
available in feed. No signiﬁcant differences were observed between birds with and

FIG 2 Categorical resistance of E. coli isolates from production birds (broilers and laying hens) classified by age of bird. Age data are based on results
of surveys conducted at time of sample collection. n ⴝ 678 isolates from 225 birds had age available (n ⴝ 297 isolates from 105 birds aged <2 weeks;
n ⴝ 165 isolates from 62 birds aged 3 to 5 weeks; n ⴝ 216 isolates from 76 birds aged >6 weeks). Black dots show the frequency of resistant isolates
for each age group and transparent ones the frequency of resistant isolates for birds of unknown age (n ⴝ 108 isolates from 37 birds). Resistance
categorization data are based on custom breakpoints. A generalized linear mixed-effects model of the zone of inhibition regressed against age, with bird
category included as a random effect, showed a significant decline in resistance (P < 0.05) for all drugs with the exception of sulfisoxazole (P ⴝ 0.65),

without reported supplemental antibiotic administration (P ⬎ 0.05 for all drugs by
GLMM-ANOVA and GLMM-logit).

Antibiotic resistance in environmental samples. (i) Surface isolates from
coops and households. Resistance patterns in isolates from birds in coops were
similar to the patterns in those from production birds but different from the patterns
in household isolates. Surface isolates from coops showed higher resistance levels than
surface isolates from the domestic environment (P ⬍ 0.05 by GLMM-logit and GLMM-
ANOVA, with the exception of ampicillin and chloramphenicol) (Fig. 4). In addition,
surface isolates from coops exhibited the production bird signature pattern of resis-
tance (shown in the top row of Fig. 4). Simultaneous resistance to the four signature
drugs was detected in 5 of 72 recovered isolates (6.5%), all from the same site where
the ﬂock of chicks with high prevalence of the same strain was sampled.

(ii) Water and soil isolates by farming history of household. Using household
survey data on past experiences with production poultry farming in all villages, we
divided households into those that had farmed production birds within the previous
year, those that had farmed production birds over 1 year before the sampling event,
and those that had never farmed production birds. We saw no differences in inhibition
zone proﬁles, and their categorical interpretations showed no signiﬁcant differences
across groups for household water samples and only minor differences across groups
for household soil samples (see Fig. S6A and B in the supplemental material).

(iii) Water and soil isolates by farming history of village. We were also
interested in whether poultry farming had an effect on AR proﬁles at a larger scale.
Using the monthly survey data on poultry production, villages were categorized into

100 to 400 broilers, and ⬍100 broilers raised in the year prior to environmental

sampling. Again, we saw only minor differences in inhibition zone proﬁles and their
categorical interpretations across these village groups for household water and soil
samples (see Fig. S7A and B in the supplemental material).

Cluster analysis of resistance patterns across all sample sources. To visualize
the relative similarities of AR patterns across all sample types, we performed hierarchi-
cal clustering analysis using the normalized zones of inhibition. A dendrogram, which
includes bootstrap support values (Fig. 5), shows that production bird and coop surface
isolates form a clade distinct from that seen with household birds, water, and soil
isolates. Coop soils and cloacal isolates from household birds raised in villages with
active farming are closest to the production bird phenotypic pattern.

DISCUSSION
This study used a multidisciplinary approach to examine populations of E. coli circu-
lating in the production versus domestic environment in the context of small-scale
poultry farming in rural Ecuador. We observed high levels of AR in both the production
and household contexts, although the isolates
from production-environment-
associated samples showed substantially higher levels of resistance than isolates from
domestic-environment-associated samples. Production birds exhibited a phenotypic
pattern distinct from that seen with household birds, and this signature pattern was
also prevalent in poultry coops but not in domestic environments. Levels of AR were
higher among younger birds and were associated with a particular source of chicks;
both ﬁndings suggest introduction from outside sources. Poultry farming status was
not associated with AR in isolates from domestic environments in comparisons of

farming to nonfarming households or across villages with different farming intensity
levels. These results suggest that AR strains associated with poultry production likely
originate from sources outside the study area and that these outside sources might be
a better target for control efforts than local management practices.

Phenotypic resistance in production environments. In the E. coli isolates that
we recovered from production birds, we found high levels of resistance to drugs used
in human medicine,
in particular, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and
sulfamethoxazole, to which over half of the isolates were resistant. Rates of resistance
to broad-spectrum antibiotics amoxicillin/clavulanate (23% by CLSI breakpoint and
18.3% by custom breakpoint) and ciproﬂoxacin (32% and 30%, respectively) were
substantially higher than those found via abattoir surveillance carried out on industrial
farms in the United States (9% and ⬍1%, respectively) (22) and in Canada (8%
resistance to nalidixic acid) (23). We found relatively high levels of resistance to
broad-spectrum antibiotics even in the household environment, particularly in drinking
water, where the proportion of isolates resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin,
and cephalothin, drugs used for human medicine, was higher than in household birds.
Surprisingly, resistance to chloramphenicol was uncommon, although our chemical
analysis showed it to be an additive to commercial feed.

In line with studies from other regions in the world, AR in intensively farmed animals
tends to be higher than in free-range or organically raised varieties (24–27). For
example, a study of 20 poultry ﬂocks with over 500 birds from Germany found that

resistance rates and mean MICs of bacteria isolated from organic keeping systems had
lower values than those from conventional ones, especially for E. coli. E. coli and
isolates from free-range Tibetan pigs (n ⫽ 232) had lower levels of
enterococcal
resistance, particularly to tetracycline and other antibiotics known to be used in
farming, than those from intensively raised pigs in other parts of China (28).

Resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefotaxime, cephalothin, and gentamicin was
speciﬁc to production bird isolates. Because AR is passed from the chickens to the
immediate production environment, poultry production may serve as a source of
occupational exposure to AR strains of bacteria. Results of a genotypic analysis of
human isolates from the same study system (K. A. Moser, L. Zhang, I. Spicknall, N.
Braykov, K. Levy, C. F. Marrs, B. Foxman, G. Trueba, W. Cevallos, J. Trostle, and J. N. S.
Eisenberg, unpublished data) point to a molecular basis for these phenotypic group-
ings. Isolates from human chicken farmers had an elevated prevalence of the int1 gene
platform, which was associated with increased resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate,
cephalotin, cefotaxime, and gentamicin; isolates resistant to these drugs were almost
exclusively found in production birds (29).

Extrinsic sources of resistance. We did not detect differences between birds
reportedly receiving antibiotic supplements in the diet, in addition to what is already
present in commercially mixed feed. While this counters the results of other studies (30,
31), the exposure in our data was based on self-reporting and is therefore subject to
recall and/or misclassiﬁcation bias. We ﬁnd more evidence in support of the alternative
explanation that production chickens are colonized with resistant strains in the hatch-
eries prior to their arrival in village coops.

The decline of resistance with production bird age suggests that farmed poultry
start their growth cycle precolonized with antibiotic-resistant bacteria rather than
acquiring resistance in the village environment as a result of any particular farming
practice. This pattern has been previously reported in the literature. For example, a
study of 293 E. coli isolates collected from French laying hens reported higher carriage
in younger birds of blaCTX-M genes that confer resistance to most beta-lactam antibi-
otics (32). A large case-control study in Canada of 197 isolates from broilers sampled
longitudinally and exposed to different antibiotic regimens also found an overall
decrease in the prevalence of resistance between days 7 and 35 in both cases and
controls and a concurrent decrease in carriage of the int1 integron and tet gene (30).

One possible explanation for age-dependent AR is that there is a dilution effect: the
selection pressure of a ﬁxed dose of antimicrobial becomes weaker as animals increase
in mass. Another is that AR strains are “age adapted” to the physiology of younger
hosts: an experimental study of neonatal calves supports this hypothesis, as animals
inoculated with susceptible and resistant E. coli strains shed signiﬁcantly greater
concentrations of the latter, suggesting a ﬁtness advantage for AR strains (33).

While the overall decline in resistance prevalence appears to be part of the normal
course of E. coli community dynamics or changes in the host’s physiology, we also
found that certain phenotypes such as the production bird signature are imported from
outside the study villages. This ﬁnding is supported by the data indicating that chicks
purchased from one particular town, a large regional center where the owner of one of
the town’s few veterinary stores reported heavily supplementing the chicks with
antibiotics, were several times more likely to be resistant to all drugs, especially the
ones with the production bird signature.

The potential of young animals to act as sources of AR suggests that local manage-
ment practices should focus on poultry hatcheries and sources along the distribution
chain to control the spread of AR associated with small-scale poultry farming. Treat-
ment of breeding hens with antibiotics may pass AR bacteria vertically from the hen to
the egg and chick, even if no antibiotics are administered in ovo and/or to the chicks.
Risks of exposure to poultry farms. We found that samples from surfaces of
poultry coops had resistance proﬁles most similar to those of samples from production
birds. The high rates of AR that we observed on the surfaces of poultry production
facilities in these villages may present a more localized occupational risk for acquisition
of AR by poultry farmers and have the potential to impact humans living in the
communities through contact with farmers as well as poultry consumption. In a related
study in the villages under study here, we found that human fecal samples from poultry
farmers exhibited higher levels of phenotypic and genotypic (class-1 integron) resis-
tance, with the prevalence of int1 among farmers of production birds over twice as high
as the prevalence among those who raised household ones (Moser et al., unpublished).
This suggests that occupational exposure to poultry farming is associated with the
carriage of more-resistant strains, similarly to what has been found in larger-scale
industrial operations (15, 24, 34). The idea that farming is an occupational risk for AR is
supported by literature dating back to the 1970s (14; see also a review in reference 35).
Our ﬁndings with respect to AR and coop surfaces suggest that direct handling of birds
is a potential route of transmission.

While we did observe the production signature for AR in the immediate production
environment, this signature production pattern of AR did not occur in the domestic
environment, suggesting that AR selected for by poultry production systems is limited
to the production environment. It is possible that the frequency of sampling and the
culturing methods that we used did not offer enough power to detect the effect of
added systemic antibiotics that other studies have reported (24, 30, 36, 37). However,
it is also possible that the intermittent nature of intensive production does not result
in sufﬁcient pressure to affect bacterial populations within the household environment.
The variability of intensity of poultry farming across space and time has implications for
the spread of AR in this region and likely plays a role in limiting the impact of farming
to the immediate production environment. Many of the drivers of the “boom and bust”
nature of the enterprise that we identiﬁed through ethnography, such as access to
capital and seasonality in markets as barriers to reinvestment, are likely at work in other
developing regions as well.

Our ﬁnding that chloramphenicol is present in commercial poultry is disconcerting.
The use of the drug in human medicine has been limited due to concerns over
development of aplastic anemia, a potentially fatal bone marrow disorder. Chloram-
phenicol use in food animal is not approved in developed countries as studies have
shown residues in meat in concentrations sufﬁcient to suppress bone marrow devel-
opment (38).

Antibiotic Resistance in Small-Scale Poultry Farming

Sensitivity of results to custom breakpoints. This study utilized unique inter-
disciplinary methods to provide insights into the ecology of AR at the interface of
humans and animals. Unlike most environmental studies that summarize AR using
clinical antibiogram methods, we used the full phenotypic resistance proﬁle (i.e., the full
distribution of zones of inhibition), which is a cost-effective way to study the epide-
miology of drug-resistant strains in the absence of molecular data (39, 40). Analyzing
the distribution of zone diameters in addition to categorical interpretations allowed us
to identify a signature phenotypic pattern unique to production birds that suggested
that AR associated with poultry production likely originates outside the studied com-
munities.

We used modeling techniques to classify isolates into resistant and susceptible
bacterial populations after observing from our empirical data that the preestablished
breakpoints did not accurately reﬂect the distributions of zones of inhibition in the
bacterial populations in our study. Our approach is not suitable for classifying clinical
isolates, as it disregards pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties of antibi-
otics, but was better suited to ecological studies because of its ability to empirically
distinguish between the populations of bacteria in our samples. While our major
conclusions were not sensitive to the use of custom susceptibility criteria, we show that
the use of clinical breakpoints may misclassify over 30% of isolates for some antibiotics
(amoxicillin/clavulanate, cephalothin, streptomycin, and enroﬂoxacin), potentially lead-
ing to problems in the interpretation of results (see Table S3 in the supplemental
material). In these cases, use of the CLSI breakpoints would have resulted in classifying
as resistant the isolates that were more likely to belong to the susceptible population.
This point is well illustrated by comparing the results for enroﬂoxacin and ciproﬂoxacin:
the zones of inhibition for these antibiotics, both ﬂuoroquinolones, had a Person
correlation of 0.951, and one would therefore expect the proportions of isolates
resistant to the two antibiotics to be similar. The use of CLSI breakpoints would have
classiﬁed 24% of the isolates as enroﬂoxacin resistant and 12.4% as ciproﬂoxacin
resistant, while our custom breakpoints yielded frequencies of 10.9% and 11%, respec-
tively.

Study limitations and avenues for future research. This study was limited by
several factors. First, because of the nature of our visits to the villages, we were unable
to exploit the wide variability in animal densities over time to look more closely at the
correlation between temporal variability and resistance patterns. Second, our analysis
relies on phenotypic resistance data, and we therefore did not have the opportunity to
account for the multiple genetic determinants and expression patterns that underlie
resistance. Third, we did not test for resistance to two of the three antibiotics that our
chemical analysis found in the poultry feed—virginiamycin and lincomycin, both
narrow-spectrum antibiotics active against Gram-positive bacteria and not against
E. coli. Fourth, we used E. coli as a sentinel organism and relied on culture-based
methods, capturing only a fraction of the complex, multilevel interactions between
environment, host, microorganism, and horizontally transferred genetic elements. Fu-
ture similar studies could use a metagenomic approach to characterize the diversity of
environmental and animal reservoirs as well as the patterns and mechanisms of
resistance gene exchange between these bacterial communities (7).

Despite these limitations, our report provides a multidisciplinary, ecological frame-
work and a large data set to characterize the prevalence of resistance among animals
and household environments in the context of small-scale farming. This type of analysis
is needed to understand the implications of the expansion of small-scale poultry
farming in developing countries currently promoted as an economic development
strategy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study area. The study was conducted between August 2010 and July 2013 in a rural region of
Esmeraldas Province, in northern coastal Ecuador. Community members primarily consume untreated
surface source water, and sanitation facilities are inadequate (41). Our research team has been working
in a total of 31 communities in this region since 2003; the study sites and region are described in detail

elsewhere (21, 42). The present study was conducted in a subset of 17 villages where we were able to
collect environmental and animal samples.

Ethnography. To understand the sociocultural context of the sampling and biological analysis,
ethnographers conducted structured interviews with local stakeholders. Information was gathered on
the practices, organization, economics, and history of poultry farming, including antibiotic use and the
rearing and consumption of different kinds of birds.

Household surveys. We visited villages monthly to record the total number of production birds in
each community. In addition, we conducted a detailed survey within 10 days of sample collection on the
type, size, age, origin, and intended use of ﬂocks, the brands and types of feed used, and the use of
supplementation with antibiotics.

Informed consent was obtained from all participating households. The Institutional Review Boards of
the University of Michigan, Universidad San Francisco de Quito, Trinity College, and Emory University
approved all interactions with human subjects.

Sample collection and laboratory analysis. In villages with production poultry farming, teams
visited (i) all households with active poultry coops and (ii) an equivalent number of nonfarming
households that were located far from coops. If villages had no poultry farming at the time of the visit,
3 to 10 nonfarming households were chosen at random, depending on the size of the village. Additional
details on study design, populations, and sample collection methods are available in the supplemental
material.

Poultry samples. The communities were visited 1 to 4 times between August 2010 and November
2013 to sample “production birds” and “household birds.” Production birds included breeds of laying
hens raised for egg production or broiler chickens that are raised in coops for 6 to 7 weeks before
slaughter. These birds eat formulated feed containing antibiotics and are also commonly given antibi-
otics as prophylaxis via water. Capacities of coops ranged from ~50 to ~100 birds of a single age for a
typical single household coop to ~1,000 birds of multiple ages for the group facility. Thirteen households
in seven villages were engaged in rearing production birds. In each coop, we sampled ﬁve production
birds of each age group (categorized in weeks of age).

Household birds included varietals not intended for commercial sale that are not held in coops, that
eat scraps and ground maize rather than formula feed, and that do not receive antibiotics. We sampled
5 to 10 household birds from each village, regardless of whether the villagers were actively engaged in
production poultry farming.

For all birds, we collected cloacal samples using sterile swabs that were placed in Cary Blair transport
medium (Becton, Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and streaked directly on MacConkey lactose (MKL) agar
for isolation.

Environmental samples. Samples from household drinking water, soil from house surroundings,
and kitchen surfaces were collected from households associated with production or household birds in
order to characterize the domestic environment. In addition, soil and surface samples were collected
from coops in order to characterize the production environment.

Household water. During the ﬁrst half of the study period, between August 2010 and January 2012,
we collected 50-ml water samples from two different household storage containers in Whirl-Pak bags
(Nasco Corp., Fort Atkinson, WI) in the same manner that water was dispensed for drinking. If there was
only one drinking water container available, then the second sample was taken from water used to wash
dishes or bathe. For the remainder of the study period, only one sample per household was obtained
from drinking containers in order to reduce sampling effort, as there were no notable differences in the
E. coli isolates recovered across repeated samples. Samples were processed using membrane ﬁltration for
isolation of E. coli.

Soil. During the ﬁrst half of the study period, we collected two samples of approximately 15 cm3 from
around the house and from around the poultry coop, if one was present. Soil from just below the surface
was placed into a conical tube using a sterile plastic spoon that was discarded after use. Samples were
stored on ice until processing in the laboratory was performed (within 4 to 6 h). For the second part of
the study period, only a single sample was obtained from the household yard, due to the rarity of coops
and difﬁculty in recovering E. coli from these samples.

Surfaces. During the ﬁrst half of the study period, we collected household surface samples from two
locations, namely, where food was prepared (e.g., a cutting board) and where food was eaten (e.g., a
table). A 28-by-30-cm plastic stencil was used to deﬁne a consistent sampling area. Two surface samples
from the inside or outside the coop, which was usually constructed from cement or wood, were also
taken using the same procedures. Surface samples were plated directly onto Chromocult agar and
streaked for isolation. For the second part of the study period, surface samples were not collected due
to the low rate of isolate recovery.

Sample processing. Samples were ﬁrst plated on Chromocult agar, and then presumptive E. coli
colonies were transferred onto MacConkey lactose (MKL) agar for conﬁrmation before replating on
Chromocult was performed to ensure pure isolates. We selected up to four E. coli colonies from soil and
fecal samples and two from water and surface samples to test for AR. More isolates from soil samples
than from water or surfaces were used because we expected higher microbial diversity in soil. Antibiotic
sensitivity was assessed using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method (43) and 12 antibiotics: ampicillin,
amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefotaxime, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, ciproﬂoxacin, enroﬂoxacin, gentami-
cin, streptomycin, sulﬁsoxazole, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline (Becton, Dickinson,
Franklin Lakes, NJ). Zones of inhibition were measured after a 24-h incubation period using digital
calipers.

Antibiotic Resistance in Small-Scale Poultry Farming

Statistical analysis. Our main outcome of interest was the zone of inhibition around each of the
tested antimicrobial discs. A secondary outcome was the categorical
interpretation of the zone
(susceptible or nonsusceptible), based on custom breakpoints that we deﬁned based on zone size
distributions.

Most studies of AR construct antibiograms using categorical interpretations (susceptible, resistant) of
MICs or corresponding disc diffusion zones of inhibition based on externally deﬁned consensus break-
points set by organizations such as the U.S. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) or its
European equivalent (EUCAST). However, these breakpoints have limited utility in distinguishing be-
tween distinct populations of organisms in circulation. Because the primary objective of our study was
to understand the ecological dynamics of AR E. coli within production and domestic environments in our
study villages, we took advantage of the full data on the distributions of zones of inhibition of each
antibiotic for all isolates in order to gain additional insights into the populations of E. coli in the different
environments that we sampled.

We used differences in the modalities of zone distributions to identify populations of isolates with
distinct phenotypic resistance patterns. Where we classiﬁed isolates as resistant or susceptible, we used
empirically derived custom susceptibility breakpoints, because examination of the distributions of the
zones of inhibition showed that the externally deﬁned breakpoints based on wild-type cutoff values (44)
did not accurately reﬂect the local population of E. coli strains. These custom breakpoints have limited
clinical utility, but they improved our ability to distinguish between populations of bacteria in our
sample. More details on the analytical methods to deﬁne susceptibility breakpoints are available in the
supplemental material.

Distributions suggested a population of all resistant or all susceptible bacteria when Hartigans’ dip
statistic (which measures multimodality in a sample) had a P value of ⬎0.1, failing to reject the null
hypothesis of unimodality, or when the estimated proportion of a component in a mixture was lower
than 0.01. Otherwise, the distributions were considered bimodal, suggesting a mixture of susceptible and
resistant bacterial populations.

We compared the kernel density estimates of zone distributions and the percentages of nonsuscep-
tible isolates across categories of interest. We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to model
the outcome of AR. An identity link function was used for continuous outcome measures (inhibition zone
size; GLMM-ANOVA) and a binomial one for the categorical interpretation of the zones (susceptible and
nonsusceptible; GLMM-logit). In all speciﬁcations, we used nested random effects with various intercepts
and slopes for analysis at the sample, household, and village levels to capture unobserved heterogeneity
between the multiple levels and to account for repeated sampling.

The resistance proﬁle for each isolate was also used to perform hierarchical cluster analysis. We
normalized the zones of inhibition, computed Euclidean distances between isolates, and ran a hierar-
chical clustering algorithm with an agglomeration method based on the average distance between
categories, implemented in R’s ﬂashClust package (45). Support values were calculated via multiscale
bootstrap resampling with n ⫽ 1,000 replications.

All analyses were carried out in R version 3.0.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,

Austria).

Poultry feed samples. Prior to the start of the study, we sampled seven varieties of the most
commonly sold brand of feed (Nutril) from a veterinary store in the central trading city of Borbón in July
2009. Every type of feed sold was sampled, including starter, fattening, and ﬁnishing feed for broilers and
layer hens. Samples were tested for the presence of the following antibiotics using mass spectrometry
techniques: lincomycin, virginiamycin, bacitracin, ﬂavomycin, avilomycin, tylosin, nitrofurantoin, chlor-
amphenicol, tetracycline, sulfamethazine, and sulfathiazole. With the exception of nitrofurantoin, the ﬁrst
eight drugs in the panel belong to antibiotic classes that are exclusively used to treat and prevent
infections with Gram-positive bacteria and therefore were not included in susceptibility testing of E. coli
isolates (see Table S1 in the supplemental material for details).
