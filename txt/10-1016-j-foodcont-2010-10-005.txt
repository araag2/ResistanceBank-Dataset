The aim of this study was to investigate the rate of contamination, species identiÔ¨Åcation and antimi-
crobial resistance of thermophilic Campylobacter spp. in pig carcasses during the slaughter process in
a slaughterhouse in Brazil. Two hundred and Ô¨Åfty-nine samples were collected at 7 different stages of the
slaughter process for Campylobacter determination by both qualitative and quantitative methods. Typical
colonies were subjected to API Campy, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antimicrobial
resistance testing. Campylobacter was found in 18.9% of the carcasses and 3.5% of the samples. Dehairing
was the slaughter stage with the highest Campylobacter contamination (55.6%). All Campylobacter strains
were conÔ¨Årmed by real-time PCR and showed multi-drug resistance to cephalothin, nalidixic acid,
norÔ¨Çoxacin, tetracycline and trimethoprim. None of the strains were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic
acid, ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Despite the low occurrence of Campylobacter spp. in pig samples,
the antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter strains represents a considerable risk for the consumption
of pork meat and conÔ¨Årms the need for continuous monitoring of Campylobacter in the pig production
chain.

1. Introduction

In the food industry, Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes,
Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. represent the major potential
causes of food-borne diseases in humans (Franchin, Aidoo, &
Batista, 2005; GhaÔ¨År, China, Dierick, De Zutter, & Daube, 2007).
Although Salmonella has been associated with most cases of food-
borne gastroenteritis in past several years, in the last decade,
Campylobacter has appeared as the leading cause of acute enteritis
in humans in industrialized countries (Bardon, Kolar, Cekanova,
Hejnar, & Koukalova, 2009; GhaÔ¨År et al., 2007; Gu√©vremont,
Nadeau, Sirois, & Quessy, 2006; Humphrey, O‚ÄôBrien, & Madsen,
2007; Pezzotti et al., 2003; Suzuki & Yamamoto, 2009).

Although campylobacteriosis is not associated with high
mortality rates and is generally self-limited, it has a signiÔ¨Åcant
impact on the economy and public health in industrialized coun-
tries (Josefsen, L√ºbeck, Hansen, & Hoorfar, 2004).

The occurrence of Campylobacter spp. in food appears to be fairly
common in European countries (GhaÔ¨År, China, Dierick, Zutter, &
Daube, 2008), and it is responsible for many cases of Guillain-
Barr√© syndrome (GBS) (Blaser, Allos, & Lang, 1997; Caporale et al.,
2006; Sinha, Prasad, Pradhan, Jain, & Jha, 2004; Tam, Rodrigues, &
O‚Äôbrien, 2003). In the United Kingdom, the annual estimated cost
for the treatment of diseases caused by Campylobacter spp. was V
740 million in 2007 (Humphrey et al., 2007).

More recently, concern regarding the prevalence of campylo-
bacteriosis has increased because of the frequent isolation of anti-
microbial-resistant strains from humans and animals. Antimicrobial
resistance develops from the massive use of antimicrobials in
animals for preventive or therapeutic purposes as well as for
increasing the growth rate in modern intensive animal production
systems (Mayrhofer, Paulsen, Smulders, & Hilbert, 2004; Pezzotti
et al., 2003; R√∂nner, Engvall, Andersson, & Kaijser, 2004).

Antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter spp. strains isolated
from animal products has been reported in different countries such
as Italy (Pezzotti et al., 2003), Denmark (Alban, Nielsen, & Dahl,
2008), Korea (Shin & Lee, 2007), Sweden (R√∂nner et al., 2004),
the United States (Olah, Doetkottb, Fakhra, & Loguea, 2006), the
United Kingdom (Little, Richardson, Owen, Pinna, & Threlfall,
2008), Austria (Mayrhofer et al., 2004), Australia (MiÔ¨Çin,

Templeton, & Blackall, 2007), Czech Republic (Bardon et al., 2009)
and Canada (Gu√©vremont et al., 2006; Inglis et al., 2005).

Although Campylobacter contamination in food of animal origin
has been reported in several studies, most research has focused on
poultry and poultry products (Mackiw, Popowski, & Szponar, 2008;
Merem√§e et al., 2010; Sallam, 2007) However, pigs are also
considered potential reservoirs of Campylobacter spp. (Alban et al.,
2008).

The contamination of pork meat may occur at the slaughter-
house itself by cross-contamination during slaughter procedures.
Some recent studies have reported Campylobacter contamination in
pork in European countries (GhaÔ¨År et al., 2008; Little et al., 2008).
However, from an extensive review of the international scientiÔ¨Åc
literature, no reports were found on the occurrence and antimi-
crobial resistance of Campylobacter in pig carcasses in Brazil.
Because pork is one of the most widely consumed meats in the
world, monitoring and obtaining information on Campylobacter
contamination in different countries is highly relevant both for
public health and to the international pork trade.

The aim of the present work was to investigate the prevalence
of thermophilic Campylobacter spp. in pig carcasses during the
slaughter process in Brazil and to identify the strains of Campylo-
bacter spp. both phenotypically and genotypically. The resistance of
the isolates to several antimicrobials was also investigated.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sample collection

Two hundred and Ô¨Åfty-nine samples were collected from 37 pig
carcasses randomly selected along the slaughter line at a big pork
processing plant in the city of Videira, Santa Catarina State, Brazil.
Samples were taken from the same carcass at 7 different steps of
the slaughter process: sticking/bleeding, dehairing, Ô¨Çaming, evis-
ceration, washing, cooling and ham cutting.

At each slaughter step, an area of 100 cm2 from 4 different sites
of the carcass (medial neck, arm, loin and ham) was swabbed by
thoroughly rubbing the surface of the site with sterile swabs in
a total sample area of 400 cm2 per carcass. Immediately after
collection, swabs from 4 different carcass sites, composing one
sample, were pooled together in plastic bags containing 400 mL of
0.1% sterile peptone water, for the determination of Campylobacter
spp. Campylobacter determination was performed less than 30 min
after sample collection.

Sampling methodology was performed according to the Euro-
pean Union recommendations for pig carcass sampling for micro-
biological analysis (European Union, 2001).

2.2. Detection and enumeration of Campylobacter spp.

Because it is known that the Campylobacter genus is sensitive to
laboratory growing conditions, both qualitative and quantitative
methods were used to determine the presence of Campylobacter
spp. in samples. In this manner, the use of both techniques, i.e. pre-
enrichment and direct isolation on agar, minimized recovery limi-
tations inherent of each technique and allowed the recovery of
injured cells and inhibited competing microorganisms, thereby
providing reliable results.

For the detection of thermophilic Campylobacter spp. (qualita-
tive method), 2 mL of the sample diluted in 400 mL of 0.1% sterile
peptone water was transferred to 18 mL of Bolton broth (CM 983;
Oxoid, Basingstoke, Hampshire, England) with selective supple-
ment (SR 208E; Oxoid) and incubated at 36  0.5 C for 4 h, fol-
lowed by further incubation at 42  0.5 C for 44 h under
microaerophilic conditions (5% O2, 10% CO2 and 85% N) (Franchin

et al., 2005). A loop full of enrichment (Bolton broth) was
streaked onto modiÔ¨Åed Bolton agar and incubated at 42  0.5 C in
a microaerophilic atmosphere for 20e44 h. The modiÔ¨Åed Bolton
agar was prepared as follows: dehydrated Bolton broth (CM 983;
Oxoid) was suspended in water, added 1.5% agareagar (HiMedia
Laboratories, Mumbai, India) and 0.5 g/L ferrous sulphate (Carlo
Erba Reagenti, Milan, Italy). After adjusting to pH 7.5 and sterili-
zation by autoclaving at 121 C for 15 min, the medium was cooled
to 50 C and added aseptically 200 ppm of 2,3,5-triphenylte-
trazolium chloride solution (TTC) (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, USA)
sterilized by membrane Ô¨Åltration and selective supplement
(SR 183E; Oxoid) (Franchin et al., 2005; Line, 2001).

For the enumeration of thermophilic Campylobacter (quantita-
tive method), 0.4 mL of the sample diluted in 400 mL of 0.1% sterile
peptone water was streaked onto modiÔ¨Åed Bolton agar and incu-
bated at 42  0.5 C for 24e48 h in a microaerophilic atmosphere.
The results were expressed as colony forming units (CFU) per cm2.
Using the rule of three calculation, one colony grown on the
modiÔ¨Åed Bolton agar was equivalent to 2.5 CFU/cm2, because the
agar was inoculated with 0.4 mL of the sample.

Oxidase-positive, red-coloured colonies that showed curved or
spiral gram-negative rods on microscopy were presumptively
identiÔ¨Åed as Campylobacter spp.

2.3. Biochemical and enzymatic methods for identiÔ¨Åcation

The biochemical and enzymatic system API Campy (bio-
M√©rieux√í, Marcy I‚ÄôEtoile, France) was used for the identiÔ¨Åcation of
the manufacturer‚Äôs
Campylobacter
recommendations.

strains

2.4. Real-time PCR identiÔ¨Åcation

For genotype conÔ¨Årmation, the DNA of the isolates identiÔ¨Åed by
the biochemical enzymatic kit was extracted using the NewGen
Prep and NewGen Preamp (Simbios Biotecnologia, Canoas, Rio
Grande do Sul, Brazil), according to the manufacturer‚Äôs protocol.

For the polymerase chain reaction, 2 mL of DNA extracted from
the strains were added into a microtube and 28 mL of Campylo-
bacter Master Mix Kit (Simbios Biotecnologia, Canoas, Rio Grande
do Sul, Brazil) with Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin,
USA).

Real-time PCR was performed on the Step One Plus thermal
cycler (Applied Biosystems) with the following ampliÔ¨Åcation pro-
gramme: an initial activation step of the enzyme at 95 C for 3 min,
followed by 40 cycles of 95 C for 15 s, and 1 min of annealing and
elongation at 60 C.

As the positive control, a standard strain of Campylobacter jejuni
subsp. Jejuni ATCC 33291 (Remel, Lenexa, Kansas, USA) was sub-
jected to API Campy test and genetic identiÔ¨Åcation by real-time
PCR. For genetic identiÔ¨Åcation, a blank test containing only the
Master Mix Kit and Taq polymerase was adopted as a negative
control.

2.5. Antibiotic susceptibility testing

Isolated cultures were analysed for antimicrobial resistance
using the disc diffusion assay on M√ºller-Hinton agar plates (CM
0337B; Oxoid, Basingstoke, Hampshire, England) containing 5%
(v/v) sheep blood (SUM 04; Newprov, Pinhais, Paran√°, Brazil)
incubated under microaerophilic conditions. The suspension was
adjusted to match the 0.5 McFarland (Probac, Brazil) turbidity
standard as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI, 2005).

Antimicrobial susceptibility was performed using standard discs
(Laborclin, Pinhais, Paran√°, Brazil) containing ampicillin (10 mg),
amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (10 mg), chloramphenicol (30 mg), cipro-
Ô¨Çoxacin (5 mg), nalidixic acid (30 mg), gentamicin (10 mg), clinda-
mycin (2 mg), norÔ¨Çoxacin (10 mg), cephalothin (30 mg), streptomycin
(10 mg), tetracycline (30 mg) and trimethoprim (5 mg). The antibiotics
used in this study were chosen because they are frequently used in
the treatment of human infections (R√∂nner et al., 2004; Shin &
Lee, 2007).

The inhibition zone diameter obtained for ampicillin, chloram-
phenicol, ciproÔ¨Çoxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, clindamycin,
norÔ¨Çoxacin, cephalotin and tetracycline were determined accord-
ing to the criteria proposed for the genus Campylobacter by
Huymans and Turnidge (1997). For amoxicillin/clavulanic acid,
streptomycin and trimethoprim, the inhibition zone diameter was
interpreted according to the breakpoints of the Clinical and Labo-
ratory Standards Institute for sEnterobacteriaceae (CLSI, 2005; Han,
Jang, Choo, Heu, & Ryu, 2007; Luangtongkum, Morishita, Al-Tayeb,
Ison, & Zhang, 2007).

3. Results

The rates of isolation of Campylobacter spp. from the different

pig slaughtering steps are shown in Table 1.

From a total of 259 samples, Campylobacter spp. was isolated in
only 9 (3.5%), indicating a low prevalence. With regard to carcass
contamination, of 37 carcasses, 7 (18.9%) were positive for
Campylobacter spp. From those positive carcasses, 5 (13.5%) showed
Campylobacter spp. contamination in only one collection step,
while the other 2 carcasses (5.4%) were contaminated in more than
one collection step (Table 1).

Of 9 isolates of Campylobacter from the samples, 5 (55.6%) were
found after dehairing, 2 (22.2%) after sticking/bleeding, 1 (11.1%)
after Ô¨Çaming and 1 (11.1%) after the cooling process. Seven isolates
were detected by the qualitative method and 2, by the quantitative
method. Of the Campylobacter spp. isolated using the quantitative
method, one was found in the dehairing step, showing a viable
count of 2.5 CFU/cm2 and the other onedisolated from the cooling
processdshowed a count of 150 CFU/cm2. All the other samples
submitted to quantitative determination showed the number of
viable cells to be lower than 2.5 CFU/cm2.

In accordance with the biochemical and enzymatic identiÔ¨Åca-
tion of the isolates by API Campy, of the 9 cultures, 8 (88.9%) were
identiÔ¨Åed as belonging to the genus Campylobacter and 1 (11.1%) as
belonging to the genus Arcobacter (Table 2).

The strains were subjected to real-time PCR to conÔ¨Årm the
identiÔ¨Åcation of Campylobacter by API Campy. All the 9 cultures
exhibited high correlativity with the chromosomal DNA of the
genus Campylobacter, including the strain identiÔ¨Åed as Arcobacter
according to the API Campy kit.

4. Discussion

The results showed that the occurrence of Campylobacter spp. in
pig samples collected at the slaughterhouse was low, especially
when compared with samples collected from poultry, turkey and
sheep, but showed similar results as samples originating from
cattle (Inglis et al., 2005; Mayhofer et al., 2004). Studies have noted
Campylobacter spp. contamination at levels ranging from 28% to
72% in chicken carcasses and at 0e3.3% in bovine carcasses (GhaÔ¨År
et al., 2007; Ono & Yamamoto, 1999).

The prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in samples evaluated in
this study was 3.5%, similar to the frequency of 0e5% found in
studies in Japan, Austria and United Kingdom for swab samples
(Ono & Yamamoto, 1999, Mayrhofer et al., 2004, Little et al., 2008).
The prevalence in pig carcasses was 18.9%, which was also similar to
that reported by GhaÔ¨År et al. (2008), i.e. 17%, from 1997 to 1999 in
Belgium.

Pig slaughter is an open process with many opportunities for the
contamination of the carcass with pathogenic bacteria; it does not
contain any step that could be considered completely free of
hazard. Thus, contamination needs to be controlled by safety
procedures (Borch, Nesbakken, & Christensen, 1996). Furthermore,
Campylobacter spp. are known to be more frequently found in pig
carcasses than in cattle or sheep carcasses (Franco, 1998).

In this study, 55.5% of Campylobacter spp. were found after
dehairing, 22.2% after sticking/bleeding, 11.1% after Ô¨Çaming and
11.1% after the carcass cooling process.

The contamination observed after sticking/bleeding is probably
due to cross-contamination by microorganisms from the intestinal

Ô¨Çora of the pigs, since different degrees of contamination by
Campylobacter spp. have been recorded in the faeces of these
animals by previous researchers (Adesiyun & Krishnan, 1995;
Modolo, Margato, Gottschalk, Lopes, & De, 1999, Ono &
Yamamoto, 1999).

Among the slaughtering steps sampled, dehairing of carcasses
showed the highest contamination (55.6%). This could occur as
a result of low water renewal or bad temperature control of the
scalding tank. Another important factor for the occurrence of
Campylobacter spp. in carcasses in the dehairing step was related to
the type of the material used on the Ô¨Ångers of the dehairing
machine. As these Ô¨Ångers were made of rubber and attached to the
machine, they could not be easily removed for cleaning and
disinfection, which could lead to the accumulation of residual
material and bacterial growth.

Low Campylobacter spp. counts in pig carcass in different
slaughter steps found in the current study was also found by Gill
and Bryant (1993) which recorded Campylobacter counts ranging
from 30 to 70 CFU/cm2 in samples collected after carcass dehairing
and from 1 to 6 CFU/cm2 in samples obtained after the scorching
and toilette of the carcasses. In their study, GhaÔ¨År et al. (2008)
ranging from <1 CFU/cm2
observed Campylobacter counts
to > 249 CFU/cm2 in samples obtained from pig carcasses collected
immediately after slaughter.

Although the thermophilic species of Campylobacter are recog-
nized as emergent human pathogens, the epidemiological studies
for these microorganisms are recent, and there are yet no legal
standards established for the presence of Campylobacter spp. in
food in Brazil and other countries. However, since the presence of
this pathogen has a great impact on public health and on meat
trading,
the microbiological standards for
Campylobacter spp. in meat will be deÔ¨Åned similar to those for
pathogens such as Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes,
which require the absence of pathogens in 25-g samples.

is likely that

it

In the present work, 33.3% of the isolates were biochemically
and enzymatically identiÔ¨Åed as Campylobacter coli, 33.3% as
Campylobacter jejuni subsp. Jejuni, 22,2% as Campylobacter jejuni
subsp. Doylei and 11,1% as Arcobacter cryaerophilus, 11.1%. However,
PCR conÔ¨Årmed all the isolates to be Campylobacter strains, since all
samples showed high compatibility with the primer used and rapid
replication of their DNA in real-time PCR identiÔ¨Åcation.

The real efÔ¨Åciency of enzymatic and biochemical tests for the
identiÔ¨Åcation of microorganisms is being challenged due to
observations of failure when these tests are compared with genetic
tests. Moran, Scates, and Madden (2009) reported the misidentiÔ¨Å-
cation of 41 strains phenotyped as C. coli, but genotyped as Arco-
bacter butzleri. The same researchers found that a temperature of
25 C under microaerophylic conditions proved to be a suitable
cultivation technique for the conÔ¨Årmation of Campylobacter spp.,
since Campylobacter spp. do not grow well at this temperature,
whereas Arcobacter spp. do grow.

Moreover, one of the factors related to the erroneous identiÔ¨Åca-
tion by the API Campy system is the difÔ¨Åculty in reading the results
presented by this test. On (1996) stated that although the API Campy
system comprises multiple tests for strain identiÔ¨Åcation, it does not
include all the clinically relevant species of Campylobacteriaceae.

Huymans and Turnidge (1997) found 100% correlations between
the results of API Campy and the conventional phenotypic and
biochemical method for Campylobacter spp.
identiÔ¨Åcation for
C. jejuni. However, only 66.6% of Campylobacter lari and 74% of C. coli
were correctly identiÔ¨Åed by both systems. The same authors
observed misidentiÔ¨Åcation of C. coli and C.
lari as Arcobacter
cryaerophilus by API Campy.

Regardless of the strain misidentiÔ¨Åcation described for API
Campy in a few studies, Kuana, Dos Santos, Rodrigues, and Do

Nascimento (2009); Reina, Ros, and Serra (1995) and still consider
this identiÔ¨Åcation system as the best option for Campylobacter
species when more efÔ¨Åcient systems are not available.

Although Campylobacter coli is considered a commensal species
of the intestinal tract of pigs (Quinn, Markey, Carter, Donnelly, &
Leonard, 2002), Campylobacter jejuni represented 55.5% of the
Campylobacter species identiÔ¨Åed in pig carcasses in this study.
Workman, Mathison, and Lavoie (2008) consider pig products an
important source of C. coli as all isolates from pigs tested in their
work were identiÔ¨Åed as belonging to this species. Identical results
were obtained by Shin and Lee (2007). However, several studies
have reported a higher prevalence of Campylobacter jejuni than C.
coli in farm animals (A√ßik & √áetinkaya, 2006; Bae et al., 2005;
Zweifel, Zychowska, & Stephan, 2004;).

The introduction of antimicrobial agents in human and animal
therapy has had a great impact on population growth and food
production. The Ô¨Årst agents were introduced during the 1930s, and
resistance to these drugs gradually emerged with their worldwide
use. However, in the last decade, the isolation of antimicrobial-
resistant microorganisms from farm animals has increased greatly
(EFSA, 2008).

Because Campylobacter spp. is classiÔ¨Åed as an emerging human
pathogen, studies regarding the prevention and control of this
pathogen in the poultry and pig production chains are recent.
Therefore, the criteria for susceptibility to antibiotics and other
parameters for the control of Campylobacter spp. have not been
internationally standardised.

Studies related to the sensitivity to antibiotics of Campylobacter
spp. in different countries show different degrees of resistance to
the same drug (Alban et al., 2008; Armi, Senok, Ismaeel, Al-
Mahmeed, & Botta, 2007; Gebreyes, Thakur, & Morrow, 2005;
Gu√©vremont et al., 2006, Han et al., 2007; Little et al., 2008,
Moran et al., 2009).

In this study, all Campylobacter spp. isolates showed resistance
indicating multi-drug

to at least 5 of the antibiotics tested,
resistance.

Multi-drug resistant strains obtained from pork samples have
been reported by Gebreyes et al. (2005) and (Gu√©vremont et al.,
2006). Resistance of Campylobacter spp.
isolated from other
animal species has also been reported. Little et al. (2008) observed
antibiotic resistance of Campylobacter spp. obtained from cattle and
pigs; (Laungtongkum et al., 2007) veriÔ¨Åed resistance in strains from
poultry; Inglis et al. (2005), from cattle; and Mayrhofer et al. (2004),
from cattle, poultry and pigs.

In the present work, all isolates were sensitive to chloram-
phenicol, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and ampicillin. Sensitivity to
chloramphenicol by all Campylobacter isolates was also observed by
S√°enz et al. (2000) and Gu√©vremont et al. (2006) in pigs, whereas
Bardon et al. (2009) and MiÔ¨Çin et al. (2007) found similar resistance
patterns for Campylobacter spp. obtained from humans and
chickens, respectively.

High resistance to ampicillin for Campylobacter spp. was recor-
ded by Little et al. (2008) (57.3%) and S√°enz et al. (2000) (65.7%) in
samples from pigs and by Han et al. (2007) (43.1%) and MiÔ¨Çin et al.
(2007) (40.8%) in samples from chicken. Contrasting results were
obtained in this study, where none of the strains showed resistance
to ampicillin.

On the other hand, resistance to gentamicin (44.5%) was high
compared to the results obtained by other researchers such as
Gebreyes et al. (2005), Gu√©vremont et al. (2006), Little et al. (2008),
Pezzotti et al. (2003), S√°enz et al. (2000), Shin and Lee (2007) and
who recorded levels of resistance ranging from 0% to 22.2%.

All the isolates were resistant to cephalothin, nalidixic acid,
norÔ¨Çoxacin, tetracycline and trimethoprim. S√°enz et al. (2000) also
observed 100% resistance to cephalothin and nalidixic acid for

706

Campylobacter spp. isolated in Spain and 94.4% tetracycline resis-
tance. Kang et al. (2006) found high resistance to nalidixic acid
(91%) for Campylobacter spp. from chicken products.

Bardon et al. (2009) observed greater resistance of C. jejuni
isolated from poultry than that from human faeces from intestinal
disease patients. The only exception was for tetracycline, for which
higher resistance was noted in human strains. The same authors
also found the greatest resistance of Campylobacter strains to qui-
nolones among various antibiotics. Among Campylobacter strains
isolated from chicken and human samples, 72% and 55% were
resistant to ciproÔ¨Çoxacin, respectively. These results were similar to
those obtained in the current study, in which 77.8% of the isolates
were resistant to ciproÔ¨Çoxacin.

On the other hand, MiÔ¨Çin et al. (2007) found sensitivity to
ciproÔ¨Çoxacin for all the 152 strains of Campylobacter spp. isolated
from chicken in Australia, whereas Inglis et al. (2005) conÔ¨Årmed
ciproÔ¨Çoxacin resistance in only 0.3% of isolates from cattle in
Canada.

Because of the high use of ciproÔ¨Çoxacin in human antimicrobial
therapy, the assessment of Campylobacter spp. resistance to this
antibiotic is particularly relevant to pathogen monitoring programs
(EFSA, 2008).

In 2006, data reported by the European Food Safety Authority
(EFSA) demonstrated a resistance rate of 57% to ciproÔ¨Çoxacin for
Campylobacter spp. in Italy and 53% in Germany. The lowest rate of
resistance to quinolones for Campylobacter spp.
isolated from
chicken in European Union has been observed in the Scandinavian
countries. In Denmark, the resistance to quinolones was 7%, and in
Sweden, no resistance to quinolones was found in C. jejuni isolated
from broilers. These low antimicrobial resistance rates observed in
the Nordic countries were mainly due to the implementation of
national monitoring for pathogens in food of animal origin and the
banning of growth promoters in farm animal production (EFSA,
2008).

Of the 12 antibiotics tested in this study, 7 were not currently
used for growth promotion or prophylactic therapy in pig
production, whereas 5 were used for any of the mentioned
purposes. Among the 3 antibiotics for which 100% of the strains
showed sensitivity (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin and
chloramphenicol), 2 were not used in pig production; among the
remaining 9 antibiotics for which the strains showed some level of
resistance (cephalothin, ciproÔ¨Çoxacin, clindamycin, streptomycin,
gentamicin, nalidixic acid, norÔ¨Çoxacin, tetracycline and trimetho-
prim), 5 were not used in the pig production process. These results
did not allow the Ô¨Årm establishment of a relationship between the
recurrent use of antibiotics in pig production and antimicrobial
resistance. However, Campylobacter antimicrobial resistance can be
related to some speciÔ¨Åc genes, and the dissemination of these
genes of microorganisms from one animal species to another and to
humans is possible. Antimicrobial resistance observed in the
present work could therefore probably be related to the antibiotics
used in broiler production, since in Brazil, animal production
farmers generally raise both broilers and pigs in the same land area
(Aarestrup & Wegener, 1999; Gu√©vremont et al., 2006).

Despite the low number of viable cells and the low frequency of
Campylobacter spp. in pig samples, the risk of contamination by
Campylobacter spp. in pork meat should not be disregarded as it has
been classiÔ¨Åed as an emerging human pathogen. Given the rele-
vance of the genus Campylobacter in human gastroenteritis, its
occurrence in farm animals and the fact that all Campylobacter
strains showed multi-drug resistance, a continuous monitoring of
the prevalence and the antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter
spp. in pig production and in the pork meat product chain is
essential to the implementation of effective policies for controlling
and preventing contamination and infection by this pathogen.
